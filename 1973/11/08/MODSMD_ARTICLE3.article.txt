# Nixon Requests Powers To Fight Energy Pinch
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon urged Congress yesterday to
give him special powers by December
to impose mandatory steps for
reducing energy consumption in the
nation.
The President said in a nationwide
television and radio address that he
was preparing plans for gasoline
rationing. And he said users of home
heating oil, who expected to get at
least as much oil as last year under a
federal allocation program, will have
to get by with 15 percent less than in
1972.
Nixon's top energy adviser, John A.
Love, said in a briefing that mandatory
allocation of the wholesale
distribution of petroleum fuels will be
extended soon from heating oil and

propane gas to all petroleum products.
While Nixon spoke of gasoline
rationing only in terms of a
"contingency plan," Love said
programs were in preparation for
direct consumer rationing of both
gasoline and home-heating oil and he
told a newsman a decision must be
made by December or January at the
latest.
Nixon warned the nation, "We are
heading toward the most acute
shortages of energy since World War
II," with petroleum at least 10, and
perhaps as much as 17 percent, short
of demand.
Doubts About Integrity
Departing at one time from his
prepared text, he said he would take
every action to remove any doubts the
American people may have of his
personal integrity.
After ticking off what he said were
the achievements of his past year,
Nixon acknowledged that "I would be
less than candid if I were not to admit
this has not been an easy year in some
respects."
Saying he had taken note of
requests that he resign, he added, "I
have no intention whatever of walking
away from the job I was elected to do.
As long as I am physically able, I will
continue to work 16 hours a day for
the cause of peace in the world and
prosperity at home."
The President, speaking without
notes, said he would work to remove
any doubts about him which exist.
He said the American people "will
come to realize that I have not
violated the trust they placed in me
when they elected me president of the
United States."
Won't Step Down
Spokesmen for Nixon have
repeatedly said in recent days that he
has no intention of stepping down

despite calls for his resignation by
some senators, influential publications
such as The New York Times and
Time magazine and thousands of
Americans who wrote and wired
criticism of Nixon to Washington after
he fired Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox.
Steps
Returning to the energy shortage,
Nixon announced these steps:
— "I am directing that industries
and utilities which use coal — our most
abundant resource — be prevented
from converting to oil in the
immediate future." Love said this
regulation will be forthcoming in
about 10 days.
— "Efforts will also be made to
convert power plants from the use of
oil to the use of coal." Love said some
pressure could be brought through the
allocation program until authorizing
legislation is passed.
— "We are allocating reduced
quantities of fuel for aircraft. This will
lead to a cutback of more than 10
percent in the number of flights and
some rescheduling in arrival and
departure times."
— "There will be reductions of
approximately 15 percent in the
supply of heating oil for homes,
offices and other establishments. To
be sure that there is enough oil to go
around for the entire winter, it will be
essential for all of us to live and work
in lower temperatures."
— "In offices, factories and
commercial establishments, we must
ask that you achieve the equivalent of
a 10-degree reduction by either
lowering the thermostat or curtailing
working hours."
— "'We must be prepared to take
additional steps and for that purpose,
additional authorities must be
provided by the Congress." Congress is
already considering an emergency
energy act with administration
cooperation and Nixon said: "It is
imperative for this legislation to be on
my desk for signature before the
Congress recesses in December."
Nixon called for a reduction in
home-heating temperatures and added:
"Incidentally, my doctor tells me
that in a temperature of 66-68 degrees,
you're really more healthy than when
it's 75-78 degrees, if that's any
comfort."

the cause of peace in the world and
prosperity at home."
The President, speaking without
notes, said he would work to remove
any doubts about him which exist.
He said the American people "will
come to realize that I have not
violated the trust they placed in me
when they elected me president of the
United States."
Won't Step Down
Spokesmen for Nixon have
repeatedly said in recent days that he
has no intention of stepping down

despite calls for his resignation by
some senators, influential publications
such as The New York Times and
Time magazine and thousands of
Americans who wrote and wired
criticism of Nixon to Washington after
he fired Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox.
Steps
Returning to the energy shortage,
Nixon announced these steps:
— "I am directing that industries
and utilities which use coal — our most
abundant resource — be prevented
from converting to oil in the
immediate future." Love said this
regulation will be forthcoming in
about 10 days.
— "Efforts will also be made to
convert power plants from the use of
oil to the use of coal." Love said some
pressure could be brought through the
allocation program until authorizing
legislation is passed.
— "We are allocating reduced
quantities of fuel for aircraft. This will
lead to a cutback of more than 10
percent in the number of flights and
some rescheduling in arrival and
departure times."
— "There will be reductions of
approximately 15 percent in the
supply of heating oil for homes,
offices and other establishments. To
be sure that there is enough oil to go
around for the entire winter, it will be
essential for all of us to live and work
in lower temperatures."
— "In offices, factories and
commercial establishments, we must
ask that you achieve the equivalent of
a 10-degree reduction by either
lowering the thermostat or curtailing
working hours."
— "'We must be prepared to take
additional steps and for that purpose,
additional authorities must be
provided by the Congress." Congress is
already considering an emergency
energy act with administration
cooperation and Nixon said: "It is
imperative for this legislation to be on
my desk for signature before the
Congress recesses in December."
Nixon called for a reduction in
home-heating temperatures and added:
"Incidentally, my doctor tells me
that in a temperature of 66-68 degrees,
you're really more healthy than when
it's 75-78 degrees, if that's any
comfort."
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon urged Congress yesterday to
give him special powers by December
to impose mandatory steps for
reducing energy consumption in the
nation.
The President said in a nationwide
television and radio address that he
was preparing plans for gasoline
rationing. And he said users of home
heating oil, who expected to get at
least as much oil as last year under a
federal allocation program, will have
to get by with 15 percent less than in
1972.
Nixon's top energy adviser, John A.
Love, said in a briefing that mandatory
allocation of the wholesale
distribution of petroleum fuels will be
extended soon from heating oil and

propane gas to all petroleum products.
While Nixon spoke of gasoline
rationing only in terms of a
"contingency plan," Love said
programs were in preparation for
direct consumer rationing of both
gasoline and home-heating oil and he
told a newsman a decision must be
made by December or January at the
latest.
Nixon warned the nation, "We are
heading toward the most acute
shortages of energy since World War
II," with petroleum at least 10, and
perhaps as much as 17 percent, short
of demand.
Doubts About Integrity
Departing at one time from his
prepared text, he said he would take
every action to remove any doubts the
American people may have of his
personal integrity.
After ticking off what he said were
the achievements of his past year,
Nixon acknowledged that "I would be
less than candid if I were not to admit
this has not been an easy year in some
respects."
Saying he had taken note of
requests that he resign, he added, "I
have no intention whatever of walking
away from the job I was elected to do.
As long as I am physically able, I will
continue to work 16 hours a day for
the cause of peace in the world and
prosperity at home."
The President, speaking without
notes, said he would work to remove
any doubts about him which exist.
He said the American people "will
come to realize that I have not
