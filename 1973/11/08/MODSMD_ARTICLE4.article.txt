# Legislator Criticizes 'Created' Oil Crisis
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
State Sen. Mervyn Dymally, D-Los
Angeles, yesterday criticized oil
companies for "creating the oil crisis."
He proposed developing an energy
resources board to audit the supply,
refinement and production operations
of California oil companies.
Speaking to a small group of
students at Tresidder Union, the
candidate for lieutenant governor
called the defeat of Proposition One a
"return to the politics of reason." He
accused Gov. Ronald Reagan of
"abusing executive power" while
campaigning for the bill.
Dymally advocated amending the
Dymally-Sieroty Act of 1968, which
provided $2 million to build child care
centers for low income families.
His proposed amendment would
direct state funds to municipalities as
well as school districts. "The city
ought to get into the child care
business," Dymally said.
The senator also proposed creating
state-wide job training programs for

low income mothers who wish to
return to work.
According to Dymally, the state
this year replaced a $45 million federal
cutback in child care grants with
surplus state funds. He called a law
releasing the surplus funds "one of the
few good bills" Reagan has signed in
his administration.
However, the state is "just holding
the line," without financing new day
care centers and training programs,
Dymally said.
The senator criticized Reagan for
"harping on the welfare fraud." He
said the governor falsely implied that
welfare recipients did not want to
work when most people on welfare —
low-income mothers, blind, aged and
handicapped people, for instance —
cannot work.
Dymally also discussed his proposal
for a state-wide lottery, which would
provide $100 million each year for
education.
He maintained that the lottery
