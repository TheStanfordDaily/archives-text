# Lunde Sees Conflict Between Law, Psychiatry
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Psychiatrists in the witness chair are
defending not only their patients but also
their profession. More is at issue than the
defendant's sanity. In the courtroom,
psychiatry stands trial.
From Stanford psychiatrist Dr. Donald
Lunde's experience in court arguing for the
insanity of criminals like Herbert Mullin and
John Linley Frazier, he maintains that law
and psychiatry bring out the worst in each
other where they overlap.
Lunde has remained aloof so far from the
current trial of Edmund Emil Kemper 111,
although he has consulted with Kemper since
his arrest last May, when he confessed to the
murders of six coeds, his mother and her
friend.
M'Naghten Rule
California law requires that a psychiatrist
establish a defendant's insanity on grounds
specified by the M'Naghten rule, which dates
back to mid-nineteenth century England.
Kemper, however defies the rules.
"He's not a classic anything. He has a
syndrome unto himself — the Kemper
syndrome," Lunde says."It probably happens
once a century. He's a guy that becomes a
household word, like Jack the Ripper."
The M'Naughten rule states the defense
must prove that the accused had no
knowledge of the nature and quality of his
crime, or if he did, that he did not know he
was doing wrong.
Lunde lambasts these legal labels, quoting a
colleague who once said derisively that the

law simplistically tries to "separate the mad
from the bad." Lunde explains, "The scheme
assumes there are just two kinds of people —
those who know what's wrong and those who
don't. Then it says that this is all you have to
know to judge their sanity."
The so-called "right-and-wrong" test he
describes is given to criminals to measure the
logic of their reasoning. Critics charge that it
unscientifically abstracts one mental process
— the cognitive — from the whole mental
make-up.
Lunde asserts that a man may be able to
reason logically from insane premises. For
example, Herbert Mullin reasoned coherently
and articulately that his murder of 10
individuals, or what he termed "minor
cataclysms," would forestall a major
cataclysm like an earthquake.
Kemper
In the case of Kemper, neither legal
definitions of insanity nor psychology
textbook descriptions of the mentally ill are
applicable. Lunde says, "We've even given him
a chromosone test for the XYY characteristic,
and a sodium amytal test — known as the
'truth serum.' I've interviewed him
extensively, but after seeing him for months, I
could not find anything that hung together."
His conclusions came after six months
spent researching Kemper's background. An
obsession with death and sexual fantasies
extends back to Kemper's early childhood.
"His ideas haven't changed much in 20 years,"
Lunde says.
"In the second or third grade, he used to

play 'the gas chamber game,'" Lunde
explains. His sister would pretend she was
turning on the gas, and he would writhe in
ecstacy on the floor. "He had a kind of ritual.
He was the one who wrote the script," Lunde
says.
Airtight Case
Despite evidence of psychological
abnormalities, Lunde explains he does not
have an airtight case establishing Kemper's
insanity along prescribed legal grounds.
Lunde's reluctance to take part in the
Kemper trial stems, in part, from fear that his
testimony could possibly be misconstrued to
corroborate the prosecution's stance. "This
would be the lowest blow of all," he says.
There are, in addition, other factors
muddying Kemper's trial, and Lunde would
like to keep clean. Psychiatrists, hired by both
the prosecution and the defense to battle out
the insanity issue, have reduced the
courtroom to "a theater of the absurd,"
Lunde asserts.
Prostitution
One veteran court officer has charged that
these psychiatrists are no better than
prostitutes selling out to the highest bidder.
Lunde deprecates those members of his
profession who make their living off the
court, and criticizes the legal system as well.
Central to the problem in court is the jury
which is usually not attuned to the delicate
problems in psychiatry. Lunde complains,
"You can't teach a jury a course in
psychology in two or three days, but that's
usually what you end up trying to do."

He suggests juries be composed of people
who "know something about the mentally ill
and know about alternatives that are
available." A panel of judges should hear and
rule on the testimony of psychiatrists, he says.
Scapegoat
Lunde's frustration with juries peaked
when a juror once confided after a trial that
he really thought the accused was insane, but
was afraid to vote accordingly out of fear that
psychiatrists would release the man.
Psychiatrists are often scapegoats for
delinquent parole boards, Lunde asserts. For
example, a widespread notion blames
psychiatrists for discharging Kemper from
Atascadero State Hospital, to which he was
committed for killing his grandparents when
he was 15. Lunde contends that a parole
board composed of 7 ex-policemen and a
retired dentist released him against
psychiatrists' recommendations.
Kemper became eligible for parole when he
turned 21 and left the jurisdiction of juvenile
court. Psychiatrists warned that if he were
ever parolled, he should be separated from his
mother, who seemed to arouse his aggression.
Instead. Kemper was discharged into his
mother's custody. 'The problem is that
nobody listens to psychiatrists," Lunde
complains.
Treatment
When the psychiatrist can help, his advice
goes unheeded, and in situations where he
feels unqualified to comment, "we are being
forced to deal with the issues," Lunde says.
The most perplexing problems deal with

the causes of psychological disorders and
predictions of their occurrence. "The larger,
more important question is just what's the
best thing to do with someone who is
admittedly dangerous but possibly treatable,"
Lunde says.
"Treatment is what most doctors are into,"
and what the legal and penal systems ignore,
Lunde contends. He compares mental illness
to three major causes of death in America —
heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. "Nobody
knows what causes them, and nobody can
predict them. The state of the two arts of
medicine and psychiatry are not that far
apart. Our function is to help the patient
function and feel better," Lunde says.
Ethical Problem
"What I am capable of addressing is how
Kemper and other patients like Kemper
should be treated. However, basically, this
advice is irrelevant to what they're asking in
court," Lunde explains.
Treatment is a controversial issue posing
tangled ethical problems for Lunde. "It's a
dangerous notion," he muses. "Is it right to
lock people up for the way they think?"
After much courtroom experience, Lunde
looks back on his first case, when at the
prompting of a personal friend, he evaluated a
defendant's mental condition. "He asked me
to do it just one time only," Lunde recalls. It
was a line that even a psychiatrist could fall
for, and now he's hooked trying to change a
system he thinks needs help, he says with a
laugh. 'That's a line you should learn to look
out for."

explains. His sister would pretend she was
turning on the gas, and he would writhe in
ecstacy on the floor. "He had a kind of ritual.
He was the one who wrote the script," Lunde
says.
Airtight Case
Despite evidence of psychological
abnormalities, Lunde explains he does not
have an airtight case establishing Kemper's
insanity along prescribed legal grounds.
Lunde's reluctance to take part in the
Kemper trial stems, in part, from fear that his
testimony could possibly be misconstrued to
corroborate the prosecution's stance. "This
would be the lowest blow of all," he says.
There are, in addition, other factors
muddying Kemper's trial, and Lunde would
like to keep clean. Psychiatrists, hired by both
the prosecution and the defense to battle out
the insanity issue, have reduced the
courtroom to "a theater of the absurd,"
Lunde asserts.
Prostitution
One veteran court officer has charged that
these psychiatrists are no better than
prostitutes selling out to the highest bidder.
Lunde deprecates those members of his
profession who make their living off the
court, and criticizes the legal system as well.
Central to the problem in court is the jury
which is usually not attuned to the delicate
problems in psychiatry. Lunde complains,
"You can't teach a jury a course in
psychology in two or three days, but that's
usually what you end up trying to do."

He suggests juries be composed of people
who "know something about the mentally ill
and know about alternatives that are
available." A panel of judges should hear and
rule on the testimony of psychiatrists, he says.
Scapegoat
Lunde's frustration with juries peaked
when a juror once confided after a trial that
he really thought the accused was insane, but
was afraid to vote accordingly out of fear that
psychiatrists would release the man.
Psychiatrists are often scapegoats for
delinquent parole boards, Lunde asserts. For
example, a widespread notion blames
psychiatrists for discharging Kemper from
Atascadero State Hospital, to which he was
committed for killing his grandparents when
he was 15. Lunde contends that a parole
board composed of 7 ex-policemen and a
retired dentist released him against
psychiatrists' recommendations.
Kemper became eligible for parole when he
turned 21 and left the jurisdiction of juvenile
court. Psychiatrists warned that if he were
ever parolled, he should be separated from his
mother, who seemed to arouse his aggression.
Instead. Kemper was discharged into his
mother's custody. 'The problem is that
nobody listens to psychiatrists," Lunde
complains.
Treatment
When the psychiatrist can help, his advice
goes unheeded, and in situations where he
feels unqualified to comment, "we are being
forced to deal with the issues," Lunde says.
The most perplexing problems deal with

the causes of psychological disorders and
predictions of their occurrence. "The larger,
more important question is just what's the
best thing to do with someone who is
admittedly dangerous but possibly treatable,"
Lunde says.
"Treatment is what most doctors are into,"
and what the legal and penal systems ignore,
Lunde contends. He compares mental illness
to three major causes of death in America —
heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. "Nobody
knows what causes them, and nobody can
predict them. The state of the two arts of
medicine and psychiatry are not that far
apart. Our function is to help the patient
function and feel better," Lunde says.
Ethical Problem
"What I am capable of addressing is how
Kemper and other patients like Kemper
should be treated. However, basically, this
advice is irrelevant to what they're asking in
court," Lunde explains.
Treatment is a controversial issue posing
tangled ethical problems for Lunde. "It's a
dangerous notion," he muses. "Is it right to
lock people up for the way they think?"
After much courtroom experience, Lunde
looks back on his first case, when at the
prompting of a personal friend, he evaluated a
defendant's mental condition. "He asked me
to do it just one time only," Lunde recalls. It
was a line that even a psychiatrist could fall
for, and now he's hooked trying to change a
system he thinks needs help, he says with a
laugh. 'That's a line you should learn to look
out for."
Psychiatrists in the witness chair are
defending not only their patients but also
their profession. More is at issue than the
defendant's sanity. In the courtroom,
psychiatry stands trial.
From Stanford psychiatrist Dr. Donald
Lunde's experience in court arguing for the
insanity of criminals like Herbert Mullin and
John Linley Frazier, he maintains that law
and psychiatry bring out the worst in each
other where they overlap.
Lunde has remained aloof so far from the
current trial of Edmund Emil Kemper 111,
although he has consulted with Kemper since
his arrest last May, when he confessed to the
murders of six coeds, his mother and her
friend.
M'Naghten Rule
California law requires that a psychiatrist
establish a defendant's insanity on grounds
specified by the M'Naghten rule, which dates
back to mid-nineteenth century England.
Kemper, however defies the rules.
"He's not a classic anything. He has a
syndrome unto himself — the Kemper
syndrome," Lunde says."It probably happens
once a century. He's a guy that becomes a
household word, like Jack the Ripper."
The M'Naughten rule states the defense
must prove that the accused had no
knowledge of the nature and quality of his
crime, or if he did, that he did not know he
was doing wrong.
Lunde lambasts these legal labels, quoting a
colleague who once said derisively that the

law simplistically tries to "separate the mad
from the bad." Lunde explains, "The scheme
assumes there are just two kinds of people —
those who know what's wrong and those who
don't. Then it says that this is all you have to
know to judge their sanity."
The so-called "right-and-wrong" test he
describes is given to criminals to measure the
logic of their reasoning. Critics charge that it
unscientifically abstracts one mental process
— the cognitive — from the whole mental
make-up.
Lunde asserts that a man may be able to
reason logically from insane premises. For
example, Herbert Mullin reasoned coherently
and articulately that his murder of 10
individuals, or what he termed "minor
cataclysms," would forestall a major
cataclysm like an earthquake.
Kemper
In the case of Kemper, neither legal
definitions of insanity nor psychology
textbook descriptions of the mentally ill are
applicable. Lunde says, "We've even given him
a chromosone test for the XYY characteristic,
and a sodium amytal test — known as the
'truth serum.' I've interviewed him
extensively, but after seeing him for months, I
could not find anything that hung together."
His conclusions came after six months
spent researching Kemper's background. An
obsession with death and sexual fantasies
extends back to Kemper's early childhood.
"His ideas haven't changed much in 20 years,"
Lunde says.
"In the second or third grade, he used to

play 'the gas chamber game,'" Lunde
explains. His sister would pretend she was
turning on the gas, and he would writhe in
ecstacy on the floor. "He had a kind of ritual.

admittedly dangerous but possibly treatable,"
Lunde says.
"Treatment is what most doctors are into,"
and what the legal and penal systems ignore,
Lunde contends. He compares mental illness
to three major causes of death in America —
heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. "Nobody
knows what causes them, and nobody can
predict them. The state of the two arts of
medicine and psychiatry are not that far
apart. Our function is to help the patient
function and feel better," Lunde says.
Ethical Problem
"What I am capable of addressing is how
Kemper and other patients like Kemper
should be treated. However, basically, this
advice is irrelevant to what they're asking in
court," Lunde explains.
Treatment is a controversial issue posing
tangled ethical problems for Lunde. "It's a
dangerous notion," he muses. "Is it right to
lock people up for the way they think?"
After much courtroom experience, Lunde
looks back on his first case, when at the
prompting of a personal friend, he evaluated a
defendant's mental condition. "He asked me
to do it just one time only," Lunde recalls. It
was a line that even a psychiatrist could fall
for, and now he's hooked trying to change a
system he thinks needs help, he says with a
laugh. 'That's a line you should learn to look
out for."
Psychiatrists in the witness chair are
defending not only their patients but also
their profession. More is at issue than the
defendant's sanity. In the courtroom,
psychiatry stands trial.
From Stanford psychiatrist Dr. Donald
Lunde's experience in court arguing for the
insanity of criminals like Herbert Mullin and
John Linley Frazier, he maintains that law
and psychiatry bring out the worst in each
other where they overlap.
Lunde has remained aloof so far from the
current trial of Edmund Emil Kemper 111,
although he has consulted with Kemper since
his arrest last May, when he confessed to the
murders of six coeds, his mother and her
friend.
M'Naghten Rule
California law requires that a psychiatrist
establish a defendant's insanity on grounds
specified by the M'Naghten rule, which dates
back to mid-nineteenth century England.
Kemper, however defies the rules.
"He's not a classic anything. He has a
syndrome unto himself — the Kemper
syndrome," Lunde says."It probably happens
once a century. He's a guy that becomes a
household word, like Jack the Ripper."
The M'Naughten rule states the defense
must prove that the accused had no
knowledge of the nature and quality of his
crime, or if he did, that he did not know he
was doing wrong.
Lunde lambasts these legal labels, quoting a
colleague who once said derisively that the

law simplistically tries to "separate the mad
from the bad." Lunde explains, "The scheme
assumes there are just two kinds of people —
those who know what's wrong and those who
don't. Then it says that this is all you have to
know to judge their sanity."
The so-called "right-and-wrong" test he
describes is given to criminals to measure the
logic of their reasoning. Critics charge that it
unscientifically abstracts one mental process
— the cognitive — from the whole mental
make-up.
Lunde asserts that a man may be able to
reason logically from insane premises. For
example, Herbert Mullin reasoned coherently
and articulately that his murder of 10
individuals, or what he termed "minor
cataclysms," would forestall a major
cataclysm like an earthquake.
Kemper
In the case of Kemper, neither legal
definitions of insanity nor psychology
textbook descriptions of the mentally ill are
applicable. Lunde says, "We've even given him
a chromosone test for the XYY characteristic,
and a sodium amytal test — known as the
'truth serum.' I've interviewed him
extensively, but after seeing him for months, I
could not find anything that hung together."
His conclusions came after six months
spent researching Kemper's background. An
obsession with death and sexual fantasies
extends back to Kemper's early childhood.
"His ideas haven't changed much in 20 years,"
Lunde says.
"In the second or third grade, he used to

play 'the gas chamber game,'" Lunde
explains. His sister would pretend she was
turning on the gas, and he would writhe in
ecstacy on the floor. "He had a kind of ritual.
He was the one who wrote the script," Lunde
says.
Airtight Case
Despite evidence of psychological
abnormalities, Lunde explains he does not
have an airtight case establishing Kemper's
insanity along prescribed legal grounds.
Lunde's reluctance to take part in the
Kemper trial stems, in part, from fear that his
testimony could possibly be misconstrued to
corroborate the prosecution's stance. "This
would be the lowest blow of all," he says.
There are, in addition, other factors
muddying Kemper's trial, and Lunde would
like to keep clean. Psychiatrists, hired by both
the prosecution and the defense to battle out
the insanity issue, have reduced the
courtroom to "a theater of the absurd,"
Lunde asserts.
Prostitution
One veteran court officer has charged that
these psychiatrists are no better than
prostitutes selling out to the highest bidder.
Lunde deprecates those members of his
profession who make their living off the
court, and criticizes the legal system as well.
Central to the problem in court is the jury
which is usually not attuned to the delicate
problems in psychiatry. Lunde complains,
"You can't teach a jury a course in
psychology in two or three days, but that's
usually what you end up trying to do."

He suggests juries be composed of people
who "know something about the mentally ill
and know about alternatives that are
available." A panel of judges should hear and
rule on the testimony of psychiatrists, he says.
Scapegoat
Lunde's frustration with juries peaked
when a juror once confided after a trial that
he really thought the accused was insane, but
was afraid to vote accordingly out of fear that
psychiatrists would release the man.
Psychiatrists are often scapegoats for
delinquent parole boards, Lunde asserts. For
example, a widespread notion blames
psychiatrists for discharging Kemper from
Atascadero State Hospital, to which he was
committed for killing his grandparents when
he was 15. Lunde contends that a parole
board composed of 7 ex-policemen and a
retired dentist released him against
psychiatrists' recommendations.
Kemper became eligible for parole when he
turned 21 and left the jurisdiction of juvenile
court. Psychiatrists warned that if he were
ever parolled, he should be separated from his
mother, who seemed to arouse his aggression.
Instead. Kemper was discharged into his
mother's custody. 'The problem is that
nobody listens to psychiatrists," Lunde
complains.
Treatment
When the psychiatrist can help, his advice
goes unheeded, and in situations where he
feels unqualified to comment, "we are being
forced to deal with the issues," Lunde says.
The most perplexing problems deal with

the causes of psychological disorders and
predictions of their occurrence. "The larger,
more important question is just what's the
best thing to do with someone who is
admittedly dangerous but possibly treatable,"
Lunde says.
"Treatment is what most doctors are into,"
and what the legal and penal systems ignore,

don't. Then it says that this is all you have to
know to judge their sanity."
The so-called "right-and-wrong" test he
describes is given to criminals to measure the
logic of their reasoning. Critics charge that it
unscientifically abstracts one mental process
— the cognitive — from the whole mental
make-up.
Lunde asserts that a man may be able to
reason logically from insane premises. For
example, Herbert Mullin reasoned coherently
and articulately that his murder of 10
individuals, or what he termed "minor
cataclysms," would forestall a major
cataclysm like an earthquake.
Kemper
In the case of Kemper, neither legal
definitions of insanity nor psychology
textbook descriptions of the mentally ill are
applicable. Lunde says, "We've even given him
a chromosone test for the XYY characteristic,
and a sodium amytal test — known as the
'truth serum.' I've interviewed him
extensively, but after seeing him for months, I
could not find anything that hung together."
His conclusions came after six months
spent researching Kemper's background. An
obsession with death and sexual fantasies
extends back to Kemper's early childhood.
"His ideas haven't changed much in 20 years,"
Lunde says.
"In the second or third grade, he used to

play 'the gas chamber game,'" Lunde
explains. His sister would pretend she was
turning on the gas, and he would writhe in
ecstacy on the floor. "He had a kind of ritual.
He was the one who wrote the script," Lunde
says.
Airtight Case
Despite evidence of psychological
abnormalities, Lunde explains he does not
have an airtight case establishing Kemper's
insanity along prescribed legal grounds.
Lunde's reluctance to take part in the
Kemper trial stems, in part, from fear that his
testimony could possibly be misconstrued to
corroborate the prosecution's stance. "This
would be the lowest blow of all," he says.
There are, in addition, other factors
muddying Kemper's trial, and Lunde would
like to keep clean. Psychiatrists, hired by both
the prosecution and the defense to battle out
the insanity issue, have reduced the
courtroom to "a theater of the absurd,"
Lunde asserts.
Prostitution
One veteran court officer has charged that
these psychiatrists are no better than
prostitutes selling out to the highest bidder.
Lunde deprecates those members of his
profession who make their living off the
court, and criticizes the legal system as well.
Central to the problem in court is the jury
which is usually not attuned to the delicate
problems in psychiatry. Lunde complains,
"You can't teach a jury a course in
psychology in two or three days, but that's
usually what you end up trying to do."

He suggests juries be composed of people
who "know something about the mentally ill
and know about alternatives that are
available." A panel of judges should hear and
rule on the testimony of psychiatrists, he says.
Scapegoat
Lunde's frustration with juries peaked
when a juror once confided after a trial that
he really thought the accused was insane, but
was afraid to vote accordingly out of fear that
psychiatrists would release the man.
Psychiatrists are often scapegoats for
delinquent parole boards, Lunde asserts. For
example, a widespread notion blames
psychiatrists for discharging Kemper from
Atascadero State Hospital, to which he was
committed for killing his grandparents when
he was 15. Lunde contends that a parole
board composed of 7 ex-policemen and a
retired dentist released him against
psychiatrists' recommendations.
Kemper became eligible for parole when he
turned 21 and left the jurisdiction of juvenile
court. Psychiatrists warned that if he were
ever parolled, he should be separated from his
mother, who seemed to arouse his aggression.
Instead. Kemper was discharged into his
mother's custody. 'The problem is that
nobody listens to psychiatrists," Lunde
complains.
Treatment
When the psychiatrist can help, his advice
goes unheeded, and in situations where he
feels unqualified to comment, "we are being
forced to deal with the issues," Lunde says.
The most perplexing problems deal with

the causes of psychological disorders and
predictions of their occurrence. "The larger,
more important question is just what's the
best thing to do with someone who is
admittedly dangerous but possibly treatable,"
Lunde says.
"Treatment is what most doctors are into,"
and what the legal and penal systems ignore,
Lunde contends. He compares mental illness
to three major causes of death in America —
heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. "Nobody
knows what causes them, and nobody can
predict them. The state of the two arts of
medicine and psychiatry are not that far
apart. Our function is to help the patient
function and feel better," Lunde says.
Ethical Problem
"What I am capable of addressing is how
Kemper and other patients like Kemper
should be treated. However, basically, this
advice is irrelevant to what they're asking in
court," Lunde explains.
Treatment is a controversial issue posing
tangled ethical problems for Lunde. "It's a
dangerous notion," he muses. "Is it right to
lock people up for the way they think?"
After much courtroom experience, Lunde
looks back on his first case, when at the
prompting of a personal friend, he evaluated a
defendant's mental condition. "He asked me
to do it just one time only," Lunde recalls. It
was a line that even a psychiatrist could fall
for, and now he's hooked trying to change a
system he thinks needs help, he says with a
laugh. 'That's a line you should learn to look
out for."
