# Relocation Proves Unnecessary
## Beutelsbach Offers Assets 
### 
Once again the question has
been raised whether or not the
Stanford-in-Germany campus
should be moved to a new
location, in West Berlin
specifically. One is led to believe
from the article (Daily, Oct. 17)
"Beutelsbach Campus May Be
Shifted" that such a move has
been prompted by economic
problems at the current
Beutelsbach campus due to first,
the devaluation of the U.S. dollar
and second, the extreme low
enrollment levels in the past two
summer-fall groups. Although
these two facts are perhaps
indications of difficulties for the
Stanford-in-Germany program,
they are by no means a logical
justification for such a move.
When viewed in the same
administrative manner, a Berlin
campus could not survive
economically any better than
Beutelsbach. First, the change in
location would require funds to
find comparable facilities in
Berlin. This would include costs
of transportation of the Overseas
Campus' administration to and
from Berlin, arrangement and
settlement of a new contract, plus
the cost of closing the current
Beutelsbach campus. Such
superfluous spending serves to
make the present "costly"
program only more "costly."
Should comparable facilities be
found in Berlin, it is highly
unlikely that they could possibly
be more economical than in
Beutelsbach. Berlin and every city
in Germany still suffers from
housing shortage. Rental rates in
all cities are noticeably higher
than in the surrounding suburban
areas. Unfortunately, in the case
of West Berlin, the surrounding
area in the GDR (East Germany)
does not offer any possibilities for
a new campus.
Geographic Drawbacks
More than economic
disadvantages, a campus in Berlin
would not be successful for
geographic reasons. A comparison
of the two German campuses in
Vienna and Beutelsbach
demonstrates this point. In
Vienna the failure of the campus
has been linked to many causes —
the undesirable "hotel"
accomodations; the absence of all
forms of recreation for the
students; and the lack of contact
between Vienna families and the
students. Stated simply, the
Vienna campus failed because of
its city-centered location.
The second German campus in
Beutelsbach presents a picture
strongly contrasting to that in
Vienna. On many occasions an
overwhelming majority of polled
students has favored Beutelsbach
over any urban alternative.
Compared to Vienna, the family
program in Beutelsbach remains
one of the strongest and most well
received programs at that campus.
As a matter of fact, there haven't
been enough students for the
available families. From the
record at both campuses one must
conclude that the Germany
program is enhanced by the
present non-urban Beutelsbach
location.
Isolated City
Geographically, West Berlin is a
walled-in city located in the midst
of the GDR, 200 km from the
remainder of FRG (West
Germanv) and 100 km from
Poland. As such, this unique city
could serve as an ideal center for
the study of contemporary
German international politics (the
well known Ostpolitik of the
Brandt government) as well as a
jumping off spot for travel
through these East Block
countries. However, the Vienna
campus, despite being the same
distance from Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia,
did not survive as a campus.

Clearly being in a strategic
locations is not enough to
guarantee the success of a Berlin
campus.
Concerining travel in the GDR
or other eastern countries,
experience here in Beutelsbach
has shown that few students
presently take advantage of their
opportunity to travel through
these countries following their
group field trip to Berlin.
Repeatedly less than 10 percent
of the students remain in Berlin,
travel in the GDR, or proceed on
to other countries in Eastern
Europe such as nearby Poland.
More popular seems a visit to
Hamburg, Copenhagen, or a cruise
on the Rhine.
I fear that once the novelty of
living in Berlin has faded most
students would remain trapped at
a Berlin campus separated from
the eastern countries by the time
consuming procedures of
obtaining the required advance
hotel reservations and visas and
cut off from the rest of the FRG
by the 200 km distance to the
west. What remains essentially
then is the prospect of living 6
months in West Berlin. And for
the same reasons that the urban
Vienna campus failed so would
such a Berlin campus.
Keep Present Location
If Beutelsbach has its problems
and Berlin its infeasabilities, does
an overseas campus in Germany
have any purpose at all? Very
definitely I say, and in particular,
exactly at the present location in
Beutelsbach. Based upon its
historical background each city
develops on its own as a cultural
center with its own musical and
theatrical programs, museums,
and individual atmosphere.
Stuttgart is a cultural center
serving the Land Baden-
Wuerttemberg as the capital.
This land has one of the oldest

Scott Morrison

unbroken traditions in all of
Germany dating from the 11th
century "von Beutelsbach" family
which later moved to Stuttgart
and became integrated into the
"Wuerttemberg" family. Based
upon this history within which a
student in Beutelsbach lives it
would be hard for me to think of
a better location for the Germany
campus than its current one.
Concerned about the same
problems at the Beutelsbach
campus, the current
Stanford-in-Germany faculty is
intensely involved in improving
the present program. Contacts
have been made with the
University in Stuttgart that
provide all future students the
opportunity to augment the
Beutelsbach program with study
in Stuttgart.
Positive Outlook
Furthermore, the outlook for
the enrollment at the Beutelsbach
campus in the coming year is very
positive. Currently for the winter
and spring quarters next year
there are 97 students registered
(far more than the 65 students
required to break even).
Following the closing of the
Vienna campus last summer one
can expect an increase of at least
100 percent of the current 30
students here; the extra students
being the ones who would have
gone to the competing campus in
Vienna. A hasty decision to
terminate the Beutelsbach campus
based purely upon false financial
considerations can all too easily
kill the present Germany program.
The correct decision to remain in
Beutelsbach has been left to the
students, but only if they act now
by expressing their opinions to
the misinformed Overseas
Campuses' Office.

"Wuerttemberg" family. Based
upon this history within which a
student in Beutelsbach lives it
would be hard for me to think of
a better location for the Germany
campus than its current one.
Concerned about the same
problems at the Beutelsbach
campus, the current
Stanford-in-Germany faculty is
intensely involved in improving
the present program. Contacts
have been made with the
University in Stuttgart that
provide all future students the
opportunity to augment the
Beutelsbach program with study
in Stuttgart.
Positive Outlook
Furthermore, the outlook for
the enrollment at the Beutelsbach
campus in the coming year is very
positive. Currently for the winter
and spring quarters next year
there are 97 students registered
(far more than the 65 students
required to break even).
Following the closing of the
Vienna campus last summer one
can expect an increase of at least
100 percent of the current 30
students here; the extra students
being the ones who would have
gone to the competing campus in
Vienna. A hasty decision to
terminate the Beutelsbach campus
based purely upon false financial
considerations can all too easily
kill the present Germany program.
The correct decision to remain in
Beutelsbach has been left to the
students, but only if they act now
by expressing their opinions to
the misinformed Overseas
Campuses' Office.

Once again the question has
been raised whether or not the
Stanford-in-Germany campus
should be moved to a new
location, in West Berlin
specifically. One is led to believe
from the article (Daily, Oct. 17)
"Beutelsbach Campus May Be
Shifted" that such a move has
been prompted by economic
problems at the current
Beutelsbach campus due to first,
the devaluation of the U.S. dollar
and second, the extreme low
enrollment levels in the past two
summer-fall groups. Although
these two facts are perhaps
indications of difficulties for the
Stanford-in-Germany program,
they are by no means a logical
justification for such a move.
When viewed in the same
administrative manner, a Berlin
campus could not survive
economically any better than
Beutelsbach. First, the change in
location would require funds to
find comparable facilities in
Berlin. This would include costs
of transportation of the Overseas
Campus' administration to and
from Berlin, arrangement and
settlement of a new contract, plus
the cost of closing the current
Beutelsbach campus. Such
superfluous spending serves to
make the present "costly"
program only more "costly."
Should comparable facilities be
found in Berlin, it is highly
unlikely that they could possibly
be more economical than in
Beutelsbach. Berlin and every city
in Germany still suffers from
housing shortage. Rental rates in
all cities are noticeably higher
than in the surrounding suburban
areas. Unfortunately, in the case
of West Berlin, the surrounding
area in the GDR (East Germany)
does not offer any possibilities for
a new campus.
Geographic Drawbacks
More than economic
disadvantages, a campus in Berlin
would not be successful for
geographic reasons. A comparison
of the two German campuses in
Vienna and Beutelsbach
demonstrates this point. In
Vienna the failure of the campus
has been linked to many causes —
the undesirable "hotel"
accomodations; the absence of all
forms of recreation for the
students; and the lack of contact
between Vienna families and the
students. Stated simply, the
Vienna campus failed because of
its city-centered location.
The second German campus in
Beutelsbach presents a picture
strongly contrasting to that in
Vienna. On many occasions an
overwhelming majority of polled
students has favored Beutelsbach
over any urban alternative.
Compared to Vienna, the family
program in Beutelsbach remains
one of the strongest and most well
received programs at that campus.
As a matter of fact, there haven't
been enough students for the
available families. From the
record at both campuses one must
conclude that the Germany
program is enhanced by the
present non-urban Beutelsbach
location.
Isolated City
Geographically, West Berlin is a
walled-in city located in the midst
of the GDR, 200 km from the
remainder of FRG (West
Germanv) and 100 km from
Poland. As such, this unique city
could serve as an ideal center for
the study of contemporary
German international politics (the
well known Ostpolitik of the
Brandt government) as well as a
jumping off spot for travel
through these East Block
countries. However, the Vienna
campus, despite being the same
distance from Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia,
did not survive as a campus.

Clearly being in a strategic
locations is not enough to
guarantee the success of a Berlin
campus.
Concerining travel in the GDR
or other eastern countries,
experience here in Beutelsbach
has shown that few students
presently take advantage of their
opportunity to travel through
these countries following their
group field trip to Berlin.
Repeatedly less than 10 percent
of the students remain in Berlin,
travel in the GDR, or proceed on
to other countries in Eastern
Europe such as nearby Poland.
More popular seems a visit to
Hamburg, Copenhagen, or a cruise
on the Rhine.
I fear that once the novelty of
living in Berlin has faded most
students would remain trapped at
a Berlin campus separated from
the eastern countries by the time
consuming procedures of
obtaining the required advance
hotel reservations and visas and
cut off from the rest of the FRG
by the 200 km distance to the
west. What remains essentially
then is the prospect of living 6
months in West Berlin. And for
the same reasons that the urban
Vienna campus failed so would
such a Berlin campus.
Keep Present Location
If Beutelsbach has its problems
and Berlin its infeasabilities, does
an overseas campus in Germany
have any purpose at all? Very
definitely I say, and in particular,
exactly at the present location in
Beutelsbach. Based upon its
historical background each city
develops on its own as a cultural
center with its own musical and
theatrical programs, museums,
and individual atmosphere.
Stuttgart is a cultural center
serving the Land Baden-
Wuerttemberg as the capital.
This land has one of the oldest

Germany dating from the 11th

group field trip to Berlin.
Repeatedly less than 10 percent
of the students remain in Berlin,
travel in the GDR, or proceed on
to other countries in Eastern
Europe such as nearby Poland.
More popular seems a visit to
Hamburg, Copenhagen, or a cruise
on the Rhine.
I fear that once the novelty of
living in Berlin has faded most
students would remain trapped at
a Berlin campus separated from
the eastern countries by the time
consuming procedures of
obtaining the required advance
hotel reservations and visas and
cut off from the rest of the FRG
by the 200 km distance to the
west. What remains essentially
then is the prospect of living 6
months in West Berlin. And for
the same reasons that the urban
Vienna campus failed so would
such a Berlin campus.
Keep Present Location
If Beutelsbach has its problems
and Berlin its infeasabilities, does
an overseas campus in Germany
have any purpose at all? Very
definitely I say, and in particular,
exactly at the present location in
Beutelsbach. Based upon its
historical background each city
develops on its own as a cultural
center with its own musical and
theatrical programs, museums,
and individual atmosphere.
Stuttgart is a cultural center
serving the Land Baden-
Wuerttemberg as the capital.
This land has one of the oldest

Scott Morrison

unbroken traditions in all of
Germany dating from the 11th
century "von Beutelsbach" family
which later moved to Stuttgart
and became integrated into the
"Wuerttemberg" family. Based
upon this history within which a
student in Beutelsbach lives it
would be hard for me to think of
a better location for the Germany
campus than its current one.
Concerned about the same
problems at the Beutelsbach
campus, the current
Stanford-in-Germany faculty is
intensely involved in improving
the present program. Contacts
have been made with the
University in Stuttgart that
provide all future students the
opportunity to augment the
Beutelsbach program with study
in Stuttgart.
Positive Outlook
Furthermore, the outlook for
the enrollment at the Beutelsbach
campus in the coming year is very
positive. Currently for the winter
and spring quarters next year
there are 97 students registered
(far more than the 65 students
required to break even).
Following the closing of the
Vienna campus last summer one
can expect an increase of at least
100 percent of the current 30
students here; the extra students
being the ones who would have
gone to the competing campus in
Vienna. A hasty decision to
terminate the Beutelsbach campus
based purely upon false financial
considerations can all too easily
kill the present Germany program.
The correct decision to remain in
Beutelsbach has been left to the
students, but only if they act now
by expressing their opinions to
the misinformed Overseas
Campuses' Office.

Stanford-in-Germany Group
XXX. He is currently a student at
the University in Stuttgart.)
Once again the question has
been raised whether or not the
Stanford-in-Germany campus
should be moved to a new
location, in West Berlin
specifically. One is led to believe
from the article (Daily, Oct. 17)
"Beutelsbach Campus May Be
Shifted" that such a move has
been prompted by economic
problems at the current
Beutelsbach campus due to first,
the devaluation of the U.S. dollar
and second, the extreme low
enrollment levels in the past two
summer-fall groups. Although
these two facts are perhaps
indications of difficulties for the
Stanford-in-Germany program,
they are by no means a logical
justification for such a move.
When viewed in the same
administrative manner, a Berlin
campus could not survive
economically any better than
Beutelsbach. First, the change in
location would require funds to
find comparable facilities in
Berlin. This would include costs
of transportation of the Overseas
Campus' administration to and
from Berlin, arrangement and
settlement of a new contract, plus
the cost of closing the current
Beutelsbach campus. Such
superfluous spending serves to
make the present "costly"
program only more "costly."
Should comparable facilities be
found in Berlin, it is highly
unlikely that they could possibly
be more economical than in
Beutelsbach. Berlin and every city
in Germany still suffers from
housing shortage. Rental rates in
all cities are noticeably higher
than in the surrounding suburban
areas. Unfortunately, in the case
of West Berlin, the surrounding
area in the GDR (East Germany)
does not offer any possibilities for
a new campus.
Geographic Drawbacks
More than economic
disadvantages, a campus in Berlin
would not be successful for
geographic reasons. A comparison
of the two German campuses in
Vienna and Beutelsbach
demonstrates this point. In
Vienna the failure of the campus
has been linked to many causes —
the undesirable "hotel"
accomodations; the absence of all
forms of recreation for the
students; and the lack of contact
between Vienna families and the
students. Stated simply, the
Vienna campus failed because of
its city-centered location.
The second German campus in
Beutelsbach presents a picture
strongly contrasting to that in
Vienna. On many occasions an
overwhelming majority of polled
students has favored Beutelsbach
over any urban alternative.
Compared to Vienna, the family
program in Beutelsbach remains
one of the strongest and most well
received programs at that campus.
As a matter of fact, there haven't
been enough students for the
available families. From the
record at both campuses one must
conclude that the Germany
program is enhanced by the
present non-urban Beutelsbach
location.
Isolated City
Geographically, West Berlin is a
walled-in city located in the midst
of the GDR, 200 km from the
remainder of FRG (West
Germanv) and 100 km from
Poland. As such, this unique city
could serve as an ideal center for
the study of contemporary
German international politics (the
well known Ostpolitik of the
Brandt government) as well as a
jumping off spot for travel
through these East Block
countries. However, the Vienna
campus, despite being the same
distance from Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia,
did not survive as a campus.

Clearly being in a strategic
locations is not enough to
guarantee the success of a Berlin
campus.
Concerining travel in the GDR
or other eastern countries,
experience here in Beutelsbach
has shown that few students
presently take advantage of their
opportunity to travel through
these countries following their
group field trip to Berlin.
Repeatedly less than 10 percent
of the students remain in Berlin,
travel in the GDR, or proceed on
to other countries in Eastern
Europe such as nearby Poland.
