# Africa Suffers Devastation
## Drought Victims Need Help 
### 
I would like to bring an urgent
matter to the attention of the
Stanford community.
For the past seven years, west,
east, central and some parts of
southern Africa have under-gone
one of the severest droughts the
world has ever seen. Highly
affected countries are: Mauritania,
Mali, Niger, Senegal, Upper Volta
and Chad.
Other countries also hit by the
severe drought are: Gambia,
Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast,
Ghana, Togo, Dahomey, Nigeria,
Central African Republic,
Cameron, Sudan, Ethiopia, Zaire
(Congo), Zambia, Rhodesia,
Botswana, Swaziland, South
Africa and Uganda.
Over all, 25 countries with over
three million square miles are now
under severe drought. The lack of
rain has brought devastation and
famine to over 30 million people.
The U.N. and the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) estimate
millions of people will die before
the famine is relieved.
Death From Draught
Already 1.5 million people are
dead, also millions of cattle,
sheep, goats, and other live-stock
are dead. Other means of survival,
e.g. crops are destroyed.
Lake Chad is characteristic of
the water shortage. It has been
reduced to one-fourth of its
normal size, and fish lie dead or
dying in the mud where water
once was. Elephants, lions, zebras,
deers, etc. can be seen stuck in
deep mud dead, in their attempts

to reach the drying up rivers and
lakes for drinks. Lake Chad has
dropped from 31,000 million
cubic meters in 1971 to 7,700
million cubic meters in 1972.
The rains are falling, however.
Total estimated rainfall is 59
percent. And if people are not too
weakened from seven years of
drought and famine, to work in
the fields, 40 percent harvest may
be possible next year. (40 percent
is a UN estimate.)
Consequences From Rain
In Upper Volta, for example,
rain has begun to fall in at least
some areas, and weakened people
rejoiced when the first showers
came. Navongo, in Ghana, has had
torrential rain. But the rain is
hampering transportation of relief
food and has not made it possible
to plant everywhere because many
of the farmers had left their
parched fields to seek food and
water in over crowded cities and
towns.
However, the rain is vitally
needed, it will fill dry wells, raise
the level of Lake Chad, River
Niger, River Volta, etc. from their
muddied state now to at least 75
percent of their former levels.
The use of the new water now
however is very dangerous â€”
cholera is already reported in
Upper Volta, and more is
expected if rains give people
access to polluted rivers and
pools. Malaria, measles and
common colds are other deadly
diseases killing both people and
cattle.
Action Essential
The situation warrants
immediate attention. I strongly
urge you to write your

Charles Ogletree

Congressmen demanding the U.S.
and the lu.N. to immediately
increase tneir economic aid to
these countries. We cannot remain
remote from this crisis. The fact
that millions of liyps have already
been taken as a result of
procrastination should forewarn
us of the urgency of the matter. A
large number of activities are
being planned at this University
and in the surrounding
communities.
If you can lend some time to
our fund drive, please contact
Charles Ogletree at the ASSU
office, x 4331 or Dave McCullum,
Faculty Club, x 4325. Urgency is
essential!
(Charles Ogletree is an ASSU Vice
President.)
