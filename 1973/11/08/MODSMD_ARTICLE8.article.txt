# Buried Alive In Books
## Midterm Fever Rises; Panic Abounds 
### 
Nothing could be as
perplexing, unnerving and utterly
anti-climactic as the brief, but
otherwise totally engrossing
activity unaffectionately referred
to as "the midterm."
When one is in secondary
school and the announcement is
made that a test is forthcoming, a
few isolated groans are heard and
everything continues as normal.
Alternatively, at Stanford, there is
nothing more awesome than the
professor's hand as it scratches
those words on the blackboard
that everyone hoped he'd forget:
FIRST MIDTERM - MONDAY
OCTOBER 29.
An eerie silence pervades the

room at this point. Suddenly, the
student, who has been so faithful
in attending class and doing his
burdensome yet somehow
rewarding homework assignments,
rips open his notebook, frantically
zips through the nonsensical
hieroglyphics that the prof has
been scribbling on the blackboard
for the past four weeks and turns
to whomever is sitting beside him
crying, "My God! How can he test
us on this?"
The following day finds the
poor scholar totally aghast in his
recitation group. The TA has tried
to be helpful by listing on the
board "those things with which
one should be familiar for the
exam." But instead of allaying our
student's fears, this has only
served to heighten them.
Suddenly, he realizes that the
bulk of the test is based on
notations he took as being casual
from the prof.
Automatic Student
A violent transition
immediately takes place in the
body of our friend. Where
studying used to be somewhat
chic and always self-initiated, it
was now becoming an integral
part of his normal bodily
functions.
He begins to do old homework
problems in his sleep just so he
won't get "rusty" during that
seven-hour period his mind would
otherwise be stagnating in
slumber.
He makes it a point to sit at
the dinner table where the topic
of conversation is not how hard
the rolls are, but instead, what the
mass of an electron is relative to
the size of an apple — or better
yet — the size of an apple relative
to the size of the earth. He tries
stretching his ear muscle, hoping
some of the profound knowledge
passing between the salt and

pepper will eventually find its way
into his brain.
Shattered Dreams
Then comes a brutal blow to
one of his favorite fantasies. He
happens to wander onto the third
floor of the Undergraduate
Library, presumably to study his
mind right out of its cranium,
when all of a sudden he spots his
RAthe —the one who made it a
point during orientation weekend
to remind all his freshman
appointees not to study too hard
and to "be sure and have F-U-N at
Stanford."
There sits this RA, nose firmly
implanted in a — perish the
thought — BOOK. The image has
been shattered! Sadly, he
concludes there is no room for
unadulterated hedonism at the
farm.
Sitting himself down, our
student develops new and exciting
meanings to the phrase "bury
one's head in a book." Negative
"X" hours of sleep the nights
previous have put him in a
virtually comatose state — ideal
for cramming.
Upon being awakened by his
paternalistic RA, he continues his
insurmountable task of translating
the ever-popular "Molecular
Screwdinger Equation" into the
English language — a job, I am
told, which can be accomplished
by your average computer in a
mere two hours.
Overwhelming Insanity
He begins to see dots forming
on the page — dots drawn by his
own, totally oblivious hand. A
fellow by the name of G.N. Lewis
made himself famous many years
ago by drawing similar dots on a
similar piece of paper.
The following days are filled
with much the same — that is,
until the morning of the midterm,
when our student discovers

Doug Witkins

himself sitting at a dilapidated
laboratory table with a chewed
pencil in one hand, a menacing
blue answer booklet in the other
and a song in his heart that has
here-since sunk to his shoes.
Time begins. Whipping out the
exam itself, he sets his revved-up
pencil in contact with the raceway
that is his answer booklet, shifts
his eyes to the first question and
immediately stalls the engine.
Dawning Discovery
He has horrifyingly noticed
that his high school security
blanket, the multiple choice
question, has been obliterated,
and all at once, he is naked and
totally defenseless against the
college phenomena known as the
blank space or "Yikes! There's
nothing to choose from!"
question.
Trying to thrust this sobering
thought from his mind, he once
again directs his attention to the
test itself. His hand skims the page
for those easy "Oh, I know how
to do this question..problems
— but finds none. In fact, it all
too soon becomes apparent that
he has studied all the wrong things
and all his pat definitions and
meaningless formulas will do
nothing to aid his passing the
examination.
Only one course of action
remains for our poor, unfortunate
student. He grasps hold of his
borrowed Texas Instruments
SR-10 Hand Calculator and in a
manner of which Captain Kirk
would be most proud, fires one
long, totally satisfying phaser ray
at the proctoring TA.
Ah, how sweet it is!

NOW, ON WITH THE INVESTIGATION . . .
Nothing could be as
perplexing, unnerving and utterly
anti-climactic as the brief, but
otherwise totally engrossing
activity unaffectionately referred
to as "the midterm."
When one is in secondary
school and the announcement is
made that a test is forthcoming, a
few isolated groans are heard and
everything continues as normal.
Alternatively, at Stanford, there is
nothing more awesome than the
professor's hand as it scratches
those words on the blackboard
that everyone hoped he'd forget:
FIRST MIDTERM - MONDAY
OCTOBER 29.
An eerie silence pervades the

room at this point. Suddenly, the
student, who has been so faithful
in attending class and doing his
burdensome yet somehow
rewarding homework assignments,
rips open his notebook, frantically
zips through the nonsensical
hieroglyphics that the prof has
been scribbling on the blackboard
for the past four weeks and turns
to whomever is sitting beside him
crying, "My God! How can he test
us on this?"
The following day finds the
poor scholar totally aghast in his
recitation group. The TA has tried
to be helpful by listing on the
board "those things with which
one should be familiar for the
exam." But instead of allaying our
student's fears, this has only
served to heighten them.
Suddenly, he realizes that the
bulk of the test is based on
notations he took as being casual
from the prof.
Automatic Student
A violent transition
immediately takes place in the
body of our friend. Where
studying used to be somewhat
chic and always self-initiated, it
was now becoming an integral
part of his normal bodily
functions.
He begins to do old homework
problems in his sleep just so he
won't get "rusty" during that
seven-hour period his mind would
otherwise be stagnating in
slumber.
He makes it a point to sit at
the dinner table where the topic
of conversation is not how hard
the rolls are, but instead, what the
mass of an electron is relative to
the size of an apple — or better
yet — the size of an apple relative
to the size of the earth. He tries
stretching his ear muscle, hoping
some of the profound knowledge
passing between the salt and

pepper will eventually find its way
into his brain.
Shattered Dreams
Then comes a brutal blow to
one of his favorite fantasies. He
happens to wander onto the third
floor of the Undergraduate
Library, presumably to study his
mind right out of its cranium,
when all of a sudden he spots his
RAthe —the one who made it a
point during orientation weekend
to remind all his freshman
appointees not to study too hard
and to "be sure and have F-U-N at
Stanford."
There sits this RA, nose firmly
implanted in a — perish the
thought — BOOK. The image has
been shattered! Sadly, he
concludes there is no room for
unadulterated hedonism at the
farm.
Sitting himself down, our
student develops new and exciting
meanings to the phrase "bury
one's head in a book." Negative
"X" hours of sleep the nights
previous have put him in a
virtually comatose state — ideal
for cramming.
Upon being awakened by his
paternalistic RA, he continues his
insurmountable task of translating
the ever-popular "Molecular
Screwdinger Equation" into the
English language — a job, I am
told, which can be accomplished
by your average computer in a
mere two hours.
Overwhelming Insanity
He begins to see dots forming
on the page — dots drawn by his
own, totally oblivious hand. A
fellow by the name of G.N. Lewis
made himself famous many years
ago by drawing similar dots on a
similar piece of paper.
The following days are filled
with much the same — that is,
until the morning of the midterm,
when our student discovers

Doug Witkins

himself sitting at a dilapidated
laboratory table with a chewed
pencil in one hand, a menacing
blue answer booklet in the other
and a song in his heart that has
here-since sunk to his shoes.
Time begins. Whipping out the
exam itself, he sets his revved-up
pencil in contact with the raceway
that is his answer booklet, shifts
his eyes to the first question and
immediately stalls the engine.

previous have put him in a
virtually comatose state — ideal
for cramming.
Upon being awakened by his
paternalistic RA, he continues his
insurmountable task of translating
the ever-popular "Molecular
Screwdinger Equation" into the
English language — a job, I am
told, which can be accomplished
by your average computer in a
mere two hours.
Overwhelming Insanity
He begins to see dots forming
on the page — dots drawn by his
own, totally oblivious hand. A
fellow by the name of G.N. Lewis
made himself famous many years
ago by drawing similar dots on a
similar piece of paper.
The following days are filled
with much the same — that is,
until the morning of the midterm,
when our student discovers

Doug Witkins

himself sitting at a dilapidated
laboratory table with a chewed
pencil in one hand, a menacing
blue answer booklet in the other
and a song in his heart that has
here-since sunk to his shoes.
Time begins. Whipping out the
exam itself, he sets his revved-up
pencil in contact with the raceway
that is his answer booklet, shifts
his eyes to the first question and
immediately stalls the engine.
Dawning Discovery
He has horrifyingly noticed
that his high school security
blanket, the multiple choice
question, has been obliterated,
and all at once, he is naked and
totally defenseless against the
college phenomena known as the
blank space or "Yikes! There's
nothing to choose from!"
question.
Trying to thrust this sobering
thought from his mind, he once
again directs his attention to the
test itself. His hand skims the page
for those easy "Oh, I know how
to do this question..problems
— but finds none. In fact, it all
too soon becomes apparent that
he has studied all the wrong things
and all his pat definitions and
meaningless formulas will do
nothing to aid his passing the
examination.
Only one course of action
remains for our poor, unfortunate
student. He grasps hold of his
borrowed Texas Instruments
SR-10 Hand Calculator and in a
manner of which Captain Kirk
would be most proud, fires one
long, totally satisfying phaser ray
at the proctoring TA.
Ah, how sweet it is!

NOW, ON WITH THE INVESTIGATION . . .
Nothing could be as
perplexing, unnerving and utterly
anti-climactic as the brief, but
otherwise totally engrossing
activity unaffectionately referred
to as "the midterm."
When one is in secondary
school and the announcement is
made that a test is forthcoming, a
few isolated groans are heard and
everything continues as normal.
Alternatively, at Stanford, there is
nothing more awesome than the
professor's hand as it scratches
those words on the blackboard
that everyone hoped he'd forget:
FIRST MIDTERM - MONDAY
OCTOBER 29.
An eerie silence pervades the

room at this point. Suddenly, the
student, who has been so faithful
in attending class and doing his
burdensome yet somehow
rewarding homework assignments,
rips open his notebook, frantically
zips through the nonsensical
hieroglyphics that the prof has
been scribbling on the blackboard
for the past four weeks and turns
to whomever is sitting beside him
crying, "My God! How can he test
us on this?"
The following day finds the
poor scholar totally aghast in his
recitation group. The TA has tried
to be helpful by listing on the
board "those things with which
one should be familiar for the
exam." But instead of allaying our
student's fears, this has only
served to heighten them.
Suddenly, he realizes that the
bulk of the test is based on
notations he took as being casual
from the prof.
Automatic Student
A violent transition
immediately takes place in the
body of our friend. Where
studying used to be somewhat
chic and always self-initiated, it
was now becoming an integral
part of his normal bodily
functions.
He begins to do old homework
problems in his sleep just so he
won't get "rusty" during that
seven-hour period his mind would
otherwise be stagnating in
slumber.
He makes it a point to sit at
the dinner table where the topic
of conversation is not how hard
the rolls are, but instead, what the
mass of an electron is relative to
the size of an apple — or better
yet — the size of an apple relative
to the size of the earth. He tries
stretching his ear muscle, hoping
some of the profound knowledge
passing between the salt and

pepper will eventually find its way
into his brain.
Shattered Dreams
Then comes a brutal blow to
one of his favorite fantasies. He
happens to wander onto the third
floor of the Undergraduate
Library, presumably to study his
mind right out of its cranium,
when all of a sudden he spots his
RAthe —the one who made it a
point during orientation weekend
to remind all his freshman
appointees not to study too hard
and to "be sure and have F-U-N at
Stanford."
There sits this RA, nose firmly
implanted in a — perish the
thought — BOOK. The image has
been shattered! Sadly, he
concludes there is no room for
unadulterated hedonism at the
farm.
Sitting himself down, our
student develops new and exciting
meanings to the phrase "bury
one's head in a book." Negative
