# Former Nixon Fans Show Less Support
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Last year's supporters of President
Nixon here are quietly critical of his
conduct today.
They aren't manning impeachment
tables or making speeches. In fact,
most are hesitant to support
impeachment efforts or calls for the
President's resignation.
But while many remain committed
to the Nixonian policies they stumped
for in the 1972 campaign, most say
they have "lost confidence" in the
Nixon Administration — and readily
agree that a full inquiry into the
President's conduct should be made.
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, whose
endorsement of Nixon appeared in a
Committee to Re-elect the President
advertisement in the New York Times
in 1972, and who made speeches to
Jewish groups on behalf of the
President's campaign, said he "would
have been a great deal less
enthusiastic" if he had known last year
what he knows now.
'Never The Same'
"The country would probably be
better off if the President had left
office," Friedenthal said. "Even if he
guts it out, it just never will be the
same.
"He's had this pugnacious, divisive
approach to the Presidency. I
understand that — I think he's fighting
back in the only way he can. But
that's precisely the problem. We don't
need divisiveness. We don't need more
attacks on the press . . .
Friedenthal emphasized that he was
never "a rabid supporter" of Nixon's
re-election. "I didn't support him in
1968," he said.
But Friedenthal was cautious about
impeachment and resignation. "If the
result of resignation or impeachment
would be a responsible, intelligent
person in the White House, who is not
tainted by all this, then I would
strongly support resignation or
impeachment. I do not feel that
Congressman Ford is a terribly strong
candidate for the office.
"I think [Nixon) will survive in
office — and be a very weak President

in a very weak time," Friedenthal
concluded.
Owen Might Stay Home
Asst. Economics Prof. Bruce Owen,
who worked for the President at the
White House Office of
Telecommunications Policy, said if the
1972 election were held today he
"might not vote at all."
"I'm still generally in favor of the
substantive policies of the

SECOND THOUGHTS — Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, who signed an ad in the
"New York Times" last year supporting President Nixon's re-election, has since
had second thoughts about the President's performance.
