many predecessors, wish is that
the poor/unintelligent would limit
their children in the way the
non-poor do, that is all.
Shockley's claims about race may
be controversial, but his claim
that there is a correlation between
high birth rate and low
intelligence is NOT controversial.
It is in a sense obvious; part of
what we mean by the word
"intelligence" by anybody's
definition, is the ability to count
menstrual days, use apparatus at
the right moment, and remember
to take pills regularly.
How, in the name of common
sense, can it be genocide to
advocate that the poor be
rewarded for doing what the
non-poor do anyway, without
reward and in their own interests,
namely, have no more than a
sensible number of children.
One may well not like what
Shockley says; one may even
believe, or rather hope, that what
he claims is false, but he never
talks nonsense. In matters like
their mindless overkill of
"genocide" his opponents often
do talk nonsense, and no cause is
well served by that.

Those of us who have
responsibility for the Stanford
Shopping Center share some of
the goals expressed in Jim
Francesconi's column of last
Friday. We too would like to
make the Center into a more
people-oriented place with a
greater variety of activity for all.
We also are mindful of the fact
that 25 percent of the Center's
net income goes to 337 student
financial aid accounts and 35
percent to 388 individual
instruction and research accounts.
That too involves a continuous
flow of people — people who each
year depend upon that income to
further their education and
knowledge, which is, after all,
what Stanford Unviersity is about.

Last December the University
staff took the initiative to present
to the public, not a proposal, but
rather some conceptual ideas
about the future of the Shopping
Center, and invited community
input before any plans were
developed. Since then, we have
not received one single idea or
suggestion in response to that
meeting for use in developing a
program for the Center.
Is People Planning for Stanford
laying back to play a game of
protest and confrontation — an
inhumane game which is wasteful
of human and financial resources
— or do they wish to work in a
spirit of cooperation to achieve
mutually desirable goals? If it is
the former, I feel sorry for them
and for the rest of the
community. If it is the latter, the
address is 105 Encina Hall and the
telephone extension is 2232.

I fully share Jennifer Randisi's
enthusiasm for Jamaican reggae,
one of the greatest forms of music
I have ever heard, but I am
puzzled by one remark in her
article on the Wailers. She states
that six members of that group
"are black and speak no English."
A few years ago I was in
Jamaica to visit the field research
area of a Jamaican graduate
student in geology here at
Stanford. Although we travelled
for several days through the
mountain villages and farmlands
of the interior, I cannot remember
meeting anyone who could "speak
no English." It took me a while to
catch on to the accent, and there
were some dialect variations that
baffled me, but it was my
impression that people were
speaking a local brand of English,
both to me and to themselves.
Can you find someone who can
clarify this point?

I fully share Jennifer Randisi's
enthusiasm for Jamaican reggae,
one of the greatest forms of music
I have ever heard, but I am
puzzled by one remark in her
article on the Wailers. She states
that six members of that group
"are black and speak no English."
A few years ago I was in
Jamaica to visit the field research
area of a Jamaican graduate
student in geology here at
Stanford. Although we travelled
for several days through the
mountain villages and farmlands
of the interior, I cannot remember
meeting anyone who could "speak
no English." It took me a while to
catch on to the accent, and there
were some dialect variations that
baffled me, but it was my
impression that people were
speaking a local brand of English,
both to me and to themselves.
Can you find someone who can
clarify this point?

many predecessors, wish is that
the poor/unintelligent would limit
their children in the way the
non-poor do, that is all.
Shockley's claims about race may
be controversial, but his claim
that there is a correlation between
high birth rate and low
intelligence is NOT controversial.
It is in a sense obvious; part of
what we mean by the word
"intelligence" by anybody's
definition, is the ability to count
menstrual days, use apparatus at
the right moment, and remember
to take pills regularly.
How, in the name of common
sense, can it be genocide to
advocate that the poor be
rewarded for doing what the
non-poor do anyway, without
reward and in their own interests,
namely, have no more than a
sensible number of children.
One may well not like what
Shockley says; one may even
believe, or rather hope, that what
he claims is false, but he never
talks nonsense. In matters like
their mindless overkill of
"genocide" his opponents often
do talk nonsense, and no cause is
well served by that.

Shopping Center Aids People
Editor:
Those of us who have
responsibility for the Stanford
Shopping Center share some of
the goals expressed in Jim
Francesconi's column of last
Friday. We too would like to
make the Center into a more
people-oriented place with a
greater variety of activity for all.
We also are mindful of the fact
that 25 percent of the Center's
net income goes to 337 student
financial aid accounts and 35
percent to 388 individual
instruction and research accounts.
That too involves a continuous
flow of people — people who each
year depend upon that income to
further their education and
knowledge, which is, after all,
what Stanford Unviersity is about.

Last December the University
staff took the initiative to present
to the public, not a proposal, but
rather some conceptual ideas
about the future of the Shopping
Center, and invited community
input before any plans were
developed. Since then, we have
not received one single idea or
suggestion in response to that
meeting for use in developing a
program for the Center.
Is People Planning for Stanford
laying back to play a game of
protest and confrontation — an
inhumane game which is wasteful
of human and financial resources
— or do they wish to work in a
spirit of cooperation to achieve
mutually desirable goals? If it is
the former, I feel sorry for them
and for the rest of the
community. If it is the latter, the
