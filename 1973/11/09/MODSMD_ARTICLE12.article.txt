# Indians Seek To Control Own Education Process
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
"What people failed to realize
was that Indians were never in
charge of our own programs,"
Virgil L. Kills Straight, Oglala
Sioux president of the Coalition
for Indian-Controlled School
Boards, said Wednesday night.
Kills Straight, who is also a
member of the Tribal Council on
the Pine Ridge Reservation and
one of the initiators of the
Wounded Knee take-over, spoke
to a group of about 60 people in
the lounge at Soto, the native
American theme house on
campus.
"The goal of the coalition is to
gain some control over the
educational process" of American
Indians, Kills Straight said. Two
and a half years ago, when school
boards on five reservations formed
the group, "Indians had a high
drop-out rate, a high rate of
illiteracy," he explained.
"People came out and studied
us. These studies went no place.
They found out that there was a
high rate of illiteracy relative to
the rest of the country," but
solved nothing.
Drop-Out Rate
"Now that [our own] people
are finally managing to control
the educational system, it seems
like there is a lower drop-out rate,
it seems like there are more
successes," said Kills Straight.
Kills Straight has served as
liaison between the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and the tribes and
has testified several times before
Congressional committees. "Many
of our recommendations have
become policy or part of
proposed laws," he said.
Referring to the incident at
Wounded Knee, Kills Straight
described "a struggle between a
traditionalist and one who is not a
traditionalist." As a member of
the Tribal Council trying to resist
government control of Indian
affairs, Kills Straight said he met
resistance from Dick Wilson, tribal
chairman at Pine Ridge.
Tribal Sovereignty
Wilson, who hadabsolutepower
over the tribe when the Council
was not in session, co-operated
with the government more than
Kills Straight would have liked.
"He proved to us that there is no
tribal sovereignty," explained
Kills Straight.
After impeachment
proceedings against Wilson failed,
Kills Straight and his supporters
asked Russel Means of the

American Indian Movement "to
help protect our tribal
government," Kills Straight said.
Wounded Knee became "a local
thing that turned into a national
affair."
"I am not a militant," Kills
Straight emphasized. "I guess I
was rooting for the Indians at
Wounded Knee."
The protest at Wounded Knee
was inter-tribal conflict, but
behind it was a government that
"decided not to do anything" in
spite of legislation intended to
improve Indian job opportunities
and education, Kills Straight
contended.
Although the Coalition for
Indian-Controlled School Boards
still lacks sympathy from
government, Kills Straight is

pleased with results so far. In two
and a half years, they and AIM
have gained 130 Indian-controlled
schools, including colleges which
award MA's and PhD's.
The changes which local
control has instituted concern
mostly community wants.
Parents, with the help of
professionals, now make the
policies instead of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs or parochial
organizations. Curriculum now
includes classes in native
American languages and culture as
well as state-required subjects.
"When I went to school there
was nothing," said Kills Straight,
who is 32. He described his first
BIA school, where he was not
allowed to speak Sioux although
he knew no English.

over the tribe when the Council
was not in session, co-operated
with the government more than
Kills Straight would have liked.
"He proved to us that there is no
tribal sovereignty," explained
Kills Straight.
After impeachment
proceedings against Wilson failed,
Kills Straight and his supporters
asked Russel Means of the

American Indian Movement "to
help protect our tribal
government," Kills Straight said.
Wounded Knee became "a local
thing that turned into a national
affair."
"I am not a militant," Kills
Straight emphasized. "I guess I
was rooting for the Indians at
Wounded Knee."
The protest at Wounded Knee
was inter-tribal conflict, but
behind it was a government that
"decided not to do anything" in
spite of legislation intended to
improve Indian job opportunities
and education, Kills Straight
contended.
Although the Coalition for
Indian-Controlled School Boards
still lacks sympathy from
government, Kills Straight is

pleased with results so far. In two
and a half years, they and AIM
have gained 130 Indian-controlled
schools, including colleges which
award MA's and PhD's.
The changes which local
control has instituted concern
mostly community wants.
Parents, with the help of
professionals, now make the
policies instead of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs or parochial
organizations. Curriculum now
includes classes in native
American languages and culture as
well as state-required subjects.
"When I went to school there
was nothing," said Kills Straight,
who is 32. He described his first
BIA school, where he was not
allowed to speak Sioux although
he knew no English.

SELF-DETERMINATION - Virgil L. Kills Straight, president of the
Coalition for Indian-Controlled School Boards, claimed that
self-management of education programs directed towards
Americans has lowered drop-out rates. Kills Straight, an Oglala Sioux,
addressed about 60 people in Soto Lounge Wednesday night.
"What people failed to realize
was that Indians were never in
charge of our own programs,"
Virgil L. Kills Straight, Oglala
Sioux president of the Coalition
for Indian-Controlled School
Boards, said Wednesday night.
Kills Straight, who is also a
member of the Tribal Council on
the Pine Ridge Reservation and
one of the initiators of the
Wounded Knee take-over, spoke
to a group of about 60 people in
the lounge at Soto, the native
American theme house on
campus.
"The goal of the coalition is to
gain some control over the
educational process" of American
Indians, Kills Straight said. Two
and a half years ago, when school
boards on five reservations formed
the group, "Indians had a high
drop-out rate, a high rate of
illiteracy," he explained.
"People came out and studied
us. These studies went no place.
They found out that there was a
high rate of illiteracy relative to
the rest of the country," but
solved nothing.
Drop-Out Rate
"Now that [our own] people
are finally managing to control
the educational system, it seems
like there is a lower drop-out rate,
it seems like there are more
successes," said Kills Straight.
Kills Straight has served as
liaison between the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and the tribes and
has testified several times before
Congressional committees. "Many
of our recommendations have
become policy or part of
proposed laws," he said.
Referring to the incident at
Wounded Knee, Kills Straight
described "a struggle between a
traditionalist and one who is not a
traditionalist." As a member of
the Tribal Council trying to resist
government control of Indian
affairs, Kills Straight said he met
resistance from Dick Wilson, tribal
chairman at Pine Ridge.
Tribal Sovereignty
Wilson, who hadabsolutepower
over the tribe when the Council
was not in session, co-operated
with the government more than
Kills Straight would have liked.
"He proved to us that there is no
tribal sovereignty," explained
Kills Straight.
After impeachment
proceedings against Wilson failed,
