# Reagan Still Strong For '76

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov.
Ronald Reagan's political prestige
may be dented, but observers of
both parties still consider him a
strong potential contender for the
White House in 1976.
The 62-year-old Republican
governor worked all year long to
win approval at the polls of a
complex constitutional
amendment to permanently limit
state taxes and spending.
The measure was rejected
54-46 percent in a special
statewide election Tuesday.
Political Plans
Reagan said Wednesday the
outcome will not affect his
political plans, but he declined to
speculate on the chance he will
seek the Republican presidential
nomination.
"The only future political
plans I have are the next 14
months here in California," said
Reagan, who plans to leave office
at the end of his second four-year
term.
He said again he plans to
embark on speaking tours after
leaving office in January of 1975.
Reagan said he might carry this
message to the rest of the nation
from Tuesday's election: "It
might be something to reveal to
people how difficult it is to halt
the growth of government, the
entrenched position that the
government establishment has."
"Political Defeat"
The governor, with his wife
Nancy looking on, did not call it a
personal political defeat. "How

can trying to reduce the people's
taxes be a political defeat?" he
said.
While he has suffered his
biggest political setback in
California, Democratic leaders
said they thought Reagan still
would be a major contender for
the GOP nomination.
The chief Democratic foe of
his tax plan, Assembly Speaker
Bob Moretti, said "he's still a
martyr to the right wing and
should do very well with that
element" at the 1976 Republican
National Convention.
'Strong Position'
One of Reagan's closest
advisers and financial supporters,
Los Angeles auto dealer Holmes
Tuttle, said, "The governor's
position nationally will be a
strong one.
"He still has proven his courage
and dedication to the belief that
government is too big," Tuttle
said.
Informed GOP sources say
Tuttle is the leader of serious

Reagan-for-President thinking but
he said, "That's too far away to
think about."
Reagan said he did not
consider the Watergate scandal a
factor in the outcome Tuesday.
Special Election
Forty-six percent of
California's nine million registered
voters went to the polls Tuesday
in the first special election of its
kind ever held in the state. The
Reagan tax plan was the only
issue on the statewide ballot.
Reagan fashioned his two
gubernatorial victories, in 1966
and 1970, by building up big
majorities in GOP strongholds;
cutting heavily into conservative
Democratic areas and winning the
big swing county, Los Angeles.
Tuesday, he won only 11 of
the state's 58 counties for Prop. 1
and lost Los Angeles County by
nearly 50,000 votes.
"My fellow Californians have
responded â€” some at the ballot
box, some by staying home,"
Reagan said.
