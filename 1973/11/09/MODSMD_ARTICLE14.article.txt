When will the new squash courts be open? Will you be able to
check out racquets? N.K.
The squash and handball courts will be opened for the first time on
Monday at 9 a.m. You'll have to bring your own equipment, though —
the Athletic Department will not be checking any out.

I'm interested in finding out if there is a bus service between
Berkeley and Stanford (direct, not Greyhound). Last spring an article
in the "Bug Me" column did refer to such a service — I want to know
if it still exists. B.S.
Robert Wrigley, head of the Peninsula Commuter Club, said that
the same bus service exists between Berkeley and Stanford as did last
year. To quote from "Bug Me," May 23,1973:
"(The bus) leaves Berkeley at 6:35 a.m. and arrives at Stanford at
7:45. The return trip begins at Stanford at 5:05 p.m., and ends in
Berkeley at 6:15.
"The bus stops in front of the Old Pavilion at Stanford, on the
corner of Serra and Galvez streets.
"It travels through Berkeley, making more than one stop. The bus
begins in north Berkeley, stopping first at the corner of Shattuck to
Hearst, and then cuts over to Oxford. It goes south on Oxford, which
eventually turns into Fulton. Then the bus turns east onto Ashby and
continues out to Highway 13.
"The price is $1.65 one way, or you can buy a package of tickets
good for rides Monday through Friday for $11.
"There are no special arrangements to be made in order to ride the
bus."
