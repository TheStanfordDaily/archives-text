The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.

The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.
—Jay Harlow
Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.
-J.H.
Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.

The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy

of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.

The opening guitar lick of "If

to the credits, looking for George

first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.
— Mark Simonian
The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.
—George Powell
The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.
—Keith Copeland
Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.
—Jay Harlow
Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.
-J.H.
Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy

of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.

Indeed, listening to all of the

The melodies, harmonies, chord

guitar sound of all of the songs are

Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.

Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.
— Mark Simonian
The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.
—George Powell
The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.
—Keith Copeland
Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.
—Jay Harlow
Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.

Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he

Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes

He's done his time; this is his sixth

He has a perfect voice for

a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of

trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.

Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.
-J.H.
Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.
—John Brad Crum
Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.
— Mark Simonian
The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.
—George Powell
The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.
—Keith Copeland
Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.

Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.

Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much

RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he

Nesmith is expert at making use

just the right level of

Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the

"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.
—Jay Harlow
Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.
-J.H.
Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.
— Mark Simonian
The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.
—George Powell
The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel

of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit

Indeed, listening to all of the

even though it has been nearly

The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm

Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The

addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better

"Side Tracked" sounds like a

He has a perfect voice for

The second is "Uncle Pen?' a

of peaceful rest in "Prairie

The first side of Pretty Much

make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his

"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness

the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout

the sensitive and understated

Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"

atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.

The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.
—George Powell
The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.
—Keith Copeland
Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.
—Jay Harlow
Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.
-J.H.
Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.

The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High

of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout

never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.
— Mark Simonian
The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.
—George Powell
The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.
—Keith Copeland
Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.
—Jay Harlow
Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.
-J.H.
Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.

Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High

of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.

appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.

Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
RCA APLI-0164
"Mike Nesmith . .. wasn't he
in the 'Monkees'?"
Well, yes, but it's about time
we forgave him for past mistakes
and crimes against rock music.
He's done his time; this is his sixth
album since the death of the first
pop-group created by Madison
Avenue for a television series.
Anyway, in retrospect the
"Monkees" don't seem like such a
crime against the public tastes
when you consider that in 1970 a
band of cartoon characters named
"The Archies" had the number
one single for the year on the
Billboard poll ("Sugar, Sugar").
Nesmith has tried in his solo
career to totally escape the stigma
of the "Monkees" and seek a
more discerning, hip audience. His
craving for "hip" acceptance is
very obvious in the title and the
graphics of his latest album,
Pretty Much Your Standard
Ranch Stash. The liner notes
inside also seemed a bit too
self-consciously heavy and
laid-back; it's as if they are trying
to paint the man as a sort of
"furry freak brother" with a
cowboy hat.
"Despite this element of
cuteness in his publicity (a
holdover from Monkee days)
Michael Nesmith is a fine musician
who stays remarkably true to the
country-western traditions upon
which his music is based. One
promotional poster called him "A
Cowboy for Today's America;"
pretentions, possibly, but
accurate.
Good Sidemen
Nesmith is primarily a cowboy
ballader who plays close attention
to the quality of his sidemen and
his arrangements. Several of the
men in his band are genuine
country stars. Red Rhodes, who
has played pedal steel for Nesmith
since his second album, is a Grand
Ole Opry veteran, named "best
steel guitar" by the Academy of
Country and Western Music in
1965 and 1967. The subtle

excellence of Rhodes' playing
makes for one of the most
obvious differences between
Nesmith's hand and lesser
country-rock groups.
Nesmith, who plays, acoustic
rhythm guitar himself, wrote the
four songs on side one and lent his
arranging talents to the
country-western classics on side
two. At first his arrangements
seem overly simple; there are
never too many instruments
playing at one time.
When he is singing this
becomes especially evident. There
are no other voices but Nesmith's
on the album, and he apparently
shuns such slick techniques as
double-voicing and overdubbing.
Nesmith is expert at making use
of the compelling quality of his
own voice by surrounding it with
just the right level of
accompaniment.
Perfect Country Voice
He has a perfect voice for
country ballads. It is sincere and
plaintive, high and clear, with just
a touch of huskiness and twang to
give it a cutting edge. The voice is
haunting, often touching.
In "A Prairie Lullabye," a song
written in the '30s by one of the
first nationally popular country
song writers, Billy Hill, Nesmith's
performance is full of warmth and
skill, but never lapses into
over-sentimentality. After the
introduction he flows naturally
into a superb example of cowboy
yodeling.
What is also striking about the
cut is the way Rhodes' steel
playing and David Barry's country
piano fit perfectly with the vocal
delivery. Rhodes is up in the
ozone with Nesmith, while Barry
keeps the song rooted to the
ground with his rhythmic
chording.
Country Trilogy
"Prairie Lullabye" is the final
cut on the second side, the last of
a series of three numbers which
Nesmith linked together in order
to produce a unique flow of
mood. The first song of the
trilogy is a spoken ballad about
the tragic death of a young
engineer on the "F.F.V."
The second is "Uncle Pen?' a
rousing bluegrass tune by Bill
Monroe. The fiddling and banjo
playing are the standouts in these
two songs. The exuberance of
"Uncle Pen" changes to a mood
of peaceful rest in "Prairie
Lullabye," which ends the trilogy
and the album.
The first side of Pretty Much
Your Standard Ranch Stash
demonstrates Nesmith's skill as
song-writer and lyricist. His songs
make often strikingly perceptive
comments about people who are
seeking a way out of loneliness.
The only problem with his
songwriting is a tendency towards
verbosity. Evidences of this

tendency can be seen in
"Continuing," but the emotional
honesty of the song saves it.
Luckily, Nesmith's songs and
arranging are free of the cuteness
that is found on the album cover;
the man seems determined to
remain "in character" throughout
all of his ballads. If this album is a
minor masterpiece it is due to a
unity of tone which extends from
the music, through the lyrics, to
the sensitive and understated
delivery of the vocals.
Even in "A Prairie Lullabye,"
when the temptation must have
been very strong to poke fun at
the sentimental old lyrics,
Nesmith sings it straight. Such a
nice old lullabye; it brings a very
fine album to rest.

Burns and Schreiber: Burns and
Schreiber's Pure 8.5.!" Little
David LD 1006
The new Burns and Schreiber's
Pure 8.5.! looks very promising
before you put it on the
turntable, but the album just
doesn't deliver.
Written and performed by the
veteran comedy team of Jack
Burns and Avery Schreiber, the
album on the outside seems to
offer uproarious comedy, some of
the same material that made their
ABC summer variety series a
winner in both popularity and
critical acclaim.
But the comedy on the inside
does not match the listener's
expectations. It seems trite,
overworked, simply not funny.
The humor does not fail
because it is uninspired (the
prospects of jokes about an
atomic hand grenade or giant
communist frogs are numerous),
but rather because the routines
themselves are poorly developed
for release on a record.
Visual Effects Missing
Burns and Schreiber's bits are
visual to a great extent. Their
album falls flat without the team's
unique facial put-ons and
characterizations.
Seeing Schreiber as a bored
New York cab driver listening to
Burns as a rambling, half-drunk
rider turns out to be much funnier
than just listening to the two of
them banter back and forth.
If nothing else, this album
proves that it is difficult for
performers to step out of the
medium they have proved
themselves in and step into
another medium. Burns and
Schreiber were fantastic on the
tube; their album is destined for
ignominy.

The Siegel-Schwall Band: 953 West
Wooden Nickel BWLI-0121
The Siegel-Schwall Band has
been cookin' around Chicago for
close to a decade now, doing an
urbanized, bluesy music that is
amazing only because Corky
Siegel and Jim Schwall are white
and not black.
Not only do Siegel and Schwall
play the urban blues, they write
them as well: on 953 West, all but
two of the tunes are composed by
the band's members.
The album is one that grows on
you with each listening, because
of the uncomplicated, crisp
instrumentation and the air of
whimsy that suffuses many of the
songs.
This whimsical touch is
particularly evident on "Traitor
from Decatur," about a woman
who gives more kisses to a dog she
found on the Outer Drive than she
does her man. Also "When I've
Been Drinkin'," a Big Bill
Broonzy tune, is a gem of
understatemnet about the
problems of good lovin' while
under the influence of alcohol.
Ample Talents
But other blues rockers like
"I'd Like to Spend Some Time
Alone Tonight With You My
Friend," "Old Time Shimmy,"
and"I Think It Was the Wine,"
showcase the band's ample music
talents.
Either Siegel or Schwall is
responsible for the vocals on most
of the songs. Siegel also plays a
fine blues piano and harmonica,
Schwall handles guitar, and
Rollow Radford chugs along on
bass. Drums and percussions are
well taken care of by Sheldon
Plotkin.
In combination, they make
953 West one of the most
easy-listening, likeable, urban
blues album's in quite a while.

The Main Ingredient's
The Main Ingredient's Greatest
Hits
RCA-APLI-0314
The Main Ingredient has done
it again! The Ingredient's latest
release entitled, The Main
Ingredient's Greatest Hits is by far
one of the best, if not the best,
album to date.
The album features the late
Donald McPherson on all of side
one and "Make It With You" on
side two. McPherson's unequalled
performance in "You've Been My
Inspiration," "Spinnning
Around," "I'm So Proud" and
"I'm Better Off Without You"
may possibly be the best epitaph
to the "main man" of the Main
Ingredient.
Cuba Gooding, McPherson's
replacement as lead singer, does
an excellent job, as shown by the
top-of-the-charts, "Everybody
Plays the Fool." However, in the

opinion of this reviewer he does
not equal the performance of
McPherson where it counts, in the
slow, warm, intimate type of
melody that has made the
Ingredient famous. His voice does,
however, bear a striking
resemblance to that of McPherson
which is good for our not too
discriminating listener.
All in all, Greatest Hits is an
excellent album, even topping my
favorite Tasteful Soul. It should
have no trouble making it to the
top of the charts, and probably a
Gold Album.
—Keith Copeland
Chris Jagger
Asylum SD 5069
Little brother Chris has finally
decided that he wants to be a
rock-'n-roll singer like the
immensely more famous Mick.
So there he was, in London,
just after coming back from India
and Israel. He was looking after
Mick's country estate, where the
Rolling Stones' mobile recording
studio, the Stonesmobile, just
happened to be parked.
So, according to the publicity,
he got some friends together and
with the help of some Rolling
Stone regulars, including brother
Mick on one track, the album
resulted.
Like His Brother
Not only does Chris look a bit
like Mick, he writes and sings a bit
like him, too. Although Chris's
lyrics are at times banal, the
album rocks more than the
Stone's latest (Goat's Head Soup),
and is not at all unpleasant to
listen to.
"Handful of Dust," "Let Me
Down Easy," and "Something
New," are good solid rockers,
although, like most of the album,
they suffer a bit from mediocre
lyrics.
If Chris really wants to pursue
his new vocation, this first album
does show some promise. But he
still has a long way to go.

Stomu Yamash'ta's
Red Buddha Theatre
Island SMAS-9334
The best way to describe this
remarkable record to American
audiences would be to compare it
to something Frank Zappa might
have thought of
This album is actually the
music from the Red Buddha
Theatre's presentation, "The Man
From the East," which was
written and directed by
Yamash'ta.
On the sound track, Yamash'ta
also plays almost every variety of
percussion instrument known to
Eastern and Western music. The
effect of his music is almost
impossible to assess without
seeing the stage production, which
was performed briefly in San

Francisco in the first week of
October.
Eclectic Show
This album is enough to make
one want to see the show, which
draws its sounds from kabuki,
traditional Japanese music and
Western pop and rock.
As an album, when the music is
interesting it is excellent, but it
sometimes drags and becomes dull
and incomprehensible.
The best cut (for movement) is
"What a Way To Live In Modern
Times," which combines some
"Freak Out-ish" chanting with
jazz, rock and traditional music to
make a very satisfying and unique
musical experience.
At 13 minutes "Mandala"
becomes too long and repetitious,
but "Memory of Hiroshima" is a
movement of eerie, haunting
beauty, which starts with a single
drone and builds to a very
expressive rock instrumental, and
then fades back to the spooky
drone.
The Red Buddha Theatre is not
in anyone's bag or mainstream, so
if you're feeling experimental this
album will definitely give you a
new listening experience.

Loggins & Messina: Full Sail
Columbia KC 32540
Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina seem to be a combination
that can do no wrong. Their
newest album, Full Sail, shows all
the same strengths as their first
two gold records, Sittin' In and
Loggins & Messina.
Their easygoing harmonies and
general comfortable feeling
highlight many of the songs on
this album, especially "A Love
Song" and "Sailin' the Wind," a
nice song about kite flying.
The latter song is also the best
showpiece of Jim Messina's guitar
work, which is always at least
competent.
Calypso Influence
Following the success of
"Vahevala" from Sittin' In, the
band has added a calypso feel to
several of the numbers. One rather
strange result of this is "Lahaina,"
a sort of Hawaiian-Caribbean
synthesis.
And, of course, there is good
old rock and roll. "My Music
shows the same enthusiasm in this
area as "Your Mama Don't
Dance" from the second album.
As before, Loggins and Messina
are backed by a very able band.
Larry Sims on bass, Michael
Omartian on keyboards, iuerei
Bregante on drums, and A 1 Garth
and Jon Clarke on everything else
imaginable provide an excellent
complement to the two singer
guitarists. One particularly good
instrumental moment is a
sax-to-harmonica solo transition
in "Pathway to Glory."
If you like the first two

Loggins and Messina albums, you
will probably like Full Sail. At
least some things remain constant.
—Jay Harlow
Traffic: On the Road
Island SMAS-9336
There are two ways to make a
live album: you can cover a
concert or tour which features old
numbers, current hits, and
previously unreleased material,
like the Dead's Europe '72\ or,
you can record three or four of
the group's recent hits in
extended live versions. On the
Road represents the latter
approach.
Traffic is unquestionably or
of the most popular draws on the
rock concert circuit. Part of the
reason is their long improvisations
on most numbers, with solos
passed around freely.
On the Road features 15
minutes of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," seven minutes of
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory," 10 minutes of "(I Feel
So) Uninspired" and 11 minutes
of "Light Up or Leave Me Alone."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Extended Versions
All of the numbers are
extensions of their studio album
cuts, with room for all of the so
loists to stretch out. The tempos
of the songs usually start a bit
slower, often building to a more
intense finish.
On the Road is a good album
to have if you don't have the last
two Traffic releases, for it features
four of the best tunes from those
albums. Unless you are a devout
Traffic freak, and want to hear
every possible version of every
song, owning all three seems a bit
redundant.
—J.H.
Dave Mason:
It's Like You Never Left
Columbia KC 31721
Speaking of Traffic, one of its
most famous veterans has just put
out another solo album. Dave
Mason's newest is called It's Like
You Never Left, a title which is
appropriate to at least half of the
album.
The opening chords of "Baby
... Please" mark it as a Mason
song to anyone who has heard his
work before.
Indeed, listening to all of the
first side, it's like he never left,
even though it has been nearly
two years since his last release.
The melodies, harmonies, chord
patterns, and acoustic rhythm
guitar sound of all of the songs are
strangely reminiscent of the Dave
Mason albums of the past.
Good Backup
The opening guitar lick of "If
You've Got Love" send me back
to the credits, looking for George
Harrison. He wasn't there, but
Graham Nash on backup vocals

and Stevie Wonder on harmonica
were. The harp work on "The
Lonely One" is an excellent
addition.
Side two was somewhat more
original in material and sound.
"Silent Partner" has a slight
Caribbean feel, and the title track
features a female chorus which
the song would have been better
off without.
"Side Tracked" sounds like a
filler. It is the only instrumental
on the album, and begins with a
fadein, ending with a fadeout. The
song consists of a bass-rhythm riff
with various guitar leads on top,
some of which are quite
creditable.

Michael Nesmith: Pretty Much
