# Warmth Pervades Brecht's 'Puntila'
## 
### SHERIDAN CRAWFORD 
Like vintage wine, Bertol-Brecht's Puntila
and His Hired Man (now playing in the Little
Theatre, directed by John Chioles), is a
full-bodied production, rich in the language
and local color of Finland. As it progresses,
the warmth of the players, each portrayed
vividly with a mature realization of human
character, gradually pervades stage, audience,
atmosphere.
At the curtain, with the whole cast
reassembled on stage, the full array of human
comedy, triumph, and contradiction swallows
the audience and the moment, giving that
brief glimpse of something vital, something
alive, which good dramatic theatre can create.
Fantastic performances were handed out all
around and for the crowd of energy and
conflict to remain on stage, everyone
functioning together, at once, was a
cooperative feat. Eric Booth Miller as Puntila
the drunk and human and as Puntila the sober
and vile landowner swells to great
proportions. He rants, raves, staggers, sputters,
rejoices; yet Miller maintains a solid base
underfoot.
He goes to the brink but never allows
himself to be sucked in by the extremities of
Puntila's behavior, nor does he allow the
certain madness of Puntila to take over the
acting for him. Miller can retreat if need be, in
order to allow others to come forward. Or he
becomes the blazing center of energy which
he sustains in a remarkable wet heat.

The first scene opens in song, then goes to
Puntila in the midst of a three day drinking
binge. The audience is immediately plunged
into the inebriated side of Puntila's double
life; his friend, the Judge (Peter Moore) has
passed out, slobbering, on the floor.
Meanwhile Puntila laments that he should ever
become sober again, when, as he says, "I'm
ever responsible!"
Joseph Siravo as Matti, Puntila's chauffeur,
appears in this first scene proud, even
arrogant, and stiff in juxtaposition to Puntila's
slouch. One waits throughout the play to see
Matti's rigid stance cracked, that his head may
roll back on his shoulders, that his mouth
might fall open releasing a great laugh.
When he is finally reached by Puntila's wild
imagination in the play's magnificant
mountain climbing scene, Siravo becomes at
once more believable, though he seemed
uncomfortable and not as sure of his character
as Miller.
Strengthened Part
Cristine Rose, as Puntila's daughter Eva,
brought her great range of powers to bear,
transforming the stage by her presence. She
developed the part, which could go under the
foot of either Puntila or Matti, to one which
met them full strength. Rose lets her hair
fly loose and wild in the fantastic banquet
scene when she calls for the chauffeur to
marry her while Puntila cheers affirmatively.
She meets her match by being put to the
wife-tftst by Matti, but not before a portion of

her suppressed rage at him is vented.
Eva fails because she does not know the
ritual of peasant life; she is too refined. The
differences in life style shaped by the
respective political realities of Matti and Eva
cannot be reconciled in order to marry.
The theme of irreconcilable differences
among men and among men and women is
carried throughout the play.
In the end, the strivings for unity must
remain brief gestures, strong but temporary.
The political statement at the end is weak in
comparison with the previous, widely human
scenes. Still, the raised first does have some
impact.
Perfect Mannerisms
A marvelous characterization was rendered
by Michael Hackett as the attache-suitor for
Eva's hand. His affected mannerisms — hand
on hip, hip swayed left or right, the eyes
rolling back, his talk of scandal — are perfect
and hilarious. He seemed to be the only one
able to completely redirect the focus from
Puntila onto himself and his antics.
The Four Fiancees played by Catherine
Owne, Judy Barnett, Elizabeth James, and
Randy Milden, are each rounded, open, and
fresh. Very good performances were also given
by Debra Notarangelo as Laina (strong
resonant singing voice) and Cathy LeGrand as
Fina.
All in all, "Puntila" is worth seeing, feeling,
joining in the laughter.

marry her while Puntila cheers affirmatively.
She meets her match by being put to the
wife-tftst by Matti, but not before a portion of

her suppressed rage at him is vented.
Eva fails because she does not know the
ritual of peasant life; she is too refined. The
differences in life style shaped by the
respective political realities of Matti and Eva
cannot be reconciled in order to marry.
The theme of irreconcilable differences
among men and among men and women is
carried throughout the play.
In the end, the strivings for unity must
remain brief gestures, strong but temporary.
The political statement at the end is weak in
comparison with the previous, widely human
scenes. Still, the raised first does have some
impact.
Perfect Mannerisms
A marvelous characterization was rendered
by Michael Hackett as the attache-suitor for
Eva's hand. His affected mannerisms — hand
on hip, hip swayed left or right, the eyes
rolling back, his talk of scandal — are perfect
and hilarious. He seemed to be the only one
able to completely redirect the focus from
Puntila onto himself and his antics.
The Four Fiancees played by Catherine
Owne, Judy Barnett, Elizabeth James, and
Randy Milden, are each rounded, open, and
fresh. Very good performances were also given
by Debra Notarangelo as Laina (strong
resonant singing voice) and Cathy LeGrand as
Fina.
All in all, "Puntila" is worth seeing, feeling,
joining in the laughter.
Like vintage wine, Bertol-Brecht's Puntila
and His Hired Man (now playing in the Little
Theatre, directed by John Chioles), is a
full-bodied production, rich in the language
and local color of Finland. As it progresses,
the warmth of the players, each portrayed
vividly with a mature realization of human
character, gradually pervades stage, audience,
atmosphere.
At the curtain, with the whole cast
reassembled on stage, the full array of human
comedy, triumph, and contradiction swallows
the audience and the moment, giving that
brief glimpse of something vital, something
alive, which good dramatic theatre can create.
Fantastic performances were handed out all
around and for the crowd of energy and
conflict to remain on stage, everyone
functioning together, at once, was a
cooperative feat. Eric Booth Miller as Puntila
the drunk and human and as Puntila the sober
and vile landowner swells to great
proportions. He rants, raves, staggers, sputters,
rejoices; yet Miller maintains a solid base
underfoot.
He goes to the brink but never allows
himself to be sucked in by the extremities of
Puntila's behavior, nor does he allow the
certain madness of Puntila to take over the
acting for him. Miller can retreat if need be, in
order to allow others to come forward. Or he
becomes the blazing center of energy which
he sustains in a remarkable wet heat.

The first scene opens in song, then goes to
Puntila in the midst of a three day drinking
binge. The audience is immediately plunged
into the inebriated side of Puntila's double
life; his friend, the Judge (Peter Moore) has
passed out, slobbering, on the floor.
Meanwhile Puntila laments that he should ever
become sober again, when, as he says, "I'm
ever responsible!"
Joseph Siravo as Matti, Puntila's chauffeur,
appears in this first scene proud, even
arrogant, and stiff in juxtaposition to Puntila's
slouch. One waits throughout the play to see
Matti's rigid stance cracked, that his head may
roll back on his shoulders, that his mouth
might fall open releasing a great laugh.
When he is finally reached by Puntila's wild
imagination in the play's magnificant
mountain climbing scene, Siravo becomes at
once more believable, though he seemed
uncomfortable and not as sure of his character
as Miller.
Strengthened Part
Cristine Rose, as Puntila's daughter Eva,
brought her great range of powers to bear,
transforming the stage by her presence. She
developed the part, which could go under the
foot of either Puntila or Matti, to one which
met them full strength. Rose lets her hair
fly loose and wild in the fantastic banquet
scene when she calls for the chauffeur to
marry her while Puntila cheers affirmatively.
She meets her match by being put to the
wife-tftst by Matti, but not before a portion of

her suppressed rage at him is vented.
Eva fails because she does not know the
ritual of peasant life; she is too refined. The
differences in life style shaped by the
