# 'Best In A Long Time'
## Ashkenazy Gives Excellent Concert 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
TherS s lan old adage that no
concert is all good or all bad. Last
Monday night in the Masonic
Auditorium, Vladimir Ashkenazy
practically defied that adage.
Ashkenazy has always piayed
brilliantly, but his recent concert
came close to perfection. He did
not play the piano; he made love
to it.
The concert opened with
Beethoven's Sonata in C Minor,
op. 10 no. 1. The piece lends itself
to over-romanticizing. Yet,
although Askkenazy interpreted it
freely, he stayed outside the
bounds of schmaltz.
He started out a little drily. His
first rendering of the exposition
was technically and dynamically
perfect, but a little cold. In his
repeat, however, he added
whatever feeling he had left out
the first time around.
Adds Variety
Actually, the differing
interpretations added variety to

the section; it is possible that two
heavily romanticized expositions
would have been too much for the
audience to handle.
Ashkenazy's technique was
practically flawless throughout.
His runs were clear, his turns
concise. He avoided overpedalling,
one of his usual faults. He played
with the dynamics, but it was
plain that he knew exactly what
he wanted to do.
The second movement gave
him the most room to play. He
abandoned tempo for flow. The
listener could not feel the meter
in a passage — only its flow
forward.
Loving Interpretation
Ashkenazy lingered lovingly on
the top notes of the first theme.
All his treble notes rang out softly
but clearly. He played with the
turns, slowing some of them down
and speeding some up, to leave
the audience waiting expectantly
or to sweep it up in the flow of
the music.
The only real fault in the piece
came in the third movement.
Ashkenazy built up the proud
theme toward the end; then, he
threw away the final chords. He
left the audience hanging
uncomfortably.
The next group consisted of
Chopin's Fantasie in F Minor, op.
49, his Ballade in F minor, op. 52,
no. 4, and his Scherzo in H major,
op. 54 no. 4. Chopin is one of
Ashkenazy's specialties. In this
concert, the pianist showed why.
Dynamic Delicacies
Ashkenazy captured the tragic
tone of the Fantaisie. The
performance was not as
technically perfect as was the
Beethoven, but, with the aid of
myriad interlocking melody lines
and heavier pedalling, it did not
have to be.
Ashkenazy brought out
dynamic delicacies. A mezzo
piano in one measure would differ
very slightly, but perceptibly,
from that in the next. He timed
his rubatoes and his pauses
instinctively.
Tempi varied from section to
section far more than in the
original score. Ashkenazy slowed
down so much in the middle
section, with its peaceful chords,
that he almost dragged; but his
tone kept the section alive. Then
he burst into tulmutous arpeggios,
where he unleashed all the energy

he had stored up in the slower
part.
The high point of the evening
was the Ballade, a piece which
invites emotion-packed
interpretations. Ashkenazy played
it better than this reviewer has
ever heard it done — either live or
on record. He played with the
melodies. He brought out all the
melodic lines and weaved them
into a beautiful pattern.
He stroked the keys to achieve
a soft but moving tone. He milked
the Ballade for every piece of
romanticism in it and left the
audience dazed.
The final selection in the
Chopin group was the Scherzo. In
this, Ashkenazy seemed unsure of
himself and ran into dynamic
problems. Several times, he
crescendoed too soon, so that his
final climaxes lost their punch. He
overflowed — from one section
into another unrelated one,
without any breath.
Slight Disappointment
This was the only piece in
which he missed a few crucial
notes, especially in the showy
chord passage at the end. In
general, however, he ably
controlled the softer, more subtle
dynamic passages. The notes in his
arpeggios and his two-handed trills
rang out, without harshness. For
anyone else, it would have been a
brilliant performance. For
Ashkenazy, it fell short of the
standard he set for himself in the
other pieces.
The second half of the program
consisted of ten preludes by
Rachmaninoff, from op. 23 and
32. Ashkenazy performed each
selection excellently.
Occasionally, his downward
arpeggios sounded a little messy,
or he missed an inside note in a
chord. On the whole, however, he
played perceptively and skillfully.
Several of the preludes deserve

special mention. The second one
he played, op. 32 no. 5 in G
major, stood out. Ashkenazy
achieved a feathery quality in the
tenor voice under a clear melodic
top line.
Here, his flow technique
worked consumately. The solitary
top line dissolved into broken
light chords. Ashkenazy sounded
as if he were grazing the keys, not
hitting them. And he brought the
audience up in the flow.
'Typically' Russian Piece
The fourth prelude, op. 23 no. 5
in G minor, was simultaneously
the best and worst in the group,
the theme is "typically" Russian,
and Ashkenazy played it with
sensitivity. Unfortunately, some
of the chords in the dotted
rhythm, march areas sounded
sour. He hit some of the last big
chords wrong, bringing in some
extraneous notes.
The concert ended with op. 32
no 13 in D flat major. This work
is not as much of a crowd pleaser
as a pianist might want for his
final number. The chords are
impressive, but the last two pages
are filled with so many cadences
that the listener is relieved when
the piece really ends.
Much to the audience's delight,
Ashkenazy performed Chopin's
Etude, op. 25 no 11 in A minor,
as an encore. This etude, known
as the "Winter Wind," made up
for the ending not delivered by
the Rachmaninoff. Ashkenazy put
all his power into the tempestuous
bass and all his technique into the
blustery treble chromatic
passages. The piece earned him a
standing ovation.
The concert was the best the
Bay Area has seen in a long time.
The mistakes are all minor, and
the excellence of the overall
performance far outweighed
them.
