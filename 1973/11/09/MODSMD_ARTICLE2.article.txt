# Nixon Seeks Energy Legislation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon formally asked Congress
yesterday to blend his emergency
energy - proposals into pending
legislation and to give him standby
authority to impose fuel and gasoline
rationing.
The five-page message sent to
Capitol Hill late yesterday followed up
on his televised report to the nation
Wednesday night on how his
administration tends to cope with the
energy shortages.
"The energy crisis that once seemed
a distant threat to many people is now
closing upon us quickly," Nixon told
Congress. Because of the Middle East
war, he said, "we must face up to the
stark fact" that petroleum supplies
could fall as much as 17 percent short
of demand this winter."
Nixon announced Wednesday night
the listed steps he wants included in
legislation now before Congress.
They include authorization to cut
government and industry business
hours, reduce highway speed limits to
50 miles per hour, temporarily relax
antipollution laws, adjust air and other
transportation schedules, allow nuclear
power plants to operate for 18 months
without public hearings on license
applications, permit year-around
Daylight Saving Time and authorize
full production from government oil
reserves.
In addition, Nixon asked for
congressional enactment before

December of standby authority to
allocate and ration energy supplies.
"It is my hope that rationing of
energy products will never be
required," Nixon said, "but if
circumstances dictate it, there should
be no impediment to swift action."
Meanwhile, in a room blazing with
television lights, the Nixon
administration's top energy officials
began working with the Senate today
on the emergency energy legislation
requested by the President.
Love Testifies
The first witness, White House
energy adviser John A. Love, made it
clear that the President is asking for
more authority than Chairman Henry
M. Jackson of the Senate Interior
Committee may be willing to grant.
Love asked the committee to
amend the Emergency Petroleum Act
authored by Jackson, D-Wash., to
allow the President to deregulate
natural gas at the well head and grant
more far-reaching waivers from the
emission requirements of air quality
standards.
Jackson, who Wednesday night
predicted the committee would
approve a bill today, replied, "I don't
believe in this emergency legislation.
We can start dealing with the whole
problem of gas, including
deregulation."
Train Concurs
Russell E. Train, head of the
Environmental Protection Agency,

seconded Love's request for authority
to waive so-called primary air
standards designed to protect public
health and safety. The waiver would
be needed to permit the burning of
d : rtier fuels, Train indicated.
Jackson's bill specifically prohibits
granting any variances in emission
requirements that would violate the
primary standards.
Thermostats Lower
Around the nation thermostats
were lower in homes and public
buildings yesterday as private citizens
and government officials alike sought
ways to implement President Nixon's
suggestions for conserving energy.
State and local officials were quick
to instruct drivers of
government-owned vehicles not to
drive faster than 50 miles per hour,
but most foresaw little chance that
speed limits for private cars could be
reduced without federal action.
The more popular projects to
reduce gasoline consumption involved
attempts to form car pools and
government promises to begin shifting
to smaller cars.

suggestions for conserving energy.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon formally asked Congress
yesterday to blend his emergency
energy - proposals into pending
legislation and to give him standby
authority to impose fuel and gasoline
rationing.
The five-page message sent to
Capitol Hill late yesterday followed up
on his televised report to the nation
Wednesday night on how his
administration tends to cope with the
energy shortages.
"The energy crisis that once seemed
a distant threat to many people is now
closing upon us quickly," Nixon told
Congress. Because of the Middle East
war, he said, "we must face up to the
stark fact" that petroleum supplies
could fall as much as 17 percent short
of demand this winter."
Nixon announced Wednesday night
the listed steps he wants included in
legislation now before Congress.
They include authorization to cut
government and industry business
hours, reduce highway speed limits to
50 miles per hour, temporarily relax
antipollution laws, adjust air and other
transportation schedules, allow nuclear
power plants to operate for 18 months
without public hearings on license
applications, permit year-around
Daylight Saving Time and authorize
full production from government oil
reserves.
In addition, Nixon asked for
congressional enactment before

December of standby authority to
allocate and ration energy supplies.
"It is my hope that rationing of
energy products will never be
required," Nixon said, "but if
circumstances dictate it, there should
be no impediment to swift action."
Meanwhile, in a room blazing with
television lights, the Nixon
administration's top energy officials
began working with the Senate today
on the emergency energy legislation
requested by the President.
Love Testifies
The first witness, White House
energy adviser John A. Love, made it
clear that the President is asking for
more authority than Chairman Henry
M. Jackson of the Senate Interior
Committee may be willing to grant.
Love asked the committee to
amend the Emergency Petroleum Act
authored by Jackson, D-Wash., to
allow the President to deregulate
natural gas at the well head and grant
more far-reaching waivers from the
emission requirements of air quality
standards.
Jackson, who Wednesday night
predicted the committee would
approve a bill today, replied, "I don't
believe in this emergency legislation.
We can start dealing with the whole
problem of gas, including
deregulation."
Train Concurs
Russell E. Train, head of the
Environmental Protection Agency,

seconded Love's request for authority
to waive so-called primary air
standards designed to protect public
health and safety. The waiver would
be needed to permit the burning of
d : rtier fuels, Train indicated.
Jackson's bill specifically prohibits
granting any variances in emission
requirements that would violate the
primary standards.
