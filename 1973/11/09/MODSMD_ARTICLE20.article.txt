Western movie makers have
always liked to rework innovative
story lines from Japanes movies,
so The Seven Samurai became The
Magnificent Seven, and Yojimbo
became A Fistful of
Dollars.
Woman of the Dunes, a
1964 Japanese movie that met
with wide critical acclaim, has also
been subject to reworking its
story ideas, but not as obviously.
A modern man of scientific
bent is out collecting insects in an
isolated, wideswept areas of sandy
seascoast. He is subsequently
tricked into becoming a virtual
slave in a small village that
desperately needs strong bodies to
shovel sand.
Sand is threatening to destroy
the village, and only by hauling it
away at night can houses be kept
from being engulfed.
The man doesn't take to being
used in this fashion, and tries to
escape from the young widowed
woman and the villagers whose
house he is saving from the sand.
New Outlook
But his enforced captivity gives
him a new outlook on life, and he
begins to feel drawn to the
woman and her existance so far
removed from the bustle of
modern Tokyo.
The most recent movie to use a
variation of this story line was
The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing,
with Sarah Miles falling for Burt
Reynolds after being held by

Reynolds against her will.
And three years ago, The
Hunting Party had the citified
Candice Bergen being carried off
by illiterate lout Oliver Reed, but
after a bit of captivity, learning to
love her new life and the virile
Reed.
Conflict Within
The difference with Woman of
the Dunes and these later films is
that here no one is out actively
searching for the missing person.
The conflict between his present
enforced way of life and the
bustle of Tokyo is all within
himself, with no human reminders
from the city.
So, helped by some artsy but
very effective cinematography by
Hiroshi Segawa, the film becomes
a parable of the conflicts of
modern living, on one level very
real, on another a surreal fantasy.
But without two fine
performances by Eiji Okada as the
trapped man and Kyodo Kishida
as the simple but exotic woman,
the film would have been nothing
more than a long lesson in sand
photography.
As it is, the film is a bit long as
it meanders toward its obvious
ending. But Japanese are patient,
and a bit of patience now would
have movie goers enjoying one of
the best Japanese films of the
19605.
Woman of the Dunes can
currently be seen at the Festival
Cinema Theater in Palo Alto.
