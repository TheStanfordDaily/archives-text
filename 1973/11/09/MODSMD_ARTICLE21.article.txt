# Cuban Revolutionary Film Tonight
## 
### EDGARDO ARCE-TORRES 
An extraordinary example of
Cuban film production in
post-revolutionary Cuba will be
screened tonight, at Bishop
Auditorium. Under the
sponsorship of the Law School's
Soledad Prison Project, Memorias
del Subdesarrollo (Memories of
Underdevelopment) will be shown
for the first time on the Stanford
campus, at 7:30 and 9:30.
Directed by Thomas Gutierrez
Alea, an organizer of the cinema
section for the Department of
Culture of the Rebel Army,
Memorias affords a personal,
critical study of the Cuban
Revolution. Set in the early years
of the triumph of the Revolution,
this full-length feature film
documents the perceptions of

Sergio (Sergio Correri), a
bourgeois Cuban intellectual, who
understands but can not become
involved with the process. (Sergio
is a landlord and thus not a
member of the labor force.)
What is achieved is a complete
study of the difficult transitional
changes of a socialist country
laboring to overcome the effects
of centuries of colonialism and
neo-colonialism. The film-maker
creates a fresh third-world
alternative to the usually
commercial Hollywood

"political" films a la Costa-Gavras.
The audience is not exhorted to
revolution through the
personification of a script
writers' ideal of revolution; rather
the audience sees the revolution as
a real and personal fact (and thus
not an abstract-intellectual one).
Documentary footage from the
Bay of Pigs invasion, and the
mobilization of the People's Self
Defense Forces during the Cuban
Missle Crisis brings home the
concrete reality of revolution and
underdevelopment.
