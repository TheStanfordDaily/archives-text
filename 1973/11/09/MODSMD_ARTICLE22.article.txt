# Cross Country Championships
## Cards Host Pac-8 Stars 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford golf course is the
site of tomorrow's Pacific Eight
cross country championship, a
meet which promises to be one of
the finest competitions in
conference history.
If the sun should choose to
shine on the 11 a.m. race the stage
will be set for an exciting duel
between two of the nation's
perennial distance powers, Oregon
and Washington State, and their
respective superstars, Steve
Prefontaine and John Ngeno.
In the Northern Division meet
two weeks ago, the two battled it
out the entire six miles over a
rain-drenched course, with
Prefontaine coming away the
victor by less than a second.
Ngeno, the 1972 champion, feels
its going to be different this week.
"I will catch his tail this time,"
said the sophomore from Kenya.
Stanford comes into the meet
after a respectable season
highlighted by Tony Sandoval's
29:03 school record.
"Realistically, we can't expect
to upset teams like Oregon or
Washington State," said Coach
Marshall Clark. "If our guys run as
well as they did against Cal three

weeks ago, we should finish
somewhere in the middle."
Fourth Last Year
The Cards were fourth last year
behind Washington State, Oregon
and Oregon State. With
Washington State and Oregon the
heavy favorites, and a vastly
improved Cal team to contend
with, Stanford is unlikely to finish
any higher than that in
tomorrow's meet.
Cal has already defeated the
Cards twice this season, and it is
doubtful that the Bears can be
caught Saturday. The team
Stanford is closest to overtaking is
UCLA, who barely captured the
runner-up position in the
Southern Division, nudging the
Cards 53-55 two weeks ago.
The unknown factors in
tomorrow's race are USC, Oregon
State and Washington. The
Trojans list only a five man squad
— the minimum number for
scoring — and in the Southern
Division meet they did not field
the full team and thus did not
score.
First Division Threats
Oregon State and Washington
could be the real threats to a first

division finish by the Cards,
though. In the Northern Division
meet there was a big gap between
Oregon and Washington State's 33
and 37 points and the 79 and 80
scored by Oregon State and
Washington.
"They've always got good
teams up north," said Clark. "Just
because Oregon State and
Washington couldn't come close
to the other two doesn't mean
they won't do well against the rest
of the conference."
If the weather is good
tomorrow, Prefontaine and Ngeno
will be going for Prefontaine's
course record of 28:32.4, set at
the conference meet in 1969.
Clark expects the top five to all go
under 29:00.
Seven-Man Squad
The Cards will be running a
seven-man squad, led by Sandoval,
the Southern Division winner. His
top back-up men, Jack Bellah and
Mark McConnell, are both on the
Stanford all-time top 10 list. Alan
Cummings and Art Brown are the
other two veterans on the team
with freshmen Steve Crowley and
Jeff Parietti completing the group
and Frank Boutin as alternate.
Oregon boasts Ail-American
Randy James as Prefontaine's
number-two man, with support
from Tom Hale, Terry Williams
and Bob Grubbs. Washington
State will be led by Ngeno along
with Dan Murphy and Dave
Harper, who were third and fifth
respectively in the Northern
Division meet.
Oregon State's strength is
topped by Leonard Hill and Jose
Amaya. Washington's Mike
Tolleson was outstanding in track
last spring and will be pacing his
team tomorrow.
Cal's trio of Brian Maxwell,
Gregg Hall and Bill Johnson have
already run the Stanford course
twice this year and should finish
well tomorrow. UCLA's Curtis
Beck and Gordon Innes will be
leading the Bruins as they try to
stay ahead of Stanford. Leigh
Reilly, who took fifth in the
southern division, and Fred
Ritcherson are two of The
Trojans' representatives.

CONCENTRATION — George Pettinger of the Culos anxiously awaits
the football during yesterday's intramural "B" playoffs behind the
Stanford Stadium. Pettinger caught two touchdown passes, but his
Culo team lost 13-12 when the KA's moved the ball 50 yards on two
desperation passes with 20 seconds remaining (See IM Roundup
below).
