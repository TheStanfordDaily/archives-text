# Soccer Chatter Amuses Fans
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Soccer players say the darndest
things. The chatter, so reminiscent
of little league ballplayers, has
found a home among the Stanford
booters.
A fan taking in one of the
Cards home games not only gets
the visual delight of watching a
top college soccer team in action,
but also receives the added
attraction of an audio portion,
courtesy of inspired players and
encouraging coaches.
Although these comments may
not always be music to the ears,
they add an interesting dimension
to the game, so often missing
from competitive activities.
Leading the Cardinal

word-per-niinute effort are goalie
Walt Harris and halfback Phil
Wright. Harris, the team captain,
has a double responsibility.
He must try to keep the
players aware of the position of
the ball, directing the defensive
efforts. Harris is also the
inspirational leader, both on and
off the field.
"Right wing," Harris will yell,
not referring to anyone's political
position, but to the location of
the ball. "Back to me," he will tell
his players, if he wants them to
kick him the ball to clear it
upfield.
Encouraging Words
When the action occurs away
from Harris' end of the field, he
will yell encouraging and
instructive words. "Settle it,"
advises his players to control the
ball and slow down the pace. He
may also add a "Let's go red," or
"nice shot" to urge on an
offensive drive.
Wright usually divides his
numerous comments between
praise of fine individual efforts
and pointing out temporary
lapses.
"Good job Bobby ... good
hustle Brian," is often heard. But
when performance tapers off, he'll
remind his teammates what they
have to do. "We've got to go to
the ball," urges the Cards to play
aggressively.
Other players join in the verbal
fun, adding to the team spirit.
"Let's go red . . . keep that ball on
the ground," and"I got it, damn
it I called it" were two of the
choice phrases of a recent game.
But the Cards do not have a
monopoly on oral action on the
soccer field. Wednesday, Cal
State-Hayward, demonstrated
their dominance with the mouth,
a thing they could not do with
their overall play.
'Little More Talking'
The white-clad opponents
offered many inspiring comments
to those fans who cared to listen.
"Come on white, you've got to
play," and "Little more talking
now white," were reactions to
early Hay ward efforts.
One Hayward player came up
with "He's only three feet tall,
let's go now," referring to
Stanford's goalie as Hayward had
a good scoring opportunity.
The phrase of the game came
from the Hayward sidelines

following Stanford's final score.
Someone asked what the goalie
was doing and got the response
that he "must be picking his nose
back there."
The referrees even got into the
action disciplining a Hayward
player: "Come on 12, cut it out
now. Keep your hands down."
And of course, when the
players believe the refs blew a call
they stare, turn away and softly
utter phrases that only the most
curious lipreader ever deciphers.
So the next time you take in a
soccer game, while your eyes
follow the action on the field, let
your ears follow the verbal action.
Chances are you'll discover that
there is more to soccer than
you've seen in the past.
