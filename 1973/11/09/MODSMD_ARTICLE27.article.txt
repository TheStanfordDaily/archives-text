# Card Poloists Face Southern Rivals
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's water polo team
travels to Los Angeles this
weekend to face its toughest
challenge of the year. Today the
Cards face UCLA at 2 p.m. and
tomorrow they meet USC's
Trojans at 10 a.m.
The Polo Bruins defeated the
Cards earlier this year, 7-4. Garth
Bergeson scored four goals in that
game, despite the fact that the
Cards sloughed on him the whole
game. Kurt Krumpolz also hurt
the Card defense by scoring two
goals. Both Krumpolz and
Bergeson were members of the
Bruins' NCAA championship team
last year.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
blamed the earlier loss on the
Cards' unsuccessful attempt to
slough on Bergeson. But Gaughran
still feels that a strategy on
sloughing can work and that is the
strategy the Cards will employ
this afternoon.
Gaughran admitted that if he
were making the odds on today's
game he would probably favor the
Bruins, but he felt that his team
can beat UCLA if the Cards can
stop Bergeson and eliminate
Stanford's troublesome
"one-quarter letdown."
"We've been playing good
water polo for three quarters," he

said, "but that one-quarter
letdown has hurt us."
UCLA plays in the Sunset
Canyon Recreation Center, which
is a very large pool. The Cards
have been practicing in the
50-meter pool this week to
prepare for the fast, offensive
game that this type of pool
produces.
Tomorrow Stanford faces the
men of Troy, who defeated the
Cards 7-6 last Friday in a game
which the Cards again let down
for one quarter. USC lost to
California 7-3 last Saturday, as the
Bears avenged an earlier 7-6 loss
to the Trojans.
Gaughran felt that the second
game against Cal indicated the
type of team USC really is. "When
they play down south, they have
Southern California refs who
allow a more physical game,
which is the style SC likes to
play," he said.
Bruce Koscis led the Trojans
last week with two goals. However
Gaughran indicated that the
Cards, who outscored the Trojans
2-1 in the second half, will not
concentrate on Koscis. "I don't
think SC has any one individual
we've got to worry about," he
said.
The Trojans play in Bovard
Pool, which is famous around the
Pac-8 for its shallow end. USC
plays its best games at Bovard
because it allows for a more
physical contest. Opponents must
adapt to the pool — a difficult
task after playing an entire season
in a regular pool.
However, the Cards have been
working out in the shallow end of
their own pools to prepare for the
strange surroundings. "Their pool
will require our goalie to go back
to his high school experience in
shallow ends."

adapt to the pool — a difficult
task after playing an entire season
in a regular pool.
However, the Cards have been
working out in the shallow end of
their own pools to prepare for the
strange surroundings. "Their pool
will require our goalie to go back
to his high school experience in
shallow ends."
Stanford's water polo team
travels to Los Angeles this
weekend to face its toughest
challenge of the year. Today the
Cards face UCLA at 2 p.m. and
tomorrow they meet USC's
Trojans at 10 a.m.
The Polo Bruins defeated the
Cards earlier this year, 7-4. Garth
Bergeson scored four goals in that
game, despite the fact that the
Cards sloughed on him the whole
game. Kurt Krumpolz also hurt
the Card defense by scoring two
goals. Both Krumpolz and
Bergeson were members of the
Bruins' NCAA championship team
last year.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
blamed the earlier loss on the
Cards' unsuccessful attempt to
slough on Bergeson. But Gaughran
still feels that a strategy on
sloughing can work and that is the
strategy the Cards will employ
this afternoon.
Gaughran admitted that if he
were making the odds on today's
game he would probably favor the
Bruins, but he felt that his team
can beat UCLA if the Cards can
stop Bergeson and eliminate
Stanford's troublesome
"one-quarter letdown."
"We've been playing good
water polo for three quarters," he

said, "but that one-quarter
letdown has hurt us."
UCLA plays in the Sunset
Canyon Recreation Center, which
is a very large pool. The Cards
have been practicing in the
50-meter pool this week to
prepare for the fast, offensive
game that this type of pool
produces.
Tomorrow Stanford faces the
men of Troy, who defeated the
Cards 7-6 last Friday in a game
which the Cards again let down
for one quarter. USC lost to
California 7-3 last Saturday, as the
Bears avenged an earlier 7-6 loss
to the Trojans.
Gaughran felt that the second
game against Cal indicated the
type of team USC really is. "When
they play down south, they have
Southern California refs who
allow a more physical game,
which is the style SC likes to
play," he said.
Bruce Koscis led the Trojans
last week with two goals. However
Gaughran indicated that the
Cards, who outscored the Trojans
2-1 in the second half, will not
concentrate on Koscis. "I don't
think SC has any one individual
we've got to worry about," he
said.
The Trojans play in Bovard
Pool, which is famous around the
Pac-8 for its shallow end. USC
plays its best games at Bovard
because it allows for a more
physical contest. Opponents must
adapt to the pool — a difficult
task after playing an entire season
in a regular pool.
