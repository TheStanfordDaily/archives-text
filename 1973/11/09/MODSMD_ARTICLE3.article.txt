# Israel, Egypt Reach Agreement; Five-Point Cease Fire Outlined
## 
### Associated Press 
Israel and Egypt both have agreed
to a five-point cease-fire agreement
that could produce peace talks on a
Middle East settlement by the end of
the year, U.S. officials said.
The officials, with Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger in Saudi
Arabia on the last leg of a Mideast trip,
met with newsmen early today and
said the agreement still had to be
submitted to U.N. Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim.
The agreement, the officials said,
would ease tensions by providing an
exchange of prisoners and giving the
Egyptians access to their encircled
Third Army on the east bank of the
Suez Canal and to the city of Suez on
the west bank.
The officials said the agreement
calls for readjustment of the cease-fire
line to conform with terms of the Oct.
22 U.N. cease-fire resolution.
Israeli and Egyptian officers met
yesterday to discuss a new cease-fire
line in accordance with the reported
cease-fire plan, Israeli Defense Ministry
sources said yesterday in Tel Aviv.
U.S. Is 'Trustee'
The U.S. officials, describing
Washington as "the trustee" of the
new cease-fire agreement, said action
to implement the agreement could
begin in a matter of days.
At the United Nations in New
York, it was learned that U.S.
Ambassador John A. Scali had an
appointment with Waldheim this

morning, apparently to give him a
copy of the agreement.
The U.S. officials said it was
understood that the agreement also
would provide for the lifting of a
blockade that has barred Israeli ships
from going from the Red Sea to the
Persian Gulf.
Follows Trip
Announcement of the agreement
followed Kissinger's trip to Morocco,
Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia, where he conferred with Arab
leaders.
An assistant secretary of state,
Joseph J. Sisco, flew to Tel Aviv

Wednesday to tell Israeli Prime
Minister Golda Meir of Kissinger's
talks with President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt.
Kissinger met for 90 minutes last
night with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia,
the largest Mideast oil-producing
nation. The Arabs have cut off oil
shipments to the United States and the
Netherlands and have cut back
shipments to other countries by as
much as 25 percent.
No Syrian Accord
The U.S. officials with Kissinger
said Syria had not endorsed the
agreement.

U.S. officials were so certain of
Cairo's approval of the new agreement
that they said the package did not
have to be submitted to Sadat now
that Israel has accepted it.
President Sadat and Syrian officials
have said in the past that they would
never bargain directly with
representatives of Israel. Washington
has taken an ambiguous stand,
suggesting at times the United States
favors face-to-face negotiating and at
other times suggesting that
negotiations be conducted through an
intermediary while the two sides
