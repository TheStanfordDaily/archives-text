# Stanford Remembers
## Cards, Trojans Set For Showdown 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Remember last year at
Stanford Stadium, when John
McKay said he'd "like to beat
Stanford by 2,000 points. They
are the worst winners I've ever
come up against. They have no
class." Remember?
Well, Stanford's football
players haven't forgotten, even
though McKay made a
half-hearted apology at last
spring's Stanford Senior Athletes'
banquet. USC's vitriolic coach,
however, doesn't think his March
visit will temper the Card's
animosity.
"The people I spoke to aren't
going to play Saturday," he said.
"They were seniors."
So the stage is set for
Stanford's angry underclassmen of
1972 to vent their 1973
frustrations tomorrow afternoon
at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
USC, eighth ranked nationally,
carries a 6-1-1 record into the
contest, while the Cards,
unranked but "receiving votes" in
this week's AP poll, are 5-3.
A crowd of 80,000 is expected
for the 1:30 p.m. kickoff.
Oddsmakers have picked the
Trojans to prevail by margins
ranging from 13 to 2,000 points,
but the concensus seems to be

around 26.
"When you go into a game like
this, in a series as hard fought as
ours has been over the years, and
make one team a 26-point
favorite ..said a disbelieving
McKay when he heard the odds.
Stanford 'Improving'
"Stanford is improving. They
beat Washington State very badly
and we didn't. They ran
tremendously well against Oregon
State," and, McKay added, "I
think Stanford is one of the better
defensive teams on the coast."
Still, the Cards are no match
statistically for the defending
national champions. USC boasts a
16-game Pac-8 unbeaten streak
(Stanford is the last team to have
defeated the Trojans in league
play) and Anthony Davis, Rod
McNeill and Allen Carter — USC's
"talented trio of tailbacks" —
netted 355 yards between them
last week while taking turns at the
tailback spot.
And Davis, despite any rumors
to the contrary, isn't having a bad
year himself. He has already rolled
up 678 yards on the ground —
exactly 100 yards ahead of the
pace that brought him 1,191
yards and instant national acclaim
a year ago.
In the other departments, USC
isn't exactly scraping the barrel
for talent. Versatile flanker Lynn
Swann, like Davis a Heisman
Trophy possibility, leads the Pac-8
with 31 receptions for 527 yards
and fivo touchdowns. The Johnny
Rodgers-like Swann also returns
punts and carries the ball
occasionally on end around plays
and inside reverses.
"Stingy" Defense
At quarterback, Pat Haden has
completed 55 percent of his
passes for 1212 yards and 11
touchdowns. And the defense,
with such standouts as linebacker
Richard Wood, safety Artimus
Parker, linebacker Charles
Anthony, defensive back Charles
Phillips and defensive end James
Sims (Sims, however is a
"doubtful" starter tomorrow),
dominates the conference
defensive statistics.
USC has allowed under 300
yards per game in total offense
and Trojan opponents have
manged to put an average of only
12.8 points on the scoreboard.
Despite all those statistics,
pollsters and oddsmakers,
however, Stanford remains far
from mesmerized. "We're not
going down there to get beat,"
said defensive back Jim Kaffen.

"We've got as good a shot as
anyone."
But can USC actually be
beaten? Notre Dame did it on
national television two weeks ago
by taking advantage of two
miserable Trojan punts early in
the game, kicking the ball away
from Davis and playing brutal
defense.
Christiansen obviously learned
something from that game in
South Bend, but he insists that
Stanford won't do anything
drastically different. "We
certainly will try to kick away
from Davis, but other than that,
we just want to give our guys an
opportunity to continue
blocking," said Chris, who
conducted closed practices in the
stadium Wednesday and Thursday
only because "the field was drier
than our practice field."
Physically Sound
Physically, Christiansen feels
like we're as sound as we've been
in the last three weeks." Geb
Church, with a twisted knee, was
the only started to miss any
practice this week, and he should
be ready by tomorrow.
And what about the Cards'
chances? "At times we've looked
good, at times terrible," Chris
said. "If we can just play like we
did against Washington State, then
maybe.. .."
Maybe, even, the Cards could
go to the Rose Bowl. Stanford
would have to win tomorrow,
USC would have to beat UCLA
and UCLA would have to lose or

tie either tomorrow against
Oregon or next week against
Oregon State.
"You know," Christiansen
said, "UCLA's greatest strength
this year is that they haven't
fumbled much, and Wishbone
teams normally lose four or five
fumbles a game. It may be rainy
and wet up in Oregon and the ball
could get slippery. ..
It's all a bit farfetched, but
Stanford could still wind up in
Pasadena on New Year's Day,
despite the fact that "all they're
talking about in L.A.," according
to Stanford sports information
director Bob Murphy, "is Nov.
24," when the Trojans meet the

Bruins.
The Cardinals, though, are just
thinking about tomorrow.

AD. ON THE MOVE—USC Heisman Trophy candidate Anthony
Davis tries to maneuver past Stanford's Pat Moore during last year s
Card-Trojan battle at Stanford Stadium. Davis, who scored five
touchdowns last week against California, currently leads the Trojan
ballcarriers with 678 yards in eight games. A.D. has scored 10
touchdowns.

LOOKING FOR REVENGE —Stanford coach Jack Christiansen and
defensive back James Ferguson seem displeased by the happenings
during last year's game between the Cards and USC, but tomorrow
both will have a chance for revenge at the Los Angeles Coliseum. USC,
with a 6-1-1 record, is rated the overwhelming favorite over Stanford
(5-3) in the 1:30 p.m. contest.
