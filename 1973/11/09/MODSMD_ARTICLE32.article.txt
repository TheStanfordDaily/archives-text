# L.A. Coliseum Brings Back Fond Football Memories
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Games played in the Los
Angeles Coliseum have always
been special events for Stanford
players and students. Thousands
of students make the trip south to
experience a weekend full of
parties, freeway and football.
The annual game in Los
Angeles has taken on added
significance for most of the past
six seasons, because it has proved
crucial to Cardinal football
fortunes. Stanford players can't
help but have an eye on the past
as they approach tomorrow's
game in Los Angeles.
For most of the 60s, USC and
UCLA took turns mopping up
weak Stanford squads before
80,000 rabid fans in the Coliseum.
But the arrival of the likes of Jim
Plunkett and Gene Washington
served notice that the Bruins and
Trojans might have to fight
someone other than each other to
get to the Rose Bowl.
In 1968, a Stanford-USC
UCLA rivalry erupted, a rivalry
which produced some of the
finest collegiate games of their
respective years. Many of these
took place in the hostile environs
of the Coliseum, with familiar
names like O.J. Simpson, Jim
Plunkett, Don Bunce and Jackie
Brown in the starring roles.
The Cards dropped a
heartbreaker to USC in Palo Alto
in 1968 as Simpson ran for 220
yards to lead the Trojans to a
27-24 victory. Steve Horowitz
missed three short field goals in
the first quarter.
Bruins Rear Back
Stanford still nurtured slim
Rose Bowl hopes as they traveled
to L.A. late in the season to face
the Bruins. The Cards led 14-0 at
the half but UCLA roared back to
notch a 20-17 win that dashed
Stanford's Rose Bowl hopes.
It was Southern Cal's
opportunity to host the Cards the
following year in a game that has
become one of the classic
Stanford-USC meetings. The
Trojans won on a 27-yard field
goal by Ron Ayala with no time
on the clock, 26-24.

Plunkett passed for 296 yards
and brought the Cards into
position for a successful Steve
Horowitz 37-yard field goal with
1:03 remaining, but quarterback
Jimmy Jones brought SC back for
the winning field goal that cleared
the uprights by six inches and
forced the Cards to wait another
year.
UCLA further disheartened
Stanford that season in Palo Alto
by blocking a field goal attempt
by Horowithz with four seconds
left to salvage a 20-20 tie.
Revenge In 1970
The Card seniors, led by
Plunkett, had two years of close
losses to avenge in 1970. They
hosted USC early in the season
and trounced them, 24-14.
Plunkett passed for 275 yards and
the defense held the Trojans twice
on fourth and one situations
inside the three-yard line. It was a
victory long-awaited and well
earned.
Stanford had to defeat UCLA
at the Coliseum, however, to get
to Pasadena. Steve Horowitz had
his revenge, kicking a 30-yard
field goal with 4:57 left to give
the Cards a 9-7 victory. Horowitz
kicked three field goals from
outside the 20-yard line as
Plunkett and UCLA signal-caller
Dennis Dummit became locked in
a passing stalemate. It was a big
win for Stanford and propelled
the Indians past their last major
obstacle to a New Year's Day date
in Pasadena.
Unaccustomed to the role of
champion, Stanford attempted to
defend its title in 1970, and for
the only year in recent memory,
the Cards had an easy time of it
with their Los Angeles opponents.
Stanford could not beat
Washington State, San Jose State
or Duke that year but
manhandled the Bruins and
Trojans.
80-Yard Play
Stanford was unkind to USC in
the Coliseum early that season,
dumping the Trojans 33-18. The
passing of Don Bunce and the
running of Jackie Brown and
Reggie Sanderson swamped SC.

On the key play of the game,
Bunce rolled around left end for
11 yards and pitched to
Sanderson as he was hit.
Sanderson took the ball the rest
of the way to complete anBo yard
scoring play that demoralized the
Trojans.
It proved fitting that the Cards
would clinch a second Rose Bowl
trip with a 20-9 win over the
Bruins at Stanford Stadium that
year. Bunce passed for 246 yards
and the outcome was never in
doubt.
The magic ended for Stanford
in 1972. The Cards suffered
narrow losses to both SC and
UCLA. Stanford gave the national
champion Trojans their toughest
battle of the year before bowing
30-21 before a home crowd. In
Los Angeles the Bruins outslugged
the Cards 28-23 in one of the
most exciting games ever played in
the Coliseum.
