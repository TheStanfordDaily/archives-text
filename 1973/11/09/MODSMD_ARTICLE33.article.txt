# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
The Daily's prognosticator,
angered by more well known
forecasters who have rated
USC from 25-26 point
favorites for tomorrow's game
in Los Angeles, almost decided
to pick a big upset. After all,
coach Jack Christiansen's
Cardinals have been playing
well of late, the players are
psyched beyond recognition
and Stanford has been known
to pull surprises.
But USC has Anthony
Davis, Lynn Swann, Pat Haden,
lovable John McKay and his
lovable son J.K. - and a
bruising defense. It will
definitely be interesting,
should be dose and will
probably result in a Trojan
victory.
In other PacB action, the
Daily risks its 25 5-1 record on
one sure bet and three toss-ups.
The sure bet, of course, is
UCLA. The Bruins travel to
Eugene to meet Oregon, and
the result should be normal â€”
100 yards or so for two or

three Bruin backs and another
easy UCLA victory.
Washington State and
Oregon State, Stanford's last
two victims, dash in
Corvallis, with the winner
moving to the edge of the first
division. The Cougars should
win a dose one.
Bay Area fans probably
won't be waiting in line for
tickets at California Memorial
Stadium, but tomorrow's
Cal-San Jose State game should
be worth watching. "This is the
finest San Jose team I've ever
seen," said Cat coach Mike
White. "There's no question
Cat should be favored," said
SJS coach Darryl Rogers. The
Daily picks for San Jose.
The Daily has also decided
to honor hapless Washington
by picking the Huskies to
defeat equally hapless Idaho.
USC 28, Stanford 20
UCLA 48, Oregon 13
Wash. St. 27, Oregon ST. 24
San Jose State 21, Cat 20
Washington 17, Idaho 7
