# Mirror Image At Coliseum?
## Trobabes Host Card JV's 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Officials of the Los Angeles
Coliseum could install a gigantic
mirror across midfield prior to
today's USC-Stanford junior
varsity game, and Gunther
Cunningham's Cards might not
even be aware of the change.
So similar are the Trobabes to
his own team that Cunningham
says the 1:30 p.m. contest will be
like we're playing ourselves."
One might infer from
Cunningham's statement that the
game will be a close one, and the
coach adds further weight to the
inference when he says USC "is in
the same boat as we are" in terms
of lack of practice time. "They
may practice a little more with
their varsity than we do," he says,
meaning less time to work
together as a unit.
Nevertheless, Cunningham
points out three members of the
enemy force as being a threat to
his ball club Friday: Butch
Underwood, a big recruit from
Atlanta who even sounds like a
linebacker; Bernard Tarver, a fleet
halfback who scored two
touchdowns in USC's 28-23 loss
to Cal last week; and Mike Carey,
a state high school all-star
quarterback from Riordan who
was playing defensive back for the
varsity earlier this season.
Cunningham thinks Carey will
be the next varsity QB at
Southern Cal, and suspects the
Trobabe offense will be "much
like their varsity's," with sweeps
and blasts out of the I-formation.
He expects to see a lot of option
runs, though, and fewer aerials
because "they don't have practice
time to practice passing."
Defensive Adjustments
To stop the Trojan offense,
Cunningham says, "We're gonna
make a couple of adjustments in
our 50 defense." He decided on
the changes after UC-Davis'
play-action offense slowed up the
Stanford pass rush in last week's
41-21 Card victory.
"When you run play action, it
slows down the pass rush because
it makes the linebackers respect
the run instead of rush the
passer," Cunningham said. Friday
he plans to send his linebackers
after quarterback Carey in an

effort to "pressure the offense
into mistakes."
Cunningham relies strongly on
"enthusiasm" in coaching his
squad, and feels the JV's morale is
"very high" now after a flat first
half against Davis. In fact, he
thinks, spirit is "a lot higher than
for UCLA" among the team
which, although heavy underdogs,
dominated the Brubabes before
losing a month ago.
Cordova to Start
Mike Cordova, who threw
three touchdown passes last week
against Davis, will once again be
the starting quarterback. Varsity
coach Jack Christiansen said that
he wants "to get Cordova as much
playing time as possible.' Chris
plans to have Cordova direct the
JV today and next week before
rejoining the varsity for the Big
Game against the Bears on Nov.
24.
Backing up Cordova is
option-expert Larry McGovern.
Cunningham remains very high on
McGovern, despite the fact that
the QB has seen only fourth
quarter action in two games.
"Some kids are winners — and
he's one," Cunningham said. The
coach hopes to let McGovern
direct an option running attack at
some time during the game, but
emphasizes that "we'll do
everything with McGovern that
any of the other quarterbacks
have done."
Last Week's Standouts
Rich Waters was named the top
defensive and Andy Kolesnikow
and Dave Nagler the top offensive
players of the Davis game by
Cunningham. Split end Nagler was
"outstanding" and fullback
Kolesnikow "did a great job of
blocking," the coach said.
Kolesnikow "made the holes
for those little running backs"
against Davis, Cunningham said,
and against the larger Trobabes
"he'll like it better with a bigger
target to work with."
"We've got to get him the ball
more" on dives and counter-dives,
Cunningham said, and even raised
the possibility of throwing to the
fullback.
Cunningham is moving reserve
fullback Don Stevenson to
linebacker, replacing Roger Greer,
who sustained a pinched nerve in

the Davis Game. Tight end Dave
Bruzzone will return from an
injury, but will play behind Barry
Cernoch. Mike Cummings, who
sacked Davis quarterbacks three
times, will start on defense.
Cunningham is cutting his
roster from 53 to 40 for the trip,
and is finding his practice time
limited by bad weather. Rain
Monday curtailed to 30 minutes
what Cunningham had planned as
an hour scrimmage "because we
haven't been tackling well."

fullback Don Stevenson to
linebacker, replacing Roger Greer,
who sustained a pinched nerve in

the Davis Game. Tight end Dave
Bruzzone will return from an
injury, but will play behind Barry
Cernoch. Mike Cummings, who
sacked Davis quarterbacks three
times, will start on defense.
Cunningham is cutting his
roster from 53 to 40 for the trip,
and is finding his practice time
limited by bad weather. Rain
Monday curtailed to 30 minutes
what Cunningham had planned as
an hour scrimmage "because we
haven't been tackling well."
Officials of the Los Angeles
Coliseum could install a gigantic
mirror across midfield prior to
today's USC-Stanford junior
varsity game, and Gunther
Cunningham's Cards might not
even be aware of the change.
So similar are the Trobabes to
his own team that Cunningham
says the 1:30 p.m. contest will be
like we're playing ourselves."
One might infer from
Cunningham's statement that the
game will be a close one, and the
coach adds further weight to the
inference when he says USC "is in
the same boat as we are" in terms
of lack of practice time. "They
may practice a little more with
their varsity than we do," he says,
meaning less time to work
together as a unit.
Nevertheless, Cunningham
points out three members of the
enemy force as being a threat to
his ball club Friday: Butch
Underwood, a big recruit from
Atlanta who even sounds like a
linebacker; Bernard Tarver, a fleet
halfback who scored two
touchdowns in USC's 28-23 loss
to Cal last week; and Mike Carey,
a state high school all-star
quarterback from Riordan who
was playing defensive back for the
varsity earlier this season.
Cunningham thinks Carey will
be the next varsity QB at
Southern Cal, and suspects the
Trobabe offense will be "much
like their varsity's," with sweeps
and blasts out of the I-formation.
He expects to see a lot of option
runs, though, and fewer aerials
because "they don't have practice
time to practice passing."
Defensive Adjustments
To stop the Trojan offense,
Cunningham says, "We're gonna
make a couple of adjustments in
our 50 defense." He decided on
the changes after UC-Davis'
play-action offense slowed up the
Stanford pass rush in last week's
41-21 Card victory.
"When you run play action, it
slows down the pass rush because
it makes the linebackers respect
the run instead of rush the
passer," Cunningham said. Friday
he plans to send his linebackers
after quarterback Carey in an

effort to "pressure the offense
into mistakes."
Cunningham relies strongly on
"enthusiasm" in coaching his
squad, and feels the JV's morale is
"very high" now after a flat first
half against Davis. In fact, he
thinks, spirit is "a lot higher than
for UCLA" among the team
which, although heavy underdogs,
dominated the Brubabes before
losing a month ago.
Cordova to Start
Mike Cordova, who threw
three touchdown passes last week
against Davis, will once again be
the starting quarterback. Varsity
coach Jack Christiansen said that
he wants "to get Cordova as much
playing time as possible.' Chris
plans to have Cordova direct the
JV today and next week before
rejoining the varsity for the Big
Game against the Bears on Nov.
24.
Backing up Cordova is
option-expert Larry McGovern.
Cunningham remains very high on
McGovern, despite the fact that
the QB has seen only fourth
quarter action in two games.
"Some kids are winners — and
he's one," Cunningham said. The
coach hopes to let McGovern
direct an option running attack at
some time during the game, but
emphasizes that "we'll do
everything with McGovern that
any of the other quarterbacks
have done."
Last Week's Standouts
Rich Waters was named the top
defensive and Andy Kolesnikow
and Dave Nagler the top offensive
players of the Davis game by
Cunningham. Split end Nagler was
"outstanding" and fullback
Kolesnikow "did a great job of
blocking," the coach said.
Kolesnikow "made the holes
for those little running backs"
against Davis, Cunningham said,
and against the larger Trobabes
"he'll like it better with a bigger
target to work with."
"We've got to get him the ball
more" on dives and counter-dives,
Cunningham said, and even raised
the possibility of throwing to the
fullback.

Kolesnikow "did a great job of
blocking," the coach said.
Kolesnikow "made the holes
for those little running backs"
against Davis, Cunningham said,
and against the larger Trobabes
"he'll like it better with a bigger
target to work with."
"We've got to get him the ball
more" on dives and counter-dives,
Cunningham said, and even raised
the possibility of throwing to the
fullback.
Cunningham is moving reserve
fullback Don Stevenson to
linebacker, replacing Roger Greer,
who sustained a pinched nerve in

the Davis Game. Tight end Dave
Bruzzone will return from an
injury, but will play behind Barry
Cernoch. Mike Cummings, who
sacked Davis quarterbacks three
times, will start on defense.
Cunningham is cutting his
roster from 53 to 40 for the trip,
and is finding his practice time
limited by bad weather. Rain
Monday curtailed to 30 minutes
what Cunningham had planned as
an hour scrimmage "because we
haven't been tackling well."
