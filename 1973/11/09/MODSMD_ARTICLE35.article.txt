# More Than A Football Game
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Tomorrow in Los Angeles, the only authentic
grudge match on the Stanford football schedule
takes place in the Coliseum. The University of
Southern California, more widely hated around
here than even Richard Nixon, hosts the
Cardinals in what many see as a struggle of two
lifestyles.
The Cal contest is billed as the Big Game, and
for most alumni it still is. But anyone who's
spent time around Stanford in the last four or
five years knows that there is one game that's
more important: with USC. It will be a long drive
back Sunday if the Cards don't at least come
close.
It's more than just a football game, though.
Both campuses harbor a genuine hatred for each
other. Most Stanford students regard USC as an
arrogant, militaristic, quasi-fascist summer camp
where no one cares about anything but football.
They see USC as an enemy of American
democracy, and figure it's a favor to the rest of
the country if the Trojans lose.
On the other hand, USC views Stanford as a
psuedo-intellectual ivory tower full of elitist
snobs who need to get knocked on their
collective ass. "I'd like to beat Stanford by2ooo
points. They are the worst winners I've ever
come up against," snarled Trojan Coach John
McKay after his team took a 30-21 victory last
year. "They have no class."
McKay did his best to make the 2000 last
year, ordering his quarterback to throw long
passes in the closing minutes, even though the
game was wrapped up.
'Radcliffe of the West'
Lest you think this was an idle lapse on
McKay's part, later on he referred to Stanford as
"the Radcliffe of the West."
"For Christ's sake, at least it isn't the
Reichstag of the West," one student told the
Daily yesterday. "You haven't seen any Stanford
alumni on the list of Watergate conspirators." He

was referring to the seven USC graduates who
have been linked, directly or indirectly, with the
Watergate scandal.
The rivalry has only grown up over the last
five years, when Stanford resumed its role as
football power. In 1969, 70, and 71, the Cards
challenged USC for a bid to the Rose Bowl: they
lost by two points in 1969, but won the next
two years on the way to victories in Pasadena.
Last year Stanford was again expected to be
the top competition for USC, and they were: the
nine-point victory was the closest game on the
Trojan schedule.
Vicious Emotion
During the prolonged war for the roses, the
two schools began to dislike each other, natural
enough for anyone competing for such a major
prize. But during the last couple of years, the
dislike has become a much more vicious
emotion.
"It's a sort of a thing where we say, 'They're
the enemy and we've got to beat them. What's
wrong with them?' " points out Jerry Coleman,
the band announcer. "And for Stanford students,
it's very easy to pick out things that are wrong
with Southern Cal. The way their coach talks, for
instance."
The battle will go beyond the football game.
The two bands will also be struggling, and while
the USC football team is ranked as a favorite,
odds-makers will certainly make Stanford's band
a 20-point favorite over the Trojans, who march
around in vintage MGM Roman armor and play
music from Ben Hur.
"When they play that goddam theme music
and start strutting around. I realize what a
menace to society they are," another student
says. "We shouldn't just beat them, we should
have them locked up."
On that note, many Stanford students will
start the trek to Los Angeles today. In 36 hours,
they'll know which is made ofstrongerstuff â€”
Radcliffe or the Reichstag.
