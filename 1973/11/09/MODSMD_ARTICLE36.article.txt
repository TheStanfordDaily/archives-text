Nixoa'i Secretary Testifies
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's personal secretary
testified yesterday that the quality of some of the
subpoenaed Watergate tapes is so bad that no one will be
able to hear every word.
Rose Mary Woods told of laboring nearly a month,
sometimes until 3 and 4 in the morning, trying to
transcribe Watergate conversations from recordings made
surreptitiously in the President's offices.
Asked whether she was able to make a verbatim
transcript. Miss Woods said: "I don't think any human
being could. Maybe a technician. I could not get every
word. I don't think anyone else .. The sentence was
left incomplete.
Later in the day the court was to hear from another
Nixon intimate, H.R. Haldeman, who resigned as
presidential chief of staff April 30 in the heat of the
Watergate scandal.
Miss Woods' testimony was the first in six days of
hearings to contend that the quality of the tapes was
poor. A technician had testified earlier that even whispers
could be picked up by the sensitive microphones placed in
the President's desks and into wall lamps.
Haldeman, who had listened to one tape, said this
about the tape's quality when asked by the Senate
Watergate committee: "It's good at times and not good at
times. It's the kind of tape recording you have in a large
room which the Oval Office is; there is a lot of echo and
bounce. It's difficult to follow the conversation
completely, but it is not by any means impossible."
Kemper Convicted Of Murders
SANTA CRUZ — A jury convicted giant Edmund Emil
Kemper 111 on eight counts of first-degree murder
yesterday and declared him sane in the mutilation slayings
of his mother and seven other women.
It was the second mass slaying conviction in three
months in this seashore city and brought to 10 the
number of murders on Kemper's record.
Kemper, now 25, was sent to a state mental hospital 10
years ago for murdering his paternal grandparents.
He is to be sentenced today and could receive a life
prison term on each count.
The hulking 6-9 Kemper showed no emotion as he
heard the verdict. The six man, six woman jury had
deliberated five hours.
Kemper had pleaded innocent, and innocent by reason
of insanity to killing his mother, her best friend and six
hitchhiking coeds.
"I agree entirely with your verdict," Santa Cruz
Superior Court Judge Harry Brauer told the jury. "If I
seemed a bit concerned, it was because I thought you
might have some other findings," he said.
Fugitives Captured In Sacramento
SACRAMENTO — Two fugitives were hunted down in
Sacramento yesterday, arrested without a fight and
booked for investigation of murder in the execution-style

slaying of nine persons in a Central California home.
They were taken to Stockton, 50 miles south of
Sacramento, after their arrest and each was booked on
nine counts of murder, the office of San Joaquin County
Sheriff Michael N. Canlis said.
One of the two had vowed he wouldn't be taken alive,
but he surrendered after Sacramento policemen fired one
tear gas shell into his apartment house refuge.
Douglas Gretzler, 22, of New York City, was arrested
at 10:10 a.m. in the Clunie Hotel four blocks from the
state Capitol.
Officers said they were tipped by a clerk who saw their
pictures in the Sacramento Union.
Police said Gretzler then told them they could find his
companion, Willie Luther Steelman, 28, of Lodi, in an
apartment house one-and-a-half miles away.
Police Guard School Officials
OAKLAND — Police were guarding tense Oakland
school officials yesterday in the wake of the assassination
of Supt. Marcus Foster for which the "Symbionese
Liberation Army" claimed responsibility.
The mysterious "Symbionese" communique said
"shoot-on-sight" orders would remain until "political
police" are banned from the Oakland School District.
Police Chief Charles Gain also shrugged off a terse call
to the Alameda County Coroner Wednesday night in
which a male caller said, "Chief Gain is next."
Foster and Deputy Supt. Robert Blackburn were cut
down in a hail of gunfire Tuesday night as they left a
meeting at the school district administration building.
Blackburn was reported still in serious condition but
improving yesterday in Highland Hospital.
Viet Cong Claim Victory
SAIGON — The Viet Cong claimed yesterday their
forces mauled government troops along the Cambodian
border and accused the Saigon government of inflicting
more than 100 civilian casualties during an air strike.
A spokesman for the Viet Cong delegation to the Joint
Military' Commission said three battalions of government
troops were put out of action. He said 20 military vehicles
and hundreds of assorted weapons were captured in
fighting Sunday around two government outposts along
the Cambodian frontier in Quang Due Province.
Government outposts at Bu Bong and Bu Prang, about
125 miles northeast of Saigon, were seized by North
Vietnamese tanks and troops. Saigon forces have
withdrawn from a nearby road junction.
Today's Weather
Increasing clouds today with chance of rain. Rain
likely tonight becoming partly cloudy tomorrow. Little
temperature change. Low tonight in 50s. High today and
tomorrow in 60s. South-west wind 5 to 15 mph becoming
southerly 15 to 30 mph today. Chance of rain 40 percent
today and 60 percent tonight.

Haldeman, who had listened to one tape, said this

Kemper Convicted Of Murders
SANTA CRUZ — A jury convicted giant Edmund Emil
Kemper 111 on eight counts of first-degree murder
yesterday and declared him sane in the mutilation slayings
of his mother and seven other women.
It was the second mass slaying conviction in three
months in this seashore city and brought to 10 the
number of murders on Kemper's record.
Kemper, now 25, was sent to a state mental hospital 10
years ago for murdering his paternal grandparents.
He is to be sentenced today and could receive a life
prison term on each count.
The hulking 6-9 Kemper showed no emotion as he
heard the verdict. The six man, six woman jury had
deliberated five hours.
Kemper had pleaded innocent, and innocent by reason
of insanity to killing his mother, her best friend and six
hitchhiking coeds.
"I agree entirely with your verdict," Santa Cruz
Superior Court Judge Harry Brauer told the jury. "If I
seemed a bit concerned, it was because I thought you
might have some other findings," he said.
Fugitives Captured In Sacramento
SACRAMENTO — Two fugitives were hunted down in
Sacramento yesterday, arrested without a fight and
booked for investigation of murder in the execution-style

slaying of nine persons in a Central California home.
They were taken to Stockton, 50 miles south of
Sacramento, after their arrest and each was booked on
nine counts of murder, the office of San Joaquin County
Sheriff Michael N. Canlis said.
One of the two had vowed he wouldn't be taken alive,
but he surrendered after Sacramento policemen fired one
tear gas shell into his apartment house refuge.
Douglas Gretzler, 22, of New York City, was arrested
at 10:10 a.m. in the Clunie Hotel four blocks from the
state Capitol.
Officers said they were tipped by a clerk who saw their
pictures in the Sacramento Union.
Police said Gretzler then told them they could find his
companion, Willie Luther Steelman, 28, of Lodi, in an
apartment house one-and-a-half miles away.
Police Guard School Officials
OAKLAND — Police were guarding tense Oakland
school officials yesterday in the wake of the assassination
of Supt. Marcus Foster for which the "Symbionese
Liberation Army" claimed responsibility.
The mysterious "Symbionese" communique said
"shoot-on-sight" orders would remain until "political
police" are banned from the Oakland School District.
Police Chief Charles Gain also shrugged off a terse call
to the Alameda County Coroner Wednesday night in
which a male caller said, "Chief Gain is next."
Foster and Deputy Supt. Robert Blackburn were cut
down in a hail of gunfire Tuesday night as they left a
meeting at the school district administration building.
Blackburn was reported still in serious condition but
improving yesterday in Highland Hospital.
Viet Cong Claim Victory
SAIGON — The Viet Cong claimed yesterday their
forces mauled government troops along the Cambodian
border and accused the Saigon government of inflicting
more than 100 civilian casualties during an air strike.
A spokesman for the Viet Cong delegation to the Joint
Military' Commission said three battalions of government
troops were put out of action. He said 20 military vehicles
and hundreds of assorted weapons were captured in
fighting Sunday around two government outposts along
the Cambodian frontier in Quang Due Province.
Government outposts at Bu Bong and Bu Prang, about
125 miles northeast of Saigon, were seized by North
Vietnamese tanks and troops. Saigon forces have
withdrawn from a nearby road junction.

Haldeman, who had listened to one tape, said this
about the tape's quality when asked by the Senate
Watergate committee: "It's good at times and not good at
times. It's the kind of tape recording you have in a large
room which the Oval Office is; there is a lot of echo and
bounce. It's difficult to follow the conversation
completely, but it is not by any means impossible."
Kemper Convicted Of Murders
SANTA CRUZ — A jury convicted giant Edmund Emil
Kemper 111 on eight counts of first-degree murder
yesterday and declared him sane in the mutilation slayings
of his mother and seven other women.
It was the second mass slaying conviction in three
months in this seashore city and brought to 10 the
number of murders on Kemper's record.
Kemper, now 25, was sent to a state mental hospital 10
years ago for murdering his paternal grandparents.
He is to be sentenced today and could receive a life
prison term on each count.
The hulking 6-9 Kemper showed no emotion as he
heard the verdict. The six man, six woman jury had
deliberated five hours.
Kemper had pleaded innocent, and innocent by reason
of insanity to killing his mother, her best friend and six
hitchhiking coeds.
"I agree entirely with your verdict," Santa Cruz
Superior Court Judge Harry Brauer told the jury. "If I
seemed a bit concerned, it was because I thought you
might have some other findings," he said.
Fugitives Captured In Sacramento
SACRAMENTO — Two fugitives were hunted down in
Sacramento yesterday, arrested without a fight and
booked for investigation of murder in the execution-style

slaying of nine persons in a Central California home.
They were taken to Stockton, 50 miles south of
Sacramento, after their arrest and each was booked on
nine counts of murder, the office of San Joaquin County
Sheriff Michael N. Canlis said.
One of the two had vowed he wouldn't be taken alive,
but he surrendered after Sacramento policemen fired one
tear gas shell into his apartment house refuge.
Douglas Gretzler, 22, of New York City, was arrested
at 10:10 a.m. in the Clunie Hotel four blocks from the
state Capitol.
Officers said they were tipped by a clerk who saw their
pictures in the Sacramento Union.
Police said Gretzler then told them they could find his
companion, Willie Luther Steelman, 28, of Lodi, in an
apartment house one-and-a-half miles away.
Police Guard School Officials
OAKLAND — Police were guarding tense Oakland
school officials yesterday in the wake of the assassination
of Supt. Marcus Foster for which the "Symbionese
Liberation Army" claimed responsibility.
The mysterious "Symbionese" communique said
"shoot-on-sight" orders would remain until "political
police" are banned from the Oakland School District.
Police Chief Charles Gain also shrugged off a terse call
to the Alameda County Coroner Wednesday night in
which a male caller said, "Chief Gain is next."
Foster and Deputy Supt. Robert Blackburn were cut
down in a hail of gunfire Tuesday night as they left a
meeting at the school district administration building.
Blackburn was reported still in serious condition but
improving yesterday in Highland Hospital.
Viet Cong Claim Victory
SAIGON — The Viet Cong claimed yesterday their
forces mauled government troops along the Cambodian
border and accused the Saigon government of inflicting
more than 100 civilian casualties during an air strike.
A spokesman for the Viet Cong delegation to the Joint
Military' Commission said three battalions of government
troops were put out of action. He said 20 military vehicles
and hundreds of assorted weapons were captured in
fighting Sunday around two government outposts along
the Cambodian frontier in Quang Due Province.
Government outposts at Bu Bong and Bu Prang, about
125 miles northeast of Saigon, were seized by North
Vietnamese tanks and troops. Saigon forces have
withdrawn from a nearby road junction.

Nixoa'i Secretary Testifies
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's personal secretary
testified yesterday that the quality of some of the
subpoenaed Watergate tapes is so bad that no one will be
able to hear every word.
Rose Mary Woods told of laboring nearly a month,
sometimes until 3 and 4 in the morning, trying to
transcribe Watergate conversations from recordings made
surreptitiously in the President's offices.
Asked whether she was able to make a verbatim
transcript. Miss Woods said: "I don't think any human
being could. Maybe a technician. I could not get every
word. I don't think anyone else .. The sentence was
left incomplete.
Later in the day the court was to hear from another
Nixon intimate, H.R. Haldeman, who resigned as
presidential chief of staff April 30 in the heat of the
Watergate scandal.
Miss Woods' testimony was the first in six days of
hearings to contend that the quality of the tapes was
poor. A technician had testified earlier that even whispers
could be picked up by the sensitive microphones placed in
the President's desks and into wall lamps.
Haldeman, who had listened to one tape, said this
about the tape's quality when asked by the Senate
Watergate committee: "It's good at times and not good at
times. It's the kind of tape recording you have in a large
room which the Oval Office is; there is a lot of echo and
