# Faculty Senate Meeting
## Teaching Evaluation Debate Ends 
### DIANE NORBURG 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
completed discussion on its Steering
Committee's proposed resolution on
Evaluation of Teaching, striking a
section which would have encouraged
faculty cooperation with the ASSU
Course Review.
The two-hour discussion followed a
narrow vote of approval for discussion
of the section dealing with evaluation
by students. By a vote of 19 to 17,
senators elected to debate that section
rather than refer some or possibly all
of the section to deans and
department chairmen for their

consideration.
After approving the section's first
statement that "evaluations by
students should be an important
component in procedures of teaching
evaluation," the Senate debated how
systematic or detailed their
recommendations should be. Senators
questioned whether the document —
defined as a "sense of the Senate"
should be viewed as enforceable
legislation or merely as a
recommendation to deans and
departments.
Senate Belief
Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler, Senate parliamentarian,
ruled the document should be viewed
as a "declaration of what the Senate
believes" and is therefore not binding.
The deletion from the document of
the statement concerning faculty
cooperation with the ASSU Course
Review, a published student effort not
formally connected with faculty or
administration, removed the final
point in the student evaluation
section.

A 17 to 15 vote defeated the
recommendation for cooperation after
Assoc. Communication Prof. Henry S.
Breitrose said that although he was
personally in favor of the ASSU
Course Review, he felt that any formal
connection between faculty and the
Review was like having a music critic
belong to the orchestra he criticizes.
Approved Section
The final version of the section on
student evaluation of teaching, as
approved by the Senate, reads:
"Resolved that it is the sense of the
Senate of the Academic Council:
"a. That evaluations by students
should be an important component in
procedures of teaching evaluation;
"b. That every course (considering
each section of a multi-sectioned
course as a separate course) should be
evaluated by students sufficiently
frequently to provide guidance for the
improvement of instruction;
"c. That every faculty member
should have at least one of his or her
courses evaluated by students no less
frequently than every three years;
"d. That a standard questionnaire
approved by the Dean of the School
should be one component of student
evaluation of teaching;
"e. That faculty members should be
encouraged to make extensive use of
the standard questionnaire;
"112. That except as many be
required under the provisions of
Section 1, b., or by policies duly
adopted by the faculties of individual
schools or departments, the release of
the results of student evaluations of
teaching should be at the discretion of
the individual faculty member."
(Section 1, b., concerning
departmental procedures of teaching
evaluation, recommends that student
evaluations should be used by
departments in considering long-term
reappointments or promotions.)
Support Services
A final section of the proposal,
which was approved after minimal
debate, outlines short-term and
long-term goals for teaching evaluation
"support services" by individual
departments, deans and the provost's
office. The plan calls for courses or
other assistance "in teaching methods
