### DENNIS CUFF Second Of Two Farts 
ASSU Vice Presidents Beth Garfield
and Jim Friend plan the establishment
of Little Leland's Pub and new services
for women including a "Women's
Advocate" position as their major
efforts this year.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last spring he would find an
employee in the dean's office to work
part time on women's problems, but
so far he hasn't found anyone who is
qualified, Garfield said. Garfield said
she will meet with Lyons soon to
discuss the matter.
Garfield's other projects include a
Women's Coordinating Committee
(WCC) and the Center for Research on
Women.
The WCC, affiliated with the
Women's Clubhouse, coordinates the

work of women's groups to avoid
duplication of effort, and also to
provide a "united front" in
representing women's interests to the
University, Garfield said.
Academic Interest
The Center for Research on Women
will attempt to increase academic
interest in women on the
scene, Garfield said.
The Center will also make
suggestions to improve courses on
women and introduce new ones.
Meanwhile, Friend and Tresidder
employee Tom Gidwitz, a junior,
worked on the plans for Little
Leland's Pub during the summer. After
writing the proposal and pricing initial
and operating costs, Friend said
President Lyman will take the
proposal to the Trustees for approval.
