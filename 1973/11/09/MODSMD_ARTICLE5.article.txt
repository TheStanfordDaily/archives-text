# Friend, Garfield Plan Pub, Women's Events

### DENNIS CUFF Second Of Two Farts 
ASSU Vice Presidents Beth Garfield
and Jim Friend plan the establishment
of Little Leland's Pub and new services
for women including a "Women's
Advocate" position as their major
efforts this year.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last spring he would find an
employee in the dean's office to work
part time on women's problems, but
so far he hasn't found anyone who is
qualified, Garfield said. Garfield said
she will meet with Lyons soon to
discuss the matter.
Garfield's other projects include a
Women's Coordinating Committee
(WCC) and the Center for Research on
Women.
The WCC, affiliated with the
Women's Clubhouse, coordinates the

work of women's groups to avoid
duplication of effort, and also to
provide a "united front" in
representing women's interests to the
University, Garfield said.
Academic Interest
The Center for Research on Women
will attempt to increase academic
interest in women on the
scene, Garfield said.
The Center will also make
suggestions to improve courses on
women and introduce new ones.
Meanwhile, Friend and Tresidder
employee Tom Gidwitz, a junior,
worked on the plans for Little
Leland's Pub during the summer. After
writing the proposal and pricing initial
and operating costs, Friend said
President Lyman will take the
proposal to the Trustees for approval.
Friend said the most difficult
problem in setting up Little Leland's is
not obtaining the liquor license from
the Alcoholic Beverage Commission
(ABC), but in drawing up the plans.
Friend said he is also trying to
expand Jewish studies and establish a
Jewish theme house.
The University has been
unresponsive so far, Friend said.
"They offered us a trailer, and how
much can you do with a trailer?"
More Than Religion
He disagrees with the University's
argument that granting a Jewish theme
house would be religious
discrimination because "Judaism is a
whole civilization, a culture, not

strictly a religion," he said. Orthodox
Jews cannot maintain their customs
and eat food service meals, Friend
said.
He is also working on the expansion
of the ASSU Course Review and the
publication of a student restaurant
guide, which will review between 60

and 70 restaurants close to the
University.
Friend said he expects the Course
Review to survey twice as many
courses as the 350 it did last year.
Funds for the Review will come
largely from advertising this year.
Friend explained.
