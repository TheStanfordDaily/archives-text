# Women Consider Auto Mechanics Course A Gas
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"You can do a lot if you're willing to get your hands
dirty," Steve Hogel tells his auto mechanics class. About
25 students, mostly women, show up in the Women's
Clubhouse each Tuesday night for the YWCA-sponsored
class.
Although there is little talk of liberation, women in the
class reject the idea that auto mechanics is unladylike.
They are tired of being helpless in the face of simple
mechanical problems.
Diane DeLucchi is taking the course even though she
doesn't own a car. "I came back to school from Denver
with a friend and our car broke down. We spent a lot of
time in a garage in Wells, Nevada. I decided it was time to
learn about cars."
Gerda DeWerk had already helped rebuild a
transmission before she took the course. "I have a car and
I'm tired of asking my brother questions all the time. I
want to know what's going on."
For most class members, auto mechanics is a new
interest. "People bring next to nothing in terms of
knowledge," Hogel says. "Some people have never opened
the hood of their car; they don't know what the battery
is."
No Labs
Students don't work with actual cars in class; this is
not a lab course. They learn from charts, chalk talks and
automobile parts which Hogel brings in each week to
illustrate his lectures. He plans to bring in a complete
engine on a stand later this quarter to show how all the
parts work together.
In a description of the engine's cooling system, Hogel
introduces each part for the benefit of beginners.
"Let's start with the radiator. Everybody has heard of
a radiator. You've seen water dripping out of them
sometimes." Students shake their heads as if to deny ever

having heard of a radiator. Hogel holds up a sample from
his stock of spare parts and explains how it works, what
can go wrong and how to maintain it.
Fan Belt
"You've all driven into gas stations and heard them
say, 'You need a new radiator cap, a new radiator hose
and a fan belt.' Well here's the fan belt." He holds up a
fan belt while diligent students take notes and draw
diagrams.
Hogel urges his students to do simple jobs themselves
to avoid paying high labor costs. He also hopes a
familiarity with mechanics will protect them from
unscrupulous repairmen.
He passes around a good radiator cap and one that is
worn out, telling his students to check for themselves
before they are persuaded to buy a new one. "Gas station
attendants are told that their object is to sell things. My
object is to see that you don't get screwed."
'Full Of Shit'
The majority of mechanics can't be trusted, Hogel
warns. "Sixty percent are full of shit, especially if they
think they can pull the wool over your eyes."
However, he recommends taking a car to a garage
rather than a service station. "Generally, gas stations don't
do superior work. They're not set up for it."
The price of labor is outrageous, Hogel says. A typical
garage charges $18 per hour. The mechanic gets about
one-third of that, while the rest covers shop fees and
overhead. Hogel charges $4 an hour, since he has no
overhead and is not a certified mechanic. He doesn't have
enough time to do all the work he is offered.
"For me it's not a living, it's fun," he says. Hogel
would like to teach auto mechanics professionally, but
currently works as a landscape gardener.
Students pay $8 for the 10-week course. Hogel plans to
teach two classes next quarter — one for beginners and
one for those who already know the basics.

MECHANICAL WOMEN — landscape gardener Steve Hogel doubles as an instructor in auto mechanics for a class
composed largely of women. Hogel will teach two non-credit classes here in auto mechanics next quarter.
