# Dateless Wonder Club
## Local Group Akin To National Realm 
### 
The crisis is over. The President
has resigned.
It is now encumbent on us all
to turn to the important affairs
which have so long been
neglected.
The Dateless Wonder Club has
been cleansed.
In order to restore public
confidence in the Club I offer the
following summary, which has
been verified by Chief Lightfoot.
But before dealing with the crisis
itself, let us review the Club's
history.
The Dateless Wonder Club was
originally conceived by an
oversized pair of freshman
roommates, whom we shall call
Jeff and Mutt.
Mutt was built like a beer
truck, only more solid. He had a
rather sedimentary look, as
though he spent a lot of time
watching wine age.
Jeff reminded one of a tackle
football game, in the street. A suit
on him looked like a motorcycle
jacket.
Mother Wilbur made them
roommates by the scientific
device of matching their heights.
However helpful this was in
preventing some underweight
freshman from being crushed by
an irritated rommate it also
concentrated the two most
intimidating individuals in the
dorm in the same room.
Consequently people tended to
avoid that end of the hall for fear
of being inadvertently trampled.
So, in order to entice people into
talking with them, they estabished
the Dateless Wonder Club. The
requirement for membership was
simple, no dates. Like the Bill of
Rights, this requirement was
deceptively simple and later open
to various interpretations.
Jeff and Mutt immediately
initiated themselves as members
and opened the Club for
applications. It was a case of an
idea whose time had come. The
male population of the third floor
had long been waiting for just
such an opportunity, Norman,
Dick and Harry quickly qualified
for membership.
The Club rapidly became the
social center of the group. Some
of the favorite activities were
standing around at dances, getting
drunk and passing out, making
unkind comments about people in
Chemistry classes, visiting
mailboxes, and most popular of
all, discussing what to do.
During spring quarter the
group lost Harry. He fell in love
and started on the quest of the
Holy Grail. Harry reverted to an
earlier, simpler time and pressed
his case with poetry, roses, and
champagne. His tenderness and

devotion were inspiring to watch;
unfortunately he got zapped
between the eyes.
Harry then applied for
readmission at the end of the year
and was placed on probation. It
was further agreed that activities
during the summer should not
affect the status of members.
The next year the Club started
it's second term. Jeff was
overwhelmingly elected President.
Norman campaigned briefly but
received only his own vote as he
was generally considered to be
unstable.
Harry was reinstated early in
Autumn quarter. This led to
charges that he had received an
unusually light sentence because
of his former position in the club.
A tinge of bitterness was added by
the fact that Harry had always
been a hard-liner concerning
membership requirements and had
thundered against such permissive
practices as classifying study
breaks in a girl's room a date.
But the real controversy
surrounded the President. You
see, part-way through the year
Jeff went on a date, of sorts.
Upon returning from the date Jeff
touched off a constitutional crisis
by asserting he should not be
demembered and that the club
could not vote him out because,
"I am the President."
Jeff based his argument on
three points; 1) he had received a
mandate in the election, 2) he had
only gone on the date for the
good of the Club so as to discover
what the opposition was plotting
3) he didn't really do anything
anyway.
While members were puzzling
over these arguments, Norman, a
journalism student, circulated
rumors from "unnamed sources"
of massive wrong-doing on Jeff's
part. Jeff replied that these were
"vicious, unprincipled, distorted,
biased, rumors from someone for
whom I have no respect."
Suspicions were aroused by
these rumors however, and Jeff at
length agreed to release a
summary of events. In a 15-page
statement he said; "we at no time
held hands, and did not kiss one
another good night. There was
not, at any time, any hanky
panky."
But by now Jeff's credibility
was considerably erroded due to
the continued machinations of
Norman, and the Club demanded
permission to question the girl.
Jeff protested maintaining that
what occurred between a man and
a woman was confidential. He said
he was protecting the privacy of
every couple by refusing to allow
the club to interview the girl.

The club refused to accept this
line of reasoning and set a meeting
date to impeach the erring
President. Jeff, who had been
rooming with Norman, then threw
Norman through a window and
said he was a biased Poo Poo.
The ensuing uproar convinced
Jeff to give permission to
interview the girl. Unfortunately
it was then discovered that she
had transferred.
At this point Norman, who had
just returned from Cowell,
revealed evidence of massive
wrongdoing on the President's
part. He produced a handkerchief
with lipstick on it, witnesses who
had seen Jeff leaving a girl's room

Pete Aleshire

early in the morning, and a tape
recording of a girl's laughter. In
short, Jeff had a girlfriend.
The revelations touched off
outraged reactions. Mutt, who had
previously maintained a glacial
silence, called for immediate
resignation or impeachment. The
Club rose in self-righteous
indignation and voted
overwhelmingly for impeachment.
Jeff, as he was led down the
hall, said they were all pinkos and
would have to find another
kickball.
Norman was unbearably smug.

it's second term. Jeff was
overwhelmingly elected President.
Norman campaigned briefly but
received only his own vote as he
was generally considered to be
unstable.
Harry was reinstated early in
Autumn quarter. This led to
charges that he had received an
unusually light sentence because
of his former position in the club.
A tinge of bitterness was added by
the fact that Harry had always
been a hard-liner concerning
membership requirements and had
thundered against such permissive
practices as classifying study
breaks in a girl's room a date.
But the real controversy
surrounded the President. You
see, part-way through the year
Jeff went on a date, of sorts.
Upon returning from the date Jeff
touched off a constitutional crisis
by asserting he should not be
demembered and that the club
could not vote him out because,
"I am the President."
Jeff based his argument on
three points; 1) he had received a
mandate in the election, 2) he had
only gone on the date for the
good of the Club so as to discover
what the opposition was plotting
3) he didn't really do anything
anyway.
While members were puzzling
over these arguments, Norman, a
journalism student, circulated
rumors from "unnamed sources"
of massive wrong-doing on Jeff's
part. Jeff replied that these were
"vicious, unprincipled, distorted,
biased, rumors from someone for
whom I have no respect."
Suspicions were aroused by
these rumors however, and Jeff at
length agreed to release a
summary of events. In a 15-page
statement he said; "we at no time
held hands, and did not kiss one
another good night. There was
not, at any time, any hanky
panky."
But by now Jeff's credibility
was considerably erroded due to
the continued machinations of
Norman, and the Club demanded
permission to question the girl.
Jeff protested maintaining that
what occurred between a man and
a woman was confidential. He said
he was protecting the privacy of
every couple by refusing to allow
the club to interview the girl.

The club refused to accept this
line of reasoning and set a meeting
date to impeach the erring
President. Jeff, who had been
rooming with Norman, then threw
Norman through a window and
said he was a biased Poo Poo.
The ensuing uproar convinced
Jeff to give permission to
interview the girl. Unfortunately
it was then discovered that she
had transferred.
At this point Norman, who had
just returned from Cowell,
revealed evidence of massive
wrongdoing on the President's
part. He produced a handkerchief
with lipstick on it, witnesses who
had seen Jeff leaving a girl's room

Pete Aleshire

early in the morning, and a tape
recording of a girl's laughter. In
short, Jeff had a girlfriend.
The revelations touched off
outraged reactions. Mutt, who had
previously maintained a glacial
silence, called for immediate
resignation or impeachment. The
Club rose in self-righteous
indignation and voted
overwhelmingly for impeachment.
Jeff, as he was led down the
hall, said they were all pinkos and
would have to find another
kickball.
Norman was unbearably smug.

The crisis is over. The President
has resigned.
It is now encumbent on us all
to turn to the important affairs
which have so long been
neglected.
The Dateless Wonder Club has
been cleansed.
In order to restore public
confidence in the Club I offer the
following summary, which has
been verified by Chief Lightfoot.
But before dealing with the crisis
itself, let us review the Club's
history.
The Dateless Wonder Club was
originally conceived by an
oversized pair of freshman
roommates, whom we shall call
Jeff and Mutt.
Mutt was built like a beer
truck, only more solid. He had a
rather sedimentary look, as
though he spent a lot of time
watching wine age.
Jeff reminded one of a tackle
football game, in the street. A suit
on him looked like a motorcycle
jacket.
Mother Wilbur made them
roommates by the scientific
device of matching their heights.
However helpful this was in
preventing some underweight
freshman from being crushed by
an irritated rommate it also
concentrated the two most
intimidating individuals in the
dorm in the same room.
Consequently people tended to
avoid that end of the hall for fear
of being inadvertently trampled.
So, in order to entice people into
talking with them, they estabished
the Dateless Wonder Club. The
requirement for membership was
simple, no dates. Like the Bill of
Rights, this requirement was
deceptively simple and later open
to various interpretations.
Jeff and Mutt immediately
initiated themselves as members
and opened the Club for
applications. It was a case of an
idea whose time had come. The
male population of the third floor
had long been waiting for just
such an opportunity, Norman,
Dick and Harry quickly qualified
for membership.
The Club rapidly became the
social center of the group. Some
of the favorite activities were
standing around at dances, getting
drunk and passing out, making
unkind comments about people in
Chemistry classes, visiting
mailboxes, and most popular of
all, discussing what to do.
During spring quarter the
group lost Harry. He fell in love
and started on the quest of the
Holy Grail. Harry reverted to an
earlier, simpler time and pressed
his case with poetry, roses, and
champagne. His tenderness and

devotion were inspiring to watch;
unfortunately he got zapped
between the eyes.
Harry then applied for
readmission at the end of the year
and was placed on probation. It
was further agreed that activities
during the summer should not
affect the status of members.
The next year the Club started
it's second term. Jeff was
overwhelmingly elected President.
Norman campaigned briefly but
received only his own vote as he
was generally considered to be
unstable.

The crisis is over. The President
has resigned.
It is now encumbent on us all
to turn to the important affairs
which have so long been
neglected.
The Dateless Wonder Club has
been cleansed.
In order to restore public
confidence in the Club I offer the
following summary, which has
been verified by Chief Lightfoot.
But before dealing with the crisis
itself, let us review the Club's
history.
The Dateless Wonder Club was
originally conceived by an
oversized pair of freshman
roommates, whom we shall call
Jeff and Mutt.
Mutt was built like a beer
truck, only more solid. He had a
rather sedimentary look, as
though he spent a lot of time
watching wine age.
Jeff reminded one of a tackle
football game, in the street. A suit
on him looked like a motorcycle
jacket.
Mother Wilbur made them
roommates by the scientific
device of matching their heights.
However helpful this was in
preventing some underweight
freshman from being crushed by
an irritated rommate it also
concentrated the two most
intimidating individuals in the
dorm in the same room.
Consequently people tended to
avoid that end of the hall for fear
of being inadvertently trampled.
So, in order to entice people into
talking with them, they estabished
the Dateless Wonder Club. The
requirement for membership was
simple, no dates. Like the Bill of
Rights, this requirement was
deceptively simple and later open
to various interpretations.
Jeff and Mutt immediately
initiated themselves as members
and opened the Club for
applications. It was a case of an
idea whose time had come. The
male population of the third floor
had long been waiting for just
such an opportunity, Norman,
Dick and Harry quickly qualified
for membership.
The Club rapidly became the
social center of the group. Some
of the favorite activities were
standing around at dances, getting
drunk and passing out, making
unkind comments about people in
Chemistry classes, visiting
mailboxes, and most popular of
all, discussing what to do.
During spring quarter the
group lost Harry. He fell in love
and started on the quest of the
Holy Grail. Harry reverted to an
earlier, simpler time and pressed
his case with poetry, roses, and
champagne. His tenderness and

devotion were inspiring to watch;
unfortunately he got zapped
between the eyes.
Harry then applied for
readmission at the end of the year
and was placed on probation. It
was further agreed that activities
during the summer should not
affect the status of members.
The next year the Club started
it's second term. Jeff was
overwhelmingly elected President.
Norman campaigned briefly but
received only his own vote as he
was generally considered to be
unstable.
Harry was reinstated early in
Autumn quarter. This led to
charges that he had received an
unusually light sentence because
of his former position in the club.
A tinge of bitterness was added by
the fact that Harry had always
been a hard-liner concerning
membership requirements and had
thundered against such permissive
practices as classifying study
breaks in a girl's room a date.
But the real controversy
surrounded the President. You
see, part-way through the year
Jeff went on a date, of sorts.
Upon returning from the date Jeff
touched off a constitutional crisis
by asserting he should not be
demembered and that the club
could not vote him out because,
"I am the President."
Jeff based his argument on
three points; 1) he had received a
mandate in the election, 2) he had
only gone on the date for the
good of the Club so as to discover
what the opposition was plotting
3) he didn't really do anything
anyway.
While members were puzzling
over these arguments, Norman, a
journalism student, circulated
rumors from "unnamed sources"
of massive wrong-doing on Jeff's
part. Jeff replied that these were
"vicious, unprincipled, distorted,
biased, rumors from someone for
whom I have no respect."
Suspicions were aroused by
these rumors however, and Jeff at
length agreed to release a
summary of events. In a 15-page
statement he said; "we at no time
held hands, and did not kiss one
another good night. There was
not, at any time, any hanky
panky."
But by now Jeff's credibility
was considerably erroded due to
the continued machinations of
Norman, and the Club demanded
permission to question the girl.
Jeff protested maintaining that
what occurred between a man and
a woman was confidential. He said
he was protecting the privacy of
every couple by refusing to allow
the club to interview the girl.

The club refused to accept this
line of reasoning and set a meeting
date to impeach the erring
President. Jeff, who had been
rooming with Norman, then threw
Norman through a window and
said he was a biased Poo Poo.
The ensuing uproar convinced
Jeff to give permission to
interview the girl. Unfortunately
it was then discovered that she
had transferred.
At this point Norman, who had
just returned from Cowell,
revealed evidence of massive
wrongdoing on the President's
part. He produced a handkerchief
with lipstick on it, witnesses who
