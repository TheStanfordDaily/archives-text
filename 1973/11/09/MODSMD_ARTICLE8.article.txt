A Different Israel
Editor:
Having recently returned from
a four month sabbatical in Israel, I
found that I recognized very little
in the articles by Jonathan
Marshall (Daily, October 29-30,
1973). I wonder where he traveled
and to whom he spoke to write so
authoritatively of conditions in
Israel?
I found a society with
problems — trying to assimilate
people from very different
cultural backgrounds, and labor
problems most reminiscent of
Great Britain (one of the few
other countries where socialism
and representative government try
to coexist). The "Garrison State"
seems to consist of every
able-bodied male being in the
army or at least in the reserves.
Domestically, their major role
seems to be hitchhiking to and
from camp on weekends. I have
yet to meet an Israeli who feels
oppressed by his army. The
celebrated "Black Panthers"
consisted of a handful of young
men camping out in a shabby
lean-to in a park in central Tel
Aviv and were treated by the
passing masses with the shrugged
shoulders and smiles one reserves
for adolescents. This does not
deny the social conflicts between
Jews from western and eastern
countries, but the Black Panthers
"ain't where it's at."
Treatment of Arabs in Israel is
more complex, but the fact that
over 40,000 Arabs migrate into
Israel from the West Bank and
Gaza daily to work, and the
existence of open bridges between
Israel and Jordan, suggest that the
picture of repression painted by
Mr. Marshall is misinformed.
With regard to expansionism
and boundaries, as one Israeli
kibbutznik living under the
shadow of the Golan Heights told
me, "I can live with anybody. If
there is peace, the Syrians can
even have the Heights. But I don't
want my children's home shelled
again as it was in April 1967."
It seems to me Mr. Marshall has
not addressed himself to the basic
question. Has any Arab
government said in words that it is
willing to accept the existence of
Israel's independence? Beyond
that, how is the enlightened
self-interest of the Arab countries
served by their present policies?
What do Egypt and Syria gain by
these wars and this hostility? If it
were to protect their Palestinian
brothers, why did they let them
rot in those camps for twenty-five
years rather than taking in their
brothers, as Israel did the Jews
from Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, Syria
and Morocco after 1948?
In short, I don't understand
Mr. Marshall's point of view and
his perception of reality. Of

course, if he is one of those that
sees the United States as a
repressive dictatorship run by a
fascist government, then his
interpretationsof Israeli society in
the terms used in his articles may
be reasonably consistent.

Ms. O'Laughlin (Daily Nov. 5)
asks us all not to use
"benevolent" in front of
"genocide," because genocide is
always bad. Quite right of her,
and while we're tidying up, could
we push it a little further?
Hitler killed half the Jews of
Europe. Had he succeeded in his
plans, it would certainly have
been genocide. As it stands, it was
plausibly genocide. Decimating
the population of North Vietnam
was possibly genocide.
But how could a social
proposal, such as Shockley's on
sterilization, conceivably be called
genocide when it does not involve
the death of a single person? I am
not supporting Shockley's
proposals here; just drawing
attention to rampant nonsense.
If someone argues at this point
that, even if no one was killed, the
sterilization of all the
poor/unintelligent would be the
death of a race as such, then I
have to point out that (a) no one
has suggested doing it anyway,
and (b) even if such an absurd
program were carried out, it
would not be the death of a race,
unless the poor constitute a race
by definition.
It would not, most certainly,
be the end of the black race in
America (even accidentally, as it
were, since the majority of the
poor are white), unless it is
assumed that all or most blacks
are poor. That is not only a racist
assumption but, more
importantly, false.
But to return to common

Having recently returned from
a four month sabbatical in Israel, I
found that I recognized very little
in the articles by Jonathan
Marshall (Daily, October 29-30,
1973). I wonder where he traveled
and to whom he spoke to write so
authoritatively of conditions in
Israel?
I found a society with
problems — trying to assimilate
people from very different
cultural backgrounds, and labor
problems most reminiscent of
Great Britain (one of the few
other countries where socialism
and representative government try
to coexist). The "Garrison State"
seems to consist of every
able-bodied male being in the
army or at least in the reserves.
Domestically, their major role
seems to be hitchhiking to and
from camp on weekends. I have
yet to meet an Israeli who feels
oppressed by his army. The
celebrated "Black Panthers"
consisted of a handful of young
men camping out in a shabby
lean-to in a park in central Tel
Aviv and were treated by the
passing masses with the shrugged
shoulders and smiles one reserves
for adolescents. This does not
deny the social conflicts between
Jews from western and eastern
countries, but the Black Panthers
"ain't where it's at."
Treatment of Arabs in Israel is
more complex, but the fact that
over 40,000 Arabs migrate into
Israel from the West Bank and
Gaza daily to work, and the
existence of open bridges between
Israel and Jordan, suggest that the
picture of repression painted by
Mr. Marshall is misinformed.
With regard to expansionism
and boundaries, as one Israeli
kibbutznik living under the
shadow of the Golan Heights told
me, "I can live with anybody. If
there is peace, the Syrians can
even have the Heights. But I don't
want my children's home shelled
again as it was in April 1967."
It seems to me Mr. Marshall has
not addressed himself to the basic
question. Has any Arab
government said in words that it is
willing to accept the existence of
Israel's independence? Beyond
that, how is the enlightened
self-interest of the Arab countries
served by their present policies?
What do Egypt and Syria gain by
these wars and this hostility? If it
were to protect their Palestinian
brothers, why did they let them
rot in those camps for twenty-five
years rather than taking in their
brothers, as Israel did the Jews
from Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, Syria
and Morocco after 1948?
In short, I don't understand
Mr. Marshall's point of view and
his perception of reality. Of

course, if he is one of those that
sees the United States as a
repressive dictatorship run by a
fascist government, then his
interpretationsof Israeli society in
the terms used in his articles may
be reasonably consistent.
