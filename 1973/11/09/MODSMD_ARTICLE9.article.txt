# Asian-Americans: Take Action
## Seek Identity In America 
### 
(WRITER'S NOTE: The following
remarks are from one (and I shall
explain the use of the word,)
"Chinaman's" perspective, but
before beginning let me state that
whenever the word Asian" is
used, it indicates that the context
in which it is employed may be
applicable to other people's of
Asian ancestry living in the United
States.)
With the advent of the
n i ne tee n-se ve nt ies the
Asian-American experience has
reached a particularly crucial stage
of development. On one hand,
gone is the overtly racist,
systematic discrimination of
Asians in the United States.
On the other hand, increasing
numbers of Asian-Americans are
entering colleges, obtaining more
glamorous jobs, and moving into
higher priced residential areas.
Nevertheless, while this number
has grown so have the ghettos
from which many of our parents
have moved out. It is obvious that
Asian-Americans still face today
very real social, political, and
economic problems. Many of
which find their expression even
at a place such as Stanford.
Was Betty L. Sung's statement
in her much-lauded, Mountain of
Gold, correct in asserting: "They
[the Chinese] were never overly
bitter. They have gone into
occupations which command
respect and which lessen conflict
from competition. . .Perhaps
someone should have reminded
Ms. Sung that the majority of us
were neither then, nor are today
engineers, physicists, doctors,
chemists, etc., but rather people
who did jobs whites (especially
white men) would not touch, e.g.
THE LAUNDRY.
This stereotype has helped one
segment of Asians "lift themselves
up by their own bootstraps" while
stepping down on the heads of
others who are lower on the
American social ladder. All too

frequently these have been fellow
Asian-Americans. We have paid a
psychological as well as a political
price by claiming "Chinoisery" as
our sole preserve — industry,
honesty, frugality, and patience —
of which Grant Ave. is a supreme
expression.
Torn Psyches
But my primary concern is for
the Asian-Americans at Stanford,
many of whom will eventually, if
not now, experience the shredded
psyche that seems to be the legacy
of three, or even seven,
generations of life in North
America.
A significant number of us
come from middle to upper
income families: many of these
families live quite far from the
nearest Asian community. As the
fervor of the anti-war movement
has cooled so has the initial vigor
of the Asian-American Movement.
The draft no longer hangs over
our heads, and likewise, neither
does the prospect of shooting
"gooks" and "dinks" appear so
horrible. It was interesting for me
to note as a freshman last year
that as the identification with our
brothers and sisters of Southeast
Asia lessened, the symbiosis with
the Community disappeared.
Specifically, we have returned
to our "book thing." (That
applies to all majors.) On campus
there is now a "theme house" to
appease the more
identity-conscious ones among us
with its attendant opportunities
for socializing. Concerning the
world off-campus we hear
occasionally that some
organization has successfully
lobbied for the flow of some
anti- poverty funds into some
Asian ghetto.
New Alliances
The Community is no longer
pertinent to our families, except
as a place to eat and shop.
Instead, like our white friends we
look directly to China (the

fashionable one), hoping for the
day that we too will be able to
vacation and see relatives in the
land of "Maoism" and
anti-imperialism.
It is time for Asian-American
students to start thinking. We
need to ask to what extent will
our lives be affected by the
existence or non-existence, the
success and failure, of those living
in the real Asian cultural centers
and not the slick monuments to
Taiwan or Japan, Inc.
We are the ones who have been
furnished and/or have earned the
money to attend Stanford. The
University is our stepping stone
towards creating that good and
decent life for ourselves and our
families. We have the time to
discuss, compose, and evaluate
statements such as this. I hope
some action, however small, will
grow out of this process.
Identity As Chinaman
To rush out into the
Community to work holds no
mystical prospects of solutions.
Community work may come later.
I have my own life, but I also
recognize that I am a Chinaman.
Whole destines and psychologies
are tied up in words. Chinamen.
The word was never derogatory,
never an object of silent self-hate
until my precursors hit these
shores.
It was how we were first
referred to in this country before
the shooting's and the lynchings
and is essentially what we still are.
(Our sansei brothers received a
like reminder of what they still
are to certain segments of
America; counsel Charles E.
Wilson's reference to Senator
Daniel Inouye illustrated this.)
Call me a Chinaman, only
realize that I'm proud to be one. I
have hung in there for sixty-nine
installments of Charlie Chan and
will probably continue to do so
for forty more of Kung Fu. Been
here since 1848, Longtime
Californ', the first ninety-five
years were the hardest. Better yet,
since everyone must live with
labels and larger slots of
classification, call me
Asian-American.
America Is Home
Patience can't be assumed
anymore, or piety for that matter.
My culture isn't a bowl of rice; it
is the label on the bottom of the
thick, dull porcelain that reads:
MADE IN JAPAN. My tradition is
the rice itself, which comes to me
in a fifty-pound sack marked:
TEXAS LONG GRAIN. My
history is wearing a badge marked,
"I am Chinese," while other
yellow men and women are
shipped off to a New Mexico
wasteland. My literary tradition is
scratched on the walls of the
former immigration buildings on
Angel Island; poems written at the
gateway to Gum San, bitter
poems I may never see.
Asian-American, I like it for
now. The term is still in the
process of definition, like a
chinaman aesthetic. The hyphen is
still there, and Asian isn't really
explicit, but it reminds me of the
reality of this country and of my
unity with my brothers and
sisters. The badges are hopefully
resting in the compost pile of
American social history.
Evaluate Alternatives
What can we do? Simply
consider the options open to us
once the expensive mind exercises
in college are over. Recognize that
the time has come for technician
mentalities to ask what is to be
done and why. It takes a large
degree of personal daring to begin
creating some real input for the
Community. It is even harder to
possess any notion of a genuine
Asian-American sensibility in the
grab for the almighty money bags.
In the meantime we do have
the means to act right here on
campus. They range from
educating Stanford about us, e.g.
the upcoming Asian-American
radio program on KZSU, to
working in the People's Teahouse
in Wilbur. Of course, Community
work is not to be ruled out so
long as we avoid proclaiming
ourselves as missionaries. Our
future is neither totally in Asia
nor America, but in our "root"
communities. With that
realization, we may be able to
build a socially and economically
healthy entity in the United
States.
