Professors Jim Adams
Could you design a gadget to receive a
golf ball "here," process it through five
amusingly different phases and deliver it
"there" exactly 60 seconds later? How
would you build an all-directional ve
hide? Professors Jim Adams and Bob
fIA -v McKim will attempt to remove your
( \ "Blocks to Creativity" in their Tuesday
p Evening Lecture. Engineers and artists
who couple design with aesthetics to
meet the exigencies of human need, Pro
lessors Adams and McKim are two of the
£ ' most popular professors in the Depart
ij ftA ~ ment of Mechanical Engineering. Come
i.and engage in some conceptual block
: jPyjC busting. Rigid thinking and problem solv
.r jing are antipathetic bedmates.
