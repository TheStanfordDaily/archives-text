# Delt Residents Have A Home
## Stillman Ready At Last 
### DON COX 
Students displaced from their
assigned housing in the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity by Stillman house
construction delays, were finally able
to move into the house Saturday.
Residents of Columbae, the
non-violence theme house had been
living in the Delt house since
September because of delays in the
relocation of the new Columbae house
(formerly Stillman-Grove house).
The Delt house was vacant because
of the expulsion of fraternity members
from the house for at least a year last
May following numerous complaints
of misconduct from neighboring
houses.
Stillman house was moved to make
room for the planned Campus Drive
rerouting. While it was originally to
have been ready for occupancy at the
beginning of the quarter, construction
delays repeatedly pushed back the
occupancy date.
♦Drag'
"It's been a drag waiting around all
quarter and going through midterms
with nowhere to live," said one Delt
resident. "The room was worth
waiting for though," he said as he
stared out of the window at the view
of the campus and the bay.
Others "are so glad to get in here
they don't care what they got in the
way of a room or view," noted one
Delt coed.
Delt residents had been forced to
live off-campus or in temporary
University housing. Some stayed in the
guest rooms in dorms while others
slept on the floors of friends' rooms or
trailers.
Columbae residents were told last
Wednesday to move out of the Delt
house by Saturday and most did not
move until Friday afternoon. "It's

incredible the way everyone moved
out in one afternoon," said Brian Farr
of Columbae. Students hurried to keep
ahead of the "invasion of maids''
cleaning up the Delt house. "It's
probably the first time the house has
been clean all quarter," remarked one
student.
Columbae Residents Glad
Columbae residents were also glad
to be able to finally move into their
house.
"I was horrified to think that I
would be moving here two weeks ago,
but they've done a pretty good job
fixing the house," said one Columbae
coed.
Most other house members
remained skeptical, since painters were
still at work upstairs as they moved in
and the yard was a muddy mess. "I
don't like living with working parties
the rest of the quarter," said
Columbae resident Allison Mull.
Columbae residents also had to put
up with construction crews in the Delt
house up until two weeks ago. The
house was remodeled over the summer
and the work carried over into this
quarter — some floors and walls still
remain unfinished.
Painting Finished Soon
Joe Stewart, assistant plant
manager supervisor, said that the
painting in the Columbae house would
be finished "within a couple days next
week." He conjectured that the front
porch and the outside work "won't
take very long" if the weather is good.
Many residents were still somewhat
bitter or disappointed toward the
University. "They really bungled the
whole thing over the summer," said
junior Chuck Pike.
Pike was happy, though, with the
reduction in rent the university gave
the Columbae residents while they

were in the Delt house. "However, it
doesn't seem fair to have to pay full
rent in Stillman until the work is done
there," he added.
'Injustice'
Brian Farr, while somewhat
irritated over the inconveniences, said,
"The real injustice is to the people
that are going to live in the Delt
house." Farr, while leery of the
"nursery school paint job," noted that
"it was nice to get down" to a less
isolated area because he "hardly saw
anyone up at the Delt house."
As for the impact on the living
groups, opinion was varied. While
some residents felt that the experience
would have a unifying effect, Pike
noted that "it was always hanging over
our heads. We could never schedule
many house activities very far in
advance on the chance that that might
be the day we were told to move."

house.
"I was horrified to think that I
would be moving here two weeks ago,
but they've done a pretty good job
fixing the house," said one Columbae
coed.
Most other house members
remained skeptical, since painters were
still at work upstairs as they moved in
and the yard was a muddy mess. "I
don't like living with working parties
the rest of the quarter," said
Columbae resident Allison Mull.
Columbae residents also had to put
up with construction crews in the Delt
house up until two weeks ago. The
house was remodeled over the summer
and the work carried over into this
quarter — some floors and walls still
remain unfinished.
Painting Finished Soon
Joe Stewart, assistant plant
manager supervisor, said that the
painting in the Columbae house would
be finished "within a couple days next
week." He conjectured that the front
porch and the outside work "won't
take very long" if the weather is good.
Many residents were still somewhat
bitter or disappointed toward the
University. "They really bungled the
whole thing over the summer," said
junior Chuck Pike.
Pike was happy, though, with the
reduction in rent the university gave
the Columbae residents while they

were in the Delt house. "However, it
doesn't seem fair to have to pay full
rent in Stillman until the work is done
there," he added.
'Injustice'
Brian Farr, while somewhat
irritated over the inconveniences, said,
"The real injustice is to the people
that are going to live in the Delt
house." Farr, while leery of the
"nursery school paint job," noted that
"it was nice to get down" to a less
isolated area because he "hardly saw
anyone up at the Delt house."
As for the impact on the living
groups, opinion was varied. While
some residents felt that the experience
would have a unifying effect, Pike
noted that "it was always hanging over
our heads. We could never schedule
many house activities very far in
advance on the chance that that might
be the day we were told to move."

MOVING DAY — Friday arid Saturday were the long-awaited moving days for
residents of Columbae and the Delt house. While Stillman was being relocated,
Columbae people occupied the Delt house, forcing Delt residents to accept
temporary housing.
Students displaced from their
assigned housing in the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity by Stillman house
construction delays, were finally able
to move into the house Saturday.
Residents of Columbae, the
non-violence theme house had been
living in the Delt house since
September because of delays in the
relocation of the new Columbae house
(formerly Stillman-Grove house).
The Delt house was vacant because
of the expulsion of fraternity members
from the house for at least a year last
May following numerous complaints
of misconduct from neighboring
houses.
Stillman house was moved to make
room for the planned Campus Drive
rerouting. While it was originally to
have been ready for occupancy at the
beginning of the quarter, construction
delays repeatedly pushed back the
occupancy date.
♦Drag'
"It's been a drag waiting around all
quarter and going through midterms
with nowhere to live," said one Delt
resident. "The room was worth
waiting for though," he said as he
stared out of the window at the view
of the campus and the bay.
Others "are so glad to get in here
they don't care what they got in the
way of a room or view," noted one
Delt coed.
Delt residents had been forced to
live off-campus or in temporary
University housing. Some stayed in the
guest rooms in dorms while others
slept on the floors of friends' rooms or
trailers.
Columbae residents were told last
Wednesday to move out of the Delt
house by Saturday and most did not
move until Friday afternoon. "It's

incredible the way everyone moved
out in one afternoon," said Brian Farr
of Columbae. Students hurried to keep
ahead of the "invasion of maids''
cleaning up the Delt house. "It's
probably the first time the house has
been clean all quarter," remarked one
student.
