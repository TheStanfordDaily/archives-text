# Friendship Quietly Escalates
## U.S. Expands Ties With South Africa 
### 
Jonathan Marshall

Despite the flamboyance of
Nixon's diplomacy in the Middle
East, American foreign policy
moves more quietly — and often
with greater efficiency — in other
parts of the world. A good case in
point is South Africa, where the
U.S. is covertly expanding its
military ties with the white
supremacist government.
The Administration must move
quietly because of the potentially
fierce opposition it would face
around the world, in Congress,

and from numerous concerned
religious groups in the United
States. World opinion is evidenced
in U.N. sanctions against South
Africa, including the 1963 arms
embargo, and by the small
number of countries that still
recognize the government of
South Africa (only 23, including
the U.S., still maintain full
diplomatic relations with
Johannesburg).
Worldwide criticism, of course,
is directed against the official
policy of apartheid practiced in
South Africa. Whites make up
only 19 percent of the
population, they receive 75
percent of the national income.
On average, Whites earn about
12 times the wages of blacks for
similar jobs, and the gap is
widening. In mining, for example,
the wage differential has risen
from 11.7 in 1911 to 17.0 in
1961 to 20.1 in 1969. Real
earnings for blacks have not risen
since 1911; in fact, they fell
throughout the economy as a
whole nearly 30 percent from
1950 to the present.
Bare Subsistance Level
Eighty percent of South
Africa's blacks live below the
official "Poverty Datum Line"
which measures the bare
subsistance level possible for the
average black family.
Despite UN sanctions, the
United States refuses to break its
ties with the South African
regime. Besides granting full
diplomatic recognition, the
United States supports the regime
with aid to the South African
military, shipping vitally needed
spare parts and supplying "civilian
type" planes to its air force.
Pentagon spokesmen have

specifically reserved the right to
ship other arms to South Africa
"in an effort to protect world
peace and security." The U.S.also
supports the South African
government economically by
granting it special trade
preferences for its sugar exports,
which we deny to Cuba.
Why does the Nixon
Administration insist on keeping
friendly ties with South Africa?
The answer lies in the nature of
America's economic relationship
with that country. Thanks to a
healthy investment climate
provided especially for foreign
firms and cheap and docile labor
force, over 300 multinational
corporations based in the United
States have set up operations in
South Africa.
Billions Invested
These include such giants
(politically as well as
economically) as Chase Manhattan
Bank, Chrysler, Citicorp, Ford,
GM, IBM, ITT, Standard Oil of
California, and EXXON, along
with many others from the
Fortune 500. These companies
have invested more than a billion
dollars in the South African status
quo. Since they earn an average
18.6 percent on their capital
(compared to an average 11
percent elsewhere), American
businessmen value their
investments there.
The U.S. is also interested in
maintaining a stable, pro-Western
government in South Africa to
take advantage of that country's
vast mineral wealth. South Africa
supplies the world (or rather,
those countries that trade with it)
with vast quantities of chromium,
diamonds, gold, platinum,
uranium, and other strategic

minerals vital to the US economy.
Strategic Location
At least as important to the U.S.
is South Africa's strategic
position. The Johannesburg
government is spending $45
million to expand its already
formidable harbor at Simonstown
at the tip of the Cap of Good
Hope for use by its Navy. As
Armed Forces Journal has pointed
out, South Africa "occupies a
strategic location astride
approaches to the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans with one of the
best equipped naval bases in the
Souther Hemisphere."
The magazine, which describes
its 30,000 subscribers as "mostly
high level professionals in the
military, the DoD, in Congress,
and in the defense industries,"
openly argues for "firm, open ties
with the 'gatekeeper' to the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans." One
reason that the U.S. military is so
anxious to retain control of these
sea lanes is that they carry over
half a million tons of petroleum
to the West each day, largely from
Iran. As a point of access into the
Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf,
the Cape of Good Hope is a key
location.
The Nixon Administration, it
was revealed only a month ago, is
now significantly expanding its
military ties with South Africa by
coordinating with the Vorster
government the operation of a
$21 million "communications
complex" sunk into the lower
slopes of a mountain near Cape
Town, designed to provide the U.S.
with secret intelligence on world
shipping in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Possible Concrete Evidence
"If true," writes Tom
Engelhardt for Pacific News
Service, "it would be the first
hard evidence of increased
military ties between the US and
South Africa's tough white
supremacist government — and a
potential diplomatic bombshell in
much of the world."
Sophisticated electronics
equipment within the
communications center already
keeps track of ship movements for
thousands of miles around, and,
according to Armed Forces
Journal, "can flash these ship
plottings to war rooms in the U.S
andU.K.in seconds."
The United States already
relies on South African tracking
stations to monitor its space
launches (including spy satellites).
South African mercenaries have
rescued U.S.backed forces in tight
situations in the Congo (1964)
and are now shoring up Portugal's
crumbling hold on her African
colonies — a move supported by
this Administration. The report of
secret military ties between the
United States and South Africa in
the new Cape Town
communications complex should
come as no surprise, but it does
represent a new level in the
escalating friendship between the
Nixon Administration and its
allies in Johannesburg.

Nixon's diplomacy in the Middle
East, American foreign policy
moves more quietly — and often
with greater efficiency — in other
parts of the world. A good case in
point is South Africa, where the
U.S. is covertly expanding its
military ties with the white
supremacist government.
The Administration must move
quietly because of the potentially
fierce opposition it would face
around the world, in Congress,

and from numerous concerned
religious groups in the United
States. World opinion is evidenced
in U.N. sanctions against South
Africa, including the 1963 arms
embargo, and by the small
number of countries that still
recognize the government of
South Africa (only 23, including
the U.S., still maintain full
diplomatic relations with
Johannesburg).
Worldwide criticism, of course,
is directed against the official
policy of apartheid practiced in
South Africa. Whites make up
only 19 percent of the
population, they receive 75
percent of the national income.
On average, Whites earn about
12 times the wages of blacks for
similar jobs, and the gap is
widening. In mining, for example,
the wage differential has risen
from 11.7 in 1911 to 17.0 in
1961 to 20.1 in 1969. Real
earnings for blacks have not risen
since 1911; in fact, they fell
throughout the economy as a
whole nearly 30 percent from
1950 to the present.
Bare Subsistance Level
Eighty percent of South
Africa's blacks live below the
official "Poverty Datum Line"
which measures the bare
subsistance level possible for the
average black family.
Despite UN sanctions, the
United States refuses to break its
ties with the South African
regime. Besides granting full
diplomatic recognition, the
United States supports the regime
with aid to the South African
military, shipping vitally needed
spare parts and supplying "civilian
type" planes to its air force.
Pentagon spokesmen have

specifically reserved the right to
ship other arms to South Africa
"in an effort to protect world
peace and security." The U.S.also
supports the South African
government economically by
granting it special trade
preferences for its sugar exports,
which we deny to Cuba.
Why does the Nixon
Administration insist on keeping
friendly ties with South Africa?
The answer lies in the nature of
America's economic relationship
with that country. Thanks to a
healthy investment climate
provided especially for foreign
firms and cheap and docile labor
force, over 300 multinational
corporations based in the United
States have set up operations in
South Africa.
Billions Invested
These include such giants
(politically as well as
economically) as Chase Manhattan
Bank, Chrysler, Citicorp, Ford,
GM, IBM, ITT, Standard Oil of
California, and EXXON, along
with many others from the
Fortune 500. These companies
have invested more than a billion
dollars in the South African status
quo. Since they earn an average
18.6 percent on their capital
(compared to an average 11
percent elsewhere), American
businessmen value their
investments there.
The U.S. is also interested in
maintaining a stable, pro-Western
government in South Africa to
take advantage of that country's
vast mineral wealth. South Africa
supplies the world (or rather,
those countries that trade with it)
with vast quantities of chromium,
diamonds, gold, platinum,
uranium, and other strategic

minerals vital to the US economy.
Strategic Location
At least as important to the U.S.
is South Africa's strategic
position. The Johannesburg
government is spending $45
million to expand its already
formidable harbor at Simonstown
at the tip of the Cap of Good
Hope for use by its Navy. As
Armed Forces Journal has pointed
out, South Africa "occupies a
strategic location astride
approaches to the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans with one of the
best equipped naval bases in the
Souther Hemisphere."
The magazine, which describes
its 30,000 subscribers as "mostly
high level professionals in the
military, the DoD, in Congress,
and in the defense industries,"
openly argues for "firm, open ties
with the 'gatekeeper' to the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans." One
reason that the U.S. military is so
anxious to retain control of these
sea lanes is that they carry over
half a million tons of petroleum
to the West each day, largely from
Iran. As a point of access into the
Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf,
the Cape of Good Hope is a key
location.
The Nixon Administration, it
was revealed only a month ago, is
now significantly expanding its
military ties with South Africa by
coordinating with the Vorster
government the operation of a
$21 million "communications
complex" sunk into the lower
slopes of a mountain near Cape
Town, designed to provide the U.S.
with secret intelligence on world
shipping in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Possible Concrete Evidence
"If true," writes Tom
Engelhardt for Pacific News
Service, "it would be the first
hard evidence of increased
military ties between the US and
South Africa's tough white
supremacist government — and a
potential diplomatic bombshell in
much of the world."
Sophisticated electronics
equipment within the
communications center already
keeps track of ship movements for
thousands of miles around, and,
according to Armed Forces
Journal, "can flash these ship
plottings to war rooms in the U.S
andU.K.in seconds."
The United States already
relies on South African tracking
stations to monitor its space
launches (including spy satellites).
South African mercenaries have
rescued U.S.backed forces in tight
situations in the Congo (1964)
and are now shoring up Portugal's
crumbling hold on her African
colonies — a move supported by
this Administration. The report of
secret military ties between the
United States and South Africa in
the new Cape Town
communications complex should
come as no surprise, but it does
represent a new level in the
escalating friendship between the
Nixon Administration and its
allies in Johannesburg.

with greater efficiency — in other
parts of the world. A good case in
point is South Africa, where the
U.S. is covertly expanding its
military ties with the white
supremacist government.
The Administration must move
quietly because of the potentially
fierce opposition it would face
around the world, in Congress,

and from numerous concerned
religious groups in the United
States. World opinion is evidenced
in U.N. sanctions against South
Africa, including the 1963 arms
embargo, and by the small
number of countries that still
recognize the government of
South Africa (only 23, including
the U.S., still maintain full
diplomatic relations with
Johannesburg).
Worldwide criticism, of course,
is directed against the official
policy of apartheid practiced in
South Africa. Whites make up
only 19 percent of the
population, they receive 75
percent of the national income.
On average, Whites earn about
12 times the wages of blacks for
similar jobs, and the gap is
widening. In mining, for example,
the wage differential has risen
from 11.7 in 1911 to 17.0 in
1961 to 20.1 in 1969. Real
earnings for blacks have not risen
since 1911; in fact, they fell
throughout the economy as a
whole nearly 30 percent from
1950 to the present.
Bare Subsistance Level
Eighty percent of South
Africa's blacks live below the
official "Poverty Datum Line"
which measures the bare
subsistance level possible for the
average black family.
Despite UN sanctions, the
United States refuses to break its
ties with the South African
regime. Besides granting full
diplomatic recognition, the
United States supports the regime
with aid to the South African
military, shipping vitally needed
spare parts and supplying "civilian
type" planes to its air force.
Pentagon spokesmen have

specifically reserved the right to
ship other arms to South Africa
"in an effort to protect world
peace and security." The U.S.also
supports the South African
government economically by
granting it special trade
preferences for its sugar exports,
which we deny to Cuba.
Why does the Nixon
Administration insist on keeping
friendly ties with South Africa?
The answer lies in the nature of
America's economic relationship
with that country. Thanks to a
healthy investment climate
provided especially for foreign
firms and cheap and docile labor
force, over 300 multinational
corporations based in the United
States have set up operations in
South Africa.
Billions Invested
These include such giants
(politically as well as
economically) as Chase Manhattan
Bank, Chrysler, Citicorp, Ford,
GM, IBM, ITT, Standard Oil of
California, and EXXON, along
with many others from the
Fortune 500. These companies
have invested more than a billion
dollars in the South African status
quo. Since they earn an average
18.6 percent on their capital
(compared to an average 11
percent elsewhere), American
businessmen value their
investments there.
The U.S. is also interested in
maintaining a stable, pro-Western
government in South Africa to
take advantage of that country's
vast mineral wealth. South Africa
supplies the world (or rather,
those countries that trade with it)
with vast quantities of chromium,
diamonds, gold, platinum,
uranium, and other strategic

minerals vital to the US economy.
Strategic Location
At least as important to the U.S.
is South Africa's strategic
position. The Johannesburg
government is spending $45
million to expand its already
formidable harbor at Simonstown
at the tip of the Cap of Good
Hope for use by its Navy. As
Armed Forces Journal has pointed
out, South Africa "occupies a
strategic location astride
approaches to the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans with one of the
best equipped naval bases in the
Souther Hemisphere."
The magazine, which describes
its 30,000 subscribers as "mostly
high level professionals in the
military, the DoD, in Congress,
and in the defense industries,"
openly argues for "firm, open ties
with the 'gatekeeper' to the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans." One
reason that the U.S. military is so
anxious to retain control of these
sea lanes is that they carry over
half a million tons of petroleum
to the West each day, largely from
Iran. As a point of access into the
Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf,
the Cape of Good Hope is a key
location.
The Nixon Administration, it
was revealed only a month ago, is
now significantly expanding its
military ties with South Africa by
coordinating with the Vorster
government the operation of a
$21 million "communications
complex" sunk into the lower
slopes of a mountain near Cape
Town, designed to provide the U.S.
with secret intelligence on world
shipping in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Possible Concrete Evidence
"If true," writes Tom
Engelhardt for Pacific News
Service, "it would be the first
hard evidence of increased
military ties between the US and
South Africa's tough white
supremacist government — and a
potential diplomatic bombshell in
much of the world."
Sophisticated electronics
equipment within the
communications center already
keeps track of ship movements for
thousands of miles around, and,
according to Armed Forces
Journal, "can flash these ship
plottings to war rooms in the U.S
andU.K.in seconds."
The United States already
relies on South African tracking
stations to monitor its space
launches (including spy satellites).
South African mercenaries have
rescued U.S.backed forces in tight
situations in the Congo (1964)
and are now shoring up Portugal's
crumbling hold on her African
colonies — a move supported by
this Administration. The report of
secret military ties between the
United States and South Africa in
the new Cape Town
communications complex should
come as no surprise, but it does
represent a new level in the
escalating friendship between the
Nixon Administration and its
allies in Johannesburg.
