An Aggressive Israel
Editor:
Despite the headlines we see in
the mass media about detente and
"an era of peace," the world
situation is actually gravely
unstable at the present time. This
has been the view of the Chinese
as expressed by Chou en Lai. The
"sudden" renewal of war in the
Mideast underlines the truth of
the Chinese assertion.
That Russia and the U.S. act as
if they can negotiate peace for
Israel and the Arab countries is
not surprising. But it is also
impossible. Actually, Mr.
Kissinger is trying to 'fool the
Russians in this new "peace"
effort. The U.S. plan appears:
maximum support for the
continuing Israeli attacks inside
Syria and Egypt, while minimizing
the chances of a confrontation
between the U.S. and Russia.
Returning siezed lands is
hardly the policy of an aggressive
Israel. From early 1948 even
before world Zionism declared
Israel independent, she violated
the land and lives of the
Palestinian Arab majority. In less

than a year most Palestinians had
been driven from their land and
homes; thousands were murdered.
The U.N. General Assembly
has condemned Israel 6 times for
aggression against Arab lands, but
Israeli territory continues to grow.
Israel has used napalm to bomb
hospitals, schools and civilian
populations just as the U.S. did in
Vietnam. Within Israel even dark
skinned Jews are badly treated
while Palestinian Arabs who have
lived on this land for at least 13
centuries continuously, have no
political rights and have lost the
property they owned.
The cause of the dispossessed
Palestinian people was once the
only source of Arab hostility in
the Mideast. But with the seizure
of large areas of Egypt, Syria and
Jordan in 1967, Israel served
notice that her "manifest destiny"
had not yet been reached.
Zionism's aggressive intent was
first declared 75 years ago by
Theodore Herzl who said "We will
demand the land we need: the
more immigrants the more land."
In the 40s the great Jewish
scientist Albert Einstein opposed
Zionism and the formation of

Israel. He asked, "What about the
Arabs if Palestine were given to
the Jews?" Chaim Weizman
replied, "What Arabs?" (more
than 2/3 the population). "They
are hardly of any consequence."
The U.S. total support of Israel
is based on the interests of U.S.
corporations in regaining a hold
there. A State Dept. official was
quoted in June 1967 in U.S. News
and World Report: "Israel has
probably done more for the U.S.
in the Middle East in relation to
money and effort invested than
any of our so-called allies and
friends elsewhere ... In the Far
East we can get almost no one to
help us in Vietnam. Here the
Israelis .. . have served our
interest as well as theirs."
As a Jew myself, I ask all
sincere and decent Americans,
including Jews, to oppose this
government's support of an
aggressive Israel.

Explanation Of The Posters
Editor:
My colleagues and I feel we
owe you an explanation, as to

why some have postered your
campus. At first we postered in an
attempt to communicate our
message. We found that our
message was disapproved of by a
select few. This select few decided
to deny us our first amendment
rights, by ripping down our
posters. It was at this time that we
realized that if we stopped
postering we would have been
intimidated into silence. It had
now become a free speech issue,
which resulted in the extensive
use of posters on campus.
After speaking to students, we
found that our posters were
creating an ecological problem on
campus. We believe in responsible
communications, where the
message is not contradicted by the
medium. The message of Jews for
Jesus is such that it can stand in
the areana of Stanford without
having to resort to means that
undermine it. We pledge to be
more responsive to the whole
Stanford community in our
postering, but we will not make
Stanford University the
battleground of paper, only ideas.

Explanation Of The Posters
Editor:
My colleagues and I feel we
owe you an explanation, as to

why some have postered your
campus. At first we postered in an
attempt to communicate our
message. We found that our
message was disapproved of by a
select few. This select few decided
to deny us our first amendment
rights, by ripping down our
posters. It was at this time that we
realized that if we stopped
postering we would have been
intimidated into silence. It had
now become a free speech issue,
which resulted in the extensive
use of posters on campus.
After speaking to students, we
found that our posters were
creating an ecological problem on
campus. We believe in responsible
communications, where the
message is not contradicted by the
medium. The message of Jews for
Jesus is such that it can stand in
the areana of Stanford without
having to resort to means that
undermine it. We pledge to be
more responsive to the whole
Stanford community in our
postering, but we will not make
Stanford University the
battleground of paper, only ideas.

Editor:
Despite the headlines we see in
the mass media about detente and
"an era of peace," the world
situation is actually gravely
unstable at the present time. This
has been the view of the Chinese
as expressed by Chou en Lai. The
"sudden" renewal of war in the
Mideast underlines the truth of
the Chinese assertion.
That Russia and the U.S. act as
if they can negotiate peace for
Israel and the Arab countries is
not surprising. But it is also
impossible. Actually, Mr.
Kissinger is trying to 'fool the
Russians in this new "peace"
effort. The U.S. plan appears:
maximum support for the
continuing Israeli attacks inside
Syria and Egypt, while minimizing
the chances of a confrontation
between the U.S. and Russia.
Returning siezed lands is
hardly the policy of an aggressive
Israel. From early 1948 even
before world Zionism declared
Israel independent, she violated
the land and lives of the
Palestinian Arab majority. In less

than a year most Palestinians had
been driven from their land and
homes; thousands were murdered.
The U.N. General Assembly
has condemned Israel 6 times for
aggression against Arab lands, but
Israeli territory continues to grow.
Israel has used napalm to bomb
hospitals, schools and civilian
populations just as the U.S. did in
Vietnam. Within Israel even dark
skinned Jews are badly treated
while Palestinian Arabs who have
lived on this land for at least 13
centuries continuously, have no
political rights and have lost the
property they owned.
The cause of the dispossessed
Palestinian people was once the
only source of Arab hostility in
the Mideast. But with the seizure
of large areas of Egypt, Syria and
Jordan in 1967, Israel served
notice that her "manifest destiny"
had not yet been reached.
Zionism's aggressive intent was
first declared 75 years ago by
Theodore Herzl who said "We will
demand the land we need: the
more immigrants the more land."
In the 40s the great Jewish
