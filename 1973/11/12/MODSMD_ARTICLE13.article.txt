# No Income But 'Looking Fit'
## Agnew Out Of Work 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In the month since he
quit as vice president, Spiro T. Agnew has been
sifting the relics of his mutilated political career and
preparing to meet an uncertain future. A basic
question is how he will make a living.
Last Saturday, it was exactly one month since
Agnew resigned and pleaded no contest to a charge
of evading $13,551 in 1967 federal income tax. He
was fined $10,000 and sentenced to three years
probation.
Agnew has no job, no known income. He is
threatened with losing his right to practice law and
faces possible Internal Revenue Service suits for
thousands of dollars in back taxes.
Associates who were asked how Agnew would
make a living said they did not know.
Yet they say he shows no sign of depression.
Looking Fit
"He had his whole staff out to his house last
Saturday night for a buffet dinner and he was just
amazing," one friend said. "He looked fit. He was
calm and strong as ever. Judy, Mrs. Agnew, looked
terrific, if anything, better than I've seen her. You
couldn't call it a wake at all. It was a very pleasant
time of renewing old acquaintances."
Several less-pleasant prospects confront Agnew,
however.
— In Maryland, the Baltimore County Bar
Association is investigating the possibility of
bringing disciplinary action against Agnew based on
his conviction on a federal felony charge. If any
such action is recommended and approved by the
courts, Agnew could be disbarred.
More Prosecutions?
— Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Anne
Arundel County prosecutors may launch
investigations to decide if Agnew should be
prosecuted on the local level for alleged crimes
committed while he was chief executive of
Baltimore County and later as Maryland governor.
— Agnew faces mounting bills in the wake of his
legal troubles. A defense fund set up under Chicago
insurance magnate Clement Stone is not expected to
raise enough money to pay Agnew's current legal
costs and if further action is brought against him,
those costs will continue to mount.
— The Internal Revenue Service is believed to be
auditing Agnew's back tax returns with an eye to
collecting what could amount to tens of thousands

of dollars in back taxes.
Payoffs
A 40-page exposition of evidence against Agnew
released by the Justice Department at Agnew's
court appearance alleged that between 1966 and
1972 Agnew received payments of $50,000 from
contractor Allen I. Green, $37,500 from contractor
Lester Matz, $1,250 from contractor Jerome Wolff
and half of what was described only as a substantial
sum from seven other contractors and one bank.
Meanwhile, Agnew was working at winding up
the affairs of his vice presidency. The White House
provided for him a renovated townhouse with
offices normally reserved for former Presidents. The
house is across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
House and is maintained by the General Services
Administration.
"The White House controls who uses that house,
but we maintain it," a GSA spokesman said. "I
doubt that Mr. Agnew is paying rent. I don't think
it would be fair to charge him. He's closing out a
federal office and it's a legitimate use for that
building. Of course, he doesn't have the right to use
it for any personal business."
Agnew Personnel
Most of Agnew's former staff is being placed in
other jobs by the White House personnel office, but
Agnew has kept several of them, at government
expense, to help him wind up his official affairs.
After Agnew's resignation, the Senate approved
for him a 30-day franking — or free mailing —
privilege and he continues to have Secret Service
protection.
Agnew's treatment since his resignation was
criticized Thursday by Rep. John E. Moss, D-Calif.,
who has asked the General Accounting Office for an
investigation.
Moss said in a letter to the GAO that he
understood Agnew also was getting government
limousines and drivers and the use of military
aircraft.
There is a law providing transition expenses for
former Presidents and vice presidents at the time of
an administration changeover.
Moss asked for an opinion on whether this
applied in Agnew's case, saying the expenses for the
various services Agnew was getting "could actually
offset or even make good whatever fines he has thus
far had assessed upon him by the courts."
