# Psychologists See Strains After War
## Israelis Emerge A Troubled People' 
### 
TEL AVIV (AP) — Israel has
emerged from the latest Mideast
war a nation of tense, troubled
and uncertain people capable of
"very irrational reactions" in the
future unless permanent peace
comes soon, say top
psychologists.
The war dispelled the
comforting view held by many
Israelis, these psychologists say, of
"seeing themselves as supermen
and the other side as permmently
inferior and destroyed theii iu '&»
of security."
Since the war began Oct. 6 the
number of depressed Israeli
civilians seeking treatment at the
country's 20 community mental
health centers has increased by 10
percent, said Dr. Ludwig Tramer,
Israel's mental health director, in
an interview.
He refused to disclose any
other statistics but said: "There is

very great tension among people
in the country. Unless it is
reduced by a desirable
development, our centers will
continue to be very heavily
overloaded in the future."
Dr. Hans Kreitler, who
founded the psychology
department at Tel Aviv
University, said in a separate
interview: "It's a war with a bad
taste — so bad a taste that even
when there is good news, the
people are not very happy."
In 1967, when Israeli forces
conquered Jerusalem, the Golan
Heights and Sinai, there was a
feeling that "the motherland had
been redeemed," he said. "In fact,
there was very little loft to
conquer in the sense
conquering the fatherland, so
war, which was forced on us, had
no meaning, no aim.
"We could only crush the

armies of our enemies because we
can't conquer their countries and
we couldn't be enthusiastic about
such an aim," Kreitler said. "We
fought for our existence. We
didn't even fight for peace.
Therefore, all our reactions were
rather sobering."
Achi Yotan, a counseling
psychologist in the Department of
Social Welfare, said the war

brought home something that
Israelis have always known but
chosen to ignore in the past — the
fact that they live in a small
country surrounded by enemies.
"People thought we were so
strong, so brave that nothing
could toucn us," he said. "Many
people would smile when they'd
say Israel was a small nation
surrounded by enemies. Now they
all talk about danger coming to be
a reality in the last few weeks."
A public opinion survey
conducted by the Israel Institute
for Applied Social Research and
by Hebrew University's
Communications Institute found
80 percent of the public
supporting the government
throughout the war.
But there was a slight shift in
the degree of satisfaction with
fewer people saying it was doing a
very good job.

health centers has increased by 10
percent, said Dr. Ludwig Tramer,
Israel's mental health director, in
an interview.
He refused to disclose any
other statistics but said: "There is

very great tension among people
in the country. Unless it is
reduced by a desirable
development, our centers will
continue to be very heavily
overloaded in the future."
Dr. Hans Kreitler, who
founded the psychology
department at Tel Aviv
University, said in a separate
interview: "It's a war with a bad
taste — so bad a taste that even
when there is good news, the
people are not very happy."
In 1967, when Israeli forces
conquered Jerusalem, the Golan
Heights and Sinai, there was a
feeling that "the motherland had
been redeemed," he said. "In fact,
there was very little loft to
conquer in the sense
conquering the fatherland, so
war, which was forced on us, had
no meaning, no aim.
"We could only crush the

armies of our enemies because we
can't conquer their countries and
we couldn't be enthusiastic about
such an aim," Kreitler said. "We
fought for our existence. We
didn't even fight for peace.
Therefore, all our reactions were
rather sobering."
Achi Yotan, a counseling
psychologist in the Department of
Social Welfare, said the war

brought home something that
Israelis have always known but
chosen to ignore in the past — the
fact that they live in a small
country surrounded by enemies.
"People thought we were so
strong, so brave that nothing
could toucn us," he said. "Many
people would smile when they'd
say Israel was a small nation
surrounded by enemies. Now they
all talk about danger coming to be
a reality in the last few weeks."
A public opinion survey
conducted by the Israel Institute
for Applied Social Research and
by Hebrew University's
Communications Institute found
80 percent of the public
supporting the government
throughout the war.
But there was a slight shift in
the degree of satisfaction with
fewer people saying it was doing a
very good job.

TEL AVIV (AP) — Israel has
emerged from the latest Mideast
war a nation of tense, troubled
and uncertain people capable of
"very irrational reactions" in the
future unless permanent peace
comes soon, say top
psychologists.
The war dispelled the
comforting view held by many
Israelis, these psychologists say, of
"seeing themselves as supermen
and the other side as permmently
inferior and destroyed theii iu '&»
of security."
Since the war began Oct. 6 the
number of depressed Israeli
civilians seeking treatment at the
country's 20 community mental
health centers has increased by 10
percent, said Dr. Ludwig Tramer,
