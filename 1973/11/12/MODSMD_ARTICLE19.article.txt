# Last-Second Field Goal Ends Cardinal Odyssey
## Limahelu's Boot Causes Coliseum Uproar, Leaves Stanford Fans In Stunned Silence 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
LOS ANGELES — Just when 8000
transplanted Northern Californians were on
the verge of euphoria Saturday, along came a
wispy Indonesian placejcicker to jolt
Stanford's rooters back to the reality of the
Pacific Eight Conference.
Chris Limahelu, a 5-5 senior who formerly
weighed 130 pounds "but lost at least 10
pounds today," kicked a 34-yard field goal
with just three seconds remaining to lift USC
past Stanford, 27-26, before 63,806
thoroughly entertained fans at the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
The finish, which upstaged a brilliant
59-minute, 57-second effort by the Cardinals,
was strangely reminiscent of the 1969 meeting
between the two teams. In that game, USC's
Ron Ayala booted a last second field goal of
the identical length to give the Trojans a
26-24 victory.
And so it goes for Stanford and USC,
whose rivalry has produced some of the most
thrilling games in Pac-8 history. And this one,
which featured a 59-yard Rod Garcia field
goal, some pinpoint Mike Boryla passes, some
typically explosive antics by Anthony Davis
and Lynn Swann and a finish that had most of
the crowdclinging precariously to the edge of
their seats, may have been the most
emotion-draining Card-Trojan battle of all.
Most of those emotions were drained, of
course, during the final 3:10, when Stanford's
nine-point lead and flickering Rose Bowl
hopes vanished into the Los Angeles smog.
Garcia Sets Record
The Cards seemed comfortably out in front
at the 3:10 mark, when Garcia booted his
fourth field goal of the day, a 25-yard shot
that raised his career total to 39, two more
than the previous NCAA record held by
Wyoming's Bob Jacobs. At that point the
Cards led 26-17 and the victory seemed
relatively secure.
On the ensuing kickoff, however, Ted
Roberson cleanly fielded a ground ball and
advanced it to the USC 46 yard line, from
where Trojan quarterback Pat Haden dropped
back to pass on the first play. Haden lofted a
high spiral downfield toward Lynn Swann,

who didn't have a chance to catch the
overthrown toss. But Swann and Stanford
defensive back Jim Kaffen collided and a
highly questionable pass interference call gave
the Trojans the ball on Stanford's 12 yard line
— a 42-yard gain.
"I was just looking for the ball and he ran
into me," a distraught Kaffen said afterward.
Three plays later Haden rolled to his right
and darted into the end zone from 10 yards
out, concluding a four-play drive that covered
54 yards.
Stanford managed one first down on its
next possession and things were still looking
good for the Cards when Dave Ottmar
dropped back in punt formation with 43
seconds remaining. And when a host of
Cardinal defenders swarmed over Swann at
the USC 30, things looked even better.
'Tough To Tackle'
Only 33 seconds remained, but Haden
coolly marched his team downfield. First, he
threw a 24-yard pass to tight end Jim
Obradovich. Then came a four-yard toss to
Davis, who dragged two Cardinals out of
bounds on the Stanford 46. ("Their backs are
tough," Stanford coach Jack Christiansen was
to say later. "Tough to tackle and tough to
keep in bounds.")
Now only 15 seconds remained, and Haden
again looked for Obradovich. The big tight
end snared the ball for a 25-yard gain and
dashed out of bounds at the 17.
There were seven seconds left, plenty of
time for the diminutive Limahelu to kick his
field goal — plenty of time for the previously
stunned USC crowd to erupt into a tumultous
ovation while Stanford's faithful stared
blankly across the playing field.
What had happened in those 3:10 was
simple. USC mounted two drives, one
covering 54 yards, the other 70. It all took
only nine plays, and there wasn't even an
onside kick in between. (USC coach John
McKay said he didn't gamble on an onside
kick because of Garcia's incredible range.
"Any time they make two first downs he's in
range," McKay said, "and he may miss against
other people, but he never misses against us.")
"Our whole team was cool during that

drive," McKay said. "It was almost identical
to the 1969 game."
Of course the Trojans almost didn't have a
chance to mount their comeback. USC
stumbled, fumbled, threw interceptions and
committed infractions during the game's first
57 minutes, much to the chagrin of McKay.
But Stanford didn't feel at all guilty about
taking advantage of the Trojan errors. Kaffen
intercepted two passes. Randy Poltl recovered
two fumbles and Pat Donovan and Terry Pape
each fell on loose balls.
And when penalties weren't moving the
ball toward the Trojan goal line (USC was
penalized 100 yards), Boryla's passes and
some gutty running by Scott Laidlaw kept the
Cards on the offensive.
It was all so satisfying and so rewarding
that even the painful ending couldn't keep
Christiansen from expressing some genuine
pride in his team's performance. "That," he
said, breaking the deathly locker room silence,
"was one hell of a ball game."
* * *
Cardinal Notes: McKay said after the game
that he harbored "no special animosity"
toward Stanford, despite his infamous
remarks following last year's game at Stanford
Stadium. "Stanford is a very good football
team," McKay said, "and they're very good
sports."
The fact was lost in the confusion of the
game, but Boryla's 187-yard passing
performance vaulted him into second place on
the Stanford career passing list. Boryla now
has 3833 yards.
Forrie Martin led the Card defensive
statistics with 15 tackles, seven of which were
unassisted. Other defensive standouts were
Gordie Riegel, named defensive player of the
game for his eight tackles (twice he nailed
Davis for losses), Roger Stillwell (nine tackes)
and James Ferguson (eight).
Flanker Reggie Ishman had his finest day
of the season, catching four passes for 69
yards, including a 36-yard reception. Dave
Ottmar punted eight times for a 46.6 yard
average.

with just three seconds remaining to lift USC

Now only 15 seconds remained, and Haden
again looked for Obradovich. The big tight
end snared the ball for a 25-yard gain and
dashed out of bounds at the 17.
There were seven seconds left, plenty of
time for the diminutive Limahelu to kick his
field goal — plenty of time for the previously
stunned USC crowd to erupt into a tumultous
ovation while Stanford's faithful stared
blankly across the playing field.
What had happened in those 3:10 was
simple. USC mounted two drives, one
covering 54 yards, the other 70. It all took
only nine plays, and there wasn't even an
onside kick in between. (USC coach John
McKay said he didn't gamble on an onside
kick because of Garcia's incredible range.
"Any time they make two first downs he's in
range," McKay said, "and he may miss against
other people, but he never misses against us.")
"Our whole team was cool during that

drive," McKay said. "It was almost identical
to the 1969 game."
Of course the Trojans almost didn't have a
chance to mount their comeback. USC
stumbled, fumbled, threw interceptions and
committed infractions during the game's first
57 minutes, much to the chagrin of McKay.
But Stanford didn't feel at all guilty about
taking advantage of the Trojan errors. Kaffen
intercepted two passes. Randy Poltl recovered
two fumbles and Pat Donovan and Terry Pape
each fell on loose balls.
And when penalties weren't moving the
ball toward the Trojan goal line (USC was
penalized 100 yards), Boryla's passes and
some gutty running by Scott Laidlaw kept the
Cards on the offensive.
It was all so satisfying and so rewarding
that even the painful ending couldn't keep
Christiansen from expressing some genuine
pride in his team's performance. "That," he
said, breaking the deathly locker room silence,
"was one hell of a ball game."
* * *
Cardinal Notes: McKay said after the game
that he harbored "no special animosity"
toward Stanford, despite his infamous
remarks following last year's game at Stanford
Stadium. "Stanford is a very good football
team," McKay said, "and they're very good
sports."
The fact was lost in the confusion of the
game, but Boryla's 187-yard passing
performance vaulted him into second place on
the Stanford career passing list. Boryla now
has 3833 yards.
Forrie Martin led the Card defensive
statistics with 15 tackles, seven of which were
unassisted. Other defensive standouts were
Gordie Riegel, named defensive player of the
game for his eight tackles (twice he nailed
Davis for losses), Roger Stillwell (nine tackes)
and James Ferguson (eight).
Flanker Reggie Ishman had his finest day
of the season, catching four passes for 69
yards, including a 36-yard reception. Dave
Ottmar punted eight times for a 46.6 yard
average.

STANFORD'S HEARTBREAK — There were only three seconds showing on the Los Angeles Coliseum
clock when Chris Limahelu kicked this 34-yard field goal. The kick gave USC a 27-26 victory after
Stanford had led for almost the entire game.
LOS ANGELES — Just when 8000
transplanted Northern Californians were on
the verge of euphoria Saturday, along came a
wispy Indonesian placejcicker to jolt
Stanford's rooters back to the reality of the
Pacific Eight Conference.
Chris Limahelu, a 5-5 senior who formerly
weighed 130 pounds "but lost at least 10
pounds today," kicked a 34-yard field goal
with just three seconds remaining to lift USC
past Stanford, 27-26, before 63,806
thoroughly entertained fans at the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
The finish, which upstaged a brilliant
59-minute, 57-second effort by the Cardinals,
was strangely reminiscent of the 1969 meeting
between the two teams. In that game, USC's
Ron Ayala booted a last second field goal of
the identical length to give the Trojans a
26-24 victory.
And so it goes for Stanford and USC,
whose rivalry has produced some of the most
thrilling games in Pac-8 history. And this one,
which featured a 59-yard Rod Garcia field
goal, some pinpoint Mike Boryla passes, some
typically explosive antics by Anthony Davis
and Lynn Swann and a finish that had most of
the crowdclinging precariously to the edge of
their seats, may have been the most
emotion-draining Card-Trojan battle of all.
Most of those emotions were drained, of
course, during the final 3:10, when Stanford's
nine-point lead and flickering Rose Bowl
hopes vanished into the Los Angeles smog.
Garcia Sets Record
The Cards seemed comfortably out in front
at the 3:10 mark, when Garcia booted his
fourth field goal of the day, a 25-yard shot
that raised his career total to 39, two more
than the previous NCAA record held by
Wyoming's Bob Jacobs. At that point the
Cards led 26-17 and the victory seemed
relatively secure.
On the ensuing kickoff, however, Ted
Roberson cleanly fielded a ground ball and
advanced it to the USC 46 yard line, from
where Trojan quarterback Pat Haden dropped
back to pass on the first play. Haden lofted a
high spiral downfield toward Lynn Swann,

who didn't have a chance to catch the
overthrown toss. But Swann and Stanford
defensive back Jim Kaffen collided and a
highly questionable pass interference call gave
the Trojans the ball on Stanford's 12 yard line
— a 42-yard gain.
"I was just looking for the ball and he ran
into me," a distraught Kaffen said afterward.
Three plays later Haden rolled to his right
and darted into the end zone from 10 yards
out, concluding a four-play drive that covered
54 yards.
Stanford managed one first down on its
next possession and things were still looking
good for the Cards when Dave Ottmar
dropped back in punt formation with 43
seconds remaining. And when a host of
Cardinal defenders swarmed over Swann at
the USC 30, things looked even better.
'Tough To Tackle'
Only 33 seconds remained, but Haden
coolly marched his team downfield. First, he
threw a 24-yard pass to tight end Jim
Obradovich. Then came a four-yard toss to
Davis, who dragged two Cardinals out of
bounds on the Stanford 46. ("Their backs are
tough," Stanford coach Jack Christiansen was
to say later. "Tough to tackle and tough to
keep in bounds.")
Now only 15 seconds remained, and Haden
again looked for Obradovich. The big tight
end snared the ball for a 25-yard gain and

clock when Chris Limahelu kicked this 34-yard field goal. The kick gave USC a 27-26 victory after
Stanford had led for almost the entire game.
LOS ANGELES — Just when 8000
transplanted Northern Californians were on
the verge of euphoria Saturday, along came a
wispy Indonesian placejcicker to jolt
Stanford's rooters back to the reality of the
Pacific Eight Conference.
Chris Limahelu, a 5-5 senior who formerly
weighed 130 pounds "but lost at least 10
pounds today," kicked a 34-yard field goal
with just three seconds remaining to lift USC
past Stanford, 27-26, before 63,806
thoroughly entertained fans at the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
The finish, which upstaged a brilliant
59-minute, 57-second effort by the Cardinals,
was strangely reminiscent of the 1969 meeting
between the two teams. In that game, USC's
Ron Ayala booted a last second field goal of
the identical length to give the Trojans a
26-24 victory.
And so it goes for Stanford and USC,
whose rivalry has produced some of the most
thrilling games in Pac-8 history. And this one,
which featured a 59-yard Rod Garcia field
goal, some pinpoint Mike Boryla passes, some
typically explosive antics by Anthony Davis
and Lynn Swann and a finish that had most of
the crowdclinging precariously to the edge of
their seats, may have been the most
emotion-draining Card-Trojan battle of all.
Most of those emotions were drained, of
course, during the final 3:10, when Stanford's
nine-point lead and flickering Rose Bowl
hopes vanished into the Los Angeles smog.
Garcia Sets Record
The Cards seemed comfortably out in front
at the 3:10 mark, when Garcia booted his
fourth field goal of the day, a 25-yard shot
that raised his career total to 39, two more
than the previous NCAA record held by
Wyoming's Bob Jacobs. At that point the
Cards led 26-17 and the victory seemed
relatively secure.
On the ensuing kickoff, however, Ted
Roberson cleanly fielded a ground ball and
advanced it to the USC 46 yard line, from
where Trojan quarterback Pat Haden dropped
back to pass on the first play. Haden lofted a
high spiral downfield toward Lynn Swann,

who didn't have a chance to catch the
overthrown toss. But Swann and Stanford
defensive back Jim Kaffen collided and a
highly questionable pass interference call gave
the Trojans the ball on Stanford's 12 yard line
— a 42-yard gain.
"I was just looking for the ball and he ran
into me," a distraught Kaffen said afterward.
Three plays later Haden rolled to his right
and darted into the end zone from 10 yards
out, concluding a four-play drive that covered
54 yards.
Stanford managed one first down on its
next possession and things were still looking
good for the Cards when Dave Ottmar
dropped back in punt formation with 43
seconds remaining. And when a host of
Cardinal defenders swarmed over Swann at
the USC 30, things looked even better.
'Tough To Tackle'
Only 33 seconds remained, but Haden
coolly marched his team downfield. First, he
threw a 24-yard pass to tight end Jim
Obradovich. Then came a four-yard toss to
Davis, who dragged two Cardinals out of
bounds on the Stanford 46. ("Their backs are
tough," Stanford coach Jack Christiansen was
to say later. "Tough to tackle and tough to
keep in bounds.")
Now only 15 seconds remained, and Haden
again looked for Obradovich. The big tight
end snared the ball for a 25-yard gain and
dashed out of bounds at the 17.
There were seven seconds left, plenty of
time for the diminutive Limahelu to kick his
field goal — plenty of time for the previously
stunned USC crowd to erupt into a tumultous
ovation while Stanford's faithful stared
blankly across the playing field.
What had happened in those 3:10 was
simple. USC mounted two drives, one
covering 54 yards, the other 70. It all took
only nine plays, and there wasn't even an
onside kick in between. (USC coach John
McKay said he didn't gamble on an onside
kick because of Garcia's incredible range.
"Any time they make two first downs he's in
range," McKay said, "and he may miss against
other people, but he never misses against us.")
"Our whole team was cool during that

drive," McKay said. "It was almost identical
to the 1969 game."
Of course the Trojans almost didn't have a
chance to mount their comeback. USC
stumbled, fumbled, threw interceptions and
committed infractions during the game's first
57 minutes, much to the chagrin of McKay.
But Stanford didn't feel at all guilty about
taking advantage of the Trojan errors. Kaffen
intercepted two passes. Randy Poltl recovered
two fumbles and Pat Donovan and Terry Pape
each fell on loose balls.
And when penalties weren't moving the
ball toward the Trojan goal line (USC was
penalized 100 yards), Boryla's passes and
some gutty running by Scott Laidlaw kept the
Cards on the offensive.
It was all so satisfying and so rewarding
that even the painful ending couldn't keep
Christiansen from expressing some genuine
pride in his team's performance. "That," he
said, breaking the deathly locker room silence,
"was one hell of a ball game."
* * *
Cardinal Notes: McKay said after the game
that he harbored "no special animosity"
toward Stanford, despite his infamous
remarks following last year's game at Stanford
Stadium. "Stanford is a very good football
team," McKay said, "and they're very good
sports."
The fact was lost in the confusion of the
game, but Boryla's 187-yard passing
performance vaulted him into second place on
the Stanford career passing list. Boryla now
has 3833 yards.
Forrie Martin led the Card defensive
statistics with 15 tackles, seven of which were
unassisted. Other defensive standouts were
Gordie Riegel, named defensive player of the
game for his eight tackles (twice he nailed
Davis for losses), Roger Stillwell (nine tackes)
and James Ferguson (eight).
Flanker Reggie Ishman had his finest day
of the season, catching four passes for 69
yards, including a 36-yard reception. Dave
Ottmar punted eight times for a 46.6 yard
average.

with just three seconds remaining to lift USC

tough," Stanford coach Jack Christiansen was
to say later. "Tough to tackle and tough to
keep in bounds.")
Now only 15 seconds remained, and Haden
again looked for Obradovich. The big tight
end snared the ball for a 25-yard gain and
dashed out of bounds at the 17.
There were seven seconds left, plenty of
time for the diminutive Limahelu to kick his
field goal — plenty of time for the previously
stunned USC crowd to erupt into a tumultous
ovation while Stanford's faithful stared
blankly across the playing field.
What had happened in those 3:10 was
simple. USC mounted two drives, one
covering 54 yards, the other 70. It all took
only nine plays, and there wasn't even an
onside kick in between. (USC coach John
McKay said he didn't gamble on an onside
kick because of Garcia's incredible range.
"Any time they make two first downs he's in
range," McKay said, "and he may miss against
other people, but he never misses against us.")
"Our whole team was cool during that

drive," McKay said. "It was almost identical
to the 1969 game."
Of course the Trojans almost didn't have a
chance to mount their comeback. USC
stumbled, fumbled, threw interceptions and
committed infractions during the game's first
57 minutes, much to the chagrin of McKay.
But Stanford didn't feel at all guilty about
taking advantage of the Trojan errors. Kaffen
intercepted two passes. Randy Poltl recovered
two fumbles and Pat Donovan and Terry Pape
each fell on loose balls.
And when penalties weren't moving the
ball toward the Trojan goal line (USC was
penalized 100 yards), Boryla's passes and
some gutty running by Scott Laidlaw kept the
Cards on the offensive.
It was all so satisfying and so rewarding
that even the painful ending couldn't keep
Christiansen from expressing some genuine
pride in his team's performance. "That," he
said, breaking the deathly locker room silence,
"was one hell of a ball game."

Cardinal Notes: McKay said after the game
that he harbored "no special animosity"
toward Stanford, despite his infamous
remarks following last year's game at Stanford
Stadium. "Stanford is a very good football
team," McKay said, "and they're very good
sports."
The fact was lost in the confusion of the
game, but Boryla's 187-yard passing
performance vaulted him into second place on
the Stanford career passing list. Boryla now
has 3833 yards.
Forrie Martin led the Card defensive
statistics with 15 tackles, seven of which were
unassisted. Other defensive standouts were
Gordie Riegel, named defensive player of the
game for his eight tackles (twice he nailed
Davis for losses), Roger Stillwell (nine tackes)
and James Ferguson (eight).
Flanker Reggie Ishman had his finest day
of the season, catching four passes for 69
yards, including a 36-yard reception. Dave
Ottmar punted eight times for a 46.6 yard
average.

STANFORD'S HEARTBREAK — There were only three seconds showing on the Los Angeles Coliseum
clock when Chris Limahelu kicked this 34-yard field goal. The kick gave USC a 27-26 victory after
Stanford had led for almost the entire game.
