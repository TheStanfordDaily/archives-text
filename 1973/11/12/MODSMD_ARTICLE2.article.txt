# Professors Disagree On Energy Controls

### BILL ROSS 
A negotiated agreement between
environmentalists and industrialists is
necessary if the energy crisis is to be
resolved, according to William K.
Linvill, chairman of the
Engineering-Economic Systems
Department.
"We need a Kissinger, not a czar,"
Linvill said, referring to John A. Love,
national energy policy director. 'The
trouble with having a czar is that it is a
simple-minded solution to a
complicated problem."
President Nixon's energy address
last week proposed some good short
term solutions, but it failed to grapple
with basic problems, Linvill stated.
"He recognized the crisis — we do
have a crisis — but his talk neglected to
propose a needed compromise
between industry and
environmentalists," Linvill
commented. "I think the attempts of
certain groups to protect the
environment are absolutely right, but
no one has suggested a way for society
to pay the cost.
"Petroleum, coal and uranium
producers will respect environmental
concerns if they don't have to pay for
them entirely themselves," Linvill said.

But he stated, for six years there
has been a stalemate between
environmentalists and industry. For
example, no nuclear power plants are
being built because environmentalists
have predicated their appeals to the
public on distorted data, he
contended.
"Nuclear power plants are just not
as hazardous as has been claimed,"
Linvill declared. "The risk of
explosion is minimal."
Linvill emphasized that both
factions in the energy controversy
have valid claims. It is extremely
important that an agreement between
them be reached rather than having
the government impose controls, he
said.
Disagree
But David Thompson, professor of
industrial engineering, disagreed about
the need for controls.
"We need strict measures to deal
with the dilemma," he said. "If we
have a fair czar who works within the
law, I see nothing wrong with the
imposition of controls."
For example, a lower maximum
speed limit is an excellent idea,
Thompson remarked. Also, it might be
