# Professors Disagree On Energy Controls
## 
### BILL ROSS 
A negotiated agreement between
environmentalists and industrialists is
necessary if the energy crisis is to be
resolved, according to William K.
Linvill, chairman of the
Engineering-Economic Systems
Department.
"We need a Kissinger, not a czar,"
Linvill said, referring to John A. Love,
national energy policy director. 'The
trouble with having a czar is that it is a
simple-minded solution to a
complicated problem."
President Nixon's energy address
last week proposed some good short
term solutions, but it failed to grapple
with basic problems, Linvill stated.
"He recognized the crisis — we do
have a crisis — but his talk neglected to
propose a needed compromise
between industry and
environmentalists," Linvill
commented. "I think the attempts of
certain groups to protect the
environment are absolutely right, but
no one has suggested a way for society
to pay the cost.
"Petroleum, coal and uranium
producers will respect environmental
concerns if they don't have to pay for
them entirely themselves," Linvill said.

But he stated, for six years there
has been a stalemate between
environmentalists and industry. For
example, no nuclear power plants are
being built because environmentalists
have predicated their appeals to the
public on distorted data, he
contended.
"Nuclear power plants are just not
as hazardous as has been claimed,"
Linvill declared. "The risk of
explosion is minimal."
Linvill emphasized that both
factions in the energy controversy
have valid claims. It is extremely
important that an agreement between
them be reached rather than having
the government impose controls, he
said.
Disagree
But David Thompson, professor of
industrial engineering, disagreed about
the need for controls.
"We need strict measures to deal
with the dilemma," he said. "If we
have a fair czar who works within the
law, I see nothing wrong with the
imposition of controls."
For example, a lower maximum
speed limit is an excellent idea,
Thompson remarked. Also, it might be
from Social Security, which he called
the "two biggest single sources" of
student aid.
Family contribution formulas used
by scholarship services "appear to
overestimate the expected
contribution of middle income
families," according to one Stanford
bulletin. Newman says that these
formulas have become liberalized over
the years.
"Curves used for family income
have moved up and up so that more
students can be eligible for
scholarships. We have been moving
steadily toward increasing the
resources. Our role in that is to do the
research and to argue the case,"

Newman explained.
Bacchetti admitted the $160 figure
was usable "only as an average." The
figure varies for each student, as
money provided to the Financial Aids
Office is doled out on an individual
basis.
'Highest Priority'
"Financial aid has always had the
highest priority in the budget,"
Bacchetti elaborated.
He said that the particular problems
of middle-income students are now
being more carefully examined in the
Financial Aids Office.
"A new counselor was added this
year for middle-income students," he
continued.
Tuition for the Medical School is

slated to go up 7.2 percent to $3570,
while Business School tuition will rise
5.26 percent to $3600 if the trustees
approve the administration's
suggestions.
Bacchetti says he doesn't know
what he'll do if the trustees don't raise
tuition as much as the administration
hopes they will.
"I don't know. We've been through
five years of the Budget Adjustment
Program. The guiding criteria has been
finding the budget cut that is least
severe. We would, as carefully as we
could, go through and assess the
various impacts" of possible budget
cuts, Bacchetti said. He added that
"irreversible" budget cuts would be
avoided.

public on distorted data, he
contended.
"Nuclear power plants are just not
as hazardous as has been claimed,"
Linvill declared. "The risk of
explosion is minimal."
Linvill emphasized that both
factions in the energy controversy
have valid claims. It is extremely
important that an agreement between
them be reached rather than having
the government impose controls, he
said.
Disagree
But David Thompson, professor of
industrial engineering, disagreed about
the need for controls.
"We need strict measures to deal
with the dilemma," he said. "If we
have a fair czar who works within the
law, I see nothing wrong with the
imposition of controls."
For example, a lower maximum
speed limit is an excellent idea,
Thompson remarked. Also, it might be
from Social Security, which he called
the "two biggest single sources" of
student aid.
Family contribution formulas used
by scholarship services "appear to
overestimate the expected
contribution of middle income
families," according to one Stanford
bulletin. Newman says that these
formulas have become liberalized over
the years.
"Curves used for family income
have moved up and up so that more
students can be eligible for
scholarships. We have been moving
steadily toward increasing the
resources. Our role in that is to do the
research and to argue the case,"

Newman explained.
Bacchetti admitted the $160 figure
was usable "only as an average." The
figure varies for each student, as
money provided to the Financial Aids
Office is doled out on an individual
basis.
'Highest Priority'
"Financial aid has always had the
highest priority in the budget,"
Bacchetti elaborated.
He said that the particular problems
of middle-income students are now
being more carefully examined in the
Financial Aids Office.
"A new counselor was added this
year for middle-income students," he
continued.
Tuition for the Medical School is

slated to go up 7.2 percent to $3570,
while Business School tuition will rise
5.26 percent to $3600 if the trustees
approve the administration's
suggestions.
Bacchetti says he doesn't know
what he'll do if the trustees don't raise
tuition as much as the administration
hopes they will.
"I don't know. We've been through
five years of the Budget Adjustment
Program. The guiding criteria has been
finding the budget cut that is least
severe. We would, as carefully as we
could, go through and assess the
various impacts" of possible budget
cuts, Bacchetti said. He added that
"irreversible" budget cuts would be
avoided.
A negotiated agreement between
environmentalists and industrialists is
necessary if the energy crisis is to be
resolved, according to William K.
Linvill, chairman of the
Engineering-Economic Systems
Department.
"We need a Kissinger, not a czar,"
Linvill said, referring to John A. Love,
national energy policy director. 'The
trouble with having a czar is that it is a
simple-minded solution to a
complicated problem."
President Nixon's energy address
last week proposed some good short
term solutions, but it failed to grapple
with basic problems, Linvill stated.
"He recognized the crisis — we do
have a crisis — but his talk neglected to
propose a needed compromise
between industry and
environmentalists," Linvill
commented. "I think the attempts of
certain groups to protect the
environment are absolutely right, but
no one has suggested a way for society
to pay the cost.
"Petroleum, coal and uranium
producers will respect environmental
concerns if they don't have to pay for
them entirely themselves," Linvill said.

But he stated, for six years there
has been a stalemate between
environmentalists and industry. For
example, no nuclear power plants are
being built because environmentalists
have predicated their appeals to the
public on distorted data, he
contended.
"Nuclear power plants are just not
as hazardous as has been claimed,"
Linvill declared. "The risk of
explosion is minimal."
