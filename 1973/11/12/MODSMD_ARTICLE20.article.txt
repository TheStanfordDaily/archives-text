# Pac—8 Roundup
## Two Teams Remain In Race For Roses 
### 
Saturday's results confirmed
that the Nov. 24 contest between
USC and UCLA will determine
the Pacific Eight's representative
in Pasadena on New Year's Day.
Both schools extended their
conference winning streaks to five
games.
While the Trojans were edging
Stanford, the Bruin Wishbone
bested a persistent Oregon team,
27-7 in Eugene. UCLA led the
Ducks only 6-0 at halftime, but
capitalized on several rain-induced
fumbles in the second half to pull
away.
The Bruins amassed 353 yards
on the ground, with halfback
Kermit Johnson gaining 152 yards
on 20 carries during the three
quarters he played. Johnson is
now sixth on the all-time Pac-8
career rushing list with 2345
yards. He could move up to third
by the end of the season.
UCLA quarterback Mark
Harmon ran for two touchdowns
and threw only one pass — for an
interception.
The Ducks are battling
California and Washington, all
currently 2-3 in the Pac-8, for a
berth in the upper division of the
conference.
In a game marked by numerous
turnovers and a fake field goal
attempt which netted Oregon
State a first down, the Beavers
lost to Washington State, 13-7.
Joe Denalo's two field goals and
an extra point provided the

winning margin for the Cougars.
On-again, off-again Cal rolled
over San Jose State, 19-9 in
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium,
with • tailback Chuck Muncie
rushing for 80 yards on 19 carries
and scoring two touchdowns.
The Bear defense, led by junior
safety Karl Crumpacker, held
Craig Kimball, the sixth leading
passer in the nation, to 12
completions in 30 attempts for
111 yards. However, Cal
quarterbacks Vince Ferragamo
and Steve Bartkowski fared little
better, completing six of 16
passes for only 54 yards.
In other non-conference
action, Washington overwhelmed
Idaho, 41-14, with Cliff Mcßride
throwing a 43-yard touchdown
pass on his first varsity play and
freshman Gustavo Clark kicking
for 11 points. The Huskies are
now 2-7 overall, but remain
winless in the conference.
