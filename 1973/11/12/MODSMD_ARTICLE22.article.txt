# Daily Waltzes Past Daily Trojan

### 
LOS ANGELES — The Stanford Daily
Thunderturkeys, still flushed from their
previous week's win over the
Administration Lackeys, added an element
of revenge to their 21-6 touch football
triumph over the USC Daily Trojan staff
here Saturday.
The Turkeys were at first somewhat
reluctant to take the field against their
southland foes, some of them remembering
the beating administered by SC ringers in
their last contest two years ago. The
Thunderturkeys' fears were not allayed
when they saw their foes for the first time
Saturday. "Christ, who let them out of
their cages?" asked wide receiver Charlie
Hoffman.
Other Turkeys cast aspersions on the
validity of some SC players' journalistic
credentials. "We ought to demand to see
bylines," one Daily player suggested.
Once the contest started, however, it
was the Daily Trojan squad that fell victim.
The Turkeys struck in the first quarter
with a touchdown pass from quarterback
Stan Wilson to Buz Battle, and took a 6-0
lead into the third quarter.

Wilson iced the game with two
touchdown tosses in the second half, one a
pass to his brother Mark and the other a
slightly underthrown bomb that wide
receiver Glenn Kramon battled an SC
defender for a spectacular reception.
The contest was the most physical one
the Turkeys have encountered this season.
Don "Cheap Shot" Tollefson learned
several times how much better it is to give
than to receive, but avenged himself when,
with the score 13-6 in the third quarter and
the game far from decided, he sacked the
SC quarterback in his own end zone for the
safety that put the game out of reach.
Kramon's spectacular fourth quarter catch
ended the scoring.
Tollefson and Battle shared defensive
honors for the game, while QB Wilson took
the Offensive Nepotism Award for his
choice of targets on two of the
touchdowns — his brother and his
roommate. Other standouts for the Daily
included Rich Cortez and Bruce "Krusher"
Kadden on defense, and Kramon on
offense.
The victory improved the Daily's season
record to 4-0.
