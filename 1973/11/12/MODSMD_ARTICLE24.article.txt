# Garcia Not Awed By Kicking Marks
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
LOS ANGELES - As the
anguish of USC's 27-26 win over
Stanford Saturday fades, it
becomes easier to recall the 59,
42, 52 and 25 yard field goals
with which Rod Garcia kicked
Bob Jacobs out of the NCAA
record books.
With his four-for-four
performance, Garcia upped his
career field goal total to 39,
eclipsing Jacobs' mark of 37 set at
Wyoming 1968-70.
In addition, Garcia's 59-yarder
is the longest field goal ever
kicked in the Pacific Eight
conference as well as the longest
ever booted in the 50-year-old
Coliseum. The first-quarter kick,
which silenced the boisterous USC
partisans and cleared the crossbar
with five yards to spare, is only
two yards short of the NCAA
record of 61 yards, set by Ray
Guy of Southern Mississippi, and
is the third longest field goal in
NCAA history.
But Garcia, characteristically,
didn't seem awed by his record
length. "It was no sweat," he said,
"I can kick 70 yards in practice
with a wind, 68 yards without."
He wasn't outwardly thrilled
by the NCAA career mark either.
"I think I have it because I have
the most attempts," he said,
adding that "it means a lot more
to my relatives."
Friendly Spirits
The record also meant a lot to
the record-holder's holder, Max

Goldstein. "I knew about the
record because Max continually
reminds me of it," Rod said.
"Max and my center, Rudy
Bergthold, are my spiritual
advisers."
USC coach John McKay is
another believer in Garcia's
ability, mumbling, "He never
misses any against us." In three
years, Garcia has kicked eight of
11 field goals attempted against
the Trojans.
Earlier this year, Garcia did
miss some shorter kicks, and
blamed these on "a lack of
concentration." In previous years,
he had an even more concise
explanation for misses: "gravity."
Against The Wall
Reporters backed the 5-9, 165
pound senior against the wall as
he left the showers Saturday, and
Rod began the interview by
calling himself "the most
misquoted person in California."
A few moments later, he left
himself wide open to
misquotation when he answered a
question about losing the
spotlight to USC's Chris
Limahelu, who booted the
winning field goal with three
seconds to play. "I don't give a
shit about the spotlight... I just
wanted to win."
But even in defeat, and even
though he seemed to be trying,
Garcia couldn't stop some
exuberance from shining through
in the forms of smiles and words.
"This was a great game," he
said. "It was very similar to the
1972 Rose Bowl [which Stanford
won on a 31-yard Garcia field
goal]. Only the outcome was
different."
In his final two games, Garcia
will attempt to "keep doing what
I always do," which in this case
will mean extending his all time
NCAA field goal and Pacific Eight
scoring marks.
Another Record?
Garcia has always been a
favorite of Stanford alumni, and
some of those who once were
hoping fdr the NCAA record
Garcia set Saturday are now
hoping coach Jack Christiansen
gives his placekicker a chance to
top Guy's 61-yard mark.
After his college career ends,
Garcia hopes, with an almost
certain chance of success, to be
given a shot at a pro football
kicking job.
Garcia agrees with many pro
football fans that "the field goal is
too important," and recommends
"they move the goal posts back
10 yards, like in college."
If Garcia continues to kick as
well as he did Saturday, they may
have to change the rules very
soon.

anguish of USC's 27-26 win over
Stanford Saturday fades, it
becomes easier to recall the 59,
42, 52 and 25 yard field goals
with which Rod Garcia kicked
Bob Jacobs out of the NCAA
record books.
With his four-for-four
performance, Garcia upped his
career field goal total to 39,
eclipsing Jacobs' mark of 37 set at
Wyoming 1968-70.
In addition, Garcia's 59-yarder
is the longest field goal ever
kicked in the Pacific Eight
conference as well as the longest
ever booted in the 50-year-old
Coliseum. The first-quarter kick,
which silenced the boisterous USC
partisans and cleared the crossbar
with five yards to spare, is only
two yards short of the NCAA
record of 61 yards, set by Ray
Guy of Southern Mississippi, and
is the third longest field goal in
NCAA history.
But Garcia, characteristically,
didn't seem awed by his record
length. "It was no sweat," he said,
"I can kick 70 yards in practice
with a wind, 68 yards without."
He wasn't outwardly thrilled
by the NCAA career mark either.
"I think I have it because I have
the most attempts," he said,
adding that "it means a lot more
to my relatives."
Friendly Spirits
The record also meant a lot to
the record-holder's holder, Max

Goldstein. "I knew about the
record because Max continually
reminds me of it," Rod said.
"Max and my center, Rudy
Bergthold, are my spiritual
advisers."
USC coach John McKay is
another believer in Garcia's
ability, mumbling, "He never
misses any against us." In three
years, Garcia has kicked eight of
11 field goals attempted against
the Trojans.
Earlier this year, Garcia did
miss some shorter kicks, and
blamed these on "a lack of
concentration." In previous years,
he had an even more concise
explanation for misses: "gravity."
Against The Wall
Reporters backed the 5-9, 165
pound senior against the wall as
he left the showers Saturday, and
Rod began the interview by
calling himself "the most
misquoted person in California."
A few moments later, he left
himself wide open to
misquotation when he answered a
question about losing the
spotlight to USC's Chris
Limahelu, who booted the
winning field goal with three
seconds to play. "I don't give a
shit about the spotlight... I just
wanted to win."
But even in defeat, and even
though he seemed to be trying,
Garcia couldn't stop some
exuberance from shining through
in the forms of smiles and words.
"This was a great game," he
said. "It was very similar to the
1972 Rose Bowl [which Stanford
won on a 31-yard Garcia field
goal]. Only the outcome was
different."
In his final two games, Garcia
will attempt to "keep doing what
I always do," which in this case
will mean extending his all time
NCAA field goal and Pacific Eight
scoring marks.
Another Record?
Garcia has always been a
favorite of Stanford alumni, and
some of those who once were
hoping fdr the NCAA record
Garcia set Saturday are now
hoping coach Jack Christiansen
gives his placekicker a chance to
top Guy's 61-yard mark.
After his college career ends,
Garcia hopes, with an almost
certain chance of success, to be
given a shot at a pro football
kicking job.
Garcia agrees with many pro
football fans that "the field goal is
too important," and recommends
"they move the goal posts back
10 yards, like in college."
If Garcia continues to kick as
well as he did Saturday, they may
have to change the rules very
soon.
