# Fired Up JV Wins, 41—10
## Cordova Passes Ground Trobabes 
### TIM FERGUSON 
LOS ANGELES - The man
many in the athletic department
think will someday lead Stanford
back to glorious days on the
gridiron had his finest day of the
season Friday as the fired-up Card
junior varsity stomped its USC
counterpart, 41-10.
Freshman quarterback Mike
Cordova completed 21 of 38
passes for 292 yards and five
touchdowns as Gunther
Cunningham's squad played by far
its best game of the season and
improved its record to 3-1.
"We promised ourselves we'd
never lose again after UCLA,"
Cunningham said afterward.
Stanford dominated the Bruins in
its season opener but lost, 24-13.
"We showed 'em ... we took it
to 'em," said the overjoyed coach
after his biggest win. "I've never
seen a harder-hitting game. It was
so physical out there it was
unbelievable."
For his part, Cordova preferred
his performance Friday to his
280-yard game against UCLA

because "it's always better when
you win."
Flanker Jim Jenke was
Cordova's favorite receiver,
catching nine passes for 138 yards
and three touchdowns. Jenke and
Dave Nagler both made incredible
catches that left Cunningham at a
loss for words to describe his
receiving corps. "The
receivers ... what can you say?"
was all he could.
Cunningham credited his
offense with showing tremendous
"poise," particularly in a
touchdown drive just prior to
halftime which crossed 65 yards
in 39 seconds and which, by
putting the Cards ahead 14-3,
finished off the Trobabes for all
intents and purposes.
'Unbelievable Control'
"Mike's [Cordova] control [of
the team] was unbelievable," said
Cunningham. "I think
Mike's .. . great."
Indeed he was, riddling the SC
secondary throughout the game in
the overcast, smoggy Los Angeles
Coliseum despite intense pressure

from mammoth Trobabe
linebackers like Matt Taylor.
"Their linebackers were twice
as big as UCLA's," Cunningham
exaggerated. "I didn't know
whether Mike could even see over
them."
But even a squad of Goliaths
might have had difficulty stopping
Stanford on this day, so
emotional were the Cardinals.
Cunningham said he'd never seen
a team more so, that every player
had shown up on time for the
6:15 a.m. bus to Southern
California, and that his team was
"so quiet" on the trip down that
he felt confident for the first time
this season.
Stanford started slowly,
stalling on its first two drives, but
got moving after Rick Brandt
made the first of three Card
interceptions.
Third Down Success
Cordova marched the team 68
yards in 13 plays, converting on
third down situations three times.
Cunningham credited his
quarterback for "clutch calls on
third down" throughout the
game. The final call of this drive
was an 11-yard pass to Nagler,
who made a leaping reception on
the edge of the end zone.
Chip Underwood converted for
the first of five of six times during
the game.
USC and Stanford then traded
punts twice, with Cardinal Tom
Lynn's second effort traveling an
incredible 80 yards. Lynn
averaged 50.0 yards for seven
punts in the game.
Backed up to their own two,
the Trobabes got out of trouble
when their own punter, Jimmy
Lucas, booted a 53-yarder.
USC was unable to mount a
drive until the final minutes of the
second quarter. Cunningham
strongly praised his defense after
the game, saying it had seen no
film of the Trobabes and had
practiced a maximum of 20
minutes per day during the week,
yet still held USC to 102 yards
total offense in the first half.
Only when noseguard Art

Estrada, who played another
standout game, left the contest
with an injury did the Trobabes
move. They plowed to the
Stanford two, where defensive
end Greg Dowson tossed back
Trojan tailback Ed Gilliam for a
two-yard loss. One penalty later,
USC had to settle for a 26-yard
field goal.
With only 44 seconds left in
the half, Trojan coaches were
yelling at their team to let
Stanford tally first downs on the
ensuing drive and run out the
clock. Instead, after five plays,
Cordova found end Jim Erickson
open over the middle, and
Erickson scrambled past a key
block to a 38-yard touchdown.
Only five seconds remained in
the half, and Stanford further
demoralized the Trojans by
recovering an onside kick prior to
intermission.
David Farmer returned the
second half kickoff 45 yards for
the Trojans, but USC went
nowhere and, after a short punt,
Stanford was on the move again.
Mixing runs and short passes
beautifully, Cordova drove the
Cards 76 yards in 15 plays, finally
hitting Jenke on a 9-yard
touchdown. After the conversion,
Stanford led, 21-3.
Exhorts Troops
USC then marched to the
Cardinal 20, where the defense
firmed again as Cunningham
charged onto the field to exhort
his troops.
The joy was short-lived, as the

Trobabes went 58 yards for a
touchdown on their next drive.
Bernard Tarver, about whom
Cunningham had expressed
pre-game fears, ran 27 yards for
the TD.
From that point on, however,
the game was all Stanford.
Cordova's finest play of the day
came on the next drive when,
trapped by a rush while rolling
out, he reversed field and threw a
42-yard strike to Jenke for a
touchdown.
An interception by John
Olenchalk got Stanford the ball
right back in Trojan territory, and
before long Cordova and Jenke
had connected again and the
Cards led, 34-10.
Soon, after Tarver fumbled a
Lynn punt on his own 20,
Stanford was in scoring position
again. Fullback Andy Kolesnikow
was rewarded for a dayfull of
blocking with a one-yard TD
burst.
The stunning rout completed,
the Stanford locker room was the
scene of quiet jubilation.
Cunningham was savoring the
taste of a big win, but also was
eyeing a game he perhaps
anticipates even more: a
November 23 meeting with
California.
"This is a stepping stone"
toward a win over Cal, he said,
but for many of the Cardinals a
31-point win over their hated
rivals seemed more like the rock
of Gibraltar.
