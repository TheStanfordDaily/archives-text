# Hooters Splash To Scoreless Draw
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The Stanford and University of
Pacific soccer teams battled to a
0-0 tie Saturday on slippery Harry
Maloney Field. The scoreless game
moved the Card's record to 9-4-2,
and left their playoff chances
uncertain.
Coach Fred Priddle said his
team dominated the game and
"pounded their [UOP's] goal"
but were unable to get on the
scoreboard. He praised the UOP
goalie for making many good
saves to preserve the tie.
Priddle said that the
precipitation hurt both teams,
with a slippery ball and muddy
field partly responsible for the
lack of scoring.
He added that UOP "played
for a tie" which would look good
for them, but slightly hurt the
Card's playoff chance.
Priddle, along with California
coach Bob DeGrazia and San Jose
State coach Julius Menendez,
make up the West Coast Selection
Board, which will choose four
teams from the area for the
NCAA playoffs.
The three men will meet on
Nov. 19 to decide which teams
will particioate in the playoffs and

earn the right to play the top
team in the Midwest.
Currently, USF, UCLA and
Washington are assured of being
chosen, with the fourth spot up
for grabs between the Cards, San
Jose and Santa Clara. Stanford
beat San Jose 1-0 to open the
season, but lost to Santa Clara 2-1
in the Card's only defeat in their
last ten outings.
During that period they have
won seven and played two
scoreless ties, allowing eight goals
while scoring 28. Saturday's game
was the seventh time that the
Cards, led by Goalie Walt Harris,
have shutout their opposition.
Wednesday at 3 p.m., Stanford
travels to Mountain View to take
on St. Patrick's, which beat UOP
earlier in the year. Priddle
commented that the field the
teams will play on is "atrocious"
because of a one degree slope.
"The team that is going
downhill tends to get the most,
goals," he added.
The Cards will need a win to
stay in thy playoff picture.
Stanford will conclude its season
Saturday against Westmont, a
quality team which could qualify
for the small college playoffs.
