# Israel, Egypt Sign Cease-Fire, Plan International Peace Talks
## 
### Associated Press 
Israeli and Egyptian generals met
amid the rubble of war yesterday and
in a matter of minutes signed a
U.S.-inspired truce aimed at bringing
peace to their troubled lands.
The milestone pact marked the first
such formal Arab-Israeli accord since
the 1949 Rhodes armistice. It
strengthened the fragile cease-fire on
the Suez Canal and opened the way
for an international conference
designed to bring permanent peace to
the Middle East. Arabs and Israelis
have fought four wars since the birth
of Israel in 1948.
Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv, assistant
Israeli chief of staff and adviser to
Premier Golda Meir, signed for the
Jewish state. The signer for Egypt was
Maj. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Ghani
Gamazy, second-ranking officer in the
Egyptian army.
"We have taken the first step on the
long and difficult road that leads to a
settlement of the conflict with our
neighbors, and to peace with them,"

Yariv declared afterward.
Syria, the other major combatant in
the October war, snubbed the new
truce deal, put together by the
diplomacy of U.S. Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger during his tour of
five Arab capitals last week.
By the time the signing took place,
the fast-traveling Kissinger had moved
on to Peking on diplomatic business
with the Chinese.
The Egyptian and Israeli
representatives put their signatures to
the English-language document on a
U-shaped table covered with gray cloth
at about 3 p.m. (5 a.m. PST). They
shook hands but did not exchange
salutes.
Looking on inside the United
Nations tent was Gen. Ensio Siilasvuo,
Finnish commander of U.N.
peacekeeping forces.
Agreements
The accord said Israel and Egypt
agree:
— to observe the cease-fire issued
by the U.N. Security Council Oct. 22
and renewed Oct. 23;
— to start discussions on the
cease-fire lines of Oct. 22 in the
framework of agreement on
disengagement and separation of
forces under U.N. auspices;
— to get daily supplies of food,
water and medicine to the town of
Suez and evacuate wounded Suez
civilians;
— to avoid any impediment to the
movement of nonmilitary supplies to
the east bank of the Suez Canal, where
Israel says the Egyptian Third Army is
encircled;
— to replace Israeli checkpoints on
the Cairo-Suez road by U.N. points,
with Israeli officers checking supply
movements;
— and to exchange all prisoners of
war "as soon as the U.N. checkpoints
are established."
Talks With Sadat
The pact was accepted by Cairo
after Kissinger's talks there with
President Anwar Sadat last
Wednesday. Israel accepted it in
principle Friday but held back final
approval for an extra day as Meir
sought additional clarification from
Washington on how it would work.
The 75-year-old Israeli premier

announced her final okay Saturday
night. She apparently got assurances in
two meetings with U.S. Ambassador
Kenneth B. Keating that the new truce
won't force Israel to relinquish its
battlefield advantages before the
over-all peace talks expected as the
next step of the new truce.
Meir appealed for backing
yesterday from fellow Socialists at a
London meeting of the Socialist
International. The gathering was
arranged at her initiative in an
apparent bid for a forum to round up
support for the peace conference. She
calls it"the next big step."
Peace Conference
The editor of the semiofficial Cairo
newspaper A 1 Ahram predicted the
peace conference will be held the
second week of December in Geneva.
Mohammed Hassanein Heikal, a Sadat
confidante, wrote that an Arab
summit conference must be convened
before then to forge a common Arab
position against Israel.

But Heikal said that during a
2 1 /2-hour meeting last week with
Kissinger, the American secretary told
him that six months to a year are
needed to bring genuine peace to the
Middle East.
"What I am asking for now is
patience," Heikal quoted Kissinger as
saying. "I am afraid of the Arab
romantic. I am apprehensive you
believe that the solution will be at the
first crossroads."
The new American ambassador to
Egypt, Hermann F. Kilts, arrived in
Cairo to become the first
ambassador-level U.S. envoy to Egypt
since Cairo broke diplomatic relations
with Washington over the 1967 war.
Another arrival in the Egyptian
capital was Palestinian guerrilla leader
Yasir Arafat, who conferred with
Sadat in what was assumed to be an
explanation of the new truce. The
Egyptian leader has said the
Palestinians should attend the peace
conference.

position against Israel.

But Heikal said that during a
2 1 /2-hour meeting last week with
Kissinger, the American secretary told
him that six months to a year are
needed to bring genuine peace to the
Middle East.
"What I am asking for now is
patience," Heikal quoted Kissinger as
saying. "I am afraid of the Arab
romantic. I am apprehensive you
believe that the solution will be at the
first crossroads."
The new American ambassador to
Egypt, Hermann F. Kilts, arrived in
Cairo to become the first
ambassador-level U.S. envoy to Egypt
since Cairo broke diplomatic relations
with Washington over the 1967 war.
Another arrival in the Egyptian
capital was Palestinian guerrilla leader
Yasir Arafat, who conferred with
Sadat in what was assumed to be an
explanation of the new truce. The
Egyptian leader has said the
Palestinians should attend the peace
conference.
Israeli and Egyptian generals met
amid the rubble of war yesterday and
in a matter of minutes signed a
U.S.-inspired truce aimed at bringing
peace to their troubled lands.
The milestone pact marked the first
such formal Arab-Israeli accord since
the 1949 Rhodes armistice. It
strengthened the fragile cease-fire on
the Suez Canal and opened the way
for an international conference
designed to bring permanent peace to
the Middle East. Arabs and Israelis
have fought four wars since the birth
of Israel in 1948.
Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv, assistant
Israeli chief of staff and adviser to
Premier Golda Meir, signed for the
Jewish state. The signer for Egypt was
Maj. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Ghani
Gamazy, second-ranking officer in the
Egyptian army.
"We have taken the first step on the
long and difficult road that leads to a
settlement of the conflict with our
neighbors, and to peace with them,"

Yariv declared afterward.
Syria, the other major combatant in
the October war, snubbed the new
truce deal, put together by the
diplomacy of U.S. Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger during his tour of
five Arab capitals last week.
By the time the signing took place,
the fast-traveling Kissinger had moved
on to Peking on diplomatic business
with the Chinese.
The Egyptian and Israeli
representatives put their signatures to
the English-language document on a
U-shaped table covered with gray cloth
at about 3 p.m. (5 a.m. PST). They
shook hands but did not exchange
salutes.
Looking on inside the United
Nations tent was Gen. Ensio Siilasvuo,
Finnish commander of U.N.
peacekeeping forces.
Agreements
The accord said Israel and Egypt
agree:
— to observe the cease-fire issued
by the U.N. Security Council Oct. 22
and renewed Oct. 23;
— to start discussions on the
cease-fire lines of Oct. 22 in the
framework of agreement on
disengagement and separation of
forces under U.N. auspices;
— to get daily supplies of food,
water and medicine to the town of
Suez and evacuate wounded Suez
civilians;
— to avoid any impediment to the
movement of nonmilitary supplies to
the east bank of the Suez Canal, where
Israel says the Egyptian Third Army is
encircled;
— to replace Israeli checkpoints on
the Cairo-Suez road by U.N. points,
with Israeli officers checking supply
movements;
— and to exchange all prisoners of
war "as soon as the U.N. checkpoints
are established."
Talks With Sadat
The pact was accepted by Cairo
after Kissinger's talks there with
President Anwar Sadat last
Wednesday. Israel accepted it in
principle Friday but held back final
approval for an extra day as Meir
sought additional clarification from
Washington on how it would work.
The 75-year-old Israeli premier

announced her final okay Saturday
night. She apparently got assurances in
two meetings with U.S. Ambassador
Kenneth B. Keating that the new truce
won't force Israel to relinquish its
battlefield advantages before the
over-all peace talks expected as the
next step of the new truce.
Meir appealed for backing
yesterday from fellow Socialists at a
London meeting of the Socialist
International. The gathering was
arranged at her initiative in an
apparent bid for a forum to round up
support for the peace conference. She
calls it"the next big step."
Peace Conference
The editor of the semiofficial Cairo
newspaper A 1 Ahram predicted the
peace conference will be held the
second week of December in Geneva.

The 75-year-old Israeli premier

announced her final okay Saturday
night. She apparently got assurances in
two meetings with U.S. Ambassador
Kenneth B. Keating that the new truce
won't force Israel to relinquish its
battlefield advantages before the
over-all peace talks expected as the
next step of the new truce.
Meir appealed for backing
yesterday from fellow Socialists at a
London meeting of the Socialist
International. The gathering was
arranged at her initiative in an
apparent bid for a forum to round up
support for the peace conference. She
calls it"the next big step."
Peace Conference
The editor of the semiofficial Cairo
newspaper A 1 Ahram predicted the
peace conference will be held the
second week of December in Geneva.
Mohammed Hassanein Heikal, a Sadat
confidante, wrote that an Arab
summit conference must be convened
before then to forge a common Arab
position against Israel.

But Heikal said that during a
2 1 /2-hour meeting last week with
Kissinger, the American secretary told
him that six months to a year are
needed to bring genuine peace to the
Middle East.
"What I am asking for now is
patience," Heikal quoted Kissinger as
saying. "I am afraid of the Arab
romantic. I am apprehensive you
believe that the solution will be at the
first crossroads."
The new American ambassador to
Egypt, Hermann F. Kilts, arrived in
Cairo to become the first
ambassador-level U.S. envoy to Egypt
since Cairo broke diplomatic relations
with Washington over the 1967 war.
Another arrival in the Egyptian
capital was Palestinian guerrilla leader
Yasir Arafat, who conferred with
Sadat in what was assumed to be an
explanation of the new truce. The
Egyptian leader has said the
Palestinians should attend the peace
conference.
