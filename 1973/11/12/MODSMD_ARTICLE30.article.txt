# Prefontaine Leads Oregon To Cross Country Crown
## 
### MARK WHITE 
On a slippery, drizzly Saturday morning, Steve
Prefontaine took one step closer to closing out his
college career with a record-breaking 28:05.4
victory clocking that led Oregon to the Pacific Eight
Cross Country championship at the Stanford golf
course.
Prefontaine added one more record to the long
list of age-group, college and national standards he
has established running for Oregon. Prefontaine
broke the Stanford course record he and Gerry
Lindgren established in 1969 by 17 seconds.
Prefontaine represents Oregon for the last time on
Nov. 19 when he heads the field at the NCAA finals
in Spokane, Wash.
Going into the meet, Oregon and defending
champion Washington State were expected to battle
for the team championship, and early in the contest
Prefontaine and WSU star John Ngeno maintained
the anticipated tight duel between the schools.
With the opening gun Prefontaine took an early
lead, but the Kenyan born Ngeno sprinted ahead of
the Olympian to take an eight-yard lead at the
one-mile mark. Ngeno passed the two-mile point at
9:54 with Pre following three seconds behind. But
coming down a hill to the three-mile checkpoint,
Prefontaine had drawn even with the 1972
individual champ.
Elbow To Elbow
The two leaders dueled elbow to elbow for
another 400 yards before Prefontaine drew ahead to
stay. Ngeno stayed within striking distance until the
final hill when Pre charged ahead to break Ngeno's
will. Ngeno's second place finish, 33 seconds behind
Pre, coupled with WSU teammate Dan Murphy's
third place showing, staked the Washington State
team to second place in the final standings. Oregon
won with 32 points, WSU followed with 36 and
OSU and Washington completed the Northern
sweep with third and fourth places. California was
fifth, Stanford sixth, UCLA seventh and USC did
not score.
"I was very pleased with my performance
today," a hot, tired Prefontaine said after the race.
"Being able to run the way I did was extremely
satisfying. The difference was that I knew that if
anyone was with me in the race I had enough left so
I could run away from them. I felt confidence today
I haven't felt in a long time.
"It's always nice to win, especially against the

kind of competition Ngeno gives you. I really look
forward to running in the NCAA's — 1 feel like I can
go all the way. And if I don't have any injury
problems, there is no reason I shouldn't have the
greatest year of my life."
Bill Daliager, Oregon's coach, was pleased with
his team's performance. "Actions speak louder than
words, and Pre's actions say more than enough. We
expected a tough race from Ngeno, and its a tribute
to Pre that he forced him to give up on that last hill.
Anytime your fifth man comes in 11th place you
know you have done a good job."
John Choplin, WSU's coach, was not as happy.
"It was a typical conference meet and a typical
WSU-Oregon meet — they had five men, we had
four men and their fifth man won it. The wet
conditions are no excuse — every one faced the
same conditions. It was a well organized meet, as
you would expect when one is held at Stanford."
Ngeno Disappointed
Chaplin's ace runner was somewhat disappointed
himself following the race. "I came into the race
trying to wear down Prefontaine, but it didn't work
and I lost it on the hill," Ngeno said. "I didn't
expect to come in second — I wanted first. I had
some trouble with my right thigh, so I've got more
training to do before the [NCAA] finals."
"You have to give Ngeno a lot of credit for
pressing the pace early in the race," Stanford coach
Marshall Clark said. "Given the conditions, you
would have to say Prefontaine's performance was
sensational."
Although Stanford's Tony Sandoval was the only
Card to crack the top 10 (he placed ninth), Clark
felt Stanford performed well in placing sixth in the
conference. "Sandy did everything he could — he
took the first hills fast and I think that took
something off him late. But on the whole, we got
about all we could out of our team."
Oregon and WSU have qualified to be
represented at the NCAA finals, and it is expected
that Sandoval and three other Pac-8 runners will be
offered berths at the national meet. Clark feels both
schools should do well at Spokane. "Both Oregon
and Washington State will be favorites. And a
healthy Prefontaine should be heavily favored for
the individual championship."
That would not be a bad way to close out one's
college career.
