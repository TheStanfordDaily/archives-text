# Cards Lose To UCLA, USC
## NCAA Polo Hopes Dashed 
### CHRIS BAKER 
LOS ANGELES — Nov. 24 won't be the only
showdown between USC and UCLA, for this Friday
the two crosstown rivals will square off in water
polo to determine which team will go to the NCAA
playoffs. Stanford could have prevented this contest
but the Cards lost to both teams here this weekend,
losing to UCLA 6-1 on Friday and dropping a 7-5
decision to USC Saturday.
Friday's game was played in the Sunset Canyon
Recreation Center's 30-meter pool, which is much
larger than the pool Stanford normally plays in.
"UCLA beat us because that pool was just too big,"
said Stanford coach Jim Gaughran. We just got tired
on defense because we had to swim back and forth
in that long pool. We just weren't able to get down
to defend against their fast break."
The Polo Bruins were in control throughout the
game, as they jumped off to a 3-1 first quarter lead.
Garth Bergeson, who had hurt the Cards when the
Bruins came to Stanford three weeks ago, scored
two goals in the quarter. Rick Gebers scored
Stanford's only goal in the period.
Gaughran believed that his team played well
against Bergeson because the Cards sloughed against
the Ail-American. Bergeson scored three goals as
UCLA improved its conference record to 3-2.
After the Trojans had defeated the Cards in

Stanford's new swim stadium last week, Gaughran
felt that his Cards were the better team. However
the Trojans proved Saturday that Gaughran was
mistaken, defeating the Cards, 7-5.
The game was tied at the end of the first quarter
but Stanford suffered one of its famous second
quarter letdowns, as USC scored three goals. Bruce
Koscis, Torn Billings and Mike McCall led the
Trojans in the period.
Stanford outplayed USC in the second half as the
Cards scored four goals to the Trojans' three.
"Stanford definitely played a better second half,"
said USC coach John Williams.
Dean Anderson led the Cardinal comeback in the
fourth quarter with two goals. Craig Van Zandt
added one goal in the comeback effort and Stan
Johnson contributed another. Cardinal goalies
Doug Tanner and Tom Cummings played extremely
well in the nets, with six saves between them.
Rick Gebers left the game in the third quarter
when he committed a major technical foul. Gebers,
according to the referee, splashed the ball after a
foul had been called on him. The loss of Gebers hurt
the Cards, as they have depended on him for help in
the closing seconds of play.
The weekend losses eliminates Stanford from any
NCAA consideration. "We'll just have to wait until
next year," Gaughran said.


LSJUMB GETS DESERVED BREAK — Several members of the Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band pause for
dinner Saturday night at a classy Los Angeles restaurant. Earlier in the day the Incomparables had endeared themselves to the USC fans by
playing the Notre Dame Fight Song and saluting USC involvement in Watergate by spelling out "USC 6, US 0." The normally unimaginative
Trojan band got back at the LSJUMB, however, playing "All Right Now" while imitating the Stanford band's disorganized behavior.
