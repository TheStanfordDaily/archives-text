Kissinger-Chou Confer Again
PEKING — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and
Premier Chou En-lai met again yesterday amid speculation
their discussions may lead to Chou's first visit to the
United States or some other clear sign of closer
U.S.-Chinese ties.
Later the two attended the ballet of The White-Haired
Girl, a tribute to the Chinese Revolution.
No details were disclosed of their 3Vi-hour session in
the Great Hall of the People, the second since Kissinger
arrived in Peking Saturday from his whirlwind Middle East
peacemaking mission.
Kissinger is known to be eager to step up relations
between Peking and Washington, and to come away from
his sixth trip to China with solid achievements in this
regard.
Kissinger believes that in the case of China, a
diplomatic relationship is built more on face-to-face
contact than through channels. This is the main reason he
has been such a frequent visitor to Peking since his
path-clearing secret trip in July 1971.
Welfare Reform Unlikely Soon
WASHINGTON — The government's welfare chief says
a sweeping new welfare-reform package nearing
completion in the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare may revive debate on the issue but is unlikely to
become law.
"The prospects for major revision that would be passed
by Congress and signed by the President are pretty dim,"
said James S. Dwight Jr., administrator of HEW's Social
and Rehabilitation Service.
"Every member of Congress thinks the system should
be reformed," he said in an interview, "but lots of them
for different reasons. That's why you can never come up
with a way to do it."
President Nixon said this year that reform remains a
"critical need" but gave it only one paragraph in his State
of the Union II message Sept. 11.
Dwight said that HEW plans to submit a new reform
blueprint, "coordinating, integrating and interrelating" all
forms of public assistance programs, to the White House
before the year's end to form the nucleus for new
legislation in 1974.
Energy Bills Scrutinized
WASHINGTON — Congress sets to work this week on
legislation dealing with the energy crisis.
Committees scheduled hearings on various proposals by

President Nixon to deal with the immediate problem, and
quick action is expected.
On a related subject, with long range effect, the House
is to vote today on the compromise version of legislation
to clear the way for the Alaska pipeline. If the House
votes to approve, the Senate is expected to follow
promptly.
Also still under study in Congress is the nomination of
Gerald R. Ford to be vice president. The Senate Rules
Committee plans to complete its work on the subject by
the end of the week. The House Judiciary Committee will
begin hearings Thursday.
Officials Move To Protect Files
WASHINGTON — Under pressure from Congress, the
Justice Department is taking steps on three fronts to
protect computerized crime files from outside snoopers.
Department officials say they expect to complete
within a month a legislative proposal and twin sets of
regulations for the FBI and the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration.
But they say the most hotly debated questions will be
bucked back to Congress to resolve.
The courts may also enter the dispute because the
department action may not go far enough to satisfy a
complaining coalition of lawyers and members of
Congress which has threatened to file suit.
