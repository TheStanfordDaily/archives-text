# Pool Complex Finally Open
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's new $2.2 million
swirnming/handball/squash complex
will finally open to students today
after a two-month delay.
The complex was used by the water
polo team last week, but the
handball/squash building has remained
closed, causing complaints from
students who saw the finished building
but were unable to use it.
J. Hugh Turner of the University
planning and construction office was
in charge of the project. "I take full
responsibility for the delay in opening
the pools. I was not about to accept
these pools for the University unless
they were absolutely safe," he told the
Daily.
Turner said that the size of the
project created much confusion in
determining the cause of delay. "I had
a hell of a time getting answers out of
everyone," he said.
Responsibility
Turner insisted that the main
responsibility belonged to the
electrical contractor and the architect.
"The county building inspector was
ready to approve the pool, but I
alerted him on the electrical problems
and it was held up," said Turner.
Turner particularly faulted the
contractor, the Howard J. White Co.
of Palo Alto, "When the job was
almost done, the supervisor was
shifted to another job and this slowed
down the job," said Turner.
White, however, disputed Turner's
statement. "There is absolutely no
truth to that statement," he declared.
Bill Cross, the construction inspector
for the University, said his records
show that the supervisor "was on the
job until Sept. 31."
Trash
There was also a dispute as to
whose responsibility it was to clean
the job site, Cross said. "So many
Stanford students were crawling over
the fences and dropping trash on the
site that the contractor waited until
the last day to clean the site," he
asserted.
Cross asserted that the contractor
finished the pool according to
schedule but that many items which
were not in the contractors original
plans were added by the University.

"Apparently when the pool was
started the University didn't have the
money for some items, but when they
got the money they added extra
equipment."
Another problem was the checking
of the equipment, Cross said. "We
can't check anything until the
contractor says he's finished. When we
did check it, there was some difference
as to the proper amount of electrical
current permitted. I found a leak in
the wiring system and I had to find
that wire, no small task, since there are
several thousand in the complex."
Turner contended, "The contractor
wasn't working the problems out as
fast as possible. The electrical
problems represented a potential
health hazard. It took quite a bit of
painstaking effort to work this out. I
apologize to no one. I accepted the

complex for the University only when
I knew it was safe. This acceptance
was subject to the completion of a few
punch list items."
Problems Developed
Some problems have developed
since acceptance as well. "The tiles
were falling off the wall of the pools,
and the filters did not work properly,"
said Wes Ruff, director of Physical
Education. "Rain water also leaked
under the cauking of the windows of
the hardball building and there was a
problem with getting phone service to
the complex," he said.
However, Ruff generally dismissed
these flaws. "They happen in any
building project," he said. "This marks
the first time that the Stanford
community has had this facility and
we expect them to be crowded with
people.

OPEN AT LAST — Construction delays hampered the new $2.2 million swimming/handball/squash complex, which will
finally open today. The University and the contractor on the project offered conflicting claims on the reasons for the
delays.
