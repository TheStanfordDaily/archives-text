# University Officials Explain Tuition Hike
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The so-called "middle-income
squeeze" will be one of several factors
considered by University trustees
tomorrow when they vote on a
proposed 7.6 percent tuition hike.
The $240 increase would put
Stanford's tuition at $3375, up from
$3135 this year.
Middle-income returning students
who are forced to attend other
universities because of spiraling tuition
costs may not be as numerous as is
generally supposed, according to Vice
Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti.
"Our studies haven't shown
anything one way or the other. We're
in the middle of a study on returning
enrollment," Bacchetti noted.
But the impact of rising educational
costs on potential incoming freshmen

has been measured. A study of
"ex-admittees," persons accepted here
who chose other schools, showed
that nearly a quarter turned down
Stanford for monetary reasons. The
vast majority of these students wound
up at public institutions, primarily
UC-Davis and UC-Berkeley.
"The number is not extremely
large, but it is significant and we do
consider it," Bacchetti said.
Greater Increase
Stanford's $240 increase will be
greater than for any major private
university except MIT. But statistics
show that those two schools have
lagged behind in tuition charged, only
recently approaching the average.
"[One] criterion we consider is
projected tuition elsewhere. Here,
we're a little behind the Ivy League
schools and a little ahead of our other
main competition — schools who
enroll 10 or more ex-admittees,"
Bacchetti claimed.
The ASSU Senate has passed a
resolution calling for a six percent
maximum increase. Bacchetti hinted
that University finances would be hurt
if such a guideline were implemented
by the trustees.
"We do know the budget will be
very tight with the 7.6 percent
increase. The [ASSU] reduction
would be about $400,000. That's no
small change," he commented.
Students on financial aid will have
to bear an average of $160 of the
proposed $240 hike. According to one
University publication, the "ratio of
one dollar in every three ... being
offset in scholarship aid from some
source continues to hold." This
analysis was disputed by Frank
Newman, director of University
Relations.
Biggest Sources
Newman contended that the figure
underestimates the actual amount of
student aid available because it does
not include money from the GI Bill or
good to direct a small percentage of
the price of gasoline into research to
investigate methods of reducing the
adverse effects of gasoline, he said.
"We've been negotiating too long,"
Thompson said. "When the
Environmental Protection Agency
negotiates with the auto industry, the
latter always comes out ahead because
it mobilizes its vast resources and
overwhelms the environmentalists. It
isn't a fair fight.
"It's a clever idiom to suggest
negotiation rather than administration.
But if Congress hadn't passed
regulatory measures, the auto industry
would never have introduced such
reforms as mandatory safety belts."
Less Heat
Heating buildings at 68 degrees
rather than 74 is also a fine idea,
Thompson said. Not only does it save
energy, but it's healthier, and better
for the environment, he noted.
The creation of more urban mass

transit systems would also be a major
advance in the struggle to reduce
energy consumption, Thompson
stated.
One of the reasons why many
citizens do not utilize public
transportation facilities is that they
don't know how to use them, he said.
For this reason, a group of Stanford
students and professors established the
Stanford Transportation Information
System in Oakland. Telephones have
been installed downtown and people
are able to dial information regarding
bus schedules.
Thompson also said more bicycle
lanes are needed also. While some
cities such as Palo Alto have a good
system, others such as San Francisco
still make no provisions for bike riders,
he remarked.
Second-Class Citizens
"As long as bike riders are treated
like second-class citizens, the situation
won't change," he said. "We need to
work out a system whereby bicycles

can be transported aboard trains, buses
and airplanes."
Frank Dickson, professor of
geology, agreed that society's values
will have to change if the energy crisis
is to be dealt with effectively.
"The economic problem of society
is to reduce the absolute level of
energy consumption and yet maintain
advanced ways of living," Dickson
said. "If alternative sources of energy
aren't discovered and utilized,
society's attitudes toward
consumption of energy will have to be
transformed."
Rather than overemphasizing the
energy problem, Nixon's speech
probably understated the dilemma,
Dickson noted.
"The President is almost too
optimistic about the abundance of
natural gas reserves," Dickson said.
"Everyone who estimates the quantity
of gas reserves is worried. Oil and gas
can't remain our base of fuel for more
than 20 more years."

would be about $400,000. That's no
small change," he commented.
Students on financial aid will have
to bear an average of $160 of the
proposed $240 hike. According to one
University publication, the "ratio of
one dollar in every three ... being
offset in scholarship aid from some
source continues to hold." This
analysis was disputed by Frank
Newman, director of University
Relations.
Biggest Sources
Newman contended that the figure
underestimates the actual amount of
student aid available because it does
not include money from the GI Bill or
good to direct a small percentage of
the price of gasoline into research to
investigate methods of reducing the
adverse effects of gasoline, he said.
"We've been negotiating too long,"
Thompson said. "When the
Environmental Protection Agency
negotiates with the auto industry, the
latter always comes out ahead because
it mobilizes its vast resources and
overwhelms the environmentalists. It
isn't a fair fight.
"It's a clever idiom to suggest
negotiation rather than administration.
But if Congress hadn't passed
regulatory measures, the auto industry
would never have introduced such
reforms as mandatory safety belts."
Less Heat
Heating buildings at 68 degrees
rather than 74 is also a fine idea,
Thompson said. Not only does it save
energy, but it's healthier, and better
for the environment, he noted.
The creation of more urban mass

transit systems would also be a major
advance in the struggle to reduce
energy consumption, Thompson
stated.
One of the reasons why many
citizens do not utilize public
transportation facilities is that they
don't know how to use them, he said.
For this reason, a group of Stanford
students and professors established the
Stanford Transportation Information
System in Oakland. Telephones have
been installed downtown and people
are able to dial information regarding
bus schedules.
Thompson also said more bicycle
lanes are needed also. While some
cities such as Palo Alto have a good
system, others such as San Francisco
still make no provisions for bike riders,
he remarked.
Second-Class Citizens
"As long as bike riders are treated
like second-class citizens, the situation
won't change," he said. "We need to
work out a system whereby bicycles

can be transported aboard trains, buses
and airplanes."
Frank Dickson, professor of
geology, agreed that society's values
will have to change if the energy crisis
is to be dealt with effectively.
"The economic problem of society
is to reduce the absolute level of
energy consumption and yet maintain
advanced ways of living," Dickson
said. "If alternative sources of energy
aren't discovered and utilized,
society's attitudes toward
consumption of energy will have to be
transformed."
Rather than overemphasizing the
energy problem, Nixon's speech
probably understated the dilemma,
Dickson noted.
"The President is almost too
optimistic about the abundance of
natural gas reserves," Dickson said.
"Everyone who estimates the quantity
of gas reserves is worried. Oil and gas
can't remain our base of fuel for more
than 20 more years."
The so-called "middle-income
squeeze" will be one of several factors
considered by University trustees
tomorrow when they vote on a
proposed 7.6 percent tuition hike.
The $240 increase would put
Stanford's tuition at $3375, up from
$3135 this year.
Middle-income returning students
who are forced to attend other
universities because of spiraling tuition
costs may not be as numerous as is
generally supposed, according to Vice
Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti.
"Our studies haven't shown
anything one way or the other. We're
in the middle of a study on returning
enrollment," Bacchetti noted.
But the impact of rising educational
costs on potential incoming freshmen

has been measured. A study of
"ex-admittees," persons accepted here
who chose other schools, showed
that nearly a quarter turned down
Stanford for monetary reasons. The
vast majority of these students wound
up at public institutions, primarily
UC-Davis and UC-Berkeley.
"The number is not extremely
large, but it is significant and we do
consider it," Bacchetti said.
Greater Increase
Stanford's $240 increase will be
greater than for any major private
university except MIT. But statistics
show that those two schools have
lagged behind in tuition charged, only
recently approaching the average.
"[One] criterion we consider is
projected tuition elsewhere. Here,
we're a little behind the Ivy League
schools and a little ahead of our other
main competition — schools who
enroll 10 or more ex-admittees,"
Bacchetti claimed.
The ASSU Senate has passed a
resolution calling for a six percent
maximum increase. Bacchetti hinted
that University finances would be hurt
if such a guideline were implemented
by the trustees.
"We do know the budget will be
very tight with the 7.6 percent
increase. The [ASSU] reduction
would be about $400,000. That's no

lanes are needed also. While some
cities such as Palo Alto have a good
system, others such as San Francisco
still make no provisions for bike riders,
he remarked.
Second-Class Citizens
"As long as bike riders are treated
like second-class citizens, the situation
won't change," he said. "We need to
work out a system whereby bicycles

can be transported aboard trains, buses
and airplanes."
Frank Dickson, professor of
geology, agreed that society's values
will have to change if the energy crisis
is to be dealt with effectively.
"The economic problem of society
is to reduce the absolute level of
energy consumption and yet maintain
advanced ways of living," Dickson
said. "If alternative sources of energy
aren't discovered and utilized,
society's attitudes toward
consumption of energy will have to be
transformed."
Rather than overemphasizing the
energy problem, Nixon's speech
probably understated the dilemma,
Dickson noted.
"The President is almost too
optimistic about the abundance of
natural gas reserves," Dickson said.
"Everyone who estimates the quantity
of gas reserves is worried. Oil and gas
can't remain our base of fuel for more
than 20 more years."
The so-called "middle-income
squeeze" will be one of several factors
considered by University trustees
tomorrow when they vote on a
proposed 7.6 percent tuition hike.
The $240 increase would put
Stanford's tuition at $3375, up from
$3135 this year.
Middle-income returning students
who are forced to attend other
universities because of spiraling tuition
costs may not be as numerous as is
generally supposed, according to Vice
Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti.
"Our studies haven't shown
anything one way or the other. We're
in the middle of a study on returning
enrollment," Bacchetti noted.
But the impact of rising educational
costs on potential incoming freshmen

has been measured. A study of
"ex-admittees," persons accepted here
who chose other schools, showed
that nearly a quarter turned down
Stanford for monetary reasons. The
vast majority of these students wound
up at public institutions, primarily
UC-Davis and UC-Berkeley.
"The number is not extremely
large, but it is significant and we do
consider it," Bacchetti said.
Greater Increase
Stanford's $240 increase will be
greater than for any major private
university except MIT. But statistics
show that those two schools have
lagged behind in tuition charged, only
recently approaching the average.
"[One] criterion we consider is
projected tuition elsewhere. Here,
we're a little behind the Ivy League
schools and a little ahead of our other
main competition — schools who
enroll 10 or more ex-admittees,"
Bacchetti claimed.
The ASSU Senate has passed a
resolution calling for a six percent
maximum increase. Bacchetti hinted
that University finances would be hurt
if such a guideline were implemented
by the trustees.
"We do know the budget will be
very tight with the 7.6 percent
increase. The [ASSU] reduction
would be about $400,000. That's no
small change," he commented.
Students on financial aid will have
to bear an average of $160 of the
proposed $240 hike. According to one
University publication, the "ratio of
one dollar in every three ... being
offset in scholarship aid from some
source continues to hold." This
analysis was disputed by Frank
Newman, director of University
Relations.
Biggest Sources
Newman contended that the figure
underestimates the actual amount of
student aid available because it does
not include money from the GI Bill or
good to direct a small percentage of
the price of gasoline into research to
investigate methods of reducing the
adverse effects of gasoline, he said.
"We've been negotiating too long,"
Thompson said. "When the
Environmental Protection Agency
negotiates with the auto industry, the
latter always comes out ahead because
it mobilizes its vast resources and
overwhelms the environmentalists. It
isn't a fair fight.
"It's a clever idiom to suggest
negotiation rather than administration.
But if Congress hadn't passed
regulatory measures, the auto industry
would never have introduced such
reforms as mandatory safety belts."
Less Heat
Heating buildings at 68 degrees
rather than 74 is also a fine idea,
Thompson said. Not only does it save
energy, but it's healthier, and better
for the environment, he noted.
The creation of more urban mass

transit systems would also be a major
advance in the struggle to reduce
energy consumption, Thompson
stated.
One of the reasons why many
citizens do not utilize public
transportation facilities is that they
don't know how to use them, he said.
For this reason, a group of Stanford
students and professors established the
Stanford Transportation Information
System in Oakland. Telephones have
been installed downtown and people
are able to dial information regarding
bus schedules.
Thompson also said more bicycle
lanes are needed also. While some
cities such as Palo Alto have a good
system, others such as San Francisco
still make no provisions for bike riders,
he remarked.
