# University Officials Explain Tuition Hike

### JOHN FREED 
The so-called "middle-income
squeeze" will be one of several factors
considered by University trustees
tomorrow when they vote on a
proposed 7.6 percent tuition hike.
The $240 increase would put
Stanford's tuition at $3375, up from
$3135 this year.
Middle-income returning students
who are forced to attend other
universities because of spiraling tuition
costs may not be as numerous as is
generally supposed, according to Vice
Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti.
"Our studies haven't shown
anything one way or the other. We're
in the middle of a study on returning
enrollment," Bacchetti noted.
But the impact of rising educational
costs on potential incoming freshmen

has been measured. A study of
"ex-admittees," persons accepted here
who chose other schools, showed
that nearly a quarter turned down
Stanford for monetary reasons. The
vast majority of these students wound
up at public institutions, primarily
UC-Davis and UC-Berkeley.
"The number is not extremely
large, but it is significant and we do
consider it," Bacchetti said.
Greater Increase
Stanford's $240 increase will be
greater than for any major private
university except MIT. But statistics
show that those two schools have
lagged behind in tuition charged, only
recently approaching the average.
"[One] criterion we consider is
projected tuition elsewhere. Here,
we're a little behind the Ivy League
schools and a little ahead of our other
main competition — schools who
enroll 10 or more ex-admittees,"
Bacchetti claimed.
The ASSU Senate has passed a
resolution calling for a six percent
maximum increase. Bacchetti hinted
that University finances would be hurt
if such a guideline were implemented
by the trustees.
"We do know the budget will be
very tight with the 7.6 percent
increase. The [ASSU] reduction
would be about $400,000. That's no
small change," he commented.
Students on financial aid will have
to bear an average of $160 of the
proposed $240 hike. According to one
University publication, the "ratio of
one dollar in every three ... being
offset in scholarship aid from some
source continues to hold." This
analysis was disputed by Frank
Newman, director of University
Relations.
Biggest Sources
Newman contended that the figure
underestimates the actual amount of
student aid available because it does
not include money from the GI Bill or
