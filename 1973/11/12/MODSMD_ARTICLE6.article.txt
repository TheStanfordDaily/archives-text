# Medical School Conflict
## Admission Reform Attacked

(This is the first of a two-part series. The second
half will appear tomorrow on this page.)
The seemingly obvious right of students to
participate in making decisions which affect the
course of their education has never been accepted
by the University administration.
Students at Stanford Medical School have
witnessed a specific example of this sad situation
this fall. The existence of the Minority Students
Admissions Program and of student voting members
on the Regular Admissions Committee were
threatened with extinction by executive directive.
Fortunately, this development was leaked to
students and we mobilized to fight for the
preservation of these programs and against any
unilateral decision-making in the Medical School.
This two-part article summarizes the history and
meaning of this on-going struggle.
In 1968, after extensive deliberations by
members of the medical school community, a
minority admissions program was instituted. A
separate Minority Admissions Committee evolved
from what was originally a "search" committee to
recruit qualified minority applicants.
Since there have never been more than four
minority faculty members in the medical school, it
was considered essential that minority students and
community physicians serve as voting members of
the MAC. Student members of the MAC have
enjoyed full voting rights for the past two years. In
the fall of 1971, students were added to the
"Regular" Admissions Committee (RAC). They
have had full voting rights since fall 1972.
Opposition To Separate Status
This February, President Lyman communicated
to Clayton Rich, Dean of the Medical School, his
opposition to the separate status of the MAC and to
the voting status of non-faculty members of the
admissions committees. The Senate Committee on
Admission Policy (SCAP) of the Medical School
Faculty Senate considered this position in extensive
evaluation of admissions policy. In its reports of
1972 and 1973, SCAP reaffirmed student status as
voting members and endorsed the separate status of
the MAC.
The Faculty Senate and the members of the two
Admissions Committees assumed that the SCAP
recommendations (which were approved by the

Senate) would define the operating status of the
Committees for this year. Even when President
Lyman reopened the issue with Dean Rich this fall,
it was assumed that any re-evaluation of these
policies would be conducted in open forums and
would involve future recommendations.
A meeting on October 8 between John Schwartz,
Special Assistant to President Lyman, and the
chairmen of the two admissions committees ended
with agreement that there would be no change in
this year's operations.
Status Quo Assured
Rumors that changes in the current admissions
policy were still being considered generated
widespread alarm among medical students. In a
public meeting on Oct. 10 before over 100 students,
Dr. John Steward, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
and also Chairman of the RAC, assured students
that there would be no changes for the current year.
But during the afternoon of the 10th, Rich
presumably told Steward that Lyman wanted
immediate action to revoke the voting status of all
non-faculty members and to press for administrative
merger of the two Committees. A meeting was held
on the morning of the 11th, attended by Rich,
Schwartz, and Steward, to discuss the impending
decision.
A group of students met with Rich later in the
morning. He then admitted that he had already
made up his mind. It was clear to the students that
he planned to revoke the voting rights and to
recommend, once again, an administrative merger of
the two committees.
Rich was surprised by the strength of the
opposition to both the decision he was about to
make and the way in which it was being made.
Extensive negotiations through the rest of the day
produced the agreement that: 1) the issues would
not be discussed at the meeting of the combined
admissions committees that evening, 2) a public
meeting would be held to discuss the issues, and 3)
written position papers would be exchanged prior to
public meetings.
In the concluding part of this article, we will
bring events up to date and discuss their
implications.

by the University administration.
Students at Stanford Medical School have
witnessed a specific example of this sad situation
this fall. The existence of the Minority Students
Admissions Program and of student voting members
on the Regular Admissions Committee were
threatened with extinction by executive directive.
Fortunately, this development was leaked to
students and we mobilized to fight for the
preservation of these programs and against any
unilateral decision-making in the Medical School.
This two-part article summarizes the history and
meaning of this on-going struggle.
In 1968, after extensive deliberations by
members of the medical school community, a
minority admissions program was instituted. A
separate Minority Admissions Committee evolved
from what was originally a "search" committee to
recruit qualified minority applicants.
Since there have never been more than four
minority faculty members in the medical school, it
was considered essential that minority students and
community physicians serve as voting members of
the MAC. Student members of the MAC have
enjoyed full voting rights for the past two years. In
the fall of 1971, students were added to the
"Regular" Admissions Committee (RAC). They
have had full voting rights since fall 1972.
Opposition To Separate Status
This February, President Lyman communicated
to Clayton Rich, Dean of the Medical School, his
opposition to the separate status of the MAC and to
the voting status of non-faculty members of the
admissions committees. The Senate Committee on
Admission Policy (SCAP) of the Medical School
Faculty Senate considered this position in extensive
evaluation of admissions policy. In its reports of
1972 and 1973, SCAP reaffirmed student status as
voting members and endorsed the separate status of
the MAC.
The Faculty Senate and the members of the two
Admissions Committees assumed that the SCAP
recommendations (which were approved by the

Senate) would define the operating status of the
Committees for this year. Even when President
Lyman reopened the issue with Dean Rich this fall,
it was assumed that any re-evaluation of these
policies would be conducted in open forums and
would involve future recommendations.
A meeting on October 8 between John Schwartz,
Special Assistant to President Lyman, and the
chairmen of the two admissions committees ended
with agreement that there would be no change in
this year's operations.
Status Quo Assured
Rumors that changes in the current admissions
policy were still being considered generated
widespread alarm among medical students. In a
public meeting on Oct. 10 before over 100 students,
Dr. John Steward, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
and also Chairman of the RAC, assured students
that there would be no changes for the current year.
But during the afternoon of the 10th, Rich
presumably told Steward that Lyman wanted
immediate action to revoke the voting status of all
non-faculty members and to press for administrative
merger of the two Committees. A meeting was held
on the morning of the 11th, attended by Rich,
Schwartz, and Steward, to discuss the impending
decision.
A group of students met with Rich later in the
morning. He then admitted that he had already
made up his mind. It was clear to the students that
he planned to revoke the voting rights and to
recommend, once again, an administrative merger of
the two committees.
Rich was surprised by the strength of the
opposition to both the decision he was about to
make and the way in which it was being made.
Extensive negotiations through the rest of the day
produced the agreement that: 1) the issues would
not be discussed at the meeting of the combined
admissions committees that evening, 2) a public
meeting would be held to discuss the issues, and 3)
written position papers would be exchanged prior to
public meetings.
In the concluding part of this article, we will
bring events up to date and discuss their
implications.
