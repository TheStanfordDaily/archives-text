The word gremio is used in
Chile to refer to associations of
owners as well as workers. The
ambiguity of this term has been
exploited by the Chilean right and
its sympathizers to mislead the
foreign press and world opinion.
Thus many people were
convinced that the strike of Oct.
1972 and subsequent
mobilizations were led by
workers, when in fact the motive
force was an entrepreneurial
movement with a petty bourgeois
base of small store owners and
truck owners. The command
group which formed to map out
strategy for this gremio
movement, The National
Command for Gremio Defense,
consisted mainly of presidents of
owners' associations.
The military junta now
governing Chile has sent 11
national leaders of the
movimiento gremial on a good
will tour. According to an
announcement in El Mercurio,
Santiago's large rightist
newspaper, they will travel
through Latin America, the
United States, Canada and Europe
to explain why the military and
police were forced to overthrow
the Allende government and also
to persuade the world of the new
regime's popularity.
Industry Representatives
These men must be known for
what they are: representatives of
the most powerful industrial and
commercial interests in Chile, not
of the Chilean workers and
peasants. And increasingly not of
those Chileans who opposed
Allende, and who are outraged by
continued military government
and by the junta's brutal and
murderous repression of resistance
to it (documented in the Barnes
article in Newsweek, Oct. 8).
To counteract this widespread
and mounting internal opposition
and resistance, the junta
government has sent these 11
loyal right-wing leaders to

convince the world of its viability
and to obtain the foreign support
it needs.
But statements made by these
ambassadors of good will reveal
their true attitudes and are
indicative of what can be
expected from the government
sponsoring their tour. One
member of this group, Orlando
Saenz, head of Chile's principle
industrial association, in March
1973 praised the model given by
Brazil's government, excused the
torture and other repressive
measures as unavoidable and
emphasized the need to achieve
high annual growth rates of a
national economy, accepting
further concentration of wealth
and increased general poverty as
justifiable if they constituted the
means to this end.
Protection Of An Oligarchy
A second member, Manuel
Valdes, whose family got its land
grant from the King of Spain in
the early years of the 17th
century, and who has devoted
himself to protecting Chile's
landed oligarchy, has stated, "The
masses (in Chile) have to suffer
more pain, hunger and misery
before they will understand the
need for an intelligent elite to
have control over their lives."
It is unfortunate that the
itinerary of the tour does not
include Stanford or Palo Alto, for
discussion with these men would
surely be interesting. However,
four attaches of the Chilean
Embassy have been invited to
speak at Menlo College on
Monday, Nov. 12, at 8 p.m. Menlo
College is located on El Camino at
the border between Menlo Park
and Atherton; near Valparaiso.
The Chilean attaches will speak in
Florence Moore Auditorium, at
the end of the entrance drive on
the left.
Carmen Puelma, press attache,
will speak on the role of Chilean
women in restoring democracy in
Chile. Military attaches will

discuss the present economic
situation, subversive elements, and
illegal weapons in Chile during
Allende's government. They might
also talk about Plan Z, the alleged
plan for an armed take-over of
Chile by the left.
Panel Presentation
The attaches were invited and
will be introduced by Carlos
Lopez, chairman of Menlo
College's language department,
who was born in Chile and has
written a book on the history of
the Chilean Navy, and who was in
Chile after the coup.
Lopez will begin the panel
presentation by speaking briefly
of Allende's election and of the
forces that brought him to power.
Following the presentations of
Lopez and the four attaches the
audience will be invited to ask
questions of the panel members
and to discuss recent events and

the current situation in Chile.
This group will speak only
once on the West Coast. The
opportunity to hear the panel
must not be neglected by anyone
troubled by the spread of facism
in Latin and South America and
by U.S. support of this facism.
The panel will be subjected to
careful questioning by members
of Concerned Latin American
Scholars at Stanford. This
organization also plans to have an
informational picket at the event,
which it regards as an excellent
educational opportunity for the
concerned public of this area.
I urge all people of conscience
to come to Menlo College on
Monday evening. Cars will leave
from Tresidder parking lot at 7:30
p.m.

high annual growth rates of a
national economy, accepting
further concentration of wealth
and increased general poverty as
justifiable if they constituted the
means to this end.
Protection Of An Oligarchy
A second member, Manuel
Valdes, whose family got its land
grant from the King of Spain in
the early years of the 17th
century, and who has devoted
himself to protecting Chile's
landed oligarchy, has stated, "The
masses (in Chile) have to suffer
more pain, hunger and misery
before they will understand the
need for an intelligent elite to
have control over their lives."
It is unfortunate that the
itinerary of the tour does not
include Stanford or Palo Alto, for
discussion with these men would
surely be interesting. However,
four attaches of the Chilean
Embassy have been invited to
speak at Menlo College on
Monday, Nov. 12, at 8 p.m. Menlo
College is located on El Camino at
the border between Menlo Park
and Atherton; near Valparaiso.
The Chilean attaches will speak in
Florence Moore Auditorium, at
the end of the entrance drive on
the left.
Carmen Puelma, press attache,
will speak on the role of Chilean
women in restoring democracy in
Chile. Military attaches will

discuss the present economic
situation, subversive elements, and
illegal weapons in Chile during
Allende's government. They might
also talk about Plan Z, the alleged
plan for an armed take-over of
Chile by the left.
Panel Presentation
The attaches were invited and
will be introduced by Carlos
Lopez, chairman of Menlo
College's language department,
who was born in Chile and has
written a book on the history of
the Chilean Navy, and who was in
Chile after the coup.
Lopez will begin the panel
presentation by speaking briefly
of Allende's election and of the
forces that brought him to power.
Following the presentations of
Lopez and the four attaches the
audience will be invited to ask
questions of the panel members
and to discuss recent events and

the current situation in Chile.
This group will speak only
once on the West Coast. The
opportunity to hear the panel
must not be neglected by anyone
troubled by the spread of facism
in Latin and South America and
by U.S. support of this facism.
The panel will be subjected to
careful questioning by members
of Concerned Latin American
Scholars at Stanford. This
organization also plans to have an
informational picket at the event,
which it regards as an excellent
educational opportunity for the
concerned public of this area.
I urge all people of conscience
to come to Menlo College on
Monday evening. Cars will leave
from Tresidder parking lot at 7:30
p.m.

The word gremio is used in
Chile to refer to associations of
owners as well as workers. The
ambiguity of this term has been
exploited by the Chilean right and
its sympathizers to mislead the
foreign press and world opinion.
Thus many people were
convinced that the strike of Oct.
1972 and subsequent
mobilizations were led by
workers, when in fact the motive
force was an entrepreneurial
movement with a petty bourgeois
base of small store owners and
truck owners. The command
group which formed to map out
strategy for this gremio
movement, The National
Command for Gremio Defense,
consisted mainly of presidents of
owners' associations.
The military junta now
governing Chile has sent 11
national leaders of the
movimiento gremial on a good
will tour. According to an
announcement in El Mercurio,
Santiago's large rightist
newspaper, they will travel
through Latin America, the
United States, Canada and Europe
to explain why the military and
police were forced to overthrow
the Allende government and also
to persuade the world of the new
regime's popularity.
Industry Representatives
These men must be known for
what they are: representatives of
the most powerful industrial and
commercial interests in Chile, not
of the Chilean workers and
peasants. And increasingly not of
those Chileans who opposed
Allende, and who are outraged by
continued military government
and by the junta's brutal and
murderous repression of resistance
to it (documented in the Barnes
article in Newsweek, Oct. 8).
To counteract this widespread
and mounting internal opposition
and resistance, the junta
government has sent these 11
loyal right-wing leaders to

convince the world of its viability
and to obtain the foreign support
it needs.
But statements made by these
ambassadors of good will reveal
their true attitudes and are
indicative of what can be
expected from the government
sponsoring their tour. One
member of this group, Orlando
Saenz, head of Chile's principle
industrial association, in March
1973 praised the model given by
Brazil's government, excused the
torture and other repressive
measures as unavoidable and
emphasized the need to achieve
high annual growth rates of a
national economy, accepting
further concentration of wealth
and increased general poverty as
justifiable if they constituted the

The word gremio is used in
Chile to refer to associations of
owners as well as workers. The
ambiguity of this term has been
exploited by the Chilean right and
its sympathizers to mislead the
foreign press and world opinion.
Thus many people were
convinced that the strike of Oct.
1972 and subsequent
mobilizations were led by
workers, when in fact the motive
force was an entrepreneurial
movement with a petty bourgeois
base of small store owners and
truck owners. The command
group which formed to map out
strategy for this gremio
movement, The National
Command for Gremio Defense,
consisted mainly of presidents of
owners' associations.
The military junta now
governing Chile has sent 11
national leaders of the
movimiento gremial on a good
will tour. According to an
announcement in El Mercurio,
Santiago's large rightist
newspaper, they will travel
through Latin America, the
United States, Canada and Europe
to explain why the military and
police were forced to overthrow
the Allende government and also
to persuade the world of the new
regime's popularity.
Industry Representatives
These men must be known for
what they are: representatives of
the most powerful industrial and
commercial interests in Chile, not
of the Chilean workers and
peasants. And increasingly not of
those Chileans who opposed
Allende, and who are outraged by
continued military government
and by the junta's brutal and
murderous repression of resistance
to it (documented in the Barnes
article in Newsweek, Oct. 8).
To counteract this widespread
and mounting internal opposition
and resistance, the junta
government has sent these 11
loyal right-wing leaders to

convince the world of its viability
and to obtain the foreign support
it needs.
But statements made by these
ambassadors of good will reveal
their true attitudes and are
indicative of what can be
expected from the government
sponsoring their tour. One
member of this group, Orlando
Saenz, head of Chile's principle
industrial association, in March
1973 praised the model given by
Brazil's government, excused the
torture and other repressive
measures as unavoidable and
emphasized the need to achieve
high annual growth rates of a
national economy, accepting
further concentration of wealth
and increased general poverty as
justifiable if they constituted the
means to this end.
Protection Of An Oligarchy
A second member, Manuel
Valdes, whose family got its land
grant from the King of Spain in
the early years of the 17th
century, and who has devoted
himself to protecting Chile's
landed oligarchy, has stated, "The
masses (in Chile) have to suffer
more pain, hunger and misery
before they will understand the
need for an intelligent elite to
have control over their lives."
It is unfortunate that the
itinerary of the tour does not
include Stanford or Palo Alto, for
discussion with these men would
surely be interesting. However,
four attaches of the Chilean
Embassy have been invited to
speak at Menlo College on
Monday, Nov. 12, at 8 p.m. Menlo
College is located on El Camino at
the border between Menlo Park
and Atherton; near Valparaiso.
The Chilean attaches will speak in
Florence Moore Auditorium, at
the end of the entrance drive on
the left.
Carmen Puelma, press attache,
will speak on the role of Chilean
women in restoring democracy in
Chile. Military attaches will

discuss the present economic
situation, subversive elements, and
illegal weapons in Chile during
Allende's government. They might
also talk about Plan Z, the alleged
plan for an armed take-over of
Chile by the left.
Panel Presentation
The attaches were invited and
will be introduced by Carlos
Lopez, chairman of Menlo
College's language department,
who was born in Chile and has
written a book on the history of
the Chilean Navy, and who was in
Chile after the coup.
Lopez will begin the panel
presentation by speaking briefly
of Allende's election and of the
forces that brought him to power.
Following the presentations of
Lopez and the four attaches the
audience will be invited to ask
questions of the panel members
and to discuss recent events and

the current situation in Chile.
This group will speak only
once on the West Coast. The
opportunity to hear the panel
must not be neglected by anyone
troubled by the spread of facism
in Latin and South America and
by U.S. support of this facism.
The panel will be subjected to
careful questioning by members
of Concerned Latin American
Scholars at Stanford. This
organization also plans to have an
informational picket at the event,
which it regards as an excellent
educational opportunity for the
concerned public of this area.
I urge all people of conscience
to come to Menlo College on
Monday evening. Cars will leave
from Tresidder parking lot at 7:30
p.m.
