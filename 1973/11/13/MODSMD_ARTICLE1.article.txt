# Minority Students Protest Office Move
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
About 175 students representing
various "communities of color" rallied
in front of Pres. Richard Lyman's
office yesterday, protesting the
planned move of the Office of Chicano
Affairs to a new location.
The crowd of mostly chicano
students heard representatives of
various ethnic communities blast the
University's handling of minority
affairs and problems.
Phil Baptista, a law student who
chaired the rally, described the
gathering as "phase one" of a
"multi-phase attack against the
University." He would not comment
on any other proposed phases.
He said that minority communities
won't be abused by or held at the
mercy of a "stone-assed racist
institution," referring to Stanford.
Officials 'Betray Selves'
Baptista charged that University
officials "betray themselves by very
openly showing what their intentions
are ... [to] wipe out programs to
represent people of color on campus."
Other speakers were Carol Castillo,
representing the chicanos, ASSU Vice
President Charles Ogletree and Sarah
Sneed, a native American. Castillo said
that the concern of those present goes
beyond the issue of office space to
other areas of University attitude
toward minority commitments.
Ogletree noted that the Office of
Black Affairs has been closed since
Aug. 10, following the resignation of
James Simmons as assistant to the
president for black affairs.
Theme Houses Criticized
He criticized the minority theme
houses, pointing to the difficulty of
representing the ethnic group's
cultural background, when that group
is "a minority within a minority."
Ogletree also said he wanted to
"make it clear to this University that
as long as we're [minority groups] on
this campus, we're going to be heard."

Sneed said that because there are
only 54 native American
undergraduates, they had to "stay
tight. All we're asking for is a chance
to live as other people live," she
stated.
The rally was directly triggered by a
letter sent to the Executive Committee
for Chirano Affairs last Friday, which
informed its members of a decision to
move the Office of Chicano Affairs
from building one to building 80.
The letter explaining the decision,
apparently made for economic and
space requirements reasons, was
authored by Edward E. Shaw,
executive assistant to Provost William
Miller. Shaw is responsible for
academic space staffing.
Miller said that Shaw' wrote the
letter after carefully considering the

move "in terms of functional need."
He added that the move had been
under consideration for a long time
and that there is currently a need for
more space for staff of the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, located in
building one.
Miller emerged from building 10
during the demonstration and
requested a chance to address the
gathering, in order to clear up some
"misconceptions."
Baptista would not allow Miller to
speak, explaining that he felt the
group would not show the courtesy
that should be given to all University
officials.
No Decommitment
Miller said he wanted to assure the
crowd that the Office of Chicano
Affairs was not being moved off the

Quad and into a trailer, as one speaker
implied. He - maintained that the
proposed move "cannot be interpreted
as a decommitment to chicano
affairs."
The proposal still needs the
approval of Miller, who met yesterday
afternoon in a closed meeting to hear
Shaw and the Chicano Executive
Committee present their arguments.
He promised a decision shortly.
The Executive Committee was
formed early this quarter to fill the
void left by the promotion of Salvador
Sanchez from assistant to the
president for chicano affairs to special
assistant to the president.
Students, faculty, workers and staff
made up the 13-member committee,
which works out of the office that
may be moved.

"multi-phase attack against the
University." He would not comment
on any other proposed phases.
He said that minority communities
won't be abused by or held at the
mercy of a "stone-assed racist
institution," referring to Stanford.
Officials 'Betray Selves'
Baptista charged that University
officials "betray themselves by very
openly showing what their intentions
are ... [to] wipe out programs to
represent people of color on campus."
Other speakers were Carol Castillo,
representing the chicanos, ASSU Vice
President Charles Ogletree and Sarah
Sneed, a native American. Castillo said
that the concern of those present goes
beyond the issue of office space to
other areas of University attitude
toward minority commitments.
Ogletree noted that the Office of
Black Affairs has been closed since
Aug. 10, following the resignation of
James Simmons as assistant to the
president for black affairs.
Theme Houses Criticized
He criticized the minority theme
houses, pointing to the difficulty of
representing the ethnic group's
cultural background, when that group
is "a minority within a minority."
Ogletree also said he wanted to
"make it clear to this University that
as long as we're [minority groups] on
this campus, we're going to be heard."

Sneed said that because there are
only 54 native American
undergraduates, they had to "stay
tight. All we're asking for is a chance
to live as other people live," she
stated.
The rally was directly triggered by a
letter sent to the Executive Committee
for Chirano Affairs last Friday, which
informed its members of a decision to
move the Office of Chicano Affairs
from building one to building 80.
The letter explaining the decision,
apparently made for economic and
space requirements reasons, was
authored by Edward E. Shaw,
executive assistant to Provost William
Miller. Shaw is responsible for
academic space staffing.
Miller said that Shaw' wrote the
letter after carefully considering the

move "in terms of functional need."
He added that the move had been
under consideration for a long time
and that there is currently a need for
more space for staff of the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, located in
building one.
Miller emerged from building 10
during the demonstration and
requested a chance to address the
gathering, in order to clear up some
"misconceptions."
Baptista would not allow Miller to
speak, explaining that he felt the
group would not show the courtesy
that should be given to all University
officials.
No Decommitment
Miller said he wanted to assure the
crowd that the Office of Chicano
Affairs was not being moved off the

Quad and into a trailer, as one speaker
implied. He - maintained that the
proposed move "cannot be interpreted
as a decommitment to chicano
affairs."
The proposal still needs the
approval of Miller, who met yesterday
afternoon in a closed meeting to hear
Shaw and the Chicano Executive
Committee present their arguments.
He promised a decision shortly.
The Executive Committee was
formed early this quarter to fill the
void left by the promotion of Salvador
Sanchez from assistant to the
president for chicano affairs to special
assistant to the president.
Students, faculty, workers and staff
made up the 13-member committee,
which works out of the office that
may be moved.

MINORITY RALLY — Students gathered yesterday at Pres. Lyman's office to demonstrate the proposed move of the
Office of Chicano Affairs from Building One to Building 80.
About 175 students representing
various "communities of color" rallied
