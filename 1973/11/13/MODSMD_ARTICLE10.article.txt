# Unfair Comparison
## Israel Differs From U.S. 
### 
Lou Steinberg

In the past few years many of the arguments in
America about the Middle East have fallen into the
trap of "psychological imperialism," the habit of
looking at every other country as another U.S., with
our problems and our way of life. This habit is a
major cause of our Southeast Asia disaster, and can
just as easily lead us into trouble elsewhere.
John Marshall's recent article in the Daily is
likely to lead many readers into this trap. Yes, Israel
has internal problems, but they are Israeli problems
in an Israeli context, and forcing them into an
American mold leads neither to understanding them
or to solving them.
The first mistake an American reading the article
is likely to make is on the issue of diversion of
resources from social needs to military needs. In
America, not even the Pentagon claims that
without, say, the F-11l and the Trident, we would
be fighting Russians in Palo Alto within the year. In
Israel, on the other hand, even the doves admit that,
had Israel's army not had its expensive hardware,
they themselves might well have been fighting Egypt
in the streets of Ramat Gan within days.
In America the question is how much military we
really need. In Israel the question is, given the
military need, how many social services can still be
given, and what can be done so that one day the
military need will be reduced. In American many
military "needs" seem to exist only in the bank
accounts of defense contractors. In Israel, the
military needs, for the very survival both of the
state and its citizens, are real.
Ignoring Reality
To call Israel a society where "military
preparedness is the State's primary end," as Mr.
Marshall does, is to ignore the reality of Israel's
basic social commitment, and to distort a regretted
necessity into a desired end.
The other mistake Americans reading the article
will make is in regard to the social problems within
Israel. Yes, Israelis are concerned about the income
gap between rich and poor, but this is because their
goals are high. Israel has one of the most even
income distributions in the world, partly because of
government policies designed to keep it that way.
And yes, Israelis are concerned about crime, but
again it is nothing like the American problem.
Many people are concerned about censorship and
"administrative detention," but two Communist
parties, one mostly Arab, have seats in the Kneset
(Israeli Parliament). Arab newspapers under the
military censorship cannot report troop movements,
but they can and have literally said "Israel, go to
hell."
Censorship For Sensitivity
MASH was censored, probably not for its
political comments (discipline in the Israeli army is
notoriously informal) but because the censor felt

the gore was offensive to a people almost everyone
of whom has had a relative or friend wounded in
war. The banned Arab organizations that Mr.
Marshall speaks of are groups like Fatah, openly
dedicated to the violent destruction of Israel and
the murder of most of its citizens.
To call the problems of the Oriental Jews
"racial" in the American sense is also a total
misunderstanding. Sixty percent of all Israeli Jews
are Sephardim (Jews of African or Asian origin or
descent). The police force is even more heavily
Sephardi, clearly a major difference from the
situation in America. The problem isn't that most
Sephardim are poor. They aren't. The problem is
that most poor people are Sephardim.
Also, unlike the American situation, the poverty
was not originally caused by anything or anyone in
Israel. Jews in Arab countries lived under a double
oppression. Their whole area was under the
domination of European colonial powers, and Jews
were in turn specially discriminated against by the
Arabs.
Poverty Stricken
George Orwell visited the Jewish ghetto of
Marrakech, Morroco, in the late 1930s and describes
it as scene of unrelieved poverty and misery, "Many
of the streets are a good deal less than six feet wide
and, the houses are completely windowless....
None of these people, I suppose, works less than
twelve hours a day, and every one of them looks on
a cigarette as a more or less impossible luxury."
Even in the few countries where Jews were not
so horribly poor, they were usually unable to take
any money with them when they fled to Israel. The
effect of such poverty has to a large extent been
overcome in Israel, but the job has not yet been
finished, and this is what the concern is about.
There are also other likely distortions of the
Israeli situation to make it fit American
preconceptions. To say that the Histadrut is "like
the AFL-CIO" is to mislead as much as to clarify.
And Mr. Marshall didn't even mention the conflicts
between religious and secular Jews, perhaps because
there is nothing even superficially parallel in
America.
The cause of peace in the Middle East and justice
in Israel will be much better served by the
understanding that other people are not just
backward Americans than by psychological
imperialism.
(In the coming weeks there will be a series of
speakers on campus, and discussions in dorms and
houses, about the Middle East. Watch your bulletin
board and the Daily for details. Any group wanting
help setting up a discussion is invited to call the
Hillel Foundation, x 2345, for help.)
