Hypocritical Policy
1 * '* • »• r\c*ri 112.
Editor
I was most gratified to read of
your resolute stand (Daily Oct.
25) in favor of the United
Farmworkers' boycott of Gallo
and other nonunion wines.
Imagine my dismay when I
turned the page and ran smack
into an effulgent advertisement
for Gallo Pink Chablis. "More
than a rose," the ad proclaimed.

"Less than consistent," I aver.
V the struggle of . the
farmworkers is, as your editorial
declared, "for human justice in
the fields of California," then you
are striving for the heights of
hypocrisy — or blind to the
realities of economic power.
For while the Farmworkers'
efforts for human justice must
depend for publicity on the good
graces of your Editorial Board,
Gallo's struggle for higher profits

— and against human justice — is
assured of publicity by Gallo's
economic power to advertise.
Anatole France's aphorism is
sadly appropriate: the law, in its
majestic equality, forbids the rich
as well as the poor to sleep under
bridges. In the case, the Daily in
its majestic liberalism, invites the
destitute as well as the wealthy to
purchase advertising space.
You may very well claim a
liberal outlook in your advertising
policy. But as long as you happily
run advertisements for scab wine,
your preference for advertising
profits over human justice is all
too clear.

Praise For Ruckelshaus
Editor:
In a recent column on
American heroes, James Lobsenz
took a confusing and gratuitous
slap at Bill Ruckelshaus. As one
who spent two years in an intense
adversary relationship with
Ruckelshaus, I feel some
obligation now to say a few words
in his defense.
He is a man of enormous
intellect, political acumen, and
integrity. He is also a warm,
engaging, sensitive human being
who has (along with his wife)
grown much these last few years.
He has done things I strongly
disagree with. But during his
tenure at the EPA, the FBI, and
Justice, I believe he honestly
followed his conscience. I don't
know five other politicians in
whom I have equal confidence.
This is not to say he is without
blemish, even in his own terms.
His Indiana senatorial campaign,
for example, was in America's
worst political traditions.
Nonetheless, under intense
pressure, and at the probable
sacrifice of a promising political
career, he recently chose again to
do what he thought was 'right.'
Such acts are unusual in politics,
and are almost unique in the
context of our current
administration. I'm proud as hell
of him, and I cannot see why
anyone would deny him a bit of
applause.
Lobsenz' attack on Elliot
Richardson is more
understandable. But why focus all
the vitriol on Richardson's trivial
role in the Haig affair? As
Secretary of Defense, Richardson
ordered the deaths of thousands
in a war he didn't believe in. As
Secretary of HEW, he scuttled
civil rights gains that had been
paid for in blood and sweat. As
Attorney General, Richardson
won leniency for a lying,
demagogical crook named Agnew.
In such a record, the Haig affair
scarcely warrants a footnote.
Ruckelshaus is distinguishable
from Richardson on the simple

criterion of intergrity. The
distinction should not be blurred.

No Coed Bathrooms
For Freshmen
Editor:
While co-educational
bathrooms are certainly more
convenient, perhaps even
"healthier and more natural" for
Stanford, or any college student,
some serious drawbacks do arise,
especially for freshmen in co-ed
residences. Modesty, lack of
privacy, and over-familiarity are
the three most prevalent
grievances.
Most freshmen who arrive at
Stanford are nervous and reserved.
Many of them come from a
single-sex family (excluding
parents) and are not accustomed
to living with a member of the
opposite sex. Privacy, in such a
personal matter as one's toiletry,
is, therefore, very necessary due
to modesty. The shock of arriving
at college and finding oneself
sitting on the toilet next to a
member of the opposite sex might
be emotionally unhealthy.
When freshmen < enter
Stanford, their first, and usually,
only real contact is with others in
their residence. It is there, too,
that deep relationships form. The
beginning is a hard, and often
sexually frustrating time due to
the lack of very necessary
male-female relationships. Co-ed
bathrooms would only nurture
the problem by increasing the air
of familiarity and increasing the
probabilities of total brother-sister
relationships.
Once the freshmen are less
inhibited, are more accustomed to
healthy and natural co-ed living,
and have formed friendships
outside of the dorm, thus not
depending on fellow house
members as their sole source of
companionship, then it is the
proper time for co-educational
bathrooms.

Minority Hiring
Editor:
In the Nov. 2, 1973 Daily
article on hiring of minorities it is
indicated that I have major
concern over the small number of
Chicano faculty because of HEW
regulations. Actually, the concern
is generated entirely by academic
goals, since the University already
has more Chicano faculty than
HEW could expect on a statistical
basis. The nature of my concern is
described in the Oct. 17, 1973
issue of Campus Report.
