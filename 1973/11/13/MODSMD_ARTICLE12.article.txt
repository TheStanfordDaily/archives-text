# Arabs Burning Waste Gas, Oil
## 
### 
Arab nations are burning as
waste enormous quantities of
natural gas and oil because it
cannot be contained, a radar
astronomer here reports.
Fires at Mideast refineries and
oil fields were highly visible in
nighttime satellite photos taken
by the U.S. Air Force, said Dr.
Thomas A. Croft. The satellite
uses a scanner which senses visible
and near infrared light, and is
particularly responsive to the red
range, and thus flames.
One satellite photo shows the
brightest area of earth is
illuminated by gas flames around
the Persian Gulf in the countries
of Saudi Arabis, Kuwait, Iraq and
Iran, Croft said.
"Much power is evidently
being generated to light the cities
of the world since the inhabited

areas are clearly outlined," the
astronomer said in the Nov. 19
issue of Nature, a British scientific
journal.
"It is also apparent that, in the
process of extracting petroleum
from beneath the surface of the
earth, an abundant gas supply has
been discovered but is not used,"
he said. "Being unable to contain
the gas or transport it to a user, it
simply is burnt."
Solution to the problem may
lie, Croft said, in developing new
transport techniques or moving
users closer to the gas and oil
sources.
The astronomer said burning of
waste gases dates to the earliest
days of the oil industry, with
aviators 40 years ago reporting
vast oil and gas waste fires visible
at the head of the Persian Gulf.
