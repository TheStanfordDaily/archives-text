Iconoclastic psychiatrist Peter
R. Breggin told an audience at tlje
Palo Alto Unitarian-Universalist
Church Sunday night that
psychiatry itself was
fundamentally totalitarian in its
approach to human beings.
Breggin, the nation's foremost
opponent of lobotomy (or
psychosurgery), first outlined the
ideas about man that are prevalent
in the psychiatric profession, and
then detailed the techniques,
which he described as "murder
and torture," that were the logical
outcome of psychiatry's view of
human nature.
The audience of 75 heard
Breggin defend what he called a
spiritual view of man against the
psychiatric view of man as a
machine.
Breggin, the director of the
newly-incorporated Center for the
Study of Psychiatry in
Washington, D.C., contended that
"psychiatric oppression," like all
forms of tyranny, has its roots in
"treating humans as objects."
Breggin argued that it is
accurate and scientific to consider
man as a purposive being with free
will and capable of making new
choices. But, according to
Breggin, psychiatrists generally see
man only as an object, a
"biological creature governed by
environment and genetics."
Having this conception of man,
psychiatrists are not interested in
the "moral relationship" of man
to man. They have "no interest in
the passionate or intellectual life
of a person," he contended.
The views of Harvard
psychologist B.F. Skinner were
cited by Breggin as an example of
psychiatry's mechanistic view of
man.
Breggin said, "Skinner says
there's no one 'there' there.
There's no person in your body.
There's no one home." Breggin
noted that Skinner's argument,
like that of Freudians and of
Marxists, provided a ready-made
justification for someone else to

come into one's life and take over.
This view of man together with
the technical devices available to
psychiatrists has led to the
"atrocities" described by Breggin.
Before the 19305, the standard
theraputic techniques of
psychiatrists were deprivation,
castration, burning, bleeding and
other tortures. But in the 19305, a
technological revolution was
accompanied by "a declaration of
warfare" with advanced methods
on the psychiatric patient
population, he said. The mental
patients were now in addition the
victims of insulin shock,
electro-shock and lobotomy.
At the same time, during the
1930s the professional literature
of psychiatry shows a rising
interest, world-wide according to
Breggin, in the sterilization or
killing of persons judged by
psychiatrists to be socially unfit
or eugenically undesirable.
While this interest in
psychiatrically-surpervised killing
or mandatory breeding out of
those different from the norm
centered in the well-establishied
and internationally-famous
psychiatrist professional comunity
in Germany, it was also matched
by discussion and considerable
approval in the United State? and
Britain.-
Such prestigious journals as
Lancet (in Britain) and the
Journal of the American Medical
Association, and the American
Journal of Public Health discussed
favorably the sterilization laws
and experiments of Hitler's
Germany, according to Breggin.
Breggin provided a full account
of the deliberate eugenic killing of
mental patients in Germany, in
gas chambers from 1939 to 1941
and by poison and starvation after
that. This involuntary euthanasia
set the stage, according to
Breggin, for the killing of Jews
during the war. Because of their
early experience, German
psychiatrists also were active in
the later racial mass murder.
In answer to a question from
the audience, Breggin contended

that the handling of convicted
mass-murder Edmund Enid
Kemper by the psychiatric
profession was a good example of
the evils inherent in present-day
psychiatry.
Breggin explained, "While a
huge population of docile patients
is kept involuntary behind bars
[in mental hospitals], a man who
has committed two murders was
let out If he had been under the
ordinary criminal code, he would
have been kept in longer, and he
might have recognized that he did
something wrong and maybe he
wouldn't have done it again,
instead of being told his murders
were the result of 'mental
illness.'" ...
