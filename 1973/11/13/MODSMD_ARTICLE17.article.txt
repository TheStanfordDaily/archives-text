# Stales Gird For Energy Crunch
## 
### Associated Press 
From turning down
thermostats in Minnesota to
shutting off air conditioning on
buses in Hawaii, officials in every
state are moving to counter this
winter's energy crunch.
Four days after President
Nixon outlined a series of steps
designed to ease the fuel shortage,
an Associated Press survey of
officials in each of the 50 states
showed most had followed or

were about to follow at least some
of the President's
recommendations.
Among other things, Nixon
suggested on Wednesday that
speed limits be lowered to 50
miles per hour, that thermostats
be lowered 5-10 degrees and that
unnecessary outdoor lighting be
extinguished.
According to the AP survey, 31
states have directed government
employees to drive at reduced
speeds, usually 50 m.p.h., and
have urged private motorists to
follow suit
Thirty-four states have
deliberately cooled down their
office buildings, most to 65-68
degrees, and 25 states ' have
ordered cutbacks in office or
ornamental lighting.
Seven states have imposed
lower speed limits on their
roadways, and governors of a
number of'othbrs theV expect
similar action if Congress doesn't
act first to make the reduction
natic
New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Washington, Rhode
Island and Vermont set speed

limits of 50 miles an hour.
California previously had ordered
a 65 m.p.h. limit on roads posted
at 70.
In Georgia, Gov. Jimmy Carter
forbade state vehicles to exceed
50 m.p.h. and told police to stop
motorists who exceed the state's
60 m.p.h., no matter how slightly.
In the Washington, D.C., area,
the General Services
Administration removed 750,000
florescent light bulbs — about 22
percent — in 87 buildings, a
pattern followed at most federal
buildings in other cities. The lights
at the Washington Monument and
Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials
are doused after 9 p.m.,although
the Capitol remains lighter later.
New Hampshire Gov. Meldrim
Thomson said he is considering
asking state businesses to convert
to a four-day week to save on
heating bills. Alabama Gov.
George C. Wallace created a
special" Energy Managemeht
Board.
In Honolulu, officials
i£Sji,ifl£ted that" turntfyj off air
conditioning on city buses would
cut fuel consumption 15-20
percent.
