# Guarneri's 'Gutsy' Greatness
## Quartet Succeeds 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
The Guarneri Quartet is great.
Or — if you prefer — tremendous,
marvellous, stunning, attractive,
appealing. A capacity audience at
their Sunday afternoon
Dinkelspiel Auditorium concert
definitely agreed.
A relatively new ensemble, the
Guarneri Quartet has toured
America, Europe, and the Far
East since their New York debut
in 1965. Arnold Steinhardt and
John Dalley, both competent and
musical violinists, play with
mutual assurance and feeling.
Michael Tree's lush viola
supports them, and cellist David
Soyer's exact artistry and taste
complete an ensemble thoroughly
at home with Classical, Romantic,
and modern works. Occasional
intonation problems and a
tendency toward tense playing
don't phase them, and certainly
didn't detract from their splendid
Sunday performance.
Paul Hindemith's Quartet No.
3 opened an afternoon of
smashing virtuosity. Steely-strong
and keenly logical, Hindemith's
Quartet demands gutsy and
sensitive playing. The Guarneri
group handled every difficulty
with precision, elan, and
co-ordination.
Cleanly Drawn
Each phrase was cleanly drawn,
carefully separated yet blended
with other phrases in a
superlatively exciting
performance. The warmth and
beauty of the delicate middle
movement inspired the best
interpretation of the afternoon,
and the icy brilliance of both
Scherzi came across clearly and
forcibly.
The sixth Beethoven quartet
was slightly rushed and blunted,
though even here the Guarneri
Quartet's technical competence
and musicianship shone through
most of the time. The opening
"Allegro con brio" was a bit too
"brio," too slick, while the ideally
calm "Adagio ma non troppo"
sounded hasty and somewhat
graceless.
But the Scherzo glittered, and
the final moement was a general,
if qualified, success. Beethoven
opens this finale with a slow
introduction entitled "La
Malincolia" (Melancholy) that,
frankly, strikes me as a put-on.
Some ensembles emphasize its
sighing tenderness, some its
humorous pauses and accentuated
dissonances. The Guarneri Quartet
attacked it firmly if perhaps
somewhat fiercely, but followed it
with a rollicking Rondo that left
the audience breathless.
Emotional Note
Dvorak's lengthy A-Flat Major
Quartet, Opus 105, concluded the
program on a powerfully
emotional note. The Guarneri
Quartet's rich tone and carefully
blended dynamics brought
Dvorak's slightly heavy-handed

music to life, brightening cloudy
Slavic skies in a Czech frolic.
The opening movement, filled
with overweight accents and
passion, creaked a bit. But the
"Molto vivace" Scherzo sparkled,
and the slow "Lento" ' was
loveliness itself.
Even Dvorak's sweetest scores
aren't themselves without a touch
of bitterness, appealing if a bit
sad. Just the thing for a rainy
November afternoon. The
thunderous applause and
numerous curtain calls the
Guarneri Quartet received after
the concluding "Allegro non
tanto," however, were
light-hearted and completely
deserved.
