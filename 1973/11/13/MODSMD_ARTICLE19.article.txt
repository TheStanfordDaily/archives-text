# Kirby, Carr Show Wild, Zany Antics
## 
### JEFF GREENWALD 
SAN CARLOS â€” Thursday
night at the Circle Star Theatre
was probably one of the wildest,
zaniest shows ever to come to
theater in the round. Vikki Carr
and George Kirby both received
standing ovations, and halfway
through Carr's act, she received a
stunning bouquet of roses,
deservedly so.
George Kirby, whose television
appearances on Laugh-In and on
his own program "The George
Kirby Half A Comedy Hour" have
made him an overnight success,
started the evening off dressed in
a brown tuxedo with mirror-like
patent leather shoes, topped off
with a velvet bow tie.
The 260 lb. black comedian
talked about everything from
Burbank to Miami, and did the
most life-like impersonations of
Walter Brennan, James Cagney,
Ed Sullivan, and hundreds more.
The audience broke into wild
applause after Kirby imitated
the sounds of a giant 747 taking
off, being hijacked, and then
landing in Las Vegas.
Kirby ended his number with a
fast dance after singing "Alone
Again, Naturally." The house,
which was only about two-thirds
full, couldn't racist the offer to
stand up and applaud the talented
and very versatile comedian.
Long Ovation
When the Latina singer Can
appeared in the aisle row after
intermission, a long ovation was
given to her, even before she
started singing. She appeared in a
semi-see through light green gown
with silver sequins lining the
borders.
The whole night was riddled
with milk jokes, as Vikki Carr has
ppcently been doing "Everybody
Needs Milk" commercials. During
the second song of her act, she
interrupted herself by saying "I

drink milk, shouldn't you?" and
then broke into hysterical
laughter. Her lively and
flamboyant character on stage was
a delight to listen to, but even
more impressive was her frankness
and honesty with the audience.
Three years ago Carr
established a Mexican-American
Scholarship Fund for needy
Latino college students and the
program today has 57 students in
such universities as Stanford,
Harvard, Yale, Radcliffe, and
Columbia. The proceeds of her
profits from the milk commercials
go to this fund.
Born in El Paso, Texas in 1940
Carr's bilingualism has allowed her
to record in both Spanish and
English, and she sang some of the
songs from her new album Vikki
Carr en Espanol, as well as
another that she recorded for
Sesame Street "Tu me gusta."
Captivation
Of course she sang "With Pen
in Hand" and "Let it Please Be
Him," and during each song she
cried. Whether Carr was laughing,
crying, singing, dancing, talking,
or just breathing, she had the
audience captivated in a mystical
silence. She was superb.
"I think that the reason that
I've been such a success," said
Carr after the show, "is that I'm
not here to bullshit the audience.
I am honest and truthful, and my
audience realizes it and
appreciates me for it."
One of the many funny stories
that she told was about the taping
of her second milk commercial:
she was told that she would need
a few lawyers present at the
taping.
"I guess that at my first taping
I said something like 'Milk is
better for you than coke because
coke rots your teeth,' " said Carr.
"And before I knew it, Coke sued
Milk."
