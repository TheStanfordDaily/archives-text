# Angry At Tabling Of 'Impeach Nixon' Resolution
## Protesters Disrupt P.A. Council Meeting 
### BILL ROSS 
A group of approximately 40
protesters disrupted a meeting of the
Palo Alto City Council last night,
forcing recesses on two occasions.
The interuptions were provoked by
the passage of a motion to table
indefinitely the adoption of a
resolution to impeach President
Nixon.
The motion was introduced at the
start of the meeting by Councilman
John Berwald and was passed by a 5-4
vote, with Mayor Kirke Comstock
leading the dissent.
As the Council proceeded with its
business, a group of young people
assembled at the rear of the chambers
and began to chant anti-Nixon slogans
and jingles such as "two, four, six,
eight, we don't want a fascist pig."
Other protesters shouted, "Besiege

your local governments," referring to
Comstock's invitation of citizen
participation in the impeachment
movement.
Comstock told the demonstrators
they were out of order and warned
them that their actions made them
liable to criminal prosecution. When
the demonstration continued, the
Mayor called a five minute recess. The
recess lasted 35 minutes.
During the recess, members of the
audience spoke in favor of
impeachment and chided the council
for voting against discussion of an
impeachment resolution.
Most of the speakers were young,
but one retired labor organizer, Frank
Manfredi, a Palo Alto resident, told a
cheering crowd that "We should have a
revolution." Manfredi's remark that
"the people throughout the world are

getting fed up with capitalism" also
met with shouts of approval from the
demonstrators.
Mike Fox, another Palo Alto
resident, argued that the impeachment
of the President is not enough to
reform the nation.
"Comstock and people like him
want impeachment because they want
to protect capitalism and democracy,"
Fox declared. "But we want to change
the whole system."
After the recess, the Council
discussed Santa Clara County's "cs"
zone proposal, which would extend
Palo Alto's jurisdiction over Stanford
territory bordering the city.
Although Stanford has requested
exemption from the proposal, which
allows municipalities to involve
themselves in the planning of nearby
areas, Naphtali Knox, the Palo Alto

City Planning director, defended the
plan.
"The 'cs' zone plan will foster
closer relationships between Stanford
and Palo Alto," Knox said. "Many
people in Palo Alto are connected with
Stanford and are concerned with its
best interests."
Knox argued that the plan would
facilitate Palo Alto urban planning and
assured the council that it would not
result in the annexation of any
Stanford lands.
After an hour of discussion of the
"cs" zone, protesters appeared at the
speaker's microphone and interrupted
the meeting again. When
demonstrators continued to press their
demands for consideration of an
impeachment resolution, Comstock
called another recess.
