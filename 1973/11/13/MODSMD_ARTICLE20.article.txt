# Anatomy Of A 'Last American Hero'
## 
### K.C. FLYNN 
SAN FRANCISCO - A 1 Grieve
is a small, wiry man, with short
black hair and black-rimmed
glasses. Last Saturday A 1 Grieve,
29, flew from his home near
Albuquerque, New Mexico, to San
Francisco, took a cab to the Cow
Palace, and for eight seconds rode
a bull.
The bull riding concluded the
day's events at the Cow Palace's
Grand National, a combination
rodeo, horse show, and livestock
auction.
Unquestionably a colorful
event, the Grand National is the
last and biggest regular season
rodeo before the championship in
Oklahoma City. More than
$90,000 was awarded in rodeo
events alone in the ten-day
spectacular.
Saturday's show was rough. In
one five-minute stretch, an
acrobatic rider fell off her horse
and had to be helped to the
sidelines, and a calf was injured in
a vicious roping of its
hindquarters.
Grieve's event, bull riding, and
bronc riding are the most violent
and most exciting of the rodeo
events. Time after time riders
found themselves thrown to the
ground or up against the sides of
the Cow Palace ring.
Injuries
"The injuries are 10 to one in
favor of the animals," announced
the master of ceremonies,
meaning that ten participants are
injured for every animal hurt.
Still, rodeos have come under
increasing pressure from Humane
Societies and other groups to
change their practices. Violent
roping, electric cattle prods, and
tight ropes around the flanks of
broncs are common sights.
Modern rodeo is a highly
specialized and lucrative sport.
"You can come to a rodeo like
this one, do pretty well on the
first try at bull riding, and win

$900 or so — in eight seconds. If
you come in first or second
overall, you can go home with
$2500," Grieve said.
"The $50 entrance fee each
rider has to pay at the Cow Palace
is no more than a gamble, like in
craps," he went on. "You lay
your money on the table."
Travel Alone
There are as many as 3,000
participants in rodeo events every
year, at more than 600 authorized
rodeos. The top competitors can
make as much as $50,000 or
$60,000 in a single year. They
travel alone mostly, like
all-around superstar Larry Mahan,
who flies his own Cessna 310, or
in small groups that hitchhike to
the events.
"Donny Gay, the top bull
rider, has already made about
$35,000 this year," said Grieve.
"But he's single, he's free, and he
can do it. There are only about 10
guys who make more than 100
rodeos a year. For some of them,
it's a way to get out of the hills —
hell, anybody with shit on his
heels who can make $100,000 in
four years is gonna be a hero in
his home town."
The cowboys' rodeo expenses
come out of their own winnings.
A lot of them spend most of their
money on travel and enjoying the
life of the loose, roving rodeo
band.
Grieve tied his carefully
braided rope to his bull, sticking a
bent wire through the gate to
reach around the bull's middle.
Last Rider
He was the last bull rider. As
each rider before him mounted his
bull, a large red light above the
chute went on. Cowboys clustered
above the bull. Each rider clasped
his hand around his rope.
Of the first nine riders, five
were thrown off. Three rodeo
clowns kept busy jumping in front
of bulls, to distract the animals
from goring downed riders. One
rider caught his hand in his own
rope and was dragged a few feet
before managing to let go. The
bull went on to chase a
cameraman around the ring before
a cowboy on a horse rescued him.
For about an hour before the
event, tension builds up in the
"alley" behind the chutes, as ten
bull riders prepare. Grieve and the
others practiced rituals of
stretching, running in place, and
adjusting their outfits.
Many of the bull riders wore
identical yellow-and-green striped
shirts and brown hats.
'Playing Doubles'
"They're playing doubles,"
said one teen-ager who followed
the cowboys around. It turned
out that a segment of the
television series "The Streets of
San Francisco" was shot
Saturday. The best rider would
double for an actor in the show.

Around the ring wandered
cameramen, soundmen, and
directors. You could tell them
apart easily: They weren't wearing
cowboy hats.
Bull riding is a tense, serious
event. The animals, each weighing
around 1500 pounds, snort
fiercely as they are prodded up to
the chutes.
A large "211" was
safety-pinned to the back of
Grieve's shirt. He applied sticky
resin to his glove and rope. "A lot
of the boys aren't too happy
about wearing these shirts," he
said, pointing to the seven bull
riders with the yellow striped
shirts and brown hats.
Rabbit's Foot
"You get to wearing a lucky
shirt, or a lucky hat, and you
don't want to change it,"he said.
He pointed to his chaps, the large,
floppy leather coverings over his
jeans. On each leg an enormous
"JH" was embroidered at the
bottom.
"I did well in Houston a couple
of years ago with these — I got
them from a bronc rider there.
I've worn them ever since." He
pointed to several small worn
spotsjiuid minor rips. "Every tear
has a y behind it."
GfW*?'s turn came after what
seemed an interminable wait. The
announcer said he was "a
right-handed bull rider from
Tulare, California." Grieve, from
New Mexico, never heard him. He
climbed into a chute directly in
front of the announcer, and the
red light went on.
"You think mostly about
clearing your head, about getting
rid of preconceived ideas about
this particular bull," Grieve said
later. "You think positive. A piece
of you is very scared."
Praying
Grieve's head was down for a
few seconds,as if he were praying.
Then he nodded.
Suddenly the chute opened
and the bull lurched upward,
arching its back in a violent left

turn.
The bull kept on jumping, but
Grieve stayed upright, one hand
held high. The orchestra played
"The Girl from Ipanema," at
about twice its normal beat.
After what seemed to Grieve as
"at least four times" the eight
seconds, a piercing buzzer
sounded. The ride was over, and
Grieve jumped off the bull, rolled
once, and ran off to the side.
Within a minute, his score was
announced: 65, not bad; but not
good enough to take him to the
finals. Scoring is a complicated
procedure, involving the bull's
bucking as well as the rider's
form. Two judges award a
maximum of fifty points each.

"He bucked better last week,"
said Grieve, indicating that "Coca
Cola," the bull, could have been
livelier. Other riders approached
Grieve and told him his score
should have been higher.
Whether he won or not, Grieve
had a flight to catch, back to his
home in Crownpoint, New Mexico
that night. As he left the Cow
Palace and headed to the airport,
he said goodby to the few friends
he had on the rodeo circuit,
including a few he said were
"chasing points."
They might come together
again, perhaps at Oklahoma City,
or maybe next year at Madison
Square Garden, or Cheyenne, or
Pendelton, or Calgary. No one
seemed certain.
