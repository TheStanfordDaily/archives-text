# Dead Proves Live To Weird Fans
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Thee's only one thing wrong
with the Grateful Dead, and that's
that the group is getting just too
popular. To San Francisco fans,
they're still the good old Grateful
Dead, as much a part of the local
scene the Golden Gate Bridge or
Coit Tower. But they are
attracting a wierd type of fan, like
the one I encountered Friday
night at Winterland.
"Is that the Grateful Dead up
there? The Grateful Dead??"
"Yes, that's the Grateful
Dead."
"Are you sure that's the
Grateful Dead?"
"Yes, I'm 100 percent sure.
I've seen them live three other

times, and I know that's the
Dead."
"Well, this is my first time.
Which one is Jerry Garcia??"
This essential dialogue was
repeated at least three other times
throughout the Dead's three and a
half hours on stage, accompanied
with much nervous twitching and
leg jerking by the rookie fan.
Maybe Garcia was looking a
little different, since he â€¢''had
shaved off his beard, returning
him to his 1966-67 appearance.
But aside from"I Know You
Rider" the Dead didn't play
anything from that early period,
concentrating instead on new
material from their just released
album "The Wake of the Flood."
Since that album is very
mellow and laid back, for the
most part, so was the concert.
The energy picked up around
midnight, though, with killer
versions of that timeless oldie
"Going Down the Road," and one
of Chuck Berry's very best
"Johnny B. Goode."
Gusty vocals by Bob Weir, who
did the bulk of the singing, were
aided by some pile-driving piano
playing by Keith Godchaux on
the last two numbers.
The last two numbers sounded
so good (helped by Dead's
magnificent distortion-free sound
system) that an encore was
virtually assured. So the Dead
obliged, with "Uncle John's
Band," a perfect selection for the
thousands of Dead fans. Everyone
left satisfied, but many people
were heard to say on the way out,
"I wish they had played 'Casey
Jones,' it would have been even
better." But that's the price the
Dead pay for being so popular.
