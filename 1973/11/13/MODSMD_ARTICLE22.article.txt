House Approves Alaska Pipeline
WASHINGTON — The House passed the Alaska
pipeline bill by an overwhelming margin yesterday
and sent it to the Senate, which is expected to
approve it today.
Before the final 361-14 vote, the House turned
down, 213 to 162, a motion to return the bill to a
House-Senate conference committee for removal of
sections which broaden the authority of government
regulatory agencies.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management
and Budget, has said that he will recommend the
President veto the bill with the disputed features in
it.
But Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B.
Morton, who conferred with pipeline backers on the
floor of the House just before yesterday's action,
has said he will recommend the President sign it in
any event.
The White House has not commented, although
it strongly supports construction of the pipeline.
The line would bring oil from Alaska's North Slope
to tanker connections at the ice free port of Baldez
on the Gulf of Alaska.
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said the Alaska
Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil companies
formed to build the pipeline, expects to begin
construction in mid-March if the bill is approved
promptly.
But he said a delay in passage of the bill could
force postponement of the project by a full year
because of the short Arctic construction season.
Construction is expected to take three years.
U.N. Truce-Watchers Hassled
U.N. truce-watchers moved into a bleak Israeli
checkpoint on the Cairo-Suez road yesterday but
were forced out of another as they took the first
practical steps toward carrying out the new Suez
truce.
The Israeli state radio said Austrian and Swedish
troops of the U.N. Emergency Force manned the
Israeli barriers at Kilometer 101, where the irregular
cease-fire line crosses the highway about 60 miles
east of Cairo.
The Israeli military declined comment on the
U.N. takeover, a tender political subject in Israel.
But U.N. officials in Jerusalem and Cairo confirmed
that their troops had assumed control as stipulated
in the new cease-fire.
The Tel Aviv command said later, however, that
its troops dismatled a second checkpoint on the
approaches to Suez city because the blue-bereted
U.N. troops had set it up "contrary to Israeli
agreement."
There was no report of violence. The Israelis said
they took down the U.N. barrier after the
peacekeeping troops disregarded a request to take it
down themselves.
Small Cracks Delay Skylab
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space agency
has called off Thursday's planned launching of the
Skylab 3 astronaut? because of the discovery of new
cracks in the Saturn IB rocket.
Skylab program director William C. Schneider
said yesterday there was a possibility of a Friday
liftoff, "but trie cKances are iffy at best.
"There is some feeling by experts that we could
launch with these newly discovered cracks,"

Schneider said. "But we want to carefully check
other areas of the rocket for possible cracks. We'll
assess and then determine if we have to delay one
day or five days or 10 days or whether we have to
roll back to the assembly building."
If the Saturn IB has to be moved back to the
hangar for major repairs or replacement, the delay
might be a month or more.
The launching of astronauts Gerald P. Carr,
William R. Pogue and Edward G. Gibson already
had been delayed five days because of cracks that
were found last week in eight stabilizer fins on the
rocket's first stage. The fins had to be replaced.
Energy Bill Passes Committee
WASHINGTON — A bill giving President Nixon
emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis was
approved by a Senate committee yesterday as
Congress grappled with the problem of energy
shortages.
The emergency powers bill gives Nixon most of
the authority he says he needs to handle the energy
crisis. Written largely by Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
D-Wash., the measure provides for the rationing of
scarce fuels by priority.
It also would allow Nixon to:
—Restrict fuel from such nonessential uses as
outdoor advertising and recreation.
—Limit operating hours of commercial
establishments and public services, including
schools, to save fuel.
—Reduce speed limits while encouraging the use
of public transportation through the use of mass
transit fare subsidies and other means.
—Require electric generating plants to cover to
coal if possible.
—Adjust the schedules of airlines and railroads
and other public carriers.
Kissinger-Mao Talks Continue
PEKING — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
met for nearly three hours last night with Chairman
Mao Tse-tung on ways to improve relations between
the United States and China.
A State Department spokesman declined to
discuss the substance or details of the session at
Mao's home. But the indications were that
Kissinger's sixth visit to China would produce
stronger ties with the United States, perhaps in the
form of broader cultural exchanges or a visit to the
United States by a Chinese leader, possible Premier
Chou En-lai.
The State Department spokesman, Robert J.
McCloskey, read an announcement prepared with
the Chinese and then declined to elaborate on it. He
said Kissinger and Mao discussed "a wide range of
subjects in a friendly atmosphere."
U.S. Regains Europe's Trust
WASHINGTON — The United States, by its
action in the Middle East conflict, has regained the
confidence of some European nations, a high
European diplomat says.
"By acting quickly and effectively in the Middle
East you have regained the confidence of those
allies in Europe who had some doubts that you
would come to their assistance in an emergency," he
said.
The diplomat, who represents one of the
countries which annoyed the Nixon administration

during the Middle East conflict, insisted on
anonymity.
The rift is not permanent and can be healed,
American observers of the European scene
maintain. It can be done, they say, by writing down
a list of general principles to which all allies can
subscribe, to be incorporated in the declarations of
principles Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
proposed last April.
The United States, he then said,"has global
interests and responsibilities, our European allies
have regional interests. These are not necessarily in
conflict, but in the new era neither are they
automatically identical."
Florida Man Set On Fire
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A gang of black
men abducted a white man and his black wife,
doused the husband with an inflammable fluid and
set him afire, police said yesterday.
Brian Barfield, 33, of Fort Lauderdale, was in
intensive care at Holy Cross Hospital, suffering from
third degree burns to his arm, right leg and back.
"It was obviously racially motivated," a police
spokesman said. "The wife was not physically
harmed although she was very shaken up."
Police said Barfleld and his wife Jeraldine, 26,
were driving along a city street Sunday evening
when a car carrying six black men pulled alongside
and a man pointed a gun at them, forcing them to
stop.
Another car, with five blacks inside, pulled up
behind the Barfields and the couple was blindforded
before being driven to an apartment, police said.
At the apartment, Mrs. Barfield said, her husband
was bound with electrical cords, doused with an
unidentified liquid and set ablaze.
Segrelti Begins Six-Month Term
LOMPOC, Calif. — Looking pale and nervous,
Donald H. Segretti surrendered at the federal prison
to begin a six-month sentence for political sabotage.
Accompanied by his father, the 32-year-old
attorney arrived at the secluded minimum security
Lompoc prison camp at the wheel of a white
Mercedes-Benz coupe.
He drove past reporters at the prison entrance,
but they caught up with him in front of the camp
office and he told them he had "mixed reactions"
to his sentence. \
Segretti was sentenced to six months in prison
after pleading guilty in October to violating federal
election laws during the 1972 Florida presidential
primary. He could get out two months early with
good behavior.

House Approves Alaska Pipeline
WASHINGTON — The House passed the Alaska
pipeline bill by an overwhelming margin yesterday
and sent it to the Senate, which is expected to
approve it today.
Before the final 361-14 vote, the House turned
down, 213 to 162, a motion to return the bill to a
House-Senate conference committee for removal of
sections which broaden the authority of government
regulatory agencies.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management
and Budget, has said that he will recommend the
President veto the bill with the disputed features in
it.
But Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B.
Morton, who conferred with pipeline backers on the
floor of the House just before yesterday's action,
has said he will recommend the President sign it in
any event.
The White House has not commented, although
it strongly supports construction of the pipeline.
The line would bring oil from Alaska's North Slope
to tanker connections at the ice free port of Baldez
on the Gulf of Alaska.
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said the Alaska
Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil companies
formed to build the pipeline, expects to begin
construction in mid-March if the bill is approved
promptly.
But he said a delay in passage of the bill could
force postponement of the project by a full year
because of the short Arctic construction season.
Construction is expected to take three years.
U.N. Truce-Watchers Hassled
U.N. truce-watchers moved into a bleak Israeli
checkpoint on the Cairo-Suez road yesterday but
were forced out of another as they took the first
practical steps toward carrying out the new Suez
truce.
The Israeli state radio said Austrian and Swedish
troops of the U.N. Emergency Force manned the
Israeli barriers at Kilometer 101, where the irregular
cease-fire line crosses the highway about 60 miles
east of Cairo.
The Israeli military declined comment on the
U.N. takeover, a tender political subject in Israel.
But U.N. officials in Jerusalem and Cairo confirmed
that their troops had assumed control as stipulated
in the new cease-fire.
The Tel Aviv command said later, however, that
its troops dismatled a second checkpoint on the
approaches to Suez city because the blue-bereted
U.N. troops had set it up "contrary to Israeli
agreement."
There was no report of violence. The Israelis said
they took down the U.N. barrier after the
peacekeeping troops disregarded a request to take it
down themselves.
Small Cracks Delay Skylab
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space agency
has called off Thursday's planned launching of the
Skylab 3 astronaut? because of the discovery of new
cracks in the Saturn IB rocket.
Skylab program director William C. Schneider
said yesterday there was a possibility of a Friday
liftoff, "but trie cKances are iffy at best.
"There is some feeling by experts that we could
launch with these newly discovered cracks,"

Schneider said. "But we want to carefully check
other areas of the rocket for possible cracks. We'll
assess and then determine if we have to delay one
day or five days or 10 days or whether we have to
roll back to the assembly building."
If the Saturn IB has to be moved back to the
hangar for major repairs or replacement, the delay
might be a month or more.
The launching of astronauts Gerald P. Carr,
William R. Pogue and Edward G. Gibson already
had been delayed five days because of cracks that
were found last week in eight stabilizer fins on the
rocket's first stage. The fins had to be replaced.
Energy Bill Passes Committee
WASHINGTON — A bill giving President Nixon
emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis was
approved by a Senate committee yesterday as
Congress grappled with the problem of energy
shortages.
The emergency powers bill gives Nixon most of
the authority he says he needs to handle the energy
crisis. Written largely by Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
D-Wash., the measure provides for the rationing of
scarce fuels by priority.
It also would allow Nixon to:
—Restrict fuel from such nonessential uses as
outdoor advertising and recreation.
—Limit operating hours of commercial
establishments and public services, including
schools, to save fuel.
—Reduce speed limits while encouraging the use
of public transportation through the use of mass
transit fare subsidies and other means.
—Require electric generating plants to cover to
coal if possible.
—Adjust the schedules of airlines and railroads
and other public carriers.

U.S. Regains Europe's Trust
WASHINGTON — The United States, by its
action in the Middle East conflict, has regained the
confidence of some European nations, a high
European diplomat says.
"By acting quickly and effectively in the Middle
East you have regained the confidence of those
allies in Europe who had some doubts that you
would come to their assistance in an emergency," he
said.
The diplomat, who represents one of the
countries which annoyed the Nixon administration

during the Middle East conflict, insisted on
anonymity.
The rift is not permanent and can be healed,
American observers of the European scene
maintain. It can be done, they say, by writing down
a list of general principles to which all allies can
subscribe, to be incorporated in the declarations of
principles Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
proposed last April.
The United States, he then said,"has global
interests and responsibilities, our European allies
have regional interests. These are not necessarily in
conflict, but in the new era neither are they
automatically identical."
Florida Man Set On Fire
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A gang of black
men abducted a white man and his black wife,
doused the husband with an inflammable fluid and
set him afire, police said yesterday.
Brian Barfield, 33, of Fort Lauderdale, was in
intensive care at Holy Cross Hospital, suffering from
third degree burns to his arm, right leg and back.
"It was obviously racially motivated," a police
spokesman said. "The wife was not physically
harmed although she was very shaken up."
Police said Barfleld and his wife Jeraldine, 26,
were driving along a city street Sunday evening
when a car carrying six black men pulled alongside
and a man pointed a gun at them, forcing them to
stop.
Another car, with five blacks inside, pulled up
behind the Barfields and the couple was blindforded
before being driven to an apartment, police said.
At the apartment, Mrs. Barfield said, her husband
was bound with electrical cords, doused with an
unidentified liquid and set ablaze.

confidence of some European nations, a high
European diplomat says.
"By acting quickly and effectively in the Middle
East you have regained the confidence of those
allies in Europe who had some doubts that you
would come to their assistance in an emergency," he
said.
The diplomat, who represents one of the
countries which annoyed the Nixon administration

during the Middle East conflict, insisted on
anonymity.
The rift is not permanent and can be healed,
American observers of the European scene
maintain. It can be done, they say, by writing down
a list of general principles to which all allies can
subscribe, to be incorporated in the declarations of
principles Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
proposed last April.
The United States, he then said,"has global
interests and responsibilities, our European allies
have regional interests. These are not necessarily in
conflict, but in the new era neither are they
automatically identical."
Florida Man Set On Fire
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A gang of black
men abducted a white man and his black wife,
doused the husband with an inflammable fluid and
set him afire, police said yesterday.
Brian Barfield, 33, of Fort Lauderdale, was in
intensive care at Holy Cross Hospital, suffering from
third degree burns to his arm, right leg and back.
"It was obviously racially motivated," a police
spokesman said. "The wife was not physically
harmed although she was very shaken up."
Police said Barfleld and his wife Jeraldine, 26,
were driving along a city street Sunday evening
when a car carrying six black men pulled alongside
and a man pointed a gun at them, forcing them to
stop.
Another car, with five blacks inside, pulled up
behind the Barfields and the couple was blindforded
before being driven to an apartment, police said.
At the apartment, Mrs. Barfield said, her husband
was bound with electrical cords, doused with an
unidentified liquid and set ablaze.
Segrelti Begins Six-Month Term
LOMPOC, Calif. — Looking pale and nervous,
Donald H. Segretti surrendered at the federal prison
to begin a six-month sentence for political sabotage.
Accompanied by his father, the 32-year-old
attorney arrived at the secluded minimum security
Lompoc prison camp at the wheel of a white
Mercedes-Benz coupe.
He drove past reporters at the prison entrance,
but they caught up with him in front of the camp
office and he told them he had "mixed reactions"
to his sentence. \
Segretti was sentenced to six months in prison
after pleading guilty in October to violating federal
election laws during the 1972 Florida presidential
primary. He could get out two months early with
good behavior.

House Approves Alaska Pipeline
WASHINGTON — The House passed the Alaska
pipeline bill by an overwhelming margin yesterday
and sent it to the Senate, which is expected to
approve it today.
Before the final 361-14 vote, the House turned
down, 213 to 162, a motion to return the bill to a
House-Senate conference committee for removal of
sections which broaden the authority of government
regulatory agencies.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management
and Budget, has said that he will recommend the
President veto the bill with the disputed features in
it.
But Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B.
Morton, who conferred with pipeline backers on the
floor of the House just before yesterday's action,
has said he will recommend the President sign it in
any event.
The White House has not commented, although
it strongly supports construction of the pipeline.
The line would bring oil from Alaska's North Slope
to tanker connections at the ice free port of Baldez
on the Gulf of Alaska.
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said the Alaska
Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil companies
formed to build the pipeline, expects to begin
construction in mid-March if the bill is approved
promptly.
But he said a delay in passage of the bill could
force postponement of the project by a full year
because of the short Arctic construction season.
Construction is expected to take three years.
U.N. Truce-Watchers Hassled
U.N. truce-watchers moved into a bleak Israeli
checkpoint on the Cairo-Suez road yesterday but
were forced out of another as they took the first
practical steps toward carrying out the new Suez
truce.
The Israeli state radio said Austrian and Swedish
troops of the U.N. Emergency Force manned the
Israeli barriers at Kilometer 101, where the irregular
cease-fire line crosses the highway about 60 miles
east of Cairo.
The Israeli military declined comment on the
U.N. takeover, a tender political subject in Israel.
But U.N. officials in Jerusalem and Cairo confirmed
that their troops had assumed control as stipulated
in the new cease-fire.
The Tel Aviv command said later, however, that
its troops dismatled a second checkpoint on the
approaches to Suez city because the blue-bereted
U.N. troops had set it up "contrary to Israeli
agreement."
There was no report of violence. The Israelis said
they took down the U.N. barrier after the
peacekeeping troops disregarded a request to take it
down themselves.
Small Cracks Delay Skylab
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space agency
has called off Thursday's planned launching of the
Skylab 3 astronaut? because of the discovery of new
cracks in the Saturn IB rocket.
Skylab program director William C. Schneider
said yesterday there was a possibility of a Friday
liftoff, "but trie cKances are iffy at best.
"There is some feeling by experts that we could
launch with these newly discovered cracks,"

Schneider said. "But we want to carefully check
other areas of the rocket for possible cracks. We'll
assess and then determine if we have to delay one
day or five days or 10 days or whether we have to
roll back to the assembly building."
If the Saturn IB has to be moved back to the
hangar for major repairs or replacement, the delay
might be a month or more.
The launching of astronauts Gerald P. Carr,
William R. Pogue and Edward G. Gibson already
had been delayed five days because of cracks that
were found last week in eight stabilizer fins on the
rocket's first stage. The fins had to be replaced.
Energy Bill Passes Committee
WASHINGTON — A bill giving President Nixon
emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis was
approved by a Senate committee yesterday as
Congress grappled with the problem of energy
shortages.
The emergency powers bill gives Nixon most of
the authority he says he needs to handle the energy
crisis. Written largely by Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
D-Wash., the measure provides for the rationing of
scarce fuels by priority.
It also would allow Nixon to:
—Restrict fuel from such nonessential uses as
outdoor advertising and recreation.
—Limit operating hours of commercial
establishments and public services, including
schools, to save fuel.
—Reduce speed limits while encouraging the use
of public transportation through the use of mass
transit fare subsidies and other means.
—Require electric generating plants to cover to
coal if possible.
—Adjust the schedules of airlines and railroads
and other public carriers.
Kissinger-Mao Talks Continue
PEKING — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
met for nearly three hours last night with Chairman
Mao Tse-tung on ways to improve relations between
the United States and China.
A State Department spokesman declined to
discuss the substance or details of the session at
Mao's home. But the indications were that
Kissinger's sixth visit to China would produce
stronger ties with the United States, perhaps in the
form of broader cultural exchanges or a visit to the
United States by a Chinese leader, possible Premier
Chou En-lai.
The State Department spokesman, Robert J.
McCloskey, read an announcement prepared with
the Chinese and then declined to elaborate on it. He
said Kissinger and Mao discussed "a wide range of
subjects in a friendly atmosphere."

approved by a Senate committee yesterday as
Congress grappled with the problem of energy
shortages.
The emergency powers bill gives Nixon most of
the authority he says he needs to handle the energy
crisis. Written largely by Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
D-Wash., the measure provides for the rationing of
scarce fuels by priority.
It also would allow Nixon to:
—Restrict fuel from such nonessential uses as
outdoor advertising and recreation.
—Limit operating hours of commercial
establishments and public services, including
schools, to save fuel.
—Reduce speed limits while encouraging the use
of public transportation through the use of mass
transit fare subsidies and other means.
—Require electric generating plants to cover to
coal if possible.
—Adjust the schedules of airlines and railroads
and other public carriers.
Kissinger-Mao Talks Continue
PEKING — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
met for nearly three hours last night with Chairman
Mao Tse-tung on ways to improve relations between
the United States and China.
A State Department spokesman declined to
discuss the substance or details of the session at
Mao's home. But the indications were that
Kissinger's sixth visit to China would produce
stronger ties with the United States, perhaps in the
form of broader cultural exchanges or a visit to the
United States by a Chinese leader, possible Premier
Chou En-lai.
The State Department spokesman, Robert J.
McCloskey, read an announcement prepared with
the Chinese and then declined to elaborate on it. He
said Kissinger and Mao discussed "a wide range of
subjects in a friendly atmosphere."
U.S. Regains Europe's Trust
WASHINGTON — The United States, by its
action in the Middle East conflict, has regained the
confidence of some European nations, a high
European diplomat says.
"By acting quickly and effectively in the Middle
East you have regained the confidence of those
allies in Europe who had some doubts that you
would come to their assistance in an emergency," he
said.
The diplomat, who represents one of the
countries which annoyed the Nixon administration

during the Middle East conflict, insisted on
anonymity.
The rift is not permanent and can be healed,
American observers of the European scene
maintain. It can be done, they say, by writing down
a list of general principles to which all allies can
subscribe, to be incorporated in the declarations of
principles Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
proposed last April.
The United States, he then said,"has global
interests and responsibilities, our European allies
have regional interests. These are not necessarily in
conflict, but in the new era neither are they
automatically identical."
Florida Man Set On Fire
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A gang of black
men abducted a white man and his black wife,
doused the husband with an inflammable fluid and
set him afire, police said yesterday.
Brian Barfield, 33, of Fort Lauderdale, was in
intensive care at Holy Cross Hospital, suffering from
third degree burns to his arm, right leg and back.
"It was obviously racially motivated," a police
spokesman said. "The wife was not physically
harmed although she was very shaken up."
Police said Barfleld and his wife Jeraldine, 26,
were driving along a city street Sunday evening
when a car carrying six black men pulled alongside
and a man pointed a gun at them, forcing them to
stop.
Another car, with five blacks inside, pulled up
behind the Barfields and the couple was blindforded
before being driven to an apartment, police said.
At the apartment, Mrs. Barfield said, her husband
was bound with electrical cords, doused with an
unidentified liquid and set ablaze.
Segrelti Begins Six-Month Term
LOMPOC, Calif. — Looking pale and nervous,
Donald H. Segretti surrendered at the federal prison
to begin a six-month sentence for political sabotage.
Accompanied by his father, the 32-year-old
attorney arrived at the secluded minimum security
Lompoc prison camp at the wheel of a white
Mercedes-Benz coupe.
He drove past reporters at the prison entrance,
but they caught up with him in front of the camp
office and he told them he had "mixed reactions"
to his sentence. \
Segretti was sentenced to six months in prison
after pleading guilty in October to violating federal
election laws during the 1972 Florida presidential
primary. He could get out two months early with
good behavior.

House Approves Alaska Pipeline
WASHINGTON — The House passed the Alaska
pipeline bill by an overwhelming margin yesterday
and sent it to the Senate, which is expected to
approve it today.
Before the final 361-14 vote, the House turned
down, 213 to 162, a motion to return the bill to a
House-Senate conference committee for removal of
sections which broaden the authority of government
regulatory agencies.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management
and Budget, has said that he will recommend the
President veto the bill with the disputed features in
it.
But Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B.
Morton, who conferred with pipeline backers on the
floor of the House just before yesterday's action,
has said he will recommend the President sign it in
any event.
The White House has not commented, although
it strongly supports construction of the pipeline.
The line would bring oil from Alaska's North Slope
to tanker connections at the ice free port of Baldez
on the Gulf of Alaska.
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said the Alaska
Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil companies
formed to build the pipeline, expects to begin
construction in mid-March if the bill is approved
promptly.
But he said a delay in passage of the bill could
force postponement of the project by a full year
because of the short Arctic construction season.
Construction is expected to take three years.
U.N. Truce-Watchers Hassled
U.N. truce-watchers moved into a bleak Israeli
checkpoint on the Cairo-Suez road yesterday but
were forced out of another as they took the first
practical steps toward carrying out the new Suez
truce.
The Israeli state radio said Austrian and Swedish
troops of the U.N. Emergency Force manned the
Israeli barriers at Kilometer 101, where the irregular
cease-fire line crosses the highway about 60 miles
east of Cairo.
The Israeli military declined comment on the
U.N. takeover, a tender political subject in Israel.
But U.N. officials in Jerusalem and Cairo confirmed
that their troops had assumed control as stipulated
in the new cease-fire.
The Tel Aviv command said later, however, that
its troops dismatled a second checkpoint on the
approaches to Suez city because the blue-bereted
U.N. troops had set it up "contrary to Israeli
agreement."
There was no report of violence. The Israelis said
they took down the U.N. barrier after the
peacekeeping troops disregarded a request to take it
down themselves.
Small Cracks Delay Skylab
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space agency
has called off Thursday's planned launching of the
Skylab 3 astronaut? because of the discovery of new
cracks in the Saturn IB rocket.
Skylab program director William C. Schneider
said yesterday there was a possibility of a Friday
liftoff, "but trie cKances are iffy at best.
"There is some feeling by experts that we could
launch with these newly discovered cracks,"

Schneider said. "But we want to carefully check
other areas of the rocket for possible cracks. We'll
assess and then determine if we have to delay one
day or five days or 10 days or whether we have to
roll back to the assembly building."
If the Saturn IB has to be moved back to the
hangar for major repairs or replacement, the delay
might be a month or more.
The launching of astronauts Gerald P. Carr,
William R. Pogue and Edward G. Gibson already
had been delayed five days because of cracks that
were found last week in eight stabilizer fins on the
rocket's first stage. The fins had to be replaced.
