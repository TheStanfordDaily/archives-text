# Fairly Strong Quake Causes No Damage

### DAVE SMITH 
A moderately strong earthquake
that rocked the Bay Area sent tremors
through Quad buildings at about
10:20 yesterday morning. The shock
apparently caused no damage,
according to Plant Services officials.
U.S. Geological Survey scientist
Rob Wesson said the quake's
magnitude was estimated at 4.0 on the
Richter scale, about 100 times weaker
than the force of a major destructive
earthquake. Berkeley seismologists
estimated the Richter scale magnitude
at 4.6, a figure which Wesson called
much too high.
Most campus areas were not hit by
the tremors, but shocks were felt in
the history corner area. History
Department secretaries reported a
single noticeable shock, "just like a
gentle roll," according to one. The
quake caused no disruption of classes.
Plant Services sources said the
possibility of structural damage to any
University buildings was "extremely

unlikely." No major quake-related
damage was reported anywhere in the
Bay Area yesterday.
According to Wesson, the
earthquake was probably not caused
by the San Andreas fault. Instead, it
stemmed from an area of suspected
active faults in the northern region of
the Santa Cruz Mountains, about 10
miles southwest of San Jose. The
quake's epicenter was reported to be
near Los Gatos.
Although the probable epicenter is
about a mile and a half from the
seven-billion-gallon Lexington
Reservoir, county officials reported no
damage there or at any other local
dams or reservoirs.
Contrary to prevalent opinion,
comparatively minor quakes like
yesterday's have little or no effect in
relieving fault tensions which could
lead to major earthquakes, according
to Wesson. "Small quakes are a
symptom of stress, not a reliever," he
stated.
