# Ominous Crowds Cause Chile Speech Cancellation
## 
### EZRA GREENHOUSE 
Speeches by four representatives of
the Chilean junta, scheduled last night
at Menlo College, had to be cancelled
because of rumors of overwhelming,
and possibly hostile, crowds.
A statement released by Menlo
College Pres. Richard O'Brien declared
that "circumstances beyond the
control of the host institution" made
the cancellation necessary.
Claiming that "the program had
generated a scope of local interest
beyond expectations," the statement
pointed out that Florence Moore
Auditorium, intended site for the
speeches, could not accommodate the
anticipated turnout.
Menlo College Prof. Carlos Lopez,
organizer of the event, said last night
that, at the behest of the Chilean
Embassy, he had taken the three
Chilean military officers to the
Atherton Police Station for "security
reasons." He insisted the action was
only "precautionary."
Carmen Puelma, Chilean press
attache to the United States, was the

fourth scheduled speaker. In a
telephone interview last night she
expressed an interest in setting up a
press conference in San Francisco for
the officials, but had not finalized her
plans.
English Prof. John Felstiner, a
member of Concerned Latin American
Scholars at Stanford (CLASS), called
the incident unfortunate, but
"understandable." He said the
cancellation showed that "people are
not satisfied with the official
explanation of events in Chile," and
that further discussions were
necessary.
A number of demonstrators,
estimated at 75 to 100, showed up at
the site of the speech last night despite
the cancellation.
