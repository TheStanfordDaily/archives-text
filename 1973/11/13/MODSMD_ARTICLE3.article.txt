# Nixon Offers Own Files; Loses Subpoenaed Reel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
announced yesterday he will give a
federal judge unsubpoenaed White
House tape recordings and portions of
his personal diary file, but said he
can't locate one dictation machine
belt subpoenaed by Watergate
prosecutors.
Meanwhile, the White House agreed
in the federal court that it will deliver
by Nov. 20 subpoenaed Watergate tape
recordings and the other material
promised by Nixon. U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica said
duplicates of the tapes and other
material would be made and originals
stored in White House vaults.
The dictation belt is the third piece
of subpoenaed Watergate evidence the
White House said does not exist.
Earlier, it announced that two key
conversations went unrecorded by a

presidential taping system.
Nixon Statement
Seeking to "clear up...once and for
all" the controversy about the
Watergate conversations, Nixon said in
a written statement that he will:
—Voluntarily submit recordings of
two April 16, 1973, conversations
with then-counsel John W. Dean 111,
saying they "covered much of the
same subject matter" as an April 15
meeting with Dean that the White
House said went unrecorded.
—Allow the court to listen to other
unsubpoenaed reels of tapes to
demonstrate that no recordings were
made of the subpoenaed April 15
Dean meeting or of a subpoenaed June
20, 1972, telephone conversation with
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell.
Tape Examination
—Agree that "court-approved
independent experts employing the
most advanced technological
methods" examine all tapes in
question "for any evidence of
alterations...."
—Supply portions of his personal
diary file subpoenaed by prosecutors,
including dictation belts containing his
recollections of the Mitchell telephone

call and handwritten notes of his April
15 meeting with Dean.
Nixon said a search of his personal
diary file a week ago failed to tum up
a dictation belt of his recollections of
the April 15 meeting with Dean. He
said he thought he had dictated his
recollections after that meeting, and
White House spokesmen said as
recently as Nov. 2 that such a
dictation belt existed.
'Diligent Search'
"I have made a diligent search...,"
Nixon said in a statement. "Other than
my contemporaneous note of that
meeting..., I have found no such
evidence."
Dean has testified that in the April
15 meeting the President admitted
discussing executive clemency as part
of the Watergate cover-up and that
Nixon said he had only been joking
earlier when he said it would be no
problem to raise $1 million in hush
money.
Two weeks ago, the White House
disclosed in court that the April 15
meeting was not recorded because an
untended tape recorder ran out of
tape. Disclosure about that meeting
and the Mitchell one prompted Sirica
to begin a hearing on the tape
recordings.
Press Briefing
At a White House news briefing,
Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
that the president used earphones on
June 4 when he spent about 12 hours
listening to a number of tape
recordings. Therefore, Ziegler said, a
recording of the recordings the
President listened to that day "would
not exist." The question had been
raised in court.
On another point, Ziegler said a
meeting between the President and
members of the Senate Watergate
committee "is something we would
consider." But he added that "we have
not made that determination yet."
Ziegler said that Nixon intends to
"deal very forthrightly" with
allegations about his conduct.

June 4 when he spent about 12 hours
listening to a number of tape
recordings. Therefore, Ziegler said, a
recording of the recordings the
President listened to that day "would
not exist." The question had been
raised in court.
On another point, Ziegler said a
meeting between the President and
members of the Senate Watergate
committee "is something we would
consider." But he added that "we have
not made that determination yet."
Ziegler said that Nixon intends to
"deal very forthrightly" with
allegations about his conduct.
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
announced yesterday he will give a
federal judge unsubpoenaed White
House tape recordings and portions of
his personal diary file, but said he
can't locate one dictation machine
belt subpoenaed by Watergate
prosecutors.
Meanwhile, the White House agreed
in the federal court that it will deliver
by Nov. 20 subpoenaed Watergate tape
recordings and the other material
promised by Nixon. U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica said
duplicates of the tapes and other
material would be made and originals
stored in White House vaults.
The dictation belt is the third piece
of subpoenaed Watergate evidence the
White House said does not exist.
Earlier, it announced that two key
conversations went unrecorded by a

presidential taping system.
Nixon Statement
Seeking to "clear up...once and for
all" the controversy about the
Watergate conversations, Nixon said in
a written statement that he will:
—Voluntarily submit recordings of
two April 16, 1973, conversations
with then-counsel John W. Dean 111,
saying they "covered much of the
same subject matter" as an April 15
meeting with Dean that the White
House said went unrecorded.
—Allow the court to listen to other
unsubpoenaed reels of tapes to
demonstrate that no recordings were
made of the subpoenaed April 15
Dean meeting or of a subpoenaed June
20, 1972, telephone conversation with
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell.
Tape Examination
—Agree that "court-approved
independent experts employing the
most advanced technological
methods" examine all tapes in
question "for any evidence of
alterations...."
—Supply portions of his personal
diary file subpoenaed by prosecutors,
including dictation belts containing his
recollections of the Mitchell telephone

call and handwritten notes of his April
15 meeting with Dean.
Nixon said a search of his personal
diary file a week ago failed to tum up
a dictation belt of his recollections of
the April 15 meeting with Dean. He
said he thought he had dictated his
recollections after that meeting, and
White House spokesmen said as
recently as Nov. 2 that such a
dictation belt existed.
'Diligent Search'
"I have made a diligent search...,"
Nixon said in a statement. "Other than
my contemporaneous note of that
meeting..., I have found no such
evidence."
Dean has testified that in the April
15 meeting the President admitted
discussing executive clemency as part
of the Watergate cover-up and that
Nixon said he had only been joking
earlier when he said it would be no
problem to raise $1 million in hush
money.
Two weeks ago, the White House
disclosed in court that the April 15
meeting was not recorded because an
untended tape recorder ran out of
tape. Disclosure about that meeting
and the Mitchell one prompted Sirica
to begin a hearing on the tape
recordings.
Press Briefing
At a White House news briefing,
Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
that the president used earphones on
June 4 when he spent about 12 hours
listening to a number of tape
recordings. Therefore, Ziegler said, a
recording of the recordings the
President listened to that day "would
not exist." The question had been
raised in court.
