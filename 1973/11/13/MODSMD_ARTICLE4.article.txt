# Chicano Office Move Ires ASSU Senate
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
The ASSU Senate passed a
resolution last night supporting the
Chicano community's effort to keep
the Chicano Executive Committee
(CEC) in its present office.
After a student demonstration
yesterday in front of President
Lyman's office, University officials

said they will reconsider their plan to
relocate CEC from Building One to
Building 80 in the Quad.
"We think it might be the beginning
of the end" of the office, said senator
Rosemary Esparza.
Derek Toliver, senator and
chairman of the Black Students Union
(BSU), pointed to the University's
gradual phasing out of the Office of
the Assistant to the President for
Black Affairs. When the last Assistant
resigned in June, the University did
not replace him and recently
"suggested" that the office be phased
out, Toliver said. After formally
protesting the phase out, the BSU has
not yet received a reply from the
University.
A University official said the plan
to move to the office results from "a
clear priority" being given to academic
space needs.
In other proceedings,
— Senate members conceded that
after their meeting with University
lawyers, the proposed 7.6 percent
tuition hike will pass the Board of
Trustees meeting this week.
— The Senate passed a resolution
urging that if it is financially possible
to maintain a Germany overseas
campus then it should be retained in a
rural setting.
— Vice President Beth Garfield said
there will be an open meeting of the
Cowell Task Force, primarily
concerned with gynecological matters,
Thursday, 9 p.m. in the ATO lounge.
