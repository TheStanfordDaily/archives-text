# Dundes' Professional Spark Enlivens Lectures

### BOB LOWE 
The former vice-president of CBS
radio walks to the edge of the stage.
The toes of his shoes extend
precariously over the metal strip. He
pulls off his black-rimmed
businessman's glasses and starts his
lecture.
Jules Dundes straddles a thin line
between two worlds. With one foot he
stands in the world of 31 years in the
broadcast industry, a career mixed
with the daily business of a corporate
executive and the fast-paced
excitement of mass media.
His other foot is planted in the
academic community. He has been a
Stanford lecturer in broadcast
communication for the past five years
and finds the wide-open environment
of academia a refreshing change.
The opposing elements of Dundes'
life overlap in ways which are
sometimes harmonious, sometimes
antagonistic.
As a teacher, he draws lecture
material from experiences of his
working past. He transforms his
real-life experiences into digestible
modules of learning for his students.
Dundes comes across self-assured
and confident of his position between
worlds. He speaks with a precision and
conviction that indicate he's resolved
any conflict between past and present.
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose

describes him as "a calm and even type
of fellow."
Controversial Stands
As general manager of KCBS in San
Francisco from 1961 to 1967, Dundes'
editorials on controversial issues
brought him a flow of hate mail and
necessitated an unlisted phone
number.
In 1964 he called for the defeat of
Proposition 14, a proposal to legalize
segregated housing in California which
was voted down. In the heated
controversy surrounding the issue
Dundes' editorials put him in an
ambiguous situation, sandwiched
between his sense of social
responsibility and the censure of his
business associates.
Before he came to KCBS, D".ndes
held the post of vice-president of CBS
radio in charge of station management.
He helped to bring radio out of the
status quo music format it followed
during the 1950's and introduced
editorials and talk programs to stations
throughout the country.
He pioneered the broadcast
editorial and paved the way for
commentators like Eric Sevareid and
Harry Reasoner. "There is a
responsibility for a station in a
community to express opinion" on
issues of importance, he explains.
Dundes entered the world of mass
media as a part-time sportswriter for

the New York Post while he was
working towards a degree in business
at Columbia University. At age 19, he
helped cover the 1932 Olympics in
Los Angeles for the Post, interviewing
the legendary track star Jesse Owens
and other athletes.
His career with CBS began in 1936,
when he was hired as an advertising
and promotion copy writer. Dundes
rose through the ranks of CBS
management, beginning as advertising
and sales promotion manager for
WCBS in New York and reaching the
vice-presidency of CBS in 1956.
In 1967 Dundes left radio,
explaining that he had done as much
as he could in the field and wanted
"new challenges, new directions, and
new excitement, all of which were to
be found in teaching."
Dundes frequently brings elements
of his professional broadcasting career
into the classroom. His eyes sparkle
when he tells how he once delivered a
speech, mispronouncing the word
"epitome" as "e-pee-tome" and
continued on without catching the
mistake.
Lecturing Style
Lecturing to his large Broadcast
Communication class, Dundes strolls
slowly back and forth, garbed in dark
slacks, colorful shirt and wide tie. He
spikes his lectures with spontaneous
