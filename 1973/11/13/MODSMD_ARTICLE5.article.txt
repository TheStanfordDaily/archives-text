# Dundes' Professional Spark Enlivens Lectures

Jules Dundes straddles a thin line
between two worlds. With one foot he
stands in the world of 31 years in the
broadcast industry, a career mixed
with the daily business of a corporate
executive and the fast-paced
excitement of mass media.
His other foot is planted in the
academic community. He has been a
Stanford lecturer in broadcast
communication for the past five years
and finds the wide-open environment
of academia a refreshing change.
The opposing elements of Dundes'
life overlap in ways which are
sometimes harmonious, sometimes
antagonistic.
As a teacher, he draws lecture
material from experiences of his
working past. He transforms his
real-life experiences into digestible
modules of learning for his students.
Dundes comes across self-assured
and confident of his position between
worlds. He speaks with a precision and
conviction that indicate he's resolved
any conflict between past and present.
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose

describes him as "a calm and even type
of fellow."
Controversial Stands
As general manager of KCBS in San
Francisco from 1961 to 1967, Dundes'
editorials on controversial issues
brought him a flow of hate mail and
necessitated an unlisted phone
number.
In 1964 he called for the defeat of
Proposition 14, a proposal to legalize
segregated housing in California which
was voted down. In the heated
controversy surrounding the issue
Dundes' editorials put him in an
ambiguous situation, sandwiched
between his sense of social
responsibility and the censure of his
business associates.
Before he came to KCBS, D".ndes
held the post of vice-president of CBS
radio in charge of station management.
He helped to bring radio out of the
status quo music format it followed
during the 1950's and introduced
editorials and talk programs to stations
throughout the country.
He pioneered the broadcast
editorial and paved the way for
commentators like Eric Sevareid and
Harry Reasoner. "There is a
responsibility for a station in a
community to express opinion" on
issues of importance, he explains.
Dundes entered the world of mass
media as a part-time sportswriter for

the New York Post while he was
working towards a degree in business
at Columbia University. At age 19, he
helped cover the 1932 Olympics in
Los Angeles for the Post, interviewing
the legendary track star Jesse Owens
and other athletes.
His career with CBS began in 1936,
when he was hired as an advertising
and promotion copy writer. Dundes
rose through the ranks of CBS
management, beginning as advertising
and sales promotion manager for
WCBS in New York and reaching the
vice-presidency of CBS in 1956.
In 1967 Dundes left radio,
explaining that he had done as much
as he could in the field and wanted
"new challenges, new directions, and
new excitement, all of which were to
be found in teaching."
Dundes frequently brings elements
of his professional broadcasting career
into the classroom. His eyes sparkle
when he tells how he once delivered a
speech, mispronouncing the word
"epitome" as "e-pee-tome" and
continued on without catching the
mistake.
Lecturing Style
Lecturing to his large Broadcast
Communication class, Dundes strolls
slowly back and forth, garbed in dark
slacks, colorful shirt and wide tie. He
spikes his lectures with spontaneous

two careers.
anecdotes from his past. Occasionally,
he digresses into areas which, he says,
"I lead myself into."
Students in his class react in
different ways to this lecture style.
One student said that Dundes is an
"excellent teacher, mainly because
he's so experienced and knows the
field. But," she added, "his digressions
tend to distract in large lectures and
sometimes lose the class." Other
students find his "personal touch" the
best aspect of the course.
But there is no question that
Dundes knows a great deal about
broadcasting. As one student put it,"I
like him because he knows so much,
but he doesn't pretend to know
everything."
Since Dundes left the broadcasting
industry, he has begun to challenge
parts of its fundamental business
philosophy. Because his present

situation gives him a "broader
perspective," he now advocates
changes which would shake the very
foundations of broadcasting.
Media Profit-Hungry
He accuses television and radio of
being too profit-hungry and neglecting
their responsibilities to the public. He
proposes that commercialism on the
air be cut back and that public interest
programming be increased.
Dundes calls the theory that
broadcasters will lose viewers and
money if they increase public interest
programming a "fallacious truism of
the industry." He cites the widely
viewed Watergate coverage and Middle
East specials as examples contradicting
this theory.
The change from broadcaster to
teacher entailed a large change in
Dundes' life style. Although
broadcasting was exciting and

stimulating, it was also "hectic and
frenetic." He welcomed the change to
a slower pace of life which allows him
time to "read, to study, and to
reflect..
Dundes and his wife for the last 36
years, Frances, live in San Francisco
near Golden Gate Park. They prefer
living in the city despite separating
Dundes from his teaching
responsibilities at Stanford because,
according to Mrs. Dundes, "San
Francisco has vitality, variety and no
self-consciousness." They make use of
the city, frequenting its museums,
theaters and symphony and chamber
music concerts.
Outside Interests
Although his life now is relatively
slow-paced, Dundes is far from
inactive. He maintains his interests in
civil rights, serving on the Advisory
Board of the San Francisco Human

Rights Commission and is a member of
the American Civil Liberties Union. He
also finds time and energy to hold the
position of first vice-president of
United Cerebral Palsy in San
Francisco.
The Dundes have two daughters,
both married. The elder daughter
teaches sociology at the University of
Pittsburgh and the younger one works
in a people's theater in England. The
Dundes also have two grandchildren.
In recent years, Dundes has traveled
extensively. Last summer he and his
wife visited the Soviet Union.
Although he noted that the language
barrier was frustrating, Dundes
enjoyed the experience.
His next objective is a trip to China,
which Dundes hopes to visit when
tourist restrictions are lowered. Until
then, he's content to go wherever he
can, so long as it "represents seeing a
bit more of the world."

he digresses into areas which, he says,
"I lead myself into."
Students in his class react in
different ways to this lecture style.
One student said that Dundes is an
"excellent teacher, mainly because
he's so experienced and knows the
field. But," she added, "his digressions
tend to distract in large lectures and
sometimes lose the class." Other
students find his "personal touch" the
best aspect of the course.
But there is no question that
Dundes knows a great deal about
broadcasting. As one student put it,"I
like him because he knows so much,
but he doesn't pretend to know
everything."
Since Dundes left the broadcasting
industry, he has begun to challenge
parts of its fundamental business
philosophy. Because his present

situation gives him a "broader
perspective," he now advocates
changes which would shake the very
foundations of broadcasting.
Media Profit-Hungry
He accuses television and radio of
being too profit-hungry and neglecting
their responsibilities to the public. He
proposes that commercialism on the
air be cut back and that public interest
programming be increased.
Dundes calls the theory that
broadcasters will lose viewers and
money if they increase public interest
programming a "fallacious truism of
the industry." He cites the widely
viewed Watergate coverage and Middle
East specials as examples contradicting
this theory.
The change from broadcaster to
teacher entailed a large change in
Dundes' life style. Although
broadcasting was exciting and

stimulating, it was also "hectic and
frenetic." He welcomed the change to
a slower pace of life which allows him
time to "read, to study, and to
reflect..
Dundes and his wife for the last 36
years, Frances, live in San Francisco
near Golden Gate Park. They prefer
living in the city despite separating
Dundes from his teaching
responsibilities at Stanford because,
according to Mrs. Dundes, "San
Francisco has vitality, variety and no
self-consciousness." They make use of
the city, frequenting its museums,
theaters and symphony and chamber
music concerts.
Outside Interests
Although his life now is relatively
slow-paced, Dundes is far from
inactive. He maintains his interests in
civil rights, serving on the Advisory
Board of the San Francisco Human

Rights Commission and is a member of
the American Civil Liberties Union. He
also finds time and energy to hold the
position of first vice-president of
United Cerebral Palsy in San
Francisco.
The Dundes have two daughters,
both married. The elder daughter
teaches sociology at the University of
Pittsburgh and the younger one works
in a people's theater in England. The
Dundes also have two grandchildren.
In recent years, Dundes has traveled
extensively. Last summer he and his
wife visited the Soviet Union.
Although he noted that the language
barrier was frustrating, Dundes
enjoyed the experience.
His next objective is a trip to China,
which Dundes hopes to visit when
tourist restrictions are lowered. Until
then, he's content to go wherever he
can, so long as it "represents seeing a
bit more of the world."
The former vice-president of CBS
radio walks to the edge of the stage.
The toes of his shoes extend
precariously over the metal strip. He

Jules Dundes straddles a thin line
between two worlds. With one foot he
stands in the world of 31 years in the
broadcast industry, a career mixed
with the daily business of a corporate
executive and the fast-paced
excitement of mass media.
His other foot is planted in the
academic community. He has been a
Stanford lecturer in broadcast
communication for the past five years
and finds the wide-open environment
of academia a refreshing change.
The opposing elements of Dundes'
life overlap in ways which are
sometimes harmonious, sometimes
antagonistic.
As a teacher, he draws lecture
material from experiences of his
working past. He transforms his
real-life experiences into digestible
modules of learning for his students.
Dundes comes across self-assured
and confident of his position between
worlds. He speaks with a precision and
conviction that indicate he's resolved
any conflict between past and present.
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose

describes him as "a calm and even type
of fellow."
Controversial Stands
As general manager of KCBS in San
Francisco from 1961 to 1967, Dundes'
editorials on controversial issues
brought him a flow of hate mail and
necessitated an unlisted phone
number.
In 1964 he called for the defeat of
Proposition 14, a proposal to legalize
segregated housing in California which
was voted down. In the heated
controversy surrounding the issue
Dundes' editorials put him in an
ambiguous situation, sandwiched
between his sense of social
responsibility and the censure of his
business associates.
Before he came to KCBS, D".ndes
held the post of vice-president of CBS
radio in charge of station management.
He helped to bring radio out of the
status quo music format it followed
during the 1950's and introduced
editorials and talk programs to stations
throughout the country.
He pioneered the broadcast
editorial and paved the way for
commentators like Eric Sevareid and
Harry Reasoner. "There is a
responsibility for a station in a
community to express opinion" on
issues of importance, he explains.
Dundes entered the world of mass
media as a part-time sportswriter for

the New York Post while he was
working towards a degree in business
at Columbia University. At age 19, he
helped cover the 1932 Olympics in
Los Angeles for the Post, interviewing
the legendary track star Jesse Owens
and other athletes.
His career with CBS began in 1936,
when he was hired as an advertising
and promotion copy writer. Dundes
rose through the ranks of CBS
management, beginning as advertising
and sales promotion manager for
WCBS in New York and reaching the
vice-presidency of CBS in 1956.
In 1967 Dundes left radio,
explaining that he had done as much
as he could in the field and wanted
"new challenges, new directions, and
new excitement, all of which were to
be found in teaching."
Dundes frequently brings elements
of his professional broadcasting career
into the classroom. His eyes sparkle
when he tells how he once delivered a
speech, mispronouncing the word
"epitome" as "e-pee-tome" and
continued on without catching the
mistake.

working past. He transforms his
real-life experiences into digestible

Dundes comes across self-assured
and confident of his position between
worlds. He speaks with a precision and
conviction that indicate he's resolved
any conflict between past and present.
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose

describes him as "a calm and even type
of fellow."
Controversial Stands
As general manager of KCBS in San
Francisco from 1961 to 1967, Dundes'
editorials on controversial issues
brought him a flow of hate mail and
necessitated an unlisted phone
number.
In 1964 he called for the defeat of
Proposition 14, a proposal to legalize
segregated housing in California which
was voted down. In the heated
controversy surrounding the issue
Dundes' editorials put him in an
ambiguous situation, sandwiched
between his sense of social
responsibility and the censure of his
business associates.
Before he came to KCBS, D".ndes
held the post of vice-president of CBS
radio in charge of station management.
He helped to bring radio out of the
status quo music format it followed
during the 1950's and introduced
editorials and talk programs to stations
throughout the country.
He pioneered the broadcast
editorial and paved the way for
commentators like Eric Sevareid and
Harry Reasoner. "There is a
responsibility for a station in a
community to express opinion" on
issues of importance, he explains.
Dundes entered the world of mass
media as a part-time sportswriter for

the New York Post while he was
working towards a degree in business
at Columbia University. At age 19, he
helped cover the 1932 Olympics in
Los Angeles for the Post, interviewing
the legendary track star Jesse Owens
and other athletes.
His career with CBS began in 1936,
when he was hired as an advertising
and promotion copy writer. Dundes
rose through the ranks of CBS
management, beginning as advertising
and sales promotion manager for
WCBS in New York and reaching the
vice-presidency of CBS in 1956.
In 1967 Dundes left radio,
explaining that he had done as much
as he could in the field and wanted
"new challenges, new directions, and
new excitement, all of which were to
be found in teaching."
Dundes frequently brings elements
of his professional broadcasting career
into the classroom. His eyes sparkle
when he tells how he once delivered a
speech, mispronouncing the word
"epitome" as "e-pee-tome" and
continued on without catching the
mistake.
Lecturing Style

two careers.
anecdotes from his past. Occasionally,
he digresses into areas which, he says,
"I lead myself into."
Students in his class react in
different ways to this lecture style.
One student said that Dundes is an
"excellent teacher, mainly because
he's so experienced and knows the
field. But," she added, "his digressions
tend to distract in large lectures and
sometimes lose the class." Other
students find his "personal touch" the
best aspect of the course.
But there is no question that
Dundes knows a great deal about
broadcasting. As one student put it,"I
like him because he knows so much,
but he doesn't pretend to know
everything."
Since Dundes left the broadcasting
industry, he has begun to challenge
parts of its fundamental business
philosophy. Because his present

situation gives him a "broader
perspective," he now advocates
changes which would shake the very
foundations of broadcasting.
Media Profit-Hungry
He accuses television and radio of
being too profit-hungry and neglecting
their responsibilities to the public. He
proposes that commercialism on the
air be cut back and that public interest
programming be increased.
Dundes calls the theory that
broadcasters will lose viewers and
money if they increase public interest
programming a "fallacious truism of
the industry." He cites the widely
viewed Watergate coverage and Middle
East specials as examples contradicting
this theory.
The change from broadcaster to
teacher entailed a large change in
Dundes' life style. Although
broadcasting was exciting and

stimulating, it was also "hectic and
frenetic." He welcomed the change to
a slower pace of life which allows him
time to "read, to study, and to
reflect..
Dundes and his wife for the last 36
years, Frances, live in San Francisco
near Golden Gate Park. They prefer
living in the city despite separating
Dundes from his teaching
responsibilities at Stanford because,
according to Mrs. Dundes, "San
Francisco has vitality, variety and no
self-consciousness." They make use of
the city, frequenting its museums,
theaters and symphony and chamber
music concerts.
Outside Interests
Although his life now is relatively
slow-paced, Dundes is far from
inactive. He maintains his interests in
civil rights, serving on the Advisory
Board of the San Francisco Human

Rights Commission and is a member of
the American Civil Liberties Union. He
also finds time and energy to hold the
position of first vice-president of
United Cerebral Palsy in San
Francisco.
The Dundes have two daughters,
both married. The elder daughter
teaches sociology at the University of
Pittsburgh and the younger one works
in a people's theater in England. The
Dundes also have two grandchildren.
In recent years, Dundes has traveled
extensively. Last summer he and his
wife visited the Soviet Union.
Although he noted that the language
barrier was frustrating, Dundes
enjoyed the experience.
His next objective is a trip to China,
which Dundes hopes to visit when
tourist restrictions are lowered. Until
then, he's content to go wherever he
can, so long as it "represents seeing a
bit more of the world."
The former vice-president of CBS
radio walks to the edge of the stage.
The toes of his shoes extend
precariously over the metal strip. He
pulls off his black-rimmed
businessman's glasses and starts his
lecture.
Jules Dundes straddles a thin line
between two worlds. With one foot he
stands in the world of 31 years in the
broadcast industry, a career mixed
with the daily business of a corporate
executive and the fast-paced
excitement of mass media.
His other foot is planted in the
academic community. He has been a
Stanford lecturer in broadcast
communication for the past five years
and finds the wide-open environment
of academia a refreshing change.
The opposing elements of Dundes'
life overlap in ways which are
sometimes harmonious, sometimes
antagonistic.

Media Profit-Hungry
He accuses television and radio of
being too profit-hungry and neglecting
their responsibilities to the public. He
proposes that commercialism on the
air be cut back and that public interest
programming be increased.
Dundes calls the theory that
broadcasters will lose viewers and
money if they increase public interest
programming a "fallacious truism of
the industry." He cites the widely
viewed Watergate coverage and Middle
East specials as examples contradicting
this theory.
The change from broadcaster to
teacher entailed a large change in
Dundes' life style. Although
broadcasting was exciting and

stimulating, it was also "hectic and
frenetic." He welcomed the change to
a slower pace of life which allows him
time to "read, to study, and to
reflect..
Dundes and his wife for the last 36
years, Frances, live in San Francisco
near Golden Gate Park. They prefer
living in the city despite separating
Dundes from his teaching
responsibilities at Stanford because,
according to Mrs. Dundes, "San
Francisco has vitality, variety and no
self-consciousness." They make use of
the city, frequenting its museums,
theaters and symphony and chamber
music concerts.
Outside Interests
Although his life now is relatively
slow-paced, Dundes is far from
inactive. He maintains his interests in
civil rights, serving on the Advisory
Board of the San Francisco Human

Rights Commission and is a member of
the American Civil Liberties Union. He
also finds time and energy to hold the
position of first vice-president of
United Cerebral Palsy in San
Francisco.
The Dundes have two daughters,
both married. The elder daughter
teaches sociology at the University of
Pittsburgh and the younger one works
in a people's theater in England. The
Dundes also have two grandchildren.
In recent years, Dundes has traveled
extensively. Last summer he and his
wife visited the Soviet Union.
Although he noted that the language
barrier was frustrating, Dundes
enjoyed the experience.
His next objective is a trip to China,
which Dundes hopes to visit when
tourist restrictions are lowered. Until
then, he's content to go wherever he
can, so long as it "represents seeing a
bit more of the world."
