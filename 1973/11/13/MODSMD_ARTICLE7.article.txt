# Potential Unifying Force
## Ford Embodies Conciliatory Powers 
### 
Larry Diamond

The bizarre march of events on
the national political stage is
forcing upon us a new question
which is likely to be the subject of
increasingly serious discussion in
the next few weeks — what would
Gerald Ford be like as President?
Political observers of every
ideology can be expected to
debate this question in
conjunction with the larger one of
whether Richard Nixon should be
impeached and removed from
office.
Many liberals will complain
that Ford lacks the talent to be an
effective President; some have
already suggested that his
conservative politics and close ties
to Nixon should disqualify him
from confirmation as the
potential successor to the
President.
But the liberal community
would do well to pause in
judgement before it dismisses
Gerald Ford as unacceptable.
Ford is a man of very
conservative politics, to be sure,
and the best that has been said
about his political style is that he
is dependable and honest, if
unimaginative. But there is reason
to believe that Ford's succession
to the Presidency could have some
healing effect on a national
political system that has been
fractured at its roots by the
confrontations and crises of
credibility and Orwellian
d o u b 1 e-talk of the
Watergate-stricken White House.
Honest And Uncorrupted
It appears so far that Ford is an
honest and uncorrupted man, and
if the 1700 pages of FBI collected
data do indeed bear this out, this
in itself will be a powerful asset
for Ford. Even if they disagree
with his politics, Americans want
at least to be able to respect the
credibility and integrity of their
President.
It has been so long since we
had a President whose credibility
was generally unchallenged, it is
hard for us to remember what it
used to be like. But this
elementary credibility is an
important foundation of the
Presidency as an institution, and if
Gerald Ford does little more than
restore a pattern of honesty and
openness to the execution of
Presidential responsibilities, he
will have done something
significant for the nation.
How Ford would deal with the

Watergate investigation would be
a crucial determinant of his
credibility. The signs he has given
so far on this are encouraging.
Not A Puppet
Last week he testified in
Senate hearings that the House
impeachment investigation should
proceed; that he could understand
why Richardson resigned when
Cox was fired and that he would
have felt the same way in
Richardson's place; that the FBl's
moving in to surround the Special
Prosecutor's office after the
firings shocked his sensibilities;
that the President should have
given up the tapes, and disclosed
that two of them were missing,
much sooner; and that the public
wouldn't stand for it if a President
resigned and his successor tried to
quash any criminal investigation
against him.
These are not the statements of
a Nixon puppet. Rather, they
indicate that Ford has the
independence (or call it
shrewdness if you wish) to
disassociate himself from Nixon
when it becomes politically
necessary to do so, and that he
has the judgement and sense to
recognize political necessity.
Such political sense and
judgement can spare a nation the
kind of continued constitutional
confrontation that has so badly
crippled and divided our system
under Nixon.
Unification Tendencies
It seems also that Ford
understands the necessity of
healing these deep divisions. The
view of his coming role that he
has underscored most
emphatically is that of a "ready
conciliator and calm
communicator between the White
House and Capitol Hill."
Republicans of all political
factions indicate that it is in the
role of conciliator and unifier that
Ford has been at his political best.
In a Ford administration, we
could expect a serious
rapprochement between the
President and the Congress, and
an end to this ugly warfare
between the President and the
national press. Certainly Ford
could not end all division in a
political process that depends for
its vitality on a contest of ideas,
but he could restore a sense of
order and due process to that
contest.
It is in this sense that Gerald

Ford may make his greatest
contribution as President.
Promising Leader
Ford is a conservative
politician — his voting record is
anti-labor, mixed at best on civil
rights, and staunch in its defense
of a terribly bloated military
budget. There will be not bold
new programs to redress social
and economic injustices sponsored
by a Ford Administration, and it
is important that we have no
illusions about this.
But as President, Ford could
provide a political climate in
which the great social issues that
face America — the tax structure,
poverty, health care, urban
renewal, education — could again
become the focus of national
debate.
Lasting progress is unlikely to
be made on these issues so long as
all the resources of public
discussion remain focused on
whether or not the President is a
criminal, and so long as the
various arms of government are in
disarray and at war with each
other.
Many view a Presidential
resignation or impeachment as
having inevitably cataclysmic
implications. But it can instead be
an affirmation of the strength and
vitality of the American political
process if it is followed by an
administration able to restore the
confidence of the people, the
balance of constitutional powers,

and the due process of law which
is a precondition of effective
government.
We now dangerously approach
the brink of a complete
governmental paralysis caused by
a total loss of its credibility on
anything it says or does. There are
strong indications that Gerald
Ford has the conciliatory instincts
and ability to take the nation
back from this brink. Should he
succeed to the Presidency, the
liberal community must give him
a chance to try.
