# Medical School Revision
## Admissions Policy Opposed 
### 
101 Medical Students

(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion of
a two-part series.)
The first part of this article described events
leading up to an agreement on Oct. 11 by Clayton
Rich, Dean of the Medical School, to delay a
decision he had apparently made under direction
from President Lyman, to strip students and other
non-faculty members of the Admissions Committees
of their votes and to press for merger of the
Minority Admissions Committee (MAC) with the
"Regular" Admissions Committee (RAC).
This would be done in the face of strong
opposition from the minority community, the
students, and against the recommendations of the
Medical School Faculty Senate Committee on
Admission Policy.
Following the agreement, student representatives
began meeting daily with administrators. The
rationale for revoking the voting rights of students
and community physicians advanced by Rich was
that, in the opinion of Lyman's lawyers, having
non-faculty voting members on admissions
committees made the University vulnerable to suit.
However, when the administration learned that
students were consulting their own lawyer, Rich
backed down. As the legal argument disappeared
voting status of non-faculty members was no longer
at issue. With non-faculty voting status assured, the
survival of the MAC was guaranteed.
Student Influence Weakened
Giving up the voting issue, the administration
seized upon a plan that would effectively dilute the
influence of student members of the committee:
backing up all student interviews with a faculty
interview. This double interview plan quickly
became the subject for the previously agreed to
public meeting, and Dean Rich assured us that no
decision would be made until after the meeting.
As the day of the public meeting neared, it
became apparent that Dean Rich had no intention of
producing the written statement he had promised.
During the meeting, we learned that he had violated
another point of his agreement when members of
the Admissions Committee revealed that two days
before, in a meeting with Dean Rich and without
student members, they had already voted to adopt
the Dean's double interview plan. This action,
perhaps more than any other, demonstrated to us
the total disregard for student opinion.
The arguments in favor of this plan were so lame
in the face of the near-unanimous positive
evaluation of student performance last year that it
became clear that Rich's arguments were based on

political considerations and not, as he claimed, on
"academic considerations."
Constitutional Provision
During the days preceding the public meeting,
the students decided to hold an election to
nominate the student members of the RAC.
Although student members of this committee have
never been chosen by students before, the Stanford
Medical Student Association constitution provides
the student members to all Medical School
Committees shall be chosen by students, and on all
other committees, including the MAC, the
procedure is followed.
Twelve students ran for three positions, although
the administration never officially agreed to accept
the results of the election, we were told by Dr.
Steward, RAC chairman, that he expected the three
students elected would be confirmed but that the
committee wanted to interview the students.
Steward never adequately explained the students'
position to his committee and he refused to allow a
student to attend a RAC meeting to present oral
argument. Rather, two members of the RAC who
were opposed to the student position were named
to a subcommittee which interviewed all twelve
candidates and selected the second, sixth, and
twelfth place finishers, seemingly in delibeiate
defiance of the student election.
The results of the RAC meeting of last Tuesday
tell why the administration refused to let students
speak before the Committee. After hearing from its
new student members, the Committee first narrowly
missed endorsing an election to select student
members for the current year. Following that, the
Committee voted 10-2 to oppose the double
interviewing plan. The decision now seems to be in
the hands of the Dean. In the face of the total lack
of compelling evidence to the contrary, Dean Rich
now has no valid reason for denying student's rights
to choose student committee members or for
abandoning the double interview plan.
The events of the last month have left us
frustrated and bitter. At the present, we are fighting
to retain what had already been achieved, but the
ultimate goal of our struggle is a change in the
centralized structure of power in the Medical School
and the recognition and respect of the faculty and
administration for student influence and opinion.
Until that is achieved, we will be subject to the
convenience of the Dean's office and be effectively
excluded from the determination of our own
educational futures.

interview. This double interview plan quickly
became the subject for the previously agreed to
public meeting, and Dean Rich assured us that no
decision would be made until after the meeting.
As the day of the public meeting neared, it
became apparent that Dean Rich had no intention of
producing the written statement he had promised.
During the meeting, we learned that he had violated
another point of his agreement when members of
the Admissions Committee revealed that two days
before, in a meeting with Dean Rich and without
student members, they had already voted to adopt
the Dean's double interview plan. This action,
perhaps more than any other, demonstrated to us
the total disregard for student opinion.
The arguments in favor of this plan were so lame
in the face of the near-unanimous positive
evaluation of student performance last year that it
became clear that Rich's arguments were based on

political considerations and not, as he claimed, on
"academic considerations."
Constitutional Provision
During the days preceding the public meeting,
the students decided to hold an election to
nominate the student members of the RAC.
Although student members of this committee have
never been chosen by students before, the Stanford
Medical Student Association constitution provides
the student members to all Medical School
Committees shall be chosen by students, and on all
other committees, including the MAC, the
procedure is followed.
Twelve students ran for three positions, although
the administration never officially agreed to accept
the results of the election, we were told by Dr.
Steward, RAC chairman, that he expected the three
students elected would be confirmed but that the
committee wanted to interview the students.
Steward never adequately explained the students'
position to his committee and he refused to allow a
student to attend a RAC meeting to present oral
argument. Rather, two members of the RAC who
were opposed to the student position were named
to a subcommittee which interviewed all twelve
candidates and selected the second, sixth, and
twelfth place finishers, seemingly in delibeiate
defiance of the student election.
The results of the RAC meeting of last Tuesday
tell why the administration refused to let students
speak before the Committee. After hearing from its
new student members, the Committee first narrowly
missed endorsing an election to select student
members for the current year. Following that, the
Committee voted 10-2 to oppose the double
interviewing plan. The decision now seems to be in
the hands of the Dean. In the face of the total lack
of compelling evidence to the contrary, Dean Rich
now has no valid reason for denying student's rights
to choose student committee members or for
abandoning the double interview plan.
The events of the last month have left us
frustrated and bitter. At the present, we are fighting
to retain what had already been achieved, but the
ultimate goal of our struggle is a change in the
centralized structure of power in the Medical School
and the recognition and respect of the faculty and
administration for student influence and opinion.
Until that is achieved, we will be subject to the
convenience of the Dean's office and be effectively
excluded from the determination of our own
educational futures.

(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion of
a two-part series.)
The first part of this article described events
leading up to an agreement on Oct. 11 by Clayton
Rich, Dean of the Medical School, to delay a
decision he had apparently made under direction
from President Lyman, to strip students and other
non-faculty members of the Admissions Committees
of their votes and to press for merger of the
Minority Admissions Committee (MAC) with the
"Regular" Admissions Committee (RAC).
This would be done in the face of strong
opposition from the minority community, the
students, and against the recommendations of the
Medical School Faculty Senate Committee on
Admission Policy.
Following the agreement, student representatives
began meeting daily with administrators. The
rationale for revoking the voting rights of students
and community physicians advanced by Rich was
that, in the opinion of Lyman's lawyers, having
non-faculty voting members on admissions
committees made the University vulnerable to suit.
However, when the administration learned that
students were consulting their own lawyer, Rich
backed down. As the legal argument disappeared
voting status of non-faculty members was no longer
at issue. With non-faculty voting status assured, the
survival of the MAC was guaranteed.
Student Influence Weakened
Giving up the voting issue, the administration
seized upon a plan that would effectively dilute the
influence of student members of the committee:
backing up all student interviews with a faculty
interview. This double interview plan quickly
became the subject for the previously agreed to
public meeting, and Dean Rich assured us that no
