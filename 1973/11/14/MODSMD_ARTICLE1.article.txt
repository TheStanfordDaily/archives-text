# Lyman Raps Chicano 'Incendiary Rumors’
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
President Richard W. Lyman
yesterday criticized chicano leaders
for misrepresenting a University
proposal to move the chicano affairs
office from Building One.
Ralliers who gathered outside
Lyman's office Monday to protest the
proposed move were "operating under
a set of mistaken assumptions and
incendiary rumors," he said on
Campus Conference, a KZSU interview
program.
The President also maintained the
Administration had never planned to
move the Office of Chicano Affairs
from the Inner Quad to a trailer, as
one speaker in yesterday's rally
implied.
He discounted rumors that the
Administration planned immediately
to abolish the position of assistant to
the president for chicano affairs.
According to Lyman, the
Administration has informed chicano
leaders that it is forming a search
committee to replace the void left by
former assistant Salvador Sanchez,
who is now special assistant to the
president.
The Administration has asked
chicano leaders to nominate people to
serve on the committee, Lyman said.
The President added that even
before the resignation of former
Assistant to the President for Chicano
Affairs Luis Nogales, "it had been
clear" the Administration would move
the office to Building 80.
Lyman emphasized that the
proposal does not reflect, as some
protesters implied, a decrease in the
university's committment to minority
affairs.
Budget cuts have not seriously
affected minority programs, and the
Administration has increased minority
program funding in proportion to
increases in the number of minority
students, faculty and staff, Lyman
said.
The President criticized the ASSU
for passing without sufficient evidence
a resolution supporting chicano efforts
to keep the Office of Chicano Affairs
in Building One.
In two to three years the
Administration will phase out the
position of assistant to the president
for chicano affairs, according to
Lyman, because as the number of

chicano professors increases it "won't
make sense to have one person trying
to cover all minority affairs when
there will be minority members in
each of the specialized offices to deal
with those affairs."
Lyman stated that the university
will consider explaining "more fully"
criteria underlying future tuition
increase decisions. Although the Board
of Trustees in the past has favored
keeping ''important
recommendations" secret, Lyman
maintained that making a
recommendation public "does not
commit the Board of Trustees to
approving it."
