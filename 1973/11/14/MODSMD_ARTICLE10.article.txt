Distorted Social Science
Editor:
Two recent letters to the Daily
have criticized the description of
Shockley's proposals as genocide.
Whether the term genocide
accurately characterizes
Shockley's "voluntary"
sterilization bonus program
depends, of course, on what one
means by the word.
Mr. Wilks (Daily, Nov. 9), for

instance, feels that a sterilization
program tied to income level does
not constitute genocide because
the poor are not a race; i.e.,
genocide is the extermination of a
racial group. The problem here is
that human races — Blacks,
Whites, Jews, Arabs, or whatever
— exist as socially, not
biologically, defined groups.
Within the human species, race
is not a workable genetic concept,
which is exactly why Shockley is

obliged to present income level
rather than chromosomes as the
criterion for sterilization in his
proposed program for the
amelioration of Black intelligence.
Racial classifications (and sexual
stereotypes for that matter) are
cultural schemes which organize
the perception of biological
differences in socially sigtiificant
ways. Genocide therefore refers to
the extermination of social
groups, including races or
segments of classes — such as
those who pay no income tax.
I have no particularly deep
attachment to the word genocide,
so if Mr. Wilks has a stronger term
to apply to Shockley's bonus
program, then he should certainly
suggest it. Meanwhile I find using
the word "genocide"as helpful and
demystifying, because it points
attention to the fact that
Shockley's solutions to problems
of social disorder are not
"natural" or biological — some
sort of value-free tinkering with
evolutionary mechanisms, but
political — the extermination of
oppressed social groups.
Shockley's rather messianic
attempt to reduce all social
problems to a biological
foundation is not merely bad
genetics, but horribly distorted
and incompetent social science. (J
can only hope that when Mr.
Wilks claims that Shockley never
talks nonsense it is because he has
never read any of Shockley's
work). Mr. Wilks is himself, I
think, a behavioral scientist. If, as
he says, he hopes and believes that
Shockley's claims are false, then
he should join with other
Stanford social scientists to
disprove and discredit Shockley's
arguments.
If academia is indeed the
domain of free speech — if we are
allowed to speak out but have
not, then our silence on Shockley
must be significant. If the
Stanford community is not
implicitly racist, if our academic
"common-sense" does not
consciously or unconsciously
support the interests of the ruling

class, then why have so few
worked to refute Shockley's
views?

Task Force Praised
Editor:
Two weeks ago a student "task
force" released a SWOPSl
sponsored reported entitled The
Other Stanford. Its publication
was announced in a press
conference and was covered in
lengthy articles in the Daily, in
Campus Report, and elsewhere.
The report was co-authored by
Brent Appel, Vance Peterson, and
Jay Schoenau. In addition, ten
other students participated in
conducting this study of various
aspects of student-faculty
interactions (or lack of them) at
Stanford.
The intent of the authors was
to identify certain problems
facing Stanford and to provoke
serious open discussions between
students, faculty, and
administrators about these
problems. Few such discussions
have yet occurred, but I hope
more will.
The research itself is quite well
done, although not without flaws.
Many of the bases for the
conclusions and recommendations
are open to question.
Nevertheless, I find the report
useful, timely and informative,
and I urge Stanford students and
faculty to read it.
