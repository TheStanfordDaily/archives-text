# Continue Transplant Operations
## Define Death Neurologically 
### 
Jeffrey Wood

I would like to comment and
perhaps provoke some thought on
the antiquated definition of death
that this state has in its legal code.
The idea of death and its
ramifications is complex to say
the least, and in this essay I do
not propose to enter into a
theological discussion as to its
nature. I would like to make the
following definition of death for
the sake of argument: death is the
achievement of a state wherein
the body is incapable of sustaining
itself without continued
supportive measures from an
external source.
If one accepts this definition,
then one must realize that there is
a practical side to the issue. That
is to say that the death of an
individual under some sets of
circumstances can be beneficial to
the lives of others. The intentional
killing of any individual is of
course ruled out.
Medical science has advanced
itself to a stage where the
homotransplantation of organs
and tissue is a reasonable
proposition as clinical treatment
for certain medical disorders. Yet
there are some aspects of this sort
of treatment which require the
donation of tissue which is vital to
the donating individual. For
example, the human body has but
one heart, liver and pancreas. All
of these organs are transplantable,
yet to deprive a healthy individual
of any of them would, to say the
least, cause undue strain. Thus a
reasonable method of obtaining
grafts of this sort would be from
fresh cadavers.
There are several points to be
made about the condition of
homografts, if they are to be
acceptable for transplantation.
The tissue match is primary
amongst these, but this is a
complicated, and as yet
unresolved, biochemical question
which I will not delve into. The
graft must be in as near to normal
condition as is possible. That is,

the functioning of the circulation,
respiration and excretion must be
maintained at normal levels. In
this way the body will not be
allowed to begin the process of
disintegration which is one of the
results of death.
Special Classification
There is a special class of
deaths where the above
circumstances may be found.
These are the head injuries; where
an individual has sustained trauma
to the brain resulting in its
cessation of function. If this
condition has existed for more
than four minutes the result is
neurological death. In this
condition the patient may be kept
"alive" with heart beating and
lungs functioning; i.e., the old
definition says he is alive. But
after a span of time the bodily
deterioration will be initiated. The
lungs will have to be assisted by a
respirator, the kidney function
taken over by dialysis units and
the heart resuscitated several
times during the course of care.
There are three results which
come from this treatment. The
first and most likely is death; after
a period of time the body will be
so deteriorated that it will not
respond to treatment. The second
is that the metabolic function will

return to a near normal state, and
the body will be able to sustain
itself with a varied amount of
assistance. The brain however will
be non-functional; meaning that
the "being" will be a
self-perpetuating mass of
protoplasm which will serve no
function but to drain the
resources of family or state so
that it may be kept "alive." The
cost of this type of care is
phenomenal, one day in the ICU
at Stanford has a base charge of
$160, with all other services
added on, the daily cost gets quite
high.
The third possibility is a
complete recovery. In my eight
years of working in hospitals I
have not heard of such an
occurance, and physicians I have
spoken with bear out the point.
The useless condition of
"heart-lung death" organs should
become apparent and also the
definition which necessitates their
use.
I therefore suggest that a more
modern and realistic definition of
death based on neurological
demise be adopted so that
progress in transplantation as a
clinical tool may continue.
