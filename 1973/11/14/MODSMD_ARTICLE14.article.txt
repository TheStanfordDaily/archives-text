# Pre Thrives On Crowds
## 
### MARK WHITE 
When Stanford's Tony Sandoval won the
individual title at the Southern Division Pac-8
cross country championships here three weeks
ago, Sandoval quietly exited from the scene and
was unobtrusively relaxing after the race. When
individual awards were announced, Tony had to
be prodded to emerge from the background
where he had quietly been talking to a few
friends.
Two weeks later Steve Prefontaine won the
Pac-8 cross country final championship on the
same course. But there was no quiet exit; indeed
a rather excited crowd of cross country/long
distance buffs descended upon the Olympian and
demanded autographs, poses for photographs and
tactical advice for upcoming amateur marathons
from the obviously spent Prefontaine.
Whereas Sandoval was content to withdraw
from the attentions of the crowd, Prefontaine
seemed to derive a gritty satisfaction from the
surging admirers. Some athletes shirk from the
demands of the crowd, but others, like
Prefontaine, enjoy and even thrive on it. Judging
by the range and intensity with which he spoke,
it is easy to imagine the tremendous amounts of
desire and drive he must have on tap that have
made him a world class athlete.
Before long he was analyzing his
record-breaking effort on the Stanford course.
'Extremely Satisfying'
"I was very pleased with my performance.
Being able to run the way I did was extremely
satisfying. The difference was knowing that if
anyone was with me in the race, I would be able
to run away from them. I felt confidence I
haven't felt in a long time."
Prefontaine has only one more collegiate race
to run. That will be on Nov. 19 at Spokane,
Wash, and one of his challengers will be the man
he duelled with Saturday, John Ngeno.
"I really look forward to running in the
NCAA finals — I feel like I'm ready to go all the
way. That is unless I die in the snow. But,
seriously, I do look forward to facing Ngeno on

his home course. And if injuries don't get in my
way, there is no reason I shouldn't have the
greatest year of my career."
Following his last NCAA race, Pre plans to
continue running through the indoor track
season. "After the NCAA's I plan to devote my
time to the indoor season. After that I'm going
to train for Europe — Europe is my prime
objective. This year I want to be fresh for the
Europeans, not worn out as I have been in the
past."
But Prefontaine does not automatically
anticipate another trip to the Olympics.
Doesn't Plan On Olympics
"Things will have to get much better before I
will compete in the 1976 Olympics. Right now I
don't plan on running. The Olympic Committee
situation in this country as it stands now has no
meaning — it's bullshit.
"Until our runners are afforded European
standards of treatment, there's no way I can
compete. First of all they have an unfair
advantage. Hell, the Europeans send all their
runners down to South America to run in the
warmth while we slog through the snow and the
cold.
"And as it stands now in America, the long
distance runner doesn't know where his next
meal will be coming from or whether he'll be on
foodstamps tomorrow. Running is 40 percent
conditioning and 50 percent mental, and if
you're working eight hours a day, how can you
run long distance like the Europeans?
"The Europeans have just about every
advantage over us. Unless there is a big change in
the way American athletes are trained, I don't
think I could afford another Olympics."
After his victory Sandoval said "I came to
run"and quietly accepted his award in a display
of honest modesty one could admire. Prefontaine
said "I wanted to win" and five minutes after he
had received his trophy, he accidently dropped it
in the mud. It seems that, in more than one
sense, what the great ones gain in spirited
intensity, they lose in grace.

way. That is unless I die in the snow. But,
seriously, I do look forward to facing Ngeno on

his home course. And if injuries don't get in my
way, there is no reason I shouldn't have the
greatest year of my career."
Following his last NCAA race, Pre plans to
continue running through the indoor track
season. "After the NCAA's I plan to devote my
time to the indoor season. After that I'm going
to train for Europe — Europe is my prime
objective. This year I want to be fresh for the
Europeans, not worn out as I have been in the
past."
But Prefontaine does not automatically
anticipate another trip to the Olympics.
Doesn't Plan On Olympics
"Things will have to get much better before I
will compete in the 1976 Olympics. Right now I
don't plan on running. The Olympic Committee
situation in this country as it stands now has no
meaning — it's bullshit.
"Until our runners are afforded European
standards of treatment, there's no way I can
compete. First of all they have an unfair
advantage. Hell, the Europeans send all their
runners down to South America to run in the
warmth while we slog through the snow and the
cold.
"And as it stands now in America, the long
distance runner doesn't know where his next
meal will be coming from or whether he'll be on
foodstamps tomorrow. Running is 40 percent
conditioning and 50 percent mental, and if
you're working eight hours a day, how can you
run long distance like the Europeans?
"The Europeans have just about every
advantage over us. Unless there is a big change in
the way American athletes are trained, I don't
think I could afford another Olympics."
After his victory Sandoval said "I came to
run"and quietly accepted his award in a display
of honest modesty one could admire. Prefontaine
said "I wanted to win" and five minutes after he
had received his trophy, he accidently dropped it
in the mud. It seems that, in more than one
sense, what the great ones gain in spirited
intensity, they lose in grace.

DEJECTION—Stanford defenders Geb Church (9 0), Pat Donovan (83)
and Jim Kaffen (22) looked disappointed Saturday during Stanford's
heartbreaking loss at the Los Angeles Coliseum, but Card coach Jack
Christiansen thinks Stanford will bounce back emotionally for this
week's game. The Cards face Oregon Saturday in a 1:30 p.m. game at
Stanford Stadium.
When Stanford's Tony Sandoval won the
individual title at the Southern Division Pac-8
cross country championships here three weeks
ago, Sandoval quietly exited from the scene and
was unobtrusively relaxing after the race. When
individual awards were announced, Tony had to
be prodded to emerge from the background
where he had quietly been talking to a few
friends.
Two weeks later Steve Prefontaine won the
Pac-8 cross country final championship on the
same course. But there was no quiet exit; indeed
a rather excited crowd of cross country/long
distance buffs descended upon the Olympian and
demanded autographs, poses for photographs and
tactical advice for upcoming amateur marathons
from the obviously spent Prefontaine.
Whereas Sandoval was content to withdraw
from the attentions of the crowd, Prefontaine
seemed to derive a gritty satisfaction from the
surging admirers. Some athletes shirk from the
demands of the crowd, but others, like
Prefontaine, enjoy and even thrive on it. Judging
by the range and intensity with which he spoke,
it is easy to imagine the tremendous amounts of
desire and drive he must have on tap that have
made him a world class athlete.
Before long he was analyzing his
record-breaking effort on the Stanford course.
'Extremely Satisfying'
"I was very pleased with my performance.
Being able to run the way I did was extremely
satisfying. The difference was knowing that if
anyone was with me in the race, I would be able
to run away from them. I felt confidence I
haven't felt in a long time."
Prefontaine has only one more collegiate race
to run. That will be on Nov. 19 at Spokane,
Wash, and one of his challengers will be the man
he duelled with Saturday, John Ngeno.
"I really look forward to running in the
NCAA finals — I feel like I'm ready to go all the
way. That is unless I die in the snow. But,
seriously, I do look forward to facing Ngeno on

his home course. And if injuries don't get in my
way, there is no reason I shouldn't have the
greatest year of my career."
