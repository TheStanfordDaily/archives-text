# Chris Thinks Cards Will Bounce Back
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford football coach Jack
Christiansen is still smarting from
Saturday's heartbreaking loss at
the Los Angeles Coliseum, but he
told the Northern California
Football Writers yesterday that
his team's deflated spirits should
be back to normal by Saturday.
"The USC game drained a lot
of people emotionally," Chris
said, "but I think our players are
as resilient as tennis balls — they'll
bounce back.
"It's tough to lose a game in
that fashion, especially when
you've got it won."
And especially when USC's
comeback was aided by two
highly questionable calls. "Being
an old defensive back 1 could go
on and on about that one,"
Christiansen replied when asked
about a pass interference penalty
against Jim Kaffen. The call gave
USC a 42-yard gain and led to a
Trojan touchdown. "The rule says
that if both men are looking for
the ball there's no interference —
and that's what it looked like to
us."
Chris also objected to a call
that stopped the clock with 15
seconds remaining. AnthonyDavis
apparently was tackled in bounds,
but the official decided otherwise.
If Davis had been ruled in bounds,
USC would have had time for
only one more play, the
last-second field goal may never
have become a reality, Stanford
might still be alive in the Rose
Bowl race. ...

"Of course its easy for us to
run the films back and forth,"
Chris said. "The officials don't
have that chance."
Now, though, all that is over
and the Cards must begin
concentrating on Oregon, a team
its publicist described yesterday as
"bent on self-destruction." Last
week the Ducks, who are 2-5 in
the conference and 2-7 overall,
held UCLA to its lowest total
yardage output of the year, but
lost 27-7 because of some suicidal
penalties and blunders.
"Offensive mistakes have killed
us," said publicist Hal Cowan.
"We returned the opening second
half kickoff 103 yards for a
touchdown but it was nullified for
clipping — things like that have
happened all year."
Christiansen said that this
year's Ducks are characterized by
a "typical Oregon trademark — a
hard-hitting defense." Oregon also
boasts the league's second leading
rusher in tailback Don Reynolds
and a free safety (Steve Donnelly)
who made 25 — count 'em, 25 —
tackles against Washington State.

Cardinal Notes: Here are some
additions to the myriad of
statistics accompanying Rod
Garcia's kicking performance
Saturday: Garcia's four field goals
in the contest tied the Pac-8
single-game record set by
Washington's Don Martin,
Stanford's Bill Shoemaker and
Effren Herrera of UCLA; his 14
points against USC moved him
into first place on the all-time
Stanford scoring list with 183
points, seven more than the
previous record held by Skip
Face; he now has 15 field goals (in
22 attempts) in 1973, shattering
his own Pac-8 season mark of 14
set in 1971. Garcia was named
Pac-8 offensive player of the week
for his efforts.
Stanford came out of the USC
game without any major injuries.
Linebackers Terry Pape, Gordie
Riegel and Geb Church and guard
Bruce Blackstone have minor
ailments, but all are expected to
play Saturday.
Christiansen has named Reggie
Ishman (offense), Joe Martin
(defense) and Forrie Martin
(special teams) as this week's
captains.
A Stanford victory against
Oregon would assure the Cards of
their sixth straight winning
season. Stanford hasn't had a
losing campaign since 1963, the
year John Ralston succeeded Jack
Curtice.
San Jose State lost to
California last Saturday, but
anyone watching ABC-TV's
NCAA scoreboard show was told
that the Spartans were victorious.
"National TV flashed us as the
winner," Rogers said, "and I guess
that's what xeally counts."
