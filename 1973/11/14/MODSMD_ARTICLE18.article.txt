# Polish Olympian Invents New Game
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
A former Polish national fencing champion visited Stanford last
week to introduce a new game of his own invention, which he calls
"Ringo."
"Ringo" gets its name from the mainpieceof equipment used in the
game, a soft rubber ring about seven inches in diameter. The players
toss the ring back and forth across a volleyball net, with points scored
whenever one player or team drops the ring or throws it out of
bounds.
Sounds simple? Try it. I did, and quickly got quite a workout. To
play the game well requires quick reactions and equally quick
decisions, for "Ringo" is as much a mental game as a physical one.
The inventor, patent-holder and one-man worldwide sales force,
Wlodzimierz Stryzyzewski (Wladek for short), demonstrated the game
for Jean Helliwell's fencing classes at the Women's gym last week, and
at the Stanford Fencing Association meeting last Tuesday night. He
invited the fencers to play first with him and then among themselves,
and the reaction was enthusiastic.

Wladek invented the game as a
training program for himself in
order to prepare for the Polish
Olympic trials several years ago.
He was delayed in beginning his
regular training, and in order to
catch up, wanted an activity that
would test both his physical and
mental reactions, both absolutely
crucial in fencing.
He was reminded of a
makeshift toy he had used as a
child, a baby-buggy tire. After
much effort, he found a Polish
manufacturer who could produce
a seamless soft rubber ring of
about the same size.
Wladek went on to expose the
other high-ranking fencers and
coaches to his new game. They
were more attracted to it than
volleyball, which all too
frequently results fn jammed
fingers and other minor hand
injuries which can be annoying to
a fencer.
His enthusiasm for the game
goes far beyond fencing, however.
He believes it has the potential for
being a truly international
participation sport, as widespread
as soccer is as a spectator sport.
He sees no cultural, national or
economic barriers to the game,
which has simple rules and
requires no equipment other than
rings and a net. Even "a line
strung between two trees" can
serve as a net, he adds.
Wladek has tried, although
unsuccessfully, to interest the
United Nations in the game,
which the French sports
newspaper L'Equipe called "une
Esperanto du sport mondiale," an
international language of sport.
He sees his new game as a chance
for everyone in the world to
participate in a sport which is
both physically and mentally
challenging.
