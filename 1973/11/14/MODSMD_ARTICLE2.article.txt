# Prospective Law Students Face Toughest Competition To Date
## Law Students’ Competition 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Like the pre-med before him,
today's candidate for law school faces
the stiffest competition imaginable as
a potential law student.
In 1963, over 30,000 took the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT). Last
year, nearly 122,000 took the exam.
This quadrupling of prospective law
students in the last 10 years has given
rise to the pre-law "red-hot," for so
long a designation assigned solely to
the pre-med.
Why the law profession? Students
had various answers at last week's
Pacific Pre-Law Conference where
admissions officers from 40 law
schools throughout the country were
represented. "I enjoy studying and I'm
interested in a profession useful to
society," said one coed.
"I finally decided on law school
after the Watergate scandal was
publicized," said another student. "I
want to make sure those kinds of
'dirty tricks' by lawyers become the
exception rather than the rule."
'Making Money'
One freshman at the pre-law
conference observed, "I guess all these
seniors are interested in making
money. I want to help people with
their legal problems, but sure, I want
to live comfortably too."
The competition throughout the
country is so intense that some
students have resorted to hiring others
to take the LSAT for them.
The Washington Post recently
reported that the increasingly tight law
school admissions situation has
prompted apprehensive candidates to
hire "ringers," some of whom offer a
money-back guarantee if they fail to
get a qualifying score on the LSAT.
This practice has become such a
problem that, according to the Post,
all candidates will have to submit to
thumb printing this year.
High Scores
Last year. Harvard Law School
received 6500 applications for a class
of 500. Twenty percent of those who
applied had LSAT scores of over 700
(on an 800-point scale) and a 4.0 grade

point average (CPA).
At Yale Law School, 850 of the
applicants had LSAT scores of 750 or
better. The median score at Michigan
was 715.
Competition for California schools,
including Stanford Law School and
Boalt Hall at Berkeley, is also rough.
Hundreds of qualified applicants are
denied admission each year.
One law school admissions officer
attributed the tremendous rise in
applicants to the reaction against the
"8 a.m. to 5 p.m. routine of being
fired and laid-off. Law enables a
person to be independent and flexible

with opportunities available in
government service, small firms, large
firms and legal research."
At the pre-law conference last
week, students clustered around the
Harvard and Yale representatives as
they spoke informally about
admissions policies, financial aid and
the law profession.
All schools stressed that their
decisions were not based solely on the
LSAT score and grade point average.
Beyond the absolute minimum of a
600 LSAT score and a 3.0 GPA, the
admissions committees look for the
