# Prospective Law Students Face Toughest Competition To Date
## Law Studentsâ€™ Competition 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Like the pre-med before him,
today's candidate for law school faces
the stiffest competition imaginable as
a potential law student.
In 1963, over 30,000 took the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT). Last
year, nearly 122,000 took the exam.
This quadrupling of prospective law
students in the last 10 years has given
rise to the pre-law "red-hot," for so
long a designation assigned solely to
the pre-med.
Why the law profession? Students
had various answers at last week's
Pacific Pre-Law Conference where
admissions officers from 40 law
schools throughout the country were
represented. "I enjoy studying and I'm
interested in a profession useful to
society," said one coed.
"I finally decided on law school
after the Watergate scandal was
publicized," said another student. "I
want to make sure those kinds of
'dirty tricks' by lawyers become the
exception rather than the rule."
'Making Money'
One freshman at the pre-law
conference observed, "I guess all these
seniors are interested in making
money. I want to help people with
their legal problems, but sure, I want
to live comfortably too."
The competition throughout the
country is so intense that some
students have resorted to hiring others
to take the LSAT for them.
The Washington Post recently
reported that the increasingly tight law
school admissions situation has
prompted apprehensive candidates to
hire "ringers," some of whom offer a
money-back guarantee if they fail to
get a qualifying score on the LSAT.
This practice has become such a
problem that, according to the Post,
all candidates will have to submit to
thumb printing this year.
High Scores
Last year. Harvard Law School
received 6500 applications for a class
of 500. Twenty percent of those who
applied had LSAT scores of over 700
(on an 800-point scale) and a 4.0 grade

point average (CPA).
At Yale Law School, 850 of the
applicants had LSAT scores of 750 or
better. The median score at Michigan
was 715.
Competition for California schools,
including Stanford Law School and
Boalt Hall at Berkeley, is also rough.
Hundreds of qualified applicants are
denied admission each year.
One law school admissions officer
attributed the tremendous rise in
applicants to the reaction against the
"8 a.m. to 5 p.m. routine of being
fired and laid-off. Law enables a
person to be independent and flexible

with opportunities available in
government service, small firms, large
firms and legal research."
At the pre-law conference last
week, students clustered around the
Harvard and Yale representatives as
they spoke informally about
admissions policies, financial aid and
the law profession.
All schools stressed that their
decisions were not based solely on the
LSAT score and grade point average.
Beyond the absolute minimum of a
600 LSAT score and a 3.0 GPA, the
admissions committees look for the
"sparkle" in each applicant.
'Diversity' Important
Such "sparkle" might include
extra-curricular, and possibly
law-related activities, courses or
minority status. Harvard's admissions
representative thought "diversity" of
the individual was an important
consideration.
Students at the conference seemed
most interested in applying to the
most competitive law schools.
A senior with a 3.7 GPA and a 746
LSAT score looked forward to the
"ultimate challenge of law school." He
applied to Harvard, Yale, Stanford and
other "top-rated" law schools.
A communication major with a 3.6
GPA considers Boalt, Hastings and
UCLA as schools to which she had the
best chance of acceptance.
Course Grades
Equal in importance to the LSAT is
the grade point average. However, the
GPA is considered in conjunction with
the courses taken.
Thelton Henderson, assistant dean
of law school admissions here, said, "A
tough year course in calculus" is
looked upon favorably. He added that
courses which help develop logical

thinking such as philosophy and logic
courses provide good training for law
school.
Other law schools recommended
courses in economics and empirical
research as aids for law school training
rather than as required studies for
admission. They noted the importance
of exposure to the broad range of the
social sciences.
The strength of the Stanford degree
as opposed to one from another school
is difficult to measure. Harvard's
representative called Stanford a
"source of individuals, a feeder" for
the law school class there. Other
admissions officers claimed
distinctions between various
institutions were "slight at best."

UCLA as schools to which she had the
best chance of acceptance.
Course Grades
Equal in importance to the LSAT is
the grade point average. However, the
GPA is considered in conjunction with
the courses taken.
Thelton Henderson, assistant dean
of law school admissions here, said, "A
tough year course in calculus" is
looked upon favorably. He added that
courses which help develop logical

thinking such as philosophy and logic
courses provide good training for law
school.
Other law schools recommended
courses in economics and empirical
research as aids for law school training
rather than as required studies for
admission. They noted the importance
of exposure to the broad range of the
social sciences.
The strength of the Stanford degree
as opposed to one from another school
is difficult to measure. Harvard's
representative called Stanford a
"source of individuals, a feeder" for
the law school class there. Other
admissions officers claimed
distinctions between various
institutions were "slight at best."
Like the pre-med before him,
today's candidate for law school faces
the stiffest competition imaginable as
a potential law student.
In 1963, over 30,000 took the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT). Last
year, nearly 122,000 took the exam.
This quadrupling of prospective law
students in the last 10 years has given
rise to the pre-law "red-hot," for so
long a designation assigned solely to
the pre-med.
Why the law profession? Students
had various answers at last week's
Pacific Pre-Law Conference where
admissions officers from 40 law
schools throughout the country were
represented. "I enjoy studying and I'm
interested in a profession useful to
society," said one coed.
"I finally decided on law school
after the Watergate scandal was
publicized," said another student. "I
want to make sure those kinds of
'dirty tricks' by lawyers become the
exception rather than the rule."
'Making Money'
One freshman at the pre-law
conference observed, "I guess all these
seniors are interested in making
money. I want to help people with
their legal problems, but sure, I want
to live comfortably too."
The competition throughout the
country is so intense that some
students have resorted to hiring others
to take the LSAT for them.
The Washington Post recently
reported that the increasingly tight law
school admissions situation has
prompted apprehensive candidates to
hire "ringers," some of whom offer a
money-back guarantee if they fail to
get a qualifying score on the LSAT.
This practice has become such a
problem that, according to the Post,
all candidates will have to submit to
thumb printing this year.
High Scores
Last year. Harvard Law School
received 6500 applications for a class
of 500. Twenty percent of those who
applied had LSAT scores of over 700
(on an 800-point scale) and a 4.0 grade

point average (CPA).
At Yale Law School, 850 of the
applicants had LSAT scores of 750 or
better. The median score at Michigan
was 715.
Competition for California schools,
including Stanford Law School and
Boalt Hall at Berkeley, is also rough.
Hundreds of qualified applicants are
denied admission each year.
One law school admissions officer
attributed the tremendous rise in
applicants to the reaction against the
"8 a.m. to 5 p.m. routine of being
fired and laid-off. Law enables a
person to be independent and flexible

with opportunities available in
government service, small firms, large
firms and legal research."
At the pre-law conference last
week, students clustered around the
Harvard and Yale representatives as
they spoke informally about
admissions policies, financial aid and
the law profession.
All schools stressed that their
decisions were not based solely on the
LSAT score and grade point average.
Beyond the absolute minimum of a
600 LSAT score and a 3.0 GPA, the
admissions committees look for the
"sparkle" in each applicant.
'Diversity' Important
Such "sparkle" might include
extra-curricular, and possibly
law-related activities, courses or
minority status. Harvard's admissions
representative thought "diversity" of
the individual was an important
consideration.
Students at the conference seemed
most interested in applying to the
most competitive law schools.
A senior with a 3.7 GPA and a 746
LSAT score looked forward to the
"ultimate challenge of law school." He
applied to Harvard, Yale, Stanford and
other "top-rated" law schools.

admissions policies, financial aid and
the law profession.
All schools stressed that their
decisions were not based solely on the
LSAT score and grade point average.
Beyond the absolute minimum of a
600 LSAT score and a 3.0 GPA, the
admissions committees look for the
"sparkle" in each applicant.
'Diversity' Important
Such "sparkle" might include
extra-curricular, and possibly
law-related activities, courses or
minority status. Harvard's admissions
representative thought "diversity" of
the individual was an important
consideration.
Students at the conference seemed
most interested in applying to the
most competitive law schools.
A senior with a 3.7 GPA and a 746
LSAT score looked forward to the
"ultimate challenge of law school." He
applied to Harvard, Yale, Stanford and
other "top-rated" law schools.
A communication major with a 3.6
GPA considers Boalt, Hastings and
UCLA as schools to which she had the
best chance of acceptance.
Course Grades
Equal in importance to the LSAT is
the grade point average. However, the
GPA is considered in conjunction with
the courses taken.
Thelton Henderson, assistant dean
of law school admissions here, said, "A
tough year course in calculus" is
looked upon favorably. He added that
courses which help develop logical

thinking such as philosophy and logic
courses provide good training for law
school.
Other law schools recommended
courses in economics and empirical
research as aids for law school training
rather than as required studies for
admission. They noted the importance
of exposure to the broad range of the
social sciences.
The strength of the Stanford degree
as opposed to one from another school
is difficult to measure. Harvard's
representative called Stanford a
"source of individuals, a feeder" for
the law school class there. Other
admissions officers claimed
distinctions between various
institutions were "slight at best."
