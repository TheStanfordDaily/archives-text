## The
						Incompetent 49ers

"What goes up, must come down "
—David Clayton Thomas
Obscured by the rise from the dead of the
amazing Los Angeles Rams has been the fall to the
grave of the San Francisco 49ers. Like a runaway
BART train, the 49ers have plummeted from
near-greatness to the depths of total incompetence.
What has happened to a team which entered the
season as the only NFL club to have won three
straight divisional championships? Last season the
49ers seem destined to make at least the NFL
Championship game, if not the Super Bowl, when
all of a sudden they slipped into last minute
complacency against the Dallas Cowboys and lost a
game they should have easily won.
That playoff game should go down in football
history as marking the 49ers' Waterloo. The San
Franciscans reached the high point of this season in
their opening game when they gave Miami a good
battle before losing in unholy hot conditions at the
Orange Bowl. Since that game, the locals have won
only three games — against Denver, Atlanta and
New Orleans.
Any discussion of the 49ers' problems has to
begin with a look at a corps of running backs that is
mediocre at best. A writer in one of those
innumerable pre-season, pro football magazines
naively said that "the backfield 'problem' should be
assessed in light of the fact that the 49ers have
quantity to help ease their worries over quality."
Although this magazine set sports journalism
back 40 years with comments like that, it at least
complemented its stupidity with consistency.
Elsewhere in his critique of the current NFC West
cellar-dwellers, the magazine's writer said, "The
49ers have more resources and fewer question marks
than most of their competition this year in their
division, their conference and their league."As of
today, the 49ers also have fewer wins than the New
Orleans Saints.
The 49ers lack both a breakaway threat and
punishing power runner at a time when a large
number of pro teams have at least one back who fits
each of these descriptions. The word journeyman
might very well have been invented to describe the
likes of Larry Schreiber, Jimmy Thomas, Doug
Cunningham, Ken Willard and Vic Washington.

Now that age has finally caught up with John
Brodie, the Niners' passing attack that has
constituted 99 percent of their offense for years,
has been unable to compensate for their nearly
non-existent running attack. The addition of
scrappy Danny Abramowicz to a receiving corps
that already includes All-Pros Gene Washington and
Ted Kwalick was a very wise move. But although it
prevents defenses from always double-covering
Washington and Kwalick, it does nothing to balance
the 49ers' attack.
With Brodie rapidly deteriorating, the burden of
the passing game fell on Steve Spurrier, who has not
come anywhere near the brilliant form he
demonstrated last season when Brodie was injured.
Coach Dick Nolan started third-stringer Joe Reed on
Sunday when the 49ers lost to Washington 33-9 and
Reed hit on 20 of 36 passes for 233 yards to inject a
ray of hope into the 49er future. But as usual, Reed
was victimized by four 49er fumbles and with that
kind of help, even God himself would have trouble
quarterbacking a team to victory.
On defense, some of the 49ers' biggest problems
center around over-inflated egos instead cf a lack of
physical ability. Defensive end Cedrick Hardman is
one of the finest pass rushers in football, but his ego
seemingly prevents him from improving his defense
against the run. So everybody runs around, over and
through Hardman.
And then there is the inimitable cornerback,
Bruce Taylor. Taylor was an NFL phenom as a
rookie four years ago and he is still one of the more
capable punt return men in football. Unfortunately
Taylor still makes the kinds of mistakes which are
fatal for defensive backs and they are definitely not
caused by a lack of physical talent. Anyone who
saw that ill-fated Dallas game last season knows
exactly how costly Taylor's mistakes can be.
If the Niners continue down the path of failure,
they could find some solace among high draft
choices this winter. They could find the athletes
who might eliminate the glaring weaknesses which
have finally caught up with an otherwise solid
football team. But judging from their draft
performance in recent years, they won't. If they
draft true to form, they'll probably pick Rod Garcia
and use him as a middle linebacker.
