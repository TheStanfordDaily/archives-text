## 
### MARCY O'KEEFE 
Womens' swimming coach
Betsy Weeks predicts tomorrow's
meet against UC-Davis and Chico
State will be "the biggest and
toughest meet we've had yet."
UC-Davis' swim team proved
its stength in the annual NCIAC
relays held two weeks ago at
Hayward, coming in third with
116 points compared to
Sacramento State's 124 and
Stanford's 118.
"I think we have a good chance
to take it," commented Weeks,
"but the meet will definitely test
our weaknesses and strong points.
I think the meet can be won not
so much on individual
performance, but on an entire
team effort."
Stanford's record to date
includes wins over San Jose State,
San Francisco State and Santa
Clara. After tomorrow's meet to
be held at Davis, Stanford takes
on Sacramento State on Nov. 20
in the last meet of the season
before the NCIAC
Championships.
"The meets are important as
far as getting interest going in
competition," remarked Weeks,
"but ftiuch more emphasis is put

on the NCIAC Championships.
The winner of the Championships,
regardless of various wins and
losses up until then, is the NCIAC
champion."
The 1 97 3 NCIAC
Championships will be held on
Saturday, Dec. 1 at Humboldt.
Tomorrow's meet against Davis
and Chico will probably consist of
18 events, the women swimming a
six-lane pool with two entries
from each team competing. First
place swimmers will receive six
points, second four points, third
three, fourth two and fifth one.
The school accumulating the most
points wins the meet.
Four new Stanford records
have been established since the
beginning of the season. Vicki
Hayes swam the 100-yard
breaststroke in 1:15.4, the
400-yard medley relay team of
Mei Ong, Hayes, Sue Trupin and
Annette Leusbhel recorded a
4:32.7 clocking, the 400 freestyle
relay team of Jackie Brink, Becky
Burchell, Diane Dillon and Kathy
Heinze clocked 4:14.9 and the
100-yard medley relay team of
Jennifer Eagleston, Laurie Gill,
Marge Meek and Sue Trupin set a
new school record of 57.6.

"but ftiuch more emphasis is put

on the NCIAC Championships.
The winner of the Championships,
regardless of various wins and
losses up until then, is the NCIAC
champion."

Championships will be held on
Saturday, Dec. 1 at Humboldt.
