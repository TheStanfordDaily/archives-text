# Women Seek Hockey Win
## 
### 
Stanford's women's field
hockey team will seek its fourth
victory of the season tomorrow
when the Cards host Cal
State-Hayward in a 3 p.m. game
on Stanford's Women's Field.
Coach Shirley Schoof, who
says her team "has been playing
extremely well as a unit," predicts
that the varsity won't have much
trouble with Hayward, an
inexperienced team that Stanford
trounced 6-0 earlier this year.
However Schoof anticipates a
rugged junior varsity battle
tomorrow, as Stanford's JV's host
California in the "Little Big
Game." The two teams will be
playing for an antiquated hockey
stick decorated with red ribbon,
field hockey's version of the axe
that traditionally goes to the
winner of the Cal-Stanford
football game.
The varsity, which currently
sports a 3-0-1 record, has been
relying on the standout play of
goalie Betsy Morris and the
offensive production of Marina
Ballyntine and freshman Kathy
Levinson, both of whom have
scored six goals so far this year.
The junior varsity, now 2-1-1
on the season, has been paced by
center forward Ann Walker, who
has scored seven goals.
