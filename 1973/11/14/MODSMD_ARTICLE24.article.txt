Illegal Gifts Revealed
WASHINGTON — Revelations of illegal
campaign gifts hit Democrats and Republicans alike
yesterday as two corporations pleaded guilty to
federal charges and a third was accused in Senate
testimony of a cover-up conspiracy.
Gulf Oil Corp., which previously admitted
making an illegal $100,000 gift to President Nixon's
re-election campaign, pleaded guilty to that
violation yesterday and to illegally donating
$10,000 to the campaigns of Sen. Henry M. Jackson
of Washington and $15,000 to Rep. Wilbur D. Mills
of Arkansas.
Also yesterday, a subsidiary of Ashland Oil Inc.
pleaded guilty in federal court in Kentucky to
making an illegal $100,000 gift to Nixon's
campaign. The subsidiary, Ashland Petroleum
Gabon, had previously admitted the Nixon gift.
Gulf and Ashland both were fined $5000, and
two company officials also were fined an additional
$1000 but escaped jail terms because they had
volunteered their co-operation to the special
Watergate prosecution force.
In testimony before the Senate Watergate
committee, two employees of the American Ship
Building Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, said they and six
other employees had been given bonuses and
ordered to give the after-tax proceeds to political
campaigns.
At least $25,000 in disguised corporate money
went into Nixon's re-election campaign, they said.
But thousands more went to buy tickets to a
$1000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for Republican

Senate candidates and $500 tickets for a
Democratic fund-raising affair in Washington.
Israel Holds Checkpoints
Israel refused to relinquish its checkpoints on the
Cairo-Suez highway yesterday and Premier Golda
Meir declared she would not pull Israeli forces back
to the Oct. 22 cease-fire lines as demanded by
Egypt.
The commander of U.N. peacekeeping forces,
Finnish Maj. Gen. Ensio Siilasvuo, flew to Tel Aviv
after a visit to a disputed checkpoint on the
highway to Suez.
A U.N. spokesman said Israelis had a fist fight
Monday with U.N. peacekeepers trying to take over
the checkpoint. The U.N. post was later permitted
to remain, but an Israeli control point continued in
operation nearby.
High Israeli officials said the Israeli checkpoints
would be turned over to the United Nations only
simultaneously with a prisoner exchange.
Meir, in a policy address to parliament, declined
to pull Israeli troops back to their positions of Oct.
22, when a cease-fire was first called. Instead she
proposed that Israeli and Egyptian troops withdraw
to the 1967 Suez Canal lines.
This suggestion had been made before by the
Israelis and would mean Egyptian withdrawal from
the east bank of the Suez Canal at the same time
Israel gives up territory it occupied on the west
bank during the October war.
Response To Nixon Meeting
WASHINGTON — The White House said
yesterday there has been "over-all positive reaction"

from Republican party leaders and members of
Congress to President Nixon's personal Watergate
defense.
The President was holding a third session
yesterday evening in the series of six he plans this
week to discuss the issues face-to-face with all the
Republican members of Congress and some
Democrats.
There was still no White House response to a call
from the Senate Watergate committee for Nixon to
let its members question him on Watergate matters
at his earliest convenience.
The committee voted 5 to 1, sources said, to
request the meeting and ask the President to make
available to them all relevant tape recordings and
documents regarding the Watergate investigation.
Another Watergate Prosecutor?
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee approved by voice vote yesterday a bill
that would place the office of special Watergate
prosecutor under federal court jurisdiction.
The committee also gave the prosecutor the job
of assisting its investigation of grounds for the
possible impeachment of President Nixon.
The establishment of the special prosecutor's
office in the courts is designed to make the post
independent of the Nixon administration.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today with chance of showers. Fair
and colder tonight. Low temperature tonight in 40s.
High Wednesday and Thursday in 50s. Chance of
rain 30 percent today.

at his earliest convenience.
The committee voted 5 to 1, sources said, to
request the meeting and ask the President to make
available to them all relevant tape recordings and

Another Watergate Prosecutor?
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee approved by voice vote yesterday a bill
that would place the office of special Watergate
prosecutor under federal court jurisdiction.
The committee also gave the prosecutor the job
of assisting its investigation of grounds for the
possible impeachment of President Nixon.
The establishment of the special prosecutor's
office in the courts is designed to make the post
independent of the Nixon administration.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today with chance of showers. Fair
and colder tonight. Low temperature tonight in 40s.
High Wednesday and Thursday in 50s. Chance of
rain 30 percent today.
Illegal Gifts Revealed
WASHINGTON — Revelations of illegal
campaign gifts hit Democrats and Republicans alike
yesterday as two corporations pleaded guilty to
federal charges and a third was accused in Senate
testimony of a cover-up conspiracy.
Gulf Oil Corp., which previously admitted
making an illegal $100,000 gift to President Nixon's
re-election campaign, pleaded guilty to that
violation yesterday and to illegally donating
$10,000 to the campaigns of Sen. Henry M. Jackson
of Washington and $15,000 to Rep. Wilbur D. Mills
of Arkansas.
Also yesterday, a subsidiary of Ashland Oil Inc.
pleaded guilty in federal court in Kentucky to
making an illegal $100,000 gift to Nixon's
campaign. The subsidiary, Ashland Petroleum
Gabon, had previously admitted the Nixon gift.
Gulf and Ashland both were fined $5000, and
two company officials also were fined an additional
$1000 but escaped jail terms because they had
volunteered their co-operation to the special
Watergate prosecution force.
In testimony before the Senate Watergate
committee, two employees of the American Ship
Building Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, said they and six
other employees had been given bonuses and
ordered to give the after-tax proceeds to political
campaigns.
At least $25,000 in disguised corporate money
went into Nixon's re-election campaign, they said.
But thousands more went to buy tickets to a
$1000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for Republican

Senate candidates and $500 tickets for a
Democratic fund-raising affair in Washington.
Israel Holds Checkpoints
Israel refused to relinquish its checkpoints on the
Cairo-Suez highway yesterday and Premier Golda
Meir declared she would not pull Israeli forces back
to the Oct. 22 cease-fire lines as demanded by
Egypt.
The commander of U.N. peacekeeping forces,
Finnish Maj. Gen. Ensio Siilasvuo, flew to Tel Aviv
after a visit to a disputed checkpoint on the
highway to Suez.
A U.N. spokesman said Israelis had a fist fight
Monday with U.N. peacekeepers trying to take over
the checkpoint. The U.N. post was later permitted
to remain, but an Israeli control point continued in
operation nearby.
High Israeli officials said the Israeli checkpoints
would be turned over to the United Nations only
simultaneously with a prisoner exchange.
Meir, in a policy address to parliament, declined
to pull Israeli troops back to their positions of Oct.
22, when a cease-fire was first called. Instead she
proposed that Israeli and Egyptian troops withdraw
to the 1967 Suez Canal lines.
This suggestion had been made before by the
Israelis and would mean Egyptian withdrawal from
the east bank of the Suez Canal at the same time
Israel gives up territory it occupied on the west
bank during the October war.
Response To Nixon Meeting
WASHINGTON — The White House said
yesterday there has been "over-all positive reaction"

from Republican party leaders and members of
Congress to President Nixon's personal Watergate
defense.
The President was holding a third session
yesterday evening in the series of six he plans this
week to discuss the issues face-to-face with all the
Republican members of Congress and some
Democrats.
There was still no White House response to a call
from the Senate Watergate committee for Nixon to
let its members question him on Watergate matters
at his earliest convenience.
