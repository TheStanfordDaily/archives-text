# Stanford Tax Exempt Status Jeopardized?
## Chapel Closed As 'Impeach Nixon' Center 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Dean of the Chapel Robert G.H.
Kelly has halted the use of Memorial
Church as a campus headquarters for
the movement to impeach President
Nixon after being advised by three
University administrators that such use
might jeopardize the University's tax
exempt status.
Instead, Kelly said, the church "is
not officially an office for the
impeachment of the President," but
"we continue to advise students as to
who their congressman is" and how to
contact him.
Kelly met on Oct. 22 with Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger, Vice Provost
Robert Rosenzweig and James Siena,
legal adviser to the president, after
Augsburger had expressed his concern
to Kelly over the church's
impeachment activities.
According to Siena, "We had
understood and Dean Kelly confirmed
that one of the extensions at the
chapel had been given out... as a
number to call" to get information on
impeachment.
Kelly had given out the church
number for that purpose at several
public gatherings following the firing
of Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox on Oct. 20.

Kelly said he was told that by
giving out the church telephone
number for those interested in
impeachment activities, he "was in
violation of University guidelines."
The guidelines in question, drawn
up by then-Provost Richard Lyman in
1970 following the Cambodian
incursion uproar, specify in part that
"University duplicating machines,
computers, telephones or other
equipment or supplies may not be
used for political or other
non-University purposes, nor may any
office employee or any other
employee of the University be asked
to perform tasks in any way related to
political activities while on regular
duty."
These guidelines were ostensibly
put into effect to guard against any
possibility that the University would
lose its tax-exempt status.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady,
who has been closely associated with
the campus impeachment effort, said
he would be "very surprised if the
guidelines drawn up by then Provost
Lyman are not in reality much more
restrictive than what the law actually
requires.
Restriction 'Vague'
"I find the restriction against
political activities absurdly vague in

that what Richard Lyman does every
single day is political," O'Grady
observed.
Although Kelly said he "saw no
point in defying" the administration
since the church is covered by the
guidelines in their present form, he
said, "The church, by its very nature,
is different than other departments of
the University and therefore should
not fall under the guidelines."
These guidelines "appeared to me
to be interfering with the purpose of
the church as established by Mrs.
Stanford: to take care of the moral
and religious education of the
students," Kelly noted.
'Distortion Of Religion'
"In my opinion, action is the
essence of religion, and it is a
distortion of religion merely to talk
about things and not to act on them,"
he said.
In addition to the arguments that
the church was in violation of the
guidelines and that the tax-exempt
status might be affected. Kelly said the
administrators also "made the
argument that academic freedom
demands that no part of the University
can use its resources to sunoort a
particular political position because
that intrinsically interferes" with the
freedom of those who do not support
that position.
Kelly conceded the administration
arguments "certainly have substance,"
but said he would continue his effort
to remove the church from the
restrictions imposed by the guidelines.
"There is no such thing as virginal
neutrality," Kelly said. "I think the
University, by staying neutral, is
supporting the status quo."
Difference Of Kind
Siena disagreed, saying, "It is a
difference not only of degree, but of
kind if the University decides not to
take a position on impeachment
instead of taking one for or against."
In further defense of his position,
Kelly said, "In the absence of a charter
setting out the precise nature of the
church, the church takes on the
theological complexion of the Dean of
the Chapel at that particular time."
Lyman, however, disputed Kelly,
claiming, "That seems in some conflict
with it being a university church and
not a community church. I think a

university church has an obligation to
represent all points of view."
Siena agreed with Lyman's
judgment, saying that Kelly "is not
free like a minister who is paid by his
congregation and who gets pitched out
if they don't agree with him. He is a
University employee" and therefore
has a responsibility to those who
disagree with him.
Can't Be Released
Lyman said that the church cannot
be released from University guidelines
because it "is as much a part of the
University as [are] the rest" of the
facilities covered by the guidelines.
"If you have a law that entitles you
to tax exempt status," Lyman said,
"then you're not at liberty to play by
those rules as you see fit."
Although he said there has been
"very little pressure" from trustees or
alumni regarding the church's
impeachment activities, Lyman added,
"I think there are plenty of people
who would question whether that is
the proper activity of the church."
