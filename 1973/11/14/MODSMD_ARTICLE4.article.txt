# Policy Statement Due On Campus Vendors
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
A new statement of University
policy towards vendors in White Plaza
is now being assessed by staff lawyer
Mike Hudnall for submission to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
Dale Snape, assistant to the dean,
said he hopes the new statement will
create "a reason for having them here,
rather than just no reason for not
having them here." For the past year
Snape has been dealing with the
vendors directly on a
"problem-by-problem" basis, without
a defined University policy.
The policy now being considered
would encourage craft and flower
vendors for the creative atmosphere
they add to White Plaza. "We hope to
fit the vendors under the same
category as an art display in
Tresidder," explained Snape. He plans
a laissez-faire attitude, although selling
prepared food will still be prohibited.
The policy statement was drawn up
by a committee of administrators from
University Relations, the dean's office
and the finance office.
The major problem in forming the
policy statement, according to Snape,
is deciding which vendors encourage
"the joyous, creative atmosphere we
want to preserve ... It's boggling to
try to define the difference between a

necklace vendor and the Fuller Brush
man."
Although the members of the
committee want to keep the vendors
on campus, they said that a definite
policy is necessary in terms of
practical considerations such as
University liability, space and tax
status.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Dan Williams said that the University
now enjoys a tax-free status as an
academic institution. Snape explained
that on-campus services such as the
bank and barber shop are assessed "on
sort of a square-foot basis." The range
of the vendors, however, is not clearly
defined.
When solicitation by outside
business on campus first became an
issue, the University set up limitations.
Businesses could hire a student
representative, who received a permit
from the student employment office,
explained Snape.
A few years ago, however, when
students began holding "spring candle
and leather sales, operating from
dorms or trailers," they were also
allowed to sell in White Plaza, Snape
said. Since then, more professionals
have been operating similar businesses,
and the University has continued to let
them use the area with little
administrative control.

LAISSEZ FAIRE — The University is working on a new official status for the art
and nature vendors in White Plaza. Craft displays lend a creative atmosphere
which some administrators want to encourage.
