# Tuition Hike Approved By Board Of Trustees
## 
### JOHN FREED 
University trustees yesterday
approved a $240 hike in next year's
tuition rate after rejecting a proposal
similar to one advocated by the ASSU
Senate, which would have held the
increase to $195.
The 7.6 percent increase will set
tuition here at $3375, up from $3135
this year. The ASSU Senate had asked
for the trustees to limit the hike to six
percent, or about $198.
Vice Provost for Budget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti had
earlier warned that a rise of less than

the full $240 requested by the
Administration could have adverse
effects on next year's budget.
"We do know the budget will be
very tight with the 7.6 percent
increase. The [ASSU] reduction
would be about $400,000. That's no
small change," Bacchetti commented.
Studies of incoming freshmen over
the last few years have shown that
nearly a quarter of those accepted here
who went to other schools did so for
monetary reasons. The number has not
fluctuated much despite rising tuition
in those years, according to Bacchetti.

"The number is not extremely
large, but it is significant and we do
consider it,"he noted.
Stanford's hike will put its tuition
on a par with Ivy League schools.
Formerly it had lagged behind these
schools in tuition charges.
Although the University says its
policy of meeting "the demonstrated
need of all undergraduates" will not
change, another University bulletin
noted that "the ratio of one dollar in
every three ... being offset in
scholarship aid from some source
continues to hold." This would
indicate that students on financial aid
would have to bear an average $160
tuition increase. Bacchetti says the
figure is misleading because each
financial aid case is considered
individually.
'Highest Priority'
"Financial aid has always had the
highest priority in the budget,"
Bacchetti claimed.
At the meeting yesterday, the
trustees also approved tuition hikes for
the graduate schools. Medical School
tuition will rise 7.2 percent to $3570,
while Business School tuition will go
up 5.26 percent to $3600.
Frank Newman, director of
University Relations, expressed
concern for students on financial aid
and stated that the University has
made efforts to expand student aid
programs.
Two-Sided Equation
"There really are two sides to the
equation," Newman contended. "One
is how much does it cost to go here,
and the other is how much aid is
provided to students to pay for it. In
the last five years, we have been able
to create a whole series of plans to
help students."
These include the California State
Scholarship program as well as
increased University aid programs.
Newman noted that the maximum
grant to a California state scholar has
risen from $1500 to its current level of
$2500.

$2500.
University trustees yesterday
approved a $240 hike in next year's
tuition rate after rejecting a proposal
similar to one advocated by the ASSU
Senate, which would have held the
increase to $195.
The 7.6 percent increase will set
tuition here at $3375, up from $3135
this year. The ASSU Senate had asked
for the trustees to limit the hike to six
percent, or about $198.
Vice Provost for Budget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti had
earlier warned that a rise of less than

the full $240 requested by the
Administration could have adverse
effects on next year's budget.
"We do know the budget will be
very tight with the 7.6 percent
increase. The [ASSU] reduction
would be about $400,000. That's no
small change," Bacchetti commented.
Studies of incoming freshmen over
the last few years have shown that
nearly a quarter of those accepted here
who went to other schools did so for
monetary reasons. The number has not
fluctuated much despite rising tuition
in those years, according to Bacchetti.

"The number is not extremely
large, but it is significant and we do
consider it,"he noted.
Stanford's hike will put its tuition
on a par with Ivy League schools.
Formerly it had lagged behind these
schools in tuition charges.
Although the University says its
policy of meeting "the demonstrated
need of all undergraduates" will not
change, another University bulletin
noted that "the ratio of one dollar in
every three ... being offset in
scholarship aid from some source
continues to hold." This would
indicate that students on financial aid
would have to bear an average $160
tuition increase. Bacchetti says the
figure is misleading because each
financial aid case is considered
individually.
'Highest Priority'
"Financial aid has always had the
highest priority in the budget,"
Bacchetti claimed.
At the meeting yesterday, the
trustees also approved tuition hikes for
the graduate schools. Medical School
tuition will rise 7.2 percent to $3570,
while Business School tuition will go
up 5.26 percent to $3600.
Frank Newman, director of
University Relations, expressed
concern for students on financial aid
and stated that the University has
made efforts to expand student aid
programs.
Two-Sided Equation
"There really are two sides to the
equation," Newman contended. "One
is how much does it cost to go here,
and the other is how much aid is
provided to students to pay for it. In
the last five years, we have been able
to create a whole series of plans to
help students."
These include the California State
Scholarship program as well as
increased University aid programs.
Newman noted that the maximum
grant to a California state scholar has
risen from $1500 to its current level of
$2500.
