# Alaskan Pipeline Bill Approved By Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Nearly six
years after America's richest pool of
oil was discovered on Alaska's North
Slope, a bill authorizing a pipeline to
tap it cleared Congress yesterday.
A Senate vote of 80 to 5 sent the
measure to President Nixon. Backers
predicted he will sign it, despite
administration misgivings over sections
giving regulatory agencies greater
powers. The House passed the bill
Monday.
The $4.5-billion pipeline, long
delayed in Congress and the courts by
environmentalists who feared damage
from oil spills, would be the largest
construction job ever undertaken by
private enterprise.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
warned environmentalists that if they
again tie the project up with lawsuits,
he will offer a bill in January to have

the federal government build it.
.Jackson said work must begin by
May on the 789-mile line so that oil
can begin flowing to the ice-free port
of Valdez and thence by ship to West
Coast ports.
Reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area of
Alaska, discovered in February 1968,
are estimated at 10 billion to 30
billion barrels.
Atlantic Richfield, Exxon, British
Petroleum and four firms which hold
smaller shares of the oil formed a
consortium to build the pipeline.
After prolonged courtroom delays,
a federal appeals court blocked the
project in February. The court said it
violated limits on the width of rights
of way which Congress laid down in
1920.
Bill Provisions
The bill sent to Nixon revises the
right of way limitations, authorizes a
construction permit and bans most
lawsuits which could delay the project.
Environmentalists have 60 days in
which to challenge the
constitutionality of the bill's
prohibition of lawsuits against the
permit.
In another energy-related
development, Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz strongly opposes
gasoline rationing, saying it should be
"absolutely the last resort."
Shultz said yesterday he was
concerned that many Americans,
including some administration
officials, are overreacting to the
country's energy problems.
Rationing Necessary?
"I have seen what some
administration officials have said
about gasoline rationing," Shultz told
a conference of financial writers in
Washington. "I say to you that
rationing should be absolutely the last
resort. If we're intelligent about it, we
should be able to avoid it."
Interior Secretary Rogers C.B.
Morton said over the weekend it may
be necessary to impose gasoline
rationing within the next two or three
months.
Shultz said that to save energy, the
government should lower speed limits
and "arrest a few people when they go
over 50 miles per hour."
In Sacramento, Reagan
administration officials began pushing
yesterday for imposition of a 50
mile-an-hour speed limit in California
as part of a sweeping plan to save fuel.
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke sent
telegrams to Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, D-Van Nuys, and state Senate
President pro tem James Mills, D-San
Diego, urging them to start committee
hearings immediately on changing the
speed limit law from 65 to 50.
That would speed passage when the
legislative session resumes in January,
Reinecke said.
