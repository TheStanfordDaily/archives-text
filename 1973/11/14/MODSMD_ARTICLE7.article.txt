# Task Force Releases Report
## Student-Faculty Ties Suffer

(This is the first part of a two-part series. The
conclusion wilt appear on this page tomorrow.)
Last week, SWOPSI released a report entitled
The Other Stanford: A Report on the Relationship
of Professors and Undergraduate Students at
Stanford University, by the Student Task Force on
Education at Stanford. While the report received
considerable publicity in Campus Report, the
Stanford staff newspaper, the Daily summarized the
authors' findings only briefly. We believe the
findings of the Task Force are of considerable
significance, and deserve greater coverage and
discussion than received so far.
The conclusions of the report's authors were that
undergraduate education at Stanford is terribly
inadequate in many ways. While a majority of
students are satisfied with the intellectual
environment, the part faculty members play in their
intellectual development is minimal. From the
results of a questionnaire sent to 1600 students, the
Task Force found that most relationships between
Stanford professors and their students are shallow
and disappointing.
In the words of the authors, the "other
Stanford," meaning the teaching side rather than
the research side, "is characterized by remoteness,
distance, and impersonal relations between a
majority of students and faculty."
That "remoteness, distance, and impersonal
relations" persist in undergraduate education was
confirmed by a series of statistical findings, all of
which are significant by themselves, and all of which
lead to the same conclusion.
Students Not Satisfied
Of the 916 respondents to the questionnaire,
only 28 percent were "satisfied" or "very satisfied"
with student-faculty relations at Stanford. 77
percent disagreed with the statement "faculty try to
know me as a person," 67 percent felt that their
level of communication with faculty was
inadequate, and 61 percent said they have never felt
close to a professor.
That this dissatisfaction is accompanied by poor
social interaction patterns with professors was also
borne out by the report. 51 percent of the
respondents had never had lunch or supper with a
faculty member. Most dismal of all was the
students' perceptions of professors as advisors; 76
percent felt they got better advice from their fellow
students.
What these statistics show is that the hallowed
ideal of the University as an oasis where teachers
and students engage in frequent discussion and
debate is at best a misconception, and at worst, a
sham. But does the inferiority of student-faculty

relationships, confirmed by the report, actually
lessen the effectiveness of a Stanford undergraduate
education? Further findings in the report indicate it
does.
Never Challenges
Of the respondents to the questionnaire, 60
percent said that they had never been "challenged
by a faculty member on a one-to-one basis to really
think." 59 percent said they had never had a faculty
member extensively critique a paper or project.
Most devastating of all, 68 percent of the
respondents said that the number of professors
having a significant impact on their intellectual
development was two or less, even though a student
takes classes from 40 to 50 professors during the
course of his or her undergraduate years.
Clearly then, the remoteness of teachers to
students at Stanford does interfere with educational
quality, and does so drastically. The interpersonal
distance separating the two groups forces students
to merely be passive listeners rather than active
participants in the educational process, and forces
teachers to be mere information dispensers, talking
textbooks, rather than instigators of creative
thought.
Confirmed by nearly a thousand respondents,
this realistic picture of undergraduate education is
neither what Stanford wants nor pretends its brand
of learning to be. The public relations image
Stanford wishes to convey is that of a "community
of scholars," where teachers "catalyze critical
thinking" among their students, and students,
through thoughtful questioning and probing "keep
their teachers on their toes." As appealing as such
an image is, it contradicts reliable evidence, and thus
offends our sensibilities.
Research Rewarded
The reason for this gap between the Stanford
image and the real Stanford is a complex one that
we will deal with in a following article. Briefly,
however, we believe it stems from a reward
structure which values research more than teaching,
and places the obscure and remote researcher in
higher esteeem than the thought-provoking teacher.
That a similar reward structure with similar
harmful consequences exists at other "prestigious"
universities is hardly an acceptable rationalization of
Stanford's flaws. If Stanford is to truly be a great
institution it will have to muster the courage to
break away from the existing orthodoxies that
interfere with its real role â€” providing an effective
education.
