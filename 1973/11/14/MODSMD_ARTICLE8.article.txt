# Prevent Return To Misery Lobby
## Democrats Still Have To Fight In '76 
### 
' Ed Kohn

GREENVILLE, Miss., Nov. 7
— In the latest issue of a national
newsmagazine (no, not one of the
Big Three), Attorney
General-designate William Saxbe,
currently a Republican Senator
from Ohio, is quoted as saying: "I
get the feeling sometimes that this
administration could be the last
chance for businessmen to run the
country — and they've struck out.
It's a damned shame."
Continued Saxbe: "I'm afraid
that as a result of booting this
chance, we'll go back to the
misery lobby and the social
planners."
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Saxbe, who earlier caused a
few ripples with his comments on
President Nixon's seeming lack of
sanity, appears to have hit another
nail squarely on the head. But the
only problem is that members of
the opposite party aren't listening
to his pounding — or they don't
care.
Elections Overlooked
The Democrats right now are
so concerned with impeachment
(which is a perfectly timely and
legitimate concern) that they are
forgetting that congressional
elections arc coming up in exactly
one year. A presidential election
looms only three years hence.
And, as the Democrats should
have learned last year, it's damned
hard to win an election — whether
it be for dogcatcher or President
— without a coherent ideology
and without thoughtful,
well-developed programs and
policies. A good on-camera
appearance helps, but by itself it's
just not enough.
The Democrats seem insistent,
at least for the moment, on
concentrating on immediate
political problems and on ignoring
more long-range philosophical
questions that, unless resolved,
could make Spiro Agnew himself
a shoo-in in 1976.
Major Issues
Consider briefly some of the
major issues that national
Democrats will have to face as
early as next year:
The Economy: Who besides
the federal government's Office of
Management and Budget has
begun serious planning for 1976
through 1980 and beyond? (Such
plans usually take about five years
to develop.) The current

administration's economic policies
have proven to be disastrous in
many instances; with what
policies should they be replaced?
The Defense Department: In
what direction is America's
defense to be oriented during the
coming decades? Which programs
are worthy of support? What role
should the Department of Defense
play in our society?
Pocketbook Diplomacy?
Foreign Affairs: Is the policy
of detente the best (and most
honest) one available? How
closely is the United States going
to follow pocketbook diplomacy?
Race and Equality: Are we
ever going to come to grips with
the problems that may destroy us
— or will we continue to run
around in circles, becoming
increasingly dependent on an
unwilling U.S. Supreme Court for
social guidance?
The Cities: The current
administration believes that "law
and order," administered in
massive doses, is the answer to
many of the problems confronting
urban dwellers. Is it the best
answer? Is the quality of life in
the cities improving, or do the
cities represent a doomed culture?
Natural Resources: For years,
Americans have refused to believe
that energy sources might run out
or be severely limited. What
national policies need to be
developed to deal with oil,
gasoline, natural gas, water,
timber, clean air and other
shortages? Are we to live from
one brownout to the next?
Federal Power
The Federal Government: Are
we going to allow the federal
government to become ever more
omnipotent over our lives? Can
we continue to tolerate many of
the government practices, such as
secrecy, deceit and obstruction of
justice that characterize the
current administration?
The Democratic party has been
cruising along now for years
paying lip-service to a New
Deal-era alliance with labor,
minorities, the poor, academics,
the industrial Northeast and the
South (remember the "Solid
South"? — it's solid again .. .
solid Republican, at least as far as
national candidates are
concerned).
But the last two presidential
elections showed fairly

conclusively that those old
political equations just don't work
any more. (There are a number of
reasons for this that are especially
visible in the South, including the
gradual realignment of voters and
the complete lack of leadership
and organization of the national
Democratic party.)
Republicans Conform Better
The Republicans understand
these changing tides, and are
moving to conform with them, far
better than do the Democrats — at
least the Democrats portrayed as
"leaders."
The Republicans; who
expressed a somewhat coherent
ideology prior to the 1968
elections, have a tendency to
sacrifice their principles (like
many businessmen) in the name
of practical or expedient politics.
But at least the GOP recently had
an ideology to display, to use as a
touchstone. The Democrats can't
even say that much, viz. Sen.
McGovern's flip-flops last year on
questions concerning the
economy.
If the Democrats are serious
about their chances for 1976,
they've got to begin grapping
seriously with philosophical
problems and long-range issues.
No Mood For Rhetoric
As the public's reaction ot the
current Watergate disclosures
clearly shows, the people are in no
mood to tolerate meaningless
rhetoric or, in the language of
Washington, bafflegab. And as
congressional Republicans are
learning, they're certainly not in

the mood to tolerate another
campaign full of promises like
"peace with honor," "now more
than ever," and "four more
years."
But unless the Democrats begin
to formulate policies that will be
meaningful and acceptable to the
American people, there is an
excellent chance — despite
Watergate and regardless of
whether or not the President is
impeached — that the misery
lobby (all those poor Republicans
lobbying for their favorite
programs) and the social planners
(like John "Law and Order"
Mitchell) may well enjoy "four
more years."

planners."
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Saxbe, who earlier caused a
few ripples with his comments on
President Nixon's seeming lack of
sanity, appears to have hit another
nail squarely on the head. But the
only problem is that members of
the opposite party aren't listening
to his pounding — or they don't
care.
Elections Overlooked
The Democrats right now are
so concerned with impeachment
(which is a perfectly timely and
legitimate concern) that they are
forgetting that congressional
elections arc coming up in exactly
one year. A presidential election
looms only three years hence.
And, as the Democrats should
have learned last year, it's damned
hard to win an election — whether
it be for dogcatcher or President
— without a coherent ideology
and without thoughtful,
well-developed programs and
policies. A good on-camera
appearance helps, but by itself it's
just not enough.
The Democrats seem insistent,
at least for the moment, on
concentrating on immediate
political problems and on ignoring
more long-range philosophical
questions that, unless resolved,
could make Spiro Agnew himself
a shoo-in in 1976.
Major Issues
Consider briefly some of the
major issues that national
Democrats will have to face as
early as next year:
The Economy: Who besides
the federal government's Office of
Management and Budget has
begun serious planning for 1976
through 1980 and beyond? (Such
plans usually take about five years
to develop.) The current

administration's economic policies
have proven to be disastrous in
many instances; with what
policies should they be replaced?
The Defense Department: In
what direction is America's
defense to be oriented during the
coming decades? Which programs
are worthy of support? What role
should the Department of Defense
play in our society?
Pocketbook Diplomacy?
Foreign Affairs: Is the policy
of detente the best (and most
honest) one available? How
closely is the United States going
to follow pocketbook diplomacy?
Race and Equality: Are we
ever going to come to grips with
the problems that may destroy us
— or will we continue to run
around in circles, becoming
increasingly dependent on an
unwilling U.S. Supreme Court for
social guidance?
The Cities: The current
administration believes that "law
and order," administered in
massive doses, is the answer to
many of the problems confronting
urban dwellers. Is it the best
answer? Is the quality of life in
the cities improving, or do the
cities represent a doomed culture?
Natural Resources: For years,
Americans have refused to believe
that energy sources might run out
or be severely limited. What
national policies need to be
developed to deal with oil,
gasoline, natural gas, water,
timber, clean air and other
shortages? Are we to live from
one brownout to the next?
Federal Power
The Federal Government: Are
we going to allow the federal
government to become ever more
omnipotent over our lives? Can
we continue to tolerate many of
the government practices, such as
secrecy, deceit and obstruction of
justice that characterize the
current administration?
The Democratic party has been
cruising along now for years
paying lip-service to a New
Deal-era alliance with labor,
minorities, the poor, academics,
the industrial Northeast and the
South (remember the "Solid
South"? — it's solid again .. .
solid Republican, at least as far as
national candidates are
concerned).
But the last two presidential
elections showed fairly

conclusively that those old
political equations just don't work
any more. (There are a number of
reasons for this that are especially
visible in the South, including the
gradual realignment of voters and
the complete lack of leadership
and organization of the national
Democratic party.)
Republicans Conform Better
The Republicans understand
these changing tides, and are
moving to conform with them, far
better than do the Democrats — at
least the Democrats portrayed as
"leaders."
The Republicans; who
expressed a somewhat coherent
ideology prior to the 1968
elections, have a tendency to
sacrifice their principles (like
many businessmen) in the name
of practical or expedient politics.
But at least the GOP recently had
an ideology to display, to use as a
touchstone. The Democrats can't
even say that much, viz. Sen.
McGovern's flip-flops last year on
questions concerning the
economy.
If the Democrats are serious
about their chances for 1976,
they've got to begin grapping
seriously with philosophical
problems and long-range issues.
No Mood For Rhetoric
As the public's reaction ot the
current Watergate disclosures
clearly shows, the people are in no
mood to tolerate meaningless
rhetoric or, in the language of
Washington, bafflegab. And as
congressional Republicans are
learning, they're certainly not in

the mood to tolerate another
campaign full of promises like
"peace with honor," "now more
than ever," and "four more
years."
But unless the Democrats begin
to formulate policies that will be
meaningful and acceptable to the
American people, there is an
excellent chance — despite
Watergate and regardless of
whether or not the President is
impeached — that the misery
lobby (all those poor Republicans
lobbying for their favorite
programs) and the social planners
(like John "Law and Order"
Mitchell) may well enjoy "four
more years."

have learned last year, it's damned
hard to win an election — whether
it be for dogcatcher or President
— without a coherent ideology
and without thoughtful,
well-developed programs and
policies. A good on-camera
appearance helps, but by itself it's
just not enough.
The Democrats seem insistent,
at least for the moment, on
concentrating on immediate
political problems and on ignoring
more long-range philosophical
questions that, unless resolved,
could make Spiro Agnew himself
a shoo-in in 1976.
Major Issues
Consider briefly some of the
major issues that national
Democrats will have to face as
early as next year:
The Economy: Who besides
the federal government's Office of
Management and Budget has
begun serious planning for 1976
through 1980 and beyond? (Such
plans usually take about five years
to develop.) The current

administration's economic policies
have proven to be disastrous in
many instances; with what
policies should they be replaced?
The Defense Department: In
what direction is America's
defense to be oriented during the
coming decades? Which programs
are worthy of support? What role
should the Department of Defense
play in our society?
Pocketbook Diplomacy?
Foreign Affairs: Is the policy
of detente the best (and most
honest) one available? How
closely is the United States going
to follow pocketbook diplomacy?
Race and Equality: Are we
ever going to come to grips with
the problems that may destroy us
— or will we continue to run
around in circles, becoming
increasingly dependent on an
unwilling U.S. Supreme Court for
social guidance?
The Cities: The current
administration believes that "law
and order," administered in
massive doses, is the answer to
many of the problems confronting
urban dwellers. Is it the best
answer? Is the quality of life in
the cities improving, or do the
cities represent a doomed culture?
Natural Resources: For years,
Americans have refused to believe
that energy sources might run out
or be severely limited. What
national policies need to be
developed to deal with oil,
gasoline, natural gas, water,
timber, clean air and other
shortages? Are we to live from
one brownout to the next?
Federal Power
The Federal Government: Are
we going to allow the federal
government to become ever more
omnipotent over our lives? Can
we continue to tolerate many of
the government practices, such as
secrecy, deceit and obstruction of
justice that characterize the
current administration?
The Democratic party has been
cruising along now for years
paying lip-service to a New
Deal-era alliance with labor,
minorities, the poor, academics,
the industrial Northeast and the
South (remember the "Solid
South"? — it's solid again .. .
solid Republican, at least as far as
national candidates are
concerned).
But the last two presidential
elections showed fairly

conclusively that those old
political equations just don't work
any more. (There are a number of
reasons for this that are especially
visible in the South, including the
gradual realignment of voters and
the complete lack of leadership
and organization of the national
Democratic party.)
Republicans Conform Better
The Republicans understand
these changing tides, and are
moving to conform with them, far
better than do the Democrats — at
least the Democrats portrayed as
"leaders."
The Republicans; who
expressed a somewhat coherent
ideology prior to the 1968
elections, have a tendency to
sacrifice their principles (like
many businessmen) in the name
of practical or expedient politics.
But at least the GOP recently had
an ideology to display, to use as a
touchstone. The Democrats can't
even say that much, viz. Sen.
McGovern's flip-flops last year on
questions concerning the
economy.
If the Democrats are serious
about their chances for 1976,
they've got to begin grapping
seriously with philosophical
problems and long-range issues.
No Mood For Rhetoric
As the public's reaction ot the
current Watergate disclosures
clearly shows, the people are in no
mood to tolerate meaningless
rhetoric or, in the language of
Washington, bafflegab. And as
congressional Republicans are
learning, they're certainly not in

the mood to tolerate another
campaign full of promises like
"peace with honor," "now more
than ever," and "four more
years."
But unless the Democrats begin
to formulate policies that will be
meaningful and acceptable to the
American people, there is an
excellent chance — despite
Watergate and regardless of
whether or not the President is
impeached — that the misery
lobby (all those poor Republicans
lobbying for their favorite
programs) and the social planners
(like John "Law and Order"
Mitchell) may well enjoy "four
more years."

GREENVILLE, Miss., Nov. 7
— In the latest issue of a national
newsmagazine (no, not one of the
Big Three), Attorney
General-designate William Saxbe,
currently a Republican Senator
from Ohio, is quoted as saying: "I
get the feeling sometimes that this
administration could be the last
chance for businessmen to run the
country — and they've struck out.
It's a damned shame."
Continued Saxbe: "I'm afraid
that as a result of booting this
chance, we'll go back to the
misery lobby and the social
planners."
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Saxbe, who earlier caused a
few ripples with his comments on
President Nixon's seeming lack of
sanity, appears to have hit another
nail squarely on the head. But the
only problem is that members of
the opposite party aren't listening
to his pounding — or they don't
care.
Elections Overlooked
The Democrats right now are
so concerned with impeachment
(which is a perfectly timely and
legitimate concern) that they are
forgetting that congressional
elections arc coming up in exactly
one year. A presidential election
looms only three years hence.
And, as the Democrats should
