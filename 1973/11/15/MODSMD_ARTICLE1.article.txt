# Cox Firing Ruled Illegal By U.S. District Judge
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal
judge ruled yesterday that the firing of
Watergate special prosecutor Archibald
Cox was illegal.
The decision led to immediate calls
that Cox return to his office, but he
indicated he will not. "For me to
make any legal claims under Judge
Gesell's decision would only divert
attention from getting the job done,"
Cox said.
A congressman who sought the
ruling from U.S. District Court Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell said the decision

makes the possibility of impeaching
President Nixon substantially more
likely.
Cox was fired at Nixon's order by
Acting Atty. Gen. Robert H. Bork in
an action that led to the departures of
two top Justice Department officials
and a preliminary move in the House
of Representatives to impeach Nixon.
Texas lawyer Leon Jaworski later
was appointed as the new special
prosecutor.
"The important thing is that the
investigation and any resulting

prosecutions be vigorously pressed by
Mr. Leon Jaworski, or any special
prosecutor named under new
legislation, and the present very
capable staff," Cox said in a telephone
interview.
No Comment From Bork
The White House referred all
comment on Gesell's decision to the
Justice Department. Bork said he will
have nothing to say until he reads it,
then will "try to do what is called for
under the circumstances."
"Mr. Cox served subject to
congressional rather than presidential
control," Gesell ruled.
Gesell, responding to a suit by three
Democratic congressmen, had earlier
rejected requests for injunctions which
would have permitted Cox's return.
Gesell based his ruling on the
regulations which established Cox's
office, noting they were nearly
identical to the regulations protecting
his successor.
'For Jaworski's Sake'
For Jaworski's sake, "it is therefore
particularly desirable to enunciate the
rule of law applicable if attempts are
made to discharge him," said Gesell.
But while Gesell upheld the
members of Congress on their suit, he
criticized any attempt to guarantee the
independence of the prosecutor by
creating a new one subject to
appointment and supervision of the
courts.
"The courts must remain neutral.
Their duties are not prosecutorial,"
said Gesell.
