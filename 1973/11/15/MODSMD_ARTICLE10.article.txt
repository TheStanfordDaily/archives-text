## Chile: Mismanagement Under Allende 
### 
(This is the first half of a two-part
series. The conclusion will appear
tomorrow on this page.)
Since September 11, we have
been exposed to a barrage of
demonstrations, teach-ins, articles
in the Daily, etc., concerning the
situation in Chile. With a single
exception they condemn the
coup, deplore the loss of
democracy in our country, praise
the activities of Allende and his
followers, and lay the blame for
the attitudes and actions of the
Chilean people against their late
government at the feet of the CIA
and the U.S. State Department.
Explanations of this sort are at
best foolish and uninformed if not
devious in nature.
It takes a long time to know a
country and to fully understand

what is really going on. Some of
our local "authorities" on Chile
that have been interpreting
"reality" for us are summer
vacation "experts." Two months
in Chile and they have all the
answers, without even trying to
understand the questions.
There is more to Chile than the
CIA, fascists, and John
Wayne-stereotypes of good guys
and bad guys. Let us look at some
facts:
1. Allende was elected with a
plurality of only 36 percent in
September 1970. In April 1971,
he received nearly half the vote.
Last March he received 44
percent, with a pending
congressional probe of an alleged
election fraud, engineered by
Allende's government, and
estimated at 5 percent of the
votes. This shows that the
majority in Chile had always
opposed Allende.
Moreover, for a move as drastic
as the peaceful conversion of a
democratic society into a
"socialist" one, it is both ethically
and politically imperative to have
overwhelming popular support.
Allende never had this support
nor did he care about it. His
insensitivity to majority opinion is
manifestly apparent. He was not
interested in democracy.
2. Under Allende, Chile led the
world in rate of inflation, no less
than 320 percent in the
twelve-month period ending
August 1973. Acute shortages of
basic goods, most significantly
food, were a fact of life. All night
lines were formed to buy a single
quart of cooking oil or two
pounds of sugar. Standing in line
became a "professional" activity.
Full scale black markets
flourished with prices ranging as
high as ten times the official rates
and more. Corrupt government
officials participated in the black
market by dealing in merchandise
they had illegally obtained from
factories under their control. All
this was unlike anything ever
before experienced in Chile.
3. Illegal and/or forceful
seizure of some 400 major
industrial companies as well as
hundreds of small and medium
sized farms was accomplished
with no compensation to the
owners. Industrial production
dropped by 10 percent in the past
twelve months and agricultural
production was down by 20
percent. Food imports rose form
$160 million in 1970 to $600
million in 1973. The GNP
dropped 10 percent last year.
The 400 companies seized
formed the so called "social area"
of the economy. Under the

control of new government
supervisors they ran a deficit of
$1 billion in 1973 (this, in a
country whose GNP is $6 billion.)
How could those companies
continue to operate? Simple: the
government printed money for
them, as much as they needed.
The total amount of money in the
economy increased 23 times in
three years. Small wonder that the
rate of inflation was 320 percent.
The fiscal deficit was 53 percent
this year, which means that out of

$100 of government expenditures
$47 came from taxes and other
revenues and $53 were supplied
by the printing press.
All this was. in the name of
workers welfare. However
workers' share in wages and
salaries actually decreased during
Allendes tenure.
