Native American Clarification
Editor:
In regard to the recent article
by Jon Daunt, "Anthropologists
Ignore Indian Culture," I would
like to clarify two points:
First, Daunt implies that the
current Stanford anthropology
course on Native Americans
avoids contemporary problems
faced by these people. However,
as a student in the course, I have
found it to thoroughly
incorporate aspects of modern
social, health, and economic
problems of American Indians, in
conjunction with traditional
ethnographic material.
Second, Daunt questions the
utility of anthropological studies
in terms of aiding Native
Americans. He documents how
many government programs
designed to help the Indians have
only worsened their condition of
life. Daunt has failed to note that
one reason why these programs
failed is that they lack
specialization to the cultures of
Native Americans. Furthermore,
even a "successful" program
which improves Indian health and
economics can further their
cultural disintegration, if not
modified and adapted to the
particular way of life.
Anthropologists do not ignore
Indian cultures; unfortunately,
the government has ignored
anthropologists. Native Americans
need the financial aid of the
American government for health,
education, and economic
assistance, but to make this aid
effective, they also need
understanding. That is why,
through his insight and analysis, in

applications and in academics, the
anthropologist is a friend of
Native Americans.

Philly Fans Never Die!
Editor:
I take the utmost exception to
Don Tollefson and his Pro
Prognosis (Daily, Nov. 7). His
statement, "Oakland deserves two
world champions about as much
as Philadelphia. .displays a
gross delusion.
The fact is, no city deserves
two winners as much as
Philadelphia. Its fans are the best
in America: from the 1.5 million
who paid to see the Phillies finish
last each of the last three
summers, to the loyal Eagle fans
who formed a waiting list for
season tickets hundreds of places
long, to the Flyer fans who sell
out every home game. Even a new
team, the North American Soccer
League Atoms, set a league
attendance record in their first
season (while winning the
Championship, something no
other expansion team has ever
done in its first year).
Madison Square Garden
notwithstanding, the noisiest
crowd in basketball is at the
Palestra, the University of
Pennsylvania arena and home of
the Big Five (Penn, Villanova,
Temple, St. Joe, and LaSalle).
Where else do the fans provide
standing ovations for every single
basket scored by their team?
Philadelphia has one champion
this year in the Atoms. Its chances
for a second rest with the Eagles
and their dazzling new offense
(they are IV2 games out of first
place), and the Flyers with MVP
and much-loved Bobby Clarke
(they are in first place). Should
they lose the Philly fans will gripe
as usual, but they will all be back
next year with more sellout, and
vocal, crowds.

Tuition vs. Financial Aid
Editor:
It's easy to follow the
Administration's explanation for
the latest tuition increase
proposal, but its hard to accept its
logic, because Ray Bacchetti's
reasoning as reported in the Nov.
6 Daily describes a neat circle.
Higher tuition and fees are
required to fund increased costs,
of which "the highest expenditure
priority" is financial aid, "which
we augment each year to keep up
with the increased cost of
attending Stanford" due to higher
tuition and fees. Obviously the
Administration is not being
candid with us.
