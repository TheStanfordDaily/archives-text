# 'First Step Toward Peace'
## Israeli Arab Backs Truce 
### DAN COX 
Nawaf Massalha, an Israeli
Arab, said Tuesday night that the
recent Israeli-Arab truce was a
"first step toward peace" and
"continuation of the Mideast war
would have soon brought
intervention by the USSR and
then the U.S."
Massalha, director of the
Young Arab Workers Division of
the Histadrut (Israel's national
labor organization), speaking to
50 people in a Tresidder meeting
room added, "We don't need a
second Vietnam in the Middle
East."
The Israel born Arab,
instrumental in the early
development of a youth
movement and currently running
for parliament in Israel, criticized
the great powers for their delay in
working to bring peace to the
Mideast.

The great powers "have a lot of
influence to bring about peace.
They could just have done this
before the war, not just after,"
Massalha said. He went on to note
that "European states have no
influence any more in the middle
East to use to bring peace. The
Middle East has the influence in
Europe now because of the oil
shortage."
Massalha emphasized, "I
believe Israel needs to and must
live. She must become a member
of the international society.
"Hard, long negotiations will
bring permanent peace to the
Mideast after this long war.
Because both sides can bomb the
other's capital, no borders are
secure. But we must not be afraid
of peace," he said.
"A bad peace is better than a
good war. There is no good war,"
he said.

A key issue in the Mideast
settlement is the disposition of
the Palestinian refugees. "The
Palestinians must take part in the
negotiations," Massalha said. "If
the Palestinian people can
recognize Israel and the two can
negotiate their problems, then
why not the establishment of an
autonomous Palestinian state?" he
added.
"I believe after the war
everybody will claim victory. The
Arabs can say they crossed the
canal, that they destroyed Israel's
big defense line and that Arabs are
good fighters. Nobody lost this
war. No army was lost. We did
lose some of the best Jewish and
Arab youth," he concluded.
Massalha's appearance was
co-sponsored by Stanford Hillel,
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau, and
the Youth Committee for Peace
and Democracy in the Middle
East.
