# 'Patience' Provides Pizazz
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
The Stanford Savoyards gave
four perfectly splendid
performances of Gilbert and
Sullivan's little-known comic
opera Patience at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last weekend. If you
missed them, too bad. You missed
a real treat.
A "unique blend of students,
faculty, staff, and friends of
Stanford," the Savoyards have
mounted entertaining G &S
productions for several seasons,
with lolanthe scheduled for a run
spring quarter.
Replete with orchestra and
professional costumes (some of
the latter courtesy of the San
Francisco Lamplighters), the
Savoyards delivered a Patience
which made up in pizazz whatever
it may have lacked in really
elegant singing and acting.
A newspaper review is scarcely
the place to recapitulate Gilbert's
hilarious plot for Patience. Suffice
it to say that Patience, a winsome
dairy maid, is wooed by both
sinister Reginard Bunthorne and
her childhood sweetheart,
Archibald Grosvenor, both
nauseatingly fey poets.
Nonsense
In the course of this nonsense,
Patience delivers a few low blows
to late nineteenth-century
Aestheticism, immortalized in the
verse of Swinburne, Dante, Gabriel
Rossetti's paintings and the
witticisms of that fop
extraordinaire, Oscar Wilde.
Bunthorne and Grosvenor,
both mincing, affected travesties
of such Pre-Raphaelite esthetes,
are continuously surrounded by a
feminine following blind to such
foolishness.
Dan Robinson led competent
instrumentalists through a slightly
nerveless but generally
satisfactory Overture (probably
pieced together by Sullivan at the
last moment), and the curtain rose
on an attractively costumed bevy
of beauties. First-act jitters
disappeared after our hero and
heroine made their entrances, and
the audience began to enjoy itself.
The second act was better yet.
Several songs brought thunderous
applause, and one a
thoroughly-deserved encore.
Sweetly Cynical
From the opening chorus to
the second act finale, Judith
Malafronte's sweetly cynical Lady
Angela featured clear if a trifle
hesitant singing. Leigh Jones as
Lady Saphir and Janet Helman's
Lady Ella were also successful.
George Ecker, as Reginald
Bunthorne, was marvellous. His
strong, suitable character acting
more than offset any lack of vocal
ability, and his stormy poetry
readings were delightfully
decadent. Benjamin Brink and
Peter Martin, ramrod-stiff
Dragoon guards, delivered their
rather limited parts and patter
songs with verve.
A special accolade to Ladislau
Berla's Duke of Dunstable. Berla,
a freshman, will doubtlessly
become a fixture in future
Savoyard performances; his
forceful tenor carried several
scenes.
Ella Asbury's Lady Jane and
Scott Phillips' perfect Archibald
Grosvenor stood out as perhaps

the evening's finest
characterizations. Lady Jane is a
typical G & S contralto — fat and
falling to pieces.
Her second-act solo a la cello
was superb, and her "pooh-pooh"
duet with Bunthorne brought
down the house in gales of
laughter. Scott Phillips, dressed to
perfection apple-green knickers
and ruffled jacket, flounced his
way through several nice songs
and scenes, despite a rough and
untrained voice.
Rustic Ingenue
Last but not least: our pretty
Patience, Patty Wolfe. Portraying
this rustic ingenue requires
tasteful acting, solid singing, and a

cuddlesome figure: Wolfe has
them all, though her high notes
did wobble a bit. Her answers to
Bunthorne's sophisticated wooing
were charmingly coy: »
He (sardonic, passionate):
"And what do you yearn for?"
She (wide-eyed and dewey): "I
yearn my living."
Alternates for the roles of
Colonel Calverley, Major
Murgatroyd, Lady Angela, and
Patience on Thursday and
Saturday nights were Daniel
Evans, Dann Allan Gail
Anderson, and Elizabeth Barbour.
Mason Blacher was the producer,
and Phyllis E. Villeneuve provided
dramatic direction.

the new National General Pictures Film, "Executive Action." The film sports the theory that the
assassination was in reality a conspiracy, Lee Harvey Oswald having been framed by a group of right-wing

pieced together by Sullivan at the
last moment), and the curtain rose
on an attractively costumed bevy
of beauties. First-act jitters
disappeared after our hero and
heroine made their entrances, and
the audience began to enjoy itself.
The second act was better yet.
Several songs brought thunderous
applause, and one a
thoroughly-deserved encore.
Sweetly Cynical
From the opening chorus to
the second act finale, Judith
Malafronte's sweetly cynical Lady
Angela featured clear if a trifle
hesitant singing. Leigh Jones as
Lady Saphir and Janet Helman's
Lady Ella were also successful.
George Ecker, as Reginald
Bunthorne, was marvellous. His
strong, suitable character acting
more than offset any lack of vocal
ability, and his stormy poetry
readings were delightfully
decadent. Benjamin Brink and
Peter Martin, ramrod-stiff
Dragoon guards, delivered their
rather limited parts and patter
songs with verve.
A special accolade to Ladislau
Berla's Duke of Dunstable. Berla,
a freshman, will doubtlessly
become a fixture in future
Savoyard performances; his
forceful tenor carried several
scenes.
Ella Asbury's Lady Jane and
Scott Phillips' perfect Archibald
Grosvenor stood out as perhaps

the evening's finest
characterizations. Lady Jane is a
typical G & S contralto — fat and
falling to pieces.
Her second-act solo a la cello
was superb, and her "pooh-pooh"
duet with Bunthorne brought
down the house in gales of
laughter. Scott Phillips, dressed to
perfection apple-green knickers
and ruffled jacket, flounced his
way through several nice songs
and scenes, despite a rough and
untrained voice.
Rustic Ingenue
Last but not least: our pretty
Patience, Patty Wolfe. Portraying
this rustic ingenue requires
tasteful acting, solid singing, and a

cuddlesome figure: Wolfe has
them all, though her high notes
did wobble a bit. Her answers to
Bunthorne's sophisticated wooing
were charmingly coy: »
He (sardonic, passionate):
"And what do you yearn for?"
She (wide-eyed and dewey): "I
yearn my living."
Alternates for the roles of
Colonel Calverley, Major
Murgatroyd, Lady Angela, and
Patience on Thursday and
Saturday nights were Daniel
Evans, Dann Allan Gail
Anderson, and Elizabeth Barbour.
Mason Blacher was the producer,
and Phyllis E. Villeneuve provided
dramatic direction.

THE WORD IS KlLL—Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan plan the assassination of President Kennedy in
the new National General Pictures Film, "Executive Action." The film sports the theory that the
assassination was in reality a conspiracy, Lee Harvey Oswald having been framed by a group of right-wing
millionaires.
The Stanford Savoyards gave
four perfectly splendid
performances of Gilbert and
Sullivan's little-known comic
opera Patience at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last weekend. If you
missed them, too bad. You missed
a real treat.
A "unique blend of students,
faculty, staff, and friends of
Stanford," the Savoyards have
mounted entertaining G &S
productions for several seasons,
with lolanthe scheduled for a run
spring quarter.
Replete with orchestra and
professional costumes (some of
the latter courtesy of the San
Francisco Lamplighters), the
Savoyards delivered a Patience
which made up in pizazz whatever
it may have lacked in really
elegant singing and acting.
A newspaper review is scarcely
the place to recapitulate Gilbert's
hilarious plot for Patience. Suffice
it to say that Patience, a winsome
dairy maid, is wooed by both
sinister Reginard Bunthorne and
her childhood sweetheart,
Archibald Grosvenor, both
nauseatingly fey poets.
Nonsense
In the course of this nonsense,
Patience delivers a few low blows
to late nineteenth-century
Aestheticism, immortalized in the
verse of Swinburne, Dante, Gabriel
Rossetti's paintings and the
witticisms of that fop
extraordinaire, Oscar Wilde.
Bunthorne and Grosvenor,
both mincing, affected travesties
of such Pre-Raphaelite esthetes,
are continuously surrounded by a
feminine following blind to such
foolishness.
Dan Robinson led competent
instrumentalists through a slightly
nerveless but generally
satisfactory Overture (probably
pieced together by Sullivan at the
last moment), and the curtain rose
on an attractively costumed bevy
of beauties. First-act jitters
disappeared after our hero and
