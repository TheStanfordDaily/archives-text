# 'Traviata' Rescued Despite Problems
## 
### KENNETH deLONG 
Every season it is the destiny
of at least one opera to be
"controversial." This year it is
Verdi's La Traviata. Featuring
Beverly Sills in the title role, the
San Francisco Opera's general
director Kurt Herbert Adler in the
pit, and the celebrated Tito
Capobianco as stage director, La
Traviata opened Friday last to
devastating review by the local
press.
Why? The answer lies, at least
in part, in those quirks of fate
which are the lot of the
performing arts. The tenor lost his
voice momentarily during the
second act cabaletta, and the
baritone destroyed the second act
by singing flagrantly flat through
both his aria and the duet with
Sills.
This reviewer had the
opportunity of hearing the
broadcast of opening night, and of
seeing the second performance.
Between Friday and the next
Wednesday the offending
members were purged. The
cabaletta was cut, and the
baritone replaced The controversy
thus remains: Can these last
minute changes rescue this
season's La Traviatal In my
opinion, the answer is "Yes," but
with at least one qualification.
Stunning Sills
Beverly Sills continued her line
of San Francisco Opera triumphs
with a really stunning
performance as the consumptive
heroine Violetta. As Violetta, Sills
completely dominated the stage
visually and vocally. Her voice is
ideal for the part, possessing not

only great agility, but great
beauty of tone as well.
As an actress, Sills is amazingly
versatile, and particularly
successful as that tender and
fragile type of heroine dear to the
nineteenth century sensibility.
Wieslaw Ochman, who sang the
role of Alfredo, Violetta's lover,
gave a thoroughly creditable
performance. He is a true lyric
tenor with an excellent top
register; unfortunately his voice,
although pleasant, is not
particularly memorable, and was
vocally outshone by Sills.
Tense Moment
The really tense moment of the
evening came at the beginning of
the second act with the entrance
of baritone Guillermo Sarabia.
Who was this baritone brought in
to replace the ailing Mostromei?
Could he step in at the last
moment and bring off this
important vocally demanding

role? For the audience, the answer
was a resounding "Yes!",
expressed by the terrific round of
applause given him at the closing
curtain.
Sarabia has a strong well-placed
voice, and (especially after
Friday's disaster) he sang
flawlessly in tune.
The most difficult aspect of
the performance to assess was the
conducting. Adler is a fine general
director and responsible for much
of the recent growth in stature of
the Opera. As a conductor,
however, I had certain
reservations. Too often I found
myself leaning forward in my seat
to see what was happening in the
pit.
Adler's highly disciplined
approach produced fine and
sensitive reading of many
orchestral passages, especially the
overtures to the first and final
acts, but it was also the cause of

some curiously mannered
accompaniments to the arias.
Italian opera of this type is
singers' opera, and a conductor
who draws attention to himself is
not serving the best interests of
the score.
Despite the rocky first
performance, this year's La
Trauiata (in its re-touched version)
is well worth a trip to the city, if
only to hear and see the great
Beverly Sills do her operatic thing.

opinion, the answer is "Yes," but
with at least one qualification.
Stunning Sills
Beverly Sills continued her line
of San Francisco Opera triumphs
with a really stunning
performance as the consumptive
heroine Violetta. As Violetta, Sills
completely dominated the stage
visually and vocally. Her voice is
ideal for the part, possessing not

only great agility, but great
beauty of tone as well.
As an actress, Sills is amazingly
versatile, and particularly
successful as that tender and
fragile type of heroine dear to the
nineteenth century sensibility.
Wieslaw Ochman, who sang the
role of Alfredo, Violetta's lover,
gave a thoroughly creditable
performance. He is a true lyric
tenor with an excellent top
register; unfortunately his voice,
although pleasant, is not
particularly memorable, and was
vocally outshone by Sills.
Tense Moment
The really tense moment of the
evening came at the beginning of
the second act with the entrance
of baritone Guillermo Sarabia.
Who was this baritone brought in
to replace the ailing Mostromei?
Could he step in at the last
moment and bring off this
important vocally demanding

role? For the audience, the answer
was a resounding "Yes!",
expressed by the terrific round of
applause given him at the closing
curtain.
Sarabia has a strong well-placed
voice, and (especially after
Friday's disaster) he sang
flawlessly in tune.
The most difficult aspect of
the performance to assess was the
conducting. Adler is a fine general
director and responsible for much
of the recent growth in stature of
the Opera. As a conductor,
however, I had certain
reservations. Too often I found
myself leaning forward in my seat
to see what was happening in the
pit.
Adler's highly disciplined
approach produced fine and
sensitive reading of many
orchestral passages, especially the
overtures to the first and final
acts, but it was also the cause of

some curiously mannered
accompaniments to the arias.
Italian opera of this type is
singers' opera, and a conductor
who draws attention to himself is
not serving the best interests of
the score.
Despite the rocky first
performance, this year's La
Trauiata (in its re-touched version)
is well worth a trip to the city, if
only to hear and see the great
Beverly Sills do her operatic thing.
Every season it is the destiny
of at least one opera to be
"controversial." This year it is
Verdi's La Traviata. Featuring
Beverly Sills in the title role, the
San Francisco Opera's general
director Kurt Herbert Adler in the
pit, and the celebrated Tito
Capobianco as stage director, La
Traviata opened Friday last to
devastating review by the local
press.
Why? The answer lies, at least
in part, in those quirks of fate
which are the lot of the
performing arts. The tenor lost his
voice momentarily during the
second act cabaletta, and the
baritone destroyed the second act
by singing flagrantly flat through
both his aria and the duet with
Sills.
