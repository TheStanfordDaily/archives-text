# 'Executive Action'
## Film Assassinates Itself 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Just a little over 10 years ago,
someone gunned down President
John F. Kennedy in Dallas and
provided America with the
greatest murder mystery of the
century.
Countless books have been
written in an attempt to prove
that Lee Harvey Oswald, the man
the Warren Commission pinned
with the assassin's tag, either didn't
do it or had a great deal of help.
It's been some time now since
the evening news reports were full
of talk about the "one bullet
theory" or "the puff of smoke on
the grassy knoll" or "the doctored
photograph." But you can expect
to hear those phrases kicked
about quite a bit in the month to
come, because a new movie has
dredged up the issue again.
It's Executive Action, written
by Dalton Trumbo (Johnny Got
His Gun, Spartacus) and based on
a novel by Master Conspirator
Theorists Donald Freed and Mark
Lane. And if you're thinking of
investing $3 to see if it solves the
mystery, forget it.
Terrible
Not only does it fail to shed
new light on the assassination, it's
a terrible movie.
Trumbo reportedly got
$250,000 for the screenplay, and
if Executive Action's screenplay
was worth that much, then the
review you're reading deserves a
cool million. Trumbo's dialog is
wooden — which matches quite
nicely with the expressions of
most of the actors — and the
entire movie sounds like one side
of a debate. Characters in
Executive Action don't talk so
much as they lecture.
What they say isn't particularly

well-phrased. Right-wing fanatics,
for instance, did not use the word
"black" in 1963. In those days it
was still "nigger."
The acting is worse, which is
saying quite a bit. Burt Lancaster,
as a right-wing millionaire
managing the assassination
attempt, brings such a
blockheaded intensity to the role
that it looks like he did the whole
movie with a hangover. Every
once in a while he starts to wake
up, hears one of his own lines, and
goes back under.
Worse
Robert Ryan, as another
member of the millionaire cabal,
looks resigned to the whole mess.
Perhaps he was; he died two days
after the movie was finished. It's
unfortunate that such a fine actor
had to end his career in such a
terrible movie.
The theory the film advances is
at least as muddled as the acting.
Briefly, it centers around a group
of conservative businessmen who
fear a Kennedy dynasty is in the
offing. Disgusted by civil rights
legislation, an announced cut in
the oil depletion tax allowance,
and cutbacks in Vietnam troop
strength, the men decide to kill
John Kennedy.
(Never mind Kennedy's
behavior during the Bay of Pigs
and Cuban missile crises. Reality
— and logic — must not be
allowed to interfere with Art or
Conspiracy Theory.)
The ,men decide to kill
Kennedy on June 5, 1973 — the
opening scene of the movie. The
rest of the film is a race against
time as they plot the assassination
and how to frame Lee Harvey-
Oswald.
Most of the material was simply

trotted out of Mark Lane's old
attack on the Warren Commission,
Rush To Judgement; as such, it is
not new or controversial, as the
movie's publicity implies.
New Theories
The movie does try to extend a
couple of new theories, but does
it so poorly that it's hardly worth
mentioning. It implies Oswald was
being employed by one or more
United States intelligence
agencies, but which ones, why,
and what that had to do with
Kennedy's assasination are never
explained.
Executive Action's producers
would have done well to pay
attention to Day of the Jackal, a
film about a plot to kill Charles de
Gaulle. Jackal was made -in tight
documentary style, and as a result

is more interesting and exciting.
(Of course, it also had a decent
script and good acting.)
The only really suspenseful
scene in the movie is the
Presidential motorcade (shown in
real footage) rolling down the
streets of Dallas while the
assassins make final preparations.
But it's also the most painful:
Jackie Kennedy's blood-spattered
dress and wilted flowers bring
back a flood of terrible memories
that most of us would doubtless
prefer to store away.
One can only wish that, if we
must go through the whole
controversy once more, we could
do at the urging of a better movie
than Executive Action. Both as a
movie and as a conspiracy theory,
it's a total failure.

The movie does try to extend a
couple of new theories, but does
it so poorly that it's hardly worth
mentioning. It implies Oswald was
being employed by one or more
United States intelligence
agencies, but which ones, why,
and what that had to do with
Kennedy's assasination are never
explained.
Executive Action's producers
would have done well to pay
attention to Day of the Jackal, a
film about a plot to kill Charles de
Gaulle. Jackal was made -in tight
documentary style, and as a result

is more interesting and exciting.
(Of course, it also had a decent
script and good acting.)
The only really suspenseful
scene in the movie is the
Presidential motorcade (shown in
real footage) rolling down the
streets of Dallas while the
assassins make final preparations.
But it's also the most painful:
Jackie Kennedy's blood-spattered
dress and wilted flowers bring
back a flood of terrible memories
that most of us would doubtless
prefer to store away.
One can only wish that, if we
must go through the whole
controversy once more, we could
do at the urging of a better movie
than Executive Action. Both as a
movie and as a conspiracy theory,
it's a total failure.
Just a little over 10 years ago,
someone gunned down President
John F. Kennedy in Dallas and
provided America with the
greatest murder mystery of the
century.
Countless books have been
written in an attempt to prove
that Lee Harvey Oswald, the man
the Warren Commission pinned
with the assassin's tag, either didn't
do it or had a great deal of help.
It's been some time now since
the evening news reports were full
of talk about the "one bullet
theory" or "the puff of smoke on
the grassy knoll" or "the doctored
photograph." But you can expect
to hear those phrases kicked
about quite a bit in the month to
come, because a new movie has
dredged up the issue again.
It's Executive Action, written
by Dalton Trumbo (Johnny Got
His Gun, Spartacus) and based on
a novel by Master Conspirator
Theorists Donald Freed and Mark
Lane. And if you're thinking of
investing $3 to see if it solves the
mystery, forget it.
Terrible
Not only does it fail to shed
new light on the assassination, it's
a terrible movie.
Trumbo reportedly got
$250,000 for the screenplay, and
if Executive Action's screenplay
was worth that much, then the
review you're reading deserves a
cool million. Trumbo's dialog is
wooden — which matches quite
nicely with the expressions of
most of the actors — and the
entire movie sounds like one side
of a debate. Characters in
Executive Action don't talk so
much as they lecture.
What they say isn't particularly

well-phrased. Right-wing fanatics,
for instance, did not use the word
"black" in 1963. In those days it
was still "nigger."
The acting is worse, which is
saying quite a bit. Burt Lancaster,
as a right-wing millionaire
managing the assassination
attempt, brings such a
blockheaded intensity to the role
that it looks like he did the whole
movie with a hangover. Every
once in a while he starts to wake
up, hears one of his own lines, and
goes back under.
Worse
Robert Ryan, as another
member of the millionaire cabal,
looks resigned to the whole mess.
Perhaps he was; he died two days
after the movie was finished. It's
unfortunate that such a fine actor
had to end his career in such a
terrible movie.
The theory the film advances is
at least as muddled as the acting.
Briefly, it centers around a group
of conservative businessmen who
fear a Kennedy dynasty is in the
offing. Disgusted by civil rights
legislation, an announced cut in
the oil depletion tax allowance,
and cutbacks in Vietnam troop
strength, the men decide to kill
John Kennedy.
(Never mind Kennedy's
behavior during the Bay of Pigs
and Cuban missile crises. Reality
— and logic — must not be
allowed to interfere with Art or
Conspiracy Theory.)
The ,men decide to kill
Kennedy on June 5, 1973 — the
opening scene of the movie. The
rest of the film is a race against
time as they plot the assassination
and how to frame Lee Harvey-
Oswald.
Most of the material was simply

trotted out of Mark Lane's old
attack on the Warren Commission,
Rush To Judgement; as such, it is
not new or controversial, as the
movie's publicity implies.

looks resigned to the whole mess.
Perhaps he was; he died two days
after the movie was finished. It's
unfortunate that such a fine actor
had to end his career in such a
terrible movie.
The theory the film advances is
at least as muddled as the acting.
Briefly, it centers around a group
of conservative businessmen who
fear a Kennedy dynasty is in the
offing. Disgusted by civil rights
legislation, an announced cut in
the oil depletion tax allowance,
and cutbacks in Vietnam troop
strength, the men decide to kill
John Kennedy.
(Never mind Kennedy's
behavior during the Bay of Pigs
and Cuban missile crises. Reality
— and logic — must not be
allowed to interfere with Art or
Conspiracy Theory.)
The ,men decide to kill
Kennedy on June 5, 1973 — the
opening scene of the movie. The
rest of the film is a race against
time as they plot the assassination
and how to frame Lee Harvey-
Oswald.
Most of the material was simply

trotted out of Mark Lane's old
attack on the Warren Commission,
Rush To Judgement; as such, it is
not new or controversial, as the
movie's publicity implies.
New Theories
The movie does try to extend a
couple of new theories, but does
it so poorly that it's hardly worth
mentioning. It implies Oswald was
being employed by one or more
United States intelligence
agencies, but which ones, why,
and what that had to do with
Kennedy's assasination are never
explained.
Executive Action's producers
would have done well to pay
attention to Day of the Jackal, a
film about a plot to kill Charles de
Gaulle. Jackal was made -in tight
documentary style, and as a result

is more interesting and exciting.
(Of course, it also had a decent
script and good acting.)
The only really suspenseful
scene in the movie is the
Presidential motorcade (shown in
real footage) rolling down the
streets of Dallas while the
assassins make final preparations.
But it's also the most painful:
Jackie Kennedy's blood-spattered
dress and wilted flowers bring
back a flood of terrible memories
that most of us would doubtless
prefer to store away.
One can only wish that, if we
must go through the whole
controversy once more, we could
do at the urging of a better movie
than Executive Action. Both as a
movie and as a conspiracy theory,
it's a total failure.
