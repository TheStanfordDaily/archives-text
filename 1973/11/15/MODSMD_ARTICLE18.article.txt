Gas Rationing Possible
WASHINGTON — Energy planners may send the
President in about one month proposals for rationing
gasoline, a key official said yesterday.
He said the planners intend to submit proposals within
two or three weeks for immediate rationing of
home-heating oil.
The administration has been developing a gasoline
rationing plan using ration coupons managed through
some 6000 local boards.
Gasoline ration levels have not been determined but
government officials have been thinking, so far, in terms
of about 10 to 15 gallons per motorist per week — a range
which may change drastically once all the calculations are
finished.
At a press briefing yesterday, the White House repeated
that President Nixon and Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz view gasoline rationing only as a last resort.
An official who declined to be identified also said
President Nixon "would like us to avoid a rationing
system if we could."
But he said "most of the senior advisers agree there
should be a rationing plan," at least for home-heating oil,
which he called "the real problem."
Prisoner Exchange Begins
TEL AVIV — Egyptian and Israeli negotiators, meeting
at a desert outpost on the Middle East ceasefire line, have
agreed to start exchanging prisoners of war today, the Red
Cross announced.
The agreement announced yesterday in Tel Aviv ended
a stalemate that had threatened to break down the shaky
U.S.-sponsored Middle East truce agreement.
The Israeli state radio announced that the prisoner
exchange would be accompanied by a transfer of
checkpoints on the strategic Cairo-Suez road from Israeli
to U.N. control.
The road is the route for supplying the Egyptian city
of Suez and the Egyptian Third Army, isolated across the
Suez Canal in the Sinai Desert. Israel had refused to turn
over the highway checkpoints and allow supplies to pass
until agreement was reached on a prisoner return.
The Red Cross representative in Israel, Michel
Convaire, said the prisoner exchange would be
accomplished by direct flights between Egypt and Israel.
The Egyptian government previously had barred direct
flights to the Jewish state.
Israel says it holds about 7000 Arab prisoners, of
which 6900 are Egyptian and the remaining 100 are
Syrians, Moroccans, Iraqis and Jordanians. It figures that
Egypt has about 350 Israeli POWs and Syria holds another
100.
Egypt, on the other hand, says it has only 245 Israeli
POWs and claims Israel is holding 8400 Egyptians.
Nixon Will Fight Impeachment
WASHINGTON — President Nixon firmly told
Republican congressmen yesterday that his resignation is

not the way out of the Watergate dilemma and he is
willing to face impeachment and fight it if necessary.
"If it comes to impeachment, so be it. We'll present
our facts," Nixon was quoted by Rep. Mark Andrews,
R-N.D., as saying.
But congressmen present at a two-hour breakfast
meeting at the White House said Nixon made it clear he
was not going to resign. Instead, they said, he would
"start very soon with full disclosure of the facts."
The President also was quoted as saying he would not
go before the full Senate Watergate committee but might
agree to some other method of responding to its questions
and requests for information.
Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., said Nixon "definitely
left open the possibility" of talking with committee
Chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr. D-N.C., and Vice Chairman
Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.
Middle East Domination Opposed
TOKYO — The United States and China declared
yesterday they would oppose any efforts by one or more
nations to dominate the Middle East or any other part of
the world.
The pledge, apparently designed to reassure China
about the Soviet Union in light of its detente with the
United States, was part of a communique summing up the
four-day talks in Peking between U.S. Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger and Chinese leaders, including
Communist party Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier
Chou En-lai.
The document also indicated that the U.S. and China
have taken new steps to broaden the basis of their
relations, but without setting a timetable for actual
diplomatic recognition.
Nearing the end of a globe-circling diplomatic trip,
during which he helped put together a Middle East
ceasefire agreement, Kissinger met with Japanese leaders
for talks centering chiefly on Japan's oil shortages
resulting from Middle East cutbacks.
Princess Anne Married

husband slipped off to the countryside last night for the

Buckingham Palace sources said Anne and Mark
Phillips were spending the night at the secluded home of
her cousin, Princess Alexandra nestled in the center of the
2,258-acre Richmond Park in South London.
They leave today by air for Barbados and an 18-day
cruise of the Caribbean and the Pacific off South America
aboard the royal yacht Britannia.
