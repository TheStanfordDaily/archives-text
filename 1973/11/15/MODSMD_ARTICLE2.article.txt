# Health Center Seeks To Hire Gynecologist
## 
### AMY SABRIN 
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Health Center says serious
negotiations are underway to hire a
part-time gynecologist to replace Dr.
Sue Ellen Massey, who left last month.
"It is anticipated he will join the staff
in a few weeks," McClenahan said in a
phone interview.
Arrangements have been made for a
gynecologist to visit Cowell next
Tuesday to handle pressing cases, a
receptionist there reported.
After hearing reports on how other
universities and clinics meet the
medical needs of women, the Task
Force on Women's Medical Care has
decided to approach the community
and the infirmary with possible
options to the present service at
Cowell.
The group's findings will be
discussed in depth at a meeting open
to the general public tonight at 9 p.m.
in ATO House.
Central Issues
The Task Force met last Thursday,
and agreed on four central issues: the
use of peer counselors and paramedics
to provide contraceptive care and sex
information to all students; improved
resources for sex education on
campus; the eligibility of student
spouses and non-student sex partners
for contraceptive care at Cowell; and
the hiring of a second, part-time
gynecologist, preferably a woman.
Citing examples from other
facilities in the Bay Area, members
described how specially trained
paramedics and/or students could be
available all the time to answer
students' questions about birth control
and sex.
Not only would students feel more
comfortable discussing problems with
their peers, they pointed out, but this
system would also free doctors from
counseling and allow them to
concentrate on medical care.
Lyse Sternad, a member of both
the Task Force and the Students
Advisory Committee at Cowell,
reported doctors at Cowell are open to
the idea, and McClenahan confirmed
this.
Sex Education
The Task Force agreed that
improved sex education is needed at
Stanford. They are considering classes
and discussions in living groups, and
publishing a frank pamphlet on sex, as
possible methods.

Task Force members feel strongly
that Cowell should provide
contraceptive care for students' wives
and girl friends. "By not doing this,
what is Cowell saying to men?" asked
Ed Lowry, a first-year law student.
"They're telling men birth control is a
woman's problem, and not a couple's
decision."
McClenahan reported that the
Advisory Committee was looking into
ways to provide students' dependents
with full medical care, not just
contraception. He said Cowell is "open
to the possibility. The question is, who
would pay for it? I don't see anything
wrong with the idea philosophically."
New Practitioner
In addition to the new
gynecologist, McClenahan reorted, Dr.
Jean Green, a general practitioner, has
just come to Cowell from Planned
Parenthood. She will be doing

contraceptive care and pelvic exams
five half-days a week.
Task Force members who
researched facilities at other
universities and clinics reported how
women's medical care is handled at
UC-Berkeley, Yale, Wellesley, Mt.
Holyoke, the Haight-Ashbury Free
Clinic, the Haight-Ashbury Women's

Clinic and the Berkeley Free Clinic.
They decided to model their
suggestions on Berkeley and Yale.
At Berkeley, the university has
three female-oriented clinics associated
with the hospital: a walk-in counseling
clinic, a gynecological clinic, and a
contraceptive clinic with a five-person
staff. Paramedics handle sex and birth
control counseling on a drop-in basis,
and a small class is given once a week
on the different methods of birth
control.
At Yale, Dr. Philip Sarrel, an
associate professor of gynecology and
obstetrics at the medical school, and
his wife, Lorna, a social worker,
provide sex counseling of the Masters
and Johnson type for student couples.

counseling and allow them to
concentrate on medical care.
Lyse Sternad, a member of both
the Task Force and the Students
Advisory Committee at Cowell,
reported doctors at Cowell are open to
the idea, and McClenahan confirmed
this.
Sex Education
The Task Force agreed that
improved sex education is needed at
Stanford. They are considering classes
and discussions in living groups, and
publishing a frank pamphlet on sex, as
possible methods.

Task Force members feel strongly
that Cowell should provide
contraceptive care for students' wives
and girl friends. "By not doing this,
what is Cowell saying to men?" asked
Ed Lowry, a first-year law student.
"They're telling men birth control is a
woman's problem, and not a couple's
decision."
McClenahan reported that the
Advisory Committee was looking into
ways to provide students' dependents
with full medical care, not just
contraception. He said Cowell is "open
to the possibility. The question is, who
would pay for it? I don't see anything
wrong with the idea philosophically."
New Practitioner
In addition to the new
gynecologist, McClenahan reorted, Dr.
Jean Green, a general practitioner, has
just come to Cowell from Planned
Parenthood. She will be doing

contraceptive care and pelvic exams
five half-days a week.
Task Force members who
researched facilities at other
universities and clinics reported how
women's medical care is handled at
UC-Berkeley, Yale, Wellesley, Mt.
Holyoke, the Haight-Ashbury Free
Clinic, the Haight-Ashbury Women's

Clinic and the Berkeley Free Clinic.
They decided to model their
suggestions on Berkeley and Yale.
At Berkeley, the university has
three female-oriented clinics associated
with the hospital: a walk-in counseling
clinic, a gynecological clinic, and a
contraceptive clinic with a five-person
staff. Paramedics handle sex and birth
control counseling on a drop-in basis,
and a small class is given once a week
on the different methods of birth
control.
At Yale, Dr. Philip Sarrel, an
associate professor of gynecology and
obstetrics at the medical school, and
his wife, Lorna, a social worker,
provide sex counseling of the Masters
and Johnson type for student couples.
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Health Center says serious
negotiations are underway to hire a
part-time gynecologist to replace Dr.
Sue Ellen Massey, who left last month.
"It is anticipated he will join the staff
in a few weeks," McClenahan said in a
phone interview.
Arrangements have been made for a
gynecologist to visit Cowell next
Tuesday to handle pressing cases, a
receptionist there reported.
After hearing reports on how other
universities and clinics meet the
medical needs of women, the Task
Force on Women's Medical Care has
decided to approach the community
and the infirmary with possible
options to the present service at
Cowell.
The group's findings will be
discussed in depth at a meeting open
to the general public tonight at 9 p.m.
in ATO House.
Central Issues
The Task Force met last Thursday,
and agreed on four central issues: the
use of peer counselors and paramedics
to provide contraceptive care and sex
information to all students; improved
resources for sex education on
campus; the eligibility of student
spouses and non-student sex partners
for contraceptive care at Cowell; and
the hiring of a second, part-time
gynecologist, preferably a woman.
Citing examples from other
facilities in the Bay Area, members
described how specially trained
paramedics and/or students could be
available all the time to answer
students' questions about birth control
and sex.
Not only would students feel more
comfortable discussing problems with
their peers, they pointed out, but this
system would also free doctors from
counseling and allow them to
concentrate on medical care.
