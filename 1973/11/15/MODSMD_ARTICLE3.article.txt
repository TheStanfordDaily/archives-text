# Minority Students Blast Lyman

Saying they represented Stanford's
"communities of color," seven
students last night blasted President
Richard Lyman for an "assault on the
integrity of student leaders" and a
"lack of sensitivity" to minority
students.
At a hastily-called press conference
the group responded to a prepared
statement Lyman read Tuesday on
KZSU with a statement of their own,
and then answered questions for an
hour.
In his remarks (quoted at length in
Campus Report yesterday), the
president harshly criticized chicano
leaders who organized a Tuesday noon

rally in front of his office. He said
they failed to correct the "set of
mistaken assumptions and incendiary
rumors" believed by participants in
the rally.
The group last night included
Charles Ogletree, ASSU vice president;
Phil Baptista, a first-year law student;
Derek Tolliver, BSU co-chairman; and
Carol Castillo of MEChA.
'Fiery Lies'
Baptista claimed that Lyman
"lambasted the chicano community
and said we told fiery lies" in his
criticism of rally organizers. And he
said the president's statement
contained "veiled threats" of "play
ball or else" to chicanos.

The group's prepared statement
juxtaposed and switched the order of
two separated paragraph's in Lyman's
statement, changing the emphasis and
meaning significantly.
The rally ostensibly protested the
planned move of the Office of Chicano
Affairs from Building 1 to Building 80,
but Castillo said, "We decided that it
was a small issue, a symbolic issue —
the time is now to express to the
University that our needs are not being
met in various areas."
Decision Defended
The group statement criticized
Lyman for claiming that a rally
speaker "at least implied" that the
chicano affairs office would be moved
to a trailer. But Baptista defended his
decision to prohibit Provost William
Miller from addressing the crowd when
Miller tried to clear the
misunderstanding over the trailer.
"It would be the equivalent of n.y
going to a Board of Trustees meeting
and saying 'let me rap now,' " Baptista
claimed, arguing that Miller "was not a
scheduled speaker" at the rally.
Members of the group lauded the
work of the Chicano Executive
Committee, an ad hoc group working
with the president and provost.
Castillo said it represents but cannot
speak entirely for the chicano
community because the community

COMMUNITY OF COLOR — Black Students Union Co-Chairman Derek Tolliver and first year law student Phil Baptista
were among seven students who blasted President Richard Lyman at a press conference last night. The students claimed
Lyman had insulted the Chicano community during his remarks made on KZSU's "Campus Conference" program
Tuesday night.
"will always be asking for more than
the committee wili be able to
negotiate with."
She and Baptista said the
community will always act directly on
important issues the committee cannot
negotiate.
Ogletree, Baptista and Castillo all
demanded that the University give
decision-making power on minority
programs to chicano and black
students. "We see symbolically people
of color taking a back seat to whatever

priorities the University is
developing," Castillo said.
Everyone in the group objected to
the University's policy of
decentralizing minority programs and
placing responsibility at lower levels.
Tolliver said the poliey was designed
"to slow our progress."
Although Baptista acknowledged
that minority programs have escaped
University-wide budget cuts and
received more money each year, he
said "there has been a reduction in

programs for people of color on this
campus in quality, not in quantity.
There has been a general feeling that
the University has lost its commitment
to us."
Members of the group did not state
specific policy recommendations, but
objected to the low number of tenured
minority professors, the lack of an
interim Office of Black Affairs, a lack
of fund-raising for minority programs,
and the abolition of Stanford's
Minority Affairs and Minority
Employment committees.
