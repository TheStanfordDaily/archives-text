# Proposed Law May Hinder Campus Growth
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The proposed Santa Clara County
City Services (CS) Zoning Ordinance,
if not amended, would force the
University to seek piecemeal
annexation of its campus lands to Palo
Alto as a condition to new
construction planned by the
University, according to Michael
Hudnall, associate staff counsel here.
"The ordinance was designed to
promote orderly urban development
by preventing the leapfrog growth of
building projects with inadequate
planning and services on
unincorporated land in the county,"
Hudnall explained. "It would require
almost all new construction near
incorporated cities to be approved by
the municipalities, by requiring the
builder to request the annexation of
the land on which the construction
would take place."
Since the campus is a fully
developed, permanent community
which provides its own municipal
services, the University administration
feels that control of the school's
development by Palo Alto would not
further the purposes of the ordinance
and would be a "very real" burden on
the University, Hudnall contended.
But Hudnall said he doesn't believe
that the county meant the ordinance
to have such an effect.
Unique Position
"When the ordinance was drafted,
the drafters probably didn't take into
consideration the uniqueness of
Stanford's position," Hudnall
remarked. "I don't believe that they

meant for Stanford to lose control
over campus planning."
In order to study the effect that the
plan would have on Stanford, the Palo
Alto City Council asked its planning
commission to study the proposed
ordinance and make a
recommendation regarding it.
At the Council's meeting last
Monday night, Naphtali Knox, the
Palo Alto planning director, told the
City Council that the Planning

Commission suggested another
amendment to the county ordinance.
The new proposal would explicitly
include the academic campus under
the CS ordinance and delegate to Palo
Alto the right to approve and reject all
projects.
Good Job
Stanford has done a good job of
planning its campus, but that does not
assure that it will continue to do a
good job, Knox declared at the

meeting.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
objected to the proposal and sent a
letter to the City Council which
outlined his argument.
However, recognizing the city's
interest in University projects,
Augsburger offered to form an
agreement with Palo Alto whereby the
University would submit advance
