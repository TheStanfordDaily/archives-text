# Fuel Crisis Blamed On Lack Of Planning
## 
### JOHN FREED 
An energy crisis would not threaten
Americans today if national energy
policymakers had heeded warning
signals a decade ago, Political Science
Prof. Robert North asserted last night.
North, at Stanford since 1946,
claimed that shortsighted planners
refused to consider the relation
between resources, technology, and
population. He spoke before an
audience of 30 persons in the Trancos
lounge.
"Resources [were] not
systematically related to population
and technology. Population [was] in
one box, technology in another,
resources in another," he noted. "If it
had been done rationally, planning
could have begun 10 or 12 years ago.

It just took this war to bring things to
a head."
North stated that a rising
technology creates new demands faster
than it satisfies them.
"Technology enables us to dig
deeper for resources [such as oil]. But
as technology increases overall,
demands of the technology become
much larger," North observed.
He cited a huge per capita
consumption of energy in the United
States as evidence supporting this
point.
"Primary energy consumption per
capita in the U.S. in 1970 was roughly
12,500 kilograms of coal. In Sweden,
the figure was 8000; in the Soviet
Union, about 4800; in Japan, 3500;
China, 500; and in Burundi, the lowest
among the world's nations, it was 9
kilograms of coal," he recited.
This disparity in consumption has
effects on international politics, North
hypothesized. "High capability" states
seek resources from other countries
through trade or conquest, he said.
"Eventually, they feel their access
to resources should be protected by
force," North postulated. He noted
that this feeling indirectly led to
American involvement in Vietnam.
"The United States at that time
[the early 19505] did not need the

resources of Southeast Asia that
desperately. The country that
absolutely had to have access is Japan.
And the country that could guarantee
Japan access to Southeast Asia would
win it into its I political] sphere.
"It wasn't all strategic or all
resources, but a complicated mixture,"
North concluded.
North claimed that one way to
alleviate the situation would be for the
United States to cut back on
consumption.
"Because U.S. gross consumption is
so large, you could alleviate the
situation by this action," North stated.
