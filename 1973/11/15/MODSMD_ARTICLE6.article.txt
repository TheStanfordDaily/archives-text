# Experts Call Tape Doctoring Difficult To Detect
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
By Nov. 20, the joint team of Justice Department and
White House experts will have analyzed the Watergate
tapes for possible tampering. If there are any "dirty
tricks" to uncover, the success of the hounds will depend
a great deal on the fox's mistakes in covering his tracks.
"As of today, it is possible to alter a tape
undetectably," said San Francisco private investigator
Harold Lipset, a former member of Senate Watergate
Committee's staff. "But you would have to do a perfect
job," he added.
Dennis Davie, an electrical engineer at Stanford's
Instructional Television Network, said that if the doctored
duplicate and the original tape were done on the same
machine under identical conditions," you could never find
it. And if you could find it, you could never prove it."
A number of experts, including Lipset, stated that no
present means exists to prove that a doctored tape was
not the original. But Lipset commented, "That isn't to say
that somebody won't come up tomorrow with a foolproof
way to detect doctoring."
According to Lipset, Davie and Stanford systems
theorist Jeff Gordon, the main problem for tape sleuths
would be the addition of "artificial noise" to obscure
conversations or to cover up splices. "Noise generators"
and other electronic means can be used to mix random
"white noise" on all frequencies or to amplify "room
reverberations."
Optimum Filter
Gordon said that even a computer-run "optimum
filter" program, which separates out speech patterns from

other sound wave frequencies, would not find anything
"unless you knew some characteristic of the signal you
were looking for." Without a precise knowledge of what
was said and when it was said, the voice signal could not
effectively be identified.
Gordon and Mark Lawrence, chief engineer at KZSU,
both speculated that the only way to trace this kind of
doctoring would be to record new tapes on the original
equipment, in the Watergate case, Sony 800Bs. If the
blank tapes had a far lower level of noise interference than
the suspect tape, then there would be grounds for further
examination.
On the other hand, Gordon said that tape recorders can
be easily adjusted to any level of background noise
desired.
Another undetectable way to obscure a tape, according
to Davie, would involve running it through a weak
magnetic field. All the sound-recording magnetic impulses
would be realigned and the sound distorted, he said.
Background Noise
Could background noise completely disguise splicing?
Ordinarily, a tape can be edited to fool the ear (as KPIX
demonstrated recently by inverting several phrases of a
Nixon speech).
Paul Stubblebine, a recording technician at Columbia
Records, thinks that a good editor can change just about
anything. "People around here have synthesized words
using just recorded speech parts," he said.
Normal razor splicing, however, even when re-recorded,
will leave a break in the ultra-high "bias frequency" used
to reduce distortion, according to engineer Dennis

Minnick of San Francisco's McCune Studios. Such
interruptions would show up on an oscilloscope or on a
computer-run spectrum analysis.
The addition of "noise" changes the whole equation.
Since looking through hours of tape to find a splice is a
time-consuming process to begin with, trying to pick out
the minute irregularity in the "bias frequency" when that
frequency is filled with other distractions would probably
be impossible in practical terms, engineer Davie said.
Then again, there is the computer, which is the best
splicer and editor in the business, according to Dr. Neil
Miller of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab.
Computer Manipulation
"You can't today synthesize speech," Dr. Miller said.
However, "you can take speech into a computer and
manipulate it without anyone knowing the difference."
Miller explained that a digital computer can "sample"
the wave signals of a conversation and of the background
noise and reproduce this information in a mathematical
pattern.
"Once you have sampled a signal from a tape, you have
recorded it precisely," he said. "You could throw the old
one away."
This "sample" of impulses could be played back in any
order. A programmer could juggle a speech without being
detected electronically.
Since the splices themselves would be hard to detect in
a sophisticated cover-up job, investigators might resort to
checking the speech patterns for inconsistencies.
Vocal Trade-Marks
According to one researcher at the Stanford Research

Institute, scientists can now detect the vocal trade-marks
of a given individual. They are learning to predict if the
inflection or the acoustics of a taped voice fit normal
patterns. If a conversation were edited without regard for
these minute details, speech scientists might be able to
point to the probability of doctoring.
In other research projects, scientists are working to
predict the "multipath reverberations of sounds," one
Stanford faculty member said. What this means is that the
location of a speaker in a room will soon be able to be
figured out from an analysis of a tape.
Nevertheless, both speech science and acoustics are in
their infancy. They will probably not play a major part in
the Watergate investigation right now.
Future Concerns
If the Watergate tapes are doctored by an expert, the
chances of detecting the job through hardware alone are
slim. But, in the words of the faculty member, "whoever
may be in the business of doctoring should be concerned
about detection in the future." Nobody is expected to let
the tapes go loose in the near future after they have
passed into Judge Sirica's hands on Nov. 20.
There is also the problem of human slip-up. To
cover-up a tape doctoring demands that everyone
involved, including the engineers, make no mistakes in
their testimony.
In addition, all records and all appointments calendars
will have to match the story of the tapes. As Lipset said,
"Any proof that the Watergate tapes were not the
originals, or that they had been altered, would destroy
White House credibility forever."

Miller of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab.
Computer Manipulation
"You can't today synthesize speech," Dr. Miller said.
However, "you can take speech into a computer and
manipulate it without anyone knowing the difference."
Miller explained that a digital computer can "sample"
the wave signals of a conversation and of the background
noise and reproduce this information in a mathematical
pattern.
"Once you have sampled a signal from a tape, you have
recorded it precisely," he said. "You could throw the old
one away."
This "sample" of impulses could be played back in any
order. A programmer could juggle a speech without being
detected electronically.
Since the splices themselves would be hard to detect in
a sophisticated cover-up job, investigators might resort to
checking the speech patterns for inconsistencies.
Vocal Trade-Marks
According to one researcher at the Stanford Research

Institute, scientists can now detect the vocal trade-marks
of a given individual. They are learning to predict if the
inflection or the acoustics of a taped voice fit normal
patterns. If a conversation were edited without regard for
these minute details, speech scientists might be able to
point to the probability of doctoring.
In other research projects, scientists are working to
predict the "multipath reverberations of sounds," one
Stanford faculty member said. What this means is that the
location of a speaker in a room will soon be able to be
figured out from an analysis of a tape.
Nevertheless, both speech science and acoustics are in
their infancy. They will probably not play a major part in
the Watergate investigation right now.
Future Concerns
If the Watergate tapes are doctored by an expert, the
chances of detecting the job through hardware alone are
slim. But, in the words of the faculty member, "whoever
may be in the business of doctoring should be concerned
about detection in the future." Nobody is expected to let
the tapes go loose in the near future after they have
passed into Judge Sirica's hands on Nov. 20.
There is also the problem of human slip-up. To
cover-up a tape doctoring demands that everyone
involved, including the engineers, make no mistakes in
their testimony.
In addition, all records and all appointments calendars
will have to match the story of the tapes. As Lipset said,
"Any proof that the Watergate tapes were not the
originals, or that they had been altered, would destroy
White House credibility forever."
By Nov. 20, the joint team of Justice Department and
White House experts will have analyzed the Watergate
tapes for possible tampering. If there are any "dirty
tricks" to uncover, the success of the hounds will depend
a great deal on the fox's mistakes in covering his tracks.
"As of today, it is possible to alter a tape
undetectably," said San Francisco private investigator
Harold Lipset, a former member of Senate Watergate
Committee's staff. "But you would have to do a perfect
job," he added.
Dennis Davie, an electrical engineer at Stanford's
Instructional Television Network, said that if the doctored
duplicate and the original tape were done on the same
machine under identical conditions," you could never find
it. And if you could find it, you could never prove it."
A number of experts, including Lipset, stated that no
present means exists to prove that a doctored tape was
not the original. But Lipset commented, "That isn't to say
that somebody won't come up tomorrow with a foolproof
way to detect doctoring."
According to Lipset, Davie and Stanford systems
theorist Jeff Gordon, the main problem for tape sleuths
would be the addition of "artificial noise" to obscure
conversations or to cover up splices. "Noise generators"
and other electronic means can be used to mix random
"white noise" on all frequencies or to amplify "room
reverberations."
Optimum Filter
Gordon said that even a computer-run "optimum
filter" program, which separates out speech patterns from

other sound wave frequencies, would not find anything
"unless you knew some characteristic of the signal you
were looking for." Without a precise knowledge of what
was said and when it was said, the voice signal could not
effectively be identified.
Gordon and Mark Lawrence, chief engineer at KZSU,
both speculated that the only way to trace this kind of
doctoring would be to record new tapes on the original
equipment, in the Watergate case, Sony 800Bs. If the
blank tapes had a far lower level of noise interference than
the suspect tape, then there would be grounds for further
examination.
On the other hand, Gordon said that tape recorders can
be easily adjusted to any level of background noise
desired.
Another undetectable way to obscure a tape, according
to Davie, would involve running it through a weak
magnetic field. All the sound-recording magnetic impulses
would be realigned and the sound distorted, he said.
Background Noise
Could background noise completely disguise splicing?
Ordinarily, a tape can be edited to fool the ear (as KPIX
demonstrated recently by inverting several phrases of a
Nixon speech).
Paul Stubblebine, a recording technician at Columbia
Records, thinks that a good editor can change just about
anything. "People around here have synthesized words
using just recorded speech parts," he said.
Normal razor splicing, however, even when re-recorded,
will leave a break in the ultra-high "bias frequency" used
to reduce distortion, according to engineer Dennis

Minnick of San Francisco's McCune Studios. Such
interruptions would show up on an oscilloscope or on a
computer-run spectrum analysis.
The addition of "noise" changes the whole equation.
Since looking through hours of tape to find a splice is a
time-consuming process to begin with, trying to pick out
the minute irregularity in the "bias frequency" when that
frequency is filled with other distractions would probably
be impossible in practical terms, engineer Davie said.

theorist Jeff Gordon, the main problem for tape sleuths
would be the addition of "artificial noise" to obscure
conversations or to cover up splices. "Noise generators"
and other electronic means can be used to mix random
"white noise" on all frequencies or to amplify "room
reverberations."
Optimum Filter
Gordon said that even a computer-run "optimum
filter" program, which separates out speech patterns from

other sound wave frequencies, would not find anything
"unless you knew some characteristic of the signal you
were looking for." Without a precise knowledge of what
was said and when it was said, the voice signal could not
effectively be identified.
Gordon and Mark Lawrence, chief engineer at KZSU,
both speculated that the only way to trace this kind of
doctoring would be to record new tapes on the original
equipment, in the Watergate case, Sony 800Bs. If the
blank tapes had a far lower level of noise interference than
the suspect tape, then there would be grounds for further
examination.
On the other hand, Gordon said that tape recorders can
be easily adjusted to any level of background noise
desired.
Another undetectable way to obscure a tape, according
to Davie, would involve running it through a weak
magnetic field. All the sound-recording magnetic impulses
would be realigned and the sound distorted, he said.
Background Noise
Could background noise completely disguise splicing?
Ordinarily, a tape can be edited to fool the ear (as KPIX
demonstrated recently by inverting several phrases of a
Nixon speech).
Paul Stubblebine, a recording technician at Columbia
Records, thinks that a good editor can change just about
anything. "People around here have synthesized words
using just recorded speech parts," he said.
Normal razor splicing, however, even when re-recorded,
will leave a break in the ultra-high "bias frequency" used
to reduce distortion, according to engineer Dennis

Minnick of San Francisco's McCune Studios. Such
interruptions would show up on an oscilloscope or on a
computer-run spectrum analysis.
The addition of "noise" changes the whole equation.
Since looking through hours of tape to find a splice is a
time-consuming process to begin with, trying to pick out
the minute irregularity in the "bias frequency" when that
frequency is filled with other distractions would probably
be impossible in practical terms, engineer Davie said.
Then again, there is the computer, which is the best
splicer and editor in the business, according to Dr. Neil
Miller of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab.
Computer Manipulation
"You can't today synthesize speech," Dr. Miller said.
However, "you can take speech into a computer and
manipulate it without anyone knowing the difference."
Miller explained that a digital computer can "sample"
the wave signals of a conversation and of the background
noise and reproduce this information in a mathematical
pattern.
"Once you have sampled a signal from a tape, you have
recorded it precisely," he said. "You could throw the old
one away."
This "sample" of impulses could be played back in any
order. A programmer could juggle a speech without being
detected electronically.
Since the splices themselves would be hard to detect in
a sophisticated cover-up job, investigators might resort to
checking the speech patterns for inconsistencies.
Vocal Trade-Marks
According to one researcher at the Stanford Research

Institute, scientists can now detect the vocal trade-marks
of a given individual. They are learning to predict if the
inflection or the acoustics of a taped voice fit normal
patterns. If a conversation were edited without regard for
these minute details, speech scientists might be able to
point to the probability of doctoring.
In other research projects, scientists are working to
predict the "multipath reverberations of sounds," one
Stanford faculty member said. What this means is that the
location of a speaker in a room will soon be able to be
figured out from an analysis of a tape.
Nevertheless, both speech science and acoustics are in
their infancy. They will probably not play a major part in
the Watergate investigation right now.
Future Concerns
If the Watergate tapes are doctored by an expert, the
chances of detecting the job through hardware alone are
slim. But, in the words of the faculty member, "whoever
may be in the business of doctoring should be concerned
about detection in the future." Nobody is expected to let
the tapes go loose in the near future after they have
passed into Judge Sirica's hands on Nov. 20.
There is also the problem of human slip-up. To
cover-up a tape doctoring demands that everyone
involved, including the engineers, make no mistakes in
their testimony.
In addition, all records and all appointments calendars
will have to match the story of the tapes. As Lipset said,
"Any proof that the Watergate tapes were not the
originals, or that they had been altered, would destroy
White House credibility forever."
By Nov. 20, the joint team of Justice Department and
White House experts will have analyzed the Watergate
tapes for possible tampering. If there are any "dirty
tricks" to uncover, the success of the hounds will depend
a great deal on the fox's mistakes in covering his tracks.
"As of today, it is possible to alter a tape
undetectably," said San Francisco private investigator
Harold Lipset, a former member of Senate Watergate
Committee's staff. "But you would have to do a perfect
job," he added.
Dennis Davie, an electrical engineer at Stanford's
Instructional Television Network, said that if the doctored
duplicate and the original tape were done on the same
machine under identical conditions," you could never find
it. And if you could find it, you could never prove it."
A number of experts, including Lipset, stated that no
present means exists to prove that a doctored tape was
not the original. But Lipset commented, "That isn't to say
that somebody won't come up tomorrow with a foolproof
way to detect doctoring."
