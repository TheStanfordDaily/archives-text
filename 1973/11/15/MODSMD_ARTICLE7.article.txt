# Student-Faculty Relations
## Lack Of Open Interchange 
### 
(This is the conclusion of a two-part series.)
In Part One of our discussion of The Other
Stanford,- we summarized the findings of The
Student Task Force on Education at Stanford. The
Task Force found that only 28 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are satisfied with student-faculty
relations, that few students know many professors
well, and more alarmingly, that only 38 percent of
all students have been catalyzed to think beyond
the scope of the course work by more than two
professors.
In light of the Task Force's findings, the crucial
question needs to be asked, why are faculty
members so impotent in the development of
students' critical thinking? Laying aside for the time
the equally large burden of blame the students must
share, the remainder of this article will explore the
answer to this question, and seek remedies for this
inexcusable situation.
The reasons for the lack of student-faculty
intellectual interaction must be sought in both the
faculty's perception of their role and the absolute
control the faculty exerts over educational
decisions. During the last twenty years, Stanford has
risen in prominence, until today it is one of the
"great centers of higher education."
At the same time, in the wake of the scientific
explosion that occurred after the war, science and
scientific methods became the basis by which
knowledge and learning were judged. Consequently
research of all kinds took on increased importance
at Stanford, and the role of the professor more and
more became one of a scholar involved in research.
The importance attached to research has great
implications for today; the vast majority of
professors now at Stanford came here wanting and
expecting to do research, and by controlling their
own reward system, they allow themselves to do so.
Minor Consideration
The results are predictable: as reported in The
Other Stanford, undergraduate teaching occupies on
the average but 25 percent of a faculty members'
time. Professors interviewed by the Task Force feel
teaching is a minor consideration in tenure and
promotion decisions while scholarly research is
seen as the single most important source of reward
and promotion.
The secondary importance attached to teaching
is further understandable in light of the Stanford
faculty's perceived self-interest. Professors wish to
maintain and increase the prestige of their
university. Since they see quality judged by their
peers at other institutions in terms of research, they
preserve Stanford's 'prestige' (and by implication
their own) by rewarding research excellence.
Hence, teaching and meaningful interaction with

Hemel & Peers

students are forced into a secondary role. This
shows the danger of having only one of the many
groups in the University making educational
decisions that affect everyone. Being in control of
the decision-making apparatus, faculty members
have been able to advance their own self-interest at
the expense of undergraduate education.
Critical Thinking
The Task Force feels that meaningful and lasting
changes must be made in the University to correct
the shockingly low level of student-faculty
interaction, and in turn to increase the occurrence
of critical thinking. The third section of The Other
Stanford contains the recommendations which we
feel will significantly improve these present defects.
Clearly, it would be impossible to discuss all of the
recommendations in this article, but an analysis of a
few of the most crucial will provide a glimpse of the
reforms needed.
1) Student evaluation of teaching should be
standardized throughout the University, and should
be made mandatory. This recommendation should
require little explanation, but a current proposal on
teacher evaluation before the Faculty Senate has
already eliminated such standardization, thus
reducing the effectiveness of teaching evaluations.
2) Effectiveness in teaching undergraduates
should be an unconditional prerequisite for the
granting of tenure and for promotion from associate
to full professor. Only in this way can the
perception of teaching as a secondary role be
altered. This would be a radical change, moving
against the current of present national attitudes, but
we are asking Stanford to justify its claim to
emminence in education by beginning a new era of
concern for the undergraduate.
3) Students should comprise a significant portion
of the voting members of departmental search and
review committees. In this manner, the perpetuation
of the faculty as researchers can be modified, and
those most directly affected by teaching can gain a
voice in educational decision making. Any argument
against student participation on search committees
which notes students' lack of educational expertise
is as facile as similar arguments against universal
sufferage.
These are only three of the many
recommendations we feel are so crucial to improve
the present weakness of undergraduate education.
We call on the entire Stanford community to discuss
the issues presented in our report, and we call on
President Lyman to convene an ad hoc committee
to explore the implementation of these
recommendations.

'OH, BROTHERâ€”DON'T MAKE ME GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN!'
(This is the conclusion of a two-part series.)
In Part One of our discussion of The Other
Stanford,- we summarized the findings of The
Student Task Force on Education at Stanford. The
Task Force found that only 28 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are satisfied with student-faculty
relations, that few students know many professors
well, and more alarmingly, that only 38 percent of
all students have been catalyzed to think beyond
the scope of the course work by more than two
professors.
In light of the Task Force's findings, the crucial
question needs to be asked, why are faculty
members so impotent in the development of
students' critical thinking? Laying aside for the time
the equally large burden of blame the students must
share, the remainder of this article will explore the
answer to this question, and seek remedies for this
inexcusable situation.
The reasons for the lack of student-faculty
intellectual interaction must be sought in both the
faculty's perception of their role and the absolute
control the faculty exerts over educational
decisions. During the last twenty years, Stanford has
risen in prominence, until today it is one of the
"great centers of higher education."
At the same time, in the wake of the scientific
explosion that occurred after the war, science and
scientific methods became the basis by which
knowledge and learning were judged. Consequently
research of all kinds took on increased importance
at Stanford, and the role of the professor more and
more became one of a scholar involved in research.
The importance attached to research has great
implications for today; the vast majority of
professors now at Stanford came here wanting and
expecting to do research, and by controlling their
own reward system, they allow themselves to do so.
Minor Consideration
The results are predictable: as reported in The
Other Stanford, undergraduate teaching occupies on
the average but 25 percent of a faculty members'
time. Professors interviewed by the Task Force feel
teaching is a minor consideration in tenure and
promotion decisions while scholarly research is
seen as the single most important source of reward
and promotion.
The secondary importance attached to teaching
is further understandable in light of the Stanford
faculty's perceived self-interest. Professors wish to
maintain and increase the prestige of their
university. Since they see quality judged by their
peers at other institutions in terms of research, they
preserve Stanford's 'prestige' (and by implication
their own) by rewarding research excellence.
Hence, teaching and meaningful interaction with

Hemel & Peers

students are forced into a secondary role. This
shows the danger of having only one of the many
groups in the University making educational
decisions that affect everyone. Being in control of
the decision-making apparatus, faculty members
have been able to advance their own self-interest at
the expense of undergraduate education.
Critical Thinking
The Task Force feels that meaningful and lasting
changes must be made in the University to correct
the shockingly low level of student-faculty
interaction, and in turn to increase the occurrence
of critical thinking. The third section of The Other
Stanford contains the recommendations which we
feel will significantly improve these present defects.
Clearly, it would be impossible to discuss all of the
recommendations in this article, but an analysis of a
few of the most crucial will provide a glimpse of the
reforms needed.
1) Student evaluation of teaching should be
standardized throughout the University, and should
be made mandatory. This recommendation should
require little explanation, but a current proposal on
teacher evaluation before the Faculty Senate has
already eliminated such standardization, thus
reducing the effectiveness of teaching evaluations.
2) Effectiveness in teaching undergraduates
should be an unconditional prerequisite for the
granting of tenure and for promotion from associate
to full professor. Only in this way can the
perception of teaching as a secondary role be
altered. This would be a radical change, moving
against the current of present national attitudes, but
we are asking Stanford to justify its claim to
emminence in education by beginning a new era of
concern for the undergraduate.
3) Students should comprise a significant portion
of the voting members of departmental search and
review committees. In this manner, the perpetuation
of the faculty as researchers can be modified, and
those most directly affected by teaching can gain a
voice in educational decision making. Any argument
against student participation on search committees
which notes students' lack of educational expertise
is as facile as similar arguments against universal
sufferage.
These are only three of the many
recommendations we feel are so crucial to improve
the present weakness of undergraduate education.
We call on the entire Stanford community to discuss
the issues presented in our report, and we call on
President Lyman to convene an ad hoc committee
to explore the implementation of these

to explore the implementation of these
recommendations.
