# Continuation Of Nixon's Policies
## U.S. Endangered By Ford Nomination 
### 
The nomination of Gerald
Ford to be Vice President of the
United States gives us the
opportunity, through our elected
representatives, to pass judgment
on one of the key people who
formulated this country's foreign
and domestic policies during the
last ten years.
We have examined Ford's
record and have found that as Vice
President (or as a future
President), he would help
continue the Nixon
administration's foreign and
domestic policies. He supported
many of Nixon's positions that
have led many of us to believe
that the President should be
impeached. We have also found
that Ford has engaged in some
questionable activities during his
campaigns for Congress and
during the 1972 Presidential
election.
On one occasion, Ford received
illegal donations from two
shipping lines (the recipients of
large subsidies from the federal
government). These contributions
to Ford were part of a series for
which the shipping companies
were convicted under the Corrupt
Practices Act and fined the
maximum penalty of $50,000 in
February, 1970.
In 1972, his latest campaign,
Ford received $4,000 from a milk
producers' group and $2,500 from
a bankers' group. The bankers'
group was under investigation by
a House committee and the
Justice Department in 1970 for
attempting to influence a bank

regulation bill in Congress. That
year, Ford received $2,000 from
the same group, while other
Congressmen rejected donations
from the bankers.
Illicit Contributions
One such recent incident is
worth going into in some detail.
In 1970, Ford did not report
$11,500 in campaign
contributions (including the above
mentioned $2,000 from the
banking group) when he acted as
treasurer of his own campaign.
Ford personally signed over
checks from stock brokers, an
oilman, bankers, doctors, and a
union group to Republican
Headquarters in Washington.
Two committees at the
headquarters that were run by the
same man who received the
checks then paid $12,233 of
Ford's campaign debts. Ford said
that there was no connection
between the committee that
received the money and the
committees that spent it. By this
procedure the names of the
special interest groups were not
listed in Ford's sworn campaign
report, although the money
flowed through his hands.
Patrick J. Buchanan, a special
consultant to Nixon, testified
before the Watergate committee
that his strategy was to
concentrate attacks on Senator
Muskie, then the leading
contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination. In early
1971, Buchanan asked "Who
should we get to poke the sharp
stick into his cave and bring

Muskie howling forth?"
Speaking before a group of
Jewish leaders on April 29, 1971,
Ford distorted Muskie's position
on Israel and linked Muskie with
Fulbright's anti-Zionist position in
order to accuse Muskie of
undermining American support
for Israel. Ford's speech was
viewed by observers as an attempt
to draw Jewish contributors away
from liberal Democrats.
Buchanan further testified that
Nixon's people would spur the
press to keep the Chappaquidick
incident in the public mind in
order to raise question's about
Kennedy's fitness for office.
On January 18, 1972 Ford said
that it was strange that Kennedy
would claim that the issue of
public trust in the President is
important, since that issue did
not serve Kennedy's interests.
Ford's press secretary said that
Ford's reference to trust was "an
oblique reference to
Chappaquidick."
Public Record
Gerald Ford has been a leader
in the effort to diminish the civil
liberties of Americans. He has
advocated preventive detention
and wiretapping as well as
so-called anti-riot laws designed to
limit free speech and assembly.
Ford opposed Lyndon
Johnson's 1967 proposal to ban
most public and private
wiretapping and electronic
eavesdropping. He was one of the
major proponents of legislation
that made it a crime to travel
from state to state to incite
"violence." This was the law that
was used to indict the Chicago 8
for conspiracy at the 1968
Democratic convention.
Ford was the sole sponsor of a
Nixon administration bill that
provides for pre-trial preventive
detention of so-called dangerous
persons charged with certain
crimes. Under the provisions of
the bill, a U.S. Attorney can make
a written motion to arrest
someone for the purposes of
holding a pretrial detention
hearing. A judge can hear the
motion without the accused or his
attorney being given an
opportunity to respond. Then the
judge can order the person
arrested and transported to the
place of the hearing. Once
arrested, the person may be kept
in jail for several days before the
hearing. At the hearing itself, the
usual rules of evidence in criminal
cases do not have to be adhered
to.
Political Positions
Ford was a spearhead of the
warhawk position on Indochina.
He was a spokesman for escalation
of the war months and sometimes
years before his suggestions

Evers & Borock

became official policy in the
Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
He was among the first to call
for direct U.S. control of all
battlefield activities (June 1964),
bombing North Vietnam (January
1965), protective reaction strikes
against missile sites and airfields
(July 1965), a naval quarantine of
North Vietnam (December 1965),
bombing Hanoi and Haiphong
(December 1965), and using
military force to close the port of
Haiphong (June 1966). Ford also
opposed holding elections in
Vietnam similar to those called
for in the Geneva accords of 1954
(June 1965).
Ford's position on the
Indochina War is just an example
of his general position in favor of
U.S. military intervention around
the world. He supported
Johnson's invasion of the
Dominican Republic in 1965 and
said afterward that "Johnson
should go even further and crack
down on Cuba."
As recently as November 7,
1973, Ford voted to sustain
Nixon's veto of the war powers
bill that designates precisely how
the President can initiate and
continue hostilities.
In light of the above facts, we
believe that the Congress should
reject the nomination of Gerald
Ford as Vice President of the
United States.

members of the Stanford
Committee to Impeach Nixon.)

warhawk position on Indochina.
He was a spokesman for escalation
of the war months and sometimes
years before his suggestions

Evers & Borock

became official policy in the
Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
He was among the first to call
for direct U.S. control of all
battlefield activities (June 1964),
bombing North Vietnam (January
1965), protective reaction strikes
against missile sites and airfields
(July 1965), a naval quarantine of
North Vietnam (December 1965),
bombing Hanoi and Haiphong
(December 1965), and using
military force to close the port of
Haiphong (June 1966). Ford also
opposed holding elections in
Vietnam similar to those called
for in the Geneva accords of 1954
(June 1965).
Ford's position on the
Indochina War is just an example
of his general position in favor of
U.S. military intervention around
the world. He supported
Johnson's invasion of the
Dominican Republic in 1965 and
said afterward that "Johnson
should go even further and crack
down on Cuba."
As recently as November 7,
1973, Ford voted to sustain
Nixon's veto of the war powers
bill that designates precisely how
the President can initiate and
continue hostilities.
In light of the above facts, we
believe that the Congress should
reject the nomination of Gerald
Ford as Vice President of the
United States.
(Herb Borock and Bill Evers are
members of the Stanford
Committee to Impeach Nixon.)

The nomination of Gerald
Ford to be Vice President of the
United States gives us the
opportunity, through our elected
representatives, to pass judgment
on one of the key people who
formulated this country's foreign
and domestic policies during the
last ten years.
We have examined Ford's
record and have found that as Vice
President (or as a future
President), he would help
continue the Nixon
administration's foreign and
domestic policies. He supported
many of Nixon's positions that
have led many of us to believe
that the President should be
impeached. We have also found
that Ford has engaged in some
questionable activities during his
campaigns for Congress and
during the 1972 Presidential
election.
On one occasion, Ford received
illegal donations from two
shipping lines (the recipients of
large subsidies from the federal
government). These contributions
to Ford were part of a series for
which the shipping companies
were convicted under the Corrupt
Practices Act and fined the
maximum penalty of $50,000 in
February, 1970.
In 1972, his latest campaign,
Ford received $4,000 from a milk
producers' group and $2,500 from
a bankers' group. The bankers'
group was under investigation by
a House committee and the
Justice Department in 1970 for
attempting to influence a bank

regulation bill in Congress. That
year, Ford received $2,000 from
the same group, while other
Congressmen rejected donations
from the bankers.
Illicit Contributions
One such recent incident is
worth going into in some detail.
In 1970, Ford did not report
$11,500 in campaign
contributions (including the above
mentioned $2,000 from the
banking group) when he acted as
treasurer of his own campaign.
Ford personally signed over
checks from stock brokers, an
oilman, bankers, doctors, and a
union group to Republican
Headquarters in Washington.
Two committees at the
headquarters that were run by the
same man who received the
checks then paid $12,233 of
Ford's campaign debts. Ford said
that there was no connection
between the committee that
received the money and the
committees that spent it. By this
procedure the names of the
special interest groups were not
listed in Ford's sworn campaign
report, although the money
flowed through his hands.
Patrick J. Buchanan, a special
consultant to Nixon, testified
before the Watergate committee
that his strategy was to
concentrate attacks on Senator
Muskie, then the leading
contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination. In early
1971, Buchanan asked "Who
should we get to poke the sharp
stick into his cave and bring

Muskie howling forth?"
Speaking before a group of
Jewish leaders on April 29, 1971,
Ford distorted Muskie's position
on Israel and linked Muskie with
Fulbright's anti-Zionist position in
order to accuse Muskie of
undermining American support
for Israel. Ford's speech was
viewed by observers as an attempt
to draw Jewish contributors away
from liberal Democrats.
Buchanan further testified that
Nixon's people would spur the
press to keep the Chappaquidick
incident in the public mind in
order to raise question's about
Kennedy's fitness for office.
On January 18, 1972 Ford said
that it was strange that Kennedy
would claim that the issue of
public trust in the President is
important, since that issue did
not serve Kennedy's interests.
Ford's press secretary said that
Ford's reference to trust was "an
oblique reference to
Chappaquidick."
Public Record
Gerald Ford has been a leader
in the effort to diminish the civil
liberties of Americans. He has
advocated preventive detention
and wiretapping as well as
so-called anti-riot laws designed to
limit free speech and assembly.
Ford opposed Lyndon
Johnson's 1967 proposal to ban
most public and private
wiretapping and electronic
eavesdropping. He was one of the
major proponents of legislation
that made it a crime to travel
from state to state to incite
"violence." This was the law that
was used to indict the Chicago 8
for conspiracy at the 1968
Democratic convention.
Ford was the sole sponsor of a
Nixon administration bill that
provides for pre-trial preventive
detention of so-called dangerous
persons charged with certain
crimes. Under the provisions of
the bill, a U.S. Attorney can make
a written motion to arrest
someone for the purposes of
holding a pretrial detention
hearing. A judge can hear the
motion without the accused or his
attorney being given an
opportunity to respond. Then the
judge can order the person
arrested and transported to the
place of the hearing. Once
arrested, the person may be kept
in jail for several days before the
hearing. At the hearing itself, the
usual rules of evidence in criminal
cases do not have to be adhered
to.

not serve Kennedy's interests.
Ford's press secretary said that
Ford's reference to trust was "an
oblique reference to
Chappaquidick."
Public Record
Gerald Ford has been a leader
in the effort to diminish the civil
liberties of Americans. He has
advocated preventive detention
and wiretapping as well as
so-called anti-riot laws designed to
limit free speech and assembly.
Ford opposed Lyndon
Johnson's 1967 proposal to ban
most public and private
wiretapping and electronic
eavesdropping. He was one of the
major proponents of legislation
that made it a crime to travel
from state to state to incite
"violence." This was the law that
was used to indict the Chicago 8
for conspiracy at the 1968
Democratic convention.
Ford was the sole sponsor of a
Nixon administration bill that
provides for pre-trial preventive
detention of so-called dangerous
persons charged with certain
crimes. Under the provisions of
the bill, a U.S. Attorney can make
a written motion to arrest
someone for the purposes of
holding a pretrial detention
hearing. A judge can hear the
motion without the accused or his
attorney being given an
opportunity to respond. Then the
judge can order the person
arrested and transported to the
place of the hearing. Once
arrested, the person may be kept
in jail for several days before the
hearing. At the hearing itself, the
usual rules of evidence in criminal
cases do not have to be adhered
to.
Political Positions
Ford was a spearhead of the
warhawk position on Indochina.
He was a spokesman for escalation
of the war months and sometimes
years before his suggestions

Evers & Borock

became official policy in the
Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
He was among the first to call
for direct U.S. control of all
battlefield activities (June 1964),
bombing North Vietnam (January
1965), protective reaction strikes
against missile sites and airfields
(July 1965), a naval quarantine of
North Vietnam (December 1965),
bombing Hanoi and Haiphong
(December 1965), and using
military force to close the port of
Haiphong (June 1966). Ford also
opposed holding elections in
Vietnam similar to those called
for in the Geneva accords of 1954
(June 1965).
Ford's position on the
Indochina War is just an example
of his general position in favor of
U.S. military intervention around
the world. He supported
Johnson's invasion of the
Dominican Republic in 1965 and
said afterward that "Johnson
should go even further and crack
down on Cuba."
As recently as November 7,
1973, Ford voted to sustain
Nixon's veto of the war powers
bill that designates precisely how
the President can initiate and
continue hostilities.
In light of the above facts, we
believe that the Congress should
reject the nomination of Gerald
Ford as Vice President of the
United States.
(Herb Borock and Bill Evers are
members of the Stanford
Committee to Impeach Nixon.)

The nomination of Gerald
Ford to be Vice President of the
United States gives us the
opportunity, through our elected
representatives, to pass judgment
on one of the key people who
formulated this country's foreign
and domestic policies during the
last ten years.
We have examined Ford's
record and have found that as Vice
President (or as a future
President), he would help
continue the Nixon
administration's foreign and
domestic policies. He supported
many of Nixon's positions that
have led many of us to believe
that the President should be
impeached. We have also found
that Ford has engaged in some
questionable activities during his
campaigns for Congress and
during the 1972 Presidential
election.
On one occasion, Ford received
illegal donations from two
shipping lines (the recipients of
large subsidies from the federal
government). These contributions
to Ford were part of a series for
which the shipping companies
were convicted under the Corrupt
Practices Act and fined the
maximum penalty of $50,000 in
February, 1970.
In 1972, his latest campaign,
Ford received $4,000 from a milk
producers' group and $2,500 from
a bankers' group. The bankers'
group was under investigation by
a House committee and the
Justice Department in 1970 for
attempting to influence a bank

regulation bill in Congress. That
year, Ford received $2,000 from
the same group, while other
Congressmen rejected donations
from the bankers.
Illicit Contributions
One such recent incident is
worth going into in some detail.
In 1970, Ford did not report
$11,500 in campaign
contributions (including the above
mentioned $2,000 from the
banking group) when he acted as
treasurer of his own campaign.
Ford personally signed over
checks from stock brokers, an
oilman, bankers, doctors, and a
union group to Republican
Headquarters in Washington.
Two committees at the
headquarters that were run by the
same man who received the
checks then paid $12,233 of
Ford's campaign debts. Ford said
that there was no connection
between the committee that
received the money and the
committees that spent it. By this
procedure the names of the
special interest groups were not
listed in Ford's sworn campaign
report, although the money
flowed through his hands.
Patrick J. Buchanan, a special
consultant to Nixon, testified
before the Watergate committee
that his strategy was to
concentrate attacks on Senator
Muskie, then the leading
contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination. In early
1971, Buchanan asked "Who
should we get to poke the sharp
stick into his cave and bring

Muskie howling forth?"
Speaking before a group of
Jewish leaders on April 29, 1971,
Ford distorted Muskie's position
on Israel and linked Muskie with
Fulbright's anti-Zionist position in
order to accuse Muskie of
undermining American support
for Israel. Ford's speech was
viewed by observers as an attempt
to draw Jewish contributors away
from liberal Democrats.
Buchanan further testified that
Nixon's people would spur the
press to keep the Chappaquidick
incident in the public mind in
order to raise question's about
Kennedy's fitness for office.
On January 18, 1972 Ford said
that it was strange that Kennedy
would claim that the issue of
public trust in the President is
important, since that issue did
not serve Kennedy's interests.
