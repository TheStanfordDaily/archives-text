# Emigrated Physicist Hits Soviets
## 
### EZRA GREENHOUSE 
Dr. Moshe Gitterman, a recent
Soviet emigrant to Israel and an expert
in the field of hydro-dynamics and
critical phenomena, last night urged
Americans, and scientists in particular,
to insist upon the right of Soviet
dissident scientists to correspond and
publish abroad.
"Scientific exchange and material is
essential," he said, if Soviet scientists
and society are to bfe drawn into the
international community.
Gitterman, a slender man who still
shows the effects of his June hunger
strike to dramatize the plight of Soviet
Jews who wished to emigrate,
apologized for his halting English
before briefly addressing a group of
150 people on "Science and Human
Rights in the Soviet Union." "I am a
scientist, not a politician,' he said.
The professor at Bar-Ilam
University in Ramat Gan, Israel,
described his own attempt to leave the
Soviet Union as "Kafkaesque."
He said that emigration is a
three-step process, each step increasing
in difficulty. An emigrant must first
obtain letters of recommendation
from his family, his apartment
manager and his employer.
Gitterman said that this would be
simple, were it not for the fact that
"people are afraid to help you in any
way."
Money is an even greater obstacle.
The Soviet government requires an
exit fee of 1000 rubles (approximately
$1200), and the cost of shipping
personal belongings is only slightly
less. Gitterman noted that the income
of the average Soviet citizen is about
150 rubles a month, almost two-thirds
of it spent on food.
Finally, the granting of an exit visa
is an arbitrary, and often impossible
procedure. Gitterman said that
educated Soviets are often refused
visas on grounds of "national
interest."

SOVIET-JEWISH SCIENTIST — Dr. Moshe Gitterman last night described the
plight of Soviet intellectuals who wish to leave the USSR. His Stanford
appearance was one stop in a 20-campus speaking tour.
Gitterman claimed that emigration
was a "tragic," but necessary choice
for many Soviet intellectuals. He said
that the close relationship of Soviet
leadership and citizens made useless
appeals to public opinion.
"There is no real democratic
tradition of going to the people" to
obtain individual rights, he said.
Claiming that most Soviet
intellectuals are led to "join the
leadership for financial reasons,"
Gitterman insisted that "pressure from

abroad" was essential to the struggle
of the dissident minority.
He said that the Jackson-Mills
Amendment, which forbids the
granting of most-favored nation trade
status to the Soviet Union until the
right to emigrate is assured, was an
excellent example of this pressure.
The Committee of Concerned
Scientists, which is sponsoring
Gitterman's visit, has arranged for
some 20 appearances on college
campuses and in industrial laboratories
throughout the country.

campuses and in industrial laboratories
throughout the country.
Dr. Moshe Gitterman, a recent
Soviet emigrant to Israel and an expert
in the field of hydro-dynamics and
critical phenomena, last night urged
Americans, and scientists in particular,
to insist upon the right of Soviet
dissident scientists to correspond and
publish abroad.
"Scientific exchange and material is
essential," he said, if Soviet scientists
and society are to bfe drawn into the
international community.
Gitterman, a slender man who still
shows the effects of his June hunger
strike to dramatize the plight of Soviet
Jews who wished to emigrate,
apologized for his halting English
before briefly addressing a group of
150 people on "Science and Human
Rights in the Soviet Union." "I am a
scientist, not a politician,' he said.
The professor at Bar-Ilam
University in Ramat Gan, Israel,
described his own attempt to leave the
Soviet Union as "Kafkaesque."
He said that emigration is a
three-step process, each step increasing
in difficulty. An emigrant must first
obtain letters of recommendation
from his family, his apartment
manager and his employer.
Gitterman said that this would be
simple, were it not for the fact that
"people are afraid to help you in any
way."
Money is an even greater obstacle.
The Soviet government requires an
exit fee of 1000 rubles (approximately
$1200), and the cost of shipping
personal belongings is only slightly
less. Gitterman noted that the income
of the average Soviet citizen is about
150 rubles a month, almost two-thirds
of it spent on food.
Finally, the granting of an exit visa
is an arbitrary, and often impossible
procedure. Gitterman said that
educated Soviets are often refused
visas on grounds of "national
interest."

SOVIET-JEWISH SCIENTIST — Dr. Moshe Gitterman last night described the
plight of Soviet intellectuals who wish to leave the USSR. His Stanford
appearance was one stop in a 20-campus speaking tour.
Gitterman claimed that emigration
was a "tragic," but necessary choice
for many Soviet intellectuals. He said
that the close relationship of Soviet
leadership and citizens made useless
appeals to public opinion.
"There is no real democratic
tradition of going to the people" to
obtain individual rights, he said.
Claiming that most Soviet
intellectuals are led to "join the
leadership for financial reasons,"
Gitterman insisted that "pressure from

abroad" was essential to the struggle
of the dissident minority.
He said that the Jackson-Mills
Amendment, which forbids the
granting of most-favored nation trade
status to the Soviet Union until the
right to emigrate is assured, was an
excellent example of this pressure.
The Committee of Concerned
Scientists, which is sponsoring
Gitterman's visit, has arranged for
some 20 appearances on college
campuses and in industrial laboratories
throughout the country.
