# Chile's Coup Restores Order
## Allende Violated Democracy 
### 
(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion
of a two-part series.)
4. Let us turn to the subject of international
trade. Even though the U.S. reduced to nominal
amounts its assistance and trade credits to Allende's
government, he managed to raise some $1.4 billion
in new credits. (Not an extremely effective
boycott!). About 25 percent of the new credits
came from socialist countries, although not without
string', attached. The credits had to be used in the
countries issuing them. Including the $400 million
in currency reserves which he inherited from his
predecessor, Allende had available about $1.8
billion in three years-unprecedented in Chilean
history.
5. Allende openly promoted class hatred and
warfare. As an example, he declared in late 1970
that he was not the president of all Chileans, but
only of his supporters.
Harrassment and persecution of his political
opponents were encouraged. Many were arbitrarily
fired from government and industrial positions.
There was a subtle choking and repression of the
press by physical violence, threats to cut paper
supply and financial strangulation.
All this provoked a deep hatred which prevaded
every level of society. Political opponents were
killed in the streets, factories and farms. Allende
and the government coalition used their positions
(and the generous help of Cuba, USSR and others)
to smuggle into Chile arms and equipment for an
army of 20,000 people. These included bazookas,
105 mm guns, heavy machine guns as well as small
arms of all types.
Against whom were those arms to be used? In
spite of Allende's oft voiced praise of the armed
forces and solemn declarations of unalterable
opposition to armed popular militas in Chile, his
government admitted into Chile some 13,000
foreigners who assisted in the development of
guerillas and armed popular militas.
Interventions By Castro
Official documents, shown before the U.N.
General Assembly establish the personal
intervention of Fidel Castro in Chilean internal
affairs. Castro praised Allende's efforts to gain time
to better prepare for the inevitable armed struggle.

Vinuela & Philippi

Even such a "revolutionary star" as Regis Debray
acknowledged this in London's "The Observer" in
the days following the coup.
6. Allende's government overstepped the
Constitution and violated the spirit and letter of the
law as a matter of policv. It deceived the opposition
by failing to abide by the Statute of Constitutional
Guarantees that permitted Allende to take office in
November 1970. In fact, even the übiquitousßegis
Debray reported Allende as saying that his much
publicized "respect" for the Constitution and the
law was merely a tactical step on the route to the
acquisition of total control of the country without
scaring the middle class.
Further illustration of this attitude is the
government refusal to enforce the resolutions of the
Supreme Court when they were contrary to its
political objectives. Both the Congress and the
Courts officially declared in July and August that
Allende's government was operating
unconstitutionally and illegally. Huge popular
demonstrations were demanding Allende's
resignation only six days before the coup. Only
after all thu, did the military intervene.
Workable Alternative
There are many more examples which we could
cite. Although we do not feel that a military
government is the perfect solution, it was the only
workable alternative to the imposition of a
dictatorship of the proletariat that would have been
completely alien to the Chilean tradition of orderly
progress.
We understand the frustration and anger of Cuba,
the Soviet Union and other soviet line socialist
countries at this evident failure of their strategy. We
also understand the position taken by a few people
at Stanford. It is the natural reaction of those who
never try to understand the facts, to respond
furiously when they discover that reality does not
conform to their abstract ideological molds.
It is unfortunate that many people died
(although far less than in the feverish nightmares of
Newsweek's Barnes). It is unfortunate that
democracy has temporarily vanished. But it must
not be forgotten who made this inevitable.

also understand the position taken by a few people
at Stanford. It is the natural reaction of those who
never try to understand the facts, to respond
furiously when they discover that reality does not
conform to their abstract ideological molds.
It is unfortunate that many people died
(although far less than in the feverish nightmares of
Newsweek's Barnes). It is unfortunate that
democracy has temporarily vanished. But it must
not be forgotten who made this inevitable.

of a two-part series.)
4. Let us turn to the subject of international
trade. Even though the U.S. reduced to nominal
amounts its assistance and trade credits to Allende's
government, he managed to raise some $1.4 billion
in new credits. (Not an extremely effective
boycott!). About 25 percent of the new credits
came from socialist countries, although not without
string', attached. The credits had to be used in the
countries issuing them. Including the $400 million
in currency reserves which he inherited from his
predecessor, Allende had available about $1.8
billion in three years-unprecedented in Chilean
history.
5. Allende openly promoted class hatred and
warfare. As an example, he declared in late 1970
that he was not the president of all Chileans, but
only of his supporters.
Harrassment and persecution of his political
opponents were encouraged. Many were arbitrarily
fired from government and industrial positions.
There was a subtle choking and repression of the
press by physical violence, threats to cut paper
supply and financial strangulation.
All this provoked a deep hatred which prevaded
every level of society. Political opponents were
killed in the streets, factories and farms. Allende
and the government coalition used their positions
(and the generous help of Cuba, USSR and others)
to smuggle into Chile arms and equipment for an
army of 20,000 people. These included bazookas,
105 mm guns, heavy machine guns as well as small
arms of all types.
Against whom were those arms to be used? In
spite of Allende's oft voiced praise of the armed
forces and solemn declarations of unalterable
opposition to armed popular militas in Chile, his
government admitted into Chile some 13,000
foreigners who assisted in the development of
guerillas and armed popular militas.
Interventions By Castro
Official documents, shown before the U.N.
General Assembly establish the personal
intervention of Fidel Castro in Chilean internal
affairs. Castro praised Allende's efforts to gain time
to better prepare for the inevitable armed struggle.

Vinuela & Philippi

Even such a "revolutionary star" as Regis Debray
acknowledged this in London's "The Observer" in
the days following the coup.
6. Allende's government overstepped the
Constitution and violated the spirit and letter of the
law as a matter of policv. It deceived the opposition
by failing to abide by the Statute of Constitutional
Guarantees that permitted Allende to take office in
November 1970. In fact, even the übiquitousßegis
Debray reported Allende as saying that his much
publicized "respect" for the Constitution and the
law was merely a tactical step on the route to the
acquisition of total control of the country without
scaring the middle class.
Further illustration of this attitude is the
government refusal to enforce the resolutions of the
Supreme Court when they were contrary to its
political objectives. Both the Congress and the
Courts officially declared in July and August that
Allende's government was operating
unconstitutionally and illegally. Huge popular
demonstrations were demanding Allende's
resignation only six days before the coup. Only
after all thu, did the military intervene.
Workable Alternative
There are many more examples which we could
cite. Although we do not feel that a military
government is the perfect solution, it was the only
workable alternative to the imposition of a
dictatorship of the proletariat that would have been
completely alien to the Chilean tradition of orderly
progress.
We understand the frustration and anger of Cuba,
the Soviet Union and other soviet line socialist
countries at this evident failure of their strategy. We
also understand the position taken by a few people
at Stanford. It is the natural reaction of those who
never try to understand the facts, to respond
