## Discreet, Reasonable Frats Still Exist 
### 
Before another year goes by I
must say that, in the post-mortum
examination of your itemized
Daily article, Nov. 16 should well
live on as a memorial to a badly
misdirected effort to restore
dignity to fraternity life here on
the Stanford campus. On that
date last year Sandy Genis
published a letter which cited her
opinion of a number of fraternity
men who had reportedly been
disturbing both her and other
residents of the Row houses.

Your reply, Mr. Ebner, to that
letter was neither funny nor
amusing. Beyond the laughing and
yawning you and your brothers
enjoyed as a result of an apparent
climax to the "atavistic human
ritual" that prompted the letter,
your diatribe was a sour note in
an otherwise sunny day.
Ms. Genis did not address her
letter personally to you as you
may remember; she most clearly
had only stated an objection to a
style of living-group behavior in
which she found herself included.

If you had done some serious and
informed thinking about her
message instead of attempting to
defend your fraternity against a
little embarrassment, you would
have found it unnecessary to issue
a "tiresome fusilade."
There was no basis for your
malicious remarks other than hurt
pride. And, like it or not, by your
action it was you who drowned in
that "little puddle of truculence"
you manufactured.
Irrelevant Invectives
Juvenile references to
"crabgrass," "pondwater," or
"the gratification and convenience
of a putrifving community
consience fsic|" have nothing to
do with your claim that
fraternities are a "powerless
minority in this campus. .. ."
These were just bits of "flatulent
gurgitation" you injected to side
step the issue of Ms. Genis's
observations. The legitimate
purpose of power in this country
Mr. Ebner is not to further extend
the invasion of privacy. It is to
ensure protection of the
individual from group abuses.
The United States Constitution
does not state this point directly;
but many recent cases involving
the right of privacy have been
decided in favor of the individual
by reference to constitutional
penumbras (see, eg., Grisivold us.
Conn., 1966). The same idea must
therefore also be extended to
cover minority-group infractions
on campus — whether they be by
a single individual or by an entire
fraternity.
Need I point out the stabbing
death of a Stanford student
outside Meyer library this summer
to illustrate? Yes indeed Lou.
there are "horrible" consequences
of invasion of privacy carried to
"volatile excesses" which I hope
you will find more than
intriguing.
Although you were bent on
clearing the air for your fraternity
you unfortunately did precisely
the opposite. So, lest you confuse
and corrupt the belief of the
uninitiated, may I refute your
asinine charges?
Dangerous Precedent
First, "prank" may be a
distressing noun but it is perhaps a
closer description of the incidious

J e ff Gordon

actions your fraternity practiced
than the word "ritual." Throwing
unaffiliated people in cold
showers for the "thrill of the
chase" is not too far removed
from using hot ovens for the same
purpose. Carried to excess your
behavior would bear a striking
I'semblance to the terror of
twenty nine years ago. Yours was
therefore not a matter of
cultural constipation" at all Mr.
Ebner; it is a case of personal
indiscretion.
Second, the defense of your
actions on the basis of fraternity
ritual is groundless. In the two
years I served as a ritual officer of
a large national fraternity I never
once saw a single member (myself
included) who took the archaic
ritual procedures with more than
a grain of salt. Without exception,
the members lived in either
ignorance or denial of their
professed code of ethics. I
consequently don't believe a word
you said.
Third, a simple listing of
"average hair lengths" is
insufficient evidence for
qualifying your membership as a
"little bastion of hirsuitism" sinv_e
you left out the measurement
statistics. Did you average over all
members or just two or so?
Personally, I have seldom seen
"average hair lengths" on the
order you calculated except
during the "pre-pubescent"
rock-throwing days of three years
ago. Thus, if you want to know
how to convey useful and credible
information to others, you should
learn how to estimage the
reliability of experimental data.

and Surveys,' London 1949?
Unconvincing Argument
Don't worry Lou, there's still
time to get an education. Closing
the loop on Ms. Genis by adding
insult to injury was hardly the
place to start, however. To be
truly civilized you must learn that
witty use of words can never
make up for the lack of a
convincing argument.
Bu level with me my ideal
fraternity man, is the source of
your menial disquietude really the
public exposure of your activities?
Or is in the fact that not ever
"Deific Dolly" you meet is the
"worna i of your dreams" who
carries a football in her bookbag
and squats on the scrimmage line
to launch your passes with a mug
of beor in one hand and a picture
of Norman Mailer glued behind
her ear 9
Too bad that life is not all
poker, "simple human pleasures,"
or orgasms of fraternal
self-righteousness.Those of us who
desire to cohabit the joyous realm
of reasonability in the local
community stand in awe of your
grand-mai type of impudence.

clearing the air for your fraternity
you unfortunately did precisely
the opposite. So, lest you confuse
and corrupt the belief of the
uninitiated, may I refute your
asinine charges?
Dangerous Precedent
First, "prank" may be a
distressing noun but it is perhaps a
closer description of the incidious

J e ff Gordon

actions your fraternity practiced
than the word "ritual." Throwing
unaffiliated people in cold
showers for the "thrill of the
chase" is not too far removed
from using hot ovens for the same
purpose. Carried to excess your
behavior would bear a striking
I'semblance to the terror of
twenty nine years ago. Yours was
therefore not a matter of
cultural constipation" at all Mr.
Ebner; it is a case of personal
indiscretion.
Second, the defense of your
actions on the basis of fraternity
ritual is groundless. In the two
years I served as a ritual officer of
a large national fraternity I never
once saw a single member (myself
included) who took the archaic
ritual procedures with more than
a grain of salt. Without exception,
the members lived in either
ignorance or denial of their
professed code of ethics. I
consequently don't believe a word
you said.
Third, a simple listing of
"average hair lengths" is
insufficient evidence for
qualifying your membership as a
"little bastion of hirsuitism" sinv_e
you left out the measurement
statistics. Did you average over all
members or just two or so?
Personally, I have seldom seen
"average hair lengths" on the
order you calculated except
during the "pre-pubescent"
rock-throwing days of three years
ago. Thus, if you want to know
how to convey useful and credible
information to others, you should
learn how to estimage the
reliability of experimental data.

Don't worry Lou, there's still

Before another year goes by I
must say that, in the post-mortum
examination of your itemized
Daily article, Nov. 16 should well
live on as a memorial to a badly
misdirected effort to restore
dignity to fraternity life here on
the Stanford campus. On that
date last year Sandy Genis
published a letter which cited her
opinion of a number of fraternity
men who had reportedly been
disturbing both her and other
residents of the Row houses.

Your reply, Mr. Ebner, to that
letter was neither funny nor
amusing. Beyond the laughing and
yawning you and your brothers
enjoyed as a result of an apparent
climax to the "atavistic human
ritual" that prompted the letter,
your diatribe was a sour note in
an otherwise sunny day.
Ms. Genis did not address her
letter personally to you as you
may remember; she most clearly
had only stated an objection to a
style of living-group behavior in
which she found herself included.

If you had done some serious and
informed thinking about her
message instead of attempting to
defend your fraternity against a
little embarrassment, you would
have found it unnecessary to issue
a "tiresome fusilade."
There was no basis for your
malicious remarks other than hurt
pride. And, like it or not, by your
action it was you who drowned in
that "little puddle of truculence"
you manufactured.
Irrelevant Invectives
Juvenile references to
"crabgrass," "pondwater," or
"the gratification and convenience
of a putrifving community
consience fsic|" have nothing to
do with your claim that
fraternities are a "powerless
minority in this campus. .. ."
These were just bits of "flatulent
gurgitation" you injected to side
step the issue of Ms. Genis's
observations. The legitimate
purpose of power in this country
Mr. Ebner is not to further extend
the invasion of privacy. It is to
ensure protection of the
individual from group abuses.
The United States Constitution
does not state this point directly;
but many recent cases involving
the right of privacy have been
decided in favor of the individual
by reference to constitutional
penumbras (see, eg., Grisivold us.
Conn., 1966). The same idea must
therefore also be extended to
cover minority-group infractions
on campus — whether they be by
a single individual or by an entire
fraternity.

death of a Stanford student

Before another year goes by I
must say that, in the post-mortum
examination of your itemized
Daily article, Nov. 16 should well
live on as a memorial to a badly
misdirected effort to restore
dignity to fraternity life here on
the Stanford campus. On that
date last year Sandy Genis
published a letter which cited her
opinion of a number of fraternity
men who had reportedly been
disturbing both her and other
residents of the Row houses.

Your reply, Mr. Ebner, to that
letter was neither funny nor
amusing. Beyond the laughing and
yawning you and your brothers
enjoyed as a result of an apparent
climax to the "atavistic human
ritual" that prompted the letter,
your diatribe was a sour note in
an otherwise sunny day.
Ms. Genis did not address her
letter personally to you as you
may remember; she most clearly
had only stated an objection to a
style of living-group behavior in
which she found herself included.

If you had done some serious and
informed thinking about her
message instead of attempting to
defend your fraternity against a
little embarrassment, you would
have found it unnecessary to issue
a "tiresome fusilade."
There was no basis for your
malicious remarks other than hurt
pride. And, like it or not, by your
action it was you who drowned in
that "little puddle of truculence"
you manufactured.
Irrelevant Invectives
Juvenile references to
"crabgrass," "pondwater," or
"the gratification and convenience
of a putrifving community
consience fsic|" have nothing to
do with your claim that
fraternities are a "powerless
minority in this campus. .. ."
These were just bits of "flatulent
gurgitation" you injected to side
step the issue of Ms. Genis's
observations. The legitimate
purpose of power in this country
Mr. Ebner is not to further extend
the invasion of privacy. It is to
ensure protection of the
individual from group abuses.
The United States Constitution
does not state this point directly;
but many recent cases involving
the right of privacy have been
decided in favor of the individual
by reference to constitutional
penumbras (see, eg., Grisivold us.
Conn., 1966). The same idea must
therefore also be extended to
cover minority-group infractions
on campus — whether they be by
a single individual or by an entire
fraternity.
Need I point out the stabbing
death of a Stanford student
outside Meyer library this summer
to illustrate? Yes indeed Lou.
there are "horrible" consequences
of invasion of privacy carried to
"volatile excesses" which I hope
you will find more than
intriguing.
Although you were bent on
clearing the air for your fraternity
you unfortunately did precisely
the opposite. So, lest you confuse
and corrupt the belief of the
uninitiated, may I refute your
asinine charges?
Dangerous Precedent
First, "prank" may be a
distressing noun but it is perhaps a
closer description of the incidious

J e ff Gordon

actions your fraternity practiced
than the word "ritual." Throwing
unaffiliated people in cold
showers for the "thrill of the
chase" is not too far removed
from using hot ovens for the same
purpose. Carried to excess your
behavior would bear a striking
I'semblance to the terror of
twenty nine years ago. Yours was
therefore not a matter of
cultural constipation" at all Mr.
Ebner; it is a case of personal
indiscretion.
Second, the defense of your
actions on the basis of fraternity
ritual is groundless. In the two
years I served as a ritual officer of
a large national fraternity I never
once saw a single member (myself
included) who took the archaic
ritual procedures with more than
a grain of salt. Without exception,
the members lived in either
ignorance or denial of their
professed code of ethics. I
consequently don't believe a word
you said.
Third, a simple listing of
"average hair lengths" is
insufficient evidence for
qualifying your membership as a
"little bastion of hirsuitism" sinv_e
you left out the measurement
statistics. Did you average over all
members or just two or so?
Personally, I have seldom seen
"average hair lengths" on the
order you calculated except
during the "pre-pubescent"
rock-throwing days of three years
ago. Thus, if you want to know
how to convey useful and credible
information to others, you should
learn how to estimage the
reliability of experimental data.
May I recommend: Yates,
'Sampling Methods for Censuses
and Surveys,' London 1949?
Unconvincing Argument
Don't worry Lou, there's still
time to get an education. Closing
the loop on Ms. Genis by adding
insult to injury was hardly the
place to start, however. To be
truly civilized you must learn that
witty use of words can never
make up for the lack of a
convincing argument.
Bu level with me my ideal
fraternity man, is the source of
your menial disquietude really the
public exposure of your activities?
Or is in the fact that not ever
"Deific Dolly" you meet is the
"worna i of your dreams" who
carries a football in her bookbag
and squats on the scrimmage line
to launch your passes with a mug
of beor in one hand and a picture
of Norman Mailer glued behind
her ear 9
