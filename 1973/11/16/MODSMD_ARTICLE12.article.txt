Intimidation Prevents Free Speech
Editor:
I wonder if the members of the Stanford
Community feel uncomfortable about the events
leading to the cancellation of the Chilean
government presentation scheduled for last Monday
night (Nov. 12) at Menlo College. There appears to
be no doubt that the cancellation was the result of
intimidation. It appears that this was encouraged
and/or organized by a group centered at Stanford
University.
This group has had much opportunity to present
their concept of and concern for the Chilean
situation and it has made strong use of this
opportunity. Such activity is certainly in the best
tradition of open discussion at a University. The
action of last Monday breaks sharply with that
tradition. Should intimidation be used to prevent
the presentation of an opposing point of view — no
matter how unpopular? Above all, should a
University be the base for developing such
intimidation?

• Israel Wants Peaceful Co-existence
Editor:
Dr. Marc Sapir's letter on Israel's aggressiveness
in the Daily, Nov. 12 shows a singular lack of
understanding of how equilibration is attained in a
world beset by forces pushing and pulling in various
directions. When these forces act on a country, it
must generate a counterbalancing force; the
alternative is its own annihilation. In calling for the
termination of U.S. assistance to "an aggressive
Israel,"' Dr. Sapir neglects to mention the extensive
Russian assistance to several (aggressive) Arab
countries. Surely, he cannot be calling for a purely
unilateral withdrawal of U.S. support unless he is
willing to accept the violent demise of the Jewish
state.
The fact is that for more than two decades the
official policy of most major Arab states has beer. t<
build up their forces with the express intention of

destroying the state of Israel. The well-planned Arab
attack on Yom Kippur of this year showed the
wisdom of Israel's establishing frontiers at Suez
rather than have its major population centers near
the old borders suffer direct devastation. One hopes
that the current negotiations with Egypt will give
indication of a policy change which erases the
constant threat overhanging the Israelis — at least
from that source.
Now, Dr. Sapir in his anti-Zionist zeal is
evidently bugged by the establishment of an
independent Israel in the first place, the implication
being that this move was basically an imperialistic
gambit. Many will differ with that point of view,
but to raise that issue now serves no useful purpose.
Th» same can be said for taking dated quotes, very
possibly out of context, by earlier great leaders such
as Herzl. Einstein and Weizmann. This is 1973. and
it is likely that present Israeli policy is more
strongly influenced by current position statements
of Sadat than by remarks of the aforementioned
persons.
To claim that Israel's military programs in the
face of constant extermination threats and Arab
military attacks represent instances of Israel
aggressiveness is not unlike claiming that the allies
were aggressive imperialists when invading Germany
in World War 11. Let Israel first have the
opportunity to live in harmony and friendship with
a non-threatening neighboring country and then see
whether aggression takes place.
With all its imperfections, Israel has generally
been a conspicuous example of enlightened
democracy in that part of the world. Given a
chance, its progress in economic, technical and
cultural matters and its concern for human welfare
could, on the basis of peaceful cooperation with no
military component whatever, very well serve as a
positive influence toward similar developments in
other mid-east countries. The result would be an
improved existence for the Arab people as well.
