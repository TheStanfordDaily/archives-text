Why is it that the University
will not accept post-dated checks
during advance registration? I
mean, of course, the dates marked
out later than the regular
registration day. The University
can save a lot of paperwork on
deferments and the students can
save the trouble of having to wait
in lines all over again on
registration day if post-dated
checks are accepted. Can you give
some information on how many
f,tudents defer their dues during
advance registration and how
many of these pay it on
registration daylJ.P.
Joseph Jedd, manager of
student accounting, agreed that it
would probably be more
convenient if students could
post-date checks for registration.
He said that his office would
accept post-dated checks "as a
convenience to individual
students."
Jedd was reluctant to publicize
this information becuase, as he
explained, "pre-registration is a
costly procedure for the
University" and is done for the
convenience of the students.
However, there is a "good chunk
of money that comes in early"

which compensates the University
for the expense of pre-reg.
Jedd said that if students who
would normally pay during
pre-registration defer their
payments until registration day,
the University would be "losing
the use of the money," which
would have an effect on
University budgeting.
Jedd suggested that students
who are interested in paying
registration fees with post-dated
checks call or see him in his
office. He said that if enough
people showed an interest then
some sort of policy for accepting
post-dated checks could be
formulated.
According to Jedd, about
6,000 students defer payments
during pre-registration.
Approximately 4,000 of these
students pay their fees by
registration day, he said.

Why are there never enough
Dailies? The paper goes to great
trouble to improve its coverage,
accuracy, and interest and then
defeats its purpose by failing to
print enough copies to reach any
but those who are earliest to pick
up a paper in the morning.

For example, the stack in front
of the Post Office is down to zero
copies long before noon. That
stack should be largest of all. Even
the information desk on the
second floor of Tresidder runs out
frequently. And sometimes the
Daily office itself does! —K.H.
Circulation manager Scott
Sakaguchi said that they
distribute to the 60 delivery
points on campus.
Hopefully, this means that the
most popular pickup points will
have enough papers for everyone
who wants one. Obviously, it
doesn't always work out that way
because there is a limit to the
total number of Dailies printed.
Mike Kruger, Daily business
manager, said that he is "always
anxious to improve" distribution
but is "not anxious to increase
our press run." The cost of
printing 1000 extra copies each
day (fewer than are distributed at
the Post Office now) would
effectively wipe out projected
profits for the year."
Sakaguchi suggested picking up
papers at the Math corner of the
Quad and at Tresidder. He said
that those stacks seem to last the
longest.

that those stacks seem to last the
longest.
Why is it that the University
will not accept post-dated checks
during advance registration? I
mean, of course, the dates marked
out later than the regular
registration day. The University
can save a lot of paperwork on
deferments and the students can
save the trouble of having to wait
in lines all over again on
registration day if post-dated
checks are accepted. Can you give
some information on how many
f,tudents defer their dues during
advance registration and how
many of these pay it on
registration daylJ.P.
Joseph Jedd, manager of
student accounting, agreed that it
would probably be more
convenient if students could
post-date checks for registration.
He said that his office would
accept post-dated checks "as a
convenience to individual
students."
Jedd was reluctant to publicize
this information becuase, as he
explained, "pre-registration is a
costly procedure for the
University" and is done for the
convenience of the students.
However, there is a "good chunk
of money that comes in early"

which compensates the University
for the expense of pre-reg.
Jedd said that if students who
would normally pay during
pre-registration defer their
payments until registration day,
the University would be "losing
the use of the money," which
would have an effect on
University budgeting.
Jedd suggested that students
who are interested in paying
registration fees with post-dated
checks call or see him in his
office. He said that if enough
people showed an interest then
some sort of policy for accepting
post-dated checks could be
formulated.
According to Jedd, about
6,000 students defer payments
during pre-registration.
Approximately 4,000 of these
students pay their fees by
registration day, he said.

Why are there never enough
Dailies? The paper goes to great
trouble to improve its coverage,
accuracy, and interest and then
defeats its purpose by failing to
print enough copies to reach any
but those who are earliest to pick
up a paper in the morning.

For example, the stack in front
of the Post Office is down to zero
copies long before noon. That
stack should be largest of all. Even
the information desk on the
second floor of Tresidder runs out
frequently. And sometimes the
Daily office itself does! —K.H.
Circulation manager Scott
Sakaguchi said that they
distribute to the 60 delivery
points on campus.
Hopefully, this means that the
most popular pickup points will
have enough papers for everyone
who wants one. Obviously, it
doesn't always work out that way
because there is a limit to the
total number of Dailies printed.
Mike Kruger, Daily business
manager, said that he is "always
anxious to improve" distribution
but is "not anxious to increase
our press run." The cost of
printing 1000 extra copies each
day (fewer than are distributed at
the Post Office now) would
effectively wipe out projected
profits for the year."
Sakaguchi suggested picking up
papers at the Math corner of the
Quad and at Tresidder. He said
that those stacks seem to last the
longest.
