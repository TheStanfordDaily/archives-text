# Escondido Clerk Program Ends
## 
### 
The Escondido night clerk
program, which provided residents
there with lockout and
maintenance service during
evenings and weekends, has been
discontinued because of questions
concerning how the clerks were to
be payed.
Dissatisfaction with the system
of paying the student clerks by
allowing them to live for free in
the village was expressed by clerks

Jerry and Ellen Allen, and Charles
and Lois Petersen, and by Alan A.
Cummings, manager of student
housing.
Obligated to be on duty from 5
p.m. every weekday until 8 a.m.
the next day, and 24 hours during
the weekends, the clerks said that
dividing the number of hours they
worked into their rent did not
equal the minimum wage.
Cummings cited problems with
the law covering the situation.
When the night clerk position
began, student work in return for
rent was justified, but now the
law has changed so "it isn't clear
if you can require a person to be
on duty in exchange for rent."
The night clerk program was a
part of the former Stanford
Village, and was carried over to
Escondido Village when it opened
in 1959, said Cummings.
Charles Petersen, a third-year
law student and night clerk since
May, 1971 said that when he
began there was no problem about
hours or wages. However, when
Mirrielees opened in September
1972 and the clerks found they
were expected to cover this
residence addition, they
complained to the University.
The University compromised
by allowing them to drop service
to Manzanita Park, for which they

had previously been responsible.
Later on, the University added
other tasks like cleaning out the
Escondido high-rise trash chutes
without paying them extra wages,
according to the clerks. Again
they complained, and the
University hired a contractor to
take over the trash job.
Earlier this year when the night
clerks were asked to check in late
arrivals and other work was
added, the two couples brought
up the fact that their extra hours
were not being properly
reimbursed. A couple of days later
they were informed that their jobs
had been discontinued, they said.
Petersen said he did not feel
there was any "bad faith" on the
part of the University, but said
that the administration had

previously not understood how
the law related to the Escondido
student workers.
"It was actually Cummings'
intelligence and goodwill" which
brought the problem to a head,
said Petersen. He added that
Cummings wanted as many
student jobs as possible, but when
he looked into the labor law
involved, he found discrepancies
and had to eliminate the night
clerk job.
Escondido lockout and
maintenance problems are now
being handled by the
communication center in the
Public Safety-Fire Building on the
main campus which has been
responsible for similar duties for
the rest of the student dorms.
