# Fiddler Headlines, But Doesn't Lead
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Vassar Clements is one of the
most highly respected session men
in country music. He has recorded
behind numerous artists, and was
recently awarded a gold record —
the first time in country music
history that a sideman has earned
such recognition.
Friday, Nov. 9, was Bluegrass
Night at The Great American
Music Hall with Vassar Clements
with the Caffrey Family and The
Hired Hands.
It became evident all too soon
Friday night that Clements is
destined to remain a sideman.
The Caffrey Family took the
stage with Clements hidden in the
back row, playing only short,
lyrical breaks on most songs.
It wasn't until three-fourths of
the way through the set that
Clements stepped to the front to
do some fiddling, which is what
the crowd had come to see.
Clements streaked through
impressive renditions of
"Lonesome Fiddle Blues," "Salt
River," and the inevitable
"Orange Blossom Special."
After only three songs,
Clements stopped, explaining that
he didn't know any others.
Most of the crowd probably
thought he was joking, but when
he was finally persuaded to play
some more, he could only give out
a few extra choruses of "Orange
Blossom." The rest of the evening
was an obvious letdown.
All in all, the Caffreys lacked
the vitality adherent to such local
bluegrass bands as the Phantoms
of the Opry, High Country, and
the Hired Hands.
Regulars at Paul's Saloon on
Scott St. in the Marina, the Hired
Hands consist of Marky Shubb on
mandolin, her husband Rick on
banjo, her brother, Mike Sanders,
on string bass, and Rich Wilbur on

guitar.
Starting with the Morris
Brothers standard "Salty Dog,"
the Hired Hands stuck mostly to
pure bluegrass, with Marky and
Wilbur handling most of the
singing.
The highlights of the set,
though, were the instrumental.
Marky displayed admirable
mandolin technique on "Old Joe
Clark," and Rick's banjo picking
was equally nice on "Crossing The
Cumberlands."

his West Coast premiere tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel.
