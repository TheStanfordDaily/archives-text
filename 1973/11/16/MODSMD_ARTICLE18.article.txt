# Joan Rivers' 'Insane' Comedy Accentuates Everyday Absurdities
## 
### JURGEN WOLFF 
When the events of the day are
more absurd thrn manufactured
comedy, it io difficult to be
funny. Joan Rivers does it by
focusing u r -on the small aspects of
life rather than the grand, giving
them an insane twist but still
making them ring true.
She recently exposed her
particular brand of insanity in the
Venetian Room of the Fairmont
Hotel. To this splendiferous
setting she brings a Chaplinesque
air of being a bit out of place, but
ready to bluff it out.
Appropriately, she enters in an
elegant black gown, contrasted by
a fluorescent pink ruffled stole
(made, she says, of the feathers of
106 gay chickens). Immediately
she settles down to a stool near
the edge of the stage and for the
rest of the hour it is just you and
Joan, gossiping over the back
fence.
The Joan Rivers style of
comedy is Jewish deprivation, a
female counterpart of the wit of
Woody Allen.
Many Rivers' comments

reflect the fact that her humor
has, in large measure, grown out
of her own adversities. When she
attended Barnard, she was
overweight and lonely.
Personally and professionally,
she has overcome — she is now
happily married, slim, attractive,
and a successful comedian,
author, and scriptwriter.
She has even made a success of
a fantasy she must have
entertained in her ugly duckling
days, by turning it into a movie
for television. Called "The Girl
Most Likely..it is a black

comedy tale of a ugly girl who
becomes beautiful and then
knocks off all the people who
previously shunned her. The film
was presented on ABC last week
and got the highest rating of the
season to date.
So has success spoiled Joan
Rivers? No, judging by her closing
comments at the Fairmont the
other night: "If I can make one
mother smile, one child laugh, one
shut-in sit up," she said, "and
make $10,000 in the process, then
I am a happy woman."
