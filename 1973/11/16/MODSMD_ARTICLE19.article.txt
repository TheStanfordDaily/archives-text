## 'Jacques Brel' Intoxicating 
### FRITZ SCHWENK 
A production of Jacques Brel is Alive and Well
and Living in Paris can be like a wine-tasting party
where only the best vintage wines are served but
where all the bottle-labels have been removed. In an
unpretentious way, Brel's music can so excite and
stimulate the senses that one leaves a performance
emotionally intoxicated.
The Company's production of Jacques Brel,
which opened this week at Toyon, is not such a
wine-tasting party. I'd say they're serving fresh fruit
daiquiris instead. It's a different sort of Brel than
one normally is used to seeing — perhaps less subtle,
a bit more ostentatious, and above all not naturally
fermented — but one can still leave the performance
thoroughly satisfied and a bit numbed by the whole
experience.
Certainly a large part of the success of this
production (and any Jacques Brel production, for
that matter) is the script, or should I say, score, for
Jacques Brel is a collection of songs (twenty-two in
the Company production) written by the Belgian
composer-poet Jacques Brel, who is, yes, alive and
well and living in Paris.
The show's conception and English lyrics are the
work of Mort Shuman and Eric Blau. There is no
stoiy-line to Brel, but each song is its own little
drama, and the collection of songs provides
remarkable insights not only into Jacques Brel the
artist, but also into the human condition, or as Brel
himself calls it, the "human comedy."
Ensemble Directed
One of the unique things about The Company's
Brel is their ensemble approach. The cast — Laurine

Towler, Nancy Mayans, Emily Leavitt, John
Stadelman, Marshall Watson, and David K. Miller —
as a unit directed and choreographed the show, and
everyone is on stage for the entire performance.
Although this directing approach perhaps has led to
a less polished production, it certainly has added an
enthusiasm and togetherness which the audience has
little trouble sharing.
Another strong point of this production is the
cast. I have never seen so much talent assembled in
one Stanford student production. Brel's music is
extremely demanding, and without exception the
cast handles it masterfully, faltering only perhaps in
a few of the group numbers. Highlights of the
evening were Emily Leavitt's "Old Folks," John
Stadelman's "Bachelor's Dance," and the group
number "If We Only Have Love," although it is hard
to pick out just three favorites.
Praise must also be given to Chris Lanz who
arranged and ably conducted the orchestra music.
This ten-piece musical group, built solidly around
pianist Erica Goldman, had good balance anu
complimented the singers.
If you've seen a production of Brel previously,
you may be surprised by The Company's
interpretations of some of your favorite Brel songs
(I mention in particular their staging of the usually
whimsical "Timid Frieda."), but you won't be
disappointed. If you've never seen a production of
Brel, this is a unique opportunity. This special
entertainment will be repeated tonight through
Sunday at 8 p.m. in the Toyon Lounge. Admission
is free.

composer-poet Jacques Brel, who is, yes, alive and
well and living in Paris.
The show's conception and English lyrics are the
work of Mort Shuman and Eric Blau. There is no
stoiy-line to Brel, but each song is its own little
drama, and the collection of songs provides
remarkable insights not only into Jacques Brel the
artist, but also into the human condition, or as Brel
himself calls it, the "human comedy."
Ensemble Directed
One of the unique things about The Company's
Brel is their ensemble approach. The cast — Laurine

Towler, Nancy Mayans, Emily Leavitt, John
Stadelman, Marshall Watson, and David K. Miller —
as a unit directed and choreographed the show, and
everyone is on stage for the entire performance.
Although this directing approach perhaps has led to
a less polished production, it certainly has added an
enthusiasm and togetherness which the audience has
little trouble sharing.
Another strong point of this production is the
cast. I have never seen so much talent assembled in
one Stanford student production. Brel's music is
extremely demanding, and without exception the
cast handles it masterfully, faltering only perhaps in
a few of the group numbers. Highlights of the
evening were Emily Leavitt's "Old Folks," John
Stadelman's "Bachelor's Dance," and the group
number "If We Only Have Love," although it is hard
to pick out just three favorites.
Praise must also be given to Chris Lanz who
arranged and ably conducted the orchestra music.
This ten-piece musical group, built solidly around
pianist Erica Goldman, had good balance anu
complimented the singers.
If you've seen a production of Brel previously,
you may be surprised by The Company's
interpretations of some of your favorite Brel songs
(I mention in particular their staging of the usually
whimsical "Timid Frieda."), but you won't be
disappointed. If you've never seen a production of
Brel, this is a unique opportunity. This special
entertainment will be repeated tonight through
Sunday at 8 p.m. in the Toyon Lounge. Admission
is free.
A production of Jacques Brel is Alive and Well
and Living in Paris can be like a wine-tasting party
where only the best vintage wines are served but
where all the bottle-labels have been removed. In an
unpretentious way, Brel's music can so excite and
stimulate the senses that one leaves a performance
emotionally intoxicated.
The Company's production of Jacques Brel,
which opened this week at Toyon, is not such a
wine-tasting party. I'd say they're serving fresh fruit
daiquiris instead. It's a different sort of Brel than
one normally is used to seeing — perhaps less subtle,
a bit more ostentatious, and above all not naturally
fermented — but one can still leave the performance
thoroughly satisfied and a bit numbed by the whole
experience.
Certainly a large part of the success of this
production (and any Jacques Brel production, for
that matter) is the script, or should I say, score, for
Jacques Brel is a collection of songs (twenty-two in
the Company production) written by the Belgian
composer-poet Jacques Brel, who is, yes, alive and
well and living in Paris.
