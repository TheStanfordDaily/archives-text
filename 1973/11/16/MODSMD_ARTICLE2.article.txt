# Extensive Program Planned
## Building Improvement Begins 
### BILL ROSS 
This year marks the opening phase
of an extensive building and
renovation program at Stanford,
according to Edward Shaw, executive
assistant to Provost William F. Miller.
"We are in the process of updating
the entire academic reserve," Shaw
said. "When we refer to the academic
reserve, we are speaking of 6000 of
Stanford's 8800 acres, so this is no
small project."
Renovation of the Quad,
reconstruction of the Encina East
Wing destroyed two years ago in a fire
and a major addition to the library
provide the core of the University's
plan, Shaw said.
"Our main dilemma is the lack of
money,' Shaw noted. "There is a lot
we would like to do here, but it is
difficult to raise the funds."
Shaw said the Campaign For
Stanford, attempting to raise $300
million in five years, has allocated $83
million for building projects. Although
the drive is running ahead of schedule
on endowment pledges, building
pledges are behind schedule, he added.
Budget Allocations
"Many people don't realize that the
large majority of Stanford's budget is
allocated to staff salaries, an
inflationary item," Shaw declared.
"We could improve our physical plant
by reducing the quantity and quality
of the faculty, but that would ruin the
University."
Shaw noted that protection against
earthquakes is one reason for the high
cost of construction here. Not only
must new buildings be specially built,
but older buildings such as the Quad
must be reinforced against
earthquakes.
"Although the Quad has been
strengthened many times since its
construction in the 1890 sand since
the 1906 earthquake, we plan to
reinforce it even further," Shaw
explained. "After its renovation, the
Quad will be able to withstand all but
the very worst sort of earthquake."
No New Comp Center
He said the University recently
abandoned plans for a new computer
science building, deciding instead to
move the computer science
department into the Quad.
Stanford administrators are also
planning a new engineering center,
expected to be completed by 1976,
according to Oscar Nelson, master
planner for the University.
As soon as funds are available, it

would like to construct a
nine-million-dollar chemistry building
also, he said.
Better Quarters
Nelson added that the University is
especially concerned with providing
better quarters for humanities and
social science students, Shaw stated. In
the renovated Quad, they will receive
quarters formerly occupied by the
schools of Law and Engineering.

The history comer will be
completely renovated in a project that
will take two years to complete, Shaw
said. Only the old outside walls will be
retained.
"It will be difficult to relocate the
history department during those two
years," Shaw remarked. "But the old
law quarters will accommodate most
of it." '
According to Shaw, Stanford has
no definite plans for new housing.
New Apartment Complex
The University also plans to
construct a 75-to-100 unit apartment
complex for professors emeriti, Nelson
said. It would be located on the site of
the elementary school.
Shaw noted that "retired professors
don't object to living in apartments.
We conducted a study recently that
showed that the demand for such a
complex would be overwhelming. And
we want the emeriti on campus. They
are a valuable human and intellectual
resource. They want to help us, and
we need them."

inflationary item," Shaw declared.
"We could improve our physical plant
by reducing the quantity and quality
of the faculty, but that would ruin the
University."
Shaw noted that protection against
earthquakes is one reason for the high
cost of construction here. Not only
must new buildings be specially built,
but older buildings such as the Quad
must be reinforced against
earthquakes.
"Although the Quad has been
strengthened many times since its
construction in the 1890 sand since
the 1906 earthquake, we plan to
reinforce it even further," Shaw
explained. "After its renovation, the
Quad will be able to withstand all but
the very worst sort of earthquake."
No New Comp Center
He said the University recently
abandoned plans for a new computer
science building, deciding instead to
move the computer science
department into the Quad.
Stanford administrators are also
planning a new engineering center,
expected to be completed by 1976,
according to Oscar Nelson, master
planner for the University.
As soon as funds are available, it

would like to construct a
nine-million-dollar chemistry building
also, he said.
Better Quarters
Nelson added that the University is
especially concerned with providing
better quarters for humanities and
social science students, Shaw stated. In
the renovated Quad, they will receive
quarters formerly occupied by the
schools of Law and Engineering.

The history comer will be
completely renovated in a project that
will take two years to complete, Shaw
said. Only the old outside walls will be
retained.
"It will be difficult to relocate the
history department during those two
years," Shaw remarked. "But the old
law quarters will accommodate most
of it." '
According to Shaw, Stanford has
no definite plans for new housing.
New Apartment Complex
The University also plans to
construct a 75-to-100 unit apartment
complex for professors emeriti, Nelson
said. It would be located on the site of
the elementary school.
Shaw noted that "retired professors
don't object to living in apartments.
We conducted a study recently that
showed that the demand for such a
complex would be overwhelming. And
we want the emeriti on campus. They
are a valuable human and intellectual
resource. They want to help us, and
we need them."
This year marks the opening phase
of an extensive building and
renovation program at Stanford,
according to Edward Shaw, executive
assistant to Provost William F. Miller.
"We are in the process of updating
the entire academic reserve," Shaw
said. "When we refer to the academic
reserve, we are speaking of 6000 of
Stanford's 8800 acres, so this is no
small project."
Renovation of the Quad,
reconstruction of the Encina East
Wing destroyed two years ago in a fire
and a major addition to the library
provide the core of the University's
plan, Shaw said.
"Our main dilemma is the lack of
money,' Shaw noted. "There is a lot
we would like to do here, but it is
difficult to raise the funds."
Shaw said the Campaign For
Stanford, attempting to raise $300
million in five years, has allocated $83
million for building projects. Although
the drive is running ahead of schedule
on endowment pledges, building
pledges are behind schedule, he added.
Budget Allocations
"Many people don't realize that the
large majority of Stanford's budget is
allocated to staff salaries, an
inflationary item," Shaw declared.
"We could improve our physical plant
