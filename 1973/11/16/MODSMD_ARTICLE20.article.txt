# ACT Comedy Fun, Frivolous
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
The American Conservatory Theatre's
production of You Can't Take It With You is
refreshingly easy to review. All one need do is
pull Monsieur Roget's masterpiece off of the
shelf and look up dazzling, exclamatory
synonyms for warm, witty, wild, and
wonderful. A.C.T.'s revival of this zany 1936
comedy offers a thoroughly fun evening at the
Geary Theatre.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning script, a product
of the fruitful collaboration between George
Kaufman and Moss Hart, is delightfully
crammed with bizarre characters, outrageous
happenings, and irreverent wisecracks. It deals
with the utterly non-conformist Vanderhof
family who pursue happiness to the fullest
rather than tfie dollar.
Its infectiously cheerful if somewhat
vacuous mother "writes plays because eight
years ago a typewriter was delivered here by
mistake." Its oldest daughter pursues a
belated ballet career in between making
batches of "Love Dreams" candy, despite her
Russian ballet instructor's frank appraisal that
"Confidentially, she stinks." She is forever
leaping and pirouetting about the stage with
all the delicate grace of an uncoordinated
water buffalo, usually to the accompaniment
of her husband's xylophone.
The father spends most of his time in the
basement designing and making fireworks at
all hours of the day and night, assisted by Mr.
DePinna who delivered the ice eight years ago
and just stayed. The patriarch of this unique

(even for New York City!) family just stopped
going to the office one day 35 years ago and
spends his time going to the circus and
commencements. Since ending his quest for
the dollar he has "time enough for everything
— read, talk, visit the zoo now and then,
practice my darts, even have time to notice
when spring comes around."
Political, Social Comment
The playwrights use this strangely idyllic
madness as the soapbox for their deeper
intent. Political and social comments are made
which are surprisingly appropriate today. But
mainly the laughter is aimed against
"normalcy" and the undue emphasis on
business and success. The conservative big
business element is juxtaposed to this
disorganized, chaotic family via the romantic
involvement of the son and the daughter of
each. Even this Wall Street tycoon is won
over, as is the audience, by the simple joys
which the Vanderhof family experience every
day.
Jack O'Brien's production sparkled with a
machine gun pace and tasteful inhibition. The
company exhibited a crisp and sharp ensemble
style, delivering the abundantly humorous
lines with crackeijack timing and buoyant
elan. Anne Lawder's "Penny" (the mother)
was particularly well captured, blythely
turning from her "religious play" to her "war
play" to her "sex play" and generally
spreading warmth. Joseph Bird presented a
wonderfully comic Mr. DePinna, an absolute
riot in his roman toga and tennis shoes, posing

for a portrait as a discus thrower.
The romantic scenes between a gangling
Marc Singer and two-dimensionally sweet
Deborah May as Alice didn't quite maintain
the quality of the extravagant group scenes.
Miss May had a difficult time holding her own
as a "normal person" amidst all the insanity.
A.C.T. veteran William Patterson's Grandpa
was the strongest individual performance, a
perfect mixture of the down-home
philosophizing patriarch and Yankee
individuality. He delivered his lines with an
impecable sense of timing that comes from
long experinece in the repertoire system.
Credit To Entire Company
The main glory, however, must be shared
by the company as a whole, which is as it
should be in repertoire. The set was fantastic,
as is usual with A.C.T., complementing the
eccentricity of the characters with colorful
and cluttered surroundings. The response of
the actors, each to each, was detailed and
sure. It is no coincidence that the most comic
and successful moments were those of the
frenetic group scenes and the collective
gimmicks: group sighs, smiles — the fleeting
effect of these moments of perfection cannot
be captured on paper.
You Can t Take It With You offers a case
in point of the advantages of repertoire. It
provides a philosophical comment that is still
viable and necessary today. But mostly it
provides an evening of fun, frivolity, and
smashingly good entertainment.
