# In The Color And The Noise
## Arlo Not A Kid Any Longer 
### 
Arlo Guthrie, the kid in the
funny hat on the cover of Alice's
Restaurant, has over the pasUfew
years become Arlo Guthrie,
folksinger-story teller-supers tar.
Sunday night in Berkeley, he gave
a show that was polished and
professional, but still humorous
and personal.
Half of the show was his
comments and spoken
introductions to the songs. When
some of the listeners clapped on
recognizing the opening guitar
licks of the first song, he stopped
and said "You shouldn't clap

before you hear the tune. That's
how we elected Nixon: we
clapped before we heard the
tune."
Nixon and his harass were the
subject of frequent attacks
throughout the show, but there
was more to it than politics. Early
in the first set, Guthrie sang "The
Oklahoma Hills Where I Was
Bom," and performed several
other folk songs in the style of his
father Woody.
People who came to hear "The
Alice's Restaurant Massacree"
were disappointed, but they did
get to hear another song from
about the same time, "The
Ring-Around-the-Rosie Rag,"
which included a long explanation
of the incident in a park in
Philadelphia which caused the
song to be written.
Like Randy Newman
After a song that dealt briefly
with Agnew, Guthrie went to the
piano. His style at the piano,
visually, instrumentally, and
vocally, was quite reminiscent of
Randy Newman, and I fully
expected to hear him sing the
latter's song "Sail Away," which
Guthrie backed up on Sonny
Terry and Brownie McGhee's
latest album. He didn't, however.
He did perform a Leadbelly
tune, "On a Monday," and John
Hurt's "My Creole Belle," paying
his homage to those two country

Jay Harlow

blues masters. He followed these
with his recent hit single, "City of
New Orleans," a description of a
train ride which is as good a
portrait of America as Woody's
dustbowl ballads.
Guthrie then told the audience
that he got the idea of writing a
Watergate song a long time ago,
and thought he'd make it a funny
little ragtime piece. But "the
whole thing stopped bein' funny
real quick." So, he tried to make
it a satire, but somehow that
didn't seem right. The final form,
which he played Sunday, is an
angry song in the vein of the
protest songs of the last decade:
"If you didn't know about that
one, tell me, what else don't you
know?"
'World's Getting Wierder'
The next song appeared
especially Newman-like, as he told
us that "the whole world's getting
wierder . . . just give me a hit of
my memories."
While still at the piano, Guthrie
explained that he has just been
fooling around with it for a while,
and has especially had fun with
ragtime. He proceeded to play one
of the results of his "fooling
around," which he called "Son of
Week-On-The-Rag" This was
simply one of the best rags I have
heard outside of a Scott Joplin
collection. The strong cadences
fooled the audience several times,
and toward the end each start of a
new section sent small ripples of
laughter through the crowd.
The second set opened with
Guthrie back on guitar, playing
"Ukelele Lady," followed by
"The Motorcycle Song." The
explanation of the history of this
song has changed over the years to
include The Great Banana, a
ten-foot pickle, ahd other
embellishments.
Back at the piano, he sang a
whimsical t". :o, "Me and My
Goose." During the opening
chords, he said "you'd know it
was a goose song just .by the
chords, if you was hip."
Another of his long
introductions talked of everyone
going off to Europe, and meeting
nobody there but their friends,
and deciding to head home.
Somehow or other, the way home
leads through North Africa, and
the irresistible urge to take back
some of the only stuff that's
cheaper over there.
With some hilarious comments
about the flight home across the
Atlantic and the midway paranoia
about being busted, he told of a
grand vision he had of the "100
percent dopedified American
family" and his solution to the
"dope crisis" â€” just get the whole
family together over the kitchen
table, and everybody trade your
stash for somebody else's. All of
these remarks were, of course, just
an introduction to "Coming Into
Los Angeles."
After an intense song about a
plane crash involving Mexican
deportees, Guthrie announced
that it was time for the audience
to do some singing. So, after a
short lesson on the lyrics, he
ended the set with a sing-along,
'Walkin'Down the Line."
As an encore, he did Dylan's
"Don't Think Twice," saying "I
wish I'd written this . . . maybe if
I sing it enough, everybody will
think I wrote it." He followed this
with one of Woody's songs,
"Ramblin'."
