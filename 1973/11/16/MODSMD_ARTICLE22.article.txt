# Bears Overlooking Cardinal Poloists
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
"Cal was Incredulous" the sign
read in Bovard Pool at last week's
Stanford-USC water polo game.
Indeed the Polo Bears are
disbelieving of Stanford. The
Bears have been practicing twice a
day this week in preparation for
the NCAA championships,
ignoring the Cards, their
opponents today at 3 p.m. in
Stanford's new Swim Stadium.
Of course it might be with
good reason, as the Cards have lost
to the Bears three times this
season, although only one of the
losses counted in Pacific Eight
action. California coach Pete
Cutino said, "We will have to be
in top shape for the NCAA. With
this in mind we have to work very
hard this week, and we will taper
off to one workout a day
Thanksgiving Week."
Cutino admitted that it was a
risk. "Of course this is a gamble,"
he said. "We're playing Stanford
this week more tired than usual,
and we still need to win to clinch
the conference championship
outright. There is also our rivalry
with Stanford. But in light of our

season goals, I think it's a gamble
we have to take."
The Bears are coming into
today's game with a 21-1 record.
Their only loss was to USC at
Bovard pool, 7-5. Cal defeated
UCLA twice this year, the first
time in a decade the Bears have
swept a pair from the Bruins.
Cal has five players with
international playing experience.
All-American Peter Schnugg,
Doug Arth and Jon Svendson,
competed on the U.S. National
team in Belgrade this summer
while Tom Belfanti and Doug
HeaJy competed in the World
Student Games in Moscow. The
Bears have so much depth that
Schnugg sometimes doesn't start.
This year's Polo Bears have
raised hopes of Cal winning a
NCAA championship. The Bears
have not won a title since 1968
when they won the gymnastics
title. The 1970 track and field
championship was taken away
because of eligibility infractions.
The team fills Harmon Pool when
it plays there, and people ask
Cutino for his autograph when he
strolls around Sproul Plaza.
The Cards will not be going to
Long Beach after today's game no
matter what happens. But coach
Jim Gaughran said, "I think we're
going to play a good game. I'm
sure the guys want to do a good
job. We did a fairly good job at SC
and SC beat Cal."
Gaughran didn't think that it
was automatic that the Polo Bears
would win today's game. "I don't
think it's a foregone conclusion
that Cal's going to win."
Gaughran also said that the Cards
must stop their one-quarter
letdown to win today.
Gaughran admitted that the
Bears were probably thinking
ahead a week to Long Beach
saying, "They're probably not
going to take us very seriously.
But we have beaten them in the
past.
"The thing that we need most
is a good strong game from the
goalies. Our goal tending has been
real sporadic this year."
Indeed the Card goalies will
have to play a good game, for the
Bears come into the game with a
181 goal total to their opponents
38. The Bears have been shooting
57 percent. They have also won
85 percent of their sprints.
