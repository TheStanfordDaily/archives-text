# Booters Nip Si. Patrick's
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's soccer team played
just well enough to nip stubborn
St. Patrick's College, 2-1, on
Wednesday in Mountain View.
The Cards, 10-4-2, still have an
outside chance of gaining a spot in
the NCAA playoffs.
It was one of Stanford's poorer
efforts of the season, as the
players had hoped for a big win to
enhance their playoff chances.
The team's play was not helped
by the conditions: a shoddy field
with small chuck holes and a one
degree slope, a wet surface which
provided slippery footing and an
apparently under-inflated ball
used for part of the game.
Still, both teams were stuck
with the above-mentioned
conditions, and the Cards failed to
show the superior play of which
they are capable.
Stanford went "downhill" the
first half, and controlled the
action for most of the period.
Midway through, the Cards were
awarded a direct kick near St.
Patrick's net.
Ricky Caldwell took the kick
and lofted the ball toward the net.
The St Patrick's goalie moved to
the ball and got his hands on it,
but could not prevent it from
becoming the Card's first score. It
was Caldwell's fifth goal of the
season.
Stanford held on to the 1-0
lead until halftimo, asGoalk Walt
Harris successfully guarded the
Card's net. In the second half,
Bruce Mosbacher replaced him as
goalie in order to gain experience,
for next season.
Mosbacher did an excellent
job, despite allowing the only St.
Patrick's score. Late in the game,
a St. Patrick's player took a pass
from the side and headed the ball
toward the Card's goal. The ball
hit the goalpost and bounced into
the net for a 1-1 tie.
Stanford came right back on
the next kickoff as Johnny Murao
moved the ball in, and was fouled
on the way to the.net. Tom Miller
took the ensuing penalty shot, and
drilled it into the corner of the
net to provide the winning
margin.
Miller and Mac Taylor did a
fine job on defense, making the
netminders' jobs easier. The
defensive play has been the strong
point all season as the Cards have
allowed only 20 scores in 16
contests.
The offense has produced 44
goals, but 25 of them have corrle
in three games.
The Cards will conclude regular
season play Tuesday when they
take on Westmont College in
Santa Barbara at 2 p.m. The game
was originally scheduled for
tomorrow, but Westmont
qualified for the small college
playoffs which will be going on
this weekend.
