## Zetes Vs. Biz I? 
### PETE BHATIA 
The intramural football tournament has finally reached the
semifinals and ahead in the finals a confrontation looms between the
Zetes and Biz I. This weekend, however both teams have to defeat
equally tough opponents before they can meet for the right to play
the Cal IM champion.
The Zetes will play the Phi Delts, who beat the mistake-prone
Theta Delts 13-0 yesterday. Biz I must beat the SAE's, who took Biz
II 19-6. Earlier in the week the Zetes won their way to the semis by
trouncing the Bad Guys 26-0 and Biz I advanced with a 33-14 win
over Law IV.
So, tomorrow its Biz I vs. SAE and Saturday the Zetes face the Phi
Delts. The finals will probably be played next Wednesday.
In the "B" Division semis, its KA vs. Biz II and the DU's vs. the
winner of BLSA and Zete "B."
