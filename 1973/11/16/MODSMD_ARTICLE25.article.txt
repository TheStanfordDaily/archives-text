## 
### 
Stanford's women's sports
teams were victorious in three
events held yesterday.
In swimming, the Cards
,defeated UC-Davis and
Chico State 126-31 in a double
dual meet at Davis. The winning
margin in the tight competition
against Davis came when Stanford
won the 200-yard medley, the
second to last event.
The field hockey team
improved its record to 4-0-1 with
a 6-0 victory over Cal State
Hayward on Stanford's field.
Marina Ballyntine led the scoring
with three goals. The junior
varsity defeated California, 5-0,
behind Barb Tyler's three-goal
performance.

In the free throw competition,
the final round of competition
will be held Monday night. The
six teams which have qualified
had to come through the 42-team
tournament with less than two
losses to qualify for the finals.
The final round will be
double-elimination with each man
shooting 50 throws. Those
competing are Biz I, Adelfa, Phi
Delt, Zete and Theta Delt A & B.

top-seeded DU's moved into the
semifinals with a surprisingly easy
9 & 8 win over Biz Ind I. They

semifinal, the Culos face Larkin.

The IM two-player volleyball
tournament has reached the
quarters with the top-seeded
Theta Delts still looking like the
team to beat. In the quarters they
face a tough Shakey's I team,
which breezed past Emanaon "A"
to earn its berth. Other top seeds
include last years runners-up the
.lumping Japongoes, Shakeys "A",
the Perennial Favorites, JRA and
Los Arcos.
The tourney is being
conducted on a deadline basis to
avoid conflict with the football
playoffs. The deadline for all
quarterfinal matches both "A"
and "B" division is today at 5
p.m., weather permitting.
So far in the "B" division, the
DU's are the first team to reach
the quarterfinals, having upset
third-seeded JKA 11-4, 11-1.
