# 'Little Big Game' At Berkeley
## Cards Conclude JV Season 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Stanford's junior varsity
footballers are favored to defeat
the California JV when they close
out their season at Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium today at 2 p.m.
Coach Gunther Cunningham
expects to meet a Cal team better
than the USC squad Stanford
trounced 41-10 a week ago (Cal
beat SC, 28-23) but not nearly as
good as the UCLA team to which
Stanford lost, 24-13, after
dominating the game.
The Bears, 3-1 like the Cards,
were crushed by the Brubabes,
55-14, after what Cunningham
says were "a lot of turnovers." Cal
ran up 409 yards total offense
against the Trobabes, so
Cunningham expects "a lot of
offense" on its part today.
Cunningham fears Cal's "four
big defensive lineman," in

particular Craig Peters (sought
after by Stanford) and Stanley
Cotton, and the passing
combination of quarterback
Maurice Hamilton and tight end
Seth Fogel. But, the coach
confesses, "I don't know what
they're gonna do."
Split Play-Calling
Freshman Mike Cordova again
will start at quarterback for the
Cardinals, and Cunningham says
he's "gonna give him [Cordova] a
chance" to break his mark of 292
passing yards set against the
Trobabes. He and Cordova will
probably split the play-calling, the
coach says, but "if he gets hot,
he'll call 'em."
Defensive noseguard Art
Estrada has moved to the varsity
after a great game against USC, so
Greg Dowson, Duncan McColl and
Mike Cummins will start, at the
up-front spots in Stanford's 50
defense.
Rick Brand and John Maynard
will start as outside linebackers
for Stanford. Roger Greer, who
held one of those spots before
being injured against UC-Davis,
has a "very bad pinched nerve,"
Cunningham says, and won't be
back until spring.
Doesn't Fear Letdown
Cunningham doesn't fear a
letdown today after his squad's
sky-high temperament for its win
over USC. Tuesday was
"emotionally our best practice of
the year," he said. "They're really
excited about Cal.
"We've got everything together
— we want to keep it going. Our
football program is really on the
way back. It won't be too long
before Stanford is in the Rose
Bowl."

Cunningham said Cordova and
three of his receivers, Dave Nagler,
Jim Jenke and Jim Erickson, were
his outstanding offensive stars
against SC, along with fullback
Don Stevenson, whom he called
"a running back prospect for the
varsity."
"I don't know if names are
necessary, really," to pick out top
defensemen against the Trobabes,
Cunningham said. He did mention
safety Rich Waters and linebacker
Mark Sasina, whom he said "put it
all together. He looks like a
linebacker possibility for the
varsity. He brought the younger
kids on and really gave leadership
in L.A."

against the Trobabes, so
Cunningham expects "a lot of
offense" on its part today.
Cunningham fears Cal's "four
big defensive lineman," in

particular Craig Peters (sought
after by Stanford) and Stanley
Cotton, and the passing
combination of quarterback
Maurice Hamilton and tight end
Seth Fogel. But, the coach
confesses, "I don't know what
they're gonna do."
Split Play-Calling
Freshman Mike Cordova again
will start at quarterback for the
Cardinals, and Cunningham says
he's "gonna give him [Cordova] a
chance" to break his mark of 292
passing yards set against the
Trobabes. He and Cordova will
probably split the play-calling, the
coach says, but "if he gets hot,
he'll call 'em."
Defensive noseguard Art
Estrada has moved to the varsity
after a great game against USC, so
Greg Dowson, Duncan McColl and
Mike Cummins will start, at the
up-front spots in Stanford's 50
defense.
Rick Brand and John Maynard
will start as outside linebackers
for Stanford. Roger Greer, who
held one of those spots before
being injured against UC-Davis,
has a "very bad pinched nerve,"
Cunningham says, and won't be
back until spring.
Doesn't Fear Letdown
Cunningham doesn't fear a
letdown today after his squad's
sky-high temperament for its win
over USC. Tuesday was
"emotionally our best practice of
the year," he said. "They're really
excited about Cal.
"We've got everything together
— we want to keep it going. Our
football program is really on the
way back. It won't be too long
before Stanford is in the Rose
Bowl."

Cunningham said Cordova and
three of his receivers, Dave Nagler,
Jim Jenke and Jim Erickson, were
his outstanding offensive stars
against SC, along with fullback
Don Stevenson, whom he called
"a running back prospect for the
varsity."
"I don't know if names are
necessary, really," to pick out top
defensemen against the Trobabes,
Cunningham said. He did mention
safety Rich Waters and linebacker
Mark Sasina, whom he said "put it
all together. He looks like a
linebacker possibility for the
varsity. He brought the younger
kids on and really gave leadership
in L.A."
Stanford's junior varsity
footballers are favored to defeat
the California JV when they close
out their season at Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium today at 2 p.m.
Coach Gunther Cunningham
expects to meet a Cal team better
than the USC squad Stanford
trounced 41-10 a week ago (Cal
beat SC, 28-23) but not nearly as
good as the UCLA team to which
Stanford lost, 24-13, after
dominating the game.
The Bears, 3-1 like the Cards,
were crushed by the Brubabes,
55-14, after what Cunningham
says were "a lot of turnovers." Cal
ran up 409 yards total offense
against the Trobabes, so
Cunningham expects "a lot of
offense" on its part today.
