# Cards Seek New Goals Against Sinking Ducks
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's Cardinals, now
mathematically eliminated from
Rose Bowl contention, take the
Geld against Oregon tomorrow in
search of more mundane goals.
Goals like a winning season,
clinching a first division finish in
the Pac-8 race and bettering last
year's 6-5 record — objectives that
aren't nearly as motivating as a
New Year's Day trip to Pasadena
but should nevertheless keep the
Cards inspired through the last
two weeks of the season.
"We know that we can finish
with a better record than a year
ago with two closing wins," said
coach Jack Christiansen. "No one
has to remind us about that."
If the Cards beat the Ducks in
tomorrow's 1:30 p.m. game,
Stanford will be assured of its
sixth consecutive winning season.
The Cards haven't had a losing
campaign sinje 1963, John
Ralston's first year at the Farm. A
Stanford victory would also keep
ihe Cards in the upper division of
the Pac-8, no matter what
happens next week.
Can 'Beat Anyone'
Those factors, plus
Christiansen's feeling that Oregon

is "capable of beating anyone,"
should get the Cards ready for a
Duck team that held UCLA to
just six points in the first half last
week before losing 27-7.
"It's very discouraging to come
close and lose," said Oregon coach
Dick Enright. "There hasn't been
a game this year that we haven't
been in all the way. We've just
taken ourselves out of some with
our own mistakes."
Oregon is 2-5 in the
conference and 2-7 on the season,
but the two victories were
impressive. The Ducks romped
past California 41-10 and
destroyed Washington 58-0.
The Webfoots are led by
tailback Don Reynolds, who
currently trails only UCLA's
Kermit Johnson in the Pac-8
rushing charts with 853 yards in
nine games. Tight end Russ
Francis (26 receptions for 453
yards) and quarterback Herb
Singleton(lls7 yards passing) are
the other big names on the Duck
offensive unit.
Rugged Defense
Defensively, tackle Reggis
Lewis leads the team with 78
tackles, including 12 quarterback
sacks. Free safety Steve Donnelly,
who has five interceptions and has
tackled 25 enemy ballcarriers in
one game against Washington
State, holds the defensive
secondary intact.
"Our big jobs will be to stop
Reynolds," Christiansen said,
"and to contain their blitz. They
do a good job of putting pressure
on the quarterback."
Outside linebacker Geb Church
won't start for the Cards
tomorrow because of a torn
tendon in his finger. Church is
scheduled for surgery and will be
out for the remainder of the
season. Terry Pape will replace
Church in the starting lineup, with
Mike Yancey moving up from the
junior varsity to back him up.
Oddsmakers have installed the
Cards as five-point favorites for
the contest. A crowd of 45,000 is
expected for the 1:30 p.m.
kickoff.

Cardinal Notes: Enright said
Wednesday that starting defensive
end Keith Davis definitely won't
play tomorrow because of an
injured ankle. Strong safety
Reggie Grant is the only other
Duck listed as "doubtful."
Stanford lost last year's game
15-13 when Reynolds scampered
85 yards across Antzen Stadium's
soggy artificial turf for the
winning touchdown. The Cards
lead the series, 26-14-1.
Two Stanford ,
coaches, defensive backfield coach
George Seifert and junior varsity
coach Gunther Cunningham,
formerly worked on the Oregon
staff. "What scares me," said
Enright, "is that we have a couple
of ex-Oregon coaches down there
who are going to find some way
to get them up for us."
Ticket manager Bette
Robertson said that last week's
student ticket confusion at USC
was due to a mixup in the Trojan
ticket office. Ushers at the game
told Stanford students that the
Stanford athletic department
oversold, but Robertson said that
only the allotted number of
tickets were sold.

year's 6-5 record — objectives that
aren't nearly as motivating as a
New Year's Day trip to Pasadena
but should nevertheless keep the
Cards inspired through the last
two weeks of the season.
"We know that we can finish
with a better record than a year
ago with two closing wins," said
coach Jack Christiansen. "No one
has to remind us about that."
If the Cards beat the Ducks in
tomorrow's 1:30 p.m. game,
Stanford will be assured of its
sixth consecutive winning season.
The Cards haven't had a losing
campaign sinje 1963, John
Ralston's first year at the Farm. A
Stanford victory would also keep
ihe Cards in the upper division of
the Pac-8, no matter what
happens next week.
Can 'Beat Anyone'
Those factors, plus
Christiansen's feeling that Oregon

is "capable of beating anyone,"
should get the Cards ready for a
Duck team that held UCLA to
just six points in the first half last
week before losing 27-7.
"It's very discouraging to come
close and lose," said Oregon coach
Dick Enright. "There hasn't been
a game this year that we haven't
been in all the way. We've just
taken ourselves out of some with
our own mistakes."
Oregon is 2-5 in the
conference and 2-7 on the season,
but the two victories were
impressive. The Ducks romped
past California 41-10 and
destroyed Washington 58-0.
The Webfoots are led by
tailback Don Reynolds, who
currently trails only UCLA's
Kermit Johnson in the Pac-8
rushing charts with 853 yards in
nine games. Tight end Russ
Francis (26 receptions for 453
yards) and quarterback Herb
Singleton(lls7 yards passing) are
the other big names on the Duck
offensive unit.
Rugged Defense
Defensively, tackle Reggis
Lewis leads the team with 78
tackles, including 12 quarterback
sacks. Free safety Steve Donnelly,
who has five interceptions and has
tackled 25 enemy ballcarriers in
one game against Washington
State, holds the defensive
secondary intact.
"Our big jobs will be to stop
Reynolds," Christiansen said,
"and to contain their blitz. They
do a good job of putting pressure
on the quarterback."
Outside linebacker Geb Church
won't start for the Cards
tomorrow because of a torn
tendon in his finger. Church is
scheduled for surgery and will be
out for the remainder of the
season. Terry Pape will replace
Church in the starting lineup, with
Mike Yancey moving up from the
junior varsity to back him up.
Oddsmakers have installed the
Cards as five-point favorites for
the contest. A crowd of 45,000 is
expected for the 1:30 p.m.
kickoff.

with a better record than a year
ago with two closing wins," said
coach Jack Christiansen. "No one
has to remind us about that."
If the Cards beat the Ducks in
tomorrow's 1:30 p.m. game,
Stanford will be assured of its
sixth consecutive winning season.
The Cards haven't had a losing
campaign sinje 1963, John
Ralston's first year at the Farm. A
Stanford victory would also keep
ihe Cards in the upper division of
the Pac-8, no matter what
happens next week.
Can 'Beat Anyone'
Those factors, plus
Christiansen's feeling that Oregon

is "capable of beating anyone,"
should get the Cards ready for a
Duck team that held UCLA to
just six points in the first half last
week before losing 27-7.
"It's very discouraging to come
close and lose," said Oregon coach
Dick Enright. "There hasn't been
a game this year that we haven't
been in all the way. We've just
taken ourselves out of some with
our own mistakes."
Oregon is 2-5 in the
conference and 2-7 on the season,
but the two victories were
impressive. The Ducks romped
past California 41-10 and
destroyed Washington 58-0.
The Webfoots are led by
tailback Don Reynolds, who
currently trails only UCLA's
Kermit Johnson in the Pac-8
rushing charts with 853 yards in
nine games. Tight end Russ
Francis (26 receptions for 453
yards) and quarterback Herb
Singleton(lls7 yards passing) are
the other big names on the Duck
offensive unit.
Rugged Defense
Defensively, tackle Reggis
Lewis leads the team with 78
tackles, including 12 quarterback
sacks. Free safety Steve Donnelly,
who has five interceptions and has
tackled 25 enemy ballcarriers in
one game against Washington
State, holds the defensive
secondary intact.
"Our big jobs will be to stop
Reynolds," Christiansen said,
"and to contain their blitz. They
do a good job of putting pressure
on the quarterback."
Outside linebacker Geb Church
won't start for the Cards
tomorrow because of a torn
tendon in his finger. Church is
scheduled for surgery and will be
out for the remainder of the
season. Terry Pape will replace
Church in the starting lineup, with
Mike Yancey moving up from the
junior varsity to back him up.
Oddsmakers have installed the
Cards as five-point favorites for
the contest. A crowd of 45,000 is
expected for the 1:30 p.m.
kickoff.

Cardinal Notes: Enright said
Wednesday that starting defensive
end Keith Davis definitely won't
play tomorrow because of an
injured ankle. Strong safety
Reggie Grant is the only other
Duck listed as "doubtful."
Stanford lost last year's game
15-13 when Reynolds scampered
85 yards across Antzen Stadium's
soggy artificial turf for the
winning touchdown. The Cards
lead the series, 26-14-1.
Two Stanford ,
coaches, defensive backfield coach
George Seifert and junior varsity
coach Gunther Cunningham,
formerly worked on the Oregon
staff. "What scares me," said
Enright, "is that we have a couple
of ex-Oregon coaches down there
who are going to find some way
to get them up for us."
Ticket manager Bette
Robertson said that last week's
student ticket confusion at USC
was due to a mixup in the Trojan
ticket office. Ushers at the game
told Stanford students that the
Stanford athletic department
oversold, but Robertson said that
only the allotted number of
tickets were sold.
In case you've been wondering

on the road ... the Cards are

attendance with a 51,875 average.

the league in first downs, but are

TRAVELING MAN — Oregon quarterback Herb Singleton (15)
enrolled at Oregon last spring after spending time at Compton Junior
College, Texas-El Paso and Lane College in Eugene. Now comfortably
settled with the Ducks, Singleton has completed 90 of 190 passes for
1157 yards since taking over as the number-one quarterback.
Stanford's Cardinals, now
mathematically eliminated from
Rose Bowl contention, take the
Geld against Oregon tomorrow in
search of more mundane goals.
Goals like a winning season,
clinching a first division finish in
the Pac-8 race and bettering last
year's 6-5 record — objectives that
aren't nearly as motivating as a
New Year's Day trip to Pasadena
but should nevertheless keep the
Cards inspired through the last
two weeks of the season.
