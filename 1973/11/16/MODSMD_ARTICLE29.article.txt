# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
While USC and UCLA use
Washington and Oregon State
as tackling dummies to prepare
for their Nov. 24 showdown,
the remaining four Pacific
Eight teams continue their
battle to finish in the first
division.
Stanford (3-2) can clinch a
first division spot by defeating
Oregon (2-3) here at Stanford
Stadium, and the Daily's
prognosticator predicts a
narrow Cardinal victory.
Stanford should prevail by two
or three of those wonderful
Rod Garcia field goals, assuring
the Cards of their sixth straight
winning season and
entrenching Garcia even more
securely in the NCAA record
books.
In snowy Pullman, another
first division spot is at stake as

California (2-3) meets
Washington State (2-3). The
Cougar ground game should
keep the Bears frostbitten.
USC, of course, will have
little trouble with Washington,
even though the Huskies are
slightly rejuvenated after
rolling past Idaho last week.
UCLA's Wishbone should plow
right over Oregon State's
Beavers as tailback Kermit
Johnson continues his climb on
the all-time Pac-8 rushing list.
Johnson is currently sixth with
2,339 career yards.
The Daily, after a 4-1
performance last weekend, is
now 29-6-1 on the season.
