# More Conservative Leaning Possible
## Proposal May Shift Faculty Makeup 
### JOHN FREED 
The Academic Council could
become dramatically "more
conservative" if a controversial
recommendation from the Medical
School Faculty Senate is implemented,
according to Lee Herzenberg, a
research associate at the Medical
Center.
The proposal would create a new
faculty position, "clinical professor," a
non-tenured position with voting
rights on the Academic Council.
"Most of the appointments will be
made in radiology, surgery, or
anesthesia. These are conservative
disciplines, generally supporting the
Administration. Their colleagues [in
other departments], on the other
hand, have a history of opposing the

administration on key votes,"
Herzenberg claimed.
The clinical professor will have
status similar to that of an assistant
professor. The crucial difference
centers around tenure.
Assistant professors must receive
tenure within six years of their
appointment, or else leave the
University. Clinical professors,
however, will not receive tenure,
according to Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School.
"They are term [not tenure]
appointments. The term in the
appointment we now make is usually
six years, but it varies," Rich stated.
Approximately 20 persons already
take on the responsibilities of a clinical
professor, a title that Rich hopes will

be made "Associate Professor at..
the name of the hospital where the
professor works. Rich expects about
80 persons to hold clinical
professorships within a decade.
"We project, at the end of ten
years, there might be up to 80 people
in that faculty line. There are about 20
now," Rich stated.
"The Med School has the
responsibility to take care of patients
and to teach the students. The
teachers don't have time to do
research," he claimed. "There is a need
to train more doctors due to the
so-called 'crisis in health care.' "
Because the appointees will face
contract renewals every few years,
they will tend to vote more
conservatively, Herzenberg also
alleged.
"Some assistant professors on the
Academic Council don't vote on
touchy issues when they're up for
tenure [after seven years]. So clinical
professors most likely will be cautious
for the last two years of their
contract," she asserted.
The situation arose because of a
squeeze on the time of persons who
teach and do clinical work. These
persons generally do not have enough
free time to meet minimum University
standards for completion of research
work.

responsibility to take care of patients

She hinted that the Administration
might pressure these clinical professors

into siding with them under threat of
non-renewal of contracts.
The Med School Senate's proposal
is currently being reviewed by the
Committee on the Professoriate. The
committee's chairman, Colin
Pittendrigh, declined to comment on
the current status of the idea.
"We're due to report to the
[Faculty] Senate at the end of this
quarter, probably at the January 10
meeting. We're at the stage now when
we're polishing the report. It's quite
possible that several major changes will
occur in the next few months,"

anesthesia. These are conservative
disciplines, generally supporting the
Administration. Their colleagues [in
other departments], on the other
hand, have a history of opposing the

administration on key votes,"
Herzenberg claimed.
The clinical professor will have
status similar to that of an assistant
professor. The crucial difference
centers around tenure.
Assistant professors must receive
tenure within six years of their
appointment, or else leave the
University. Clinical professors,
however, will not receive tenure,
according to Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School.
"They are term [not tenure]
appointments. The term in the
appointment we now make is usually
six years, but it varies," Rich stated.
Approximately 20 persons already
take on the responsibilities of a clinical
professor, a title that Rich hopes will

be made "Associate Professor at..
the name of the hospital where the
professor works. Rich expects about
80 persons to hold clinical
professorships within a decade.
"We project, at the end of ten
years, there might be up to 80 people
in that faculty line. There are about 20
now," Rich stated.
"The Med School has the
responsibility to take care of patients
and to teach the students. The
teachers don't have time to do
research," he claimed. "There is a need
to train more doctors due to the
so-called 'crisis in health care.' "
Because the appointees will face
contract renewals every few years,
they will tend to vote more
conservatively, Herzenberg also
alleged.
"Some assistant professors on the
Academic Council don't vote on
touchy issues when they're up for
tenure [after seven years]. So clinical
professors most likely will be cautious
for the last two years of their
contract," she asserted.
The situation arose because of a
squeeze on the time of persons who
teach and do clinical work. These
persons generally do not have enough
free time to meet minimum University
standards for completion of research
work.

might pressure these clinical professors

into siding with them under threat of
non-renewal of contracts.
The Med School Senate's proposal
is currently being reviewed by the
Committee on the Professoriate. The
committee's chairman, Colin
Pittendrigh, declined to comment on
the current status of the idea.
"We're due to report to the
[Faculty] Senate at the end of this
quarter, probably at the January 10
meeting. We're at the stage now when
we're polishing the report. It's quite
possible that several major changes will
occur in the next few months,"
Pittendrigh noted.
The Academic Council could
become dramatically "more
conservative" if a controversial
recommendation from the Medical
School Faculty Senate is implemented,
according to Lee Herzenberg, a
research associate at the Medical
Center.
The proposal would create a new
faculty position, "clinical professor," a
non-tenured position with voting
rights on the Academic Council.
