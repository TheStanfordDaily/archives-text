# Inconsistency Hurts Cagers
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity cagers
stumbled through their worst
scrimmage of the year as bub
Bowling's Whites outlasted Billy
Jones' Reds 73-62 before 37
partisan fans Wednesday night in
Maples Pavilion.
"We are still inconsistent,",.,
lamented head coach Howie-*
Dallmar after the scrimmjger~
Dallmar pointed to numerous *
turnovers and mental errors as the
major difficulties.
Sophomore post man Ed
Schweitzer led all scorers with 20
points to lead the Whitqs to
victory. Junior forward Scott
Trobbe chipped in 13 points and
six rebounds, and center Rich
Kelley added 11 points and, as
usual, led all re bounders with 12.
Forward Dave Frost led Red
scorers with 19 points, while 6-1
senior guard Jim Montague turned
in another fine performance with
18. Senior post man Mike Mann
(6-9) is fully recovered from
early-season knee surgery, and in
his second full scrimmage of the
year scored nine points and snared
eight rebounds.
The Cards will have another
game-type scrimmage tomorrow
morning at 9:30 at Maples.
