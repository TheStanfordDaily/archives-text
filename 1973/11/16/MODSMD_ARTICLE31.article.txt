# NCAA Cross Country Meet
## Sandoval Awaits Biggest Challenge 
### MARK WHITE 
When the best long distance runners in the
country line up for the NCAA Cross Country
Championships Monday in Spokane,
Washington, one skinny 120 pound
sophomore from Los Alamos, New Mexico
will be'the sole representative from Stanford.
In a meet that should be dominated by
Western powers like Washington State and
Oregon, and by Eastern teams like Tennessee
and Villanova, one of the few representatives
from a Southern Pac-8 school will be Cardinal
Tony Sandoval.
In only his second season of collegiate
competition, Sandoval has already established
himself as the best cross country runner in the
school's history. Three weeks ago the
unobtrusive Sandoval won the Southern
Division Pac-8 championship race with a
record breaking 29:03, five seconds better
than the old Stanford standard for the
challenging six-mile course.
Two weeks later, in the Pac-8
championships, Tony was' the only runner
placing in the top 10 (he placed ninth) who
was not from a Northern Pac-8 school. As
they are expected to do in Spokane, WSU and
Oregon battled for the league championship,
as both schools grabbed eight of the top 10
places.
For some runners, victory is the height of
ecstacy; defeat the depths of depravity.
Outwardly this is not so in the case of
Sandoval. Other members of the Stanford
team seemed more excited by Tony's record
feat than the record-holder himself. "I just
came to run," Sandoval softly remarked, "and
I felt pretty good." His response was the same
in its temper following the relatively
disappointing ninth place finish in the finals.
"I was out there to run and I didn't run my
best."
Why does he run? Sandoval himself is not
sure. "I run, I guess, because it's good, healthy

and fun. It seems better than coming back to
the house [Thelta Delta Chi] and doing
nothing. I'm always looking forward to racing
— just going against a new group of guys is
fun.
Much of Sandoval's pleasure is grounded in
competition and victory. "I'm pretty happy
when I win, if I've run a good race. A good
race is not constituted by simply winning; it
depends whether you put out or not. You
don't relax in a good race, you don't relax.
"If 1 win, I'm usually glad I finished at all.
Then I think of the race and what happened.
Then I like to congratulate Coach [ Marshall |

Clark; I don't think ho gets enough
recognition."
Sandoval didn't start running until his
sophomore year in high school. "Rick Rojas, a
riendof mine who is now running for Harvard,
came to me about, two weeks before school
started, and showed me this running shoe
order form and said, 'Let's run cross country.'
I've run ever since."
New Mexico Records
In his sophomore year, "Sandy" was
undefeated going into the state championship.
When he had graduated from high school, he
held both the New Mexico records for the
three-mile and track two-mile runs. He then
gained national reknown with a record victory
over Craig Virgin in the Junior National Finals
of the 5000 meter run.
Tony, a probable mechanical engineering
major, prefers not to make long range plans.
"Right now I'm just aiming towards this
Monday's meet. But I don't plan too much
further into the future. I would like to get
into better shape next year. My main goal is
to improve. But I rarely shoot for any goal
when I m in the middle of a season; I try to
take each race as it comes and not wear
myself down thinking about some long range
goal.
"Running is probably 10 percent physical
and 90 percent mental. To run well you have
to be able to concentrate and relax at the
same time. If you don't take it a race at at
ime, you get mentally fatigued and then
you've lost your mental toughness that you'
have to have to win.
"Since he's won it twice, since he's gone to
the Olympics and since he has the experience,
I'd have to say |Steve| Prefontaine is the
favorite. But if Pre has a bad race, none of the
other guys are going to sit back and wait. As
for myself, I just don't want to get buried in
the pack. I'm just going to go ouKhere to run
and do my best."
