Senate Defeats Rationing Move
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday defeated a
Democratic move to require President Nixon to order gas
rationing by Jan. 15 and then adopted an amendment its
sponsor said could slow clean air efforts by two years.
The clean air amendment to emergency energy
legislation, would allow temporary suspension of emission
standards in order to permit the burning of dirtier fuels.
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, the sponsor, said it
would "assure minimum disruption of air quality
programs," but acknowledged that it could "in some
instances delay the achievement of the emission reduction
goals of the Clean Air Act by two years." It passed
overwhelmingly.
The emission standards suspension is one of several
powers Nixon says he needs to meet the energy crisis.
Egypt, Israel Exchange POW's
Prisoners of war came home to Israel and Egypt
yesterday.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, on hand to
welcome returnees to Tel Aviv, declared: "At last we have
arranged things by talks, like human beings, instead of by
tank fire and exploding grenades."
The first Red Cross planes carried wounded prisoners,
some walking and some on stretchers. The International
Red Cross said it expected the full exchange to take about
a week.
In Cairo informants reported a major shakeup in the
Egyptian military high command following Israel's
lightning break through Egypt's Suez line in the last 10
days of the October war.
They said the military calamity, which left the
Egyptian 3rd Army cut off in the Sinai Desert, had
resulted in the tiring of at least one army chief and
creation of a new field command. Observers foresaw the
possibility of court-martial trials in the wake of the failure
to follow up an initial Egyptian success.
Connally Denies Bribery Charge
WASHINGTON — Former Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally denied emphatically last night that he ever
accepted money for his help in arranging higher federal
support prices for the nation's dairy industry.
Connally emerged from a closed-door interrogation
session with Senate Watergate committee lawyers and told
reporters, "anyone that supposes he was present when I
received a payment is a categorical liar."
Connally who said he does not expect to be called as a
witness when the committee opens public hearings into
the so-called milk deal later this month, acknowledged he
had favored higher dairy prices.
Connally said the committee lawyers questioned him
about published reports, denied by Connally, that he
received $15,000 for his role in the decision to approve
higher price supports.

Crisis Pinches Public Transit
Fuel allocations are beginning to pinch public
transportation in several of the nation's cities, and more
transit agencies expect cuts in December unless they get
additional supplies.
The shortage is forcing some companies to search for
alternate sources of fuel supply, often at higher prices,
and to develop contingency plans for service cuts.
"The irony of this is if we're going to have gasoline
rationing, and public transportation is cut back, what are
people going to do?" asked Forrest I. Neal, presiding
officer of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority.
The MBTA, which operates buses, subways and trolleys
in the Boston area, says it will start cutting service Dec. 1
if it doesn't find new sources of fuel.
Skylab Set For Launch
CAPE CANAVERAL — The Skylab 3 astronauts took
a final jaunt around South Florida in T3B jets yesterday
to hone their flying skills and help ward off motion
sickness when they blast off for America's orbiting
laboratory today.
William C. Schneider, Skylab program director, said at
a prelaunch briefing yesterday afternoon: "We are now go
for launch at 6:01 a.m. PST today. All of our inspections
and analyses have confirmed that the bird is ready for
flight. I see no reason why we can't go the full 84 days."
Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue and
Edward G. Gibson will spend 84 days aboard the orbiting
scientific laboratory.
Stanford Grad Leads Golf Tourney
PINEHURST, N.C. — Stanford graduate student and
tournament leader Tom Watson blew to a fat,
five-over-par 76 and opened the gate to a stunning charge
by rookie Ben Crenshaw yesterday in the sixth round of
the $500,000 World Open Golf Tournament, the richest
such event ever staged.
The 21-year-old Crenshaw, winner of the San Antonio
Open two weeks ago, came from 18 strokes back with an
eye-popping seven-under-par 64 in dusty, swirling winds
and moved to within six strokes of the lead.
Watson, who matched the course record on the
7,007-yard No. 2 course at the Pinehurst Country Club
with a 62 in Wednesday's fifth round, soared 14 strokes
higher with wildly erratic play that included an eagle, two
birdies, five bogeys and a triple bogey seven.
Today's Weather
Rain and snow are forecast Friday for Northern
California as another cold front moves southward through
the state, the weatherman said.
Highs will reach the 50s to mid 60s today but the
passage of the front will mean slightly cooler temperatures
tomorrow.

session with Senate Watergate committee lawyers and told
reporters, "anyone that supposes he was present when I
received a payment is a categorical liar."
Connally who said he does not expect to be called as a
witness when the committee opens public hearings into
the so-called milk deal later this month, acknowledged he
had favored higher dairy prices.
Connally said the committee lawyers questioned him
about published reports, denied by Connally, that he
received $15,000 for his role in the decision to approve
higher price supports.

Crisis Pinches Public Transit
Fuel allocations are beginning to pinch public
transportation in several of the nation's cities, and more
transit agencies expect cuts in December unless they get
additional supplies.
The shortage is forcing some companies to search for
alternate sources of fuel supply, often at higher prices,
and to develop contingency plans for service cuts.
"The irony of this is if we're going to have gasoline
rationing, and public transportation is cut back, what are
people going to do?" asked Forrest I. Neal, presiding
officer of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority.
The MBTA, which operates buses, subways and trolleys
in the Boston area, says it will start cutting service Dec. 1
if it doesn't find new sources of fuel.
Skylab Set For Launch
CAPE CANAVERAL — The Skylab 3 astronauts took
a final jaunt around South Florida in T3B jets yesterday
to hone their flying skills and help ward off motion
sickness when they blast off for America's orbiting
laboratory today.
William C. Schneider, Skylab program director, said at
a prelaunch briefing yesterday afternoon: "We are now go
for launch at 6:01 a.m. PST today. All of our inspections
and analyses have confirmed that the bird is ready for
flight. I see no reason why we can't go the full 84 days."
Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue and
Edward G. Gibson will spend 84 days aboard the orbiting
scientific laboratory.
Stanford Grad Leads Golf Tourney
PINEHURST, N.C. — Stanford graduate student and
tournament leader Tom Watson blew to a fat,
five-over-par 76 and opened the gate to a stunning charge
by rookie Ben Crenshaw yesterday in the sixth round of
the $500,000 World Open Golf Tournament, the richest
such event ever staged.
The 21-year-old Crenshaw, winner of the San Antonio
Open two weeks ago, came from 18 strokes back with an
eye-popping seven-under-par 64 in dusty, swirling winds
and moved to within six strokes of the lead.
Watson, who matched the course record on the
7,007-yard No. 2 course at the Pinehurst Country Club
with a 62 in Wednesday's fifth round, soared 14 strokes
higher with wildly erratic play that included an eagle, two
birdies, five bogeys and a triple bogey seven.
Today's Weather
Rain and snow are forecast Friday for Northern
California as another cold front moves southward through
the state, the weatherman said.
Highs will reach the 50s to mid 60s today but the
passage of the front will mean slightly cooler temperatures
tomorrow.
Senate Defeats Rationing Move
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday defeated a
Democratic move to require President Nixon to order gas
rationing by Jan. 15 and then adopted an amendment its
sponsor said could slow clean air efforts by two years.
The clean air amendment to emergency energy
legislation, would allow temporary suspension of emission
standards in order to permit the burning of dirtier fuels.
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, the sponsor, said it
would "assure minimum disruption of air quality
programs," but acknowledged that it could "in some
instances delay the achievement of the emission reduction
goals of the Clean Air Act by two years." It passed
overwhelmingly.
The emission standards suspension is one of several
powers Nixon says he needs to meet the energy crisis.
Egypt, Israel Exchange POW's
Prisoners of war came home to Israel and Egypt
yesterday.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, on hand to
welcome returnees to Tel Aviv, declared: "At last we have
arranged things by talks, like human beings, instead of by
tank fire and exploding grenades."
The first Red Cross planes carried wounded prisoners,
some walking and some on stretchers. The International
Red Cross said it expected the full exchange to take about
a week.
In Cairo informants reported a major shakeup in the
Egyptian military high command following Israel's
lightning break through Egypt's Suez line in the last 10
days of the October war.
They said the military calamity, which left the
Egyptian 3rd Army cut off in the Sinai Desert, had
resulted in the tiring of at least one army chief and
creation of a new field command. Observers foresaw the
possibility of court-martial trials in the wake of the failure
to follow up an initial Egyptian success.
Connally Denies Bribery Charge
WASHINGTON — Former Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally denied emphatically last night that he ever
accepted money for his help in arranging higher federal
support prices for the nation's dairy industry.

Edward G. Gibson will spend 84 days aboard the orbiting
scientific laboratory.
Stanford Grad Leads Golf Tourney
PINEHURST, N.C. — Stanford graduate student and
tournament leader Tom Watson blew to a fat,
five-over-par 76 and opened the gate to a stunning charge
by rookie Ben Crenshaw yesterday in the sixth round of
the $500,000 World Open Golf Tournament, the richest
such event ever staged.
The 21-year-old Crenshaw, winner of the San Antonio
Open two weeks ago, came from 18 strokes back with an
eye-popping seven-under-par 64 in dusty, swirling winds
and moved to within six strokes of the lead.
Watson, who matched the course record on the
7,007-yard No. 2 course at the Pinehurst Country Club
with a 62 in Wednesday's fifth round, soared 14 strokes
higher with wildly erratic play that included an eagle, two
birdies, five bogeys and a triple bogey seven.
Today's Weather
Rain and snow are forecast Friday for Northern
California as another cold front moves southward through
the state, the weatherman said.
Highs will reach the 50s to mid 60s today but the
passage of the front will mean slightly cooler temperatures
tomorrow.
Senate Defeats Rationing Move
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday defeated a
Democratic move to require President Nixon to order gas
rationing by Jan. 15 and then adopted an amendment its
sponsor said could slow clean air efforts by two years.
The clean air amendment to emergency energy
legislation, would allow temporary suspension of emission
standards in order to permit the burning of dirtier fuels.
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, the sponsor, said it
would "assure minimum disruption of air quality
programs," but acknowledged that it could "in some
instances delay the achievement of the emission reduction
goals of the Clean Air Act by two years." It passed
overwhelmingly.
The emission standards suspension is one of several
powers Nixon says he needs to meet the energy crisis.
Egypt, Israel Exchange POW's
Prisoners of war came home to Israel and Egypt
yesterday.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, on hand to
welcome returnees to Tel Aviv, declared: "At last we have
arranged things by talks, like human beings, instead of by
tank fire and exploding grenades."
The first Red Cross planes carried wounded prisoners,
some walking and some on stretchers. The International
Red Cross said it expected the full exchange to take about
a week.
In Cairo informants reported a major shakeup in the
Egyptian military high command following Israel's
lightning break through Egypt's Suez line in the last 10
days of the October war.
They said the military calamity, which left the
Egyptian 3rd Army cut off in the Sinai Desert, had
resulted in the tiring of at least one army chief and
creation of a new field command. Observers foresaw the
possibility of court-martial trials in the wake of the failure
to follow up an initial Egyptian success.
Connally Denies Bribery Charge
WASHINGTON — Former Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally denied emphatically last night that he ever
accepted money for his help in arranging higher federal
support prices for the nation's dairy industry.
Connally emerged from a closed-door interrogation
session with Senate Watergate committee lawyers and told
reporters, "anyone that supposes he was present when I
received a payment is a categorical liar."
Connally who said he does not expect to be called as a
witness when the committee opens public hearings into
the so-called milk deal later this month, acknowledged he
had favored higher dairy prices.
Connally said the committee lawyers questioned him
about published reports, denied by Connally, that he
received $15,000 for his role in the decision to approve
higher price supports.

Crisis Pinches Public Transit
Fuel allocations are beginning to pinch public
transportation in several of the nation's cities, and more
transit agencies expect cuts in December unless they get
additional supplies.
The shortage is forcing some companies to search for
alternate sources of fuel supply, often at higher prices,
and to develop contingency plans for service cuts.
"The irony of this is if we're going to have gasoline
rationing, and public transportation is cut back, what are
people going to do?" asked Forrest I. Neal, presiding
officer of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority.
The MBTA, which operates buses, subways and trolleys
in the Boston area, says it will start cutting service Dec. 1
if it doesn't find new sources of fuel.
Skylab Set For Launch
CAPE CANAVERAL — The Skylab 3 astronauts took
a final jaunt around South Florida in T3B jets yesterday
to hone their flying skills and help ward off motion
sickness when they blast off for America's orbiting
laboratory today.
William C. Schneider, Skylab program director, said at
a prelaunch briefing yesterday afternoon: "We are now go
for launch at 6:01 a.m. PST today. All of our inspections
and analyses have confirmed that the bird is ready for
flight. I see no reason why we can't go the full 84 days."
Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue and
Edward G. Gibson will spend 84 days aboard the orbiting
scientific laboratory.
