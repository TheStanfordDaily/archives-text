# Imagination, Sexuality
## Hawkes Emphasizes Vision 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"Imagination and sexual life are
inseparable. Both create ecstacy out of
nothing and that's the only reason for
living," John Hawkes says.
He's been saying it a lot lately. For
the last week, Hawkes has been
reading his works, speaking, teaching,
and talking with faculty and students
as one of the busiest participants in
the Modem Thought and Literature
Conference on "The Creative Process
in Literature and the Arts."
Hawkes is a highly regarded
novelist, "a major visionary writer" in
his own words, and a professor of
English at Brown University where he
teaches creative writing and modern
literature.
Echoing a character from his book
Death, Sleep and the Traveler, which
will be published in April, Hawkes
says, "Pornography is the true field of
the ordinary man's art. In sexuality an
ordinary man becomes an artist."
Hawkes uses highly-charged,
imagistic, poetic language to deal with
the elemental forces of sexuality and
destructive ness.
Although his writing has been

called surrealist, non-realist,
experimentalist and "difficult,"
Hawkes prefers the term "visionary."
According to writer Robert Penn
Warren, his vision is "fantastic,
nightmarish, flickering with disturbing
truths, the ordinary grown ominous."
A writer must constantly try to
further the form of literature, Hawkes
believes. "After I wrote The Cannibal,
I said that the true enemies of the
novel are plot, character, setting and
theme."
'Dull Conventions'
These are reductive, representative
of the "dull conventions of fiction,"
he says."I was creating a vision, a
world, not developing characters to
handle my theme well."
Hawkes thinks that his writing is
becoming purer as he reworks similar
ideas. He observes that there are
maimed figures in each of his last three
novels. The villain is a one-handed man
in Second Skin, a one-armed man in
Blood Oranges.
In his new book, the dualities of
villain and hero combine in a narrator
who is a murderer as well as a lover
and a husband.
Student Readership
In America, Hawkes is read
primarily by students, although he
feels his readership is more
wide-spread in Paris.

"Students are in need of works of
art that deal with the uncertainties and
certainties that young people are
concerned with. They're concerned
with what it means to be yourself, to
be alive, how to gather the powers to
fight a determining system."
People are "bored and horrified
with what's around us, which Hawkes
characterizes as "super-banality." He
says that "difficult" fiction is read in
"unimagineable quantities" because it
"insists on the full potential of human
beings."
'Want To Be Vital'
"People want to be vital," he says.
"This is one more period of genuine
threat to human individuality."
Hawkes denies that the written
word is losing popularity and being
supplanted by film.
He also rejects the claim that of
"new journalists" that the significant
literature of the day is non-fiction
which uses the techniques of fiction.
Calling this "the excitement of
debasebment," Hawkes accuses "new
non-fiction" writers of operating with
preconceived notions of reality.
According to Hawkes, a fiction writer
doesn't preconceive; he goes into the
unknown. Non-fiction can never
"produce the inexplicable leaps and
achievements of imaginative work,"
Hawkes says.

destructive ness.
Although his writing has been

called surrealist, non-realist,
experimentalist and "difficult,"
Hawkes prefers the term "visionary."
According to writer Robert Penn
Warren, his vision is "fantastic,
nightmarish, flickering with disturbing
truths, the ordinary grown ominous."
A writer must constantly try to
further the form of literature, Hawkes
believes. "After I wrote The Cannibal,
I said that the true enemies of the
novel are plot, character, setting and
theme."
'Dull Conventions'
These are reductive, representative
of the "dull conventions of fiction,"
he says."I was creating a vision, a
world, not developing characters to
handle my theme well."
Hawkes thinks that his writing is
becoming purer as he reworks similar
ideas. He observes that there are
maimed figures in each of his last three
novels. The villain is a one-handed man
in Second Skin, a one-armed man in
Blood Oranges.
In his new book, the dualities of
villain and hero combine in a narrator
who is a murderer as well as a lover
and a husband.
Student Readership
In America, Hawkes is read
primarily by students, although he
feels his readership is more
wide-spread in Paris.

"Students are in need of works of
art that deal with the uncertainties and
certainties that young people are
concerned with. They're concerned
with what it means to be yourself, to
be alive, how to gather the powers to
fight a determining system."
People are "bored and horrified
with what's around us, which Hawkes
characterizes as "super-banality." He
says that "difficult" fiction is read in
"unimagineable quantities" because it
"insists on the full potential of human
beings."
'Want To Be Vital'
"People want to be vital," he says.
"This is one more period of genuine
threat to human individuality."
Hawkes denies that the written
word is losing popularity and being
supplanted by film.
He also rejects the claim that of
"new journalists" that the significant
literature of the day is non-fiction
which uses the techniques of fiction.
Calling this "the excitement of
debasebment," Hawkes accuses "new
non-fiction" writers of operating with
preconceived notions of reality.
According to Hawkes, a fiction writer
doesn't preconceive; he goes into the
unknown. Non-fiction can never
"produce the inexplicable leaps and
achievements of imaginative work,"
Hawkes says.
"Imagination and sexual life are
inseparable. Both create ecstacy out of
nothing and that's the only reason for
living," John Hawkes says.
He's been saying it a lot lately. For
the last week, Hawkes has been
reading his works, speaking, teaching,
and talking with faculty and students
as one of the busiest participants in
the Modem Thought and Literature
Conference on "The Creative Process
in Literature and the Arts."
Hawkes is a highly regarded
novelist, "a major visionary writer" in
his own words, and a professor of
English at Brown University where he
teaches creative writing and modern
literature.
Echoing a character from his book
Death, Sleep and the Traveler, which
will be published in April, Hawkes
says, "Pornography is the true field of
the ordinary man's art. In sexuality an
ordinary man becomes an artist."
Hawkes uses highly-charged,
imagistic, poetic language to deal with
the elemental forces of sexuality and
destructive ness.
