# Franklin Still Exploring 'Alternatives'
## 
### MIKE PHILLIPS 
When the University fired Assoc. English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin in 1972, it awarded him seven
months full pay for the "exploration of
alternatives." Today Franklin is still exploring.
More than a year and a half after the Stanford
Advisory Board charged him with inciting students
to riot during 1971 campus demonstrations,
Franklin finds that no University will hire him. He's
having trouble finding any kind of full-time work.
Franklin has held several non-paying or nominally
rewarding jobs — as an editorial consultant for
university presses, a commentator on KPFA radio
and most recently as a member of the editorial
board for Science Fiction Studies.
But his wife, Jane, now provides the regular
income. "He does the shopping and the cooking,"
Jane says. "His specialties are odd combinations of
meat and vegetables because they're economical and
good, though he likes omelettes also."
Jane contributes with her salary as a legal
secretary, a job she has been at for the past three
months. Before that she was a "full time activist and
mother." Sometimes the Franklin's 17-year-old
daughter helps out with her earnings from Kepler's
Bookstore in Menlo Park.
Franklin contributes to the family income with
the little he receives from speaking tours. Earlier
this week he spoke at several East Coast colleges.
Jane said that before he left on the tour he received
a letter saying a "reactionary" professor was going
to block one of his appearances at a college.
Franklin didn't get the chance to speak.
'Little In-Groupies'
"They've got their own little in-groupies," she
said. "Bruce just found out that they [implying
Stanford officials] were spreading rumors, like the
reason he was fired was because he is really a
horrible teacher."
On campus Franklin was acknowledged as a fine
instructor, though students and faculty charged he
taught politics in class, not English. One of his
courses, called "Melville and Marx," drew advocates
of his Maoist ideology, they claimed, and not
Melville devotees.
Ironically enough, the government, which has
absorbed the brunt of his invectives, is another
source of income. Franklin receives $341 a month

because he is a student on a GI bill. (He served as
navigator and intelligence officer in the Strategic Air
Command from 1956 to 1959. In 1966 he resigned
his commission as captain in the Air Force Reserve.)
Studying Horticulture
Franklin studies horticulture at the College of
San Mateo, saying somewhat sarcastically that he's
going to become a gardener. "I've got to do
something for a living," he said.
For a short period in 1972 Franklin was earning
unemployment benefits, though he had to go to
court to collect. State unemployment officials said
that he wasn't serious about a job and spent time
writing letters to universities where his chances for
work were nil.
The unemployment office also charged that he
made himself unattractive as a job candidate
because of his "aggressive action in keeping his
affairs at Stanford which led to his dismissal before
the eyes of the public."
Venceremos Affiliation
They claimed that his affiliation with
Venceremos, a Communist revolutionary group kept
employers from hiring him. Last summer one state
prison official said that Venceremos was "probably

the most dangerous group there is in existence right
now on the streets." His appearance on an ABC talk
show, they added, also scotched his chances for
finding employment.
When the unemployment bureau refused to send
him benefits, Franklin circulated their letter of
refusal to newspapers and then released a reply of
his own. He charged that the unemployment office
throughout California was being used as a "tool of
repression," and that he would take the matter to
court.
"But whether we win or lose this small battle
within the system," he wrote, "we learn from it the
necessity of overthrowing the dictatorship of the
wealthy and establishing a society run by and for
the majority.
No More Unemployment
"Under socialism this particular kind of
oppression is certainly not possible for
unemployment does not exist." After the court's
decision in his favor, he received checks at $40 a
month, but those stopped early this year.
Since then he has applied for non-academic jobs
in the area. Several months ago he sent an
application to a children's book publisher in Palo
Alto, though he was turned down. An employee
said his background wasn't right for the job.
The job resume that Franklin circulates lists 10
books, 22 articles, and line after line of public
presentations, including appearances on the Joe
Pyne program in Los Angeles and the Morning Show
in San Francisco.
Two of the seven Advisory Board members who
voted against firing Franklin said the majority
argued for dismissal because "other penalties would
be without effect," not that dismissal was the best
sanction. Reflecting the opinions of many on the
campus at that time. Advisory Board member
Robert Brown, professor of religion, said "I believe
strongly that however much I and many of my
colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University
will be less a true university without him and more
of a true university with him."
At the present. Franklin is working on a
"political autobiography" entitled Back Where You
Came From which is forthcoming from Harper's
Magazine Press.

board for Science Fiction Studies.
But his wife, Jane, now provides the regular
income. "He does the shopping and the cooking,"
Jane says. "His specialties are odd combinations of
meat and vegetables because they're economical and
good, though he likes omelettes also."
Jane contributes with her salary as a legal
secretary, a job she has been at for the past three
months. Before that she was a "full time activist and
mother." Sometimes the Franklin's 17-year-old
daughter helps out with her earnings from Kepler's
Bookstore in Menlo Park.
Franklin contributes to the family income with
the little he receives from speaking tours. Earlier
this week he spoke at several East Coast colleges.
Jane said that before he left on the tour he received
a letter saying a "reactionary" professor was going
to block one of his appearances at a college.
Franklin didn't get the chance to speak.
'Little In-Groupies'
"They've got their own little in-groupies," she
said. "Bruce just found out that they [implying
Stanford officials] were spreading rumors, like the
reason he was fired was because he is really a
horrible teacher."
On campus Franklin was acknowledged as a fine
instructor, though students and faculty charged he
taught politics in class, not English. One of his
courses, called "Melville and Marx," drew advocates
of his Maoist ideology, they claimed, and not
Melville devotees.
Ironically enough, the government, which has
absorbed the brunt of his invectives, is another
source of income. Franklin receives $341 a month

because he is a student on a GI bill. (He served as
navigator and intelligence officer in the Strategic Air
Command from 1956 to 1959. In 1966 he resigned
his commission as captain in the Air Force Reserve.)
Studying Horticulture
Franklin studies horticulture at the College of
San Mateo, saying somewhat sarcastically that he's
going to become a gardener. "I've got to do
something for a living," he said.
For a short period in 1972 Franklin was earning
unemployment benefits, though he had to go to
court to collect. State unemployment officials said
that he wasn't serious about a job and spent time
writing letters to universities where his chances for
work were nil.
The unemployment office also charged that he
made himself unattractive as a job candidate
because of his "aggressive action in keeping his
affairs at Stanford which led to his dismissal before
the eyes of the public."
Venceremos Affiliation
They claimed that his affiliation with
Venceremos, a Communist revolutionary group kept
employers from hiring him. Last summer one state
prison official said that Venceremos was "probably

the most dangerous group there is in existence right
now on the streets." His appearance on an ABC talk
show, they added, also scotched his chances for
finding employment.
When the unemployment bureau refused to send
him benefits, Franklin circulated their letter of
refusal to newspapers and then released a reply of
his own. He charged that the unemployment office
throughout California was being used as a "tool of
repression," and that he would take the matter to
court.
"But whether we win or lose this small battle
within the system," he wrote, "we learn from it the
necessity of overthrowing the dictatorship of the
wealthy and establishing a society run by and for
the majority.
No More Unemployment
"Under socialism this particular kind of
oppression is certainly not possible for
unemployment does not exist." After the court's
decision in his favor, he received checks at $40 a
month, but those stopped early this year.
Since then he has applied for non-academic jobs
in the area. Several months ago he sent an
application to a children's book publisher in Palo
Alto, though he was turned down. An employee
said his background wasn't right for the job.
The job resume that Franklin circulates lists 10
books, 22 articles, and line after line of public
presentations, including appearances on the Joe
Pyne program in Los Angeles and the Morning Show
in San Francisco.
Two of the seven Advisory Board members who
voted against firing Franklin said the majority
argued for dismissal because "other penalties would
be without effect," not that dismissal was the best
sanction. Reflecting the opinions of many on the
campus at that time. Advisory Board member
Robert Brown, professor of religion, said "I believe
strongly that however much I and many of my
colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University
will be less a true university without him and more
of a true university with him."
At the present. Franklin is working on a
"political autobiography" entitled Back Where You
Came From which is forthcoming from Harper's
Magazine Press.

H. BRUCE FRANKLIN
When the University fired Assoc. English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin in 1972, it awarded him seven
months full pay for the "exploration of
alternatives." Today Franklin is still exploring.

Advisory Board charged him with inciting students
to riot during 1971 campus demonstrations,
Franklin finds that no University will hire him. He's
having trouble finding any kind of full-time work.

the little he receives from speaking tours. Earlier
this week he spoke at several East Coast colleges.
Jane said that before he left on the tour he received
a letter saying a "reactionary" professor was going
to block one of his appearances at a college.
Franklin didn't get the chance to speak.
'Little In-Groupies'
"They've got their own little in-groupies," she
said. "Bruce just found out that they [implying
Stanford officials] were spreading rumors, like the
reason he was fired was because he is really a
horrible teacher."
On campus Franklin was acknowledged as a fine
instructor, though students and faculty charged he
taught politics in class, not English. One of his
courses, called "Melville and Marx," drew advocates
of his Maoist ideology, they claimed, and not
Melville devotees.
Ironically enough, the government, which has
absorbed the brunt of his invectives, is another
source of income. Franklin receives $341 a month

because he is a student on a GI bill. (He served as
navigator and intelligence officer in the Strategic Air
Command from 1956 to 1959. In 1966 he resigned
his commission as captain in the Air Force Reserve.)
Studying Horticulture
Franklin studies horticulture at the College of
San Mateo, saying somewhat sarcastically that he's
going to become a gardener. "I've got to do
something for a living," he said.
For a short period in 1972 Franklin was earning
unemployment benefits, though he had to go to
court to collect. State unemployment officials said
that he wasn't serious about a job and spent time
writing letters to universities where his chances for
work were nil.
The unemployment office also charged that he
made himself unattractive as a job candidate
because of his "aggressive action in keeping his
affairs at Stanford which led to his dismissal before
the eyes of the public."
Venceremos Affiliation
They claimed that his affiliation with
Venceremos, a Communist revolutionary group kept
employers from hiring him. Last summer one state
prison official said that Venceremos was "probably

the most dangerous group there is in existence right
now on the streets." His appearance on an ABC talk
show, they added, also scotched his chances for
finding employment.
When the unemployment bureau refused to send
him benefits, Franklin circulated their letter of
refusal to newspapers and then released a reply of
his own. He charged that the unemployment office
throughout California was being used as a "tool of
repression," and that he would take the matter to
court.
"But whether we win or lose this small battle
within the system," he wrote, "we learn from it the
necessity of overthrowing the dictatorship of the
wealthy and establishing a society run by and for
the majority.
No More Unemployment
"Under socialism this particular kind of
oppression is certainly not possible for
unemployment does not exist." After the court's
decision in his favor, he received checks at $40 a
month, but those stopped early this year.
Since then he has applied for non-academic jobs
in the area. Several months ago he sent an
application to a children's book publisher in Palo
Alto, though he was turned down. An employee
said his background wasn't right for the job.
The job resume that Franklin circulates lists 10
books, 22 articles, and line after line of public
presentations, including appearances on the Joe
Pyne program in Los Angeles and the Morning Show
in San Francisco.
Two of the seven Advisory Board members who
voted against firing Franklin said the majority
argued for dismissal because "other penalties would
be without effect," not that dismissal was the best
sanction. Reflecting the opinions of many on the
campus at that time. Advisory Board member
Robert Brown, professor of religion, said "I believe
strongly that however much I and many of my
colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University
will be less a true university without him and more
of a true university with him."
At the present. Franklin is working on a
"political autobiography" entitled Back Where You
Came From which is forthcoming from Harper's
Magazine Press.

H. BRUCE FRANKLIN
When the University fired Assoc. English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin in 1972, it awarded him seven
months full pay for the "exploration of
alternatives." Today Franklin is still exploring.
More than a year and a half after the Stanford
Advisory Board charged him with inciting students
to riot during 1971 campus demonstrations,
Franklin finds that no University will hire him. He's
having trouble finding any kind of full-time work.
Franklin has held several non-paying or nominally
rewarding jobs — as an editorial consultant for
university presses, a commentator on KPFA radio
and most recently as a member of the editorial
board for Science Fiction Studies.
But his wife, Jane, now provides the regular
income. "He does the shopping and the cooking,"
Jane says. "His specialties are odd combinations of
meat and vegetables because they're economical and
good, though he likes omelettes also."
Jane contributes with her salary as a legal
secretary, a job she has been at for the past three
months. Before that she was a "full time activist and
mother." Sometimes the Franklin's 17-year-old
daughter helps out with her earnings from Kepler's
Bookstore in Menlo Park.
