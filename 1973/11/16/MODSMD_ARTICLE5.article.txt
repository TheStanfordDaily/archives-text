# Dormitories To Close
## During Winter Vacation 
### TERRY ANZUR 
University housing officials
yesterday announced an
unprecedented decision to close, lock,
and cut off heat and electricity in
University residences during the
between-quarter break Dec. 15-Jan. 4.
Residents will not have access to
their rooms or apartments during the
lockup. "We realize there are students
who must stay on campus," asst. dean
of student affairs Larry Horton said.
"For those students we will provide
special housing in one of the dorms at
no charge."
Housing petitions for students who
must remain on campus during the
break will be available in residence
offices beginning Monday. To be
eligible for special housing, students
must return completed applications to
the residence offices before Nov. 29.
Horton said the housing office

"wouldn't rubber stamp" special
housing applications. "No one who
really needs to be around will be
denied housing," he stated, but
emphasized that consideration would
be given only to students involved in
scheduled public events, foreign
students, and students remaining on
campus for "legitimate academic
reasons."
Last year, students were permitted
to live in their regular University
residences during the Christmas recess.
"Last year we left the power on,"
Horton explained. "This year we'll
close down completely and shut off
everything except minimum security
lighting and alarm systems."
The power shutdown is part of a
"total University response to the
energy crisis," Horton said. Plant
Services Director Dan De Young
indicated that the University is still

"zeroing in" on plans to cut off power
in other University buildings during
the academic recess. "We will shut off
power in every building that can be
closed down without a detrimental
effect," DeYoung said.
Cutting off power in the dorms will
save the University $12,000 in fuel
costs, and conserve about 135,000
gallons of fuel, DeYoung estimated.
This savings decreases the
likelihood that Stanford could run out
of fuel during winter quarter. Pacific
Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has
notified DeYoung that Stanford's gas
supply will be cut off for 3.6 days or
more. The University's backup power
system runs on oil, but the 135,000
gallon oil reserve would sustain its
operation for a maximum of five days.
DeYoung added that plant services
will experiment with other energy
conservation measures during the
recess. Academic buildings will be
heated for four hours in the morning
only, in an attempt to discover how
well University buildings retain heat.
DeYoung recently ordered heat and
light shut off in empty classrooms,
blowers to be turned off at night, and
janitorial work to be done during
daylight. He has advised campus
residents to turn off unnecessary
lights, lower thermostats, close doors
and other heat escapes, and reduce use
of electrical equipment.
"The extent to which we can
conserve PG&E gas means less
likelihood that we'll be shut down in a
pinch," commented housing director
Ed Scoles.
Details of the closing arrangements
will be worked out by Dec. 5, when
the housing office will tell students
who must remain on campus where
they will be housed. Students now
living in those residences will be
notified that their rooms will be
occupied during the break.

daylight. He has advised campus
residents to turn off unnecessary
lights, lower thermostats, close doors
and other heat escapes, and reduce use
of electrical equipment.
"The extent to which we can
conserve PG&E gas means less
likelihood that we'll be shut down in a
pinch," commented housing director
Ed Scoles.
Details of the closing arrangements
will be worked out by Dec. 5, when
the housing office will tell students
who must remain on campus where
they will be housed. Students now
living in those residences will be
notified that their rooms will be
occupied during the break.
University housing officials
yesterday announced an
unprecedented decision to close, lock,
and cut off heat and electricity in
University residences during the
between-quarter break Dec. 15-Jan. 4.
Residents will not have access to
their rooms or apartments during the
lockup. "We realize there are students
who must stay on campus," asst. dean
of student affairs Larry Horton said.
"For those students we will provide
special housing in one of the dorms at
no charge."
Housing petitions for students who
must remain on campus during the
break will be available in residence
offices beginning Monday. To be
eligible for special housing, students
must return completed applications to
the residence offices before Nov. 29.
Horton said the housing office

"wouldn't rubber stamp" special
housing applications. "No one who
really needs to be around will be
denied housing," he stated, but
emphasized that consideration would
be given only to students involved in
scheduled public events, foreign
students, and students remaining on
campus for "legitimate academic
reasons."
Last year, students were permitted
to live in their regular University
residences during the Christmas recess.
"Last year we left the power on,"
Horton explained. "This year we'll
close down completely and shut off
everything except minimum security
lighting and alarm systems."
The power shutdown is part of a
"total University response to the
energy crisis," Horton said. Plant
Services Director Dan De Young
indicated that the University is still

"zeroing in" on plans to cut off power
in other University buildings during
the academic recess. "We will shut off
power in every building that can be
closed down without a detrimental
effect," DeYoung said.
Cutting off power in the dorms will
save the University $12,000 in fuel
costs, and conserve about 135,000
gallons of fuel, DeYoung estimated.
This savings decreases the
likelihood that Stanford could run out
of fuel during winter quarter. Pacific
Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has
notified DeYoung that Stanford's gas
supply will be cut off for 3.6 days or
more. The University's backup power
system runs on oil, but the 135,000
gallon oil reserve would sustain its
operation for a maximum of five days.
DeYoung added that plant services
will experiment with other energy
conservation measures during the
recess. Academic buildings will be
heated for four hours in the morning
only, in an attempt to discover how
well University buildings retain heat.
DeYoung recently ordered heat and
light shut off in empty classrooms,
blowers to be turned off at night, and
janitorial work to be done during
daylight. He has advised campus
residents to turn off unnecessary
lights, lower thermostats, close doors
and other heat escapes, and reduce use
of electrical equipment.
