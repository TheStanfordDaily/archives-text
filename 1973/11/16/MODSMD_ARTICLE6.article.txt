# Sophomore Pre-Reg Procedures Changed
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Sophomores who have not declared
a major will need their advisor's
signature to file their winter quarter
study lists it was announced yesterday.
Previously, sophomores were required
to obtain signatures only in autumn
quarter.
Copies of the winter quarter Time
Schedule, which contains information
and instructions for pre-registration
and class list signups, are now available

at the information window in Old
Union.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Mason Yearian said the change
will have little effect on students who
pre-register starting today, "because
they have to see their advisors to pick
up their Permits to Register anyway."
He added that students will not need
the signatures on registration day, but
must obtain them before the deadline
for filing study lists two weeks later.
Yearian said the new procedure
stemmed from a Committee on
Undergraduate Studies decision made
last spring, and not directly from a
recent SWOPSI report entitled "The
Other Stanford," which revealed that
many students had little contact with
their advisors.
"However, I agree with the SWOPSI
conclusions," he said. "Students don't
see their advisors often enough, and
we feel that sophomores who have not
declared a major need to talk to them
as much as anyone does. It's important
that they have a program of study
which will fit a longer-range plan."
The Undergraduate Studies office
has also initiated a new series of "Beer
and Rap" sessions in the dorms in an
attempt to familiarize students with
the office. At the first such program,
held in Branner Hall on Nov. 7,
students and administrators discussed
the topic "Is Stanford Intellectual
Enough?" Attended by about 50
students, the program met with
lukewarm reactions from Branner
students interviewed, but Yearian
termed himself "optimistic" over the
program's potential.
"Our staff realized last summer that
we weren't well enough known to the
students," he said. "We'll try to have
at least one of these rap sessions a
month and go to several dorms. We're
still experimenting with the format for
the sessions, but we hope that they
and our forthcoming publication, 'A
Stanford Education,' will help bridge
some of the gaps the SWOPSI report
described."
In other procedural developments,
Yearian characterized widespread
errors in students' class standing on
study lists as a computer programming
mistake "which has yet to be
corrected." He also announced a new
registration procedure which will make
class-list signing order independent of
the student's class. The order will now
be solely alphabetical; this quarter,
students whose last names begin with
the letter "E" will be first eligible to
sign.
