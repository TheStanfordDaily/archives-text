## On The Road To SC With LSJUMB 
### 
It's almost Saturday again:
going to the game? What, so
heartsick over last week's moral
victory/7 second defeat at USC,
that you're giving up Stanford
football? Well don't. You can
study later: go to the game and
see the Gods (of both the team
and the Band.)
There, got the key word
"Band" into the lead paragraph,
which shows the extent to which
one's creative urge is controlled
by that demon, Daily Style.
Speaking of style, I'd like to take
a quick aside and comment on a
sports column in last Friday's
Daily.
I refer to the Garvin piece on
the SC hatred: "More Than A
Football Game." The quote
attributed to me was limp,
lackluster, and completely devoid
of syntactical precision. Unless
Garvin was attempting to make
my newspaper voice come across
as garbled as my Announcer's
voice (in which case, it's a master
stroke of subtlety), he did not do
me justice. I do not really sound
like a retarded salamander
speaking underwater ... nor like a
regular salamander, for that
matter.
Enough of the aside. In the
column proper, I come not to
praise the team but to bury any
ignorance you have about the
Band when it's not playing at a
home game. SC (or UCLA) is our
big, once-a-season Pacific Eight
out-of-town performance. So
follow along in your newspaper as
I chronicle the obscene and often
funny cavortings of the
Incomparables on Tour in Los
Angeles.
Bright And Early
7:00 a.m.: Board busses for
quick jaunt to SF airport. 25
minutes of gross yells. Arrive at
airport to find that Fred
Hargadon, the head honcho Dean
over at Admissions, will be on the
same flight. Five minutes of
"Hargedon's in charge" yells.
8:00 a.m.: Board PSA's hot
pink, grinning, tin tube for
hour-long airborne romp to LA.
Stewardess asks everyone to
please observe the Emergency
Instruction Card, "located in the
seat back directly in front of
you." 155 hands wave cards
overhead, as a cheer goes up.
Stewardess flashes back an 'it's
going to be one of those days'
look.
Stewardess continues
introductory remarks with an

oxygen mask demonstration.
Trombonist Bob Brown waves a
temporarily-captured oxygen
mask of his own and mimics the
demonstration to the middle
section of the plane. Stewardess
loves it.
Dolly Definition
Aircraft begins final runway
spring during takeoff, as 100
voices yell, "Captain — pull your
stick up!" Halfway through flight,
Stewardess serves punch and is
offered a full Dolly Scholarship.
"But what is a Dolly?" she asks.
Real Dolly, Marcella Deffke,
smiles and tells Stewardess what
Dollies are. Stewardess begs off,
mumbling about already having a
job. 20 minutes later, Deffke is
still smiling.
As plane begins final descent
through smog layer over LA,
Stewardess goes to the PA
System: "Please bring your seats
to the full upright position." Band
reply: "Bring What to the full
upright position, m'am? Could
you help me out?"
During deboarding process.
Stewardess call button begins
regular, incessant ringing. PA
booms out, "Stop ringing that
bell!"
9:30 a.m.: Bus driver (waiting
in taxi stand/loading zone to pick
us up and take us to the
Coliseum) gets a five-minute
lecture from one of LA's finest. .
When You're Hot,
You're Hot!
Text of lecture: "I told you
once to move; you can't stay here.
Now I really hope you boys do
well against SC, but you're gonna
have to move. It's a $50 fine and
I'll really smack it on you. Taxis
pay $25,000 for this space and
they're hot, the limousine service
is hot, and I'm getting hot. Now
move!"
Later: Stadium Security Guard
tries to stop our bus from driving
through special back-of-the-
Coliseum area. We tell him we're
supposed to play a rally there.
"You can't go through!" he says.
"Are you hot?" Band shouts as
we go through and park the bus.
Two rallies, one pregame show,
one halftime show, 59 minutes
and 53 seconds of good football,
and 7 seconds of horse manure
later, the Band is playing its
traditional post-game concert.
During the concert, the
stadium empties, except for some
300 avid Band fans. (SC Band
plays to empty seats for 5 minutes

then marches out.) Stadium now
completely empty except for us
and our many listeners. LA
County Sheriff's Deputy gets
itchy; wants Stanford crowd to
leave. He goes up to the Drum
Major, Buzz Thompson, and
points to his watch.
Buzz motions toward the exit
tunnel with his baton and 150
Bandsmen and the crowd shout
their refusal to leave. Sheriff says
to crowd, "You can't stay here!"
Crowd stays there. Band,
wondering where they heard that
line before, loves it. Sheriff smiles
and ok's one last song, then in
middle of it blows his whistle,
expecting the music to stop.
Bandsmen, conditioned to hear
Buzz's higher pitched whistle, and
no other, don't stop. Sheriff
gestures angrily toward Buzz, who
motions for Band to leave, while
continuing song on the way out.
One More Rally
Buzz runs to edge of Band,
then circles round back as song
continues and new one begins.
Crowd cheers and Sheriff walks
off. The Band finally finishes,
plays one more rally, then boards
busses for ride to LA airport.
9:00 p.m.: Incomparables
board PSA pink-striped tube
streak jet for flight home.
Stewardess asks passengers to
please observe the Emergency
Instruction Card: Band waves 130
cards (some were too plastered to
do much of anything).

Jerry Coleman

Stewardess demonstrates use of
oxygen mask; two Bandsmen
demonstrate use of Air Distress
Bag. Jet spurts down runway and
into the air to a chorus of
"Stroke, stroke, stroke .. . YES!"
As aircraft taxis to a stop at
the SF terminal, stewardess
interrupts her normal, slick,
hope-you-fly-PSA-again-soon
routine to ad lib: "All right — just
cut it out with the bell."
Over and out.

every other Friday on this page.)
