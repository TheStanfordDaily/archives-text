CO-OP believes in
tight food budgets .
especially yours! s
Any store can call itself a discount food store .. . but their ' V llv.Jr''' \
motive is still to get your dollars! This is where the great ; \ ? \
difference is in comparing CO-OP and the ordinary discount j "jO&t
food stores. CO-OP serves as the consumer's buying agent, / titT JH jfl s $ jlj, flu M off
not the manufacturer's selling agent. Its success depends I B* 5K
on the contentment of its paid members and the customers / j \
of the community. Discount does not always mean savings / / *-<. /,
when the quality of the merchandise is not up to the [ j 4 -
standards of the buyer. CO-OP offers quality meat and \ I ~~ J> re
produce as we\\ as name brand and CO-OP brand dairy \ I t \
and canned goods specials. \ \ \
Our meat departments feature USDA choice beef, fresh \ Jl J
California-grown chickens, the widest selection of domestic \V \
and imported cheeses, and delicatessen sections which \\ \ / " J
include specialty sausages. \\ \ \ * 1 /v
The largest selection of fresh produce (bought locally, /
delivered to us daily) will be found, with many Oriental and S \V /
other imported fruits and vegetables available. 112
CO-OP carries the most extensive variety of grocery items. Kosher foods, Oriental products, Natural flours and cereals,
and many kinds of imported foods will be found on the shelves. We feature 500 to 600 food items usually found only
in specialty and health food stores. In addition, CO-OP offers its shoppers coffee bars, free recipes,, consumer information,
unit pricing, price-per-pound charts. Whole grains in bulk form have been added recently
CO-OP tries to help you get the most out of your dollars â€” Not to get the
"most dollars" out of you.
