# Cards Test Resilience Against Ducks
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Think back one week. The Los
Angeles Coliseum, screaming
crowds, an outside shot at the
Rose Bowl, a last-second 27-26
loss to hated rival USC.
Think ahead one week. The Big
Game against Cal, a huge crowd,
water balloons, card stunts,
players thinking of revenge for
last year's 24-21 loss to the Bears
in a game punctuated by fights.
And so, it's probably hard for
the Stanford football team to
think of today's game with
Oregon, which begins at 1:30.
"With all the emotion and
disappointment of last week, it
will be a challenge for us to
regroup and get ready for
Oregon," Coach Jack Christiansen
admitted. Chris is, however,
optimistic: "I think our players
are as resilient as tennis balls .. .
they'll bounce back."
Reynolds Wrap
The Cards will need the
resilience of Wilson's
fresh-from-the-can if they are to
stop the Ducks, whose fortunes
have been sealed in Reynolds
wrap.
Tailback Don Reynolds,
despite a chronic ankle problem,
is second only to UCLA's Kermit
Johnson in Pacific Eight rushing
with 853 yards and second only
to Steve Prefontaine in the hearts
of Oregonians. Reynolds' 85-yard
touchdown run played a big role
in last year's 15-13 win over the
Cardinals.
While Oregon has only a 2-7
record, its wins have come in
impressive fashion. The Ducks
triumphed 41-10 over Cal and

58-0 over Washington. In
addition, the team has played
better than has Stanford against
UCLA and Michigan, losing 24-0
to the Wolverines and 27-7 to the
Bruins last Saturday.
While Reynolds leads the
running attack, Herb Singleton, a
transfer from Compton (Calif.)
junior college, has taken over the
passing game from Dan Fouts, last
year's star quarterback.
Quick Rise
Singleton began the year as the
Ducks' third QB and did not play
in the opening game of the year,
but quickly worked his way up.
The junior is now in solid
possession of fourth place in Pac-8
passing and total offense statistics,
and could move up even further.
Unlike most teams, Oregon's
leading receiver is its tight end,
Russ Francis, who has caught 26
passes for an unusually-good 17.4
yard average.
Another threat is slotback-split
end Bob Palm. A junior, Palm is
the team's second-leading receiver,
star punter (averaging 40.4 yards),
and has also been sharing the
placekicking duties.
Defensively, the Ducks have
been strong, holding explosive
Arizona State to 26 points in
addition to the fine efforts against
Michigan and UCLA.
Starting defensive end Keith
Davis reinjured his ankle in
practice Tuesday and will not play
today. The Ducks are otherwise
generally helathy, but cannot
afford injuries to linebackers or
defensive backs, as they have little
depth.
One player Stanford fans will

remember from last year is safety
Mario Clark. Clark became the
first freshman ever to be named
"Pac-8 defensive player of the
week" when he picked off two of
Mikeßoryla's passes in the fourth
quarter to clinch Oregon's win.
Last year's Duck victory
snapped a five-game Stanford
winning streak, and the Cards
have not lost to Oregon at home
since 1963, the last year Stanford
finished with a losing record.
The game has added
significance for both teams. A win

by Stanford would ensure the
team's sixth straight winning
season.
A win by Oregon would leave
the Ducks 3-3 in the conference
going into next week's traditional
battle with Oregon State, and give
the team a chance for only its
second conference winning year

Oregon will likely be
celebrating on Monday, when
Prefontaine closes the books on
his record running career at the
NCAA cross-country
championships at Spokane. Unless
Stanford keeps its mind on
today's game, the celebration may
begin early.

And so, it's probably hard for
the Stanford football team to
think of today's game with
Oregon, which begins at 1:30.
"With all the emotion and
disappointment of last week, it
will be a challenge for us to
regroup and get ready for
Oregon," Coach Jack Christiansen
admitted. Chris is, however,
optimistic: "I think our players
are as resilient as tennis balls .. .
they'll bounce back."
Reynolds Wrap
The Cards will need the
resilience of Wilson's
fresh-from-the-can if they are to
stop the Ducks, whose fortunes
have been sealed in Reynolds
wrap.
Tailback Don Reynolds,
despite a chronic ankle problem,
is second only to UCLA's Kermit
Johnson in Pacific Eight rushing
with 853 yards and second only
to Steve Prefontaine in the hearts
of Oregonians. Reynolds' 85-yard
touchdown run played a big role
in last year's 15-13 win over the
Cardinals.
While Oregon has only a 2-7
record, its wins have come in
impressive fashion. The Ducks
triumphed 41-10 over Cal and

58-0 over Washington. In
addition, the team has played
better than has Stanford against
UCLA and Michigan, losing 24-0
to the Wolverines and 27-7 to the
Bruins last Saturday.
While Reynolds leads the
running attack, Herb Singleton, a
transfer from Compton (Calif.)
junior college, has taken over the
passing game from Dan Fouts, last
year's star quarterback.
Quick Rise
Singleton began the year as the
Ducks' third QB and did not play
in the opening game of the year,
but quickly worked his way up.
The junior is now in solid
possession of fourth place in Pac-8
passing and total offense statistics,
and could move up even further.
Unlike most teams, Oregon's
leading receiver is its tight end,
Russ Francis, who has caught 26
passes for an unusually-good 17.4
yard average.
Another threat is slotback-split
end Bob Palm. A junior, Palm is
the team's second-leading receiver,
star punter (averaging 40.4 yards),
and has also been sharing the
placekicking duties.
Defensively, the Ducks have
been strong, holding explosive
Arizona State to 26 points in
addition to the fine efforts against
Michigan and UCLA.
Starting defensive end Keith
Davis reinjured his ankle in
practice Tuesday and will not play
today. The Ducks are otherwise
generally helathy, but cannot
afford injuries to linebackers or
defensive backs, as they have little
depth.
One player Stanford fans will

remember from last year is safety
Mario Clark. Clark became the
first freshman ever to be named
"Pac-8 defensive player of the
week" when he picked off two of
Mikeßoryla's passes in the fourth
quarter to clinch Oregon's win.
Last year's Duck victory
snapped a five-game Stanford
winning streak, and the Cards
have not lost to Oregon at home
since 1963, the last year Stanford
finished with a losing record.
The game has added
significance for both teams. A win

by Stanford would ensure the
team's sixth straight winning
season.
A win by Oregon would leave
the Ducks 3-3 in the conference
going into next week's traditional
battle with Oregon State, and give
the team a chance for only its
second conference winning year

Oregon will likely be
celebrating on Monday, when
Prefontaine closes the books on
his record running career at the
NCAA cross-country
championships at Spokane. Unless
Stanford keeps its mind on
today's game, the celebration may
begin early.
