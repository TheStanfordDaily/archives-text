# Stars Stillwell, Donovan 'End' Plays
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
You have to feel sorry for
anybody who runs to the right
side of the Stanford defensive
line. Because there waiting for
him will be end Roger Stillwell,
6-6 and 250 pounds, ready to eat
someone alive.
Coming face to face with
someone like Stillwell would give
anyone second thoughts about
trying it again. But the ball carrier
who decides to try to the left side
will have other problems: Pat
Donovan, a 6-5, 235 pound gorilla
masquerading as an end is
foremost among them.
With such an unattractive pair
of alternatives available to enemy
runners, it's hard to see why they
try at all. But they do: most of
them, for some reason, decide to
run to Donovan's side.
"After the first three games, I
was really delighted," Stillwell
says, shaking his head. "There was
no discrimination in which way
they were going to run ... I got a
lot of action. But the last five or
six games they weren't running
my way."
Donovan thinks he knows why.
"They don't want to run to
Stillwell. He's the best defensive
lineman in the country. They just
don't think they have people who
can handle him."

Donovan doesn't feel insulted,
though. "There's only two places
they can go. If Roger was 5-4 and
125 pounds it would make me
mad, maybe, but I have no qualms
at a 11.... If you have to play
second fiddle, this is a good place
to do it."
One result of the trend toward
the left side of the line has been
that Donovan has 89 tackles —
which makes him the team leader
— and Stillwell has only 54.
Neither man is too worried about
it.
"The tackle chart is really a
crummy system of rating how a
guy's playing," Donovan says.
"What if they run at your side 20
times and you make three tackles?
Are you as good as the guy who
gets three tackles when they only
run his way three times?"
"When Southern Cal ran that
'student body left' [a sweep] they
stacked up three linemen,"
Stillwell points out. "My job was
to tackle the fullback and leave a
clear shot [at the ball] for the
linebacker. You don't get tackles
that way.
'Backers Can Fly
"The defenses we've been
running this year are really
designed for our linebackers. They
can really fly.. .. We're just
supposed to hold off the offensive

linemen and create holes for the
linebackers," Still well continues.
"I try to get as many pursuit
tackles as I can, but Donovan and
Company don't leave much over
there."
Both men agree that Stanford's
new 50 defense, which uses only
three defensive linemen, has made
their job harder and results in less
tackles. But they also agree that
it's a good defense.
"Before we had to hit the
tackles, play to the outside, watch
for reverse, things like that. But
we used to play outside the
offensive tackle," Donovan
explains. "Now we have to hit the
man and play head up. You have
to be able to go either side of
your man, not just one side.
Both Sides Now
"Before your job was on one
side, and if you could help out on
the other that was just great. Now
our job is on both sides; we're
never off the hook," he adds.
"But it's a better defense, no
doubt about it"
The reduction in the number
of tackles for defensive linemen
has made it a little harder for
them to get any publicity — and it
wasn't very easy anyway.
"You can't get very worried
about that," Stillwell explains. "I
know that at certain times during
the year, I'll have a chance to get
an interception. At Southern Cal I
just missed a chance to run one
for a touchdown. But that's not as
important as doing your job on
every play."
"When they choose player of

the game, they look at certain
things," Donovan says. "Blocked
passes, fumble recoveries, those
kind of things. But those are
really just luck. Those guys don't

know who's helping the team;
they just guess. Sometimes they
make a pretty good guess."
Donovan has twice been named
"defensive player of the game."
It doesn't take much of a
guess, though, to know that if
Stanford contains the Oregon
running game this afternoon, a
great deal of the credit must go to
Messrs. Stillwell and Donovan.
Even if you don't hear their
names a whole lot.

its not a wise game plan to run to the side opposite Roger Stillwell.
