# Unsung Reynolds Among Best Backs In Nation
## 
### STAN WILSON 
The Pacific Eight's best
running back? Anthony Davis you
say? 'Sure, Southern Cal's A.D.,'
someone says. 'The man who does
it all. The Heisman Trophy
candidate, the little guy who
single-handedly demolished Notre
Dame last year with six
touchdowns.'
'What about the Blair Pair?'
offers another. 'You know —
McAlister and Johnson. Especially
Johnson, the big guy who's
leading the conference in rushing,
the guy who gobbles up eight
yards every time John Sciarra
hands him the pigskin.'
'What about Donnie
Reynolds?' someone suggests.
Donnie who?
'Reynolds, Donnie Reynolds.
The little guy who does it all for
the University of Oregon. The guy
who can run and catch and throw
with the best of 'em. The guy
who's seventh in the nation in
all-purpose running, and second in
the Pac-Eight in rushing. The guy
who's name fans are learning
almost as fast as they're forgetting
old Anthony what's-his-name.'
Learning Fast
Because he's played in the
shadow of Johnson and McAlister
and Davis, Reynolds' name isn't
exactly a household word to most
sports fans. But opposing players
and coaches aren't having any
trouble learning his name. "That
Reynolds is some running back,"
says Arizona State coach Frank
Kush. "He's tough; he runs to
daylight extremely well." Kush
ought to know a good running
back when he sees one — he's the
coach of all-everything back
Woody Green.
Utah linebacker Rick Barsness
is another who has no trouble
remembering who's inside jersey
No. 22, though he's had a little
trouble grabbing that jersey on
occasion. "He's a jitterbug," says
Barsness. "You worry every time
he has the ball that he'll cut back
squeeze through, and break one
on you."
California linebacker Dallas
Hickman, another player who
spent the better part of one
Saturday afternoon grasping for a
ball carrier who wasn't there, says,
"He'd come at you full speed,
stop, cut back, and be on his way.
Wow! He's the best I've ever
seen."
Helped Beat Cards
And Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen probably has little
trouble remembering Reynolds'
name. Last fall the diminutive
speedster darted 85 yards for a
touchdown as the otherwise
aerial-minded Ducks upset
Stanford 15-13 in Eugene.
"He's one of the tops in the

country," says Christiansen. "He's
got good agility, great balance,
and fine speed — he's an
outstanding football player."
But Stanford's head coach
cautions against comparing the
5-8 junior tailback with the
Pac-Eight's other great backs, past
and present. Reynolds is much
smaller than McAlister and
Johnson and O.J. Simpson and
Bobby Moore. For some,
however, the comparison with
Mike Garrett is irresistible.
But Reynolds shuns
comparisons. "I wouldn't
compare myself with anyone," he
says. "When we were playing

Arizona State, people compared
me to Woody Green. But runners
have their own styles."
Reynolds' style is to skip, to
dart, to slide — first full speed,
now stopping on a dime, now
reversing field. He's tough, he's
dangerous, always fighting for
that extra yard and usually getting
it.
"It's not just his athletic ability
that's so fantastic," says Oregon
head coach Dick Enright. "It's
also the fact that he's got such a
big heart. He's head and shoulders
above other runners because he
always rises to the occasion, and
that's what spells greatness."

comparisons. "I wouldn't
compare myself with anyone," he
says. "When we were playing

Arizona State, people compared
me to Woody Green. But runners
have their own styles."
Reynolds' style is to skip, to
dart, to slide — first full speed,
now stopping on a dime, now
reversing field. He's tough, he's
dangerous, always fighting for
that extra yard and usually getting
it.
"It's not just his athletic ability
that's so fantastic," says Oregon
head coach Dick Enright. "It's
also the fact that he's got such a
big heart. He's head and shoulders
above other runners because he
always rises to the occasion, and
that's what spells greatness."

REYNOLDS RAPS—"I wouldn't compare myself to anyone," says
Oregon tailback Don Reynolds, a 5-8 star who is compaed to Heisman
trophy-winner Mike Garrett and Arizona State's Woody Green, among
other great backs.
The Pacific Eight's best
running back? Anthony Davis you
say? 'Sure, Southern Cal's A.D.,'
someone says. 'The man who does
it all. The Heisman Trophy
candidate, the little guy who
single-handedly demolished Notre
Dame last year with six
touchdowns.'
'What about the Blair Pair?'
offers another. 'You know —
McAlister and Johnson. Especially
Johnson, the big guy who's
leading the conference in rushing,
the guy who gobbles up eight
yards every time John Sciarra
hands him the pigskin.'
'What about Donnie
Reynolds?' someone suggests.
Donnie who?
'Reynolds, Donnie Reynolds.
The little guy who does it all for
the University of Oregon. The guy
who can run and catch and throw
with the best of 'em. The guy
who's seventh in the nation in
all-purpose running, and second in
the Pac-Eight in rushing. The guy
who's name fans are learning
almost as fast as they're forgetting
old Anthony what's-his-name.'
Learning Fast
Because he's played in the
shadow of Johnson and McAlister
and Davis, Reynolds' name isn't
exactly a household word to most
sports fans. But opposing players
and coaches aren't having any
trouble learning his name. "That
Reynolds is some running back,"
says Arizona State coach Frank
Kush. "He's tough; he runs to
daylight extremely well." Kush
ought to know a good running
back when he sees one — he's the
coach of all-everything back
Woody Green.
Utah linebacker Rick Barsness
is another who has no trouble
remembering who's inside jersey
No. 22, though he's had a little
trouble grabbing that jersey on
occasion. "He's a jitterbug," says
Barsness. "You worry every time
he has the ball that he'll cut back
squeeze through, and break one
on you."
California linebacker Dallas
Hickman, another player who
spent the better part of one
Saturday afternoon grasping for a
ball carrier who wasn't there, says,
"He'd come at you full speed,
stop, cut back, and be on his way.
Wow! He's the best I've ever
seen."
Helped Beat Cards
And Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen probably has little
trouble remembering Reynolds'
name. Last fall the diminutive
speedster darted 85 yards for a
touchdown as the otherwise
aerial-minded Ducks upset
Stanford 15-13 in Eugene.
"He's one of the tops in the

country," says Christiansen. "He's
got good agility, great balance,
and fine speed — he's an
outstanding football player."
But Stanford's head coach
cautions against comparing the
5-8 junior tailback with the
Pac-Eight's other great backs, past
and present. Reynolds is much
smaller than McAlister and
Johnson and O.J. Simpson and
Bobby Moore. For some,
however, the comparison with
Mike Garrett is irresistible.
