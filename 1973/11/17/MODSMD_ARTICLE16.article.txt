# Pac-8 Kings Don't Play Key Games
## 
### 
It's impossible to imagine a
game that will mean more than
the battle of USC and UCLA in
the Los Angeles Coliseum one
week from today. The winner
goes to the Rose Bowl, the loser
faces the taunts of its crosstown
rivals for the next year.
And it's just as hard to
construct less meaningful games
than the USC-Washington and
Oregon State at UCLA contests
today.
First, Washington is doomed to
finish last in the conference, while
Oregon State seems destined for
the seventh spot. So it's unlikely
either of the league's top two
teams will falter.
And even more unimportantly,
even if either the Bruins or
Trojans do manage to lose, the
loss won't matter, as, the way
Pacific Eight tie-breaking is set up,
it'll still be the winner of next
week's game that'll take the
freeway trip to Pasadena.
Much the same is true in the
Big 10, where unbeaten Michigan
and Ohio State play Purdue and
lowa, respectively, prior to next
week's shootout at Ann Arbor.
These games are slightly more
important, however, as both
teams need impressive wins to
suitably demonstrate their talents
to those who choose national
champions.
The day's third Pac-8 game,
California at Washington State,
can affect the final standings.
Both teams are 2-3 in conference
play, and need wins to lift
themselves into the league's first
division.
The Cougars have an advantage
over the Bears in that the game
will be played in generally
freezing Pullman. This factor
shouldn't hamper WSU's running
attack as much as it will bother
the California passing game.
With the conference race
taking a week's breather, and all
four traditional rivalry games next
week, an important facet of this
week's games will be statistical
battles.
Stanford's Mike Boryla, USC's
Pat Haden and Oregon State's
Alvin White have been taking
, turns grabbing the league's passing
lead. Boryla is currently in front
with 153.3 yards, ahead of Haden

with 151.6 and White with 150.6.
In team statistics, UCLA is
comfortably out in front in total,
rushing and scoring offense.
Stanford has the lead in passing
offense, but the Cards' running
game has been so weak that the
Cards are dead last in not only
rushing offense but also total
offense.
USC holds fairly big leads in
total and scoring defense, and is
second to UCLA in rushing
defense and to Stanford in passing
defense.

Oregon State at UCLA contests
today.
First, Washington is doomed to
finish last in the conference, while
Oregon State seems destined for
the seventh spot. So it's unlikely
either of the league's top two
teams will falter.
And even more unimportantly,
even if either the Bruins or
Trojans do manage to lose, the
loss won't matter, as, the way
Pacific Eight tie-breaking is set up,
it'll still be the winner of next
week's game that'll take the
freeway trip to Pasadena.
Much the same is true in the
Big 10, where unbeaten Michigan
and Ohio State play Purdue and
lowa, respectively, prior to next
week's shootout at Ann Arbor.
These games are slightly more
important, however, as both
teams need impressive wins to
suitably demonstrate their talents
to those who choose national
champions.
The day's third Pac-8 game,
California at Washington State,
can affect the final standings.
Both teams are 2-3 in conference
play, and need wins to lift
themselves into the league's first
division.
The Cougars have an advantage
over the Bears in that the game
will be played in generally
freezing Pullman. This factor
shouldn't hamper WSU's running
attack as much as it will bother
the California passing game.
With the conference race
taking a week's breather, and all
four traditional rivalry games next
week, an important facet of this
week's games will be statistical
battles.
Stanford's Mike Boryla, USC's
Pat Haden and Oregon State's
Alvin White have been taking
, turns grabbing the league's passing
lead. Boryla is currently in front
with 153.3 yards, ahead of Haden

with 151.6 and White with 150.6.
In team statistics, UCLA is
comfortably out in front in total,
rushing and scoring offense.
Stanford has the lead in passing
offense, but the Cards' running
game has been so weak that the
Cards are dead last in not only
rushing offense but also total
offense.
USC holds fairly big leads in
total and scoring defense, and is
second to UCLA in rushing
defense and to Stanford in passing
defense.
It's impossible to imagine a
game that will mean more than
the battle of USC and UCLA in
the Los Angeles Coliseum one
week from today. The winner
goes to the Rose Bowl, the loser
faces the taunts of its crosstown
rivals for the next year.
And it's just as hard to
construct less meaningful games
than the USC-Washington and
Oregon State at UCLA contests
today.
