# Martin Suspended
## 
### 
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
announced this morning that
defensive tackle Joe Martin has
been suspended from today's
game because of an altercation
with an official in the closing
moments of last week's USC
game.
"The incident was first brought
to my attention by Pac-8
Commissioner Wiles Hallock on
Monday," Ruetz said in a
prepared statement, "and together
we investigated all aspects of the
incident. After consultation with
other conference commissioners
around the country and the
official involved, it was my
decision to impose this one game
sanction against the guilty player,
and this action had the
concurrence of Commissioner
Hallock."
Martin, a senior, had been
chosen as one of today's game
captains.
