# Clowning Murphy Takes Job Seriously
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It was late one night on one of
those omnipresent football trips,
the ones that seem to make up at
least half of Bob Murphy's life,
and Stanford's sports information
director drove past a Seattle filling
station. A neon sign read
"Washington 20, Stanford 15."
So Murphy stealthily parked
his car, walked up to the sign and
rearranged the letters and
numbers. The new prediction —
"Snodfart 152, Washington 0,"
much to the delight of Stanford
alums who cruised by later that
evening.
Bob Murphy has been
entertaining Stanford alumni since
1965, when he first joined
Stanford's athletic staff. In fact
he's been entertaining the press,
coaches, players and friends
during those eight years —
everybody laughs when Bob
Murphy's on stage.
"There's far too much
seriousness in the world," Murphy
says, and he tries to remedy that
situation with a seemingly
unending arsenal of jokes, some
unprintable but all entertaining.
He tells them at banquets, booster
clubs and parties. He even tells the
printable ones on radio, as the
color man on KSFO's Stanford
football broadcasts, or on
Stanford and San Francisco 49er
television highlight shows or on
Mutual Radio Network golf
broadcasts.
Job's A Stage
"It's all provided me as a great
'stage' from which to represent
Stanford," he says, "but it's
funny because I never really
thought of muself as an
entertainer."
As sports information director,
Murphy must be an entertainer,
administrator and publicist. His
office puts out weekly releases
and statistics for the various
media, in addition to assuming the
difficult task of "keeping
everybody happy."
He is the "middle man" in the
often abrasive relations between
the coaches and the press, a role
that requires him to continually
assess his responsibilities to the
Univeisity, the coach, the athletes
and the media — responsibilities
he considers dead serious.
"It's hard when you have the
reputation of being a funny guy
for people to take you seriously. I
can see how lonesome a comedian
can be," he said.
Murphy's association with
Stanford began in 1931, when he
was born at Stanford Hospital,
presumably leaving the delivery
room with an "I'm a Big Red
Rooter" button pinned to his
chest.
He enrolled at Stanford in
1949 and starred for three years
as a pitcher on the varsity baseball
team. He was MVP on the 1953
squad, a team that advanced to
the College World Series and has
often been called Stanford's
greatest ever.
He signed with Oakland of the
old Pacific Coast league
immediately following the college
series. He won his first four games

that year, the beginning of a
three-year stint in the minors that
brought a wealth of victories but
never a shot at the big leagues.
Youngest GM
He quit in 1955 and took a job
at U.S. Steel for a year and a half
before being named general
manager of the San Jose Baseball
Club. At 25 he was the youngest
general manager in the history of
organized baseball.
Then came a job as
Development Coordinator for
Fremont Hills Country and then
his own public relations and
management consultant business
before he joined Stanford's staff
in 1965.
He was Manager of Athletic
Relations for a little less than four
years and following Don
Liebendorfer's retirement in
January, 1969, he assumed the
title of sports information
director and became responsible
for all publicity and promotion
relating to Stanford's 13
intercollegiate sports.
Since then, he's been a major
contributor to the resurgence of
Stanford's football program.
New Ideas
"For years, all the promotion
was directed only to alumni. The
big thing we did was break out of
that old mold and try to attract
the entire community."
His main goal is to "get all our
guys as much attention as
possible," but he doesn't think his
influence can automatically turn a
good football player into an
All-American.
"I don't subscribe to the
feeling that I made Jim Plunkett a
Heisman Trophy winner. He won
the Heisman Trophy."
Still Murphy wears a 1971
Rose Bowl wrist watch with the
following inscription: "To Bob

Murphy, All-American maker.
Thank you — Jim Plunkett."
There have been times,
however, when the rewards
haven't been as great, when
"individual attention that
emanates from my office can be
divisive."
In 1971, most of the attention
went to quarterback Don Bunce,
linebacker Jeff Siemon and the
Thunderchicken defensive front
four, which received constant
publicity mainly because of Pete
Lazetich, "a never-ending press
conference himself," according to
Murphy.
Not All Roses
Nothing was outwardly wrong,
at least until the 1972 Rose Bowl,
when four defensive backs staged a
minor revolt by failing to have
their pictures taken at a Rose
Bowl picture day in Long Beach.
"What they were doing was
complaining as a group that they
didn't get enough publicity,"
Murphy recalls, and he admits
that it was a valid complaint. The
defensive backs were leading the
league in defense, but remained
unnoticed because of an
unconscious oversight.
That crisis lasted only one day,
but it proved the obvious point
that publicity can cause drastic
reactions. John McKay's remarks
after last year's Stanford-USC
game, for instance. Not too many
people remember that Stanford
last 30-21, but everyone knows
that the Trojans were hoping to
win "by 2,000 points."
Murphy made the initial
attempt to mend the scarred
relations between Stanford and
USC by recommending that
McKay be the principle speaker at
Stanford's senior athletes
banquet, a suggestion that elicited
responses like, "Jesus Christ,

they'll throw food at him."
McKay did come, and Murphy
thinks that inviting him "was one
of the best things we've done."
After this year's game McKay,
with tongue only slightly in
cheek, said that the Cards "were
very good sports," a comment
that represents a moral victory for

Bob Murphy's serious side.
So this afternoon, that task
accomplished, Murphy will return
to his old self, laughing, joking
and keeping his radio listeners
informed and amused.
And even though he says"I
don't really have time to be a
fan," he'll be rooting like hell.

Stanford's football program.
New Ideas
"For years, all the promotion
was directed only to alumni. The
big thing we did was break out of
that old mold and try to attract
the entire community."
His main goal is to "get all our
guys as much attention as
possible," but he doesn't think his
influence can automatically turn a
good football player into an
All-American.
"I don't subscribe to the
feeling that I made Jim Plunkett a
Heisman Trophy winner. He won
the Heisman Trophy."
Still Murphy wears a 1971
Rose Bowl wrist watch with the
following inscription: "To Bob

Murphy, All-American maker.
Thank you — Jim Plunkett."
There have been times,
however, when the rewards
haven't been as great, when
"individual attention that
emanates from my office can be
divisive."
In 1971, most of the attention
went to quarterback Don Bunce,
linebacker Jeff Siemon and the
Thunderchicken defensive front
four, which received constant
publicity mainly because of Pete
Lazetich, "a never-ending press
conference himself," according to
Murphy.
Not All Roses
Nothing was outwardly wrong,
at least until the 1972 Rose Bowl,
when four defensive backs staged a
minor revolt by failing to have
their pictures taken at a Rose
Bowl picture day in Long Beach.
"What they were doing was
complaining as a group that they
didn't get enough publicity,"
Murphy recalls, and he admits
that it was a valid complaint. The
defensive backs were leading the
league in defense, but remained
unnoticed because of an
unconscious oversight.
That crisis lasted only one day,
but it proved the obvious point
that publicity can cause drastic
reactions. John McKay's remarks
after last year's Stanford-USC
game, for instance. Not too many
people remember that Stanford
last 30-21, but everyone knows
that the Trojans were hoping to
win "by 2,000 points."
Murphy made the initial
attempt to mend the scarred
relations between Stanford and
USC by recommending that
McKay be the principle speaker at
Stanford's senior athletes
banquet, a suggestion that elicited
responses like, "Jesus Christ,

they'll throw food at him."
McKay did come, and Murphy
thinks that inviting him "was one
of the best things we've done."
After this year's game McKay,
with tongue only slightly in
cheek, said that the Cards "were
very good sports," a comment
that represents a moral victory for

Bob Murphy's serious side.
So this afternoon, that task
accomplished, Murphy will return
to his old self, laughing, joking
and keeping his radio listeners
informed and amused.
And even though he says"I
don't really have time to be a
fan," he'll be rooting like hell.

TWO SWINGERS—Stanford sports information director Bob Murphy
interviews two-time U.S. Open champ Lee Trevino on a Mutual Radio
Network golf broadcast. Murphy and Trevino are both known for
their short backswings and colorful senses of humor.
It was late one night on one of
those omnipresent football trips,
the ones that seem to make up at
least half of Bob Murphy's life,
and Stanford's sports information
director drove past a Seattle filling
station. A neon sign read
"Washington 20, Stanford 15."
So Murphy stealthily parked
his car, walked up to the sign and
rearranged the letters and
numbers. The new prediction —
"Snodfart 152, Washington 0,"
much to the delight of Stanford
alums who cruised by later that
evening.
Bob Murphy has been
entertaining Stanford alumni since
1965, when he first joined
Stanford's athletic staff. In fact
he's been entertaining the press,
coaches, players and friends
during those eight years —
everybody laughs when Bob
Murphy's on stage.
"There's far too much
seriousness in the world," Murphy
says, and he tries to remedy that
situation with a seemingly
unending arsenal of jokes, some
unprintable but all entertaining.
He tells them at banquets, booster
clubs and parties. He even tells the
printable ones on radio, as the
color man on KSFO's Stanford
football broadcasts, or on
Stanford and San Francisco 49er
television highlight shows or on
Mutual Radio Network golf
broadcasts.
Job's A Stage
"It's all provided me as a great
'stage' from which to represent
Stanford," he says, "but it's
funny because I never really
thought of muself as an
entertainer."
As sports information director,
Murphy must be an entertainer,
administrator and publicist. His
office puts out weekly releases
and statistics for the various
media, in addition to assuming the
difficult task of "keeping
everybody happy."
He is the "middle man" in the
often abrasive relations between
the coaches and the press, a role
that requires him to continually
assess his responsibilities to the
Univeisity, the coach, the athletes
and the media — responsibilities
he considers dead serious.
"It's hard when you have the
reputation of being a funny guy
for people to take you seriously. I
can see how lonesome a comedian
can be," he said.
Murphy's association with
Stanford began in 1931, when he
was born at Stanford Hospital,
presumably leaving the delivery
room with an "I'm a Big Red
Rooter" button pinned to his
chest.
He enrolled at Stanford in
1949 and starred for three years
as a pitcher on the varsity baseball
team. He was MVP on the 1953
squad, a team that advanced to
the College World Series and has
often been called Stanford's
greatest ever.
He signed with Oakland of the
old Pacific Coast league
immediately following the college
series. He won his first four games

that year, the beginning of a
three-year stint in the minors that
brought a wealth of victories but
never a shot at the big leagues.
Youngest GM
He quit in 1955 and took a job
at U.S. Steel for a year and a half
before being named general
manager of the San Jose Baseball
Club. At 25 he was the youngest
general manager in the history of
organized baseball.
Then came a job as
Development Coordinator for
Fremont Hills Country and then
his own public relations and
management consultant business
before he joined Stanford's staff
in 1965.
He was Manager of Athletic
Relations for a little less than four
years and following Don
Liebendorfer's retirement in
January, 1969, he assumed the
title of sports information
director and became responsible
for all publicity and promotion
relating to Stanford's 13
intercollegiate sports.
Since then, he's been a major
contributor to the resurgence of
Stanford's football program.

Stanford's athletic staff. In fact
he's been entertaining the press,
coaches, players and friends
during those eight years —
everybody laughs when Bob
Murphy's on stage.
"There's far too much
seriousness in the world," Murphy
says, and he tries to remedy that
situation with a seemingly
unending arsenal of jokes, some
unprintable but all entertaining.
He tells them at banquets, booster
clubs and parties. He even tells the
printable ones on radio, as the
color man on KSFO's Stanford
football broadcasts, or on
Stanford and San Francisco 49er
television highlight shows or on
Mutual Radio Network golf
broadcasts.
Job's A Stage
"It's all provided me as a great
'stage' from which to represent
Stanford," he says, "but it's
funny because I never really
thought of muself as an
entertainer."
As sports information director,
Murphy must be an entertainer,
administrator and publicist. His
office puts out weekly releases
and statistics for the various
media, in addition to assuming the
difficult task of "keeping
everybody happy."
He is the "middle man" in the
often abrasive relations between
the coaches and the press, a role
that requires him to continually
assess his responsibilities to the
Univeisity, the coach, the athletes
and the media — responsibilities
he considers dead serious.
"It's hard when you have the
reputation of being a funny guy
for people to take you seriously. I
can see how lonesome a comedian
can be," he said.
Murphy's association with
Stanford began in 1931, when he
was born at Stanford Hospital,
presumably leaving the delivery
room with an "I'm a Big Red
Rooter" button pinned to his
chest.
He enrolled at Stanford in
1949 and starred for three years
as a pitcher on the varsity baseball
team. He was MVP on the 1953
squad, a team that advanced to
the College World Series and has
often been called Stanford's
greatest ever.
He signed with Oakland of the
old Pacific Coast league
immediately following the college
series. He won his first four games

that year, the beginning of a
three-year stint in the minors that
brought a wealth of victories but
never a shot at the big leagues.
Youngest GM
He quit in 1955 and took a job
at U.S. Steel for a year and a half
before being named general
manager of the San Jose Baseball
Club. At 25 he was the youngest
general manager in the history of
organized baseball.
Then came a job as
Development Coordinator for
Fremont Hills Country and then
his own public relations and
management consultant business
before he joined Stanford's staff
in 1965.
He was Manager of Athletic
Relations for a little less than four
years and following Don
Liebendorfer's retirement in
January, 1969, he assumed the
title of sports information
director and became responsible
for all publicity and promotion
relating to Stanford's 13
intercollegiate sports.
Since then, he's been a major
contributor to the resurgence of
Stanford's football program.
New Ideas
"For years, all the promotion
was directed only to alumni. The
big thing we did was break out of
that old mold and try to attract
the entire community."
His main goal is to "get all our
guys as much attention as
possible," but he doesn't think his
influence can automatically turn a
good football player into an
All-American.
"I don't subscribe to the
feeling that I made Jim Plunkett a
Heisman Trophy winner. He won
the Heisman Trophy."
Still Murphy wears a 1971
Rose Bowl wrist watch with the
following inscription: "To Bob

Murphy, All-American maker.
Thank you — Jim Plunkett."
There have been times,
however, when the rewards
haven't been as great, when
"individual attention that
emanates from my office can be
divisive."
In 1971, most of the attention
went to quarterback Don Bunce,
linebacker Jeff Siemon and the
Thunderchicken defensive front
four, which received constant
publicity mainly because of Pete
Lazetich, "a never-ending press
conference himself," according to
Murphy.
Not All Roses
Nothing was outwardly wrong,
at least until the 1972 Rose Bowl,
when four defensive backs staged a
minor revolt by failing to have
their pictures taken at a Rose
Bowl picture day in Long Beach.
"What they were doing was
complaining as a group that they
didn't get enough publicity,"
Murphy recalls, and he admits
that it was a valid complaint. The
defensive backs were leading the
league in defense, but remained
unnoticed because of an
unconscious oversight.
That crisis lasted only one day,
but it proved the obvious point
that publicity can cause drastic
reactions. John McKay's remarks
after last year's Stanford-USC
game, for instance. Not too many
people remember that Stanford
last 30-21, but everyone knows
that the Trojans were hoping to
win "by 2,000 points."
Murphy made the initial
attempt to mend the scarred
relations between Stanford and
USC by recommending that
McKay be the principle speaker at
Stanford's senior athletes
banquet, a suggestion that elicited
responses like, "Jesus Christ,

they'll throw food at him."
McKay did come, and Murphy
thinks that inviting him "was one
of the best things we've done."
After this year's game McKay,
with tongue only slightly in
cheek, said that the Cards "were
very good sports," a comment
that represents a moral victory for

Bob Murphy's serious side.
So this afternoon, that task
accomplished, Murphy will return
to his old self, laughing, joking
and keeping his radio listeners
informed and amused.
And even though he says"I
don't really have time to be a
fan," he'll be rooting like hell.

TWO SWINGERS—Stanford sports information director Bob Murphy
interviews two-time U.S. Open champ Lee Trevino on a Mutual Radio
Network golf broadcast. Murphy and Trevino are both known for
their short backswings and colorful senses of humor.
It was late one night on one of
those omnipresent football trips,
the ones that seem to make up at
least half of Bob Murphy's life,
and Stanford's sports information
director drove past a Seattle filling
station. A neon sign read
"Washington 20, Stanford 15."
So Murphy stealthily parked
his car, walked up to the sign and
rearranged the letters and
numbers. The new prediction —
"Snodfart 152, Washington 0,"
much to the delight of Stanford
alums who cruised by later that
evening.

Murphy, All-American maker.
Thank you — Jim Plunkett."
There have been times,
however, when the rewards
haven't been as great, when
"individual attention that
emanates from my office can be
divisive."
In 1971, most of the attention
went to quarterback Don Bunce,
linebacker Jeff Siemon and the
Thunderchicken defensive front
four, which received constant
publicity mainly because of Pete
Lazetich, "a never-ending press
conference himself," according to
Murphy.
Not All Roses
Nothing was outwardly wrong,
at least until the 1972 Rose Bowl,
when four defensive backs staged a
minor revolt by failing to have
their pictures taken at a Rose
Bowl picture day in Long Beach.
"What they were doing was
complaining as a group that they
didn't get enough publicity,"
Murphy recalls, and he admits
that it was a valid complaint. The
defensive backs were leading the
league in defense, but remained
unnoticed because of an
unconscious oversight.
That crisis lasted only one day,
but it proved the obvious point
that publicity can cause drastic
reactions. John McKay's remarks
after last year's Stanford-USC
game, for instance. Not too many
people remember that Stanford
last 30-21, but everyone knows
that the Trojans were hoping to
win "by 2,000 points."
Murphy made the initial
attempt to mend the scarred
relations between Stanford and
USC by recommending that
McKay be the principle speaker at
Stanford's senior athletes
banquet, a suggestion that elicited
responses like, "Jesus Christ,

they'll throw food at him."
McKay did come, and Murphy
thinks that inviting him "was one
of the best things we've done."
After this year's game McKay,
with tongue only slightly in
cheek, said that the Cards "were
very good sports," a comment
that represents a moral victory for

Bob Murphy's serious side.
So this afternoon, that task
accomplished, Murphy will return
to his old self, laughing, joking
and keeping his radio listeners
informed and amused.
And even though he says"I
don't really have time to be a
fan," he'll be rooting like hell.
