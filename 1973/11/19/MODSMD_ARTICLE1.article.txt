# Human Bio Students Discuss Gombe Experiences
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
"I don't think people realize how individual chimps
are," said senior human biology major Nancy Merrick.
Merrick and three other students, senior Peter Meic and
graduate students David Riss and Harold Bauer, recently
discussed their experiences and impressions studying
chimpanzee behavior in Africa.
The four were among the eight students each year who
work with visiting Human Biology Prof. Jane Van
Lawick-Goodall at the Gombe Stream Research Center in
Tanzania. Goodall has conducted a continuous field study
of chimp behavior at Gombe since the early 60s, and in
the last few years has combined her work with Stanford's
program in human biology.
Although not without reservations, most veterans of
Gombe are pleased with their experience. Meic called his
nine-month stay "a basic, non-intellectual
education . . . without a doubt, the hardest experience in
my life."
Merrick was immediately struck by the surroundings
and climate at Gombe last August. The center is not deep
in the African jungle. It includes a variety of vegetation
not unlike the foothills behind Stanford. The area seemed
"like a big summer camp" until the beginning of the rainy
season, she said.
Frequent Illness
Riss pointed out that while veterans of Gombe tend to
give glowing reports, not all of the students there are
happy. One source of discomfort is frequent illness. Most
of those who go to Gombe suffer from malaria in some
degree, and digestive problems and intestinal parasites are
also frequent complaints. In fact, Meic was too ill to
function part of the time he was there, and never did

quite participate fully during his stay.
Another source of potential frustration is the nature of
the study. The students at Gombe are participating in a
long-range study, and do not see the immediate results of
their work. The major aim of the Gombe research is to
amass data over a long period of time, which does not
lend itself to immediate feedback on an individual
student's efforts.
A few students have been disappointed in the baboon
study. The chimp study is the most glamorous project at
Gombe, and the one for which enthusiasm is highest. By
comparison, the baboon study is still "young," and has a
less clear direction at the moment, according to Riss.
Friction
In addition, spending six months in a small, isolated
community like Gombe can cause some friction. This
proximity allows for anything from minor personality
clashes to severe competition. There have been cases
where students have actually competed for the chimps
they wanted to observe, and have not spoken to one
another for months.
Eight to ten human biology majors go to Gombe each
year, usually staying for six months. The students are
selected on the basis of applications, a required paper in
Dr. Goodall's class in primate behavior, and an interview.
In addition, prospective Gombe students must take at
least one quarter of Swahili, so they can conduct the
center's business in the nearby city of Kigoma or Dar Es
Salaam, the Tanzanian capital.
As in the Overseas Campuses program, students are
exposed to African culture in various ways. Meic
expressed his disappointment that many students "fly in
and fly out," never getting closer than necessary to the

countries and peoples around them.
Mother-Infant Relationship
Both Merrick and Meic were involved in one of
GoodalPs major projects at Gombe, the long-range study
of chimpanzee mother-infant relationships.
A typical day spent on this study begins before sunrise.
The observer follows the chimps until they nest for the
night, finding them in the morning before they wake.
Otherwise, one waits in the vicinity of the camp until the
chimps pass through, then follows them for the rest of the
day.
Detailed Records
While following the chimps, the observer keeps detailed
records, noting the number and frequency of certain
types of behavior.
Among the types of behavior recorded are
mother-infant playing, interaction with other infants or
older chimps and grooming.
According to Merrick, it takes "about a month" to tell
the chimps apart. Their characteristic postures, facial
expressions and behavior patterns are distinguishable
features. She insists that there are as many recognizable
differences among chimps as among people.
Researchers call all of the chimps at Gombe by name.
In most cases, they choose the names randomly, though
there are some exceptions. Mother-infant pairs often have
names beginning with the same letter, such as Flo and
Figan, Fifi and Freud, Pallas and Plato, and Passion and
Prof.
A venerable male with considerable white facial hair
was christened "Leakey" after the late Louis S.B. Leakey,
Goodall's mentor.
The chimps are not visibly affected by the presence of

the researchers. They generally ignore their human
observers. The students are instructed to avoid
interactions with the chimps, and if approached by
animals, to be passive and withdrawn.
Safety is an important consideration (even an
immature chimp can be a dangerously strong playmate).
Also, experimenters want to influence the chimps' natural
behavior as little as possible.
All of the students dismissed as "academic? the mere
presence of the observer affecting the chimps' behavior.
They point out that no significant differences have been
found between these studies and others which have
involved observation from a distance.
"When we do something inappropriate, it draws a
response from the chimps," Bauer commented. Any
sudden movements or loud noises will attract their
attention, he said. In addition, one might unknowingly
make a motion or facial expression which has an
intimidating or hostile analogue in chimp behavior.
But Bauer added quickly that such incidents are rare
and hardly ever endanger the observer. Students often
warn one another if a certain chimp is especially sensitive
to a certain signal.
Disruption
One source of disruption in the earlier stages of the
study was the feeding station near the camp. The feeding
station offered bananas daily, primarily to entice the
chimps into the camp for observation. In order to avoid
this disruption of their normal feeding patterns, the
feeding has been cut back to a weekly basis, just often
enough that the camp area is included in their normal
feeding routes.

CHIMP SPECIALIST — Visiting Human Biology Prof. Jane Van Lawick-Goodall
conducts a continuous study of chimpanzee behavior at the Gombe Stream
Research Center in Tanzania, Africa. Goodall invites eight students here to work
with her each year in examining chimp lifestyles.
After returning from Gombe, Merrick spent several
months conducting a similar observation of a
mother-infant pair in captivity. She studied a pair of
chimps in the population that will inhabit the Stanford
Outdoor Primate Facility at their temporary home, Lion
Country Safari, in Orange County, California.
While the other experimenters worked on
mother-infant relationships, Riss studied aggressive and
dominant behavior among adult males. This research
involved covering more area than the other studies, since
the males have a greater range of travel.

Tlie future of Gombe is uncertain. At present, the
Tanzanian government is in support of the center;
however, there has been pressure to make the area a
national park and open it to tourists. According to Meic,
this would not only affect the study, but "would be
disastrous for the chimps, which are susceptible to
virtually all human diseases."
Chimp populations in other parts of Africa are under
pressure, being hunted for food, pets and laboratory
research purposes. The chimpanzee, like most higher
primates, is now recognized as a threatened species,
though it does not appear on the official endangered
species list.
