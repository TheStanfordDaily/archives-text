# Advertising Policy Explained
## Editors Value Free Speech 
### 
Rich Jaroslovsky

Since the Daily's editorial
several weeks ago supporting the
United Farmworkers Gallo
boycott, several readers have
indicated their displeasure with
the paper's simultaneous decision
to continue accepting Gallo
advertising. The most recent of
these criticisms — and one of the
most typical — was James
Connolly's letter in the Nov. 13
Daily. Connolly contends that the
Daily is hypocritical in continuing
to accept Gallo ads, and that the
paper's "preference for advertising
profits over human justice is all
too clear."
Let's establish one thing
straight off. The members of the

Daily editorial board aren't
businessmen (although perhaps
sometimes Daily business staffers
wish they were). The editorial
board members — and by
extension, all editorial staffers —
aren't charged with the task of
making money; they're charged to
put out the best paper possible
and to make decisions based on
what's best for the Daily
journalistically, not profit-wise.
The discussion over advertising
policy was based on issues of
principle not of money. If Mr.
Connolly and others hint
otherwise, they are talking
through their collective hat.
The other issue raised is far
more difficult to deal with: is it
right to accept ads from
companies or organizations or
causes with which we disagree?
Mr. Connolly and others say no,
that it's "the heights of
hypocrisy." But suppose a
publisher refused to run an ad
supporting the Farmworkers
because he sided with the
growers?
Free Expression Threatened
The Farmworkers supporters
would howl — with justification —
that they were being denied the
opportunity to present their
message to the paper's readers.
Using Mr. Connolly's logic, the
San Francisco Chronicle, Los
Angeles Times, and about 90
percent of the nation's daily
newspapers should not have
accepted ads for George
McGovern last year.
I would contend that the
paper's responsibility is to provide
an equal opportunity for both
sides of issues to purchase space in
the paper. The paper is not an
ideological censor: if an ad is not
obscene under current court
criteria, or potentially libelous, or
otherwise legally troublesome, the
Daily should print it. That
includes Gallo as well as
Farmworkers supporters.
The final argument raised
against this policy is that "the
Daily, in its majestic liberalism,

invites the destitute as well as the
wealthy to purchase advertising
space" — implying that because
the Farmworkers and their
backers can't afford ads, they are
denied representation.
Pro- Farm workers
To this, I would suggest that
Mr. Connolly and friends count
the number of letters and
opinions columns the paper has
run backing the UFWU, besides a
number of editorials over the last
several years. One major reason
that the page is as open to
contributors as it is, is to insure a
voice for organizations and causes
not as economically powerful as
say, Gallo. I would hazard a guess
that the paper has run far, far
more pro-UFWU columns, letters
and editorials than it has Gallo
ads.
This debate would be less
ironic if in fact the Daily, and
most of its editorial board, did
not actually back the boycott.
Viewed in that light, it seems silly
to snipe at the paper.
The Gallo boycott is a subject
on which reasonable men might
differ. To try to shut off one
side's channels of communication
smacks more of restriction of free
expression of ideas than of a
struggle for human justice.
