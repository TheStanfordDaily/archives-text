In Jon Daunt's article,
"Anthropologists Ignore Indian
Culture," he asks: "Are there any
classes on poverty in the
Economics Department?"
He might be interested to
know that Gerald Meier, Professor
of Economics in the Graduate
School of Business, is concerned
with this problem, and has given a
freshman seminar on it,"The
Unity of Poverty, Domestic and

International." The course was
sponsored by the Committee on
International Relations.

White Plaza Vendors
Editor:
We were chagrined to learn in
the Nov. 8 issue of the Daily that
the University lawyers are trying

to remove the White Plaza vendors
claiming that the vendors might
be making a profit and thereby
threatening Stanford's tax status.
It is curious that the lawyers
have not noticed other
commercial enterprises on the
Stanford campus such as Wells
Fargo Bank, TDS Food Service,
Campus Bike Shop, and the shoe
repair shop.
Is it possible that the lawyers
may be less concerned with profit
making ventures than with
removing the crafts-people from
campus?

Beutelsbach Decisions
Editor:
Recently two items appeared
in the Daily which further obscure
the decision-making process on
Stanford-in-Germany. The first
item was Ezra Greenhouse's
article on the latest meeting of the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs. The presentation of
Prof. Craig's remarks suggested
that the CFSP had already
decided that the Beutelsbach
campus was deficient in the areas
he mentioned. Were this the case,
the CFSP would not have been so
eager to receive student feedback.
The Daily article mentioned
only two very minor points from
all that was presented in more
than an hour of prepared and
off-the-cuff statements by the
students present. Some of the
major positions centered on the
anthropological research now
coming to fruition in the
Remstaal area around
Beutelsbach, the unique
opportunities for the minimally
prepared student to speak German
(due to the family program), the
central position of Stuttgart in
terms of local and international
travel, the cultural offerings of
Stuttgart itself, and the success of
the program compared to a
former urban campus (Vienna).
Also stressed were the many
untapped possibilities offered by
the Beutelsbach area.

The discussion on courses
irrelevant to the culture was based
on the observation that many
courses were relevant and that all
should be made so. Students
praised individual courses as being
very worthwhile and commended
the German faculty of the
campus. The students contended
unanimously that the academic
and personal benefits they gained
were not indicated by books read
and papers written, but by the
integration of the course material
into the students interests and
intellectual life.
One of the main points
presented by students was that,
whereas many (and cheaper)
programs are offered to students
of specialized interests, a program
such as that now offered meets
the needs of the general Stanford
student who can't handle a
foreign university, or specialized
research on a semi-graduate level.
The second item in the Daily
was a letter written by Scott
Morrison, a member of my
Germany group (XXX) now
attending the University of
Stuttgart. His statements show a
common misconception of the
roles of both students and the
CFSP. First of all, the Overseas
Campus Office is not
"misinformed," but is weighing
many different viewpoints.
Secondly, the ultimate decision
about the campus does not rest
with the students, or even with
the CFSP, but with the President's
Office. The financial problems
involved in a semi-rural German
campus may prove
insurmountable. Therefore, a
"correct" decision may be that a
German campus, no matter how
valuable in terms of students'
college experiences, is infeasible.
Prof. Craig's closing comment
to students was "You have made
our decision very difficult." I have
been very impressed by the
sensitivity and thoroughness of
the committee, and I hope that
students will continue to discuss
their views with its members and
with other members of the
Administration.

major positions centered on the
anthropological research now
coming to fruition in the
Remstaal area around
Beutelsbach, the unique
opportunities for the minimally
prepared student to speak German
(due to the family program), the
central position of Stuttgart in
terms of local and international
travel, the cultural offerings of
Stuttgart itself, and the success of
the program compared to a
former urban campus (Vienna).
Also stressed were the many
untapped possibilities offered by
the Beutelsbach area.

The discussion on courses
irrelevant to the culture was based
on the observation that many
courses were relevant and that all
should be made so. Students
praised individual courses as being
very worthwhile and commended
the German faculty of the
campus. The students contended
unanimously that the academic
and personal benefits they gained
were not indicated by books read
and papers written, but by the
integration of the course material
into the students interests and
intellectual life.
One of the main points
presented by students was that,
whereas many (and cheaper)
programs are offered to students
of specialized interests, a program
such as that now offered meets
the needs of the general Stanford
student who can't handle a
foreign university, or specialized
research on a semi-graduate level.
The second item in the Daily
was a letter written by Scott
Morrison, a member of my
Germany group (XXX) now
attending the University of
Stuttgart. His statements show a
common misconception of the
roles of both students and the
CFSP. First of all, the Overseas
Campus Office is not
"misinformed," but is weighing
many different viewpoints.
Secondly, the ultimate decision
about the campus does not rest
with the students, or even with
the CFSP, but with the President's
Office. The financial problems
involved in a semi-rural German
campus may prove
insurmountable. Therefore, a
"correct" decision may be that a
German campus, no matter how
valuable in terms of students'
college experiences, is infeasible.
Prof. Craig's closing comment
to students was "You have made
our decision very difficult." I have
been very impressed by the
sensitivity and thoroughness of
the committee, and I hope that
students will continue to discuss
their views with its members and
with other members of the
Administration.

White Plaza Vendors
Editor:
We were chagrined to learn in
the Nov. 8 issue of the Daily that
the University lawyers are trying

to remove the White Plaza vendors
claiming that the vendors might
be making a profit and thereby
threatening Stanford's tax status.
It is curious that the lawyers
have not noticed other
commercial enterprises on the
Stanford campus such as Wells
Fargo Bank, TDS Food Service,
Campus Bike Shop, and the shoe
repair shop.
Is it possible that the lawyers
may be less concerned with profit
making ventures than with
removing the crafts-people from
campus?

Beutelsbach Decisions
Editor:
Recently two items appeared
in the Daily which further obscure
the decision-making process on
Stanford-in-Germany. The first
item was Ezra Greenhouse's
article on the latest meeting of the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs. The presentation of
Prof. Craig's remarks suggested
that the CFSP had already
decided that the Beutelsbach
campus was deficient in the areas
he mentioned. Were this the case,
the CFSP would not have been so
eager to receive student feedback.
The Daily article mentioned
only two very minor points from
all that was presented in more
than an hour of prepared and
off-the-cuff statements by the
students present. Some of the
major positions centered on the
anthropological research now
coming to fruition in the
Remstaal area around
