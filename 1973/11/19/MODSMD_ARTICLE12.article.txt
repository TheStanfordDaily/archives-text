# The 						Shit Hits The Fan
## Political Crisis Intensifies 
### 
Doyle McManus

It's "no fun being a pessimist.
But the last two weeks'
developments in the apparently
endless Watergate scandal leave
little choice.
Three factors contribute to the
growing sense of impending doom
among those of us who believe
that the cards of American
politics are generally stacked in
favor of those who hold power —
in this case, the President and his
partisans — and against those
without.
One is the remarkable affair of
the missing and obscured tapes.
Another is the enthusiastic
reaction the nomination of Gerald
Ford has gotten from Congress
and much of the press. And
another, oddly enough, is the
energy crisis.
All these make it less and less
likely that the Watergate cases will
be pursued to their ends; less and
less likely, hence, that the lesson
of Watergate will be fully learned
— less and less likely that the
American people will decide that
the centralization of ever greater
state power in an autocratic
militarist-industrialist executive
brings the Republic all too close
to that forbidden word, fascism.
First, the tapes.
We have known all along that,
since President Nixon has the
Watergate tapes in his possession,
it might be functionally
impossible for the courts to get
them intact. Mixed among the
howls of disbelief when Nixon's
lawyers announced that two of
the tapes were missing were the
wails of those who knew the
President could pull such a stunt,
but fervently hoped he wouldn't
dare.
But there's more than one way
to skin an investigation.
Background Noise
If the President ever does give
up a tape or two, significant

portions may be obscured or
altered. Rose Mary Woods, the
President's personal secretary,
testified recently that some of the
tapes suffered from such
background noise that she
could not make out what was
being said. The background noise,
Woods said, included bands
playing on the White House lawns,
people shuffling their feet, the
President whistling "during lulls in
the conversation," and the picking
up (and, presumably, the setting
down) of dishes.
The judicious reader will recall
that when we first learned of the
tapes, on July 16 of this year,
former Presidential aide
Alexander Butterfield - the man
who spilled the beans — said the
White House recording equipment
was sensitive enough to .pick up
whispers. No second-class tape
equipment for the greatest nation
on earth.
One reason for the startling
change — between Butterfield's
clear-as-a-bell tapes this summer
and Woods' clear-as-mud,
speak-louder-I-can't-hear-you
tapes this month — could lie in
the exigencies of sound
engineering.
Alteration Technique
There is only one way a tape
can be altered without detection
by experts. That is if the minute
impressions of the splices are
obscured by a high level of
background noise. A band playing
here, a President whistling there,
and suddenly whole sentences, or
even paragraphs, are safe from the
investigators' clutches.
Of course, we can choose to
believe Rose Mary Woods'
account. That leaves us the
ludicrous spectacle of the
President of the United States
calling a meeting, only to have it
disrupted by a band appearing

deus ex machina on the South
Lawn — a band, moreover, that
refuses to move; the President's
odd penchant for whistling old
show tunes during lulls in the
conversation; and a chorus of
apparently lunatic aides shuffling
their feet and clashing their
dishes, maybe in time.
In short, the President may be
able to keep us from the contents
of those tapes indefinitely. And
there's little we can do about it. If
they're lost (obscured), they're
lost (obscured).
Probable Confirmation
On the other hand, the
nomination of Gerald Ford to be
Vice President, which first looked
destined for months of
Congressional limbo, is fairly
winging toward confirmation.
It is a pity that the voices
calling for a full and exacting
consideration of Ford's
qualifications have not been
better heard.
The greatest product of the
Nixon administration — in
Watergate, in the bombing of
Indochina, in the attack on civil
liberties, in economic policies that
deny to the poor and guarantee to
the rich — has been a crisis of
confidence. No promise of tapes
or investigations can restore the
confidence that was undermined
by five years of destructive
policies. Only the promise of a
change in policies can.
More Of The Same
Gerald Ford represents no such
change. As minority leader in the
House, he has consistently hewn
to the Nixon line. He has urged
the same obedience to the
executive that distinguished the
White House staff; after the May
1972 announcement of the
mining of Haiphong harbor, he
said: "There is only one response
which would be proper and right
for the American people — to
support the President. . . what
ever the issue."
In foreign affairs, he has called
for "a policy of strength for
America,"and has led the
opposition to the recently-passed
War Powers Bill and to measures
to halt the bombing of neutral
Cambodia. He has been in the
forefront of efforts to limit
constitutional safeguards against
civil liberties, most notably in his
sponsorship of Nixon-inspired
preventive detention bills.
It is curious that his
nomination has been hailed by so
many "liberals" as a viable
alternative to President Nixon.
Even if Ford is confirmed, we
should at least ensure that we
know what we're getting. And
that, dear reader, is more of the
same.
Energy Crisis Effects
Finally, there's the energy
crisis. It is a terrible irony that the
nation should suffer a
near-complete loss of confidence
in its leaders when leadership is
needed most.
There are two apparent effects
the energy crisis may have on
American politics. Neither is very
good.
The first is that the nation,
shocked by the sudden, painful
crunch of short petroleum, will
rally around the only President
we've got. The possibilities of
rationed gas, dim lights, and a
cold winter have already stolen
our attention from tapes,
cover-ups, and dairy
contributions. This is what Mr.
Nixon would like, and he can be
expected to harp on the oil
producers' predicament like crazy.
Cultural Despair
The alternative is that the loss
of confidence will continue —
that, in crisis, the sense that
government has failed to provide
leadership will intensify. That
could make the next decade just
as interesting, politically, as the
last, as the mass of the populace
demands something new.
It could also lead to a politics
of cultural despair. The need for
political leadership can easily
become enthusiasm for a political
messiah; and messiahs, of course,
are as easily right wing as left.
If constitutional government is
seen as inadequate,
extraconstitutional government
will appear. It is a possibility
about which I cannot be sanguine.
