# Wooden's Wizards Will Win Again
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
First of Two Parts
For John Wooden, a veteran of
countless press conferences and
interviews, it was a routine
afternoon.
Seven conference coaches had
analyzed their teams at
yesterday's Pacific Eight
Basketball Press Day, cautiously
mixing superlatives with carefully
worded qualifiers. Meanwhile
Wooden sat patiently, jotting
down a few notes and
occasionally fidgeting with his
glasses. Mainly, though, he just
listened as his rivals spoke with
nearly universal optimism about
the upcoming season.
Then, when it was finally his
tum, the 26-year coach stood up
and proceeded to wipe the smiles
off seven previously hopeful faces.
UCLA is once again loaded
with talent — so loaded, in fact,
that one basketball magazine
picked Richard Washington as a
fifth team All-American and
Wooden said yesterday that
Washington had no chance to
start. Andre McCarter won't start
either, nor will Ralph Drollinger,
or Casey Corliss, or Marques
Johnson or Pete Trgovich.
Those six players, who

comprise the Bruin second string,
may be the second best team in
the conference.
The first string, of course,
should add an unprecedented
eighth straight NCAA title to
Wooden's long list of
achievements. "I don't think we'll
be any better than last year,"
Wooden said, but that statement
didn't exactly cause the seven
"other" coaches to start an
instantaneous celebration.
"We're physically improved —
we might have better players,"
Wooden said, "but as far as
working together, our team won't
be as strong."
It will be strong enough.
Joining seemingly superhuman
center Bill Walton in the tentative
starting five are forward Keith
Wilkes ("one of the great players
and great people I know,"
according to Wooden), forward
Dave Meyers and guards Tommy
Curtis and Greg Lee.
Curtis will direct the team
from the point position, with Lee
moving to the wing spot vacated
by Larry Hollyfield's graduation.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar,
whose 6-6 frame used to be the
tallest on the bench during past
Cardinal campaigns, is anxious to
start his second season as the

coach of the league's biggest team.
Last year, Stanford's young giants
recorded a 14-11 season, the
Farm's first winning effort in six
years.
This season, "we're a year
older, and we've got to be a year
better^' Dallmar said. All-League
center Rich Kelley, who spent
much of the early part of last
season throwing passes into the
bleachers, is now a seasoned
veteran — a player Dallmar says is
a sign of the Cards' 1973-74
maturity.
Complementing Kelley are post
men Mike Mann (6-9), Tim
Patterson (6-11) and 6-9
sophomore Ed Schweitzer, "one
of two really pleasant surprises."
The other surprise is 6-1 guard
Jim Montague, who spent most of
last season on the bench but
"right now would be a starter"
according to Dallmar. Guards
Melvin Arterberry and Mark
Gilberg, forwaid Dave Frost and
swing man Scott Trobbe further
brighten the Cards' outlook.
USC coach Bob Boyd raved
about his guards, but said that his
inside people "are the most
puzzling I've ever had because of
inconsistency." The guards — Dan
Anderson, Gus Williams and Biff
Burrell — all started at one time or
another last year. Williams is
"particularly improved,"
according to Boyd, and "may be

as good physically as anyone
we've had."
Up front Boyd must choose
two post men from the trio of
Mike Westra, Clint Chapman and
John Lambert. Chapman, the
team's leading scorer last year,
would seem to be a likely starter,
but Boyd said all three suffer
"from a great range of
inconsistencies." Bob Trowbridge,
a "rugged kid," will start
alongside the two whose
inconsistencies diminsh the most
before opening day.
Oregon, with five freshmen
coach Dick Harter thinks
comprise the best group of frosh
in the country, may be awfully
tough if Harter can achieve the
difficult task of blending the old
with the new.
Leading the old is All-League
guard Ron Lee, "a great
basketball player who has
improved at least 25 percent since
last year," according to Harter,
center Gerald Willett, guard Mark
Barwig and forward Ken Stringer.
One of the frosh, either Stu
Jackson or Steve Manker, will
start up front, and another rookie,
6-2, 140 pound guard Greg
Graham, "is going to be a heck of
a player."
Harter says his team is
inexperienced and that the Ducks'
"shooting and offensive
fundamentals are questionable,"
but 10,000 Oregonians bought all

the season tickets in just three
days when they went on sale last
June.
Those fans will be seeing
perhaps the nation's most physical
team (the Ducks were whistled for
innumerable fouls last year), but
Harter said that he doesn't think
his "is a radical approach to
basketball."

interviews, it was a routine
afternoon.
Seven conference coaches had
analyzed their teams at
yesterday's Pacific Eight
Basketball Press Day, cautiously
mixing superlatives with carefully
worded qualifiers. Meanwhile
Wooden sat patiently, jotting
down a few notes and
occasionally fidgeting with his
glasses. Mainly, though, he just
listened as his rivals spoke with
nearly universal optimism about
the upcoming season.
Then, when it was finally his
tum, the 26-year coach stood up
and proceeded to wipe the smiles
off seven previously hopeful faces.
UCLA is once again loaded
with talent — so loaded, in fact,
that one basketball magazine
picked Richard Washington as a
fifth team All-American and
Wooden said yesterday that
Washington had no chance to
start. Andre McCarter won't start
either, nor will Ralph Drollinger,
or Casey Corliss, or Marques
Johnson or Pete Trgovich.
Those six players, who

comprise the Bruin second string,
may be the second best team in
the conference.
The first string, of course,
should add an unprecedented
eighth straight NCAA title to
Wooden's long list of
achievements. "I don't think we'll
be any better than last year,"
Wooden said, but that statement
didn't exactly cause the seven
"other" coaches to start an
instantaneous celebration.
"We're physically improved —
we might have better players,"
Wooden said, "but as far as
working together, our team won't
be as strong."
It will be strong enough.
Joining seemingly superhuman
center Bill Walton in the tentative
starting five are forward Keith
Wilkes ("one of the great players
and great people I know,"
according to Wooden), forward
Dave Meyers and guards Tommy
Curtis and Greg Lee.
Curtis will direct the team
from the point position, with Lee
moving to the wing spot vacated
by Larry Hollyfield's graduation.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar,
whose 6-6 frame used to be the
tallest on the bench during past
Cardinal campaigns, is anxious to
start his second season as the

coach of the league's biggest team.
Last year, Stanford's young giants
recorded a 14-11 season, the
Farm's first winning effort in six
years.
This season, "we're a year
older, and we've got to be a year
better^' Dallmar said. All-League
center Rich Kelley, who spent
much of the early part of last
season throwing passes into the
bleachers, is now a seasoned
veteran — a player Dallmar says is
a sign of the Cards' 1973-74
maturity.
Complementing Kelley are post
men Mike Mann (6-9), Tim
Patterson (6-11) and 6-9
sophomore Ed Schweitzer, "one
of two really pleasant surprises."
The other surprise is 6-1 guard
Jim Montague, who spent most of
last season on the bench but
"right now would be a starter"
according to Dallmar. Guards
Melvin Arterberry and Mark
Gilberg, forwaid Dave Frost and
swing man Scott Trobbe further
brighten the Cards' outlook.
USC coach Bob Boyd raved
about his guards, but said that his
inside people "are the most
puzzling I've ever had because of
inconsistency." The guards — Dan
Anderson, Gus Williams and Biff
Burrell — all started at one time or
another last year. Williams is
"particularly improved,"
according to Boyd, and "may be

as good physically as anyone
we've had."
Up front Boyd must choose
two post men from the trio of
Mike Westra, Clint Chapman and
John Lambert. Chapman, the
team's leading scorer last year,
would seem to be a likely starter,
but Boyd said all three suffer
"from a great range of
inconsistencies." Bob Trowbridge,
a "rugged kid," will start
alongside the two whose
inconsistencies diminsh the most
before opening day.
Oregon, with five freshmen
coach Dick Harter thinks
comprise the best group of frosh
in the country, may be awfully
tough if Harter can achieve the
difficult task of blending the old
with the new.
Leading the old is All-League
guard Ron Lee, "a great
basketball player who has
improved at least 25 percent since
last year," according to Harter,
center Gerald Willett, guard Mark
Barwig and forward Ken Stringer.
One of the frosh, either Stu
Jackson or Steve Manker, will
start up front, and another rookie,
6-2, 140 pound guard Greg
Graham, "is going to be a heck of
a player."
Harter says his team is
inexperienced and that the Ducks'
"shooting and offensive
fundamentals are questionable,"
but 10,000 Oregonians bought all

the season tickets in just three
days when they went on sale last
June.
Those fans will be seeing
perhaps the nation's most physical
team (the Ducks were whistled for
innumerable fouls last year), but
Harter said that he doesn't think
his "is a radical approach to
basketball."

yesterday's Pacific Eight
Basketball Press Day, cautiously
mixing superlatives with carefully
worded qualifiers. Meanwhile
Wooden sat patiently, jotting
down a few notes and
occasionally fidgeting with his
glasses. Mainly, though, he just
listened as his rivals spoke with
nearly universal optimism about
the upcoming season.
Then, when it was finally his
tum, the 26-year coach stood up
and proceeded to wipe the smiles
off seven previously hopeful faces.
UCLA is once again loaded
with talent — so loaded, in fact,
that one basketball magazine
picked Richard Washington as a
fifth team All-American and
Wooden said yesterday that
Washington had no chance to
start. Andre McCarter won't start
either, nor will Ralph Drollinger,
or Casey Corliss, or Marques
Johnson or Pete Trgovich.
Those six players, who

comprise the Bruin second string,
may be the second best team in
the conference.
The first string, of course,
should add an unprecedented
eighth straight NCAA title to
Wooden's long list of
achievements. "I don't think we'll
be any better than last year,"
Wooden said, but that statement
didn't exactly cause the seven
"other" coaches to start an
instantaneous celebration.
"We're physically improved —
we might have better players,"
Wooden said, "but as far as
working together, our team won't
be as strong."
It will be strong enough.
Joining seemingly superhuman
center Bill Walton in the tentative
starting five are forward Keith
Wilkes ("one of the great players
and great people I know,"
according to Wooden), forward
Dave Meyers and guards Tommy
Curtis and Greg Lee.
Curtis will direct the team
from the point position, with Lee
moving to the wing spot vacated
by Larry Hollyfield's graduation.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar,
whose 6-6 frame used to be the
tallest on the bench during past
Cardinal campaigns, is anxious to
start his second season as the

coach of the league's biggest team.
Last year, Stanford's young giants
recorded a 14-11 season, the
Farm's first winning effort in six
years.
This season, "we're a year
older, and we've got to be a year
better^' Dallmar said. All-League
center Rich Kelley, who spent
much of the early part of last
season throwing passes into the
bleachers, is now a seasoned
veteran — a player Dallmar says is
a sign of the Cards' 1973-74
maturity.
Complementing Kelley are post
men Mike Mann (6-9), Tim
Patterson (6-11) and 6-9
sophomore Ed Schweitzer, "one
of two really pleasant surprises."
The other surprise is 6-1 guard
Jim Montague, who spent most of
last season on the bench but
"right now would be a starter"
according to Dallmar. Guards
Melvin Arterberry and Mark
Gilberg, forwaid Dave Frost and
swing man Scott Trobbe further
brighten the Cards' outlook.
USC coach Bob Boyd raved
about his guards, but said that his
inside people "are the most
puzzling I've ever had because of
inconsistency." The guards — Dan
Anderson, Gus Williams and Biff
Burrell — all started at one time or
another last year. Williams is
"particularly improved,"
according to Boyd, and "may be

as good physically as anyone
we've had."
Up front Boyd must choose
two post men from the trio of
Mike Westra, Clint Chapman and
John Lambert. Chapman, the
team's leading scorer last year,
would seem to be a likely starter,
but Boyd said all three suffer
"from a great range of
inconsistencies." Bob Trowbridge,
a "rugged kid," will start
alongside the two whose
inconsistencies diminsh the most
before opening day.
Oregon, with five freshmen
coach Dick Harter thinks
comprise the best group of frosh
in the country, may be awfully
tough if Harter can achieve the
difficult task of blending the old
with the new.
Leading the old is All-League
guard Ron Lee, "a great
basketball player who has
improved at least 25 percent since
last year," according to Harter,
center Gerald Willett, guard Mark
Barwig and forward Ken Stringer.
One of the frosh, either Stu
Jackson or Steve Manker, will
start up front, and another rookie,
6-2, 140 pound guard Greg
Graham, "is going to be a heck of
a player."
Harter says his team is
inexperienced and that the Ducks'
"shooting and offensive
fundamentals are questionable,"
but 10,000 Oregonians bought all

the season tickets in just three
days when they went on sale last
June.
Those fans will be seeing
perhaps the nation's most physical
team (the Ducks were whistled for
innumerable fouls last year), but
Harter said that he doesn't think
his "is a radical approach to
basketball."
