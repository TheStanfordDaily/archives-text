# Runnerup Tourney?
## 
### 
Pacific Eight commissioner
Wiles Hallock said yesterday that
pending approval of the league's
eight school presidents, the Pac-8
would participate in the first
annual Collegiate Commissioner's
Tournament following the
1973-74 basketball season.
The Commissioner's tourney,
scheduled for mid-March at the
St. Louis Arena (site of last year's
NCAA finals), will feature
second-place teams from eight
major conferences. The league
champion would play in the
NCAA tournament, with the
runnerup automatically qualifying
for the Commissioner's event.
Hallock said that teams
finishing below second in the
conference would still be eligible
for the National Invitation
Tournament in New York if
granted an NIT bid.
