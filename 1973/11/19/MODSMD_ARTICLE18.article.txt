# Cards Top Bears In JV Mud Bowl
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
BERKELEY — Playing a game
under extremely sloppy
conditions is not likely to induce
an artistic success, but Stanford's
junior varsity was quite pleased
with the form of its 14-0 win over
the California JV in the "Little
Big Game" Friday.
Blanking the Ramblers (as the
Cal team is called, for some
curious reason) brought the
Cardinals such joy that they
treated equally emotional coach
Gunther Cunningham to the
indignity of a bath in the mud
that was the middle of the
Memorial Stadium field.
From that same quagmire,
Mike Cordova had earlier
fashioned drives of 42 and 65
yards to give Stanford the two
touchdowns which, together with
Chip Underwood's extra points,
provided the margin of victory
and gave the Cards a 4-1 final
season record.
Not that winning was easy, by
any means. The poor field
condition (after steady rain up
until game time) negated much of
Cordova's passing effectiveness.
His timing with receivers was off
because of their poor footing, and
towards the end of the contest
Cordova was having trouble
handling the muddy ball on most
snaps from center.
Still, after the game the
mud-splattered Cunningham was
saying that team manager Mike
McGovern "was as much a part of
this win as anyone" because of his
work in keeping the ball as clean
as it had been.
'Plays To Win'
The ability to function under
unfavorable conditions "shows
something about Cordova,"
Cunningham said. "He plays to
win."
Stanford didn't get its first
score until the middle of the
second quarter, after Cordova hit
halfback Tom Oberhelman on a
32-yard pass over the middle to
put the ball at the Cal eight.
Three plays later, Cordova snuck
the ball over from the one.
Cordova threw to his halfbacks
often, for the first time this
season. Cunningham said he
instituted the strategy in practice
last week because "you can't run
patterns in this [ muddy field]."
The disrepair of Cal's field,
notoriously the worst in the
Pacific Eight during wet weather,
brought back memories of last
year's Big Game, when, under
similar conditions, the Bears
scored a last minute victory over

Stanford. Then, as now, cries were
heard for an artificial playing
surface.
Key Interception
After the Cards' first score,
linebacker Rick Brand intercepted
a Maurice Hamilton pass on the
first play of Cal's ensuing drive
and returned the ball to the
Rambler two. An off-sides call
against Cal moved the Cards one
yard closer, but four running
plays failed to gain the final three
feet, and Cal took over, standing
on its own goal line.
Neither team moved again until
the middle of the third period,
when Card Greg Smith (whom
Cunningham credited with doing a
"great job" after replacing
Oberhelman) cut to the grassy
right sideline and sprinted 30
yards. Two runs and three passes
later, Cordova hit split end Dave
Nagler on a 13-yard score.
The tally was Cordova's 11th
touchdown pass of the season,
Nagler's fourth TD reception.
Defense Praised
Stanford's defense, however,
was the main recipient of
Cunningham's praise after the
game. "Fifteen minutes of
practice the whole week and they
get out of it with a shutout.. ."
mused the coach.
Although he felt that the 41-10
trouncing of USC was his
defenders' best overall effort
during the season, Cunningham
felt that "as far as discipline and
carrying out of assignments" were
concerned, Friday's play was tops.
And so, on a day when playing
conditions might have allowed it
to be upset by an inferior team,
Stanford went out with its fourth
straight win. Cunningham credited
his "great coaching staff," saying,
"We feel we can adjust and do
things" when circumstances
dictate. *
Cunningham and his team have
now kept their vow, made after an
opening loss, never to lose again.
Still, amid the prideful chants of
"four and one!" heard after the
game, some pain must accompany
thoughts of that one that got
away, a 24-13 defeat by an
outplayed UCLA team.
Nagging thoughts — and a year
in which to think them.

towards the end of the contest
Cordova was having trouble
handling the muddy ball on most
snaps from center.
Still, after the game the
mud-splattered Cunningham was
saying that team manager Mike
McGovern "was as much a part of
this win as anyone" because of his
work in keeping the ball as clean
as it had been.
'Plays To Win'
The ability to function under
unfavorable conditions "shows
something about Cordova,"
Cunningham said. "He plays to
win."
Stanford didn't get its first
score until the middle of the
second quarter, after Cordova hit
halfback Tom Oberhelman on a
32-yard pass over the middle to
put the ball at the Cal eight.
Three plays later, Cordova snuck
the ball over from the one.
Cordova threw to his halfbacks
often, for the first time this
season. Cunningham said he
instituted the strategy in practice
last week because "you can't run
patterns in this [ muddy field]."
The disrepair of Cal's field,
notoriously the worst in the
Pacific Eight during wet weather,
brought back memories of last
year's Big Game, when, under
similar conditions, the Bears
scored a last minute victory over

Stanford. Then, as now, cries were
heard for an artificial playing
surface.
Key Interception
After the Cards' first score,
linebacker Rick Brand intercepted
a Maurice Hamilton pass on the
first play of Cal's ensuing drive
and returned the ball to the
Rambler two. An off-sides call
against Cal moved the Cards one
yard closer, but four running
plays failed to gain the final three
feet, and Cal took over, standing
on its own goal line.
Neither team moved again until
the middle of the third period,
when Card Greg Smith (whom
Cunningham credited with doing a
"great job" after replacing
Oberhelman) cut to the grassy
right sideline and sprinted 30
yards. Two runs and three passes
later, Cordova hit split end Dave
Nagler on a 13-yard score.
The tally was Cordova's 11th
touchdown pass of the season,
Nagler's fourth TD reception.
Defense Praised
Stanford's defense, however,
was the main recipient of
Cunningham's praise after the
game. "Fifteen minutes of
practice the whole week and they
get out of it with a shutout.. ."
mused the coach.
Although he felt that the 41-10
trouncing of USC was his
defenders' best overall effort
during the season, Cunningham
felt that "as far as discipline and
carrying out of assignments" were
concerned, Friday's play was tops.
And so, on a day when playing
conditions might have allowed it
to be upset by an inferior team,
Stanford went out with its fourth
straight win. Cunningham credited
his "great coaching staff," saying,
"We feel we can adjust and do
things" when circumstances
dictate. *
Cunningham and his team have
now kept their vow, made after an
opening loss, never to lose again.
Still, amid the prideful chants of
"four and one!" heard after the
game, some pain must accompany
thoughts of that one that got
away, a 24-13 defeat by an
outplayed UCLA team.
Nagging thoughts — and a year
in which to think them.
BERKELEY — Playing a game
under extremely sloppy
conditions is not likely to induce
an artistic success, but Stanford's
junior varsity was quite pleased
with the form of its 14-0 win over
the California JV in the "Little
Big Game" Friday.
Blanking the Ramblers (as the
Cal team is called, for some
curious reason) brought the
Cardinals such joy that they
treated equally emotional coach
Gunther Cunningham to the
indignity of a bath in the mud
that was the middle of the
Memorial Stadium field.
From that same quagmire,
Mike Cordova had earlier
fashioned drives of 42 and 65
yards to give Stanford the two
touchdowns which, together with
Chip Underwood's extra points,
provided the margin of victory
and gave the Cards a 4-1 final
season record.
Not that winning was easy, by
any means. The poor field
condition (after steady rain up
until game time) negated much of
Cordova's passing effectiveness.
His timing with receivers was off
because of their poor footing, and
towards the end of the contest
Cordova was having trouble
handling the muddy ball on most
snaps from center.
