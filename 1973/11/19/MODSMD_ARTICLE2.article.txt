# Nixon Collects Boos, Cheers In Watergate Counter-Offensive
## 
### 
MACON, Ga. (AP) — Marching his
Watergate counter-offensive into a
Southern stronghold yesterday,
President Nixon collected cheers and
petitions of support as well as boos
and shouts for resignation or
impeachment.
The journey into Georgia followed
a Saturday night news conference
where Nixon launched his public
effort to overcome the scandal, saying:
"I am not a crook." He appeared
before the Associated Press Managing
Editors Association.
The quick trip to Georgia was

officially to honor retired House
Armed Services Committee Chairman
Carl Vinson.
After a 24-minute speech at Mercer
University the President returned to
Key Biscayne, Fla.
At the airport, outside Macon a
crowd estimated at about 15,000
cheered and applauded, waving flags
and hand lettered signs urging the
President to "Hang In There."
Gets Petitions
Nixon was handed a sheaf of
petitions of support and said, "I am
terribly grateful."

Several thousand more supporters
hailed his motorcade as it drove to
Macon. But as Nixon's limousine
neared the campus a chorus of boos
rained from a crowd of several
hundred young people.
The crowd of mostly students
chanted, "Nixon Must Go," and "No
More Years," — a twist on Nixon's
re-election slogan of "Four More
Years."
Salutes Vinson
In his speech, the President, saluted
Vinson, who celebrated his 90th
birthday yesterday, and announced
that an aircraft carrier scheduled for
commissioning in 1980 will be named
the U.S.S. Vinson.
As he stepped from the chapel for
the return trip to the airport, another
chorus of boos and chants rang from
the crowd of several hundred students.
Four professors on the campus of
2000 students distributed a statement
saying they had planned to walk out as
Nixon began his chapel speech but
they were denied entrance although
they held printed invitations.
Protest Rally
A dozen other Mercer faculty
members addressed a rally to protest
Nixon's campus appearance. But a
larger number of faculty members
were among the more than 200

persons joining in the chapel
ceremonies.
White House advance men had
worked with local Nixon backers in
efforts to promote a show of support
for the President.
Addressing the crowd at the
airport, Nixon made no direct
reference to Watergate, concentrating
instead on his accomplishments in
foreign policy.
Defuse Mideast
He said the communications he
opened with the Soviet Union helped
defuse the Middle East crisis, saying
the two superpowers had decided to
talk about their differences rather than
fight about them.
Because of better relations with
Moscow and Peking, Nixon said, "I
believe we can build a peace that
lasts ... for a generation or more to
come."
The President was described by
advisers as buoyed by reaction to his
Saturday news conference and with
results of his series of private meetings
with Congressmen last week.
On the presidential jet en route to
Georgia, presidential chief of staff
Alexander M. Haig Jr. said, "There had
been tremendous reaction to the news
conference."

Several thousand more supporters
hailed his motorcade as it drove to
Macon. But as Nixon's limousine
neared the campus a chorus of boos
rained from a crowd of several
hundred young people.
The crowd of mostly students
chanted, "Nixon Must Go," and "No
More Years," — a twist on Nixon's
re-election slogan of "Four More
Years."
Salutes Vinson
In his speech, the President, saluted
Vinson, who celebrated his 90th
birthday yesterday, and announced
that an aircraft carrier scheduled for
commissioning in 1980 will be named
the U.S.S. Vinson.
As he stepped from the chapel for
the return trip to the airport, another
chorus of boos and chants rang from
the crowd of several hundred students.
Four professors on the campus of
2000 students distributed a statement
saying they had planned to walk out as
Nixon began his chapel speech but
they were denied entrance although
they held printed invitations.
Protest Rally
A dozen other Mercer faculty
members addressed a rally to protest
Nixon's campus appearance. But a
larger number of faculty members
were among the more than 200

persons joining in the chapel
ceremonies.
White House advance men had
worked with local Nixon backers in
efforts to promote a show of support
for the President.
Addressing the crowd at the
airport, Nixon made no direct
reference to Watergate, concentrating
instead on his accomplishments in
foreign policy.
Defuse Mideast
He said the communications he
opened with the Soviet Union helped
defuse the Middle East crisis, saying
the two superpowers had decided to
talk about their differences rather than
fight about them.
Because of better relations with
Moscow and Peking, Nixon said, "I
believe we can build a peace that
lasts ... for a generation or more to
come."
The President was described by
advisers as buoyed by reaction to his
Saturday news conference and with
results of his series of private meetings
with Congressmen last week.
On the presidential jet en route to
Georgia, presidential chief of staff
Alexander M. Haig Jr. said, "There had
been tremendous reaction to the news
conference."
MACON, Ga. (AP) — Marching his
Watergate counter-offensive into a
Southern stronghold yesterday,
President Nixon collected cheers and
petitions of support as well as boos
and shouts for resignation or
impeachment.
The journey into Georgia followed
a Saturday night news conference
where Nixon launched his public
effort to overcome the scandal, saying:
"I am not a crook." He appeared
before the Associated Press Managing
Editors Association.
The quick trip to Georgia was

officially to honor retired House
Armed Services Committee Chairman
Carl Vinson.
After a 24-minute speech at Mercer
University the President returned to
Key Biscayne, Fla.
At the airport, outside Macon a
crowd estimated at about 15,000
cheered and applauded, waving flags
and hand lettered signs urging the
President to "Hang In There."
Gets Petitions
Nixon was handed a sheaf of
petitions of support and said, "I am
terribly grateful."

Several thousand more supporters

Macon. But as Nixon's limousine
