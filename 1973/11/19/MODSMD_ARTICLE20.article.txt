# Attitude Hurts Cards
## Reno Cools Icemen 
### QUIGLEY S. PETERSON 
Stanford's ice hockey team
took it on the chin this past
weekend, losing twice to the
semi-pro Reno Aces at Squaw
Valley's 6200 foot Olympic ice
arena. Reno romped 10-3 Friday
evening and again 11-5 on
Saturday afternoon.
The altitude took its toll on
the Cards, who are used to playing
at the 35-foot elevation of
Belmont Iceland. Still, they
jumped on Reno for a 2-1 lead
after one period of play Friday on
goals by Pat Baldwin and Tom
Heckler.
Reno then blanked the Cards
4-0 in the second period. Twice
the Aces scored two goals within
two minutes, capitalizing on short
Stanford lapses. The third period
was no contest as Reno rolled up

the final 10-3 score.
Saturday afternoon a
determined Stanford team spotted
the Aces an early 3-0 lead.
Unfortumtely, Cardinal goalie
Kirk Palmer had only a
two-minute warm-up due to his
late arrival and, as a result, was
not sharp from the outset.
Stanford, however, did not roll
over and play dead. The Cards
fought back valiantly, trimming
Reno's lead to 4-3 after 12
minutes of the second period. But
a lapse similar to the previous
night's saw the Aces pop in four
goals during the next eight
minutes.
Fortunately, Reno is the
toughest squad the Cards, who are
now 5-3, will face this season.
Stanford squares off against
league-leading San Francisco
tomorrow at 8 p.m. at Belmont
Iceland.
