# Poloists End Season With 11-3 Loss To Cal
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The Cardinal water polo team concluded its season Friday by
losing to California, 11-3, at Stanford's new swim stadium. It marked
the fourth time that the Polo Bears have defeated the Cards this
season.
Cal maintained control throughout the game after jumping out to
an early 5-0 lead. John-Paul Roberts, with two goals, and Rick Gebers
accounted for the Cardinal scoring.
Stanford finished the year with a 0-6 Pacific Eight record,
obviously placing last in the conference. The Cards were 12-9-1
overall.
Stanford had started this season with hopes of going to the NCAA
tournament. Why did the Cards fail? "All the games were key games
as far as going to Long Beach was concerned," said coach Jim
Gaughran. "But the key game was the first game with UCLA. Even if
we had beaten USC both times, we still would have finished third
because we didn't beat UCLA."
Gaughran felt that the Cards should have beaten the Trojans both
times. "The best games we played were the USC games. In those
games we missed a lot of shots, and that made the difference."

The Cards will only lose three
players to graduation, however, so
Gaughran will have more
experience next year. "The team
learned a lot this year. I can
already see the enthusiasm. The
kids are already talking of spring
practice."
However Cal will not lose any
of its key players from a team
many call the best ever to play the
game. UCLA will lose Garth
Bergeson, their leading scorer.
USC will not lose anyone, so the
competition in the "Pac-4" will
not be any less difficult than it
was this year.
Rick Gebers, the player
Gaughran said was Stanford's
outstanding performer this season,
is one of the Card returnees.
"Rick came from junior college
and had to learn a whole new
system. But he adjusted and was
probably our top player."
Gaughran also praised seniors
Peter Snyder and Tom Warden,
who played extremely well this
season after sitting on the
Cardinal bench most of last year.
The Card offense was very
sporadic this year — Stanford
suffered a one-quarter letdown in
all its conference games. "The
offense will need a lot of work.
The kids will need to play
together .over the summer. Cal
does this and they play together,"
said Gaughran.
The "new" Cardinal poloists
helped considerably this year.
Gaughran praised freshman Drew
McDonald, Tom Purcell, Glenn
Procter and JC transfer Craig Van
Zandt.
Gaughran will lose goalie Doug
Tanner, a junior who will graduate
early. "Doug really came on
strong this year," said Gaughran.
"But Chris Dorst was an
outstanding goalie for the JV's,
and he should help our defense
next season."

times. "The best games we played were the USC games. In those
games we missed a lot of shots, and that made the difference."

The Cards will only lose three
players to graduation, however, so
Gaughran will have more
experience next year. "The team
learned a lot this year. I can
already see the enthusiasm. The
kids are already talking of spring
practice."
However Cal will not lose any
of its key players from a team
many call the best ever to play the
game. UCLA will lose Garth
Bergeson, their leading scorer.
USC will not lose anyone, so the
competition in the "Pac-4" will
not be any less difficult than it
was this year.
Rick Gebers, the player
Gaughran said was Stanford's
outstanding performer this season,
is one of the Card returnees.
"Rick came from junior college
and had to learn a whole new
system. But he adjusted and was
probably our top player."
Gaughran also praised seniors
Peter Snyder and Tom Warden,
who played extremely well this
season after sitting on the
Cardinal bench most of last year.
The Card offense was very
sporadic this year — Stanford
suffered a one-quarter letdown in
all its conference games. "The
offense will need a lot of work.
The kids will need to play
together .over the summer. Cal
does this and they play together,"
said Gaughran.
The "new" Cardinal poloists
helped considerably this year.
Gaughran praised freshman Drew
McDonald, Tom Purcell, Glenn
Procter and JC transfer Craig Van
Zandt.
Gaughran will lose goalie Doug
Tanner, a junior who will graduate
early. "Doug really came on
strong this year," said Gaughran.
"But Chris Dorst was an
outstanding goalie for the JV's,
and he should help our defense
next season."
The Cardinal water polo team concluded its season Friday by
losing to California, 11-3, at Stanford's new swim stadium. It marked
the fourth time that the Polo Bears have defeated the Cards this
season.
Cal maintained control throughout the game after jumping out to
an early 5-0 lead. John-Paul Roberts, with two goals, and Rick Gebers
accounted for the Cardinal scoring.
Stanford finished the year with a 0-6 Pacific Eight record,
obviously placing last in the conference. The Cards were 12-9-1
overall.
Stanford had started this season with hopes of going to the NCAA
tournament. Why did the Cards fail? "All the games were key games
as far as going to Long Beach was concerned," said coach Jim
Gaughran. "But the key game was the first game with UCLA. Even if
we had beaten USC both times, we still would have finished third
because we didn't beat UCLA."
Gaughran felt that the Cards should have beaten the Trojans both
times. "The best games we played were the USC games. In those
games we missed a lot of shots, and that made the difference."
