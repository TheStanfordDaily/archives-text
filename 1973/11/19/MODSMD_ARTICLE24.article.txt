# Cards Outlast Oregon, Insure Winning Mark
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Oregon coach Dick Enright
understated the truth by saying
"when you get onto sloppy fields
it isn't a seven-dollar game," but
Jack Christiansen wasn't
complaining after his team's 24-7
win over the Ducks Saturday.
"It was probably a little
tougher to forget the SC game
than we had thought," Chris said
of the relatively emotionless
battle. "But you know you've
done a good job defensively when
you shut the other team out."
A shutout? Well, neither
Christiansen nor just about any of
the 21,000 rain-soaked fans at
Stanford Stadium believes the
Ducks' lone touchdown was ever
scored.
On a fourth-and-two situation
late in the first half, Oregon QB
Herb Singleton tossed a pass to
tight end Russ Francis in the end
zone. Francis, who is as big and
quick as George Foreman, caught
this one as if he were wearing
boxing gloves, letting it bounce
out of his hands. The official,
however, ruled he had possession
long enough for the TD.
Cardinal comerback Jim
Kaffen, covering on the play
although he admittedly should
have been on the bench due to a
slight ankle sprain, said "it looked
like he dropped the ball on the
way down." But Stanford doesn't
really have anything to complain
about because its own first
touchdown was scored under even
stranger circumstances.
Took It Away
Mike Boryla underthrew Bill
Singler, open in the end zone.
Oregon free safety Steve Donnelly
apparently intercepted the pass,
but somehow Singler came back
to grab it for the touchdown.
"The defensive back
[Donnelly] had control of the

ball — he came down on his back
and the ball was just sitting on his
chest so I stole it away — it was
just a God-given play," Singler
said.
But Donnelly, while admitting
"it was a good play by the
receiver," thought "he I Singler |
didn't have control of it until he
went out of the end zone."
"Maybe the best thing at
halftime would have been 0-0,"
Christiansen said, instead of the
7-7 tie which actually did result.
Three Scores
The Cardinals pulled away in
the second half of the game,
played on a day which couldn't
decide whether to be sunny,
cloudy or rainy, but emphasized
the latter. Stanford, led by
Boryla, scored on all three
possessions it had in the third
quarter.
The first score was a 42-yard
field goal by Rod Garcia set up by
a streaking 37-yard Craig Zaltosky
punt return.
On the Cards' next possession,
Boryla flipped a pass to tight end
Glen Stone about 20 yards
downfield, and Stone eluded his
pursuers for 30 more yards. The
50-yard gain, the Cards' longest
this year, set up a two-yard TD
throw to tight end Brad Williams.
Then after a Forrie Martin
interception, split end Eric Test
threw 13 yards to Stone on a
reverse play. Boryla followed with
passes to Test and Williams, the
latter a 13-yarder that made it
24-7.
Top Players
Boryla, in all, hit 12 of 21
passes for 165 yards and three
touchdowns. His performance
earned him "offensive player of
the game" honors and left a scout
from the beleaguered Chicago
Bears practically drooling with
anticipation.
For the third time this year,
Pat Donovan won "defensive
player of the game" mention as a
result of his six tackles and five
assists. Another standout was
safety Doc Blanchard, who
intercepted a pass, batted away
another and made two tackles and

four assists. John Snider and
Kaffen also picked off passes.
Oregon, now 2-8 for the year
and 2-4 in the Pacific Eight, was
frustrated several times deep in
Stanford territory by the Cards'
defense.
The Ducks picked up 70 yards
on runs by freshman Rick Kane.
Kane gained most of his yardage
on sweeps to the weak side led by
pulling guard LeFrancis Arnold, a
243-pound monster.
"We got our winning season
today," Christiansen concluded.
The Cards are now 6-4 and can
finish ahead of last year's 6-5
mark despite a much tougher
non-conference schedule. "Next
week," said Chris, looking ahead
to the Big Game against
California, "we'll just try to add
to it."

didn't have control of it until he

"Maybe the best thing at

Three Scores
The Cardinals pulled away in
the second half of the game,
played on a day which couldn't
decide whether to be sunny,
cloudy or rainy, but emphasized
the latter. Stanford, led by
Boryla, scored on all three
possessions it had in the third
quarter.
The first score was a 42-yard
field goal by Rod Garcia set up by
a streaking 37-yard Craig Zaltosky
punt return.
On the Cards' next possession,
Boryla flipped a pass to tight end
Glen Stone about 20 yards
downfield, and Stone eluded his
pursuers for 30 more yards. The
50-yard gain, the Cards' longest
this year, set up a two-yard TD
throw to tight end Brad Williams.
Then after a Forrie Martin
interception, split end Eric Test
threw 13 yards to Stone on a
reverse play. Boryla followed with
passes to Test and Williams, the
latter a 13-yarder that made it
24-7.
Top Players
Boryla, in all, hit 12 of 21
passes for 165 yards and three
touchdowns. His performance
earned him "offensive player of
the game" honors and left a scout
from the beleaguered Chicago
Bears practically drooling with
anticipation.
For the third time this year,
Pat Donovan won "defensive
player of the game" mention as a
result of his six tackles and five
assists. Another standout was
safety Doc Blanchard, who
intercepted a pass, batted away
another and made two tackles and

four assists. John Snider and
Kaffen also picked off passes.
Oregon, now 2-8 for the year
and 2-4 in the Pacific Eight, was
frustrated several times deep in
Stanford territory by the Cards'
defense.
The Ducks picked up 70 yards
on runs by freshman Rick Kane.
Kane gained most of his yardage
on sweeps to the weak side led by
pulling guard LeFrancis Arnold, a
243-pound monster.
"We got our winning season
today," Christiansen concluded.
The Cards are now 6-4 and can
finish ahead of last year's 6-5
mark despite a much tougher
non-conference schedule. "Next
week," said Chris, looking ahead
to the Big Game against
California, "we'll just try to add
to it."

Ducks' lone touchdown was ever
scored.
On a fourth-and-two situation
late in the first half, Oregon QB

tight end Russ Francis in the end
zone. Francis, who is as big and
quick as George Foreman, caught
this one as if he were wearing
boxing gloves, letting it bounce
out of his hands. The official,
however, ruled he had possession
long enough for the TD.
Cardinal comerback Jim

although he admittedly should
have been on the bench due to a

earned him "offensive player of
the game" honors and left a scout
from the beleaguered Chicago
Bears practically drooling with
anticipation.
For the third time this year,
Pat Donovan won "defensive
player of the game" mention as a
result of his six tackles and five
assists. Another standout was
safety Doc Blanchard, who
intercepted a pass, batted away
another and made two tackles and

four assists. John Snider and
Kaffen also picked off passes.
Oregon, now 2-8 for the year
and 2-4 in the Pacific Eight, was
frustrated several times deep in
Stanford territory by the Cards'
defense.
The Ducks picked up 70 yards
on runs by freshman Rick Kane.
Kane gained most of his yardage
on sweeps to the weak side led by
pulling guard LeFrancis Arnold, a
243-pound monster.
"We got our winning season
today," Christiansen concluded.
The Cards are now 6-4 and can
finish ahead of last year's 6-5
mark despite a much tougher
non-conference schedule. "Next
week," said Chris, looking ahead
to the Big Game against
California, "we'll just try to add
to it."

Oregon coach Dick Enright
understated the truth by saying
"when you get onto sloppy fields
it isn't a seven-dollar game," but
Jack Christiansen wasn't
complaining after his team's 24-7
win over the Ducks Saturday.
"It was probably a little
tougher to forget the SC game
than we had thought," Chris said
of the relatively emotionless
battle. "But you know you've
done a good job defensively when
you shut the other team out."
A shutout? Well, neither
Christiansen nor just about any of
the 21,000 rain-soaked fans at
Stanford Stadium believes the
Ducks' lone touchdown was ever
scored.
On a fourth-and-two situation
late in the first half, Oregon QB
Herb Singleton tossed a pass to
tight end Russ Francis in the end
zone. Francis, who is as big and
quick as George Foreman, caught
this one as if he were wearing
boxing gloves, letting it bounce
out of his hands. The official,
however, ruled he had possession
long enough for the TD.
Cardinal comerback Jim
Kaffen, covering on the play
although he admittedly should
have been on the bench due to a
slight ankle sprain, said "it looked
like he dropped the ball on the
way down." But Stanford doesn't
really have anything to complain
about because its own first
touchdown was scored under even
stranger circumstances.
Took It Away
Mike Boryla underthrew Bill
Singler, open in the end zone.
Oregon free safety Steve Donnelly
apparently intercepted the pass,
but somehow Singler came back
to grab it for the touchdown.
"The defensive back
[Donnelly] had control of the

ball — he came down on his back
and the ball was just sitting on his
chest so I stole it away — it was
just a God-given play," Singler
said.
But Donnelly, while admitting
"it was a good play by the
receiver," thought "he I Singler |
didn't have control of it until he
went out of the end zone."
"Maybe the best thing at
halftime would have been 0-0,"
Christiansen said, instead of the
7-7 tie which actually did result.
Three Scores
The Cardinals pulled away in
the second half of the game,
played on a day which couldn't
decide whether to be sunny,
cloudy or rainy, but emphasized
the latter. Stanford, led by
Boryla, scored on all three
possessions it had in the third
quarter.
The first score was a 42-yard
field goal by Rod Garcia set up by
a streaking 37-yard Craig Zaltosky
punt return.
On the Cards' next possession,
Boryla flipped a pass to tight end
Glen Stone about 20 yards
downfield, and Stone eluded his
pursuers for 30 more yards. The
50-yard gain, the Cards' longest
this year, set up a two-yard TD
throw to tight end Brad Williams.
Then after a Forrie Martin
interception, split end Eric Test
threw 13 yards to Stone on a
reverse play. Boryla followed with
passes to Test and Williams, the
latter a 13-yarder that made it
24-7.
Top Players
Boryla, in all, hit 12 of 21
passes for 165 yards and three
touchdowns. His performance
earned him "offensive player of
the game" honors and left a scout

Bears practically drooling with
anticipation.
