More Mideast Meetings Scheduled
Egyptian and Israeli negotiators meet twice in the next
few days to discuss the U.N.-backed Egyptian demand for
restoration of the Oct. 22 cease-fire lines, U.N. officials
said yesterday.
Their statement in Cairo said an informal meeting is
scheduled for today and a plenary session later, probably
on Wednesday.
The usually authoritative Cairo newspaper A 1 Ahram
had reported earlier that Lt. Gen. Ensio Siilasvou, Finnish
commander of U.N. forces in the Middle East and
mediator in the Egyptian-Israeli talks, had postponed the
talks because of Israeli intransigence.
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar said, however, that
the A 1 Ahram report was unfounded and the negotiators
— Egyptian Lt. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Ghani Gamazy
and Israel's Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv — will meet today at
Kilometer 101 on the Cairo-Suez highway where all talks
alive been held since the signing of a cease-fire pact there a
week ago.
Europe Gets Temporary Oil Reprieve
VIENNA — Ten Arab oil nations decided yesterday to
give most of Europe a one-month reprieve in petroleum
cutbacks in recognition of a Common Market political
stand generally interpreted as pro-Arab.
The United States, Japan and the Netherlands were
excluded from the pause in the Arab oil cutback, imposed
in conjunction with the October Middle East war as a
means of pressure against Israel and its supporters.
That means that unless some new political
developments intervene, the pinch on oil deliveries to
Americans, Japanese and Dutchmen will continue
unabated.
The United States gets only about 10 percent of its
petroleum from the Middle East. But with the general
energy crisis, that margin has become increasingly
important.
;Europe and Japan depend heavily on the Arabs for oil,
however, and the cutback has raised fears of a serious fuel
shortage this winter.

Mansfield, Proxmire Seek Gas Ration
WASHINGTON — Two Democratic senators, including
the majority leader, said yesterday gasoline rationing must
be imposed.
They indicated that either an increased tax or higher
prices might also be needed to control its use.
"The American people have to face up to the
possibility of either rationing or, as some people in the
administration say, an added federal gasoline tax of 30 or
40 cents that would be added onto the five cents now
being paid," said Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield.
"This would be tripling or quadrupling the tax and it
would fall most on the poor and lower income, middle
class groups."
But, he agreed with the suggestion that rationing was
"the only way."
Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin said: "gas rationing
is essential. As it looks now we're going to have gasoline
rationing for at least a year or so."
Mansfield, of Montana, appeared on the NBC television
program "Meet the Press." Proxmire was on CBS' "Face
the Nation."
"I think that rationing by itself is not only
unattractive; it's not workable. I think you have to let the
price go up," Proxmire .-aid.
GM-UAW Bargaining Continues
DETROIT — Round-the-clock bargaining at the
sub-committee level began yesterday at General Motors
Corp. where the automaker was negotiating to avert a
walkout this morning b> some of its 415,000 United Auto
workers.
The union said last week it will terminate its national
GM contract at 10 a.m. local time and if there's no
agreement on a new pact, union leaders threaten to throw
a series of ministrikes at the auto giant.
As the deadline approached last night, bargainers
hadn't been to the main tables since Wednesday when
UAW President Leonard Woodcock said: "We're a long,
long way apart."
Union and corporate spokesman were quick to point
out that at GM the nuts and bolts bargaining is

traditionally done at the subcommittee level. Weary
negotiators had met all day Saturday at the subcommittee
level.
A news blackout was in effect.
Young Kennedy Improving
WASHINGTON — The son of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy was reported in satisfactory condition yesterday

Greek Marines Occupy Athens
ATHENS — Marines in battle uress moved into the
Greek capital yesterday to quell sporadic antigovernment
demonstrations, and the entire armed forces were placed
on full alert.
After dusk, when the martian law curfew went into
effect, the government announced that the death toll in
three days of student rioting had risen to nine.
The government announcement also said 128 persons
had been injured, although earlier reports from officials
put the figure at more than 300.

Yesterday was a day of hit-and-run rioting by
thousands of students near the Athens Polytechnic
Institute, where on Friday a four-day sit-in ended with a
riot by 15,000 students and workers calling for the
overthrew of President George Papadopoulos' regime.

Greek Marines Occupy Athens
ATHENS — Marines in battle uress moved into the
Greek capital yesterday to quell sporadic antigovernment
demonstrations, and the entire armed forces were placed
on full alert.
After dusk, when the martian law curfew went into
effect, the government announced that the death toll in
three days of student rioting had risen to nine.
The government announcement also said 128 persons
had been injured, although earlier reports from officials
put the figure at more than 300.

Yesterday was a day of hit-and-run rioting by
thousands of students near the Athens Polytechnic
Institute, where on Friday a four-day sit-in ended with a
riot by 15,000 students and workers calling for the
overthrew of President George Papadopoulos' regime.

More Mideast Meetings Scheduled
Egyptian and Israeli negotiators meet twice in the next
few days to discuss the U.N.-backed Egyptian demand for
restoration of the Oct. 22 cease-fire lines, U.N. officials
said yesterday.
Their statement in Cairo said an informal meeting is
scheduled for today and a plenary session later, probably
on Wednesday.
The usually authoritative Cairo newspaper A 1 Ahram
had reported earlier that Lt. Gen. Ensio Siilasvou, Finnish
commander of U.N. forces in the Middle East and
mediator in the Egyptian-Israeli talks, had postponed the
talks because of Israeli intransigence.
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar said, however, that
the A 1 Ahram report was unfounded and the negotiators
— Egyptian Lt. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Ghani Gamazy
and Israel's Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv — will meet today at
Kilometer 101 on the Cairo-Suez highway where all talks
alive been held since the signing of a cease-fire pact there a

Europe Gets Temporary Oil Reprieve
VIENNA — Ten Arab oil nations decided yesterday to
give most of Europe a one-month reprieve in petroleum
cutbacks in recognition of a Common Market political
stand generally interpreted as pro-Arab.
The United States, Japan and the Netherlands were
excluded from the pause in the Arab oil cutback, imposed
in conjunction with the October Middle East war as a
means of pressure against Israel and its supporters.
That means that unless some new political
developments intervene, the pinch on oil deliveries to
Americans, Japanese and Dutchmen will continue
unabated.
The United States gets only about 10 percent of its
petroleum from the Middle East. But with the general
energy crisis, that margin has become increasingly
important.
;Europe and Japan depend heavily on the Arabs for oil,
however, and the cutback has raised fears of a serious fuel
shortage this winter.

Mansfield, Proxmire Seek Gas Ration
WASHINGTON — Two Democratic senators, including
the majority leader, said yesterday gasoline rationing must
be imposed.
They indicated that either an increased tax or higher
prices might also be needed to control its use.
"The American people have to face up to the
possibility of either rationing or, as some people in the
administration say, an added federal gasoline tax of 30 or
40 cents that would be added onto the five cents now
being paid," said Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield.
"This would be tripling or quadrupling the tax and it
would fall most on the poor and lower income, middle
class groups."
But, he agreed with the suggestion that rationing was
"the only way."
Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin said: "gas rationing
is essential. As it looks now we're going to have gasoline
rationing for at least a year or so."
Mansfield, of Montana, appeared on the NBC television
program "Meet the Press." Proxmire was on CBS' "Face

the A 1 Ahram report was unfounded and the negotiators
— Egyptian Lt. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Ghani Gamazy

Kilometer 101 on the Cairo-Suez highway where all talks
alive been held since the signing of a cease-fire pact there a

Europe Gets Temporary Oil Reprieve
VIENNA — Ten Arab oil nations decided yesterday to
give most of Europe a one-month reprieve in petroleum
cutbacks in recognition of a Common Market political
stand generally interpreted as pro-Arab.
The United States, Japan and the Netherlands were
excluded from the pause in the Arab oil cutback, imposed
in conjunction with the October Middle East war as a
means of pressure against Israel and its supporters.
That means that unless some new political
developments intervene, the pinch on oil deliveries to
Americans, Japanese and Dutchmen will continue
unabated.
The United States gets only about 10 percent of its
petroleum from the Middle East. But with the general
energy crisis, that margin has become increasingly
important.
;Europe and Japan depend heavily on the Arabs for oil,
however, and the cutback has raised fears of a serious fuel
shortage this winter.

Mansfield, Proxmire Seek Gas Ration
WASHINGTON — Two Democratic senators, including
the majority leader, said yesterday gasoline rationing must
be imposed.
They indicated that either an increased tax or higher
prices might also be needed to control its use.
"The American people have to face up to the
possibility of either rationing or, as some people in the
administration say, an added federal gasoline tax of 30 or
40 cents that would be added onto the five cents now
being paid," said Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield.
"This would be tripling or quadrupling the tax and it
would fall most on the poor and lower income, middle
class groups."
But, he agreed with the suggestion that rationing was
"the only way."
Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin said: "gas rationing
is essential. As it looks now we're going to have gasoline
rationing for at least a year or so."
Mansfield, of Montana, appeared on the NBC television
program "Meet the Press." Proxmire was on CBS' "Face
the Nation."
"I think that rationing by itself is not only
unattractive; it's not workable. I think you have to let the
price go up," Proxmire .-aid.
GM-UAW Bargaining Continues
DETROIT — Round-the-clock bargaining at the
sub-committee level began yesterday at General Motors
Corp. where the automaker was negotiating to avert a
walkout this morning b> some of its 415,000 United Auto
workers.
The union said last week it will terminate its national
GM contract at 10 a.m. local time and if there's no
agreement on a new pact, union leaders threaten to throw
a series of ministrikes at the auto giant.
As the deadline approached last night, bargainers
hadn't been to the main tables since Wednesday when
UAW President Leonard Woodcock said: "We're a long,
long way apart."
Union and corporate spokesman were quick to point
out that at GM the nuts and bolts bargaining is

traditionally done at the subcommittee level. Weary
negotiators had met all day Saturday at the subcommittee
level.
A news blackout was in effect.

Greek Marines Occupy Athens
ATHENS — Marines in battle uress moved into the
Greek capital yesterday to quell sporadic antigovernment
demonstrations, and the entire armed forces were placed
on full alert.
After dusk, when the martian law curfew went into
effect, the government announced that the death toll in
three days of student rioting had risen to nine.
The government announcement also said 128 persons
had been injured, although earlier reports from officials
put the figure at more than 300.

Yesterday was a day of hit-and-run rioting by
thousands of students near the Athens Polytechnic
Institute, where on Friday a four-day sit-in ended with a
riot by 15,000 students and workers calling for the
overthrew of President George Papadopoulos' regime.

More Mideast Meetings Scheduled
Egyptian and Israeli negotiators meet twice in the next
few days to discuss the U.N.-backed Egyptian demand for
restoration of the Oct. 22 cease-fire lines, U.N. officials
said yesterday.
Their statement in Cairo said an informal meeting is
scheduled for today and a plenary session later, probably
on Wednesday.
The usually authoritative Cairo newspaper A 1 Ahram
had reported earlier that Lt. Gen. Ensio Siilasvou, Finnish
commander of U.N. forces in the Middle East and
mediator in the Egyptian-Israeli talks, had postponed the
talks because of Israeli intransigence.
