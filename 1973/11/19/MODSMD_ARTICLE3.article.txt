# USE Outlines Demands For New Contract
## 
### DON COX 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
published its first set of contract
demands last week calling for the
establishment of a $600 monthly
minimum wage and salary increases
averaging $260 per month.
The union, affiliated with the
Service Employees International
Union of the AFL-CIO, also included
provisions for a union shop,
cost-of-living increase, paid health
care, no layoffs and additional holiday
and vacation time in the proposed
contract.
Jim Berk, USE president and head
of the union negotiating team, termed
the demands "well within reason."
"By not paying us this money for our
jobs they are super exploiting us. They
owe us these wages," he declared.
'Lengthy Process'
Doug Barton, head of the
University's bargaining team, said
negotiations for a contract probably
will be "a lengthy process," taking
several months to complete.
He would not comment on the
union's proposals, because, he said,
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) rules state that the University
as an employer has an obligation to
respond to the proposals at the
bargaining table before publicly
commenting on the demands.
Berk said the union was not
interested in prolonging the
negotiations. He added that while the
union would be flexible in
negotiations, the demands were
"realistic."
Berk said he considers a strike
"possible," though he saw no
insurmountable issues at present.
"Sparks will fly most likely over the
cost-of-living escalator feature," he
said. This feature provides for
quarterly adjustment of salaries to
reflect increases in the cost of living.
Initial Response
While the University may request
clarification of certain contract
proposals, Barton indicated several
weeks would be needed to develop an
initial response to the demands, which
took the union more than four months
to formulate.
USE formulated its proposals after
it was formally certified June 15 as
bargaining agent for roughly
one-fourth of the University's
non-academic employees.
USE stated recently that its
membership now exceeds 1100. "We

should be able to do better in contract
negotiations than the firefighters and
police unions who negotiated
contracts last year," Berk said.
"The police didn't have the unity
to bring home the bacon, and the
firefighters were too small a group,"
Berk noted. "The results will be
different for us, partly due to our size,
and partly due to a different union
philosophy," said Berk.
USE is asking for salary increases as
high as 47 percent for some jobs. The
fire fighters received a 3.5 percent
increase in their settlement.
Future union demands may include
a comprehensive health plan. "We
hope for it to be established in the
next year,' noted Berk.
Permanent members of the
administration bargaining team are
Emil Sarpa, director of personnel and
employee relations for the University;
Doug Dupen, director of personnel for
SLAC; Earl Cilley, director of research
administration; Janet Sweet, manager
of government cost and rate studies;
and Barton.
