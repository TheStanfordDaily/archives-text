# College Newspapers Unite
## Students Endorse Impeachment 
### 
Eighty-four college and university
newspapers across the country today
endorsed the impeachment of
President Nixon.
In a joint editorial written by The
Amherst Student and mailed to the
members of Congress today, the
newspapers said Nixon's "mandate of
1972 has been buried in a legacy of

illegality, hypocrisy and deceit."
Writing in a letter which
accompanied the editorial, Student
editors said "In this time of national
crisis, the members of Congress must
overcome political timidity and put
aside partisan considerations. Their
duties under the Constitution are
clear. They fail to act at the nation's

peril."
Among the signatories of the
editorial are: The Stanford Daily, The
Harvard Crimson, the Yale Daily
News, the University of Chicago
Maroon, The Michigan Daily, the
Minnesota Daily and the MIT Tech.
Together the newspapers represent
more than one million students from
29 states. They have a combined
circulation of nearly 700,000.
The Student editors originally
decided to seek nationwide student
support for impeachment after Nixon
refused to turn over the Watergate
tapes to Judge John J. Sirica and fired
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and
Deputy Atty. Gen. William D.
Ruckelshaus.
The editorial said "these decisive
and unprecedented actions represent
the tactics of a military coup. They are
anathema to a rational democratic
policy."
The papers also cited Nixon's
impoundment of congressional
appropriations, the covert bombing of
Cambodia, the milk kickbacks and the
ITT affairs in their call for
impeachment.
Saying that the "members of the
academic community have a special
responsibility," the editorial asked
them to "impress upon congressmen
and other national leaders the gravity
of the situation and their duties under
the Constitution.
"Most importantly," the editorial
continued, "we must communicate the
strength of our convictions to the
public-at-large and join with othere in
a nationwide struggle for the
preservation of democratic rule."

LAKE LAGUNITA — Recent rain storms have dampened hopes for the traditional Big Game Bonfire as Lake Lagunita
has begun to fill up. Nevertheless, Cardinal expectations refuse to be watered-down for this Saturday's contest with the
California Bears at Stanford Stadium. Heavy rains also forced the cancellation of last year's Big Game Bonfire.
