# Arms Control Course Drops In Popularity
## 
### EZRA GREENHOUSE 
"Arms Control and Disarmament,"
an interdisciplinary program offered
by the political science and history
departments winter and spring
quarters, was never intended to be as
exclusive and secretive as the SALT
talks.
However, after a triumphal debut in
1970, when 200 students participated,
attendance has declined drastically.
Eighteen professors here are involved

in the program, and last year they
outnumbered students.
In an interview with the Daily,
Political Science Prof. Lawrence
Weiler, professional coordinator for
the program, suggested that the lack of
interest may be due to the withdrawal
of American troops from Vietnam.
"In 1970, anti-war feeling was at its
height, " he said. "People no longer
sense the urgency of limiting
qualitative advances in nuclear
weaponry."
Weiler, who jokingly refers to
himself as "the world's senior arms
controller," has been engaged in arms
research and negotiations since 1950.
When the Nixon Administration swept
the bureaucracy at the conclusion of
SALT I last year, Weiler accepted the
University's offer to head "Arms
Control and Disarmament."
Outlining the dimensions of the
program, Weiler maintained that
knowledge of the issues and
"vocabulary" of arms control was
essential to an understanding of real
and imagined national security
interests.
Asserting that the program did not
require a scientific background, Weiler
said that the political issues of arms
control were given a major emphasis.
Weiler said that students are taught
the "nature of a nuclear exchange,
what is calculable, and what is
incalculable." They learn the issues
involved in a comprehensive test-ban
treaty, and the concomitant national
means of verification, he added.
Faculty for the program, which
includes Genetics Prof. Joshua
Lederberg, a Nobel laureate; Prof.
Wol.'gang Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator; and
Business School Prof. Henry Rowen,
former head of RAND Corporation
plan next year to publish a textbook
on arms control.
The book, sponsored by a grant
from the Ford Foundation, will
include: a history of arms negotiations
between World War II and the present,
the development of deterrence, an
analysis of the institutions of arms
negotiations, and a study of chemical
and biological warfare.
Law Prof. John Barton, who has a
special interest in regional arms
control, said that faculty are also
collaborating on a documentary film
on arms control. Also sponsored by
the Ford Foundation, the film may be
purchased by National Educational
Television, he said.

Weiler said that students are taught
the "nature of a nuclear exchange,
what is calculable, and what is
incalculable." They learn the issues
involved in a comprehensive test-ban
treaty, and the concomitant national
means of verification, he added.
Faculty for the program, which
includes Genetics Prof. Joshua
Lederberg, a Nobel laureate; Prof.
Wol.'gang Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator; and
Business School Prof. Henry Rowen,
former head of RAND Corporation
plan next year to publish a textbook
on arms control.
The book, sponsored by a grant
from the Ford Foundation, will
include: a history of arms negotiations
between World War II and the present,
the development of deterrence, an
analysis of the institutions of arms
negotiations, and a study of chemical
and biological warfare.
Law Prof. John Barton, who has a
special interest in regional arms
control, said that faculty are also
collaborating on a documentary film
on arms control. Also sponsored by
the Ford Foundation, the film may be
purchased by National Educational
Television, he said.
"Arms Control and Disarmament,"
an interdisciplinary program offered
by the political science and history
departments winter and spring
quarters, was never intended to be as
exclusive and secretive as the SALT
talks.
However, after a triumphal debut in
1970, when 200 students participated,
attendance has declined drastically.
Eighteen professors here are involved

in the program, and last year they
outnumbered students.
In an interview with the Daily,
Political Science Prof. Lawrence
Weiler, professional coordinator for
the program, suggested that the lack of
interest may be due to the withdrawal
of American troops from Vietnam.
"In 1970, anti-war feeling was at its
height, " he said. "People no longer
sense the urgency of limiting
qualitative advances in nuclear
weaponry."
Weiler, who jokingly refers to
himself as "the world's senior arms
controller," has been engaged in arms
research and negotiations since 1950.
When the Nixon Administration swept
the bureaucracy at the conclusion of
SALT I last year, Weiler accepted the
University's offer to head "Arms
Control and Disarmament."
Outlining the dimensions of the
program, Weiler maintained that
knowledge of the issues and
"vocabulary" of arms control was
essential to an understanding of real
and imagined national security
interests.
Asserting that the program did not
require a scientific background, Weiler
said that the political issues of arms
control were given a major emphasis.
Weiler said that students are taught
the "nature of a nuclear exchange,
what is calculable, and what is
incalculable." They learn the issues
involved in a comprehensive test-ban
treaty, and the concomitant national
means of verification, he added.
