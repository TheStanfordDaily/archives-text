' assume, as did we, that the

authorities. However, events of
j recent years establish that the
- Ghtrro Case is not an exception:
violation of Citizens' rights is a
commonplace procedure,
particularly in political cases.
The Vietnam war and the
Watergate affair express the
contempt which political
leadership holds for democratic
rights and procedures, and the
criminal extent to which it will go
to retain power. A major
campaign by that leadership to
restrict democratic liberties is now
• apparent in the practice of "no
knock" -entry by police, the
authority for preventive detention
in Washington, D.C., and the
i,.pending "crime" proposals of the
Nixon and Reagan
The Chino Case is
an example of this campaign in
action.
Costly Defense
My concern for the case arose
initially because Andrea Holman
Burt is my daughter. As events
unfolded, and as we experienced

defense, we learned the virtual
impossibility for most people to
defend themselves when the
power of the state is arrayed
against them. We also came to
appreciate the corruption of
police and legal processes.
The complexities of the Chino
Case preclude detailed
description. However, a brief
outline is necessary to provide a
context for these conclusions. On
October 6, 1972, Ronald Beaty
escaped from the California
Institute for Men in Chino. One of
two guards transporting him was
killed. After learning of warrants
for their arrest, Andrea and
Douglas Burt surrendered on
October 23, 1972, asserting their
innocence. In July 1973 they
were convicted of second degree
murder in Superior Court of San
Bernardino County for alleged
participation in the escape.
Prior to his escape Beaty was
being assisted in legal work by
Doug Burt, who had known him
in prison, and by Andrea Holman
and Jean Hobson, who were active
in legal assistance to prisoners.
Beaty left letters from Andrea and
Jean in the police car from which
he escaped. The principal
prosecution witness was Beaty,
who pleaded guilty to first degree
murder. In return he received
dismissal of pending charges
against him for a prior escape. He
thus became eligible for parole in
seven years and received

assurances of police support in
seeking parole. This would free
him from prison earlier than
would have been likely under the
prior charges.
Previous Perjury
It was established during the
trial that Beaty had repeatedly
perjured himself in the past trials
and before the Grand Jury which
presented the indictment in this
case. It was also established that
in a previous escape Beaty had
kidnapped a young couple, sought
to have his companion kill one of
them, and later attempted to
incriminate the couple as his
accomplices. Prior to this second

escape, Beaty told other prisoners
that he had ingratiated himself
with a group of radicals whom he
could blame if his escape went
awry.
Beaty's testimony during the
present case changed many times
from the initial police
interrogation to the Grand Jury
hearing to the trial itself. These
changes made his description
increasingly consistent with the
version presented to the public by
the police authorities.
Nonetheless, major discrepancies
emerged between Beaty's story
and that of other eyewitnesses.
