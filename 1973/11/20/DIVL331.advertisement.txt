AT THE STANFORD BARN
Our Forte...Quality & Great Taste
featuring
The Original Leather Sneaker,
The Original Sockless Shoe.®
Bare Foot Gear are the first
shoes made for men who want the
look and feel of going without socks.
We think that's a good idea. Yet ——■
we can't literally guarantee that | > A 11 Tjjl
socklessness will be agreeable to XDxA.XIi.Ej
everyone, even in Bare /Foot T"l/"%
Gear. We wish we could. Jp
So, wear Bare Foot / Gear as
you want, without socks or with Ij l A T3
them. Either way, you'll have the VJIJGjaJLX\i
greatest feeling sneakers made; the
longest lasting, too. They wear at
least twice as long as cloth ones.
That's why you get extra laces.
