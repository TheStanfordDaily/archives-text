# Tuition Grants To Begin For Top Women Athletes

It will pay to be a woman athlete at
Stanford next year. The University
will award its first athletic scholarships
to women participating in Stanford's
six intercollegiate sports in 1974.
Until the spring of 1973, athletic
scholarships for women were
prohibited by the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletic for Women
(AIAW), as well as by social
convention. However, federal
legislation, law suits alleging
discriminatory practices and pressure
from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare helped spur the
change.
The AIAW will not ratify official
regulations governing women's athletic
scholarships until spring, but the
University is already establishing
policy for the program. Acting on
preliminary guidelines issued at the
AIAW conference held earlier this
month, Women's Physical Education
Department Chairman Pamela
Strathairn estimated that as many as
eight or nine women in any of six
intercollegiate sports will receive
scholarships next year.
By 1977, the department hopes to
support a total of 35 female athletes,
the maximum number allowed by the
AIAW. Women participating in
hockey, basketball, tennis, golf,
fencing and swimming will be eligible.
Title IX of the 1972 federal
educational amendments prohibits an
educational institution that is receiving
federal aid from determining benefits
or opportunities for students on the
basis of sex, race, creed, color or
national origin. This law apparently
compelled the change.
Action to establish equality
between men's and women's athletic
programs was under consideration here
long before the AIAW undertook its
rule change. This "philosophical
headstart" enabled Strathairn, the
Stanford delegate at the conference, to
engineer changes in the wording of
regulations to conform with Stanford's
administrative policies, she said.

The national organization's rules
will almost certainly require only a
one-year renewable commitment from
the University, according to
Strathairn. However, she said that,
barring a female athlete's ineligibility
for financial aid (a scholarship
eligibility requirement) or voluntary
withdrawal from sports, the
scholarships will be renewed as long as
the recipient remains an
undergraduate.
Provost William Miller is currently
considering a "gift opportunity
package" proposal to raise funds for
women's scholarships; Miller's assistant
Edward Shaw, anticipates the plan's
approval this week. The project will
then go to the General Secretary's
office for action.
Strathairn said she expects most of
the money for scholarships to come
from donations that don't specify the
sex of the recipient, perhaps from
estates or endowments. She feels Buck
Club members, who have financed
men's athletic scholarships since 1934,
are potential donors but stresses that
she does not envision an equivalent
organization for women.
Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz said
he does not expect Buck Club money
to be diverted for women's awards.
Like Strathairn, he thinks some money
for women will come from
endowments that support scholarships
for athletes of either sex.
Shaw, the intermediary between
the two departments, says he hopes to
achieve "a balancing in new
contributions" for athletic
scholarships. "There is no reason the
Buck Club can't contribute [to
women's athletic scholarships] if it
wants to," but it would come as a
shock to members if funds were
diverted from traditionally male
support without first consulting them,
he said.
Fund raising is an ever more
expensive business with tuition rising
$240 next year. This means the Buck

Club in 1974 will have to generate
$40,000-$50,000 more than it did this
year just to maintain its 1973 level of
support. It also means that the
women's department may need up to
$45,000 for nine possible "full-ride"
(tuition, room and board)
scholarships.
It is unlikely that all women will
receive "full-ride" scholarships in
1974, Strathairn said. Department
policy ties scholarship awards to
financial need, so no female athlete
who is able to attend the University
without financial assistance will be
eligible for a scholarship. Partial
scholarship support — grants, loans
and work — for female athletes
demonstrating financial need is apt to
be more common, she said.

Department Chairman Pamela
Strathairn estimated that as many as
eight or nine women in any of six
intercollegiate sports will receive
scholarships next year.
By 1977, the department hopes to
support a total of 35 female athletes,
the maximum number allowed by the
AIAW. Women participating in
hockey, basketball, tennis, golf,
fencing and swimming will be eligible.
Title IX of the 1972 federal
educational amendments prohibits an
educational institution that is receiving
federal aid from determining benefits
or opportunities for students on the
basis of sex, race, creed, color or
national origin. This law apparently
compelled the change.
Action to establish equality
between men's and women's athletic
programs was under consideration here
long before the AIAW undertook its
rule change. This "philosophical
headstart" enabled Strathairn, the
Stanford delegate at the conference, to
engineer changes in the wording of
regulations to conform with Stanford's
administrative policies, she said.

The national organization's rules
will almost certainly require only a
one-year renewable commitment from
the University, according to
Strathairn. However, she said that,
barring a female athlete's ineligibility
for financial aid (a scholarship
eligibility requirement) or voluntary
withdrawal from sports, the
scholarships will be renewed as long as
the recipient remains an
undergraduate.
Provost William Miller is currently
considering a "gift opportunity
package" proposal to raise funds for
women's scholarships; Miller's assistant
Edward Shaw, anticipates the plan's
approval this week. The project will
then go to the General Secretary's
office for action.
Strathairn said she expects most of
the money for scholarships to come
from donations that don't specify the
sex of the recipient, perhaps from
estates or endowments. She feels Buck
Club members, who have financed
men's athletic scholarships since 1934,
are potential donors but stresses that
she does not envision an equivalent
organization for women.
Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz said
he does not expect Buck Club money
to be diverted for women's awards.
Like Strathairn, he thinks some money
for women will come from
endowments that support scholarships
for athletes of either sex.
Shaw, the intermediary between
the two departments, says he hopes to
achieve "a balancing in new
contributions" for athletic
scholarships. "There is no reason the
Buck Club can't contribute [to
women's athletic scholarships] if it
wants to," but it would come as a
shock to members if funds were
diverted from traditionally male
support without first consulting them,
he said.
Fund raising is an ever more
expensive business with tuition rising
$240 next year. This means the Buck

Club in 1974 will have to generate
$40,000-$50,000 more than it did this
year just to maintain its 1973 level of
support. It also means that the
women's department may need up to
$45,000 for nine possible "full-ride"
(tuition, room and board)
scholarships.
It is unlikely that all women will
receive "full-ride" scholarships in
1974, Strathairn said. Department
policy ties scholarship awards to
financial need, so no female athlete
who is able to attend the University
without financial assistance will be
eligible for a scholarship. Partial
scholarship support — grants, loans
and work — for female athletes
demonstrating financial need is apt to
be more common, she said.

It will pay to be a woman athlete at
Stanford next year. The University
will award its first athletic scholarships
to women participating in Stanford's
six intercollegiate sports in 1974.
Until the spring of 1973, athletic
scholarships for women were
prohibited by the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletic for Women
(AIAW), as well as by social
convention. However, federal
legislation, law suits alleging
discriminatory practices and pressure
from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare helped spur the
change.
The AIAW will not ratify official
regulations governing women's athletic
scholarships until spring, but the
University is already establishing
policy for the program. Acting on
preliminary guidelines issued at the
AIAW conference held earlier this
month, Women's Physical Education
Department Chairman Pamela
Strathairn estimated that as many as
