## ARLO Motivates Student Research 
### 
â€¢ Newton & O'Grady

Over the past decade at
Stanford, student efforts to shape
their education to their own needs
and interests have generated a
number of innovations in the
curriculum. These innovations,
most notably SWOPSI and
SCIRE, have won substantial and
growing student support.
However, for most undergraduate
course work, it is still rare that
research assignments become
more than academic exercises,
having usefulness beyond the
intellectual development of the
student directly involved. As
important as this is, many
students need to feel that their
research is directed to the solution

of current human problems. When
this is the case, motivation and
involvement in the research are
markedly increased.
The Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) is an experimental
program to test the extent to
which research needed by
community organizations and
agencies can be adequately carried
out by students to fulfill normal
academic requirements. While
students spend countless hours
gathering information and
generating ideas that are never
used, many community
organizations have difficulty
finding the time and energy
necessary to conduct research that
would help them achieve their
goals. ARLO will identify research
projects needed by community
groups that could be performed
by students. It will work to make
students aware of appropriate
projects and will facilitate
communication between students
and the organizations so that
studies develop in accord with the
emerging needs and interests of
both.
By relating educational
pursuits to practical activity in the
community, ARLO's work should
enrich the student's academic
experience, heighten motivation
and broaden perspectives on
vocational and professional
possibilities. At the same time,
ARLO may help reduce the waste
of intellectual energy that occurs
when student research could be,
but is not, designed to contribute
to the solution of pressing human
problems.
ARLO will establish contact
with social action agencies and
determine which agencies could
constructively involve students in
their research programs. ARLO
staff will meet with these agencies
to identify projects which
students could realistically
accomplish, taking into account
such factors as the sponsoring
agency's time constraints,
students' time demands, the
agency's supervisory resources,
etc.
Information Resource
ARLO will publicize potential
research projects to students and
will put students with the
appropriate backgrounds and
interests in touch with the
sponsoring agency and, when it is
needed, with faculty members or
special studies programs (i.e.,
SWOPSI, Urban Studies, SCIRE)
willing to help supervise and
accredit the project.
ARLO will facilitate the
development and implementation
of research arrangements among
the student, the sponsoring
agency, and the faculty member
accrediting the project. An
agreement will be drawn up when
the project is launched so that

everyone involved will have clear
expectations for the project.
ARLO will also serve as a
resource office to students who,
for reasons other than wanting to
develop a research project, want
to find out what groups are active
in a certain area.
Research projects could, of
course, be arranged in many ways.
The two scenarios below illustrate
ways in which ARLO will
typically function.
(1) ARLO staff members
determine tht an organization
which disseminates information
on family planning needs data on
the demographic characteristics
and level of awareness of family
planning services among residents
of an inner city area where an
office will soon be established.
ARLO contacts a professor of
sociology who encourages six
students in his course on survey
techniques to carry out the
needed research to fulfill a term
paper requirement.
Link Provided
(2) A consumer advocate
organization requests investigation
into the physiological effects of
exposure to a new pesticide.
ARLO contacts a biochemistry
professor who encourages a
student to do his honors thesis on
this topic.
ARLO is sponsored by the
Associated Students of Stanford
University. Initial funding has

been provided by the ASSU
Council of Presidents, the ASSU
Senate, the Dean of Student
Affairs Initiative Fund, and a
private contributor. The office
will be staffed by a full-time
director. Secretarial support and
volunteer student help are also
anticipated.
The general direction of the
program will be established by the
ARLO Policy Board. The Board's
membership will include five
students and four faculty
members. The Policy Board is
envisioned not as a passive
decision-making body, but as a
working group which will assist
the ARLO staff in making
contacts with organizations,
students, and faculty members,
and in generating research
projects.
The student positions on the
ARLO Board are open to
undergraduate and graduate
students, and to student spouses.
Preferably, Board members will
have had some experience with
social action organizations and
with research projects.
Appliations are available now
in the ASSU office, Room 205
Tresidder and are due Monday,
December 3.

the ASSU Council of Presidents.

student in psychology.)
