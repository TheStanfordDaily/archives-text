Ford Opposes Workers
In keeping with his support of
outright fascist legislation, like
preventive detention without trial,
and in keeping with his support of
U.S. military intervention around
the world, Gerald Gord has
consistently voted against
workers: He led the 1965 fight
against the repeal of the
union-busting Taft-Hartley law, he
has opposed every minimum wage
bill, he has supported many
compulsory arbitration bills, he
strongly supported the 1971 bill
which forced West Coast
longshoremen to end their strike,
he led the fight to defeat the $20
million rat extermination bill
proposed in 1967 and he opposed
a senate bill to provide funds for
nutrition for the elderly.
Ford is pictured by the press as
a colorless but acceptable
compromise for vice-president. He
may be acceptable to the
"democratic" party establishment
whose primary concern is whether

he's a possible rival for the spoils
of the system in '76. However, his
record and his contempt for the
people makes him unacceptable to
most of us.
This contempt was revealed
once more last week when he said
that there is "no possibility"
President Nixon will resign or "be
swayed by the mob."

Unjust Sacrifice
Editor:
I can hardly believe that the
University is serious about closing
down the University residences
over the quarter break. Surely the
University has more respect for
the student as an individual than
to seriously propose to: 1) lock
several thousand students out of
their rooms for three weeks, 2)
force many students who live on
campus to leave, and 3) force
other students to allow strangers
to live in their rooms for the
duration of the break. I don't live
with my parents any more. My
home is where I am and I live here
and the thought that the
University is preparing to lock me
out of my home for three weeks
makes me furious.
The University may claim that
it can do this on the basis of the
rental contract we signed. Well, I
question the legality of any rental
agreement wherein, for the
purpose of saving power, the
landlord is given the right to
peremptorily lock the tenant out
of his apartment, deny him access
to his possessions, and then
possibly house someone else there
instead. I recognize that there is
an energy crisis, but Stanford is
home to a lot of students and I
don't see why they should be
forced to sacrifice more than
jother people in this society. That
:is, I don't see why most of them
'should be forced to relocate
themselves for three weeks if no
ione else is.
