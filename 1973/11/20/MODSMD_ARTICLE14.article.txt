# KZSU Shifts To Top-40 Format
## 
### JANET SWANBERG 
If you've tuned in to KZSU in
the past week, you may have
noticed an increase in popular
music. Gone are the days of the
ultra-progressive programming
style that gave disc jockeys full
rein over their music selection.
According to KZSU
Music Director Francis
Dickerson, the old free-form
programming "wasn't capturing
the community." So the station
has instituted a top-hit format
"designed to offer what students
want to hear."
The new format provides that
DJs must play a certain number of
cuts from top albums and singles
per hour. Two cuts per hour must
be chosen from a list of 30 "A"
albums, two from a list of 40 "A"
singles, and two from Billboard
Magazine's list of the top 200 LPs.
Lists of "A" albums and singles
are compiled weekly by
Dickerson. He chooses the area's
top selling hits and other current
music that caters to the college
community. DJs must also play
one cut from the Beatles, the
Rolling Stones, or Simon and
Garfunke! each hour.
"The format is not trying for
overall unity," said Dickerson. It
does not effect special programs

such as the "All Oldies" show, the
"Country-Bluegrass" show, or
other th e m e-o rien te d
presentations.
The 30 "A" albums in range
from Gilbert O'Sullivan and
Loggins and Messina to the Who
and Gladys Knight and the Pips.
Forty "A" singles range from
"Sail Around the World," by
David Gates to "D'Yer Maker,"
by Led Zeppelin.

In the past, KZSU DJs had
total freedom in their
programming. Dickerson noted
that the audience heard only the
type of music that the DJ liked.
Reaction to the format among
the DJs has been mixed. Junior
Eric Candelario described the
format as "very detrimental to the
station and personalities
involved... I like creating a
whole mood on my program, but

the rules are stifling," he said.
"The specified number of top hits
is going to turn KZSU into an AM
station like KFRC," said
Candelario. "I don't think it will
last," he added.
Sophomore Doug Townes
called the "A" singles list "too
restricting ... If we have to have a
list, it should be longer," said
Townes. But, he added, "for the
most part, I play the same music
with the format that I played
before."
Junior Craig Watts described
the format as "necessary action to
make KZSU more suited to the
general tastes of the
listeners ... The format is closer
to what our listeners want," Watts
said.
Program Director Mike Windes
said that he "received favorable
responses from the listeners" since
the format went into effect. Windes
noted that "call-in requests
increased."
The programming format was
presented at a Monday night
meeting on Nov. 5 and went into
effect on the next day.
After its first week, minor
refinements and changes were
added. Listener feedback is
welcomed.
