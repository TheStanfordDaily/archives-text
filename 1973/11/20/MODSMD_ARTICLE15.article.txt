# Flamenco Guitarist Exhibits Virtuosity
## 
### KENNETH DeLONG 
Last Friday evening the young
and very accomplished flamenco
guitarist Paco DeLucia exhibited
his powers before a capacity
audience in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. DeLucia's technical
equipment is incredible, and
during the course of the evening
the audience was treated to a
display of virtuosity rarely if ever
equaled.
The program consisted almost
completely of DeLucia's own
compositions. The pieces seemed
to be partly composed and partly
improvised, and consisted largely
of ringing changes on a variety of
traditional flamenco rhythms and
styles.
The success of these pieces as
music varied somewhat. Some of
them were extremely beautiful,
evoking a world of dark brooding
Spanish emotion, while others like
the Guajiras de Luis were full of
light-hearted fun. A few of the
pieces seemed rather vague in
their intention, a blemish of some
importance in such mood-oriented
music.
One of the greatest merits of
the concert was the relative
absence of the prolonged
pseudo-rhythmic strumming that
produces such a paralizing effect
on the psyche. What cliches there
were (and there were cliches),
were in general interesting and
often technically stunning. Only
in the encore were we treated to
real hard-core flemenco playing.
The result was a concert that
delighted the capacity crowd and
brought them shouting to their
feet at the end of the program.
DeLucia closed both halves of
his concert with pieces calculated
to impress. The first half
concluded with a Panderos by San
Lucar. Unlike the other pieces,
which were all taken from the
same large bag of tricks, this one
sounded for all the world like
Spanish Vivaldi. Baroque
figuration and rhythmic flow were

combined with specifically
flemenco techniques to produce a
really delightful hybrid.
In the final number, DeLucia
was assisted by another guitarist
(nameless) who played the ground
bass over which DeLucia
improvised brilliantly and at some
length. It was this final number
that best revealed his consummate
technical skill and musical
creativity.
Visually. DeLucia was also
gratifying. He was tall, casual, and
slightly disdainful. He wore high
boots (black, of course) as well as
the open frilly shirt that is simply
de rigeur for such occasions. He is
also fortunate in possessing that
slightly feverish tubercular look
which endears a Spanish artist to
the Western sensibility. The happy
combination of appearance,
technical wizardry, and the
management of S. Hurok Inc.,
should ensure a brilliant future for
this remarkable and gifted young
guitarist.

on the psyche. What cliches there
were (and there were cliches),
were in general interesting and
often technically stunning. Only
in the encore were we treated to
real hard-core flemenco playing.
The result was a concert that
delighted the capacity crowd and
brought them shouting to their
feet at the end of the program.
DeLucia closed both halves of
his concert with pieces calculated
to impress. The first half
concluded with a Panderos by San
Lucar. Unlike the other pieces,
which were all taken from the
same large bag of tricks, this one
sounded for all the world like
Spanish Vivaldi. Baroque
figuration and rhythmic flow were

combined with specifically
flemenco techniques to produce a
really delightful hybrid.
In the final number, DeLucia
was assisted by another guitarist
(nameless) who played the ground
bass over which DeLucia
improvised brilliantly and at some
length. It was this final number
that best revealed his consummate
technical skill and musical
creativity.
Visually. DeLucia was also
gratifying. He was tall, casual, and
slightly disdainful. He wore high
boots (black, of course) as well as
the open frilly shirt that is simply
de rigeur for such occasions. He is
also fortunate in possessing that
slightly feverish tubercular look
which endears a Spanish artist to
the Western sensibility. The happy
combination of appearance,
technical wizardry, and the
management of S. Hurok Inc.,
should ensure a brilliant future for
this remarkable and gifted young
guitarist.
Last Friday evening the young
and very accomplished flamenco
guitarist Paco DeLucia exhibited
his powers before a capacity
audience in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. DeLucia's technical
equipment is incredible, and
during the course of the evening
the audience was treated to a
display of virtuosity rarely if ever
equaled.
The program consisted almost
completely of DeLucia's own
compositions. The pieces seemed
to be partly composed and partly
improvised, and consisted largely
of ringing changes on a variety of
traditional flamenco rhythms and
styles.
The success of these pieces as
music varied somewhat. Some of
them were extremely beautiful,
evoking a world of dark brooding
Spanish emotion, while others like
the Guajiras de Luis were full of
light-hearted fun. A few of the
pieces seemed rather vague in
their intention, a blemish of some
importance in such mood-oriented
music.
One of the greatest merits of
the concert was the relative
absence of the prolonged
pseudo-rhythmic strumming that
produces such a paralizing effect
on the psyche. What cliches there
were (and there were cliches),
were in general interesting and
often technically stunning. Only
in the encore were we treated to
real hard-core flemenco playing.
