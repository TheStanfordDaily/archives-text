# P.A. City Council Boosts Budget
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Rising revenues from sales and
property taxes caused the Palo
Alto City Council last night to
vote to readjust its 1973-74
budget to reflect the increases.
Property taxes collected this
year will probably amount to
$2,566,000 which would be 2.9
percent more than originally
expected, according to George
Sipel, Palo Alto city manager.
Sales tax revenues may exceed
original estimates by $290,000 to
reach a level of $3,090,000.
Councilman John Beahrs noted
that the rise in revenue, reflects
more than inflationary trends.
The size of the increase is so large
that it reflects a real gain for the

city of Palo Alto.
In other action last night, the
Council voted unanimously to
endorse the formation of a
community group to plan series of
bicentennial observances for
1976.
"This is properly a community
effort, not a city Council effort,"
Mayor Kirke Comstock observed.
"After all, the revolution 200
years ago was undertaken by the
people of the country, and the
observance of that revolution
should also be the work of the
people."
Comstock said that the group
could serve as a vehicle for
coordinating formerly individual
observances and thereby could

avoid duplication of activities.
Councilman John Berwald
urged that diverse elements of the
Palo Alto community volunteer
their services in plans for the
bicentennial observances. He also
recommended that the people
planning the activities be called a
group rather than be referred to as
a committee.
Comstock said that no limit
should be placed on the number
of people in the group. He added
that details regarding its structure
will be decided later.
"It is not my intention to
establish any commitment of
funds at the outset," Comstock
said. "Late 1 / we can deal with
individual cases."

The Council also voted
unanimously to approve a 5
percent cost of living increase in
pensions for city employees who
retired prior to 1971. The
increased pension benefits will
cost $84,000 annually for the
next three years, according to Jay
Rounds, director of personnel
services. The benefits will be
administered by the Public
Employee Retirement System.
Noting the recent drops in the
stock market, Beahrs asked
Rounds whether the pension plan
could be amended if a severe
recession hit the nation. Rounds
explained that the state legislature
would then have the power to
make adjustments in the plan.
