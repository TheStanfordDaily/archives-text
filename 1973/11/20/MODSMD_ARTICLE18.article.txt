# Mahavishnu Overwhelms Crowd
## 
### RANDY BAKER 
BERKELEY — It is Saturday
morning and the sounds of Friday
night's Mahavishnu Orchestra
concert is still ringing in my ears. I
wonder what one can say in the
face of greatness and know that
words can never adequately
describe this concert.
It had all begun 8 p.m. Friday
at the Berkeley Community
Theatre with Mahavishnu John
McLaughlin introducing the band
and then asking the crowd for a
moment of silence. The Berkeley
crowd complied graciously and
after perhaps a full minute of
silence the first notes rang from
Bill Cobham's gong and were soon
joined by McLaughlin's guitar.
The music which followed in
the next hour and three-quarters
was completely overwhelming.
The Mahavishnu Orchestra plays a
unique type of instrumental
music, a high-powered, complex
mixture of jazz and rock.
Musically, they are the finest
group in America, featuring John
McLaughlin, the world's best
electric guitarist and Billy
Cobham, the best drummer in
rock music, plus Jerry Goodman
on violin, Jan Hammer on piano
and synthesizer, and Rick Laird
on bass.
All are very solid, professional
musicians. Although they are
excellent soloists, they are at their
best when all five play together.
They're as 'tight' a group as there
has ever been and it is essential to
their sound. When each is playing

a complex riff, often in something
as exotic as 11/8 time, its amazing
that it doesn't all fall apart.
Often it seems as if there are
millions of notes coming at the
listener per second as Goodman,
McLaughlin, and Hammer fiercely
trade riffs with Cobham pounding
out an intricate rhythm and Laird
providing the solid foundation. So
much happens at once that it is
hard to keep up with.
A Saint Possessed
Short-haired McLaughlin
stands in the center of the stage,
clad in white, like some kind of
saint, playing his double-necked
guitar like a man possessed. The
band's sound is exceptionally
loud.
Above all, there is a certain
intensity, as if each note will be
the last they'll ever play. Whereas
on their albums there are many
softer, mellow moments, the
intensity of their concert sound
does not let up for a moment.
Even the mellower tunes are
played with amazing force.
The concert was not without
its faults. While Hammer's
synthesizer solo and Cobham's
drum solo were among the
highlights of the night, there was
generally too much time devoted
to solos.
Conflict Within Group
This apparently stems from a
recent conflict between
McLaughlin and the other group
members. The other members felt
that McLaughlin gets too much

attention and that they should be
given more credit. This conflict
almost caused the group to break
up but apparently a compromise
has been reached; other group
members now solo more often
and Goodman and Hammer have
added their own compositions to
the group's repertoire (including
several of those played at Friday's
concert). Still, I feel that the solos
went too far and took away from
the group's total effect.
Another complaint I have was
about the choice of material: too
much of it was new and, due to
the complexity of the music, was
hard to grasp upon first hearing.
They didn't do all that much from
their most recent album, Birds of
Fire, and when they did it was
more as a frame for improvisation

than a strict interpretation of the
composition. Often apparenlty
new songs were mixed into and
combined with the old.
Audience Overwhelmed
Perhaps the best way of
describing the concert is to
describe its effect on the
audience. Usually after a rock
concert the crowd is buoyant,
loud, and rowdy; after this
concert the audience filed out in
nearly complete silence. Whether
they liked the music or not, they
were completely overwhelmed,
stunned, and emotionally drained.
In the end, it was an
experience quite unlike any other
concert I've ever been to. Whether
you care for their music or not,
the Mahavishnu Orchestra in
concert is something not to be
missed.

contrasts with his incandescent musical style, which he plays "like a

Cobham, the best drummer in
rock music, plus Jerry Goodman
on violin, Jan Hammer on piano
and synthesizer, and Rick Laird
on bass.
All are very solid, professional
musicians. Although they are
excellent soloists, they are at their
best when all five play together.
They're as 'tight' a group as there
has ever been and it is essential to
their sound. When each is playing

a complex riff, often in something
as exotic as 11/8 time, its amazing
that it doesn't all fall apart.
Often it seems as if there are
millions of notes coming at the
listener per second as Goodman,
McLaughlin, and Hammer fiercely
trade riffs with Cobham pounding
out an intricate rhythm and Laird
providing the solid foundation. So
much happens at once that it is
hard to keep up with.
A Saint Possessed
Short-haired McLaughlin
stands in the center of the stage,
clad in white, like some kind of
saint, playing his double-necked
guitar like a man possessed. The
band's sound is exceptionally
loud.
Above all, there is a certain
intensity, as if each note will be
the last they'll ever play. Whereas
on their albums there are many
softer, mellow moments, the
intensity of their concert sound
does not let up for a moment.
Even the mellower tunes are
played with amazing force.
The concert was not without
its faults. While Hammer's
synthesizer solo and Cobham's
drum solo were among the
highlights of the night, there was
generally too much time devoted
to solos.
Conflict Within Group
This apparently stems from a
recent conflict between
McLaughlin and the other group
members. The other members felt
that McLaughlin gets too much

attention and that they should be
given more credit. This conflict
almost caused the group to break
up but apparently a compromise
has been reached; other group
members now solo more often
and Goodman and Hammer have
added their own compositions to
the group's repertoire (including
several of those played at Friday's
concert). Still, I feel that the solos
went too far and took away from
the group's total effect.
Another complaint I have was
about the choice of material: too
much of it was new and, due to
the complexity of the music, was
hard to grasp upon first hearing.
They didn't do all that much from
their most recent album, Birds of
Fire, and when they did it was
more as a frame for improvisation

than a strict interpretation of the
composition. Often apparenlty
new songs were mixed into and
combined with the old.
Audience Overwhelmed
Perhaps the best way of
describing the concert is to
describe its effect on the
audience. Usually after a rock
concert the crowd is buoyant,
loud, and rowdy; after this
concert the audience filed out in
nearly complete silence. Whether
they liked the music or not, they
were completely overwhelmed,
stunned, and emotionally drained.
In the end, it was an
experience quite unlike any other
concert I've ever been to. Whether
you care for their music or not,
the Mahavishnu Orchestra in
concert is something not to be
missed.


INSPIRED — Mahavishnu John McLaughlin, guitarist with the
Mahavishnu Orchestra, plays one of the numbers from the group's
recent album Birds of Fire. McLaughlin's unassuming appearance
contrasts with his incandescent musical style, which he plays "like a
man possessed."
BERKELEY — It is Saturday
morning and the sounds of Friday
night's Mahavishnu Orchestra
concert is still ringing in my ears. I
wonder what one can say in the
face of greatness and know that
words can never adequately
describe this concert.
It had all begun 8 p.m. Friday
at the Berkeley Community
Theatre with Mahavishnu John
McLaughlin introducing the band
and then asking the crowd for a
moment of silence. The Berkeley
crowd complied graciously and
after perhaps a full minute of
silence the first notes rang from
Bill Cobham's gong and were soon
joined by McLaughlin's guitar.
The music which followed in
the next hour and three-quarters
was completely overwhelming.
The Mahavishnu Orchestra plays a
unique type of instrumental
music, a high-powered, complex
mixture of jazz and rock.
Musically, they are the finest
group in America, featuring John
McLaughlin, the world's best
electric guitarist and Billy
Cobham, the best drummer in
rock music, plus Jerry Goodman
on violin, Jan Hammer on piano
and synthesizer, and Rick Laird
on bass.
