# Musical 'Bodkins' A Good Adaptation
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
"Odd Bodkins," an original "musical comic" based upon Dan
O'Neill's comic strip of the same name, opened a new run in revised
form Saturday at the Palo Alto Community Theater.
The source of most of the dialogue is O'Neill's book Hear the
Sound of My Feet Walking . . . Drown the Sound of My Voice
Talking. Fred, the fearless Scorpio bird, and his sidekick Hugh, a
human of sorts, wander through a two-dimensional black-and-white
world brought out onto a stage, and the dialogue wanders from humor
to metaphysics to some of O'Neill's personal philosophy.
The high point of the show is Hugh and Fred's chance meeting
with a man in the road, played by Eric Wenburg. In a long monologue
punctuated by occasional reactions from Hugh and Fred, the man
takes them along on his personal journey through stages of violence,
despair, and ultimately to hope: "By recognition of my despair, I am
automatically on the road to hope." Wenburg handles this difficult
scene skillfully.
The music is entertaining, and includes rock, calypso, and bebop.
