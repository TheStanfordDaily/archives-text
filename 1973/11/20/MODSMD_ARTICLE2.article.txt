# Campus Figures Differ On ASSU Senate Role
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
University officials and student
government members agree that a
major goal of the ASSU Senate is to
represent student opinion to the
University, but they disagree sharply
on the best ways to carry out that
objective.
Dean of Student Affairs James

Lyons and his liaison with the Senate,
Dale Snape, called for greater use of
"informal channels" and more concern
for the issues confronting the
Senate-confirmed nominees who serve
on 35 University committees.
Lyons suggested informal
conversations with University officials,
seminars, eating meals with invited
guests, and open hearings on
important issues as ways to open up
these informal channels.
Several senators, however, said they
doubted that these methods, especially
the use of informal channels, are very
effective.
"We have to make use of both
formal and informal channels," Sen.
Maria Echeveste said. The University
doesn't always listen to students
through "informal" channels.
For example, she noted that she,
along with almost all the Senate, voted
for the recent resolution opposing the
proposed relocation of the office of
the Assistant to the President for
Chicano Affairs, a resolution which
drew criticism from President Lyman.
Valid Use
The resolution, she stressed, was a
valid use of formal channels to voice

student opinion.
Lyons, however, criticized the
resolution as "not the most effective
way of affecting change." He said he
thought informal channels would have
been more "personal and human" than
a resolution.
Both Snape and former ASSU Vice
President Brent Appel said they
thought the Senate should consider
issues before it more carefully.
Documented Research
Appel said he thinks the Senate
should carry out "carefully
documented investigation and
research." He said there has been too
little of this research in the past, but
he added that a lack of staff support
and money pose a major problem to
this task. He suggested that the Senate
could finance research by asking for a
larger fee assessment fee from the
student body. "If you give the Senate
no power and no money," then it's
very hard to expect it to accomplish
much, Appel said.
Sen. Rocky Barber said there is also
a problem in lack of coordination
between the Senate and the students
who serve on University committees.
