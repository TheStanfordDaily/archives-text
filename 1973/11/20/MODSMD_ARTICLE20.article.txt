# Singer Charms Boarding House Audience
## Anne Murray Gives 'Dynamite' Show 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
SAN FRANCISCO - Take a
spunky stick of dynamite, add six
fuses, and you create an explosive
Anne Murray Show.
Last Thursday evening,
"Richard," a group of six
adorable and talented guys got the
audience cookin' at the Boarding
House in a pre-show to the main
attraction, Anne Murray.
"Richard" has not only worked
with her on the road, but in the
studio as well, so it was no
wonder, then, why they jelled so
magnificently during her
performance. The group "used to
call themselves 'Dick,' but
changed it to 'Richard' because it
was longer." Whatever their name,
music was their game, as
expressed in the title cut of their
new album.
They kept the beat moving for
fifteen minutes, displaying
boundless ability and energy, both
vocally and in an instrumental
vein. The most exceptionally

talented member was Steve, from
Nova Scotia. He wrote most of
the group's songs, including a hit
from a film score which was an
award winner in Canada. Saxes,
bones, guitars, flute, harmonica,
and percussion combined in
generating a tuneful flavor of
jazz-rock, country/western-rock,
and a piece of pop-rock.
Funky Opening Number
Anne Murray burst into a
funky opener, "Hey, What About
Me?" The title seemed apropos,
although, this audience needed no
reminder that the show was just
beginning. Upon her very
entrance, they enthusiastically
received her. She, in turn, related
how impressed she was with San
Francisco. "As soon as I stepped
off the plane, I was welcomed by
two 4.5er5."
She admitted that the vibes in
this area were really nice, but,
unfortunately, something didn't
agree with her because she had
contracted the "green-apple
quick-step." If there was any

discomfort due to her condition,
it certainly didn't show.
In her easy-flowing, delightful
way, she sang old standards
("Snowbird," "Cotton Ginny,"
and "Break My Mind"), as well as
newer hits ("Danny's Song,"
"Killing Me Softly," and the
theme from the movie "Oklahoma
Crude").
New Loggins Song
Also, she "put out a few
feelers" on a new song written for
her by Kenny Loggins. It sounded
quite a bit like his "Danny's
Song," which she also recorded,
but had some interesting piano
work. "I Wanna Sing You a Love
Song" will be released November
26th, and given the audience

response, it should prove to be
quite popular.
Murray's versatility in singing
and guitar playing, and her
personality which was charmingly
witty while unassumingly cool,
spiced up the Show and at the
same time maintained the warmth
and spirit in the casual,
night-clubbish atmopshere.
After a fervent ovation from
the enraptured crowd, she gave
them an encore, "Everything's
Got to be Free."
The funky chick with her
funky back-up band was nothing
less than dynamite, and if anyone
tells you otherwise, don't blow
up. Just play it like Anne Murray
and keep cool.

personality which was charmingly
witty while unassumingly cool,
spiced up the Show and at the
same time maintained the warmth
and spirit in the casual,
night-clubbish atmopshere.
After a fervent ovation from
the enraptured crowd, she gave
them an encore, "Everything's
Got to be Free."
The funky chick with her
funky back-up band was nothing
less than dynamite, and if anyone
tells you otherwise, don't blow
up. Just play it like Anne Murray
and keep cool.
SAN FRANCISCO - Take a
spunky stick of dynamite, add six
fuses, and you create an explosive
Anne Murray Show.
Last Thursday evening,
"Richard," a group of six
adorable and talented guys got the
audience cookin' at the Boarding
House in a pre-show to the main
attraction, Anne Murray.
"Richard" has not only worked
with her on the road, but in the
studio as well, so it was no
wonder, then, why they jelled so
magnificently during her
performance. The group "used to
call themselves 'Dick,' but
changed it to 'Richard' because it
was longer." Whatever their name,
music was their game, as
expressed in the title cut of their
new album.
They kept the beat moving for
fifteen minutes, displaying
boundless ability and energy, both
vocally and in an instrumental
vein. The most exceptionally

talented member was Steve, from
Nova Scotia. He wrote most of
the group's songs, including a hit
from a film score which was an
award winner in Canada. Saxes,
bones, guitars, flute, harmonica,
and percussion combined in
generating a tuneful flavor of
jazz-rock, country/western-rock,
and a piece of pop-rock.
Funky Opening Number
Anne Murray burst into a
funky opener, "Hey, What About
Me?" The title seemed apropos,
although, this audience needed no
reminder that the show was just
beginning. Upon her very
entrance, they enthusiastically
received her. She, in turn, related
how impressed she was with San
Francisco. "As soon as I stepped
off the plane, I was welcomed by
two 4.5er5."
She admitted that the vibes in
this area were really nice, but,
unfortunately, something didn't
agree with her because she had
contracted the "green-apple
quick-step." If there was any

discomfort due to her condition,
it certainly didn't show.
In her easy-flowing, delightful
way, she sang old standards
("Snowbird," "Cotton Ginny,"
and "Break My Mind"), as well as
newer hits ("Danny's Song,"
"Killing Me Softly," and the
theme from the movie "Oklahoma
Crude").
New Loggins Song
Also, she "put out a few
feelers" on a new song written for
her by Kenny Loggins. It sounded
quite a bit like his "Danny's
Song," which she also recorded,
but had some interesting piano
work. "I Wanna Sing You a Love
Song" will be released November
26th, and given the audience

response, it should prove to be
quite popular.
Murray's versatility in singing
and guitar playing, and her
personality which was charmingly
witty while unassumingly cool,
spiced up the Show and at the
same time maintained the warmth
and spirit in the casual,
night-clubbish atmopshere.
