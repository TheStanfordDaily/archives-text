Saxbe's Eligibility Questioned
WASHINGTON — Three of four law school professors
testifying before a Senate committee said yesterday Sen.
William B. Saxbe, R-Ohio, cannot be made
constitutionally eligible, with the aid of a special bill, for
appointment as attorney general.
The assistant majority leader, Sen. Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia, told newsmen that "in fairness to Sen.
Saxbe," President Nixon should find someone else to head
the Justice Department.
After presiding over a Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing on a bill designed to hurdle a Constitutional
barrier to Saxbe's nomination, Byrd said the
administration should have explored the question of
Saxbe's eligibility before selecting him.
Saxbe was a member of the Senate in 1969 when the
attorney general's annual salary and that of other cabinet
members was increased from $35,000 to $60,000.
Under the Constitution, no member of Congress shall,
during the term for which he was elected, be appointed to
a federal office for which the salary has been increased
during that time.
The issue is not whether this bars Saxbe from
appointment until after his Senate term expires on Jan. 3,
1975, but whether an administration-proposed bill to roll
back the attorney general's salary to $35,000 would make
him eligible.
The Justice Department says the bill complies with the
Constitutional purpose because Saxbe would not benefit
from the 1969 salary increase.
Prof. William Van Alstyne, associate dean of the Duke
University Law School, supported this view.
But Profs. Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago
Law School, William Swindler of the William and Mary
College of Law and Dean Willard Lorensen of the West
Virginia University Law School disagreed.
They argued that the Constitutional prohibition is clear
and explicit and that Saxbe's disqualification cannot be
overcome by the special legislation.
Court Rejeets Reagan Welfare Plan
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's attempt to
implement a new federal welfare program for the aged,
disabled and blind without legislation was rejected by a
state appeals court yesterday.
The court said the administration would have to
continue full payments to the 500,000 recipients on its
own, pending passage of legislation.
This could cost the state an estimated $200 million
more a year in maintaining the program, some welfare
experts estimated. Welfare Director David Swoap said his
attorneys were trying to determine if that was true.
"We will have to continue with state-county
administration after Jan. 1, and it means that the grant
levels will be at least what they were in December,"
Swoap said.
But there's a chance the court order would raise

welfare payments even above the level proposed in
Democratic-sponsored legislation which the Republican
governor rejected last September.
For example, aid to the blind would have gone from an
average of $212 per month to $237 under the Reagan
plan. It would have gone to $250 under the Democratic
proposal but would be $252 under the court order.
The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled the Reagan
administration did not have the legal authority to put the
program into effect without legislation.
Eleven Die In Greek Riot
ATHENS — Soliders and troops rounded up scores of
youths and workers in a soccer stadium yesterday
following student-led riots that left 11 persons dead and
at least 148 persons injured.
Those apprehended — half of them construction
workers and local union leaders, according to one high
official — were taken to the stadium for questioning, then
released or taken to jails.
The number jailed was undisclosed.
The arrests appeared to indicate students won at least
some support from workers in their bid last week to
topple the army-backed regime led by President George
Papadopoulos.
Troops and tanks patrolled in Greece's three largest
cities — Athens, Salonica and Patras — enforcing the
martial law declared Saturday after bloody clashes
between police, troops and dissidents.
Oil Companies Held In Contempt
SACRAMENTO — Texaco and Mobil oil companies
were held in contempt of the legislature yesterday for
•refusing to release data on crude oil pricing.
A joint subcommittee investigating oil leases on the
state-owned lands voted the contempt order after a Los
Angeles court rejected the companies' attempt to quash
the subcommittee's subpoenas.
A third oil company, Exxon, asked the subcommittee
for a delay to give it more time to decide whether it
would provide the subpoenaed data.
Subcommittee chairman Kenneth Cory said the firms
were buying oil through leases with the state at
below-market prices. He said the purpose of the
subpoenas was to determine whether state law should be
changed to give California more favorable oil lease
contracts.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness today with rain likely by late
afternoon or evening and continuing on and off tonight
and tomorrow. Continued cool. Lows tonight in mid 40s
to mid 50s. Highs both days in mid 50s to lower 60s.
Northwest wind 5 to 15 mph becoming southerly today
increasing to 15 to. 30 mph late this afternoon. Chance of
rain 30 percent today and 70 percent tonight.

Court Rejeets Reagan Welfare Plan
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's attempt to
implement a new federal welfare program for the aged,
disabled and blind without legislation was rejected by a
state appeals court yesterday.
The court said the administration would have to
continue full payments to the 500,000 recipients on its
own, pending passage of legislation.
This could cost the state an estimated $200 million
more a year in maintaining the program, some welfare
experts estimated. Welfare Director David Swoap said his
attorneys were trying to determine if that was true.
"We will have to continue with state-county
administration after Jan. 1, and it means that the grant
levels will be at least what they were in December,"
Swoap said.
But there's a chance the court order would raise

welfare payments even above the level proposed in
Democratic-sponsored legislation which the Republican
governor rejected last September.
For example, aid to the blind would have gone from an
average of $212 per month to $237 under the Reagan
plan. It would have gone to $250 under the Democratic
proposal but would be $252 under the court order.
The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled the Reagan
administration did not have the legal authority to put the
program into effect without legislation.
Eleven Die In Greek Riot
ATHENS — Soliders and troops rounded up scores of
youths and workers in a soccer stadium yesterday
following student-led riots that left 11 persons dead and
at least 148 persons injured.
Those apprehended — half of them construction
workers and local union leaders, according to one high
official — were taken to the stadium for questioning, then
released or taken to jails.
The number jailed was undisclosed.
The arrests appeared to indicate students won at least
some support from workers in their bid last week to
topple the army-backed regime led by President George
Papadopoulos.
Troops and tanks patrolled in Greece's three largest
cities — Athens, Salonica and Patras — enforcing the
martial law declared Saturday after bloody clashes
between police, troops and dissidents.
Oil Companies Held In Contempt
SACRAMENTO — Texaco and Mobil oil companies
were held in contempt of the legislature yesterday for
•refusing to release data on crude oil pricing.
A joint subcommittee investigating oil leases on the
state-owned lands voted the contempt order after a Los
Angeles court rejected the companies' attempt to quash
the subcommittee's subpoenas.
A third oil company, Exxon, asked the subcommittee
for a delay to give it more time to decide whether it
would provide the subpoenaed data.
Subcommittee chairman Kenneth Cory said the firms
were buying oil through leases with the state at
below-market prices. He said the purpose of the
subpoenas was to determine whether state law should be
changed to give California more favorable oil lease
contracts.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness today with rain likely by late
afternoon or evening and continuing on and off tonight
and tomorrow. Continued cool. Lows tonight in mid 40s
to mid 50s. Highs both days in mid 50s to lower 60s.
Northwest wind 5 to 15 mph becoming southerly today
increasing to 15 to. 30 mph late this afternoon. Chance of
rain 30 percent today and 70 percent tonight.
Saxbe's Eligibility Questioned
WASHINGTON — Three of four law school professors
testifying before a Senate committee said yesterday Sen.
William B. Saxbe, R-Ohio, cannot be made
constitutionally eligible, with the aid of a special bill, for
appointment as attorney general.
The assistant majority leader, Sen. Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia, told newsmen that "in fairness to Sen.
Saxbe," President Nixon should find someone else to head
the Justice Department.
After presiding over a Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing on a bill designed to hurdle a Constitutional
barrier to Saxbe's nomination, Byrd said the
administration should have explored the question of
Saxbe's eligibility before selecting him.
Saxbe was a member of the Senate in 1969 when the
attorney general's annual salary and that of other cabinet
members was increased from $35,000 to $60,000.
Under the Constitution, no member of Congress shall,
during the term for which he was elected, be appointed to
a federal office for which the salary has been increased
during that time.
The issue is not whether this bars Saxbe from
appointment until after his Senate term expires on Jan. 3,
1975, but whether an administration-proposed bill to roll
back the attorney general's salary to $35,000 would make
him eligible.
The Justice Department says the bill complies with the
Constitutional purpose because Saxbe would not benefit
from the 1969 salary increase.
Prof. William Van Alstyne, associate dean of the Duke
University Law School, supported this view.
But Profs. Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago
Law School, William Swindler of the William and Mary
College of Law and Dean Willard Lorensen of the West
Virginia University Law School disagreed.
They argued that the Constitutional prohibition is clear

official — were taken to the stadium for questioning, then
released or taken to jails.
The number jailed was undisclosed.
The arrests appeared to indicate students won at least
some support from workers in their bid last week to
topple the army-backed regime led by President George
Papadopoulos.
Troops and tanks patrolled in Greece's three largest
cities — Athens, Salonica and Patras — enforcing the
martial law declared Saturday after bloody clashes

Oil Companies Held In Contempt
SACRAMENTO — Texaco and Mobil oil companies
were held in contempt of the legislature yesterday for
•refusing to release data on crude oil pricing.
A joint subcommittee investigating oil leases on the
state-owned lands voted the contempt order after a Los
Angeles court rejected the companies' attempt to quash
the subcommittee's subpoenas.
A third oil company, Exxon, asked the subcommittee
for a delay to give it more time to decide whether it
would provide the subpoenaed data.
Subcommittee chairman Kenneth Cory said the firms
were buying oil through leases with the state at
below-market prices. He said the purpose of the
subpoenas was to determine whether state law should be
changed to give California more favorable oil lease
contracts.

Saxbe's Eligibility Questioned
WASHINGTON — Three of four law school professors
testifying before a Senate committee said yesterday Sen.
William B. Saxbe, R-Ohio, cannot be made
constitutionally eligible, with the aid of a special bill, for
appointment as attorney general.
The assistant majority leader, Sen. Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia, told newsmen that "in fairness to Sen.
Saxbe," President Nixon should find someone else to head
the Justice Department.
After presiding over a Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing on a bill designed to hurdle a Constitutional
barrier to Saxbe's nomination, Byrd said the
administration should have explored the question of
Saxbe's eligibility before selecting him.
Saxbe was a member of the Senate in 1969 when the
attorney general's annual salary and that of other cabinet
members was increased from $35,000 to $60,000.
Under the Constitution, no member of Congress shall,
during the term for which he was elected, be appointed to
a federal office for which the salary has been increased
during that time.
The issue is not whether this bars Saxbe from
appointment until after his Senate term expires on Jan. 3,
1975, but whether an administration-proposed bill to roll
back the attorney general's salary to $35,000 would make
him eligible.
The Justice Department says the bill complies with the
Constitutional purpose because Saxbe would not benefit
from the 1969 salary increase.
Prof. William Van Alstyne, associate dean of the Duke
University Law School, supported this view.
But Profs. Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago
Law School, William Swindler of the William and Mary
College of Law and Dean Willard Lorensen of the West
Virginia University Law School disagreed.
They argued that the Constitutional prohibition is clear
and explicit and that Saxbe's disqualification cannot be
overcome by the special legislation.
Court Rejeets Reagan Welfare Plan
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's attempt to
implement a new federal welfare program for the aged,
disabled and blind without legislation was rejected by a
state appeals court yesterday.
The court said the administration would have to
continue full payments to the 500,000 recipients on its
own, pending passage of legislation.
This could cost the state an estimated $200 million
more a year in maintaining the program, some welfare
experts estimated. Welfare Director David Swoap said his
attorneys were trying to determine if that was true.
"We will have to continue with state-county
administration after Jan. 1, and it means that the grant
levels will be at least what they were in December,"
Swoap said.
But there's a chance the court order would raise

welfare payments even above the level proposed in
Democratic-sponsored legislation which the Republican
governor rejected last September.
For example, aid to the blind would have gone from an
average of $212 per month to $237 under the Reagan
plan. It would have gone to $250 under the Democratic
proposal but would be $252 under the court order.
The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled the Reagan
administration did not have the legal authority to put the
program into effect without legislation.
Eleven Die In Greek Riot
ATHENS — Soliders and troops rounded up scores of
youths and workers in a soccer stadium yesterday
following student-led riots that left 11 persons dead and
at least 148 persons injured.
Those apprehended — half of them construction
workers and local union leaders, according to one high
official — were taken to the stadium for questioning, then
released or taken to jails.
The number jailed was undisclosed.
