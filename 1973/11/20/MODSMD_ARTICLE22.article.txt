# New Research Grant
## AID Funds Media Study 
### 
An institutional grant of
$1,000,000 to strengthen the
international communication research
and teaching program in the
Department of Communication was
announced yesterday by the
University.
To be made available over a
five-year period, the grant from the
U.S. Agency for International
Development will permit Stanford's
Institute for Communication Research
to strengthen its competence in
"communication as related to
education and human resource
development in less developed
countries." It becomes effective with
the current academic year.

Under the grant, Stanford will
improve its own programs in the field,
will work closely with research
organizations in developing countries
on problems of mutual interest, and
will add several new activities designed
to increase the number and improve
the quality of persons with
competency in the international
communication research field. The
project will be directed by Prof. Lyle
Nelson, department chairman.
Stanford plans to initiate a special
master's degree program for a limited
number of students from developing
countries who have research or
administrative responsibilities in
projects using the mass media or other

communication technologies.
The grant also provides support for
several Stanford Ph.D. students who
are preparing for careers in the
international development
communication field.
The Institute for Communication
Research, part of the department, has
had close ties with comparable
research organizations in several
foreign countries. Under the grant,
cooperative research and training
activities will be extended.
Much of the Institute's work in the
past entailed evaluations of
instructional television projects in such
countries as Colombia, El Salvador,
the Ivory Coast, Mexico, and Samoa.
Although evaluative research will
remain a major focus of the Institute
under the grant, the scope of such
work will be broadened to include
studies of the social, political, and
economic consequences of
communication as well.
Future field work will concentrate
more on the applications of smaller,
lower cost technologies to meet the
information and educational needs of
rural, out-of-school populations.
Part of the program will involve
bringing in specialists from other
disciplines for the purpose of designing
a comprehensive approach to the
study of communication needs and
problems in developing countries. To
make certain that results of research
findings in one country are made
available to policy makers and
planners in others, Stanford will also
take steps to improve the
dissemination of this information.
