# European Ski Trails Please Students Here

### SANDY WHITE 
To schuss the slopes at Zermatt,
to master the moguls of Grenoble,
to traverse the very ridges of the
Alps — these are dreams of
everyone who has ever
snowplowed down a bunny slope
and felt that first tinge of
excitement which comes from
skiing. Europe has long been the
home of skiing as a serious sport,
and its slopes remain legendary
Meccas to many.
Fortunately for frugal Stanford
students, they needn't fly to
Switzerland to ski good slopes.
But those who do have the
opportunity to ski in Europe
bring back tales of postcard
villages and spectacular trails.
Two students who have skied
both European and American —
especially Californian — slopes,
compared the areas. Bill Scott,
who was in Switzerland two years
ago, likened Zermatt to Colorado
ski areas. Instead of skiing in a
forest as in California, he prefers
the big, higher areas where one
has greater freedom to travel, he
explained.
Alan Bush found the Austrian
town of Zurs am Alberg "prettier
than anything you'd find in
America,"and enjoyed the great
variety of trails and conditions
there.
Scott skied basically two
places: Crans-Montana, a
"high-powered resort," and a
small Swiss village. While
Crans-Montana draws
sophisticated Europeans by the
thousands, the village was small
and friendly.
'Best In The World'
Bush stayed in Zurs, and also
skied from the nearby town of
Lech. "That whole area is
considered one of the best in the
world and is very popular with
Europeans," he said.
Expenses in Europe are
generally lower than in California,
the two agreed. Bush estimated
equipment rental costs were less
than two-thirds local prices, and
explained that at Zurs there is no
set lift fee but, instead, a ticket
book. Different lifts take a
different number of tickets, so
one pays for how much one skies.
Accommodations range from
inexpensive to luxurious — all

under American prices.
Of course, getting to Europe
poses an overwhelming expense.
However, Bush said he would have
saved enough money skiing over
there for three weeks, compared
to what he would spend skiing for
the same length of time here, to
pay for his plane fare.
Drier Snow
In Switzerland, Scott said that
the snow is drier than in
California, but not as powdery as
in Colorado. Bush, who skied at
Zurs last December, said he'd
expected powder, but found slopes
icier than usual. He also noticed a
difference in the conditions of the
European slopes compared to
California's.
American slopes, he said, are
maintained more fastidiously,
with snow-making, snow-grinding,
and snow-blowing machines to
keep them fresh and smooth. Bill
agreed, remarking that such
careful grooming "Takes all the
fun out of it."
In Europe, as Bush said, "you
have to ski it the way it comes."
This leads to great variety on the
slopes, which may combine any or
all of these conditions: ice,
powder, moguls, trees, snow
banks, cliffs, wide trails, or
narrow chutes.
Famous For Skills
European ski instructors are
famous for their skills, and Bush
discovered why. There are 10
levels of classes, and in the third
one, students learn parallel skiing.
After that, instructors teach other
tricks and skills, such as how to
get down one of the expert slopes.
In Europe, Scott said that
when they say "watch out," they
mean it. Bush described the most
advanced lessons: "That's where
they learn how to do somersaults
off a cliff." He has taken lessons
at Heavenly Valley in California
too, but found them
disappointing by comparison. The
quality of instruction was fair, but
since the slopes were not as
challenging, there was less need
for instruction.
At the resorts, the
conventional methods of ascent
are T-bar, rope tow, chair lift, and
cable car. But there are more
unconventional means for the
thrill-seeker. One can fly to the

top of a glacier, as Scott did,
parachute out with his skis, and
ski down the mountain. Or the
cross-country enthusiast can climb
the mountain with
sealskin-treaded skis, then wind
over the ridges and ski back down.
Greater Dangers
European skiing has greater
dangers, but California skiing has
greater crowds and less variety.
Scott rated California skiing very
highly, and said that he would not
travel to Europe to ski when
Colorado slopes are as good or
better.
With tuition going up again,
Stanford students may not be able
to flock to the Alps in droves, or
even trickles. But those who can
go, will find an exciting
atmosphere and new slopes, and
no McDonalds'.
