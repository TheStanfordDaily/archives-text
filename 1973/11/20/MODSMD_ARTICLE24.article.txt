# Conservationists Concerned
## Skiers Choke Resorts 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Thousands of city people will choke the
mountains this winter searching for weekend fun. In
their enthusiastic rush to enjoy the snowy
wilderness, they will corrupt it with their gasoline
fumes, noise and garbage, conservationists charge.
The outcome of such an onslaught of fun seekers
will be the urbanization of our wilderness. That is
the opinion of the assistant director of conservation
Charles Clusen, at the Sierra Club national
headquarters in San Francisco.
"It's not the actual skiing which is so harmful,"
he explained. "The impact on the environment of
skis passing over the ground is rather minimal.
However, the concentration of people and
associated factors are very destructive."
"The amount of acreage covered with facilities is
relatively small," he conceded. "The worst part is
that these facilities and services break up the
wilderness."
For example, roads and highways often cut
through remote areas to make ski slopes accessible.
These ribbons through the mountains carry
pollution into the wilderness. The streams, then,
distribute it throughout otherwise untouched areas,
Clusen said.
Vicious Intruder
The snowmobile, he charged, is the most vicious
intruder into remote areas. The inroads it can cut
are limitless and threatening. They pose a potential
danger to the wildlife in winter animal preserves.
"There have been instances where people have
chased down the wildlife in snowmobiles," Clusen
said. More often, the animals are inadvertantly
frightened.
The presence of man in the mountains is enough
to make some species like the grizzly bear simply
desert to more remote areas like Montana, Clusen
said. For others, man's presence affects their
reproductive behavior.
Winter Mobs
The same winter mobs who drive the wildlife
away from their natural habitats attract business
and services like magnets. Small towns, which are

not equipped to cope with the spontaneous flood of
weekend fun seekers, are soon commercialized and
filled with restaurants, hotels and a roaring night life
to entertain skiers.
However, the expansion of these small towns is
not generally accompanied by fundamental
renovations. Backwood roads and inadequate
sewage systems, for example, remain in spite of
large scale growth.
"Obviously, some of these towns don't have
adequate sewage systems. You know it's all going
somewhere, creating damage somewhere — often
into streams and eventually into lakes and rivers."
Bigger Tanks
The larger the septic tank, the bigger the
problem, Clusen contends. Big tanks are especially
hard to care for.
Although cabin owners are not as big
contributors to sewage pollution, Clusen contends
that the cabin craze has other drawbacks. "A great
number of cabins can create an urban sprawl just
like a strip development on the edge of an urban
area. It can be just as trashy," he said.
With more cabins, hotels, restaurants, nightclubs,
and resorts constructed in the wilderness, there is a
greater drain on the nation's energy resources. "All
these places require a lot of heating and electricity,"
Clusen said.
Stopping Build-Up
He advocated stopping the build-up of the Lake
Tahoe region until adequate controls are adopted.
"Lake Tahoe is a unique national resource worth
trying to save," he said.
Although Clusen is dubious of contractors try ing
to save the environment they are developing, several
ski resorts claim they are taking steps in the right
direction. For example, the policy statement and
brochure of the recently opened Northstar ski area
in the Tahoe area reads: "Hills, streams and trees
left virtually untouched. In planning Northstar,
every effort has been made to assure that we do not
violate the landscape, but rather work with it to
form a harmonious relationship between man and
environment."

he explained. "The impact on the environment of
skis passing over the ground is rather minimal.
However, the concentration of people and
associated factors are very destructive."
"The amount of acreage covered with facilities is
relatively small," he conceded. "The worst part is
that these facilities and services break up the
wilderness."
For example, roads and highways often cut
through remote areas to make ski slopes accessible.
These ribbons through the mountains carry
pollution into the wilderness. The streams, then,
distribute it throughout otherwise untouched areas,
Clusen said.
Vicious Intruder
The snowmobile, he charged, is the most vicious
intruder into remote areas. The inroads it can cut
are limitless and threatening. They pose a potential
danger to the wildlife in winter animal preserves.
"There have been instances where people have
chased down the wildlife in snowmobiles," Clusen
said. More often, the animals are inadvertantly
frightened.
The presence of man in the mountains is enough
to make some species like the grizzly bear simply
desert to more remote areas like Montana, Clusen
said. For others, man's presence affects their
reproductive behavior.
Winter Mobs
The same winter mobs who drive the wildlife
away from their natural habitats attract business
and services like magnets. Small towns, which are

not equipped to cope with the spontaneous flood of
weekend fun seekers, are soon commercialized and
filled with restaurants, hotels and a roaring night life
to entertain skiers.
However, the expansion of these small towns is
not generally accompanied by fundamental
renovations. Backwood roads and inadequate
sewage systems, for example, remain in spite of
large scale growth.
"Obviously, some of these towns don't have
adequate sewage systems. You know it's all going
somewhere, creating damage somewhere — often
into streams and eventually into lakes and rivers."
Bigger Tanks
The larger the septic tank, the bigger the
problem, Clusen contends. Big tanks are especially
hard to care for.
Although cabin owners are not as big
contributors to sewage pollution, Clusen contends
that the cabin craze has other drawbacks. "A great
number of cabins can create an urban sprawl just
like a strip development on the edge of an urban
area. It can be just as trashy," he said.
With more cabins, hotels, restaurants, nightclubs,
and resorts constructed in the wilderness, there is a
greater drain on the nation's energy resources. "All
these places require a lot of heating and electricity,"
Clusen said.
Stopping Build-Up
He advocated stopping the build-up of the Lake
Tahoe region until adequate controls are adopted.
"Lake Tahoe is a unique national resource worth
trying to save," he said.
Although Clusen is dubious of contractors try ing
to save the environment they are developing, several
ski resorts claim they are taking steps in the right
direction. For example, the policy statement and
brochure of the recently opened Northstar ski area
in the Tahoe area reads: "Hills, streams and trees
left virtually untouched. In planning Northstar,
every effort has been made to assure that we do not
violate the landscape, but rather work with it to
form a harmonious relationship between man and
environment."
Thousands of city people will choke the
mountains this winter searching for weekend fun. In
their enthusiastic rush to enjoy the snowy
wilderness, they will corrupt it with their gasoline
fumes, noise and garbage, conservationists charge.
The outcome of such an onslaught of fun seekers
will be the urbanization of our wilderness. That is
the opinion of the assistant director of conservation
Charles Clusen, at the Sierra Club national
headquarters in San Francisco.
"It's not the actual skiing which is so harmful,"
he explained. "The impact on the environment of
skis passing over the ground is rather minimal.
However, the concentration of people and
associated factors are very destructive."
