# Cross Country Tours Offer Increased Ease, Freedom
## 
### ANDREW BRIDGES 
Apart from requiring snow and
skis, cross-country ski touring and
downhill skiing are two
completely different sports.
Ski touring (cross-country, or
Nordic skiing) generally attracts a
different type of person than the
faster downhill sport. The
downhill skier hits the slopes with
fancy, expensive equipment,
stylish garb, and money for the
lift ticket. He waits in line for up
to half an hour to ride the lift up
to the top of the slope. He skis
down, waits in line again for the
ride to the top, and he skis again.
The cross-country skier takes
off from any convenient spot — a
camping area, a roadside, or even
a downhill ski area He skis
wherever he desires — down hills,
around hills, and up hills. Using
thin wooden skis, he dresses in
whatever is comfortable and
carries anything he needs on his
back.
Away from roads and cars and
people, he may ski a few minutes,
or carrying a tent and other
equipment, a few days. No lift
tickets, no lines, no crowds.
Nordic ski touring offers much
of the thrill of downhill skiing
along with the beauty and peace
of uncrowded, snow-swept fields,
valleys, and mountains.
The cross-country skier enjoys
traveling through the wilderness
and does not need to leave his
mark upon it. The downhiller
requires ski runs cleared of all
trees — denuded hillsides laced
with machinery and cables.
The equipment used for ski
touring is very different from
downhill ski gear. Touring skis are
wooden, lightweight, and thin. To
provide necessary control, special
waxes must be applied to the

running surfaces for the skis to
slide smoothly yet to grip when
one strides.
Nordic ski bindings secure only
the toes of the ski boots to the
skis, leaving the skier's heels free
to move so that he may stride
property. There are two main
types of bindings — pin and cable.
The cable binding is useful for
more rugged mountaineering
work; the pin type is used more
often for light touring.
One advantage of cross-country
equipment over downhill gear is
the price. A complete set of
top-quality cross country ski
equipment costs about $65. For
those who do not wish to invest in
ski gear, many shops carry rental
equipment. Rentals near the
popular ski areas are generally
expensive; rent your gear around
here, instead, and take it with
you.
Rental equipment at
most big mountaineering shops is
generally of top quality and the
advice is good. Beware, however,
of smaller shops which have their
cross-country business as a
sideline and where the employees
know less about the sport.
Skiing cross-country involves
skiing uphill as well as down. To
glide uphill, special waxes are
needed. These waxes are designed
to allow skis to slide once moving,
but to grip when stopped. With
properly waxed skis, striding up
hills is usually no problem.
Waxing is an art; a bad waxing
job can turn an intensely
pleasurable tour into a wretched
affair. Different waxes are
designed for different weather
conditions. Hard waxes, which
come in tins, are for colder
temperatures and more powdery
snow; klister waxes, which

resemble a combination of honey
and chewing gum packaged in a
toothpaste-type tube, suit warmer
temperatures and more icy snow.
The waxes are color coded; in the
hard waxes, green and blue work
best in colder weather, red and
yellow in warmer.
Cross-country is not hiking on
skis. The proper motion is not one
of walking but of gliding with
long, smooth strides. The stride is
somewhat similar to the motion
needed to slide across a floor
wearing bedroom slippers ten sizes
too large. The waxes enable the
skier to glide uphill; however, it is
sometimes necessary to
herringbone or sidestep up steep
slopes. Going downhill, one may
stride or coast.
The basic turn in Nordic skiing
is the step- or kick-turn. To
accomplish this, one simply lifts
one ski and points it in the
direction he wishes to go. He
plants that ski and turns the other
ski similarly.
Ski touring is not in itself as
hazardous as downhill skiing.
There are fewer broken bones and
skis because the action is slower
and more easy-going. The major
danger comes from being
unprotected from natural forces
and avalanches. All ski tourers
should learn about avalanche
dangers and should be prepared
for sudden severe changes in
weather.
Several groups in the
local area sponsor cross-country
ski trips. On campus, the
Stanford Conservation Group
plans outings. The Loma Prieta
Chapter of the Sierra Club,
located on Emerson Street in Palo
Alto, has a ski touring section
which will take several trips this
season.
