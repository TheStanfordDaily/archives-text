# Card Ski Team Expects Improvement
## 
### NANCY DITZ 
Reports of snow in the Sierras
are exciting the members of
Stanford's ski team, who have
been preparing for the upcoming
season since September.
The men's ski team expects to
register an improved performance
over last year. One of last year's
best skiers David Horth is
returning fully recovered from a
dislocated shoulder. Horth and
team captain David Andrews
attended summer racing camp in
Montana where they were
coached by World Cup winner
Billy Kidd.

Coach Skip Stritter is
especially hopeful of freshmen
Philip Barnes and Tom Hutton.
"We have a lot of really good new
talent that hasn't skied for
Stanford before," he said.
Sophomore captain Kathy
Frankland will lead the women's
team this season, joined by
returning racers Lynn Littlefield,
Kathy Reynolds and freshman
Lori Gibson.
Frankland anticipates a better
upcoming season than last year's.
"Last year we used the courses
and officials after the boys had
finished. We were skiing in ruts up
to our knees, and nobody finished
a slalom without falling.
"This year we'll have our own
courses and officials. There will
even be a women's downhill at the
Pacific Coast Championships."
Last year, the women's team
consistently finished fourth, fifth,
and sixth, individually.
Actual on-the-snow training
will begin Nov. 22 with a
Thanksgiving clinic for both the
alpine (downhill) and nordic
(cross country) teams.
Competition begins Dec. 8 with
the Siskiyous Race at Mt. Shasta.
The goal this year, according to
coach Skip Stritter, is to beat the
University of Nevada at Reno and
hopefully qualify for the NCAAs.
The nordic men's and women's

teams hope to be much stronger
this season. Since the nordic and
alpine points are combined for the
overall team points, pressure is
being put on the nordic teams to
finish stronger than they did last
year.
The women's nordic team has
three new members. All the cross
country skiers have been working
out together, especially on
endurance building.
The men's jumping team is
composed mostly of alpine skiers.
All of last year's jumpers are
returning except Mike Iker who
will coach this season. There are

four new cross country runners
this year, hoping to improve
Stanford's previously poor finish
in this event.
This year the NCAAs are
sanctioning Far West Ski
Association (FWSA) races,
allowing college skiers to race in
FWSA races to earn international
points. Stritter and Iker are
encouraging members to enter
FWSA races and will be racing
themselves.
The ski team likes to encourage
non-racers to join its program.

Stritter said "there are lots of
examples last year of people who
had never raced getting to race
with us."
Frankland said, "The main goal
and attribute of the team is fun.
You go out and work hard but
have a good time. It's a different
aspect of skiing."
Andrews sees a different goal
for the team. "I think we should
beat Nevada in some races. If we
beat them at the Championships,
we'll qualify for the NCAAs.
That's our goal."
