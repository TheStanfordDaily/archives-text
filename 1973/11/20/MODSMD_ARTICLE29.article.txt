# Ski Equipment Buying Requires Great Caution
## 
### DAVID ANDREWS 
If you are acquisitive,
frivolous, wealthy, or fetishistic,
you probably like to ski. When
you're buying equipment you'd
better be cautious and critical,
too.
The Consumer's Guide or Ski
Magazine offers only limited
advice; basically, it's the
consumer's responsibility to
challenge the management to
make them prove that their
product will, indeed, live up to its
guarantee.
The first rule is to make the
assumption that every article has
some deficiency.
If the consumer discovers the
flaw — and no ski product is a
Dresden piece by any means — he
has two options: the cautious may
want to point it out and ask to see
something better. The crafty may
check the length of the guarantee,
ski like mad until two weeks
before its expiration, then return
the product, pointing out its
original flaw.
Getting down to specifics, the
buyer must scrutinize especially
the ski. More than any other piece
of skiing equipment, the ski varies

immensely from brand to brand.
The second rule: Realize who
you are and how you ski. If you
race, you must be painfully aware
of your limitations and should
choose your skis accordingly.
Meticulous Skiing
The Marine Corps sergeant
gives his private's rifle a rigorous
inspection, and for good reason.
That rifle represents the private's
life on the battle field. The buyer,
too, must inspect his skis
rigorously because he depends
upon them for his life on the
slopes.
Grab a pair of skis from the
stock and separate them. Take
one and toss it about rather
gruffly to check its durability.
Notice that most skis are built
with a concave bend called
"camber" which compensates for
the skier's weight and causes the
shovel and tail of the ski to track
more effectively.
Bend back the ski just enough
to flatten the camber and look
down along the bottom from the
shovel end. You look like you are
going to make love to the ski, but
from this position you can notice
any warps or irregularities in the

P-tex and edges.
Now reunite your skis bottom
to bottom. Due to the arched
camber they should be touching
only at tail and tip. Face the skis
with the edges towards you. Lift
them where they touch each other
at the tip and let them dangle
vertically above the ground.
If they are property matched,
they will align with each other's
edges without the least bit of
deviation. If not, you have chosen
a poorly matched pair of skis.
You shouldn't tolerate any flaw
because it will magnify itself as
the season progresses.
Existential Pain
Selecting boots can cause great
existential pain because they offer
so many choices. First the
consumer should decide whether
he wants to try the new foam or
flow boots, or whether he wants
to stick with the more
conservative leather boots.
Lace-ups are nearly antiques these
days.
Both foam and flow offer
maximum comfort, but for
different lengths of time. Flow
reacts quickly to temperature
changes by remolding its shape.
This can be disadvantageous in
hot weather, because you may
slosh around in your boots. Foam,
on the other hand, maintains a
static conformation to fit your
foot, but tends to break down
after prolonged use.
One brand of foam — Dayla —
breaks down more slowly than
other brands because of an
ingenious principle. The resiliency
in most foam is due to tiny air
pockets in a rubber-like substance.
Dayla foam is a latex rubber
substance which has tiny
styrofoam balls instead of air
pockets. As a result, Dayla foam
remains resilient longer.
Choosing poles is less
complicated than selecting boots.
Grasp them upside down between
the basket and the point. The
correct pole will hang
perpendicular to your extended
arm and touch the floor.

product will, indeed, live up to its
guarantee.
The first rule is to make the
assumption that every article has
some deficiency.
If the consumer discovers the
flaw — and no ski product is a
Dresden piece by any means — he
has two options: the cautious may
want to point it out and ask to see
something better. The crafty may
check the length of the guarantee,
ski like mad until two weeks
before its expiration, then return
the product, pointing out its
original flaw.
Getting down to specifics, the
buyer must scrutinize especially
the ski. More than any other piece
of skiing equipment, the ski varies

immensely from brand to brand.
The second rule: Realize who
you are and how you ski. If you
race, you must be painfully aware
of your limitations and should
choose your skis accordingly.
Meticulous Skiing
The Marine Corps sergeant
gives his private's rifle a rigorous
inspection, and for good reason.
That rifle represents the private's
life on the battle field. The buyer,
too, must inspect his skis
rigorously because he depends
upon them for his life on the
slopes.
Grab a pair of skis from the
stock and separate them. Take
one and toss it about rather
gruffly to check its durability.
Notice that most skis are built
with a concave bend called
"camber" which compensates for
the skier's weight and causes the
shovel and tail of the ski to track
more effectively.
Bend back the ski just enough
to flatten the camber and look
down along the bottom from the
shovel end. You look like you are
going to make love to the ski, but
from this position you can notice
any warps or irregularities in the

P-tex and edges.
Now reunite your skis bottom
to bottom. Due to the arched
camber they should be touching
only at tail and tip. Face the skis
with the edges towards you. Lift
them where they touch each other
at the tip and let them dangle
vertically above the ground.
If they are property matched,
they will align with each other's
edges without the least bit of
deviation. If not, you have chosen
a poorly matched pair of skis.
You shouldn't tolerate any flaw
because it will magnify itself as
the season progresses.
Existential Pain
Selecting boots can cause great
existential pain because they offer
so many choices. First the
consumer should decide whether
he wants to try the new foam or
flow boots, or whether he wants
to stick with the more
conservative leather boots.
Lace-ups are nearly antiques these
days.
Both foam and flow offer
maximum comfort, but for
different lengths of time. Flow
reacts quickly to temperature
changes by remolding its shape.
This can be disadvantageous in
hot weather, because you may
slosh around in your boots. Foam,
on the other hand, maintains a
static conformation to fit your
foot, but tends to break down
after prolonged use.
One brand of foam — Dayla —
breaks down more slowly than
other brands because of an
ingenious principle. The resiliency
in most foam is due to tiny air
pockets in a rubber-like substance.
Dayla foam is a latex rubber
substance which has tiny
styrofoam balls instead of air
pockets. As a result, Dayla foam
remains resilient longer.
Choosing poles is less
complicated than selecting boots.
Grasp them upside down between
the basket and the point. The
correct pole will hang
perpendicular to your extended
arm and touch the floor.

captain on the Stanford ski team.)
If you are acquisitive,
frivolous, wealthy, or fetishistic,
you probably like to ski. When
you're buying equipment you'd
better be cautious and critical,
too.
The Consumer's Guide or Ski
Magazine offers only limited
advice; basically, it's the
consumer's responsibility to
challenge the management to
make them prove that their
