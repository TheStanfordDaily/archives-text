# Cal Students Pull Pranks On Campus

### GLENN GARVIN 
Big Game Week officially opened
yesterday with Berkeley students
pulling off the first pranks, but it
looks like the biggest stunt of all — the
bonfire — has died a quiet death.
The Inter-Fraternity Council, which
normally does most of the work on
the annual bonfire, decided the
Thanksgiving holiday would diminish
student interest in the project.
"They thought that people would
really have to get started working on
Thursday, which is Thanksgiving," said
Melinda Howe of University Relations,
who coordinated last year's aborted
bonfire.
Last year the event was cancelled
when torrential rains flooded Lake
Lagunita, where the bonfire is
normally held. Last week's rains left
several feet of water in the lakebed,
but Howe said that there would have
been no fire anyway.
"I was hoping there would be a
bonfire this year, but it's really got to
be a student project," she said.
"Thanksgiving just messed things up
too much."
No one is planning any pep rally for
Friday night to replace the bonfire,
although the Band will march around
campus. They'll cap the evening with a
concert in San Francisco's Ghirardelli
Square.
Although Stanford isn't planning
much in the way of Big Game activity,
Berkeley apparently is. About 500
copies of yesterday's Daily were
stamped "Beat Stanford Blue And
Gold" in blue ink, and newspaper
officials indicated that they didn't do
it.
"Obviously the Cal hooligans
escaped from their cages last night,"
one senior staffer explained.
Two members of Stanford's SAE
fraternity planted a banner reading
"Beet Cal" on the roof of the Hoover
Tower lobby after an unsuccessful
attempt to scale the tower rarly
Monday morning.
"They were ex-mountain climbers,
and they just thought it might be a
good idea," a fraternity spokesman
told the Daily last night.
