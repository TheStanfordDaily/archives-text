# Skiers Occupy Old Sierran Town
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Somewhere northwest of Lake
Tahoe, hidden from the dozen
thriving ski areas which rapidly fill
up that vicinity each winter, the
sleepy little town of Truckee
edges toward discovery.
The rugged railroad-lumber
town steeped in Sierran frontier
memories cannot remain a secret
much longer because of its
locational value to the skiing
population.
Thirty days ago Amtrak began
making two scheduled stops a day
in Truckee — a definitive move in
channeling West Coast skiers
through the 125-year-old town.
With fuel rationing imminent and
special train rates for skiers likely,
the railroad seems the logical
alternative for never-say-die
downhillers.
Subsequent development of
hotels, restaurants and stores
catering to this "tracks are back"
crowd endangers the rusty sign on
the outskirts of Truckee which
has listed its population at 1000
for almost two decades.
Despite some private
condominium development
prompted by the 1960 Olympics
at Squaw Valley just 15 minutes
away, and the completion of
Highway 80 connecting the town
with San Francisco, Truckee
remained isolated until recently.
Perhaps its harsh environment has
kept all but the hardiest away
until now. Biting cold winds
whistling through bleak
snow-covered mountains make its
surrounding environment spooky
if pot downright hostile in winter.
Donner Party Fate
One cannot hglp but recall the
fate of the Donner Party in 1847
when 22 feet of snow trapped 87
Pacific-bound settlers in this area

for an entire winter. Almost half
starved or froze to death, and
human flesh became part of the
regular diet. Years later, 22-foot
tree stumps provide grim evidence
of the snow level at which the
shivering pioneers chopped down
trees.
Truckee's retired constable and
fire chief, 65-year-old Tom
Dolley, enjoys recalling
particularly bad winters there
since he arrived in 1930. "In
1938, we had 12 feet of snow.
And in those days when it
snowed, everything stopped. The
only way to get around was to
wear snowshoes and pull a
handsled."
Dolley recalls so much snow
some years that houses would
burn to the ground before anyone
could find the fire hydrants under
all the snow. "The first alarm I
ever answered as fire chief was my
own house," Dolley laughs. "It
burned clear to the ground. We
saved the lot, though," he quips.
Town Is Changing
Despite the fact that Truckee's
one main street appears as it
always did, the town is changing.
The long row of boxy two-story
buildings has grudgingly replaced
most of the bars and bawdy
houses frequented by
muddy-booted, bearded woodsmen
and railroad maintenance men,
with more conservative
cafe-restaurants and inexpensive
hotels. A hardware store has taken
over where the blacksmith left
off, and the town jail is
antiquated.
The old Capitol Theatre, the
town's first brick building which
once saved many adjacent wooden
structures from a devastating fire
by resisting the spreading flames,
now houses an informal

restaurant. Its marquee advertises
chicken dinner bargains instead of
an opera company from Virginia
City which used to provide some
culture for the few refined enough
to appreciate it.
The railroad still rumbles
through town. But now the trains
deliver supplies for Truckee's
tourist business rather than pick
up the lumber and the ice, which
was pulled by horses from the
frozen Truckee River to be
packed in sawdust and hurried by
train to cities as far away as
Chicago.
Main Supply Route
Truckee remains on one of the
main trans-Sierra supply routes.
Thus trains 100 cars long
burdened with refrigerators,
canned foods, and Detroit
automobiles strain their way up
snowy mountain passes into
Truckee. Surrealistically, these
puffing iron contraptions loaded
down with mass-produced
hardware disappear again beyond
Truckee into dark, frigid and
unpredictable mountains
untouched by man; products of
industrialization travel over, and
yet do not interact with nor harm
the surrounding unspoiled
physical environment.
But while the train passes over
the mountains, it stops in
Truckee, supplying the increasing
number of tourists. The, tgjvn
faces overcrowding, and appears
to have little chance of stopping
the inevitable commercialism and
urbanization.
Dale Strickland, who manages
the new Bank of America branch
in town and heads the Truckee
Chamber of Commerce, observes
that "people are going to come no
matter what." So he advocates
trying to control those who do

move in rather than fighting such
emigration.
Traffic Phase-Out
Strickland calls for the phasing
out of most tourist auto traffic in
Truckee through increased travel
by railroad. He laments the traffic
congestion on Interstate 80 near
Truckee on Sunday afternoons
during ski season, particularly
during a snowstorm. "After all,"
he says, "I'd rather see them come
in by train than by car."
But Strickland cites the
necessity for a public
transportation system to take
skiers from town to the
neighboring ski areas. "As we have
no funds for such a system, there
must be a federal subsidy. That
will only come after an outcry by
residents."
However, Truckee lacks the
lobbying power to secure such
funds at this point. The Chamber
of Commerce, a possible

influence, relies on voluntary
participation and donations by
residents, and is often inactive.
Most who come to the meetings
are businessmen who do not place
such a system as their top
priority.
Strickland also stresses strict
land use management on the part
of the Nevada County Board of
Supervisors, who authorize
building. "We've learned from the
Tahoe Basin," where less stringent
zoning laws have resulted in
unaesthetic building, he
comments. He points to the
''carefully planned"
Tahoe -Donner condominium
development underway not far
from Truckee's old main street.
But again, the problem of
voluntary control in sale of
private real estate creates a
skeptical outlook for the
preservation of Truckee's natural
beauty.

Subsequent development of
hotels, restaurants and stores
catering to this "tracks are back"
crowd endangers the rusty sign on
the outskirts of Truckee which
has listed its population at 1000
for almost two decades.
Despite some private
condominium development
prompted by the 1960 Olympics
at Squaw Valley just 15 minutes
away, and the completion of
Highway 80 connecting the town
with San Francisco, Truckee
remained isolated until recently.
Perhaps its harsh environment has
kept all but the hardiest away
until now. Biting cold winds
whistling through bleak
snow-covered mountains make its
surrounding environment spooky
if pot downright hostile in winter.
Donner Party Fate
One cannot hglp but recall the
fate of the Donner Party in 1847
when 22 feet of snow trapped 87
Pacific-bound settlers in this area

for an entire winter. Almost half
starved or froze to death, and
human flesh became part of the
regular diet. Years later, 22-foot
tree stumps provide grim evidence
of the snow level at which the
shivering pioneers chopped down
trees.
Truckee's retired constable and
fire chief, 65-year-old Tom
Dolley, enjoys recalling
particularly bad winters there
since he arrived in 1930. "In
1938, we had 12 feet of snow.
And in those days when it
snowed, everything stopped. The
only way to get around was to
wear snowshoes and pull a
handsled."
Dolley recalls so much snow
some years that houses would
burn to the ground before anyone
could find the fire hydrants under
all the snow. "The first alarm I
ever answered as fire chief was my
own house," Dolley laughs. "It
burned clear to the ground. We
saved the lot, though," he quips.
Town Is Changing
Despite the fact that Truckee's
one main street appears as it
always did, the town is changing.
The long row of boxy two-story
buildings has grudgingly replaced
most of the bars and bawdy
houses frequented by
muddy-booted, bearded woodsmen
and railroad maintenance men,
with more conservative
cafe-restaurants and inexpensive
hotels. A hardware store has taken
over where the blacksmith left
off, and the town jail is
antiquated.
The old Capitol Theatre, the
town's first brick building which
once saved many adjacent wooden
structures from a devastating fire
by resisting the spreading flames,
now houses an informal

restaurant. Its marquee advertises
chicken dinner bargains instead of
an opera company from Virginia
City which used to provide some
culture for the few refined enough
to appreciate it.
The railroad still rumbles
through town. But now the trains
deliver supplies for Truckee's
tourist business rather than pick
up the lumber and the ice, which
was pulled by horses from the
frozen Truckee River to be
packed in sawdust and hurried by
train to cities as far away as
Chicago.
Main Supply Route
Truckee remains on one of the
main trans-Sierra supply routes.
Thus trains 100 cars long
burdened with refrigerators,
canned foods, and Detroit
automobiles strain their way up
snowy mountain passes into
Truckee. Surrealistically, these
puffing iron contraptions loaded
down with mass-produced
hardware disappear again beyond
Truckee into dark, frigid and
unpredictable mountains
untouched by man; products of
industrialization travel over, and
yet do not interact with nor harm
the surrounding unspoiled
physical environment.
But while the train passes over
the mountains, it stops in
Truckee, supplying the increasing
number of tourists. The, tgjvn
faces overcrowding, and appears
to have little chance of stopping
the inevitable commercialism and
urbanization.
Dale Strickland, who manages
the new Bank of America branch
in town and heads the Truckee
Chamber of Commerce, observes
that "people are going to come no
matter what." So he advocates
trying to control those who do

move in rather than fighting such
emigration.
Traffic Phase-Out
Strickland calls for the phasing
out of most tourist auto traffic in
Truckee through increased travel
by railroad. He laments the traffic
congestion on Interstate 80 near
Truckee on Sunday afternoons
during ski season, particularly
during a snowstorm. "After all,"
he says, "I'd rather see them come
in by train than by car."
But Strickland cites the
necessity for a public
transportation system to take
skiers from town to the
neighboring ski areas. "As we have
no funds for such a system, there
must be a federal subsidy. That
will only come after an outcry by
residents."
However, Truckee lacks the
lobbying power to secure such
funds at this point. The Chamber
of Commerce, a possible

influence, relies on voluntary
participation and donations by
residents, and is often inactive.
Most who come to the meetings
are businessmen who do not place
such a system as their top
priority.
Strickland also stresses strict
land use management on the part
of the Nevada County Board of
Supervisors, who authorize
building. "We've learned from the
Tahoe Basin," where less stringent
zoning laws have resulted in
unaesthetic building, he
comments. He points to the
''carefully planned"
Tahoe -Donner condominium
development underway not far
from Truckee's old main street.
But again, the problem of
voluntary control in sale of
private real estate creates a
skeptical outlook for the
preservation of Truckee's natural
beauty.


Truckee's Main Street
Somewhere northwest of Lake
Tahoe, hidden from the dozen
thriving ski areas which rapidly fill
up that vicinity each winter, the
sleepy little town of Truckee
edges toward discovery.
The rugged railroad-lumber
town steeped in Sierran frontier
memories cannot remain a secret
much longer because of its
locational value to the skiing
population.
Thirty days ago Amtrak began
making two scheduled stops a day
in Truckee — a definitive move in
channeling West Coast skiers
through the 125-year-old town.
With fuel rationing imminent and
special train rates for skiers likely,
the railroad seems the logical
alternative for never-say-die
downhillers.

crowd endangers the rusty sign on

One cannot hglp but recall the
fate of the Donner Party in 1847
when 22 feet of snow trapped 87
Pacific-bound settlers in this area

for an entire winter. Almost half
starved or froze to death, and
human flesh became part of the
regular diet. Years later, 22-foot
tree stumps provide grim evidence
of the snow level at which the
shivering pioneers chopped down
trees.
Truckee's retired constable and
fire chief, 65-year-old Tom
Dolley, enjoys recalling
particularly bad winters there
since he arrived in 1930. "In
1938, we had 12 feet of snow.
And in those days when it
snowed, everything stopped. The
only way to get around was to
wear snowshoes and pull a
handsled."
Dolley recalls so much snow
some years that houses would
burn to the ground before anyone
could find the fire hydrants under
all the snow. "The first alarm I
ever answered as fire chief was my
own house," Dolley laughs. "It
burned clear to the ground. We
saved the lot, though," he quips.
Town Is Changing
Despite the fact that Truckee's
one main street appears as it
always did, the town is changing.
The long row of boxy two-story
buildings has grudgingly replaced
most of the bars and bawdy
houses frequented by
muddy-booted, bearded woodsmen
and railroad maintenance men,
with more conservative
cafe-restaurants and inexpensive
hotels. A hardware store has taken
over where the blacksmith left
off, and the town jail is
antiquated.
The old Capitol Theatre, the
town's first brick building which
once saved many adjacent wooden
structures from a devastating fire
by resisting the spreading flames,
now houses an informal

restaurant. Its marquee advertises
chicken dinner bargains instead of
an opera company from Virginia
City which used to provide some
culture for the few refined enough
to appreciate it.
The railroad still rumbles
through town. But now the trains
deliver supplies for Truckee's
tourist business rather than pick
up the lumber and the ice, which
was pulled by horses from the
frozen Truckee River to be
packed in sawdust and hurried by
train to cities as far away as
Chicago.
Main Supply Route
Truckee remains on one of the
main trans-Sierra supply routes.
Thus trains 100 cars long
burdened with refrigerators,
canned foods, and Detroit
automobiles strain their way up
snowy mountain passes into
Truckee. Surrealistically, these
puffing iron contraptions loaded
down with mass-produced
hardware disappear again beyond
Truckee into dark, frigid and
unpredictable mountains
untouched by man; products of
industrialization travel over, and
yet do not interact with nor harm
the surrounding unspoiled
physical environment.
But while the train passes over
the mountains, it stops in
Truckee, supplying the increasing
number of tourists. The, tgjvn
faces overcrowding, and appears
to have little chance of stopping
the inevitable commercialism and
urbanization.
Dale Strickland, who manages
the new Bank of America branch
in town and heads the Truckee
Chamber of Commerce, observes
that "people are going to come no
matter what." So he advocates
trying to control those who do

move in rather than fighting such
emigration.
Traffic Phase-Out
Strickland calls for the phasing
out of most tourist auto traffic in
Truckee through increased travel
by railroad. He laments the traffic
congestion on Interstate 80 near
Truckee on Sunday afternoons
during ski season, particularly
during a snowstorm. "After all,"
he says, "I'd rather see them come
in by train than by car."
But Strickland cites the
necessity for a public
transportation system to take
skiers from town to the
neighboring ski areas. "As we have
no funds for such a system, there
must be a federal subsidy. That
will only come after an outcry by
residents."
However, Truckee lacks the
lobbying power to secure such
funds at this point. The Chamber
of Commerce, a possible

influence, relies on voluntary
participation and donations by
residents, and is often inactive.
Most who come to the meetings
are businessmen who do not place
such a system as their top
priority.
Strickland also stresses strict
land use management on the part
of the Nevada County Board of
Supervisors, who authorize
building. "We've learned from the
Tahoe Basin," where less stringent
zoning laws have resulted in
unaesthetic building, he
comments. He points to the
''carefully planned"
Tahoe -Donner condominium
development underway not far
from Truckee's old main street.
But again, the problem of
voluntary control in sale of
private real estate creates a
skeptical outlook for the
preservation of Truckee's natural
beauty.


Truckee's Main Street
Somewhere northwest of Lake
Tahoe, hidden from the dozen
thriving ski areas which rapidly fill
up that vicinity each winter, the
sleepy little town of Truckee
edges toward discovery.
The rugged railroad-lumber
town steeped in Sierran frontier
memories cannot remain a secret
much longer because of its
locational value to the skiing
population.
Thirty days ago Amtrak began
making two scheduled stops a day
in Truckee — a definitive move in
channeling West Coast skiers
through the 125-year-old town.
With fuel rationing imminent and
special train rates for skiers likely,
the railroad seems the logical
alternative for never-say-die
downhillers.
Subsequent development of
hotels, restaurants and stores
catering to this "tracks are back"
crowd endangers the rusty sign on
the outskirts of Truckee which
has listed its population at 1000
for almost two decades.
Despite some private
condominium development
prompted by the 1960 Olympics
at Squaw Valley just 15 minutes
away, and the completion of
Highway 80 connecting the town
with San Francisco, Truckee
remained isolated until recently.
Perhaps its harsh environment has
kept all but the hardiest away
until now. Biting cold winds
whistling through bleak
snow-covered mountains make its
surrounding environment spooky
if pot downright hostile in winter.
