# Students Manufacture Tower Of Beer
## 
### DON COX 
Mechanical engineering students yesterday demonstrated their solutions
to ecological design problems assigned to them by Profs. Robert McKim
and William Verplank, and unveiled a revolutionary energy alternative:
beer power.
While all students have become accustomed at one time or another with
the power of beer, even they would not have dreamed of the impact a can
of beer could have on transportation industries.
The students' problem called specifically for the construction of a
device that would travel the greatest possible horizontal distance powered
solely by a full can of beer. Since this was an ecological design, obviously
the device could not pollute, which ruled out the utilization of the can of
beer as a source of jet propulsion: the emission of beer from a well-shaken
can was to be considered an act of pollution.
The resulting designs, mostly tottering towers using energy generated
by dropping the beer can from the top of the tower, wobbled around the
inner Quad yesterday afternoon.
An energy shortage apparently hit even in this new field, since many
employed cans of soft drinks instead of beer. Observers speculated that the
shortage arose as a result of California liquor laws and from consumption
of the fuel the night before while students struggled to complete their
designs.
While it set no new land speed record, student Mike Love managed to
coax his machine the width of the Quad. A crowd of 100 people cheered
as Love took first place in the competition, and probably also a decent
grade in the class. His machine ran on Coke.
Other entries did not fare as well. Many rolled a half-foot and then
toppled over, "Laugh-In" style. Others did not even bother to roll the
half-foot before collapsing.
Wilson Hanna went to the trouble of making a steam car, using the beer
can as a boiler. "It was going OK till the chasis caught fire and messed up
the car," he said.
Verplank explained that the purpose of the problems was not to
actually develop a practical energy alternative but to give the students
design experience.
It was rumored late in the day, however, that French engineers were
busy measuring a certain tower in Paris to be converted into a mass transit
system.
