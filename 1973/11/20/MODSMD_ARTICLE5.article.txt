# Senate Passes Energy Crisis Bill

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — A bill declaring a
one-year nationwide fuel emergency
passed the Senate yesterday and was
sent to the House.
The bill authorizes, but does not
require, rationing.
The House cannot take the bill up
until at least Nov. 26, the day it
returns from its Thanksgiving recess.
The Senate deleted a provision to
tap the nation's naval petroleum
reserves but rejected most other
amendments, including one its

sponsors said would save fuel by
prohibiting busing school children for
racial balance.
Another amendment adopted
would permit Congress to terminate
the emergency after six months, if it
decides it is no longer needed.
The bill would require the President
to set up a system of fuel rationing
within 15 days, although it would be
up to him when or whether to put it
into effect. Nixon has said he hopes to
avoid rationing.
Rep. Brock Adams, D-Wash., issued
a statement on the bill, saying "I have
grave doubts about giving the
President a free hand to continue
pursuing his policies of making the
average American bear the full burden
of inflation and the energy shortage."
He said the measure would "enrich the
wealthy fuel interests."
Sunday Driving Ban
Charles Dißona, the President's
special assistant for fuel policies, told
Congress yesterday that a ban on
Sunday driving and closing of public
parks to automobiles are steps being
considered to help meet the energy

problem.
He also said New England and the
East Coast could run 50 percent short
of fuels this winter if voluntary and
mandatory controls are not quick
successes.
Dißona said one of the steps the
administration is considering to assure
home heating thermostats are set no
higher than 68 degrees is an immediate
20 percent reduction on the deliveries
of home heating fuels.
Dißona told a congressional joint
economic committee that rationing is
being considered seriously and said:
"Knocking out Sunday driving is a real
possibility."
He said other options include a ban
on fuels for private and corporate
airplanes and boats and an immediate
ban on the use of natural gas to fuel
decorative outside gas lamps.
Dißona said a Sunday driving ban
would save 660,000 barrels of gasoline
a day. The ban may be partial so
people could go to church.
Rationing Considered
A group of more than 80 persons
with the help of the Office of

Management and Budget is
"aggressively" considering a fuel
rationing plan, Dißona said.
Dißona said a sufficient supply of
fuel is now on hand to permit the
nation to continue its normal patterns
of energy consumption through
December.
He predicted the nation's fuel
supply this winter will run about 17 to
18 percent short, based on a normal
winter and continued cutbacks by the
Arabs.
Dißona said a 25 percent shortage
predicted recently by the oil industry's
American Petroleum Institute is based
on a more severe winter and less
voluntary cooperation than the
administration thinks is realistic.
But he said estimates of a shortage
of up to 50 percent for the first
quarter of next year, particularly along
the Atlantic seaboard and in the
Northeast, are realistic if large cuts in
the use of fuels don't begin
immediately.
