# U.S. Senate Votes Approval Of Hoover Library Funding
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
The United States Senate Thursday
passed a bill to provide $5 million in
matching grants for the construction
of the Hoover Institution's planned
library annex.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore., and passed by voice
vote, provides federal funds "to
recognize the 50 years of
extraordinary and selfless public
service of Herbert Hoover" and to
commemorate the 100 th anniversary
of Hoover's birth, Aug. 10, 1974.
Rep. Albert Quie, R-Minn., ranking
Republican on the House Education
and Labor Committee, plans to

introduce the bill in the House next
week.
If passed there, the bill will help
fund the Hoover Institution's planned
extension, to be built behind the Lou
Henry Hoover building.
Herbert Hoover, President of the
United States from 1929 until 1933,
was a member of the class of 1895. He
founded the Hoover Library here in
1919, and died in 1964.
Although the idea for a memorial
to Hoover seems to have originated
with Hatfield, the bill's final form —a
grant to the Hoover Institution —
represents the fruit of a long lobbying
effort by the institution's officials.

Lobbying for the bill was carried on
principally by Hoover Senior Fellow
and Associate Director Richard Burris,
who maintains a Washington office.
President Lyman chipped in by writing
letters in August to several senators,
but Associate Director of University
Relations Robert Freelen said, "The
effort was mainly Hoover's. We made
no attempt at a gigantic effort to
shepherd support for it."
Nevertheless, an alumnus who
worked for Cranston last summer says
University officials did ask him to
lobby for the bill.
Bruce Jaques, now an aide to Sen.
Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., who
graduated from Stanford in June, told
the Daily that he was approached last
spring by a University Relations
official. The official, whom Jaques
declined to identify, asked him to "see
if I could push the bill along a little."
Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell was reluctant to say exactly
where the idea for a grant to the
institution originated.
"There's no question that the idea
for an appropriate federal memorial to
the late President Hoover was Sen.
Hatfield's idea," Campbell said. "He
introduced a bill in July, 1971 to
establish a commission to consider
formal plans for a memorial to Mr.
Hoover."
Did the Hoover Institution first
suggest the specific form the memorial
would take? "There was general
agreement from the beginning amongst
Sen. Hatfield, the Hoover family, and
those of us concerned here at Stanford
University, that if there was to be a
memorial .. . the most appropriate
vehicle would be the Hoover
Institution for War, Revolution, and
Peace."
The bill, which Hatfield introduced
on March 29, was reported by the
Senate Labor and Public Welfare
Committee on Nov. 11. The
committee held no hearings, but
rewrote Hatfield's bill to restrict use of
the funds to construction of a new
building and to provide that the grant
will be the sole federal memorial to
Hoover.
The original bill had established a
capital fund to purchase books and
documents. Senate sources said the
changes were attempts to make the
spot grant more palatable to
bud get-conscious congressmen.

effort was mainly Hoover's. We made
no attempt at a gigantic effort to
shepherd support for it."
Nevertheless, an alumnus who
worked for Cranston last summer says
University officials did ask him to
lobby for the bill.
Bruce Jaques, now an aide to Sen.
Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., who
graduated from Stanford in June, told
the Daily that he was approached last
spring by a University Relations
official. The official, whom Jaques
declined to identify, asked him to "see
if I could push the bill along a little."
Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell was reluctant to say exactly
where the idea for a grant to the
institution originated.
"There's no question that the idea
for an appropriate federal memorial to
the late President Hoover was Sen.
Hatfield's idea," Campbell said. "He
introduced a bill in July, 1971 to
establish a commission to consider
formal plans for a memorial to Mr.
Hoover."
Did the Hoover Institution first
suggest the specific form the memorial
would take? "There was general
agreement from the beginning amongst
Sen. Hatfield, the Hoover family, and
those of us concerned here at Stanford
University, that if there was to be a
memorial .. . the most appropriate
vehicle would be the Hoover
Institution for War, Revolution, and
Peace."
The bill, which Hatfield introduced
on March 29, was reported by the
Senate Labor and Public Welfare
Committee on Nov. 11. The
committee held no hearings, but
rewrote Hatfield's bill to restrict use of
the funds to construction of a new
building and to provide that the grant
will be the sole federal memorial to
Hoover.
The original bill had established a
capital fund to purchase books and
documents. Senate sources said the
changes were attempts to make the
spot grant more palatable to
bud get-conscious congressmen.
The United States Senate Thursday
passed a bill to provide $5 million in
matching grants for the construction
of the Hoover Institution's planned
library annex.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore., and passed by voice
vote, provides federal funds "to
recognize the 50 years of
extraordinary and selfless public
service of Herbert Hoover" and to
commemorate the 100 th anniversary
of Hoover's birth, Aug. 10, 1974.
Rep. Albert Quie, R-Minn., ranking
Republican on the House Education
and Labor Committee, plans to

introduce the bill in the House next
week.
If passed there, the bill will help
fund the Hoover Institution's planned
extension, to be built behind the Lou
Henry Hoover building.
Herbert Hoover, President of the
United States from 1929 until 1933,
was a member of the class of 1895. He
founded the Hoover Library here in
1919, and died in 1964.
Although the idea for a memorial
to Hoover seems to have originated
with Hatfield, the bill's final form —a
grant to the Hoover Institution —
represents the fruit of a long lobbying
effort by the institution's officials.

Lobbying for the bill was carried on
principally by Hoover Senior Fellow
and Associate Director Richard Burris,
who maintains a Washington office.
President Lyman chipped in by writing
letters in August to several senators,
but Associate Director of University
Relations Robert Freelen said, "The
effort was mainly Hoover's. We made
no attempt at a gigantic effort to
shepherd support for it."
