the conclusion of a two-pan
series.)
[Case summary: O n
October 6, 1972, Ronald Beaty
escaped from the California
Institute for Men in Chino. One of
two guards transporting him was
killed. After learning of warrants
for their arrest, Andrea and
Douglas Burt surrendered on
October 23, 1972, asserting their
innocence. In July 1973 they
were convicted of second degree
murder in Superior Court of San
Bernardino County for alleged
participation in the escape. ]
The prosecution case rested on
Beaty's account and upon
attempts to corroborate it. The
primary corroboration consisted
of: 1) a statement by an
eyewitness that the profile of a
participant in the escape
resembled that of Doug Burt, 2)
testimony by a hardware salesman
that a woman resembling Andrea
Burt was present during the
purchase of bolt cutters which
might have been used in the
escape, and 3) a statement by the
Burts' landlady that a car
resembling one of the escape cars
had been parked outside the
Burts' apartment.
During the trial it was shown
that the witness who had allegedly
seen Doug Burt had initially told
police that she was quite unsure
of the identification.
Furthermore, her version of the
escape was in direct contradiction
to the Beaty version on crucial
points. It was also shown that the
initial accounts of the hardware
salesman barely mentioned a
woman in the alleged purchase of
bolt cutters. When shown a
photographic line-up which
included a picture of Andrea, he
not only failed to identify her but
selected another woman.
The defense ultimately
demonstrated through records of
the hardware company that bolt
cutters of the type used in the
escape had not been sold. Finally,
the defense demonstrated that at
the time the landlady purportedly
saw one of the ambush vehicles
outside her apartment, that
automobile was actually in the
Los Angeles International Airport,
in order to cope with this defense
finding, the landlady changed the
date at which she allegedly saw
the car.
Even' point raised by the
prosecution was answered by the
defense, usually by witnesses
related to police agencies or
discovered by the prosecution
during its investigation. In
addition, the defense established
by testimony of two witnesses
that, the Burts were in their
apartment in Hayward on the day
of the escape and demonstrated
several critical leads which implied
that other people, as yet
unidentified, were the actual
participants in the escape. The
defense was able to bring out in
court many of the
aforementioned illegal actions of
the police and the prosecution.
The response of the
prosecution was primarily
political. It did not refute the
defense case. Instead it distorted
the political views of the
defendants and imputed attitudes
which the defendants did not
hold. It baited the defendants for
their views and subjected defense
witnesses to political attack. The
principal theme of the
prosecutor's summary held that
the defendants' political views
were alien and would lead them to
support such an escape.
Therefore, they were presumably
involved.
Jurors Surveyed
This atmosphere had
substantial influence on the jury.
The original jury consisted of 10
people over 55 and two in
their. 30s. During the trial
three elderly people were replaced
by three younger alternates.
Initially the jury was divided
seven for conviction and five for
acquittal. Four of the five
youngest people were for

acquittal. It is now known from
affidavits sworn by jurors that
political arguments and fatigue
had considerable impact on their
deliberations.
For example, according to one
jurist, one of the outspoken
pro-conviction jurors stated that
"the issue in his mind from the
start of the trial was not whether
or not the defendants had
committed the crimes charged,
but whether they were capable of
committing them." According to
another juror this same person
stated, "Andrea Burt was guilty
for two reasons: first, she had
been in Cuba; second, she was a
member of Venceremos, a radical,
Communist organization. He
concluded that she was a menace
to society and should be locked
up."
Confronted with large amounts
of contradictory evidence the jury
decided to accept only that
information which was presented
to them as sworn testimony by
prosecution witnesses. They chose
to disregard major contradictions
in that testimony as elicited by
cross examination and the
unchallenged facts presented by
the defense.
More Harrassment
Following the verdict,
harrassment continued. Andrea's
mother, sister and friends were
told to "get out of town" by
deputies. When Doug Burt had an
episode of gastrointestinal
bleeding prison doctors did
nothing, asserting that he was
needlessly complaining. Despite a
court order, prison authorities
refuse to allow Andrea and Doug
to correspond.
The atmosphere was
epitomized by the probation
officer's reports to the judge
following the conviction: instead
of concerning himself with the
circumstances of the case, he
characterized the defendants as

politically deviant and
unreconstructed for insisting on
their innocence, and
recommended prolonged
incarceration to achieve a change
in their attitudes.
Appeal are pending. Bail has
been denied. The Burts are
serving indeterminate sentences of
five years to life in prison. Seven
others now face trial associated
with the Chino Case.
Political Trial History
From the Chicago Eight to the
Gainesville Eight, the government
has a long history of political
prosecutions involving widespread
illegal government actions. The
government has consistently lost
the most notorious of these cases
but has succeeded in many which
were less well known. The Chino
Case is one of the latter. In
general, repression has failed when
large numbers of citizens
understood government actions
and created an atmosphere in
which jurors could exercise
independent judgement.
Recent events strikingly affirm
that the price of liberty and
democracy is eternal vigilance.
However, many people who are
cognizant of the plundering of
democratic rights, have been
hesitant to act on grounds that
they must save themselves for the
crucial battle.
In my view defeating this
assault by government on citizens'
essential liberties is such a battle.
How many rights are we to
sacrifice so that government may
imprison people with divergent
views? How many innocent
people need be charged, how
much crime committed by
government in the name of law
and order, how much theft of
political liberty by police is
necessary before we citizens act to
insure that our rights prevail?

government has consistently lost
the most notorious of these cases
but has succeeded in many which
were less well known. The Chino
Case is one of the latter. In
general, repression has failed when
large numbers of citizens
understood government actions
and created an atmosphere in
which jurors could exercise
independent judgement.
Recent events strikingly affirm
that the price of liberty and
democracy is eternal vigilance.
However, many people who are
cognizant of the plundering of
democratic rights, have been
hesitant to act on grounds that
they must save themselves for the
crucial battle.
In my view defeating this
assault by government on citizens'
essential liberties is such a battle.
How many rights are we to
sacrifice so that government may
imprison people with divergent
views? How many innocent
people need be charged, how
much crime committed by
government in the name of law
and order, how much theft of
political liberty by police is
necessary before we citizens act to
insure that our rights prevail?

[Case summary: O n
October 6, 1972, Ronald Beaty
escaped from the California
Institute for Men in Chino. One of
two guards transporting him was
killed. After learning of warrants
for their arrest, Andrea and
Douglas Burt surrendered on
October 23, 1972, asserting their
innocence. In July 1973 they
were convicted of second degree
murder in Superior Court of San
Bernardino County for alleged
participation in the escape. ]
The prosecution case rested on
Beaty's account and upon
attempts to corroborate it. The
primary corroboration consisted
of: 1) a statement by an
eyewitness that the profile of a
participant in the escape
resembled that of Doug Burt, 2)
testimony by a hardware salesman
that a woman resembling Andrea
Burt was present during the
purchase of bolt cutters which
might have been used in the
escape, and 3) a statement by the
Burts' landlady that a car
resembling one of the escape cars
had been parked outside the
Burts' apartment.
During the trial it was shown
that the witness who had allegedly
seen Doug Burt had initially told
police that she was quite unsure
of the identification.
Furthermore, her version of the
escape was in direct contradiction
to the Beaty version on crucial
points. It was also shown that the
initial accounts of the hardware
salesman barely mentioned a
woman in the alleged purchase of
bolt cutters. When shown a
photographic line-up which
included a picture of Andrea, he
not only failed to identify her but
selected another woman.
The defense ultimately
demonstrated through records of
the hardware company that bolt
cutters of the type used in the
escape had not been sold. Finally,
the defense demonstrated that at
the time the landlady purportedly
saw one of the ambush vehicles
outside her apartment, that
automobile was actually in the
Los Angeles International Airport,
in order to cope with this defense
finding, the landlady changed the
date at which she allegedly saw
the car.
Even' point raised by the
prosecution was answered by the
defense, usually by witnesses
related to police agencies or
discovered by the prosecution
during its investigation. In
addition, the defense established
by testimony of two witnesses
that, the Burts were in their
apartment in Hayward on the day
of the escape and demonstrated
several critical leads which implied
that other people, as yet
unidentified, were the actual
participants in the escape. The
defense was able to bring out in
court many of the
aforementioned illegal actions of
the police and the prosecution.
The response of the
prosecution was primarily
political. It did not refute the
defense case. Instead it distorted
the political views of the
defendants and imputed attitudes
which the defendants did not
hold. It baited the defendants for
their views and subjected defense
witnesses to political attack. The
principal theme of the
prosecutor's summary held that
the defendants' political views
were alien and would lead them to
support such an escape.
Therefore, they were presumably
involved.
Jurors Surveyed
This atmosphere had
substantial influence on the jury.
The original jury consisted of 10
people over 55 and two in
their. 30s. During the trial
three elderly people were replaced
by three younger alternates.
Initially the jury was divided
seven for conviction and five for
acquittal. Four of the five
youngest people were for

acquittal. It is now known from
affidavits sworn by jurors that
political arguments and fatigue
had considerable impact on their
deliberations.
For example, according to one
jurist, one of the outspoken
pro-conviction jurors stated that
"the issue in his mind from the
start of the trial was not whether
or not the defendants had
committed the crimes charged,
but whether they were capable of
committing them." According to
another juror this same person
stated, "Andrea Burt was guilty
for two reasons: first, she had
been in Cuba; second, she was a
member of Venceremos, a radical,
Communist organization. He
concluded that she was a menace
to society and should be locked
up."
Confronted with large amounts
of contradictory evidence the jury
decided to accept only that
information which was presented
to them as sworn testimony by
prosecution witnesses. They chose
to disregard major contradictions
in that testimony as elicited by
cross examination and the
unchallenged facts presented by
the defense.
More Harrassment
Following the verdict,
harrassment continued. Andrea's
mother, sister and friends were
told to "get out of town" by
deputies. When Doug Burt had an
episode of gastrointestinal
bleeding prison doctors did
nothing, asserting that he was
needlessly complaining. Despite a
court order, prison authorities
refuse to allow Andrea and Doug
to correspond.
The atmosphere was
epitomized by the probation
officer's reports to the judge
following the conviction: instead
of concerning himself with the
circumstances of the case, he
characterized the defendants as

politically deviant and
unreconstructed for insisting on
their innocence, and
recommended prolonged
incarceration to achieve a change
in their attitudes.
Appeal are pending. Bail has
been denied. The Burts are
serving indeterminate sentences of
five years to life in prison. Seven
others now face trial associated
with the Chino Case.

From the Chicago Eight to the
Gainesville Eight, the government
has a long history of political
prosecutions involving widespread
illegal government actions. The

Following the verdict,
harrassment continued. Andrea's
mother, sister and friends were
told to "get out of town" by
deputies. When Doug Burt had an
episode of gastrointestinal
bleeding prison doctors did
nothing, asserting that he was
needlessly complaining. Despite a
court order, prison authorities
refuse to allow Andrea and Doug
to correspond.
The atmosphere was
epitomized by the probation
officer's reports to the judge
following the conviction: instead
of concerning himself with the
circumstances of the case, he
characterized the defendants as

politically deviant and
unreconstructed for insisting on
their innocence, and
recommended prolonged
incarceration to achieve a change
in their attitudes.
Appeal are pending. Bail has
been denied. The Burts are
serving indeterminate sentences of
five years to life in prison. Seven
others now face trial associated
with the Chino Case.
Political Trial History
From the Chicago Eight to the
Gainesville Eight, the government
has a long history of political
prosecutions involving widespread
illegal government actions. The
government has consistently lost
the most notorious of these cases
but has succeeded in many which
were less well known. The Chino
Case is one of the latter. In
general, repression has failed when
large numbers of citizens
understood government actions
and created an atmosphere in
which jurors could exercise
independent judgement.
Recent events strikingly affirm
that the price of liberty and
democracy is eternal vigilance.
However, many people who are
cognizant of the plundering of
democratic rights, have been
hesitant to act on grounds that
they must save themselves for the
crucial battle.
In my view defeating this
assault by government on citizens'
essential liberties is such a battle.
How many rights are we to
sacrifice so that government may
imprison people with divergent
views? How many innocent
people need be charged, how
much crime committed by
government in the name of law
and order, how much theft of
political liberty by police is
necessary before we citizens act to
insure that our rights prevail?

[Case summary: O n
October 6, 1972, Ronald Beaty
escaped from the California
Institute for Men in Chino. One of
two guards transporting him was
killed. After learning of warrants
for their arrest, Andrea and
Douglas Burt surrendered on
October 23, 1972, asserting their
innocence. In July 1973 they
were convicted of second degree
murder in Superior Court of San
Bernardino County for alleged
participation in the escape. ]
The prosecution case rested on
Beaty's account and upon
attempts to corroborate it. The
primary corroboration consisted
of: 1) a statement by an
eyewitness that the profile of a
participant in the escape
resembled that of Doug Burt, 2)
testimony by a hardware salesman
that a woman resembling Andrea
Burt was present during the
purchase of bolt cutters which
might have been used in the
escape, and 3) a statement by the
Burts' landlady that a car
resembling one of the escape cars
had been parked outside the
Burts' apartment.
During the trial it was shown
that the witness who had allegedly
seen Doug Burt had initially told
police that she was quite unsure
of the identification.
Furthermore, her version of the
escape was in direct contradiction
to the Beaty version on crucial
points. It was also shown that the
initial accounts of the hardware
salesman barely mentioned a
woman in the alleged purchase of
bolt cutters. When shown a
photographic line-up which
included a picture of Andrea, he
not only failed to identify her but
selected another woman.
The defense ultimately
demonstrated through records of
the hardware company that bolt
cutters of the type used in the
escape had not been sold. Finally,
the defense demonstrated that at
the time the landlady purportedly
saw one of the ambush vehicles
outside her apartment, that
automobile was actually in the
Los Angeles International Airport,
in order to cope with this defense
finding, the landlady changed the
date at which she allegedly saw
the car.
Even' point raised by the
prosecution was answered by the
defense, usually by witnesses
related to police agencies or
discovered by the prosecution
during its investigation. In
addition, the defense established
by testimony of two witnesses
that, the Burts were in their
apartment in Hayward on the day
of the escape and demonstrated
several critical leads which implied
that other people, as yet
unidentified, were the actual
participants in the escape. The
defense was able to bring out in
court many of the
aforementioned illegal actions of
the police and the prosecution.
The response of the
prosecution was primarily
political. It did not refute the
defense case. Instead it distorted
the political views of the
defendants and imputed attitudes
which the defendants did not
hold. It baited the defendants for
their views and subjected defense
witnesses to political attack. The
principal theme of the
prosecutor's summary held that
the defendants' political views
were alien and would lead them to
support such an escape.
Therefore, they were presumably
involved.
Jurors Surveyed
This atmosphere had
substantial influence on the jury.
The original jury consisted of 10
people over 55 and two in
their. 30s. During the trial
three elderly people were replaced
by three younger alternates.
Initially the jury was divided
seven for conviction and five for
acquittal. Four of the five
youngest people were for

acquittal. It is now known from
affidavits sworn by jurors that
political arguments and fatigue
had considerable impact on their
deliberations.
For example, according to one
jurist, one of the outspoken
pro-conviction jurors stated that
"the issue in his mind from the
start of the trial was not whether
or not the defendants had
committed the crimes charged,
but whether they were capable of
committing them." According to
another juror this same person
stated, "Andrea Burt was guilty
for two reasons: first, she had
been in Cuba; second, she was a
member of Venceremos, a radical,
Communist organization. He
concluded that she was a menace
to society and should be locked
up."
Confronted with large amounts
of contradictory evidence the jury
decided to accept only that
information which was presented
to them as sworn testimony by
prosecution witnesses. They chose
to disregard major contradictions
in that testimony as elicited by
cross examination and the
unchallenged facts presented by
the defense.
