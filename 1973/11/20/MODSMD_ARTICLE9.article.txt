# Community Participation Urged
## Planners Offer Alternatives 
### 
• Brooke Kantor

Having read Mr. Robert
Augsburger's letter in response to
Jim Francesconi's Daily column
of Nov. 2, it appears to me that
Mr. Augsburger has some
misconceptions regarding
Stanford Shopping Center and a
basic understanding of the
position taken by People Planning
for Stanford.
Granting Mr. Augsburger's
assertion that revenues produced
from rents at Stanford Shopping
Center go into student financial
aid and individual instruction and
research accounts, it does not
follow that the shopping center
necessarily serves an overall
socially productive function in
our community. Being one of the
first shopping centers built in this
country, Stanford Shopping
Center still represents much of the
worst in our affluent, suburban
culture.
As Jim Francesconi articulated
in his Nov. 2 column, it is a
sterile, si n gl e - p u r p ose
environment. Stanford's proposal
for a 30 percent expansion of the
shopping center calls for more of
the same, the rationale being to
keep Stanford "competitive" with
Eastridge, Hillsdale, and other
new developments. Such logic is
symptomatic of the insanity built
into all large, single-purposed
American institutions.
Stanford's goal of obtaining
revenue for scholarships and
grants certainly has merit, but the
means of procuring it are no
different from those backers of
ill-planned development, who
advocate unlimited and traditional
patterns of growth to stabilize the
economy. In our region, this ethic
has led to our entrapment by the
automobile, the Manhattanization
of the San Francisco skyline, an
inadequate yet costly BART
system, such monstrosities as the
Great American Theme Park in
Santa Clara, and of course,
shopping centers that venerate the
automobile and the checkbook.
University Should Provide Model
Why such development?
Because it keeps a good amount
of capital flowing to a number of
small, but highly organized
interests. In the case of the
Stanford Shopping Center, it
might be understandable if the
party to gain were a slick real
estate outfit or a union fearful of
unemployment, someone who

didn't care or could not afford to
be concerned. But Stanford is a
university where intellect is
cultivated and models for an
improved physical and cultural
environment are being developed.
However, much of this research
operates in a vacuum and is
indeed supported by the
perpetuation of environmental ills
that we are trying to overcome.
How ironic it would be for a
recipient of funds generated by
shopping center revenue were a
social scientist researching the
process of alienation in our
suburban culture. As an East Palo
Alto resident once remarked
during the Willow Expressway
battle two years ago: "Stanford
will push the expressway down
our throats and then a few years
later will send out a team of
sociologists to discover what went
wrong."
I dispute Mr. Augsburger's
claim that merely "conceptual
ideas about the future of Stanford
Shopping Center" were laid out at
the meeting last December. The
proposal laid out by the Rouse
Corporation was quite specific in
details. Though much criticism
was offered at that meeting, it
became clear that the purpose in
Mr. Augsburger's presentation was
not to listen to criticism, but to
staunchly defend the need for a
30 percent expansion of the
shopping center. The only thing
"conceptual" at that meeting was
the possibility of construction of
low/moderate income housing to
offset the new influx of workers
on Stanford lands.
Alternative Plan
As a reaction to this
philosophy, People Planning for
Stanford was formed. Rather than
heap criticism but offer no
solutions, our idea is to develop
an alternative plan to better
reflect the needs of the entire
Midpeninsula community. This
report will be available in a week
or two.
We resent the insinuation that
People Planning for Stanford "Is
.. . laying back to play a game of
protest and confrontation — an
inhumane game which is wasteful
of human and financial
resources." Such rhetoric is an
attempt to discredit a feasible
alternative before its release to the
public.
Mr. Augsburger and Mr. Andy
Doty of University public
relations were present at an
informal presentation of our
shopping center plan. Nothing was
held back from them at that
meeting. We received feebaok
from them as well. Naturally, we
shall be seeking wider support for
our proposal from groups and
individuals in the Stanford-
Midpeninsula community, much
as Mr. Augsburger will be
generating enthusiasm for thr

Rouse proposal. We are confident
that the City of Palo Alto and the
public will see our plan as serving
the broader interests of the
community.
Discussion Encouraged
People Planning for Stanford
has always intended to discuss the
Rouse Corporation's and our own
proposals with Mr. Augsburger
and other University officials, as
soon as our report is completed.
However, we shall regard these
discussions as philosophical
dialogue and not bargaining
sessions. Back room meetings are
contrary to the founding
principles of People Planning for
Stanford and other affiliated
groups.
Debate over the use of
Stanford lands must be kept in
the open and receive the imput of
all interest groups. Our purpose is
not to strike a deal with Stanford,
but to sell our ideas to the public.
It is hypocritical of Stanford to
boast of the open door policy at
105 Encina Hall while demanding
that talks between high level
University and Palo Alto staff
officials be closed to the public.
Mr. Augsburger fears that
People Planning for Stanford is
out to get the University. We're
not out to get anybody or merely
protest the shopping center
expansion. Our concern is that the
public take more interest in
decisions that will have impact on
their lives. Stanford University
owns title to the shopping center
land, but the physical and social
impact of shopping center
expansion affects every citizen on
the Midpeninsula. Hence, we all
own an interest in the shopping
center's political outcome.
