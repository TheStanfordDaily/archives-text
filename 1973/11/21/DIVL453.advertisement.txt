Following is a background paper prepared by Vice Provost
Raymond F. Bacchetti and Administrative Intern Jay Schoenau
for the Board of Trustees, recommending an increase in general
tuition from $3,135 this year to $3,375 for 1974-75. Date
obtained on a confidential basis from other universities has been
)deleted. (Other tuition rates within Stanford for 1974-75 will be
$3,600 for the Graduate School of Business, and $3,570 for
M.D. candidates in the School of Medicine.)
While this recommendation in the last analysis repre
sents a judgment by University officers, that judgment
has its roots in five sets of considerations.
The first-general economic considerations—provides
information on relevant factors whose causes are inde
pendent of University actions but whose effects are
influential in the life of the University.
The second—Operating Budget considerations—deals
with institutional income and expense projections and
relationships.
These first two together suggest a narrow range of
tuition alternatives which are then checked critically
against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of important
considerations.
The third-projected tuition increases at other institu
tions—is a frame of reference factor showing simply
whether tuition will be in line with those private institu
tions with which we share most of our common candi
dates.
The fourth -public/private cost differential- provides
one check on cost as a factor in the enrollment choices
of those admitted.
The fifth-the relationship between tuition, financial
aid policy, and student enrollment choices-provides
another check on cost by examining the effect of these
policies upon Stanford's ability to attract and enroll a
diverse and high quality student body.
General economic considerations
Both costs and incomes have been rising nationally
for many years, and so has tuition. It is useful, therefore,
to examine the relationship of tuition to two primary
indices of cost and income growth. The two indices
which were examined, and their estimated values for
1974-75, are:
a) The rate of growth in inflation, estimated to be
slightly under 5% in the Bay Area in 1974-75.
b) The rate of growth in per capita personal disposa
ble income, estimated to be approximately 7.4% in
1974-75.
These indices pertain to Stanford's costs as well as to
the costs and resources of the families of our students.
Salaries and wages comprise more than 60% of the
University's Operating Budget, another 20% is largely
wage-driven, and the remainder is affected by rates of
increase at least as great as the overall inflation factor.
Some major expenses, such as library acquisitions and
campus utilities can be expected to rise at twice the
overall inflation rate or more. Though there is no perfect
correlation between these indices and the University's
costs of operation, neither is there reason to believe that
local and national economic factors will not be highly
influential in determining budget needs for 1974-75.
Looking at these measures from the point of view of
individuals who pay tuition, and ignoring for the
moment the help provided by the financial aid program
to those with demonstrated financial need, one sees that
a family's costs are sure to rise and so, quite probably, is
family income.
II a family's educational costs continue to claim a
constant percentage of disposable income no serious
overall perturbations in family economic planning would
appear to be introduced. If education were becoming
either less or more expensive in relation to disposable
income, then important issues would be raised.
Operating Budget considerations
Tuition income comprises 49%. of the income to the
Operating Budget, and it is principally a product of three
factors: autumn enrollment, returning enrollment ratios
in succeeding quarters, and the tuition rate. The follow
ing table provides three year's figures on the first two
factors:

General economic considerations
Both costs and incomes have been rising nationally
for many years, and so has tuition. It is useful, therefore,
to examine the relationship of tuition to two primary
indices of cost and income growth. The two indices
which were examined, and their estimated values for
1974-75, are:
a) The rate of growth in inflation, estimated to be
slightly under 5% in the Bay Area in 1974-75.
b) The rate of growth in per capita personal disposa
ble income, estimated to be approximately 7.4% in
1974-75.
These indices pertain to Stanford's costs as well as to
the costs and resources of the families of our students.
Salaries and wages comprise more than 60% of the
University's Operating Budget, another 20% is largely
wage-driven, and the remainder is affected by rates of
increase at least as great as the overall inflation factor.
Some major expenses, such as library acquisitions and
campus utilities can be expected to rise at twice the
overall inflation rate or more. Though there is no perfect
correlation between these indices and the University's
costs of operation, neither is there reason to believe that
local and national economic factors will not be highly
influential in determining budget needs for 1974-75.
Looking at these measures from the point of view of
individuals who pay tuition, and ignoring for the
moment the help provided by the financial aid program
to those with demonstrated financial need, one sees that
a family's costs are sure to rise and so, quite probably, is
family income.
II a family's educational costs continue to claim a
constant percentage of disposable income no serious
overall perturbations in family economic planning would
appear to be introduced. If education were becoming
either less or more expensive in relation to disposable
income, then important issues would be raised.
Operating Budget considerations
Tuition income comprises 49%. of the income to the
Operating Budget, and it is principally a product of three
factors: autumn enrollment, returning enrollment ratios
in succeeding quarters, and the tuition rate. The follow
ing table provides three year's figures on the first two
factors:

Following is a background paper prepared by Vice Provost
Raymond F. Bacchetti and Administrative Intern Jay Schoenau
for the Board of Trustees, recommending an increase in general
tuition from $3,135 this year to $3,375 for 1974-75. Date
obtained on a confidential basis from other universities has been
)deleted. (Other tuition rates within Stanford for 1974-75 will be
$3,600 for the Graduate School of Business, and $3,570 for
M.D. candidates in the School of Medicine.)
While this recommendation in the last analysis repre
sents a judgment by University officers, that judgment
has its roots in five sets of considerations.
The first-general economic considerations—provides
information on relevant factors whose causes are inde
pendent of University actions but whose effects are
influential in the life of the University.
The second—Operating Budget considerations—deals
with institutional income and expense projections and
relationships.
These first two together suggest a narrow range of
tuition alternatives which are then checked critically
against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of important
considerations.
The third-projected tuition increases at other institu
tions—is a frame of reference factor showing simply
whether tuition will be in line with those private institu
tions with which we share most of our common candi
dates.
The fourth -public/private cost differential- provides
one check on cost as a factor in the enrollment choices
of those admitted.
The fifth-the relationship between tuition, financial
aid policy, and student enrollment choices-provides
another check on cost by examining the effect of these
policies upon Stanford's ability to attract and enroll a
diverse and high quality student body.
