I<
Two factors stand out. On the increase side, the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is sub
stantially up over earlier projections. On the decrease
side, graduate enrollment is down significantly. These
two factors essentially offset one another.
J
There are other, more minor, changes projected, but
the overall conclusion to be drawn is that the increase in
tuition income for 1974-75 will be primarily a function
of a change in the rate rather than in other factors.
Further Operating Budget considerations bear upon
tuition income as one of the several income and expense
factors in the overall budget equation, an equation
characterized by powerful inertial forces and which must
be balanced in 1974-75.
In short, how much of a tuition increase is needed?
Though not a governing consideration, neither is institu
tional need a trivial one, for maintenance and improve
ment of the academic program and its supporting func
tions must weigh heavily in all financial decisions.
Projected tuition increases at other institutions
The institutions with which Stanford competes for
students are relatively easy to identify. The projected
1974-75 average undergraduate tuition at six other insti
tutions with which we compared ourselves last year will
be $3,380. In the group of nine private institutions
enrolling 10 or more 1973-73 freshmen who were also
admitted to Stanford, the projected average under
graduate tuition is $3,272.
Public I Private Cost Differential
One area that has been of ongoing concern is the
number of students admitted to Stanford who chose to
attend less costly public institutions. Information has
been collected for the past four years of the type of
institutions chosen by these admitted freshmen who
declined to come to Stanford and appears as follows:
Class of Class of Class of Class of
1974 1975 1976 1977
Number Admitted 2243 2360 2417 2443
Number Not Coming 842 928 931 949
(ex-admittees)
% Choosing Public 21% 24% 26% 23%
% Choosing Private 79% 76% 74% 77%
The data indicate that the percent electing to attend
public instituions has remained relatively constant with
in a few percentage points of 25%, a figure that, while
significant, is well below a level which warrants alarm.
This information will continue to be collected and
analyzed to monitor Stanford's competitive position vis
a-vis public institutions.
To understand better the background of ex-admittees
and their reasons for decling to attend Stanford, a de
tailed study was done of those admitted to the Class of
1976. (Philip L. Curry, David S. P. Hopkins, Sally C.
Main, Freshman Admissions and Financial Aid at Stan
ford, 1972-73, Academic Planning Office, Stanford Uni
versity, June 1973.)
The following results of that study bear on the pub
lic/private issue:
I) Of those ex-admittees choosing to attend public
institutions, 56% chose one of the eight campuses of the if
University of California. Thus, not surprisingly, the UC
system was our major competitor among public institu
tions in 1972, but, as a system, drew less freshmen away
(14%) than the most competitive private institution
Harvard/Radcliffe (18%). Interestingly, among the UC
campuses, Davis rather than Berkeley was the pre
dominant drawing institution.

To understand better the background of ex-admittees
and their reasons for decling to attend Stanford, a de
tailed study was done of those admitted to the Class of
1976. (Philip L. Curry, David S. P. Hopkins, Sally C.
Main, Freshman Admissions and Financial Aid at Stan
ford, 1972-73, Academic Planning Office, Stanford Uni
versity, June 1973.)
The following results of that study bear on the pub
lic/private issue:
I) Of those ex-admittees choosing to attend public
institutions, 56% chose one of the eight campuses of the if
University of California. Thus, not surprisingly, the UC
system was our major competitor among public institu
tions in 1972, but, as a system, drew less freshmen away
(14%) than the most competitive private institution
Harvard/Radcliffe (18%). Interestingly, among the UC
campuses, Davis rather than Berkeley was the pre
dominant drawing institution.

Two factors stand out. On the increase side, the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is sub
stantially up over earlier projections. On the decrease
side, graduate enrollment is down significantly. These
two factors essentially offset one another.
J
There are other, more minor, changes projected, but
the overall conclusion to be drawn is that the increase in
tuition income for 1974-75 will be primarily a function
of a change in the rate rather than in other factors.
Further Operating Budget considerations bear upon
tuition income as one of the several income and expense
factors in the overall budget equation, an equation
characterized by powerful inertial forces and which must
be balanced in 1974-75.
In short, how much of a tuition increase is needed?
Though not a governing consideration, neither is institu
tional need a trivial one, for maintenance and improve
ment of the academic program and its supporting func
tions must weigh heavily in all financial decisions.
Projected tuition increases at other institutions
The institutions with which Stanford competes for
students are relatively easy to identify. The projected
1974-75 average undergraduate tuition at six other insti
tutions with which we compared ourselves last year will
be $3,380. In the group of nine private institutions
enrolling 10 or more 1973-73 freshmen who were also
admitted to Stanford, the projected average under
graduate tuition is $3,272.
