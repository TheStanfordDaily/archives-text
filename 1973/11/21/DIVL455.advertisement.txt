2) For 58% of those -x-admittees choosing public
institutions, the cost of a Stanford education was cited
as a strongly influential factor in their decision not to
come to Stanford; in contrast, cost was cited as a major
factor by only 10% of those electing private institutions.
These figures represent 15.1%. and 7.4% respectively of
the total group of ex-admit tees.
Data for ex-admit tees of the Class of 1977 is present
ly being analyzed to probe further the issues of which
public institutions are chosen and why.
Relationship between tuition rate, financial aid policy,
and enrollment choices
Any increase in the tuition rate will result in a higher
level of overall undergraduate financial need and lead to
greater demand upon current financial aid resources.
The present undergraduate financial aid policy states
that the University will meet the demonstrated financial
need of undergraduates through a combination of gift
aid, term-time jobs, and loans. No change in that policy
. is presently comtemplated.
As regards University gift funds, sufficient allocations
will be proposed in the 1974-75 budget recommenda
tions for those undergraduate (and graduate student)
Financial aid programs dependent on General Funds to
meet a) ongoing scholarship commitments, b) increases
in those commitments necessitated by the tuition in
crease, c) new commitments extended to 1974 entering
students, and d) new commitments to current non-aid
students who cross the need threshold by reason of the
tuition increase.
In respect to non-University scholarship aid, no drop
is foreseen in funds for undergraduates; in fact the
California State Scholarship Programâ€”the major source
of outside undergraduate scholarships-recently an
nounced that maximum stipends for those entering col
lege for the first time after January I, 1974, will be
raised from $2,200 to $2,500.
Regarding self-help, the use of University term jobs
will continue at the present level. No short term prob
lems in the availability of University, government, or
Federally insured (FISL) loan funds arc foreseen.
Finally, possible problems in the availability of FISL
funds to middle income families arising out of new
Federal eligibility guidelines have been temporarily
averted by substituting University loan funds for those
of FISL in the cases of families with "felt need."
("Felt need," as distinct from "demonstrated need," refers to
instances where, using the need assessment formula developed by
the College Scholarship Service and adopted by most major
colleges and universities, a student and his family can not
demonstrate need, yet because of cash flow problems or larger
than anticipated expenditures at Stanford, the student and his
family feel they have a need problem. This type of need can
often be met with loans and term-time jobs, while demonstrated
need is usually met with some combination of scholarship, loan
funds and term time jobs.)
One area of continuing concern is that of graduate
student financial aid and the impact any tuition increase
has on it. Loans constitute an important and increasing
source of graduate financial aid.
At present a task force is reviewing current lending
procedures and resources in the professional and grad
uate schools. This group will propose measures to ensure
the long run availability of loan funds and to improve
coordination regarding loan criteria and amounts, the
terms under which funds are lent, and the total debts
incurred.
The overall issue of graduate financial aid, as well as
that of declining graduate enrollment, will come under
especially careful review in the 1 c >74-75 budget process.
Concern has been expressed that Stanford has a
"middle class" problem in that tuition increases over the
past five years have forced middle income families either
to send their children to less expensive public institu
tions or to make inordinately large financial sacrifices in
order to send them to high quality private institutions.
Two studies done at other institutions provide some
information on this subject. A study done at MIT found
that the income distribution of the families of students
attending MIT was higher than that of the nation and
that tuition, room, and board charges combined have
taken a decreasing percentage of family income of all
income quartiles over the past twenty years. (Student
