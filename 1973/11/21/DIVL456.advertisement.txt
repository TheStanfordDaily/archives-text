A Princeton study of 43 select colleges and univer
sities (public and private) revealed that a) educational
rather than financial considerations were the primary
determinants of college applications, and b) students
from middle income families were as likely to enroll at
costly private institutions as those from higher or lower
income levels. (Richard R. Spies, The Future of Private
Colleges; The Effect of Rising Costs on College Choice,
Industrial Relations Section, Princeton University,
1973.)
The concept of a "middle class" problem is an elusive
one that does not readily yield the degree of precision
requisite for definitive research. Our own investigations
do not yet clearly show whether or not Stanford has
such a problem.
Information has been gathered on the class of 1976
and preliminary results for the class of 1977 are available
for comparison. For the class of 1976 the following
results emerged:
1) The occupational status of fathers of male under
graduates enrolled in 1966 and 1972 was dramatically
different. Comparing the two, those with professional
backgrounds increased by 44%(from 285 to 410), those
with blue collar agricultural backgrounds increased by
57.4% (from 68 to 107), and those from clerical/sales
backgrounds decreased by 14.7% (from 116 to 99).
2) Admitted freshman aid applicants of high aca
demic rating from middle income families had a lower
probability of enrolling (.41) than those from either
higher (.48) or lower (.52) income families. (The com
parable figures for the class of 1977 are .54, .48, and
.59, respectively.)
3) As mentioned before, the cost at Stanford was
cited as a major factor by about one-quarter of those
who decided to go to another institution.
A two part explanation for the lower enrollment
probability and the citing of costs can be offered.
The first is that both phenomena are functions of the
College Scholarship Service formula used by most col
leges and universities to calculate demonstrated financial
need. This formula appears to overestimate the expected
contribution of middle income families, asking more of
them than they can afford and also making them in
eligible for many forms of aid.
The second is that applicants are not sufficiently
aware of Stanford's willingness to review the financial
situation of families and to make aid available to them if
they are eligible. Thus they may turn down Stanford's
admissions offer because of financial problems when
such problems might be resolved or at least abated
through loans, jobs, or small grants in special cases.
In recognition of this situation, several actions were
taken during 1973-74 to be more responsive to the
difficulties middle income families face.
In their interviews, public statements, and publica
tions, the Admission Office took special pains to inform
prospective applicants of Stanford's concern for middle
income problems and to emphasize the availability of
financial aid.
The Financial Aid Office looked more closely at
middle income situations, took cash flow problems into
account, and used self-help and some gift aid to close
any discovered gaps between demonstrated need strictly
measured and family resources.
The Director of Financial Aid was influential in en
couraging the College Scholarship Service to slow the
acceleration of the contribution formula in the middle
range, thereby making middle income families more
eligible for aid.
Finally the Financial Aid Office sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness of the
University to reconsider family financial situations if it
was felt that aid awards were not adequate. One hundred
families responded to this letter and in over half the
cases upward revisions in aid were made. Fifty-six of
these 100 applicants enrolled.
As noted above, preliminary results of data on the
undergraduate Class of 1977 indicate that the enroll
ment rates for middle income students rose over those
for the Class of 1976. It is yet too early to tell whether
this change is the result of the actions taken last year.
The problems of middle income families will receive
further analysis in 1974-75 and results of outgoing
studies will continue to inform financial aid policy and
budget considerations.
