# PG&E Cuts University Gas Supply
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
The Pacific Gas and Electric
Company has cut off University
supplies of natural gas for a period of
"at least 24 hours" which began at 7
a.m. yesterday, according to Plant
Services Director Dan DeYoung.
The move, a result of the
University's "interruptible" fuel
contract, has forced Plant Services to
/uel their central heating plant with
neating oil from a 135-thousand gallon
reserve supply. DeYoung estimates
that the plant, which provides heat to
most University buildings, including
Stanford Hospital, consumed almost
one fifth of the oil supply yesterday.
Under present federal regulations,
the University is forbidden to buy
more heating oil this year than it used
in the same period last year, and the
present reserve supply represents the
legal maximum for the entire winter.
"We didn't expect the first cutoff
until December," said DeYoung.
"PG&E told us that we could expect
at least 3.6 days without gas this
winter, but if it's unusually cold we
could be without gas for much longer.
We're really hoping that the
government will come up with a new
fuel-allotment program quickly which
will enable us to buy more oil."
"If we should have to cut back heat
to save fuel," he continued, "naturally
we'll consider that we have to heat the
hospital first. Cowell Health Center
and family residences in Escondido
Four and Five also have top priority."
DeYoung noted that heat will be
shut off in all university buildings
except dorms, the two major libraries,
and a few laboratories during the
Thanksgiving recess period that begins
tonight. In addition, the University has
stopped heating its swimming pools
for as long as the PG&E gas cutoff
remains in effect. DeYoung had
previously announced that heat and
lights will be shut down over
Christmas recess to conserve fuel.
Medical Center officials announced
this week that they too have taken
steps to reduce energy consumption.
The center's decorative fountains have
been shut off, while lighting, escalator,
and air conditioning services have been
reduced.
DeYoung indicated that the
University is considering several
long-range programs to control energy
use. "We're like the man who's bought
a Cadillac," he noted. "In the past, he
didn't have to worry about how much
gas the thing burned: he just wanted a
good car. Now, though, it's costing
him more than he thought. We've got
to be a lot more careful with our
power use."

Medical Center officials announced
this week that they too have taken
steps to reduce energy consumption.
The center's decorative fountains have
been shut off, while lighting, escalator,
and air conditioning services have been
reduced.
DeYoung indicated that the
University is considering several
long-range programs to control energy
use. "We're like the man who's bought
a Cadillac," he noted. "In the past, he
didn't have to worry about how much
gas the thing burned: he just wanted a
good car. Now, though, it's costing
him more than he thought. We've got
to be a lot more careful with our
power use."
The Pacific Gas and Electric
Company has cut off University
supplies of natural gas for a period of
"at least 24 hours" which began at 7
a.m. yesterday, according to Plant
Services Director Dan DeYoung.
The move, a result of the
University's "interruptible" fuel
contract, has forced Plant Services to
/uel their central heating plant with
neating oil from a 135-thousand gallon
reserve supply. DeYoung estimates
that the plant, which provides heat to
most University buildings, including
Stanford Hospital, consumed almost
one fifth of the oil supply yesterday.
Under present federal regulations,
the University is forbidden to buy
more heating oil this year than it used
in the same period last year, and the
present reserve supply represents the
legal maximum for the entire winter.
"We didn't expect the first cutoff
until December," said DeYoung.
"PG&E told us that we could expect
at least 3.6 days without gas this
winter, but if it's unusually cold we
could be without gas for much longer.
We're really hoping that the
government will come up with a new
fuel-allotment program quickly which
will enable us to buy more oil."
"If we should have to cut back heat
to save fuel," he continued, "naturally
we'll consider that we have to heat the
hospital first. Cowell Health Center
and family residences in Escondido
Four and Five also have top priority."
DeYoung noted that heat will be
shut off in all university buildings
except dorms, the two major libraries,
and a few laboratories during the
Thanksgiving recess period that begins
tonight. In addition, the University has
stopped heating its swimming pools
for as long as the PG&E gas cutoff
remains in effect. DeYoung had
previously announced that heat and
lights will be shut down over
Christmas recess to conserve fuel.
