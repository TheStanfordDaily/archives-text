# Tax Status 'Mumbo-Jumbo'
## Anti-Nixon Effort Repressed 
### 
The insistence by President
Lyman's office last week, that the
Stanford Impeach Nixon
organization should stop using the
facilities of Memorial Church,
constitutes nothing less than
another attempt to repress dissent
and political activity on the
Stanford campus. As such, it is
typical of the attacks on political
organizing that have consistently
characterized President Lyman's
activities since he was appointed
to his office in 1970.
These attacks have ranged from
his unilateral establishment of the
Campus Judicial Panel, and the
purge of Stanford radicals which
quickly followed, to the firing of
Bruce Franklin, to more subtle
techniques like dropping hints last
year that student groups should
not become involved with support
for the Farah strike, and to the
recent hassles being meted out to
the Chicano and Black
communities on campus.
The attack on the campus
impeachment drive is being
masked by a lot of legal
mumbo-jumbo over the
University's tax-exempt status. In
fact, this is not by any means the
first instance when this sham issue
has been used to cut back campus
political activity.
Recently, for example, the
University has refused to allow
"political" fund-raising events to
be conducted in campus facilities

(while, for some mysterious
reason, the Public Events office
insists that such activities can be
carried on in "public" facilities
like the Palo Alto schools).
Danger Not Clear
To put this narrow legal issue
in context, it should be pointed
out that it is by no means clear
that such activities would by any
means endanger the University's
tax exemption. Any half-assed
lawyer from Standard Oil knows
that the Internal Revenue Code is
a maze of complex rules, open to
various interpretation and
manipulation to the benefit of
wealthy taxpayers (and
non-taxpayers).
Once upon a time, when we
were all more naive about the
nature of this University, it might
have been thought that President
Lyman's battery of high-paid
laywers might take this issue on,
and fight through the courts for
the rights of Stanford students,
staff and faculty to exercise their
First Amendment privileges. As
this latest issue points out,
however, far from defending the
constitutional rights of the
Stanford community, Prsident
Lyman and his staff are actively
seeking out any mechanism they
can lay their hands on to suppress
such activities.
Taking a broader view, the very
idea of Stanford University
endangering its tax-exempt status
is patently ridiculous. Stanford
plays a vital role in providing
"cheap" research and
development for the wealthiest of
America's corporations, and in
insuring a steady flow of bright,
young technicians, business
people, and legal expertise to keep
the wheels of industry and profits
well-greased. The oil companies
will sooner lose their depletion
allowance than Stanford will lose
its tax-exempt status.
Rumbles
A decade ago, the country was
beginning to rumble. The
oppressed people of the United
States were demanding
recognition, the ghettoes were
smoldering, and at Berkeley the
Free Speech Movement was born,
to enable students to bring
meaningful activity to the
campuses. At the end of the
decade, Richard Nixon was in
power in Washington and Richard
Lyman was installed in his present
office.
The job of both these men was
the same — to repress the
dissident elements, to put an end
to the development of the Third
World communities, and to return
their respective institutions to the
purposes they were intended to
serve. The activities of Lyman and
his staff should be opposed no less
than the activities of the Nixon
regime.
Threats and ultimatums like
the directive to close down the

Church cainnot be tolerated if we
are ever again to become a free
nation.

techniques like dropping hints last
year that student groups should
not become involved with support
for the Farah strike, and to the
recent hassles being meted out to
the Chicano and Black
communities on campus.
The attack on the campus
impeachment drive is being
masked by a lot of legal
mumbo-jumbo over the
University's tax-exempt status. In
fact, this is not by any means the
first instance when this sham issue
has been used to cut back campus
political activity.
Recently, for example, the
University has refused to allow
"political" fund-raising events to
be conducted in campus facilities

(while, for some mysterious
reason, the Public Events office
insists that such activities can be
carried on in "public" facilities
like the Palo Alto schools).
Danger Not Clear
To put this narrow legal issue
in context, it should be pointed
out that it is by no means clear
that such activities would by any
means endanger the University's
tax exemption. Any half-assed
lawyer from Standard Oil knows
that the Internal Revenue Code is
a maze of complex rules, open to
various interpretation and
manipulation to the benefit of
wealthy taxpayers (and
non-taxpayers).
Once upon a time, when we
were all more naive about the
nature of this University, it might
have been thought that President
Lyman's battery of high-paid
laywers might take this issue on,
and fight through the courts for
the rights of Stanford students,
staff and faculty to exercise their
First Amendment privileges. As
this latest issue points out,
however, far from defending the
constitutional rights of the
Stanford community, Prsident
Lyman and his staff are actively
seeking out any mechanism they
can lay their hands on to suppress
such activities.
Taking a broader view, the very
idea of Stanford University
endangering its tax-exempt status
is patently ridiculous. Stanford
plays a vital role in providing
"cheap" research and
development for the wealthiest of
America's corporations, and in
insuring a steady flow of bright,
young technicians, business
people, and legal expertise to keep
the wheels of industry and profits
well-greased. The oil companies
will sooner lose their depletion
allowance than Stanford will lose
its tax-exempt status.

A decade ago, the country was
beginning to rumble. The
oppressed people of the United
States were demanding
recognition, the ghettoes were
smoldering, and at Berkeley the
Free Speech Movement was born,
to enable students to bring
meaningful activity to the
campuses. At the end of the
decade, Richard Nixon was in
power in Washington and Richard
Lyman was installed in his present
office.
The job of both these men was
the same — to repress the
dissident elements, to put an end
to the development of the Third
World communities, and to return
their respective institutions to the
purposes they were intended to
serve. The activities of Lyman and
his staff should be opposed no less
than the activities of the Nixon
regime.

The insistence by President
Lyman's office last week, that the
Stanford Impeach Nixon
organization should stop using the
facilities of Memorial Church,
constitutes nothing less than
another attempt to repress dissent
and political activity on the
Stanford campus. As such, it is
typical of the attacks on political
organizing that have consistently
characterized President Lyman's
activities since he was appointed
to his office in 1970.
These attacks have ranged from
his unilateral establishment of the
Campus Judicial Panel, and the
purge of Stanford radicals which
quickly followed, to the firing of
Bruce Franklin, to more subtle
techniques like dropping hints last
year that student groups should
not become involved with support
