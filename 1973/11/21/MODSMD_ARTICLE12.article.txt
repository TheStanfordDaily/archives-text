# Strong Role Maintained
## Med Students Aid Decisions 
### 
Several points made in Mr. Amylon's two recent
articles (Daily Nov. 12 and 13) are important and
require comment.
It is not true that students do not participate in
decisions in the School. Students have participated
as voting members of most of the committees of the
School in the past two years, including those dealing
with curriculum development, admissions,
long-range planning, patient care, primary care and
financial aid. Students served on the search
committee which recommended my appointment,
on all eight of the committees that have been
involved since that time in searches for new
chairmen of departments and on the search
committee for the Assistant Vice President for
Medical Affairs. Students serve on the Faculty
Senate and on the Executive Committee of the
School.
Mr. Amylon implies that the minority admissions
program is somehow under threat. This charge is
irresponsible and absolutely not correct. There is a
strong commitment to the minority admissions
program in the faculty and administration. Evidence
of this commitment includes the decision by the
faculty to strive for a minority group representation
of at least 20 percent of the entering 1974 class as
compared with 14 percent of the 1973 class and 12
percent before that. More important, these goals
have been met or exceeded every year since
1969-70.
The Senate Committee on Admissions Policy
recommended that there be increased liaison
between the School's two admissions committees
(the Regular Admissions Committee and Minority
Admissions Committee). Steps to improve this
liaison were proposed by the chairmen of the two
committees to the membership of the two
committees. It was explicit that only those steps
which were approved by the membership of each
committee would be placed into operation. Part of
the proposal was considered to be desirable by the
two committees and is in operation; part was not
and is not in operation. Increased liaison seems to
me to be reasonable and desirable, and I have
supported it. I have heard nothing from any
member of the Minority Admissions Committee in
the way of concern over their effectiveness, much
less "survival," because of the increased liaison
between the two committees.
Student Role
A major concern of Mr. Amylon's and a number
of other students is the role of a student member of
the admissions committee as the sole person who
interviews candidates for admission. To begin with,
the issue is not one of participation in the
admissions process, nor whether students should
serve as voting members on the admissions
committees, but, rather, whether or not the
admissions procedure should allow an applicant to
be rejected by the sole determination of a student
member of the admissions committee. This never
has been the case in the Minority Admissions
Committee and has been the case only during the
1972-73 year in the Regular Admissions Committee.
In order to understand the nature of this
problem, it is necessary to realize that there were
4,131 applicants for the 86 places in the class
admitted to the School of Medicine this September.
Of these, 939 were selected as the most promising in

terms of the evaluation that could be carried out
from the record.
This included letters of recommendation, record
of academic achievement, aptitude test results and
the pattern of scholastic and extracurricular activity
of the applicant. It is this group who are
interviewed. The range within this group is narrow;
all so selected are exceptionally well qualified for
medical school and, in fact, are representative of the
most promising students who apply to medical
schools in this country. It is very largely on the basis
of the interview that those of this group who are
offered places in the School are selected.
Qualified Judgment
The purpose of the interview is to determine to
what extent the candidate has those personal and
intellectual qualities that are important for one who
is to become an exceptionally able physician. It is
important — I believe critical — that this judgment
be made by people who are as well qualified as
possible to understand what personal and
intellectual qualities are necessary for a physician.
For this purpose, the faculty are selected for
their outstanding ability as educators of medical
students and physicians and for their experience
with the admissions process and in evaluating the
progress of students.
In contrast, students have very much less
background and experience for a judgment about
those personal qualities which are important in a
physician. This is not to suggest that the quality of
students as perceptive and able men and women is
less than the faculty, but rather that their
qualifications for making these determinations are
less. Nor do I imply that students cannot be
expected to have exceedingly valuable input into
these judgments, just as they can and do during
their clinical years of medical school when they
make judgments about the treatment of patients.
Faculty and Student Judgment
However, in the treatment of patients as well as
in rejection of an applicant, the difference in
qualifications between students and faculty make it
important, if not necessary-, that a faculty member
as well as a student be involved in the judgment.
It is at this critical point in the decision about
the admission of students that the faculty must
exercise their fundamental academic responsibility.
I should add that Mr. Amylon's sole comment on
these views is that they are "lame" and "based on
political considerations" rather than on "academic
considerations." Such a comment merely attests to
the relative lack of experience and judgment with
which I am concerned.
Finally, I should comment on Mr. Amylon's
remarks about selection of students who serve on
the admissions committees. I see no reason why
members of the admissions committees should be
viewed as being representative of particular
constituencies and therefore selected by election
from those constituencies. Indeed, such a viewpoint
seems to be singularly inappropriate in the case of
admissions committees. The responsibility of the
committees to the School and University, for
selection of one of those two groups — students and
faculty — whose quality determines the quality of
the University.

Affairs and Dean of the School of Medicine.)
