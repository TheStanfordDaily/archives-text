Tax Clarification Sought
Editor:
The warning from University administrators to Dean Kelly
regarding use of Memorial Church for impeachment activities raises
several questions. Has the IRS actually warned Stanford that its tax
exempt status was imperiled? Has any University been denied tax
exemption because of political activity on campus? What is the
technical difference between using University-owned sound
equipment on University-owned White Plaza, to advocate
impeachment, and using a University-owned telephone for the same
purpose?
We do know that churches in Palo Alto have lent their facilities for
similar activites without losing their tax exemption. In Stanford
classrooms, faculty members frequently criticize or defend
government policies, notably on such questions as the poverty
program, the treatment of minorities, development of the SST, and
nuclear stockpiling. Presumably, University secretaries using University
typewriters have typed the notes and manuscripts used by these
professors. President Lyman himself has called for certain changes in
government programs for student aid.
The issue is one of how we define the world "politics." If it is
defined broadly enough to include any and all advocacy regarding
government policies then freedom at Stanford will be dangerously
stifled. On the other hand, it might well be inappropriate for any part
of the University to become involved in partisan politics.
But impeachment is not a partisan issue. Congressman Paul
McCloskey and Senator Edward Brooke are leading Republicans
urging the dismissal or resignation of Richard Nixon. Impeachment
becomes political in the partisan sense when members of either party
view it only as a question of strategy, of what's best for their party.
To Dean Kelly and to many others at Stanford the impeachment of
Nixon is a moral issue. Nixon has admitted the secret bombing of a
neutral country and the falsification of military records. He has
impounded funds appropriated by Congress in clear violation of the
Constitution. He has attempted to bribe a federal judge, and he
knowingly approved an illegal plan for burglary, wire tapping and mail
tampering.
A number of other charges against him remain to be proven but he
has used every possible means to prevent relevant evidence from
coming to light. Many Americans believe therefore that Richard

Nixon is a criminal and that Constitutional procedures for removing
him must be undertaken if democratic government is to survive.
The question of impeachment is controversial, but it is not
necessarily more "political" than other issues of public policy on
which professors frequently offer opinions in the classroom. So I
suggest that the University seek clarification from the IRS before
Memorial Church's phone is disconnected from the impeachment
campaign, and before a dangerous precedent is set.

For the past seven years, the African continent has been struck by
one of the most severe droughts the world has ever seen. The lack of
rain has brought famine and disease to over thirty million people. An
estimated 1.5 million people have already died as a direct result of the
drought, and the lives of many times that number are in peril because
the drought has claimed their animals and crops — their only means of
survival.
The ASSU Council of Presidents urges all members of the Stanford
community to support Faculty Club chef Dave "Big Daddy"
McCullum and the members of the Black Students Union in their
efforts to raise money for the African Famine Relief Fund.
To raise funds, they are selling hot meals delivered to your door for
$1.50. Each meal comes with potato salad, cole slaw, and cookies, and
the choice of entrees includes barbequed beef ribs, fried chicken, and
fried fish. For the price, these meals easily surpass the offerings of
local restaurants.
Meals can be ordered any day of the week by calling 322-5794
before 8:30 p.m. Deliveries are made between 7 and 12 p.m. The
program will last until December 12th.
In addition, at the Big Game, "Big Daddy" and the BSU will be
selling box lunches containing sandwiches and fruit at four different
locations near the stadium.
Please support their program so that the drought victims can eat
until the rain returns.

defined broadly enough to include any and all advocacy regarding
government policies then freedom at Stanford will be dangerously
stifled. On the other hand, it might well be inappropriate for any part
of the University to become involved in partisan politics.
But impeachment is not a partisan issue. Congressman Paul
McCloskey and Senator Edward Brooke are leading Republicans
urging the dismissal or resignation of Richard Nixon. Impeachment
becomes political in the partisan sense when members of either party
view it only as a question of strategy, of what's best for their party.
To Dean Kelly and to many others at Stanford the impeachment of
Nixon is a moral issue. Nixon has admitted the secret bombing of a
neutral country and the falsification of military records. He has
impounded funds appropriated by Congress in clear violation of the
Constitution. He has attempted to bribe a federal judge, and he
knowingly approved an illegal plan for burglary, wire tapping and mail
tampering.
A number of other charges against him remain to be proven but he
has used every possible means to prevent relevant evidence from
coming to light. Many Americans believe therefore that Richard

Nixon is a criminal and that Constitutional procedures for removing
him must be undertaken if democratic government is to survive.
The question of impeachment is controversial, but it is not
necessarily more "political" than other issues of public policy on
which professors frequently offer opinions in the classroom. So I
suggest that the University seek clarification from the IRS before
Memorial Church's phone is disconnected from the impeachment
campaign, and before a dangerous precedent is set.

For the past seven years, the African continent has been struck by
one of the most severe droughts the world has ever seen. The lack of
rain has brought famine and disease to over thirty million people. An
estimated 1.5 million people have already died as a direct result of the
drought, and the lives of many times that number are in peril because
the drought has claimed their animals and crops — their only means of
survival.
The ASSU Council of Presidents urges all members of the Stanford
community to support Faculty Club chef Dave "Big Daddy"
McCullum and the members of the Black Students Union in their
efforts to raise money for the African Famine Relief Fund.
To raise funds, they are selling hot meals delivered to your door for
$1.50. Each meal comes with potato salad, cole slaw, and cookies, and
the choice of entrees includes barbequed beef ribs, fried chicken, and
fried fish. For the price, these meals easily surpass the offerings of
local restaurants.
Meals can be ordered any day of the week by calling 322-5794
before 8:30 p.m. Deliveries are made between 7 and 12 p.m. The
program will last until December 12th.
In addition, at the Big Game, "Big Daddy" and the BSU will be
selling box lunches containing sandwiches and fruit at four different
locations near the stadium.
Please support their program so that the drought victims can eat
until the rain returns.

The warning from University administrators to Dean Kelly
regarding use of Memorial Church for impeachment activities raises
several questions. Has the IRS actually warned Stanford that its tax
exempt status was imperiled? Has any University been denied tax
exemption because of political activity on campus? What is the
technical difference between using University-owned sound
equipment on University-owned White Plaza, to advocate
impeachment, and using a University-owned telephone for the same
purpose?
We do know that churches in Palo Alto have lent their facilities for
similar activites without losing their tax exemption. In Stanford
classrooms, faculty members frequently criticize or defend
government policies, notably on such questions as the poverty
program, the treatment of minorities, development of the SST, and
nuclear stockpiling. Presumably, University secretaries using University
typewriters have typed the notes and manuscripts used by these
professors. President Lyman himself has called for certain changes in
government programs for student aid.
The issue is one of how we define the world "politics." If it is
defined broadly enough to include any and all advocacy regarding
government policies then freedom at Stanford will be dangerously
stifled. On the other hand, it might well be inappropriate for any part
of the University to become involved in partisan politics.
