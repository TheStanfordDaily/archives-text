# Taped Lectures On The Rise
## 
### 
Faculty members in increasing
numbers at Stanford are
discovering the uses of
educational technology — in
particular, of recording their own
lectures.
In consequence, the
circulation of recordings in the
Meyer Undergraduate Audio
Library has jumped more than
300 percent, from 5203 in the fall
1967 to 17,227 last spring.
Located in the southeast
corner of Meyer Library, the
Audio Library is a room equipped
with 50 listening stations and
4500 sound recordings.
Originally the audio library was
primarily used for spare time
entertainment, when students

listened to recorded music, or
perhaps poetry. Now it is part of
regular activities largely because
professors have discovered the
value of recording their class
lectures and depositing them in
the library.
The human biology program,
an interdisciplinary offering in
science and the social sciences,
now routinely makes lectures for
its basic courses available by this
means. The recordings are heavily
used by students wanting to
review course work.
Forty courses in 21
departments now use the audio
services for discs or tapes which
students are required or requested
to hear. More than 1500 items a

week are checked out for use
during peak periods.
Assistant director of libraries
Robert A. Goiter would like to
see the collection expanded in
several ways, but is at present able
to make only limited progress.
The resources of the Archive of
Recorded Sound, for example, are
not generally available since funds
for their use were restricted last
year.
"All kinds of things go on in
speech that don't show up in the
printed page," said Goiter. "It
would be fascinating, for example,
to hear the talk given by Henry
Kissinger before he became
Secretary of State on how foreign
policy decisions should be made."
The unconscious ironies and
subtle inflections in such a
recording may add drama.
