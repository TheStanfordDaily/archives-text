# Illegal Gift Cited

CHICAGO (AP) - Disguised <
payments of more than $175,000 r
were made by the Associated Milk i
Producers Inc., to a lawyer who i
said in sworn testimony yesterday
that he passed the same amount i
on to a political operative for '
AMPI, the nation's largest dairy
cooperative.
Sworn testimony lias prompted i
charges that AMPI made illegal
contributions to President Nixon's
1972 election campaign in return
for favors to the milkmen. Nixon i
denied the charges Saturday in an
address to the Associated Press ,
Managing Editors Association
Convention in Florida. *
The lawyer, Stuart H. Russell,
of Oklahoma City, said AMPI paid
him the money between
December 1969 and April 1972
under the guise of legal fees for
professional services he said he did
not perform.
Under subpoena, Russell
produced copies of cancelled
checks and other bank records
showing that he paid a total of
$176,828 to Robert Lilly, the
giant cooperative's former
political staffer who was
implicated in previous sworn
testimony as having made illegal
political contributions.
In a sworn deposition taken
yesterday, Russell said he did not
know what his payments to Lilly
went for but, "I can make some
assumptions based on what I hear
on TV and read in the
newspapers."
Russell said his own idea of the
financial arrangement was that
AMPI wanted to cover up business
it did with big-name political law
firms. These inchided, he said, the
firms of Herbert Kalmbach,
President Nixon's former personal

counsel; John Connolly, former
Treasury secretary under Nixon,
and John Mitchell, Nixon s first
attorney general.
Russell said the
money-channeling arrangement
was set up by Robert O. Isham,
former comptroller of AMPI, and
verified by Harold Nelson, former
general manager.
Russell said he was first
approached by Lilly in December
1969. "He said: 'I need
$5,000 . . . Harold Nelson told me
to call you to see if you can make
arrangements,' " Russell said.
Federal law prohibits use of
corporation money for political
donations.
