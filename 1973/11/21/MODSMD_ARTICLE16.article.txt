# Experts Disagree On Shortage
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - The
question go longer is whether or
not there|is an energy shortage.
There is. 'the controversy now, at
least among economists, concerns
our reaction to the shortage.
The answer is a critical one
because the assumption made
dictates the action advocated. It is
here that the pros, who generally
agree that the country will soon
be flirting with recession, go their
separate ways.
Walter Heller, former Kennedy
administration economic adviser
and now a University of
Minnesota professor, disagrees
with Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz, who believes the public is
over-reacting.
"Over-reacting? Indeed not,"
said Heller. "The energy shortage
could actually convert a mild
economic expansion into
something that looks like a
recession."
Milton Friedman of the
University of Chicago, an
advocate of free markets, a
Republican and a forecaster of
recession even before the Mideast
oil embargo, believes the nation
has "enormously exaggerated" the
shortage.
Total crude oil consumption
costs $40 billion a year, he
explained. The anticipated
short-fall of 10 percent reduces
that by $4 billion, or just
four-tenths of 1 percent of the
nation's gross national product.
And yet, he adds, "the stock
market has been saying a
reduction of four-tenths of 1
percent over the next two or three
years reduces the value
ofAmerican enterprise by 1
percent. It makes no sense."
Friedman believes Washingotn
has produced some of the
exaggerated mood, "because of

the silly, foolish, arbitrary things
they're contemplating."
He referred to rationing, taxing
and the like.
"Simply allow prices to rise.
Get Washington off the back of
the economy. A 10 to 15 percent
price rise will eliminate the
shortage as a serious problem," he
said. It will, he said, be an
incentive to produce, an incentive
to conserve.
Rationing Suggested
Paul Samuelson, the Nobel
laureate at the Massachusetts
Institute 'of Technology,
maintains that if there is a
shortage of energy its availability
should be restricted, but not in
ways that would reduce
incentives.
One technique he believes
should at least be considered is
ration tickets that could be so.d
legally in a "white" rather than
black market. That is, an
individual who chose not to pay
high prices could sell his tickets to
someone who urgently needed
and was willing to pay for them.
He would consider combining
this technique with price increases
for the producer and a retail tax,
the proceeds going to public
transit and research into the
liquification and gasification of
coal.
Leif Olsen, vice president and
economist of First National City
Bank in New York, beglieves the
situation is exaggerated, although
he too foresees a recession if the
oil boycott continues more than
six months.
It is a severe problem, he
concedes, but he says some
estimates of the consequences,
such as 8 percent unemployment,
"are just not real."
"In order to produce 8 percent
unemployment in the second

quarter of 1974," he said, "you'd
have to have an annual rate of
decline of 14 to 18 percent in the
first two quarters." Nothing like
that has happened in decades.
Albert Sindlinger, the
consumer opinion pollster, claims
that despite what some
administration officials might
believe, "the people are
discounting what they see in the
press. People were prepared for
this."
Sindlinger's continuous surveys
of consumer opinion support his
present view. "I expected th» j
energy crisis would really depress
consumer confidence," he said. "I
expected a fantastic decline, but
we got an increase."
Shortages Predicted
But as many of the economists
point out, the early effects might
not be felt equally throughout the
country. Shortages of gasoline and
heating oil, and factory closings
and layoffs, are expected to
appear in pockets.
In some areas these shortages
already are evident. They will
become more common in the next
few weeks, especially as heating
oil becomes scarce along the
Eastern seaboard, which depends
heavily on imports.
Factories and workers are

expected to be affected soon,
especially in industries that rely
heavily on petrochemicals. For
such industries the problem is
expected to be not so much a
shortage of fuel but of raw
materials.
"Already a very severe shortage
of petrochemicals is developing,"
said Alan Grenspan of
Townsend-Greenspan, Inc., a
consulting firm.
Estimating the job loss in
advance is difficult. One
consulting economist said almost
all his clients have had energy task
forces for the past year but that
most are still asking rather than
answering questions.
The confusion is evident in the
airline industry. While some
executives feel that cancelling
some flights might result in
permanent economics, others are
calling the disruption of schedules
devastating.
Otto Eckstein, former Johnson
administration adviser and now
head of Data Resources, Inc., a
company that operates an
incredibly complex econometric
model, or mathematical matrix of
the economy, foresees a sharp rise
in joblessness.

and now a University of
Minnesota professor, disagrees
with Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz, who believes the public is
over-reacting.
"Over-reacting? Indeed not,"
said Heller. "The energy shortage
could actually convert a mild
economic expansion into
something that looks like a
recession."
Milton Friedman of the
University of Chicago, an
advocate of free markets, a
Republican and a forecaster of
recession even before the Mideast
oil embargo, believes the nation
has "enormously exaggerated" the
shortage.
Total crude oil consumption
costs $40 billion a year, he
explained. The anticipated
short-fall of 10 percent reduces
that by $4 billion, or just
four-tenths of 1 percent of the
nation's gross national product.
And yet, he adds, "the stock
market has been saying a
reduction of four-tenths of 1
percent over the next two or three
years reduces the value
ofAmerican enterprise by 1
percent. It makes no sense."
Friedman believes Washingotn
has produced some of the
exaggerated mood, "because of

the silly, foolish, arbitrary things
they're contemplating."
He referred to rationing, taxing
and the like.
"Simply allow prices to rise.
Get Washington off the back of
the economy. A 10 to 15 percent
price rise will eliminate the
shortage as a serious problem," he
said. It will, he said, be an
incentive to produce, an incentive
to conserve.
Rationing Suggested
Paul Samuelson, the Nobel
laureate at the Massachusetts
Institute 'of Technology,
maintains that if there is a
shortage of energy its availability
should be restricted, but not in
ways that would reduce
incentives.
One technique he believes
should at least be considered is
ration tickets that could be so.d
legally in a "white" rather than
black market. That is, an
individual who chose not to pay
high prices could sell his tickets to
someone who urgently needed
and was willing to pay for them.
He would consider combining
this technique with price increases
for the producer and a retail tax,
the proceeds going to public
transit and research into the
liquification and gasification of
coal.
Leif Olsen, vice president and
economist of First National City
Bank in New York, beglieves the
situation is exaggerated, although
he too foresees a recession if the
oil boycott continues more than
six months.
It is a severe problem, he
concedes, but he says some
estimates of the consequences,
such as 8 percent unemployment,
"are just not real."
"In order to produce 8 percent
unemployment in the second

quarter of 1974," he said, "you'd
have to have an annual rate of
decline of 14 to 18 percent in the
first two quarters." Nothing like
that has happened in decades.
Albert Sindlinger, the
consumer opinion pollster, claims
that despite what some
administration officials might
believe, "the people are
discounting what they see in the
press. People were prepared for
this."
Sindlinger's continuous surveys
of consumer opinion support his
present view. "I expected th» j
energy crisis would really depress
consumer confidence," he said. "I
expected a fantastic decline, but
we got an increase."
Shortages Predicted
But as many of the economists
point out, the early effects might
not be felt equally throughout the
country. Shortages of gasoline and
heating oil, and factory closings
and layoffs, are expected to
appear in pockets.
In some areas these shortages
already are evident. They will
become more common in the next
few weeks, especially as heating
oil becomes scarce along the
Eastern seaboard, which depends
heavily on imports.
Factories and workers are

expected to be affected soon,
especially in industries that rely
heavily on petrochemicals. For
such industries the problem is
expected to be not so much a
shortage of fuel but of raw
materials.
"Already a very severe shortage
of petrochemicals is developing,"
said Alan Grenspan of
Townsend-Greenspan, Inc., a
consulting firm.
Estimating the job loss in
advance is difficult. One
consulting economist said almost
all his clients have had energy task
forces for the past year but that
most are still asking rather than
answering questions.
The confusion is evident in the
airline industry. While some
executives feel that cancelling
some flights might result in
permanent economics, others are
calling the disruption of schedules
devastating.
Otto Eckstein, former Johnson
administration adviser and now
head of Data Resources, Inc., a
company that operates an
incredibly complex econometric
model, or mathematical matrix of
the economy, foresees a sharp rise
in joblessness.
NEW YORK (AP) - The
question go longer is whether or
not there|is an energy shortage.
There is. 'the controversy now, at

our reaction to the shortage.
The answer is a critical one
because the assumption made

here that the pros, who generally
agree that the country will soon
be flirting with recession, go their

oil embargo, believes the nation
has "enormously exaggerated" the
shortage.
Total crude oil consumption
costs $40 billion a year, he
explained. The anticipated
short-fall of 10 percent reduces
that by $4 billion, or just
four-tenths of 1 percent of the
nation's gross national product.
And yet, he adds, "the stock
market has been saying a
reduction of four-tenths of 1
percent over the next two or three
years reduces the value
ofAmerican enterprise by 1
percent. It makes no sense."
Friedman believes Washingotn
has produced some of the
exaggerated mood, "because of

the silly, foolish, arbitrary things
they're contemplating."
He referred to rationing, taxing
and the like.
"Simply allow prices to rise.
Get Washington off the back of
the economy. A 10 to 15 percent
price rise will eliminate the
shortage as a serious problem," he
said. It will, he said, be an
incentive to produce, an incentive
to conserve.
Rationing Suggested
Paul Samuelson, the Nobel
laureate at the Massachusetts
Institute 'of Technology,
maintains that if there is a
shortage of energy its availability
should be restricted, but not in
ways that would reduce
incentives.
One technique he believes
should at least be considered is
ration tickets that could be so.d
legally in a "white" rather than
black market. That is, an
individual who chose not to pay
high prices could sell his tickets to
someone who urgently needed
and was willing to pay for them.
He would consider combining
this technique with price increases
for the producer and a retail tax,
the proceeds going to public
transit and research into the
liquification and gasification of
coal.
Leif Olsen, vice president and
economist of First National City
Bank in New York, beglieves the
situation is exaggerated, although
he too foresees a recession if the
oil boycott continues more than
six months.
It is a severe problem, he
concedes, but he says some
estimates of the consequences,
such as 8 percent unemployment,
"are just not real."
"In order to produce 8 percent
unemployment in the second

quarter of 1974," he said, "you'd
have to have an annual rate of
decline of 14 to 18 percent in the
first two quarters." Nothing like
that has happened in decades.
Albert Sindlinger, the
consumer opinion pollster, claims
that despite what some
administration officials might
believe, "the people are
discounting what they see in the
press. People were prepared for
this."
Sindlinger's continuous surveys
of consumer opinion support his
present view. "I expected th» j
energy crisis would really depress
consumer confidence," he said. "I
expected a fantastic decline, but
we got an increase."
Shortages Predicted
But as many of the economists
point out, the early effects might
not be felt equally throughout the
country. Shortages of gasoline and
heating oil, and factory closings
and layoffs, are expected to
appear in pockets.
In some areas these shortages
already are evident. They will
become more common in the next
few weeks, especially as heating
oil becomes scarce along the
Eastern seaboard, which depends
heavily on imports.
Factories and workers are

expected to be affected soon,
especially in industries that rely
heavily on petrochemicals. For
such industries the problem is
expected to be not so much a
shortage of fuel but of raw
materials.
"Already a very severe shortage
of petrochemicals is developing,"
said Alan Grenspan of
Townsend-Greenspan, Inc., a
consulting firm.
Estimating the job loss in
advance is difficult. One
consulting economist said almost
all his clients have had energy task
forces for the past year but that
most are still asking rather than
answering questions.
The confusion is evident in the
airline industry. While some
executives feel that cancelling
some flights might result in
permanent economics, others are
calling the disruption of schedules
devastating.
Otto Eckstein, former Johnson
administration adviser and now
head of Data Resources, Inc., a
company that operates an
incredibly complex econometric
model, or mathematical matrix of
the economy, foresees a sharp rise
in joblessness.
NEW YORK (AP) - The
question go longer is whether or
not there|is an energy shortage.
There is. 'the controversy now, at
least among economists, concerns
our reaction to the shortage.
The answer is a critical one
because the assumption made
dictates the action advocated. It is
here that the pros, who generally
agree that the country will soon
be flirting with recession, go their
separate ways.
Walter Heller, former Kennedy
administration economic adviser
and now a University of
Minnesota professor, disagrees
with Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz, who believes the public is
over-reacting.
"Over-reacting? Indeed not,"
said Heller. "The energy shortage
could actually convert a mild
economic expansion into
something that looks like a
recession."
