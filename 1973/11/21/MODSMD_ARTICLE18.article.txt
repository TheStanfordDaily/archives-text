# Problems Plague Conservation Group

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shortages of time
and money have been the main problems
facing the state Coastal £one Conservation
Commission in its first year, the commission's
chairman said today.
However, he said, the body set up by Prop.
20 is processing development permits as fast
or faster than most other governmental
groups.
"The commLsion is working in a general
sense," said Melvin B. Lane. He was the first
witness before a legislative committee
reviewing the first year's work of the
commission.
A funding problem has come about, he
said, because $2 million to $2.5 million in
expected federal funds have not come
through. He said the commission must try to
make up the deficit from private foundation
or state funds.

"If we are to catch up, we are going to
need about $1 million for the coming year,"
Lane told Rep. Alan Sieroty, D— Beverly Hills,
chairman of the Assembly Select Committee
on Coastal Zone Resources, meeting here.
He added that the commission would
reduce its request for state money if the
federal funds should come through after all.
Lane said some solution must be found for
shortage of time to spend on planning and
permit reviews by the state and regional
coastal commissions. Many members of the
commission are local officials who sometimes
skip meetings because of the demands of their
primary jobs, Lane explained.
The statewide commission and the South
Coast Regional Commission have had the
most trouble in finding sufficient time for
their work, he said.
"I'm suggesting that we need to choose

alternates for elected officials" to substitute
when the officials must be absent, Lane said.
He added that the most serious attendance
problem has been with county supervisors and
big-city councilmen on the coastal groups.
Other representatives of the state, the
commissions, and environmentalists were to
testify later in the day on the effectiveness of
the coastal regulating bodies.
