# Lockout Ires Residents
## 
### RALPH COHEN 
Single graduate students in
Escondido Village are protesting
the decision of University housing
officials to close and lock their
residences during the Christmas
break.
Housing officials have directed
them to vacate their apartments
during the quarter break, unless
they have a "compelling reason"
to remain on campus, in an effort
to conserve energy.
Those students who must stay
on campus will be placed in
special housing, as yet
undesignated, and will probably
not have access to their
apartments.
Within 24 hours of receiving
announcements of the shut down
last Saturday night, petitions
against the University decision
were being circulated in three of
the four Escondido complexes
where single graduate students are
housed.
Although the protests are not
coordinated among the three
complexes, initiators of the
petitions cite the same grievances.
All expressed fears about security,
loss of kitchen privileges, and
disruption of studies.
Emily Bassman, a graduate
student in psychology who drew
up the petition in Blackwelder
Court, complained that the
closing discriminated against
singles, since married couples were
not asked to leave.
"Residents appreciate the

University's concern over the
energy crisis and the closing of
undergraduate dormitories since
the undergraduates usually go
home," Bassman wrote in her
petition. "But singles' residences
should stay open" because they
are the permanent homes of most
graduate students.
Mike Choy, a third-year
student in applied physics, is
circulating a supporting petition
among married students in
Blackwelder.
Choy said that most singles
who have to stay are afraid of not
having kitchen facilities if they are
relocated in dormitories. "It's
more expensive to eat out for two
weeks," he noted.
In Court, a
singles-only residence, students
were concerned about security for
their apartments and their
belongings.
"The only decent security is
the fact that people are around,"
one disgruntled student said.
Cyndy Stratton, a first-year
business student, is organizing the
protest in Hulme Court, the only
other singles-only residence in
Escondido Village.
Stratton told the Daily that
residents were angry about
anticipated cooking and moving
expenses if Hulme should close.
She too added that it was
unfair for singles to be asked to
leave but not married students,
especially because singles pay
more for their apartments.

Student Residences Manager
Alan Cummings said that closing
the residence halls is part of a
campus-wide goal of reducing
energy.
Cummings said that he did not
know which residence halls would
close until he knew how many
residents were staying through the
quarter break and what other
housing would be available.
Students who want to stay are
required to state their reasons on
an application which must be
completed and turned into the
Mirrielees office before Nov. 29.
In determining who will be
permitted to stay, Cummings said
that his office is trying to
differentiate among students who
must remain and those who are
using University residences "as a
convenience factor."
"There are no tight
guidelines," Cummings said, but
he cited dissertations, incompletes
and academic or work
commitments as "kinds of
examples" of acceptable reasons.
He said that there will be
"reasonable efforts to provide
security for people whose rooms
will be used."
Married students and their
families were not directed to
vacate their Escondido
apartments, Cummings said,
because "this is their home living
unit as opposed to secondary
living quarters."

one disgruntled student said.
Cyndy Stratton, a first-year
business student, is organizing the
protest in Hulme Court, the only
other singles-only residence in
Escondido Village.
Stratton told the Daily that
residents were angry about
anticipated cooking and moving
expenses if Hulme should close.
She too added that it was
unfair for singles to be asked to
leave but not married students,
especially because singles pay
more for their apartments.

Student Residences Manager
Alan Cummings said that closing
the residence halls is part of a
campus-wide goal of reducing
energy.
Cummings said that he did not
know which residence halls would
close until he knew how many
residents were staying through the
quarter break and what other
housing would be available.
Students who want to stay are
required to state their reasons on
an application which must be
completed and turned into the
Mirrielees office before Nov. 29.
In determining who will be
permitted to stay, Cummings said
that his office is trying to
differentiate among students who
must remain and those who are
using University residences "as a
convenience factor."
"There are no tight
guidelines," Cummings said, but
he cited dissertations, incompletes
and academic or work
commitments as "kinds of
examples" of acceptable reasons.
He said that there will be
"reasonable efforts to provide
security for people whose rooms
will be used."
Married students and their
families were not directed to
vacate their Escondido
apartments, Cummings said,
because "this is their home living
unit as opposed to secondary
living quarters."

BLACKS IN CALIFORNIA — Author Anne Loftis addressed a group
of students yesterday in a series on Black Americans. With Ms. Loftis
spoke Dan Wilks, director of Nairobi High School in East Palo Alto.
Single graduate students in
Escondido Village are protesting
the decision of University housing
officials to close and lock their
residences during the Christmas
break.
Housing officials have directed
them to vacate their apartments
during the quarter break, unless
they have a "compelling reason"
to remain on campus, in an effort
to conserve energy.
Those students who must stay
on campus will be placed in
special housing, as yet
undesignated, and will probably
not have access to their
apartments.
Within 24 hours of receiving
announcements of the shut down
last Saturday night, petitions
against the University decision
were being circulated in three of
the four Escondido complexes
where single graduate students are
housed.
Although the protests are not
coordinated among the three
complexes, initiators of the
petitions cite the same grievances.
All expressed fears about security,
loss of kitchen privileges, and
disruption of studies.
Emily Bassman, a graduate
student in psychology who drew
up the petition in Blackwelder
Court, complained that the
closing discriminated against
singles, since married couples were
not asked to leave.
"Residents appreciate the

University's concern over the
energy crisis and the closing of
undergraduate dormitories since
the undergraduates usually go
home," Bassman wrote in her
petition. "But singles' residences
should stay open" because they
are the permanent homes of most
graduate students.
Mike Choy, a third-year
student in applied physics, is
circulating a supporting petition
among married students in
Blackwelder.
Choy said that most singles
who have to stay are afraid of not
having kitchen facilities if they are
relocated in dormitories. "It's
more expensive to eat out for two
weeks," he noted.
In Court, a
singles-only residence, students
were concerned about security for
their apartments and their
belongings.
"The only decent security is
the fact that people are around,"
one disgruntled student said.
