"Watts may have marked the
beginning of a movement by black
people away from integration and
towards an expression of their
own culture," said author Anne
Loftis yesterday afternoon at
Bechtel International Center.
In the last of four talks on
"California history from a
socio-ethnic perspective," she
addressed about 20 people on
"Black Americans," suggesting a
possible connection between the
violent riots in 1964 and the
passing of Proposition 14 not
quite a year earlier.
Loftis then introduced Dan
Wilks, director of Nairobi High
School in East Palo Alto, who
discussed the education of blacks
in California and answered
questions from the audience.
Loftis is the author of
California â€” Where the Twain Did
Meet, a description of minorities
in California history, and
co-author of The Great Betrayal,
an analysis of the evacuation of
Japanese-Americans during World
War 11.
"The historical role of black
and white confrontations in
California has not been as
controversial or dramatic as that
of Indians, chicanos, or Asians,"
she said.
She described a number of

black political figures in the
history of California, including
Pio Pico, the last governor of
Mexico under the Spanish regime,
and Jacob Dodson, a hero of the
Fremont expedition.
Blacks in California organized
early. The high black populations
of San Francisco, Sacramento,
and Stockton formed the
Franchise League to fight for civil
rights. They had a law repealed in
1863 which had prohibited blacks
from testifying against whites in
court. They were working for
suffrage in 1870 when a federal
law guaranteed ethnic groups all
over the country the vote.
Wilks described the Nairobi
School System, founded five years
ago by his mother Gertrude Wilks,
as "education for survival." The
private school for blacks has
about 110 students from
pre-school through high school.
Wilks compared Nairobi with
the Ravenswood system in East
Palo Alto, where black students
are bussed out and white students
are bussed in. While the public
school teaches classes designed to
broaden the students' education,
Nairobi concentrates on academic
skills. "Our students need these
basic skills, which they didn't get
at home because their parents
didn't have it to give them," said
Wilks.
