# Thirties Elegance, Subtle Wit Pervade 'Oh Coward!'
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
SAN FRANCISCO — "I came out humming the
tunes," read the posters and newspaper ads for
ACT's Oh Coward/, a revue of the words and music
of Noel Coward now playing at the Marines'
Memorial Theatre. The quote emanated, tongue in
cheek, from the master himself (Noel Coward, of
course) and although it is risking sacrilege to
disagree, I hereby do so (with tongue in cheek,
naturally).
One comes out of Oh Coward! oblivious to "the
tunes." They are memorable rarely, moving
sometimes, but engaging almost always. Rather, one
leaves the theatre thoroughly refreshed and
invigorated by Coward's abundant and resplendent
wit, which filled the house from the overture to the
final blackout.
Fellow countryman Roderick Cook devised and
directed the evening's entertainment, compiling bits
and pieces from various plays, musicals, and writings
of Coward. The result is a potpourri of deliciously
satirical songs and sketches, marvelous one liners,
moments of "articulate tenderness," and generally
jocund jocularity dealing with England, theatre,
love, women, and high society. The program has no
particular theme, other than Coward's mischievous,
irreverent, at times bawdy, and always entertaining
cleverness, and it needs none — it flows from
beginning to end.
Joining Cook on stage were Charlotte Fiarchild
and David Holliday, two American journeyman
thespians. The trio was consistently polished,
precise, and preeminently professional, providing a
sparkle and crispness that complemented the
material. They balanced the frolicking, frivolous
moments with a tender sensitivity in the reflective
serious phrases and the love ballads. The crisp quips
and the snappy songs crackled with impeccable
timing.

Ultimately, the evening belonged to Cook.
Surrounded by competence, he displayed the
absolute quintessence of comic delivery. His timing
was simply superb, his facial and bodily expressions
subtle and perfect. Time and again he turned a
pleasantly humorous line into a hilarious one.
The highlight of the program was his hungover
reminiscence of "a marvelous party." Bloody Mary
in hand, he painfully and bitingly recollected the
outrageous events of the night before with a
consummate subtlety that none but the British can
even approach. His performance, in short, was a
work of art in itself.
Oh Coward! has come to San Francisco form
New York and Montreal, riding the crest of the
wave of nostalgia that is sweeping the country (and
London). Opening night at the Marines was a gala
affair that would make even Mr. Coward pleased.
The entrance to the theatre was lined with lights
and ushers in top hats and tails to recreate the
splendiferous opening night atmosphere of the
Thirties. (The ushers, incidentally, coild not pull it
off — once a critic, always a critic.)
The audience was even more in the spirit of
things: ladies with feather "boas," tight hats,
sequined dresses, short raccoon coats; gentlemen in
top hats, tails, tuxedos, argyle sweaters and bow
ties; and of course, lots of basic elegant black. A
jaunt to a nearby pub for a gin and tonic (what else?
We were doing up the evening properly British)
revealed more of the theatre crowd with the perfect
Coward touch: six inch cigarette holders.
Reminiscense of England and the exciting hoopla
of opening night aside, Oh Coward! can stand on its
wit alone. It is not necessary to be a Noel Coward
buff to enjoy Cook's revue. Any patron of sparkling
good wit can enter this theatre cold, with no
background on Coward, even without having had a
gin and tonic, and after two hours emerge a Noel
Coward buff.

thespians. The trio was consistently polished,
precise, and preeminently professional, providing a
sparkle and crispness that complemented the
material. They balanced the frolicking, frivolous
moments with a tender sensitivity in the reflective
serious phrases and the love ballads. The crisp quips
and the snappy songs crackled with impeccable
timing.

Ultimately, the evening belonged to Cook.
Surrounded by competence, he displayed the
absolute quintessence of comic delivery. His timing
was simply superb, his facial and bodily expressions
subtle and perfect. Time and again he turned a
pleasantly humorous line into a hilarious one.
The highlight of the program was his hungover
reminiscence of "a marvelous party." Bloody Mary
in hand, he painfully and bitingly recollected the
outrageous events of the night before with a
consummate subtlety that none but the British can
even approach. His performance, in short, was a
work of art in itself.
Oh Coward! has come to San Francisco form
New York and Montreal, riding the crest of the
wave of nostalgia that is sweeping the country (and
London). Opening night at the Marines was a gala
affair that would make even Mr. Coward pleased.
The entrance to the theatre was lined with lights
and ushers in top hats and tails to recreate the
splendiferous opening night atmosphere of the
Thirties. (The ushers, incidentally, coild not pull it
off — once a critic, always a critic.)
The audience was even more in the spirit of
things: ladies with feather "boas," tight hats,
sequined dresses, short raccoon coats; gentlemen in
top hats, tails, tuxedos, argyle sweaters and bow
ties; and of course, lots of basic elegant black. A
jaunt to a nearby pub for a gin and tonic (what else?
We were doing up the evening properly British)
revealed more of the theatre crowd with the perfect
Coward touch: six inch cigarette holders.
Reminiscense of England and the exciting hoopla
of opening night aside, Oh Coward! can stand on its
wit alone. It is not necessary to be a Noel Coward
buff to enjoy Cook's revue. Any patron of sparkling
good wit can enter this theatre cold, with no
background on Coward, even without having had a
gin and tonic, and after two hours emerge a Noel
Coward buff.

REVUE -"I've been to a mahvelous pahty!" sings Roderick Cook in
Oh Coward/, a musical revue collecting songs and sketches by the late
Noel Coward. The show, produced by ACT, is running at the Marines'
Memorial Theatre in San Francisco.

SAN FRANCISCO — "I came out humming the
tunes," read the posters and newspaper ads for
ACT's Oh Coward/, a revue of the words and music
of Noel Coward now playing at the Marines'
Memorial Theatre. The quote emanated, tongue in
cheek, from the master himself (Noel Coward, of
course) and although it is risking sacrilege to
disagree, I hereby do so (with tongue in cheek,
naturally).
One comes out of Oh Coward! oblivious to "the
tunes." They are memorable rarely, moving
sometimes, but engaging almost always. Rather, one
leaves the theatre thoroughly refreshed and
invigorated by Coward's abundant and resplendent
wit, which filled the house from the overture to the
final blackout.
Fellow countryman Roderick Cook devised and
directed the evening's entertainment, compiling bits
and pieces from various plays, musicals, and writings
of Coward. The result is a potpourri of deliciously
satirical songs and sketches, marvelous one liners,
moments of "articulate tenderness," and generally
jocund jocularity dealing with England, theatre,
love, women, and high society. The program has no
particular theme, other than Coward's mischievous,
irreverent, at times bawdy, and always entertaining
cleverness, and it needs none — it flows from
beginning to end.
Joining Cook on stage were Charlotte Fiarchild
and David Holliday, two American journeyman
thespians. The trio was consistently polished,
precise, and preeminently professional, providing a
sparkle and crispness that complemented the
material. They balanced the frolicking, frivolous
moments with a tender sensitivity in the reflective
serious phrases and the love ballads. The crisp quips
