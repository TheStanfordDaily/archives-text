# Peter Without Paul & Mary
## Good Group Backs Ex-Folkie Yarrow 
### PAUL BREWBAKER 
SAN FRANCISCO - Peter,
Paul, and Mary's decade together
will remain in the annals of rock
history as one of the most creative
and influential of any group's
record. But as George Harrison
reflectively sung after the "They'll
Never Break Up" Beatles passed
on, all things must pass.
Each of the separate Beatles
has of course made good on his
own, and apparently likewise will
be the case of at least one third of
that other famous group.
Recently, in a six-day engagement
at the Boarding House, Peter
Yarrow excited die-hard fans with
a new band and new material,
including several reggae numbers.
The former folk star, conjuring up
remembrances that indeed, the
times they are a 'changing, has
embraced an electric sound with
great confidence and ease as his
impressive performance testified.
Rolling Stone quotes Yarrow
as saying, "My 36 gold records
don't mean anything here. Only
my relationship with the audience
counts." It was an enthusiastic
audience opening night which
called back Yarrow and his group
for an encore of "Puff the Magic
Dragon," as the nicknamed
"Yarrowettes" convinced at least
a few buyers of his latest LP's
worth.
Backed by a primo drummer,
electric bassist, guitarist, and (take
note) David Scat, keyboardist
extraordinaire, Peter Yarrow came
out and with a warm hello
introduced them as "not just
Peter Yarrow, but the Peter
Yarrow Group." It was a very
together sound which emanated
form onstage, with even the
mellower sounds crescendoing to
sometimes stomping finishes.
With his "college boy" vocals
as fresh as ever, the balding
Yarrow has a sound which could
easily be sold — or sold out. His
strength is still in the lyrics, with
the same subtle social comments
as before, but there pervaded an
uneasy sense of commercialism
throughout.

Another addition to Yarrow's
expanded repertoire were several
reggae tunes. A far step from the
calypso PP&M great "Lemon
Tree," as Yarrow reggae is almost
as full-blown as Johnny Nash's.
While playing acoustic backup
guitar all night, Yarrow's lead
guitarist handled a few Dickie
Betts play-alike slide guitar licks,
as well as powerful just plain rock
'n' roll fret frazzlin'. A very
spacy-looking bass player,
contrasting Yarrow's still
"intellectual" look, provided
competent bottom all night. But
it was David Scat who almost
stole the show, if not dominating
too much at times, switching
between a grand piano and
mini-moog to get a range of
sounds from honky-tonk to
violins.
After opening with several rock
numbers. Yarrow played an old
time swing song, with the
audience clapping along. As seems
to be popular nowadays, the
group did their version of a fifties
love tune: "doo-wad-doo-doo/
doooooo-dwit-dwit/doo-wad-doo
doo/doooooo-dwit-dwit. .
complete with a rock-bottom bass
line and screeching falsetto tenor.
Still Political
Yarrow's group left him
momentarily and he played a
couple of Jimmy Cliff numbers of
old. It was an intense solo of the
PP&M hit "The Great Mandella"
(The Wheel of Life) that moved
the crowd the most, clearly
demonstrating that Peter has not

entirely left the political forum to
make more bucks. The words
were a little updated, but the
message was still there.
Surprising all, Yarrow and
group did a fantastic job playing
some of them down-home blues,
with the lead guitarist grinding
out some great whining solos, and
Scat gettin' down on some
excellent piano riffs.
As an encore, "Puff the Magic
Dragon" was the perfect choice,
and perfectly played. Peter took
time out to explain that his song
was not an never had been a dope
song ("Puff the Magic Dragon:
smoke dope, right? or Lived by the
Sea: for .. . Coke, dig?").
There certainly was more to his
words — Yarrow has written
seriously, and he has written at
times whimsically. Now there is a

new dimension to his music, as he
has encompassed a new breadth of
musical styles to get his messages
across.
Playing warmup was an
all-female group from Sausalito
called Ascension, hitting it off
with "Across the Great Divide"
and plowing through similar
country-rock tunes. The crowd
got off on watching the four
women playing and singing, and
just looking like they were having
fun doing it. Ascension closed
with a little bit of funk "Ya
know, I'm funky/ but I'm clean/
If you know what I mean.. ." and
then a hot little untitled blues
number with the anonymous lead
guitarist ripping off riffs from an
Albert King alburm and generally
doing quite well. A pleasant
diversion but not at all engaging.
