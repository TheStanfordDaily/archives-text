# Brubeck-And-Sons Concert Proves Talent Doesn't Run In The Family
## 
### DAN FORTE 
OAKLAND â€” "Two Generations of Brubeck,"
presented at the Paramount Theater Sunday night,
proved all too clearly that talent is not hereditary,
at least not in all cases.
Dave Brubeck has long been recognized as one of
the leading innovators in modern jazz through his
work with the Dave Brubeck Quartet.
The Quartet, which featured alto saxophonist
Paul Desmond, was famous for its experiments with
new time signatures, getting away from the usual
4/4.
Brubeck is a fine pianist, besides being a prolific
composer and arranger.
Of his three sons, only Danny, the youngest,
seems to have received any musical inheritance. He
is an excellent drummer, able to handle any and all
of Brubeck's tricky time signatures with ease.
Mediocre, Sloppy
The other two sons, Darius (keyboards) and
Chris (bass and trombone), were mediocre at best,
and more often quite sloppy.
The show began with the four Brubecks playing
new arrangements of some of Brubeck's earlier
works, starting with "Three to Get Ready" (in 3/4
time), and "Unsquare Dance" (in 7/4).
Darius' electric piano work seemed very
unimaginative when audible. Chris' electric bass
playing was, for the most part, rather elementary. .

Following an intermission, the DArius Brubeck
Ensemble took over, with Chris switching to
trombone, being replaced by Dave Powell on bass.
The group included Harry Robinson (clarinet),
George Begonzi (tenor sax), and Peter Ruth, a
terrible harmonica player.
The material, composed by Darius, and the
playing were pure trash, senseless and repetitious.
Most of the songs were an attempt at mixing
jazz, blues, rock, and soul, with the result being
mud.
"The Secret" consisted mostly of sound effects
produced in a variety of ways, such as Peter
"Madman" Ruth on Jew's harp. His Jew's harp
playing was downright antisemitic.
Miserable 'Take Five'
Dave Brubeck joined the group for their finale,
ending with his most famous work, "Take Five,"
which was probably the worst rendition of the song
Brubeck has ever played, thanks to the Ensemble.
The group received a standing ovation, mostly
out of respect for Brubeck, and returned for an
encore.
Hopefully, Dave Brubeck will soon form another
quartet with competent jazz men, leaving the Darius
Brubeck Ensemble to practice for another twenty or
so years. They're not worthy of their father's name,
which is the only reason they are getting any
bookings.
