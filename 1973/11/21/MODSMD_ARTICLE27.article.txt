# Brilliant 'La Boheme' Ends Season
## 
### JIM CAMERON 
SAN FRANCISCO - The
audience awaited with
apprehension the return of
Puccini's every-popular La
Boheme to the Opera House stage.
Anxieties seemed to center on the
unusual youthfulness of the cast
— led by a 25-year-old Spaniard in
the opera's great tenor role —
which General Director Kurt
Herbert Adler had assembled for
this season's final production.
All apprehensions, however,
dissipated within moments of the
opening curtain when the
production premiered last week.
The brilliant young performers,
under the superb direction of
Ghita Hager, staged the greatest
coup of this operatic season, and
the 25-year-old tenor from
Catalonia, Jose Carreras, emerged
unchallenged as San Francisco's
new musical hero. To put it
mildly, this Boheme is a smashing
success.

Traditionally, the opera
belongs to the consumptive
heroine, Mimi, whose suffering
sends the audience reaching for its
handkerchiefs. In this production,
though, the dashing young
Carreras succeeds in proving, as
few great tenors ever have, that,
after all, the audience's
sympathies really belong with
Rodolfo.
Carreras achieves this with an
endless stream of tender, sweet
and luscious tone. The voice, one
of the most beautiful to come to
San Francisco this year, balances
strength in all ranges with
unsurpassed, velvety expression,
and floats effortlessly into the
celestial reaches of this demanding
role. Carreras sings with beauty
and grace at every dynamic, from
the softest, sweetest pianissimos
to the most ardent and full-bodied
fortes of passion.

Brilliant Actor, Too

As if this were not enough,
Carreras combines his glorious
tenor with sincere and convincing
dramatic expression. This Rodolfo
really does love Mimi — the
embraces are passionate, the joys
and tears genuine. On Friday
night the audience acknowledged
this exceptional performance with
bravos, flowers, and a standing
ovation at the final curtain. Few
performers achieve such brilliance
even at the peak of their careers —
how fortunate that we shall be
able to enjoy this talent for many
years to come.
This Boheme succeeds so
admirably, though, because of its
uniformity of excellence. The
performances of virtually all the
players, even if they do not match
the sheer genius of Carreras'
Rodolfo, compete favorably with
any renderings in opera today.
The members of the cast all blend
fine musical portrayals with
sparkling (and very funny)
comedy and profound, sensitive
drama.
This year's heroine is Canadian
soprano Teresa Stratas. A lovelier
Mimi one would be hard put to
find. She does not command the
magical vocal gifts of her romantic
partner. She triumphs, however,
because she utilizes her still
considerable talents to full
advantage.
Fluid, Smooth Soprano
While her voice is somewhat
open in its upper reaches, it does
have a fine, satiny texture in the
middle range. Stratas caresses the
Puccinian phrases with the
fluidity and smoothness so
necessary to this role.
Here again, an impressive talent
complements a lovely voice.
Stratas occasionally indulged in
overstatement during the early
moments of her performance, but

she soon refined her dramatic
portrayal to near perfection.
Whatever passion Carreras
extended to her, she returned. Her
consumption was absolutely
believable. Stratas' performance,
especially in the third and fourth
acts, was a model of grace.
When the two lovers met,
passion flowed. There was nothing
stagy or contrived about their
affection: the sincerity of their
portrayals brought tears to many
eyes. When, during curtain calls,
Carreras and Stratas embraced,
one sensed profound respect and
camaraderie.
Pervasive Enthusiasm
What makes this production
special is the warmth and
enthusiasm which pervades the

entire cast. These players
obviously enjoy working together;
this greatly enhances the
individual performances and,
more importantly, infuses the
entire production with energy and
harmony.
Director Hager certainly
deserves much of the credit for
this inspiration. She allows her
singers to laugh and play, but
without the slightest detriment to
the musical product. The first
and fourth-act garret scenes were
seasoned with clever and polished
comedy; this was particularly
effective in the final act, when the
hilarity of the first half contrasted
strikingly with the grief and
passion of the closing moments.
Hager showed remarkable genius

in her staging of the Act II cafe
scene, where the crowds surged
with color and spirit.
Hager is fortunate to have the
still beautiful sets and costumes of
the 1956 production. All
components blend to evoke the
harshness, intrigue and gaiety that
distinguish the Latin Quarter.
This, then, is a Boheme which
no music lover will want to miss.
The superb dramatic and vocal
portrayals — and especially that of
Senor Carreras — guarantee that
San Francisco will remember this
production of this favorite of all
operas for many, many seasons.
Two performances remain —
tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m.

to the most ardent and full-bodied
fortes of passion.

Brilliant Actor, Too

As if this were not enough,
Carreras combines his glorious
tenor with sincere and convincing
dramatic expression. This Rodolfo
really does love Mimi — the
embraces are passionate, the joys
and tears genuine. On Friday
night the audience acknowledged
this exceptional performance with
bravos, flowers, and a standing
ovation at the final curtain. Few
performers achieve such brilliance
even at the peak of their careers —
how fortunate that we shall be
able to enjoy this talent for many
years to come.
This Boheme succeeds so
admirably, though, because of its
uniformity of excellence. The
performances of virtually all the
players, even if they do not match
the sheer genius of Carreras'
Rodolfo, compete favorably with
any renderings in opera today.
The members of the cast all blend
fine musical portrayals with
sparkling (and very funny)
comedy and profound, sensitive
drama.
This year's heroine is Canadian
soprano Teresa Stratas. A lovelier
Mimi one would be hard put to
find. She does not command the
magical vocal gifts of her romantic
partner. She triumphs, however,
because she utilizes her still
considerable talents to full
advantage.
Fluid, Smooth Soprano
While her voice is somewhat
open in its upper reaches, it does
have a fine, satiny texture in the
middle range. Stratas caresses the
Puccinian phrases with the
fluidity and smoothness so
necessary to this role.
Here again, an impressive talent
complements a lovely voice.
Stratas occasionally indulged in
overstatement during the early
moments of her performance, but

she soon refined her dramatic
portrayal to near perfection.
Whatever passion Carreras
extended to her, she returned. Her
consumption was absolutely
believable. Stratas' performance,
especially in the third and fourth
acts, was a model of grace.
When the two lovers met,
passion flowed. There was nothing
stagy or contrived about their
affection: the sincerity of their
portrayals brought tears to many
eyes. When, during curtain calls,
Carreras and Stratas embraced,
one sensed profound respect and
camaraderie.
Pervasive Enthusiasm
What makes this production
special is the warmth and
enthusiasm which pervades the

entire cast. These players
obviously enjoy working together;
this greatly enhances the
individual performances and,
more importantly, infuses the
entire production with energy and
harmony.
Director Hager certainly
deserves much of the credit for
this inspiration. She allows her
singers to laugh and play, but
without the slightest detriment to
the musical product. The first
and fourth-act garret scenes were
seasoned with clever and polished
comedy; this was particularly
effective in the final act, when the
hilarity of the first half contrasted
strikingly with the grief and
passion of the closing moments.
Hager showed remarkable genius

in her staging of the Act II cafe
scene, where the crowds surged
with color and spirit.
Hager is fortunate to have the
still beautiful sets and costumes of
the 1956 production. All
components blend to evoke the
harshness, intrigue and gaiety that
distinguish the Latin Quarter.
This, then, is a Boheme which
no music lover will want to miss.
The superb dramatic and vocal
portrayals — and especially that of
Senor Carreras — guarantee that
San Francisco will remember this
production of this favorite of all
operas for many, many seasons.
Two performances remain —
tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m.

SAN FRANCISCO - The
audience awaited with
apprehension the return of
Puccini's every-popular La
Boheme to the Opera House stage.
Anxieties seemed to center on the
unusual youthfulness of the cast
— led by a 25-year-old Spaniard in
the opera's great tenor role —
which General Director Kurt
Herbert Adler had assembled for
this season's final production.
All apprehensions, however,
dissipated within moments of the
opening curtain when the
production premiered last week.
The brilliant young performers,
under the superb direction of
Ghita Hager, staged the greatest
coup of this operatic season, and
the 25-year-old tenor from
Catalonia, Jose Carreras, emerged
unchallenged as San Francisco's
new musical hero. To put it
mildly, this Boheme is a smashing
success.

Traditionally, the opera
belongs to the consumptive
heroine, Mimi, whose suffering
sends the audience reaching for its
handkerchiefs. In this production,
though, the dashing young
Carreras succeeds in proving, as
few great tenors ever have, that,
after all, the audience's
sympathies really belong with
Rodolfo.
Carreras achieves this with an
endless stream of tender, sweet
and luscious tone. The voice, one
of the most beautiful to come to
San Francisco this year, balances
strength in all ranges with
unsurpassed, velvety expression,
and floats effortlessly into the
celestial reaches of this demanding
role. Carreras sings with beauty
and grace at every dynamic, from
the softest, sweetest pianissimos
to the most ardent and full-bodied
fortes of passion.

overstatement during the early
moments of her performance, but

she soon refined her dramatic
portrayal to near perfection.
Whatever passion Carreras
extended to her, she returned. Her
consumption was absolutely
believable. Stratas' performance,
especially in the third and fourth
acts, was a model of grace.
When the two lovers met,
passion flowed. There was nothing
stagy or contrived about their
affection: the sincerity of their
portrayals brought tears to many
eyes. When, during curtain calls,
Carreras and Stratas embraced,
one sensed profound respect and
camaraderie.
Pervasive Enthusiasm
What makes this production
special is the warmth and
enthusiasm which pervades the

entire cast. These players
obviously enjoy working together;
this greatly enhances the
individual performances and,
more importantly, infuses the
entire production with energy and
harmony.
Director Hager certainly
deserves much of the credit for
this inspiration. She allows her
singers to laugh and play, but
without the slightest detriment to
the musical product. The first
and fourth-act garret scenes were
seasoned with clever and polished
comedy; this was particularly
effective in the final act, when the
hilarity of the first half contrasted
strikingly with the grief and
passion of the closing moments.
Hager showed remarkable genius

in her staging of the Act II cafe
scene, where the crowds surged
with color and spirit.
Hager is fortunate to have the
still beautiful sets and costumes of
the 1956 production. All
components blend to evoke the
harshness, intrigue and gaiety that
distinguish the Latin Quarter.
This, then, is a Boheme which
no music lover will want to miss.
The superb dramatic and vocal
portrayals — and especially that of
Senor Carreras — guarantee that
San Francisco will remember this
production of this favorite of all
operas for many, many seasons.
Two performances remain —
tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m.

SAN FRANCISCO - The
audience awaited with
apprehension the return of
Puccini's every-popular La
Boheme to the Opera House stage.
Anxieties seemed to center on the
unusual youthfulness of the cast
— led by a 25-year-old Spaniard in
the opera's great tenor role —
which General Director Kurt
Herbert Adler had assembled for
this season's final production.
All apprehensions, however,
dissipated within moments of the
opening curtain when the
production premiered last week.
The brilliant young performers,
under the superb direction of
Ghita Hager, staged the greatest
coup of this operatic season, and
the 25-year-old tenor from
Catalonia, Jose Carreras, emerged
unchallenged as San Francisco's
new musical hero. To put it
mildly, this Boheme is a smashing
success.

Traditionally, the opera
belongs to the consumptive
heroine, Mimi, whose suffering
sends the audience reaching for its
handkerchiefs. In this production,
though, the dashing young
Carreras succeeds in proving, as
few great tenors ever have, that,
after all, the audience's
sympathies really belong with
Rodolfo.
Carreras achieves this with an
endless stream of tender, sweet
and luscious tone. The voice, one
of the most beautiful to come to
San Francisco this year, balances
strength in all ranges with
unsurpassed, velvety expression,
and floats effortlessly into the
celestial reaches of this demanding
role. Carreras sings with beauty
and grace at every dynamic, from
the softest, sweetest pianissimos
to the most ardent and full-bodied
fortes of passion.

Brilliant Actor, Too

As if this were not enough,
Carreras combines his glorious
tenor with sincere and convincing
dramatic expression. This Rodolfo
really does love Mimi — the
embraces are passionate, the joys
and tears genuine. On Friday
night the audience acknowledged
this exceptional performance with
bravos, flowers, and a standing
ovation at the final curtain. Few
performers achieve such brilliance
even at the peak of their careers —
how fortunate that we shall be
able to enjoy this talent for many
years to come.
This Boheme succeeds so
admirably, though, because of its
uniformity of excellence. The
performances of virtually all the
players, even if they do not match
the sheer genius of Carreras'
Rodolfo, compete favorably with
any renderings in opera today.
The members of the cast all blend
fine musical portrayals with
sparkling (and very funny)
comedy and profound, sensitive
drama.
This year's heroine is Canadian
soprano Teresa Stratas. A lovelier
Mimi one would be hard put to
find. She does not command the
magical vocal gifts of her romantic
partner. She triumphs, however,
because she utilizes her still
considerable talents to full
advantage.
Fluid, Smooth Soprano
While her voice is somewhat
open in its upper reaches, it does
have a fine, satiny texture in the
middle range. Stratas caresses the
Puccinian phrases with the
fluidity and smoothness so
necessary to this role.
Here again, an impressive talent
complements a lovely voice.
Stratas occasionally indulged in
overstatement during the early
moments of her performance, but

she soon refined her dramatic
portrayal to near perfection.
Whatever passion Carreras
extended to her, she returned. Her
consumption was absolutely
believable. Stratas' performance,
especially in the third and fourth
acts, was a model of grace.
