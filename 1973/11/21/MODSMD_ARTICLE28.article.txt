# Actor Portrays Cervantes
## 
### 
Richard Kiley, star of the
original Broadway production
of Man of La Mancha, will
head the cast of Cervantes at 8
p.m. tonight in Memorial
Auditorium.
Written by Norman Corwin,
Cervantes is a new approach to
one of the most colorful of
history's undisputed genises.
Although many theatrical
works have been built around
Cervantes' immortal Don
Quixote, none have dealt
primarily with the life of the
writer.
For the first time Cervantes
is seen in various stages of his
own checkered career. Corwin
has done extensive research on
this script; very little
information was available
about this so-called mediocre
poet and minor playwright
until his novel burst upon the
otherwise dull 17th century
scene.
