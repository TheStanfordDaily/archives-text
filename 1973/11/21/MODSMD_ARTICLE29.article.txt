# 1970s Beach Boys Can't Escape Sun-And-Surf Sounds Of 1960s
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
SAN FRANCISCO - Just as
Richard Nixon is unable to escape
the image of his checkered past,
so the Beach Boys can't get away
from the sun and surf imagery
that made them forces on the
entertainment scene in the early
19605.
The sellout crowd at
Winterland Saturday night was
there for one thing â€” to see the
Beach Boys perform the songs of
the 60s that made them famous.
The audience did call back
Commander Cody for one encore,
and listened politely to some
heavy-metal throwback called
Three-Man Army, but its heart
belonged to the Beach Boys.
With two drummers and still
another person on congas, and at
times as many as four electric
pianos and organs playing, the
musical makeup wasn't the same
as it was 10 years ago. Nor was
half of the material, taken from
the Pet Sounds through the most
recent Holland albums. Those
numbers always received warm
applause, but the frenzied
reaction was saved for the songs
of the 1962-66 period.
When the band hit the first
notes of "Surfin' U.5.A.," the
whole audience erupted in a
scream of pure, joyous delight.
The Beach Boys demonstrated
that no one does their old songs
better than they do with a tasteful
blending of voices on "Little
Surfer Girl." It sounded just as
sweet and innocent as it did ten
years ago.

"California Girls," "Help Me,
Rhonda," "I Get Around," and
others were lost in the incredible
euphoria that swept through the
audience after the first few notes
of any mid-60s hit. By the time
the Beach Boys got to "Barbara
Ann," people were singing,
clapping, standing and shrieking in
a delirium of nostalgia and good
vibrations (yes, they did that one,
too).
But it's not fair to ignore
Commander Cody and his Lost
Planet Airmen, whose tight,
showy set preceded the Beach
Boys. The Commander and
company were in their best
country rock form, but a Beach
Boys audience just wasn't able to
react with unbridled enthusiasm
to "Mama Hated Diesels." They
did respond, though, to
"Jailhouse Rock," and other
tunes that were simple and
danceable.
The Commander himself got
the most applause with an
amazingly sprightly version of
"Hot Rod Lincoln," which he
must have done verywhere by

now, and followed that up with a
raspy rendition of "There's a Riot
Goin' On."
Commander Cody ended his
hour on stage with "Lost In the
Ozone," from the albrum of the
same name, and it wasn't long
until the whole audience was lost
in the ozone of the simpelr early
19605. But the Beach Boys
showed their awareness of other
group's important work by ending
their encore with "Jumping Jack
Flash." If the Rolling Stones
themselves had been performing,
the audience couldn't have been
more frenzied.
Even with that bow to the
present, the Beach Boys cannot
burst free from the world of the
early 60s, that they encompassed
so simply and succintly with their
songs of sun and surf,
well-endowed cars and girls.
For their accomplishments in
that world, the Beach Boys still
have a well-earned place at the top
of today's music scene, even
though they have had no big hits
in the 70s. For the Beach Boys
and their fans, there will always
be Surf City.
