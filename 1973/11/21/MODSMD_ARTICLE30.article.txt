# 'Verbal Cinematography' Provides Cosby's Comedy

SAN CARLOS — "You catch the fluidity which is human life and
you focus a light on it and you stop it long enough for people to be
able to see it." William Faulkner's comment about his own writing is
not as far removed from Bill Cosby's brand of humor as one might
initially think. In his performances last weekend at the Circle Star
Theater, Cosby illuminated the range of everyday comic experience
through the use of just such a verbal cinematography as Faulkner is
defining.
Like Faulkner, Cosby is a story-teller whose gifts of perception and
timing have been employed to evoke a specific background that
functions as a tool toward a more universal understanding. For
Faulkner, the literary setting is a mythical section of Mississippi while
Cosby bases many of his comic routines in the Philadelphia ghetto in
which he was raised.
Just as Faulkner's territory is peopled with a long line of Sutpens,
Compsons and Snopses, so Cosby's home town has sired such
mythological characters as Fat Albert, Weasel, and Wierd Harold. It is
what Eudora Welty has called the "sense of place" that is translated
into a more universal human awareness. As she herself puts it,"it is by
knowing where you stand that you grow able to judge where you
yy
are.
Perhaps humor is the most difficult form of story-telling to
adequately assess because the comedian involves, by nature, a kind of
total participation with his audience. Laughter is a creative, rather
than analytical, process in which the listener reaffirms a condition of
truth.
Comedy Through Realism
What makes Cosby an excellent humorist is his proximity to
realism — his ability, through personification and identification, to
caricature the self-image of his audience. By detailing his own
childhood and adult experiences, and translating them into the
common denominator of human experience through humor, Cosby
enables his audiences to laugh at their own absurdity.
As Cosby himself puts it, "in my monologues the humor itself goes
straight down the middle — identification. Then the overcurrent is the
fact that rather than trying to bring the races of people together by
talking about the similarities. Then there is the undercurrent that
appeals for an understanding of the gap beteen the ages."
Perhaps another comment by Faulkner is no less apt in defining his
own, as well as Cosby's, relation to the world of mythological realism
that he has created — "my people are no more real than the actual
world, but no less real." In the final analysis, the joke is on us all.
