# Wrestlers Set For Promising Season
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Wrestling coach Joe De Meo,
bubbling with enthusiasm as his
team prepares for its opening
meet Monday night, calls this
year's squad the "biggest and best
quality team Stanford has ever
put on the mat."
Besides returning 12 lettermen,
the squad will feature "our
greatest group of freshmen ever,"
according to De Meo. "Every one
of them is tough," he said of the
first-year men.
The team will be led by Chris
Horpel (150-pound class), who
has a lot to live up to after an
outstanding junior year.
Besides placing fifth in the
NCAA and second in the Pacific
Eight, he was named to the
Ail-American team and was voted
"California Wrestler of the Year"
and "Bay Area Wrestler of the
Year."
Ken Krebs (142) is a three-year
letterman and one of Stanford's
toughest wrestlers ever. He has
been a consistent winner for the
past two seasons and was one of
last year's co-captains.
Tri-Captains
Krebs, Horpel and junior
Emmett Stanton (158) were voted
tri-captains of this year's squad.
Last year, Stanton qualified for
the NCAA finals and was voted
Stanford's most improved
wrestler.
Two other standouts should be
Bob Sweetman (126) and John
Govea (190). Sweetman, although
blind, has had fine winning
seasons the last two years. Govea
was voted "Best Freshman" for
his winning performance on the
varsity last year.

De Meo is particularly happy
with three freshmen: Mark
Yancey (134), Craig Reynolds
(158) and Gary Anderson
(heavyweight). The heavyweight
class has three fine wrestlers,
according to De Meo. Art Estrada
and Kris Westersund will battle
Anderson for the spot, although
Westersund may go down to the
190 class.
Monday's season opener is a
triangular meet, with Sonoma
State and Sacramento State
providing the opposition. The
7:30 p.m. contest will be held at
Encina Gym.
Two More Tourneys
The wrestlers will compete in
separate tournaments the
following weekend, with six
competitors going with De Meo to
a big meet in Arizona. The rest of
the team will compete in the San
Jose State Invitational Meet.
The bulk of the Cards'
schedule is slated for next quarter.
The team competes in 14 dual
meets, two triangular meets and
two tournaments before the Pac-8
finals and the NCAA
championship in early March.
In a triangular meet, a wrestler
in each weight class opposes a
grappler from each of the other
schools. A team can have two
different members wrestle at each
class, so De Meo hopes to put
about 16-18 men in action
Monday.
The object in wrestling is for a
team to accumulate more points
than the opposition. In an
individual match, the winning
team is awarded six points for a
pin, four points for a superior
decision (a victory by more than
10 points), or three points for a
regular decision. If there is a draw,
each team gets two points.
Wrestling is a very popular
sport in certain areas of the
country. In Oklahoma, 11,000
people attended one dual match.
lowa State is the defending
NCAA champion, but should be
pressed by Pac-8 powers Oregon
State and Washington this year.
Last season, those two schools,
along with Oregon, UCLA and
Stanford, made their mark at the
NCAA finals.
