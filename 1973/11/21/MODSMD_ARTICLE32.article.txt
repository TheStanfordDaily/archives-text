# Sandoval Places 40th At NCAA's
## 
### 
Stanford sophomore Tony
Sandoval finished a disappointing
40th Monday in the NCAA Cross
Country championships at
Spokane, Wash.
Running in what coach
Marshall Clark called a "very
classy field" of 220 entrants,
Sandoval "didn't get up to the
front early enough," and thus
failed to break into the top 25,
which comprise the All-American
team.
Sandoval's time on the six-mile
course was 29:36.5.
Oregon's Steve Prefontaine
won his third individual title,
edging Englishman Nick Rose of
Western Kentucky with a 28:14.9
clocking. The Ducks easily won
the team title, with Texas-El Paso
second and host Washington State
third.
"40th sounds awful," Clark
said, "but Tony actually ran
pretty well. He would have loved
to be up a little closer early, but
it's a big field."
Clark said Sandoval "was very
strong late in the race and passed
several runners in the stretch."
