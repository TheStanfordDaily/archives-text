## Football Officials Far From Perfect 
### Don Tollefson 
Ten days ago as Stanford's bubble burst in
the fading sunlight of the LA Coliseum,
defensive tackle Joe Martin did what most
players dream of doing; he popped an official.
The angered Martin could've just as easily
"reased" a USC player, but he obviously felt
that the officials were more responsible for
Stanford's loss. He might have been right.
Ideally, pro football officials should be the
best their profession has to offer. The
officiating in some recent games indicates,
however, that some referees are falling far
short of perfection. People who defend
referees claim that they are perhaps guilty of
one bad call in 100, which only proves their
humanity. But unlike a criminal defendant, an
accused athlete has no recourse for a bad call;
officials are arresting officers, prosecutors and
judges all at once.
Last Sunday, Broadway Joe Namath
returned to the field against Cincinnati after
having been sidelined for most of the year
with a shoulder separation. Willie Joe came
awfully close to leading the Jets to a big upset
and winning another million dollars in
endorsements for himself. The Bengals
couldn't stop Namath in the closing seconds
of the game, but the officials did.
With less than a minute to play and the
Bengals leading 20-14, Namath moved the Jets
to the Cincinnati 11 yard line. On the first

play from there, Namath threw an apparent
touchdown pass to tight end Rich Caster, but
an official ruled that Caster came down out of
the end zone. Seconds later, Namath threw
again to Caster, who was hit at the goal line
and pushed back into the field of play. The
referees placed the ball inside the one yard
line and time ran out before the Jets could get
off another play.
Either play could have and probably
should have been ruled a touchdown. But in
each case, one man did what 11 BEngal
defenders couldn't. Anyone who saw
Saturday's Stan ford-Oregon game realizes that
the calls in the Jets game weren't the only
controversial end zone calls this weekend.
After that game, both coaches admitted that
the halftime score could just as easily have
been 0-0, instead of 7-7.
Referees are not computerized robots.
They will always made mistakes. But should
their mistakes be irrevocable? Last year the
Oakland Raiders were knocked out of the
playoffs because of an extremely controversial
call which allowed a miraculous Franco Harris
touchdown that carried the Pittsburgh
Steelers into the AFC finals.
What can be done? Some overzealous fans
have suggested that referees who make
mistakes should be drawn and quartered and
then buried under the end zone of the team

they wronged. Besides the obvious costs
involved in digging so many graves, this might
lead to a referees' strike that could cause
chaos in American households some Sunday.
One sports writer has suggested a system of
penalty points which would be awarded to
teams victimzied by officials' mistakes by
league officials who would review all game
films. The points would be used as a
tiebreaker if there was a tie at the end of the
season. But how does this help the team
which finishes one game out of first due to a
referee's call?
Perhaps the suggestion which deserves the
most serious study is the one advocating
regular use of video tape equipment to
arbitrate controversial calls. This technique
was used to decide on the Franco Harris
touchdown in that Steeler-Raider game and
although that call will still be debated for
years, this method of judgment was far
superior to having a season-ending call made
by a single official in the incredible emotion
of the moment.
Officials might feel that the use of such
equipment would be an infringement on their
territory. But until all officials realize they are
fallible and very capable of making mistakes,
we are still going to see a lot of bad calls. And
a lot of games will be won or lost because of
them.
