# Booters End Successful Season With 2-1 Defeat
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Playing without any hope of a
playoff berth, the Stanford soccer
team lost its final game of the
season to Westmont College
yesterday, 2-1, in Santa Barbara.
Westmont got its first score
when a Cardinal player, trying to
head the ball away from the goal,
miscalculated and knocked it into
the net. In the second half,
Westmont scored again on what
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle
called a "good shot."
Alan McDonald scored the lone
Card goal when he lofted a shot
past the Westmont netminder.
Priddle said the team played "a
very good game." He felt the team
over-reacted a little because they
wanted to win "so badly."
Last Friday it was announced
that Santa Clara would be the
fourth team in the West Coast
playoffs. USF, UCLA and

Washington were the other three
teams chosen. The Cards and San
Jose State had been considered
for the final spot.
Banner Year
Despite the fact the Cards did
not make the NCAA playoffs, it
was a banner year as their 10-5-2
record indicates. Much of the
success was due to senior goalie
Walt Harris. In 17 games he
allowed only 22 goals.
Harris was in goal for almost
the whole time in seven Cardinal
shutouts. Three times the
opposition was held to a single
score, six times he allowed only
two goals, and only once did he
allow more than two scores.
The offense, on the other
hand, was sporadic, despite
scoring 45 goals on the year. The
Cards were shutout only three
times, but were held to a single
score in seven games.

Stanford started the season
with an upset win over San Jose
State, 1-0. The booters recorded
their second straight shutout the
next week as they stomped
College of Notre Dame, 11-0.
Only Big Loss
The Cards next took on USF,
the top team on the coast, and fell
apart, 7-0, for their only big loss
of the season.
Their next three defeats were
at the hands of UC-Davis, UCLA
and Santa Clara by identical
scores of 2-1. In each of the three
games, Stanford's opponent
scored once on a penalty kick,
which provided the margin of
victory.
After falling to a 2-3 record
(the Santa Clara loss came later in
the season), the Cards won three
straight, including two 1-0
shutouts over Canada College and
Cal State-Chico. Their third win
was a 4-2 whipping of Menlo
college.
Following those wins and the
Santa Clara loss, the Cards
remained unbeaten for seven
games. First came three impressive
victories: a 6-2 conquest of the
Naval Post Graduate School, an
8-0 shutout of Cal
State-Humboldt, and a 3-1 defeat
of Cal State-San Francisco.
Scoreless Draws
In the next three contests, the
booters sandwiched a win
between two scoreless draws.
California and University of
Pacific provided the ties and Cal
State-Hayward suffered a 4-1
setback.
Last week, in a sloppy game,
the Cards nipped St. Patrick's 2-1,
which along with the Westmont
loss, brings the season to a close.
Brian Bershader was the
leading scorer for the Cards,
coming on strong toward the end
of the season with a total of nine
goals. Phil Wright had seven
scores. Bobby Geiger and Ricky
Caldwell, both who were out part
of the season, each had five
points.
Johnny Murao had four;
Robbie Robb and Tom Miller
scored three each. Mac Taylor and
Harris each had a pair, and Chico
De La Guardia, Jeff Hall, Grant
Heidrick, Alan Mc Donald and
Marty Glickfeld each put in one
shot.

Banner Year
Despite the fact the Cards did
not make the NCAA playoffs, it
was a banner year as their 10-5-2
record indicates. Much of the
success was due to senior goalie
Walt Harris. In 17 games he
allowed only 22 goals.
Harris was in goal for almost
the whole time in seven Cardinal
shutouts. Three times the
opposition was held to a single
score, six times he allowed only
two goals, and only once did he
allow more than two scores.
The offense, on the other
hand, was sporadic, despite
scoring 45 goals on the year. The
Cards were shutout only three
times, but were held to a single
score in seven games.

Stanford started the season
with an upset win over San Jose
State, 1-0. The booters recorded
their second straight shutout the
next week as they stomped
College of Notre Dame, 11-0.
Only Big Loss
The Cards next took on USF,
the top team on the coast, and fell
apart, 7-0, for their only big loss
of the season.
Their next three defeats were
at the hands of UC-Davis, UCLA
and Santa Clara by identical
scores of 2-1. In each of the three
games, Stanford's opponent
scored once on a penalty kick,
which provided the margin of
victory.
After falling to a 2-3 record
(the Santa Clara loss came later in
the season), the Cards won three
straight, including two 1-0
shutouts over Canada College and
Cal State-Chico. Their third win
was a 4-2 whipping of Menlo
college.
Following those wins and the
Santa Clara loss, the Cards
remained unbeaten for seven
games. First came three impressive
victories: a 6-2 conquest of the
Naval Post Graduate School, an
8-0 shutout of Cal
State-Humboldt, and a 3-1 defeat
of Cal State-San Francisco.
Scoreless Draws
In the next three contests, the
booters sandwiched a win
between two scoreless draws.
California and University of
Pacific provided the ties and Cal
State-Hayward suffered a 4-1
setback.
Last week, in a sloppy game,
the Cards nipped St. Patrick's 2-1,
which along with the Westmont
loss, brings the season to a close.
Brian Bershader was the
leading scorer for the Cards,
coming on strong toward the end
of the season with a total of nine
goals. Phil Wright had seven
scores. Bobby Geiger and Ricky
Caldwell, both who were out part
of the season, each had five
points.
Johnny Murao had four;
Robbie Robb and Tom Miller
scored three each. Mac Taylor and
Harris each had a pair, and Chico
De La Guardia, Jeff Hall, Grant
Heidrick, Alan Mc Donald and
Marty Glickfeld each put in one
shot.
Playing without any hope of a
playoff berth, the Stanford soccer
team lost its final game of the
season to Westmont College
yesterday, 2-1, in Santa Barbara.
Westmont got its first score
when a Cardinal player, trying to
head the ball away from the goal,
miscalculated and knocked it into
the net. In the second half,
Westmont scored again on what
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle
called a "good shot."
Alan McDonald scored the lone
Card goal when he lofted a shot
past the Westmont netminder.
Priddle said the team played "a
very good game." He felt the team
over-reacted a little because they
wanted to win "so badly."
Last Friday it was announced
that Santa Clara would be the
fourth team in the West Coast
playoffs. USF, UCLA and

Washington were the other three
teams chosen. The Cards and San
Jose State had been considered
for the final spot.
