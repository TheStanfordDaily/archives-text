# Pac-8 Basketball
## Sad News Awaits Second Division 
### DAVE ROBINSON Second of Two Parts 
"It will be very easy," jsaid
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar,
"for some teams in the Paci>B to
have a heck of a club and still
finish around 6-8 in the league."
That's the sad news awaiting
Washington, California,
Washington State and Oregon
State, teams that may play some
brilliant basketball but are still
destined to spend most of the
season on the lower rungs of the
conference standings.
Washington's Marv Harshman
says the Huskies have "the best
front line I've had in years," but
"I don't know if we're better or
not. I think we are, but I don't
know if we can lose the league's
leading scorer [Louie Nelson] and
consider ourselves better."
Harshman has "more depth
than last year" though, and his
center situation has "improved

tremendously." Lars Hansen will
start in the middle, with Ray Price
and JC transfer Larry Pounds at
the forwards. Ron Williams and
Ron Bird are the probable
backcourt starters.
Harshman's starting lineup is
far from secure, however.
Freshman Chester Dorsey
("probably our most complete
guard"), may move into the top
five to provide what Harshman
calls "the breakthrough we need
to be competitive."
California, another team with
five frosh on the varsity, must
survive a treacherous early season
schedule before entering the
conference season. "Eight of our
10 December games are on the
road," said Bear coach Dick
Edwards. "If we survive
December, we'll certainly be
tougher because of it."
Edwards is counting on
returnees Carl Meier, Ricky
Hawthorne and Brady Allen to

keep the Bears alive while the
frosh are maturing. Those three
are sure starters, along with JC
transfer John Terry. The center
spot, however, "is up for grabs."
Rocky Lee, a 6-10 freshman, is
currently battling Sam Krupsky,
Erik Vaaler and Pat Matola for the
starting spot in the middle.
"We plan no big changes,"
Edwards said. "We just hope to be
a little more versatile defensively
and improve our outside
shooting."
Washington State coach George
Raveling, who somehow lured
players from North Carolina,
Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri,
Connecticut and even Yugoslavia
to come to Pullman, guarantees
that his Cougars "are at least 50
percent better" than last year's
cellar-dwellers.
Raveling's hopes are centered
around 6-11V&, 258 pound
freshman Steve Puidokas, who has
been "a super-pleasant surprise,"
shooting 57 percent from the
field, 92 percent from the line and
leading the Cougars in rebounding
during the team's five game-type
scrimmages.
Puidokas will join guards Brad

Jackson ond Sammy Miller ("the
quickest p'ayer in the league")
and forwards Edgar Jeffries and
JC transfer Ricl v Brown in the
starting lineup.
T'ansfer student Norton
Barnhill, "the best player in the
program," according to Raveling,
is currently ineligible but will join
the team in early January.
"We're going to run for 40
minutes every game," Raveling
said, "whether we get beat by 100
or win by 20. We have a total
commitment to the fast break."
Oregon State has seven
lettermen returning, but Beaver
coach Ralph Miller says much of
his ieam's success will depend on
the development of his freshmen,
four of whom are currently
among his 10 best players.
Two frosh, forward Lonnie
Shelton and guard George Tucker,
should start, along with veterans
Charlie Neal and Paul Miller. Steve
Erickson and Doug Oxsen are
battling for the starting center
job.
"Our future," says Miller,
"depends on the proper blending
of the older players and the
newcomers."

Washington State and Oregon
State, teams that may play some
brilliant basketball but are still
destined to spend most of the
season on the lower rungs of the
conference standings.
Washington's Marv Harshman
says the Huskies have "the best
front line I've had in years," but
"I don't know if we're better or
not. I think we are, but I don't
know if we can lose the league's
leading scorer [Louie Nelson] and
consider ourselves better."
Harshman has "more depth
than last year" though, and his
center situation has "improved

tremendously." Lars Hansen will
start in the middle, with Ray Price
and JC transfer Larry Pounds at
the forwards. Ron Williams and
Ron Bird are the probable
backcourt starters.
Harshman's starting lineup is
far from secure, however.
Freshman Chester Dorsey
("probably our most complete
guard"), may move into the top
five to provide what Harshman
calls "the breakthrough we need
to be competitive."
California, another team with
five frosh on the varsity, must
survive a treacherous early season
schedule before entering the
conference season. "Eight of our
10 December games are on the
road," said Bear coach Dick
Edwards. "If we survive
December, we'll certainly be
tougher because of it."
Edwards is counting on
returnees Carl Meier, Ricky
Hawthorne and Brady Allen to

keep the Bears alive while the
frosh are maturing. Those three
are sure starters, along with JC
transfer John Terry. The center
spot, however, "is up for grabs."
Rocky Lee, a 6-10 freshman, is
currently battling Sam Krupsky,
Erik Vaaler and Pat Matola for the
starting spot in the middle.
"We plan no big changes,"
Edwards said. "We just hope to be
a little more versatile defensively
and improve our outside
shooting."
Washington State coach George
Raveling, who somehow lured
players from North Carolina,
Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri,
Connecticut and even Yugoslavia
to come to Pullman, guarantees
that his Cougars "are at least 50
percent better" than last year's
cellar-dwellers.
Raveling's hopes are centered
around 6-11V&, 258 pound
freshman Steve Puidokas, who has
been "a super-pleasant surprise,"
shooting 57 percent from the
field, 92 percent from the line and
leading the Cougars in rebounding
during the team's five game-type
scrimmages.
Puidokas will join guards Brad

Jackson ond Sammy Miller ("the
quickest p'ayer in the league")
and forwards Edgar Jeffries and
JC transfer Ricl v Brown in the
starting lineup.
T'ansfer student Norton
Barnhill, "the best player in the
program," according to Raveling,
is currently ineligible but will join
the team in early January.
"We're going to run for 40
minutes every game," Raveling
said, "whether we get beat by 100
or win by 20. We have a total
commitment to the fast break."
Oregon State has seven
lettermen returning, but Beaver
coach Ralph Miller says much of
his ieam's success will depend on
the development of his freshmen,
four of whom are currently
among his 10 best players.
Two frosh, forward Lonnie
Shelton and guard George Tucker,
should start, along with veterans
Charlie Neal and Paul Miller. Steve
Erickson and Doug Oxsen are
battling for the starting center
job.
"Our future," says Miller,
"depends on the proper blending
of the older players and the
newcomers."
"It will be very easy," jsaid
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar,
"for some teams in the Paci>B to
have a heck of a club and still
finish around 6-8 in the league."
