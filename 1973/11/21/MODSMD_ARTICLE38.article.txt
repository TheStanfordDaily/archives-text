# Cardinal Seniors Close Out Eventful Stanford Careers
## 
### MARK WHITE 
After the final game of the
1973 season against Cal this
Saturday, Stanford's football
team will be without a single Rose
Bowl veteran for the first time in
three years. The few remaining
players who participated in
Stanford's last victory in Pasadena
are now seniors and The Big Game
will be the last in which they
compete for Stanford.
Compared to past years, the
players of the class of 1973
leaving are not great in number.
Of the 19 seniors graduating, only
eight were starters during the
regular season. But as a group,
they are deep in quality and the
losses at the skill positions of
defensive back and quarterback
will be acutely felt "during the
early development of the 1974
Cardinal team.
Unlike the 1972 seniors, who
were typified to a certain extent
by Pete Lzetich and Jim Butler in
their unified enthusiasm and
"Thunderchicken" devil-may-care
attitude, this year's seniors did
not have a distinctive feature or
characteristic.
Head coach Jack Christiansen,
the man who saw them develop
from green freshmen in 1969-70
into veterans of 1973, recently
said, "There really is not any one
thing about these seniors that
sticks out. As with most any
football group, you could only
classify four or five as great, the
rest of the players had mostly
average college football talent.
But as a group they were a great
bunch of kids to coach, the kind
of group a coach likes to have,
and they had some great games.
I'm glad the players went to
Pasadena — its a great reward
playing in the Rose Bowl."
Numbers A Factor
SEnior defensive tackle Joe
Martin, who recently had an
outstanding game against USC,
thinks their numbers was a factor
influencing the role of this year's
seniors. "I think one reason the
team wasn't shaped around us was
a result of there being not that

many of us in the first place,"
Martin said. "Most of the team
this year was composed of
younger players and as a result the
team really couldn't be unified
behind us. In the next couple of
years, though, because so many of
the younger players have matured
to such a great extent this year, I
think Stanford is going to be
really tough."
Indeed, while some individual
seniors will be sorely missed,
graduations will not leave gaping
holes in the Stanford roster. Only
four offensive starters are leaving,
and except for center Bill Reid,
the young offensive line will
return intact. Tight end Glen
Stone and flanker Reggie Ishman
both had fine seasons, but there
are several capable receivers
waiting in the wings.
Boryla Sorely Missed
John Winesberry was lost when
he incurred a knee injury early
this season, but his replacements
return next year. The critical slot
that will have to be filled in the
future, however, is currently held
by the second place all-time
Stanford passer and a player who,
before the year is out, will be
accorded much national acclaim.
Mike Boryla will be missed and it
would be quite a feat if Mike
Cordova, Jerry Waldvogel or Guy
BEnjamin come close to
duplicating recent Boryla
performances.
Punter Dave Ottmar is leaving
and it is doubtful Stanford will
find another Rod Garcia. But the
only area where the Cardinals will
be in trouble on defense will be in
the secondary. Defensive tackles
Martin and Pete Hanson,
according to Christiansen, "played
outstanding all year long," but
both of the good Card ends,
Roger Still well and Pat Donovan,
return.
"We may need a few good
defensive backs from junior
colleges, though," Christiansen
said, when confronted with the
graduation of four stellar
defensive backs.
All-American Randy Poltl,

gutty Craig Zaltosky, persistent
Jim Kaffen and smooth James
Ferguson comprised the senior
backbone of one of the best
defensive backfields in Stanford
history. The loss of any two
would be a serious problem — the
loss of all four is an ingriguing
challenge.
"Things jelled for this team
late in the season" said Paltl, "and
I think that even without us
seniors, Stanford is going to go a
long way next year.
"Playing for Stanford was
great; it was more than I ever
expected it to be. The whole
Stanford style is incomparable to
any other program I've seen. I'm
happy to have played here."

return next year. The critical slot
that will have to be filled in the
future, however, is currently held
by the second place all-time
Stanford passer and a player who,
before the year is out, will be
accorded much national acclaim.
Mike Boryla will be missed and it
would be quite a feat if Mike
Cordova, Jerry Waldvogel or Guy
BEnjamin come close to
duplicating recent Boryla
performances.
Punter Dave Ottmar is leaving
and it is doubtful Stanford will
find another Rod Garcia. But the
only area where the Cardinals will
be in trouble on defense will be in
the secondary. Defensive tackles
Martin and Pete Hanson,
according to Christiansen, "played
outstanding all year long," but
both of the good Card ends,
Roger Still well and Pat Donovan,
return.
"We may need a few good
defensive backs from junior
colleges, though," Christiansen
said, when confronted with the
graduation of four stellar
defensive backs.
All-American Randy Poltl,

gutty Craig Zaltosky, persistent
Jim Kaffen and smooth James
Ferguson comprised the senior
backbone of one of the best
defensive backfields in Stanford
history. The loss of any two
would be a serious problem — the
loss of all four is an ingriguing
challenge.
"Things jelled for this team
late in the season" said Paltl, "and
I think that even without us
seniors, Stanford is going to go a
long way next year.
"Playing for Stanford was
great; it was more than I ever
expected it to be. The whole
Stanford style is incomparable to
any other program I've seen. I'm
happy to have played here."

THE LAST CONTEST — Quarterback Mike Boryla is one of 19 Card
seniors who will be playing their last collegiate game Saturday when
Stanford hosts California in the 76th renewal of the Big Game.
Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m. at Stanford Stadium.
After the final game of the
1973 season against Cal this
Saturday, Stanford's football
team will be without a single Rose
Bowl veteran for the first time in
three years. The few remaining
players who participated in
Stanford's last victory in Pasadena
are now seniors and The Big Game
will be the last in which they
compete for Stanford.
Compared to past years, the
players of the class of 1973
leaving are not great in number.
Of the 19 seniors graduating, only
eight were starters during the
regular season. But as a group,
they are deep in quality and the
losses at the skill positions of
defensive back and quarterback
will be acutely felt "during the
early development of the 1974
Cardinal team.
Unlike the 1972 seniors, who
were typified to a certain extent
by Pete Lzetich and Jim Butler in
their unified enthusiasm and
"Thunderchicken" devil-may-care
attitude, this year's seniors did
not have a distinctive feature or
characteristic.
Head coach Jack Christiansen,
the man who saw them develop
from green freshmen in 1969-70
into veterans of 1973, recently
said, "There really is not any one
thing about these seniors that
sticks out. As with most any
football group, you could only
classify four or five as great, the
rest of the players had mostly
average college football talent.
But as a group they were a great
bunch of kids to coach, the kind
of group a coach likes to have,
and they had some great games.
I'm glad the players went to
Pasadena — its a great reward
playing in the Rose Bowl."
Numbers A Factor
SEnior defensive tackle Joe
Martin, who recently had an
outstanding game against USC,
thinks their numbers was a factor
influencing the role of this year's
seniors. "I think one reason the
team wasn't shaped around us was
a result of there being not that

many of us in the first place,"
Martin said. "Most of the team
this year was composed of
younger players and as a result the
team really couldn't be unified
behind us. In the next couple of
years, though, because so many of
the younger players have matured
to such a great extent this year, I
think Stanford is going to be
really tough."
Indeed, while some individual
seniors will be sorely missed,
graduations will not leave gaping
holes in the Stanford roster. Only
four offensive starters are leaving,
and except for center Bill Reid,
the young offensive line will
return intact. Tight end Glen
Stone and flanker Reggie Ishman
both had fine seasons, but there
are several capable receivers
waiting in the wings.
Boryla Sorely Missed
John Winesberry was lost when
he incurred a knee injury early
this season, but his replacements
return next year. The critical slot
that will have to be filled in the
future, however, is currently held
by the second place all-time
Stanford passer and a player who,
before the year is out, will be
accorded much national acclaim.

their unified enthusiasm and
"Thunderchicken" devil-may-care
attitude, this year's seniors did
not have a distinctive feature or
characteristic.
Head coach Jack Christiansen,
the man who saw them develop
from green freshmen in 1969-70
into veterans of 1973, recently
said, "There really is not any one
thing about these seniors that
sticks out. As with most any
football group, you could only
classify four or five as great, the
rest of the players had mostly
average college football talent.
But as a group they were a great
bunch of kids to coach, the kind
of group a coach likes to have,
and they had some great games.
I'm glad the players went to
Pasadena — its a great reward
playing in the Rose Bowl."
Numbers A Factor
SEnior defensive tackle Joe
Martin, who recently had an
outstanding game against USC,
thinks their numbers was a factor
influencing the role of this year's
seniors. "I think one reason the
team wasn't shaped around us was
a result of there being not that

many of us in the first place,"
Martin said. "Most of the team
this year was composed of
younger players and as a result the
team really couldn't be unified
behind us. In the next couple of
years, though, because so many of
the younger players have matured
to such a great extent this year, I
think Stanford is going to be
really tough."
Indeed, while some individual
seniors will be sorely missed,
graduations will not leave gaping
holes in the Stanford roster. Only
four offensive starters are leaving,
and except for center Bill Reid,
the young offensive line will
return intact. Tight end Glen
Stone and flanker Reggie Ishman
both had fine seasons, but there
are several capable receivers
waiting in the wings.
Boryla Sorely Missed
John Winesberry was lost when
he incurred a knee injury early
this season, but his replacements
return next year. The critical slot
that will have to be filled in the
future, however, is currently held
by the second place all-time
Stanford passer and a player who,
before the year is out, will be
accorded much national acclaim.
Mike Boryla will be missed and it
would be quite a feat if Mike
Cordova, Jerry Waldvogel or Guy
BEnjamin come close to
duplicating recent Boryla
performances.
Punter Dave Ottmar is leaving
and it is doubtful Stanford will
find another Rod Garcia. But the
only area where the Cardinals will
be in trouble on defense will be in
the secondary. Defensive tackles
Martin and Pete Hanson,
according to Christiansen, "played
outstanding all year long," but
both of the good Card ends,
Roger Still well and Pat Donovan,
return.
"We may need a few good
defensive backs from junior
colleges, though," Christiansen
said, when confronted with the
graduation of four stellar
defensive backs.
All-American Randy Poltl,

gutty Craig Zaltosky, persistent
Jim Kaffen and smooth James
Ferguson comprised the senior
backbone of one of the best
defensive backfields in Stanford
history. The loss of any two
would be a serious problem — the
loss of all four is an ingriguing
challenge.
"Things jelled for this team
late in the season" said Paltl, "and
I think that even without us
seniors, Stanford is going to go a
long way next year.
"Playing for Stanford was
great; it was more than I ever
expected it to be. The whole
Stanford style is incomparable to
any other program I've seen. I'm
happy to have played here."
