# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Traditional rivalries occupy
this weekend's Pacific Eight
schedule, as conference teams
fight for local superiority and,
in one case at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, a berth in the Rose
Bowl.
Predicting such contests is
always difficult, but the Daily's
prognosticator is overflowing
with confidence after
improving his season record to
33 6 1 last week with a perfect
4-0 performance.
In the featured attraction at
the Coliseum, UCLA should
win because of its most ignored
strength — its defense Both
teams have brilliant runners
and USC is stronger at
quarterback, but the Daily
looks for the Bruin defenders
to cause two or three Trojan
fumbles and win a wild one.
Washington State should
have little trouble with
Washington, despite last week's
determined Huskie effort

against USC. A Cougar victory
would probably mean the end
of Jim Owens' career as a Pac-8
head coach.
In Eugene, Oregon State
may pull off the weekend's
only upset. Beaver coach Dee
Andros should have his team
fired up for its season finale —
a situation that will bring
victory over an Oregon squad
that looked listless against
Stanford last week.
And at Stanford Stadium, a
crowd of 70,000 will be on
hand for the 76th Big Game, a
traditionally emotional
contest. The Daily, however, is
ignoring emotions and picking
Stanford on a purely physical
basis. The Cards are simply
better than the Bears and
should bring the Axe back to
the Farm.
