# Shockley Shouted Down At New York College
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Jerring, whistling and applauding,
about 900 students at Staten Island
Community College (SICC) last night
forced cancellation of a scheduled
presentation by Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley of his
controversial genetic views.
Shockley, who has proposed that
the intellectual and social position of
blacks is genetic in character and who
fears a retrogressive evolution through
the disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged, had

been scheduled to debate three New
York scholars as part of SICC's
President's Seminar Series.
"The tragic failure exhibited here is
a lack of faith in the intellectual
process and in the humanism of man,"
Shockley told the Daily after the
cancellation. "This, I believe, is what
underlies the fear and resentment."
Shockley complained that SICC
had provided inadequate audio visual
equipment for his presentation
although he had made particular
requests ahead of time, and that he
had not been permitted to distribute
his handouts.
"I believe they were
unintentionally setting me up as a
target," Shockley stated.
Invited By President
Shockley had been invited to speak
by SICC President William Birinbaum
in a series which lias included Justice
William O. Douglas and Black Panther
Party Chairman Bobby Seale.
Birinbaum continuously defended
Shockley's right to speak on first
amendment grounds. "I have made
every reasonable effort for a man's
ideas to be heard in my free country,"
he said after the cancellation.
Birinbaum called Shockley's ideas
"pernicious and vicious" but insisted
that "they should be faced in the
open."
Shockley was refused speaking time
last weekend at a New York University
conference sponsored by the
Committee Against Racism, although
he offered to pay for an extra hour of
platform operation, according to his
wife Emmy Shockley.
At Princeton University, where
Shockley is scheduled to debate IQ
differences, heredity and dysgenics
with Congress of Racial Equality
Director Roy Innis on Dec. 4, a

coalition of third world students and
faculty members has strongly urged
cancellation, insisting that the debate's
political significance outweighs any
perceived academic component.
Whig-Cliosophic Society
The Princeton debate, to be held
under the auspices of the
independently endowed, student
Whig-Cliosophic Society, was arranged
after opposition from the Harvard
Black Law Students Association and
several members of the school's
faculty forced cancellation of a
Shockley appearance before the
Harvard Law School Forum on Oct.
26.
"The issue is not debatable," stated
Princeton Third World Center
spokesman Earnest Tollerson
yesterday. "You cannot get up on a
stage and debate the humanity and
creativity of black people."
"It wouldn't matter if Shockley
were a Nobel laureate in genetics or if
the speaker were [Arthur] Jensen or
[Richard] Herrnstein," Tollerson said.
"The actors are irrelevant; the issue is
simply not debatable."
Tollerson called upon white
students "to take a moral stand" and
to oppose Princeton's providing a
forum for the event. Conditions at the
scene of the debate will determine the
strategy of demonstrators on Dec. 4,
he said.
Whig-Cliosophic Society President
Mike Shepard, whose governing
council voted 12-0 in favor of hosting
Innis and Shockley, noted receipt of
"a lot of favorable response from
generally apathetic students."
'Out In The Open'
"No matter what an idea is, the
best way to approach it is to put it out
in ths open," Shepard said.
Ntw York Times columnist Tom
Wicker recently called the Shockley
controversy at SICC a free speech
issue. Tollerson countered that the
invocation of free speech, which he
labeled as "essentially a democratic
fallacy," can be abused.
Despite suggestions from the Third
World Center that he refuse, Princeton
Sociology Prof. Marvin Bressler still
plans to moderate the Innis-Shockley
debate "for first amendment reasons,"
according to Daily Princetonian
Chairman Dave Zielenziger. "There's
going to be tension," Zielenziger said.
Innis has promised to "leave
Shockley an intellectual dead duck on
a frozen lake" in the Princeton debate.
At a recent Shockley appearance at
Dartmouth College, black students
applauded continuously to prevent
him from speaking.
Shockley had been invited to
appear live on the "Sunday" television
show in New York City on Nov. 25,
but that invitation was retracted when
Innis said he would be unavailable to
appear at the same time.
Shockley will appear live on the
"Take It From Here" telecast in
Washington D.C. on Nov. 27.
Returning to the West late in the
month, he will speak in Phoenix,
Arizona on the invention of the
transistor on Nov. 29.
Shockley, who in 1956 was a
co-winner of the Nobel Prize in
Physics for the invention of the
transistor, is on sabbatical from his
academic responsibilities in the
electrical engineering dept. this
quarter.
