# Cards Hope To Retain Axe
## Stanford, Cal Set For 76th Big Game 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Thanks to an inventive
fraternity, the Axe once again
belongs to Stanford — at least
until Saturday. Now it is up to the
Cardinal football team to keep the
historic symbol of Bay Area
football supremacy on the Farm
for another year.
Stanford (6-4) will meet
California (4-6) Saturday at
Stanford Stadium in the 76th
renewal of the Big Game rivalry.
Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m.
"It's something you really
don't have to get the players up
for," said Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen. "In fact we might
have to settle some of them down
during the middle of the week or
else they'll be too psyched at
game time."
Cal coach Mike White admits
that "we make a crusade out of
the Big Game — we make a
one-week season out of it."
For White, this will be his 20th
consecutive "one-week season."
He's played three different roles
in past Big Games, participating as
a Cal player, Stanford assistant
coach and as the Bear head coach.
He's won 12 times and lost seven
— the most gratifying victory
coming in last year's
heart-stopping 24-21 Cal victory
at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
This year, White will be

coaching against a Stanford team
he calls "one of the most
improved in the country." The
Cards are 6-0 against opponents
who aren't among the nation's top
10, mainly, White thinks, because
"they have one of the most
disciplined and soundest defenses
we've seen this year."
Attacking that defense,
however, is a Bear offensive unit
that features "a lot of guns,"
according to Christiansen. Cal has
versatile backs Chuck Muncie and
Howard Strickland, speedy
receivers Wesley Walker and Steve
Rivera, tight end Randy Schmidt
("the most technically perfect
man on our line," according to
Cal offensive line coach Howard
Mudd) and quarterbacks Vince
Ferragamo and Steve Bartkowski.
Those players provide the
potential for a veritable offensive
explosion — a happening that
already occurred once this year
when the Bears scored 54 points
against Washington. Muncie (135
carries, 672 yards), Walker (25.4
yards per pass reception) and
Strickland (108 carries, 600
yards) are all outstanding
statistically, and none of them —
particularly Strickland, tend to
downgrade their personal abilities.
"I've been compared to
Anthony Davis," Strickland said,
"but that's not fair — to him."
The 9.5 speedster, who cut
loose for 133 yards in 14 carries
last week against Washington
State, also said earlier in the
season that "if they give me the
ball, I'll be an Ail-American for
two years and I'll win the
Heisman Trophy."
Muncie is far less outspoken,
but his statistics are equally
impressive. Besides his 5.0 per
play rushing average, he ranks
second among Bear receivers with
24 catches. He's effective both up
the middle, where he uses his 228
pound bulk, and outside, where
he uses his 9.7 speed. He's
particularly devastating on goal
line situations, where his 6-8
high-jumping ability "makes Sam
Cunningham [former USC star)
look like a lard-ass," according to
Washington coach Jim Owens.
Those varied talents almost
belonged to Stanford — Muncie
sat on the Cardinal bench during
the 1972 Rose Bowl while being
recruited by former Stanford
assistant coach Roger Theder,

now a member of White's Cal
staff.
At quarterback, Vince
Ferragamo and Steve Bartkowski,
who sport identical .491
completion percentages, will both
see considerable action.
Bartkowski, a rifle-armed senior,
and Ferragamo, a smooth-faking
sophomore, have split the
signal-calling duties throughout
the season.
"I'm not going to make a
decision on who starts Saturday
until the ball is kicked off," White
said. "It all depends on the
weather, where we get the ball
and the situations — we're going
to use the quarterback whose
abilities fit each particular
situation."
Christiansen is worrying less
about strategy and more about
revenge. "Obviously, we
remember what happened last
year, and that should be enough
to get us ready to play — we're
just waiting to even the score."
A victory would give the Cards
a 7-4 season, an improvement over
last year despite the brutal
schedule. "I think our players
would settle for that,"
Christiansen said.
Stanford fans definitely would.

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
players elected Mike Boryla
(offense), Randy Poltl (defense)
and Craig Zaltosky (special teams)
as Big Game captains. Those three
will appear in future press books
as captains for the entire 1973
season.
Despite recent rains,
Christiansen promises that the
Stanford Stadium field won't
resemble the quagmire at Berkeley
last year. "I don't see how we
could duplicate that," he said,
"unless we go out and play
somewhere in the Bay."
With nine victories in the last
12 years, Stanford now leads the
historic series, 34-31-10. The

rivalry dates back to 1892, when
Herbert Hoover was a student
manager for Stanford and forgot
to bring the ball to the stadium
for the opening kickoff.
White said that starting
defensive end Chuck Hextrum
definitely won't play because of a
sprained neck. Otherwise, both
teams are reasonably healthy.
Boryla needs three touchdown
passes Saturday to tie Jim
Plunkett's Stanford record of 20
TD tosses in one season. Rod

Garcia needs two field goals to tie
Bob Jacobs' NCAA single-season
record of 18 and Eric Test can tie
Eric Cross' record of nine
touchdown catches in a season
with three on Saturday.
Ticket manager Bette
Robertson said that some student
tickets are still available. The $3
tickets will remain on sale
throughout the week at the
Athletic Department ticket office
and will also be sold at the
Stadium on Saturday.
