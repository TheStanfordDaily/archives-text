## Zetes Win 'A' Title 
### PETE BHATIA 
The Zetes won the 1973 Intramural Football championship
yesterday with an exciting, come-from-behind 19-18 victory over Biz
I.
Biz I had scored with 3:20 to play in the game on a five-yard toss
from quarterback Tom Steele to receiver Scott Schnuck and led
18-12, when the Zetes began their winning drive.
Quarterback Kim Hannaford tossed a screen pass to Randy Whittell
for two yards. After an incomplete pass, Hannaford launched the ball
35 yards downfield to the Biz 20 where receiver Skip Howard hauled
it in for a first down. On the play Hannaford rolled left and Howard
streaked down the right sideline, where all alone to the 20, he caught
the ball and fell down.
On the very next play, Hannaford threw for the touchdown to
Mike Moore, who had broken free in the deep left corner of the end
zone.
With the score then tied, 18-18, Hannaford hit Whittell, who had
delayed from a blocking position, sliding across the right side of the
line of scrimmage. Whittell cruised in untouched for the extra point
and the Zetes had their winning margin.

Biz I tried futilely to move the
ball and the Zetes took over on
downs and ran out the last minute
of the game.
The Zetes had taken the early
lead on a long drive, the first time
they had the ball and scored on a
five-yard TD flip from Hannaford
to ace Zete receiver Steve "Bobo"
Longbotham.
After a Biz 1 punt, Marty
O'Donaghue intercepted a Zete
pass and Biz drove to a first and
goal on the Zete eight yard line.
However, penalties set them back
and they failed to score.
With only :03 second
remaining in the first half, Biz I
tied the game on a 3 yard toss
from Steele to Woodward
The win gave the Zete's their
second consecutive "A" league
championship and set the stage
for a rare double championship in
football. In the "B" finals to be
played next Tuesday, the Zete
"B" team meets the KA "B" 's. In
that game the Zetes will be
heavily favored.

In other IM news, the
top-seeded Theta Delts moved
into the semifinals of the
two-player volleyball tourney
Monday by virtue of a 2-0
drubbing of Shakey's I. Also, Biz I
has moved through the first
rounds of the final free throw
playoffs and looks like a fairly
sure winner.
Tonight, at 7:30 in Maples
Pavilion, the Cal IM six-man
volleyball champions will take on
an all-star team from last year's
Stanford six-man champions,
Theta Delta Chi. It should be an
exciting match and the public is
invited and urged to attend.
