# Ferocious IM Battles
## Coed Gridders Play Like Pros 
### STAN WILSON 
A cold autumn wind whipped across the
rain-soaked gridiron. It was a clear Sunday
afternoon, and the fans and players crowded
in anticipation near midfield while the
defensive coach shouted last-minute
instructions to his team.
"Turn the play inside, ends. Linebackers —
you've gotta cover the flat!"
Too late. A quick fake inside and the right
end cut outside to haul in a well-placed if
imperfectly thrown pass. One more move
inside and the speedster cut for daylight and a
crucial six points en route to a 20-0 upset win.
Who is this mystery team? The San
Francisco Forty-Niners? The Stanford
Cardinals? The Stinson Beach Chargers?
Nope — they're the Junipero Ducks, and
the game is women's intramural flag football,
a version of the game that is almost as
complicated, sometimes as rough and always
as exciting as its professional and collegiate
counterparts.
Ferocity
The sure-handed receiver is Anne Peters, a
junior coed who runs like Gale Sayers and
plays defense with a ferocity that invites
comparisons to Dick Butkus.
Peters is a talented athlete who does it all
for the Ducks — she runs, passes, punts and
probably blows up the football and paints the
goalposts in her spare time. Last Sunday she
recorded three interceptions, two touchdowns
and a conversion to lead Junipero to a 20-0
victory over the defending champion Zulus to
qualify the Ducks for the round-robin
championship tournament to be held next
week.
The other two teams to qualify were the
Guthrie Alumni, by virtue of a 19-0 shutout
over Roth, and the irrepressible Guthrie

Hornets, who posted a 25-19 win over the
Storey Statutories, a win which just has to be
a highlight in the careers of young head
coaches Dennis Peterson and Brad Williams.
Grueling Schedule
Those three teams are the sole survivors of
an original field of 18 — survivors of a grueling
schedule which included weekly workouts and
weight training as well as the weekly battles
on the field.
The result of all this hard work is teams
which are capable of intricate zone defenses,
fancy pass patterns and something bearing
strong resemblance to a veer-option attack.
One team even dusted the cobwebs off of a
1928 Fighting Irish playbook and came up
with a Statute of Liberty play that Stanford's
Mike Boryla really ought to consider for his
offensive repetoire in Saturday's Big Game.
And the games are often as rough as they
are interesting. "Girls are really dirty football
players," says Renee Raimondi, Zulu wide
receiver. The facts would seem to bear her out
in some instances. One team featured a
linebacker who demolished opposing runners
with enough power to make even an Anthony
Davis wish he'd zigged instead of zagged.
"It's serious business," explains Guthrie
Alumni quarterback Nancy Miller, a
Cosmopolitan pre season All-American pick.
The games are "really competitive," she
explains, "and people really get psyched up."
But more important than the competitive
aspect is "the chance to get together and have
a really good time," according to Miller. Some
teams have training table at Wilbur, while
others gather at the Rat's or The Amber
Lantern.
And after Sunday's impressive victory,
Guthrie Hornets threw a post-game function
that would humble even a Rickey's no-host
cocktail party.

One team even dusted the cobwebs off of a
1928 Fighting Irish playbook and came up
with a Statute of Liberty play that Stanford's
Mike Boryla really ought to consider for his
offensive repetoire in Saturday's Big Game.
And the games are often as rough as they
are interesting. "Girls are really dirty football
players," says Renee Raimondi, Zulu wide
receiver. The facts would seem to bear her out
in some instances. One team featured a
linebacker who demolished opposing runners
with enough power to make even an Anthony
Davis wish he'd zigged instead of zagged.
"It's serious business," explains Guthrie
Alumni quarterback Nancy Miller, a
Cosmopolitan pre season All-American pick.
The games are "really competitive," she
explains, "and people really get psyched up."
But more important than the competitive
aspect is "the chance to get together and have
a really good time," according to Miller. Some
teams have training table at Wilbur, while
others gather at the Rat's or The Amber
Lantern.
And after Sunday's impressive victory,
Guthrie Hornets threw a post-game function
that would humble even a Rickey's no-host
cocktail party.

PITCHOUT — Shelley Content of the Storey
Statutories takes a pitch from the quarterback
in Sunday's titanic semifinal game against the
Guthrie Hornets. Despite Content's 11-vard
gain on this play, (he Hornets stymied the
Satwtories 25-19 before a capacity crowd on
the intramural fields.
A cold autumn wind whipped across the
rain-soaked gridiron. It was a clear Sunday
afternoon, and the fans and players crowded
in anticipation near midfield while the
defensive coach shouted last-minute
instructions to his team.
"Turn the play inside, ends. Linebackers —
you've gotta cover the flat!"
Too late. A quick fake inside and the right
end cut outside to haul in a well-placed if
imperfectly thrown pass. One more move
inside and the speedster cut for daylight and a
crucial six points en route to a 20-0 upset win.
Who is this mystery team? The San
Francisco Forty-Niners? The Stanford
Cardinals? The Stinson Beach Chargers?
Nope — they're the Junipero Ducks, and
the game is women's intramural flag football,
a version of the game that is almost as
complicated, sometimes as rough and always
as exciting as its professional and collegiate
counterparts.
Ferocity
The sure-handed receiver is Anne Peters, a
junior coed who runs like Gale Sayers and
plays defense with a ferocity that invites
comparisons to Dick Butkus.
Peters is a talented athlete who does it all
for the Ducks — she runs, passes, punts and
probably blows up the football and paints the
goalposts in her spare time. Last Sunday she
recorded three interceptions, two touchdowns
and a conversion to lead Junipero to a 20-0
victory over the defending champion Zulus to
qualify the Ducks for the round-robin
championship tournament to be held next
week.
The other two teams to qualify were the
Guthrie Alumni, by virtue of a 19-0 shutout
over Roth, and the irrepressible Guthrie

Hornets, who posted a 25-19 win over the
Storey Statutories, a win which just has to be
a highlight in the careers of young head
coaches Dennis Peterson and Brad Williams.
Grueling Schedule
Those three teams are the sole survivors of
an original field of 18 — survivors of a grueling
schedule which included weekly workouts and
weight training as well as the weekly battles
on the field.
The result of all this hard work is teams
which are capable of intricate zone defenses,
fancy pass patterns and something bearing
strong resemblance to a veer-option attack.
