Saxbe Eligibility Bill To Senate
WASHINGTON — Without making a recommendation,
the Senate Judiciary Committee turned over to the Senate
a bill intended to make Sen. William B. Saxbe, R-Ohio,
eligible for appointment as attorney general.
The effect of the unanimous vote yesterday was to
refer to the Senate the controversy over whether the
administration-proposed bill can remove Saxbe's
constitutional disqualification for the Cabinet post.
The bill is slated to be brought up in the Senate after it
votes next Tuesday on the nomination of Rep. Gerald R.
Ford, R-Mich., to be vice president.
Saxbe's nomination has been held up because the
Constitution prohibits the appointment of a Congress
member during the term for which he was elected, to an
office for which the salary has been increased in that time.
Saxbe, whose term does not expire until Jan. 3, 1975,
was a member of the Senate in 1969 when the salary of
the attorney general and other Cabinet members was
increased from $35,000 to $60,000 a year.
The administration has submitted a bill to roll back the
attorney general's pay to $35,000 in an effort to
overcome Saxbe's ineligibility for the post.
Mideast POW Exchange Continues
The prisoner of war airlift shuttled more Egyptian and
Israeli POWs home yesterday, and the United Nations
announced plans to add Americans and Russians to its
cease-fire observer force.
The prisoner exchange, part of the cease-fire agreement
worked out with the help of U.S. Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger, brought 20 more Israeli prisoners
home, making a total of 182 repatriated so far by Israeli
count.
The Egyptians say they captured 247 during the
October war.
The Israeli military command reported it has sent back
more than 7000 of its 822i captured Egyptians.
U.N. spokesman Rudolph Stajduhar told a news
conference that 36 Americans and 36 Russians will be
placed on observer teams. He did not say when they
would be assigned.
Limited Immunity Effort Delayed
WASHINGTON — The special Watergate prosecutor's
office yesterday delayed a Senate Watergate committee
effort to gain limited immunity for John H. Meier, a
former employee of billionaire Howard Hughes and
long-time associate of President Nixon's brother, F.
Donald Nixon.
The Senate panel had asked Chief U.S. District Court
Judge John J. Sirica to grant Meier immunity from
prosecution based on any evidence he might furnish the
committee.
But Sirica granted the prosecutors' request yesterday
that he block the immunity order until Dec. 5, the
maximum delay permitted by law. The prosecutors gave

no reason for their request.
Meier, according to several sources, has information
relating to Hughes' $100,000 cash gift to C.G. "Bebe"
Rebozo, the President's close friend and Key Biscayne,
Fla., neighbor.
Nixon Goes Before Governors
MEMPHIS, Tenn. — President Nixon took his
Watergate defense to the Republican governors yesterday
but first told a cheering crowd in Memphis that when
Americans have problems they go out and solve them.
While not referring directly to Watergate in his public
speech, Nixon made several references to being able to
solve other problems from the Middle East to the energy
crisis.
Nixon also drew a few boos and jeers from the crowds
estimated by local officials at about 5000. Some signs
read "Impeachment Now More Than Ever" and "Free
Democracy, Resign."
The Republican governors adopted a resolution
Monday generally praising Nixon's record in foreign and
domestic programs but indirectly urging him to clear up
the Watergate problem.
Astronauts Test Body Changes
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Skylab 3 astronauts used
cameras, needles and bulky machines yesterday to search
for changes occurring in their bodies as they adjust to
living in weightlessness.
Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Edward G. Gibson and
William R. Pogue, set to establish new space medical
frontiers with a record 84-day mission, spent hours
making new tests that may give unique data about man's
adjustment to space flight.
The spacemen started their fifth day in orbit by
drawing samples of their blood and processing them for
later study on the ground.
Three House Arrests By G reece
ATHENS — The Greek government, operating under
martial law as a result of student-worker riots, placed a
former premier and two ex-Cabinet ministers under house
arrest yesterday, reliable sources reported.
All three had protested the government's use of tanks
and troops to end last week's street rioting aimed at
toppling the military-backed government. They are also
active in an organization for the restoration of democracy
in Greece.
Arrested were Panayotis Caneilopoulos, 71,
conservative premier until the army toppled the
constitutional government in April 1967, and former
Cabinet ministers George Mavros and John Zigdis.
