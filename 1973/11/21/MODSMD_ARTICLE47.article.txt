Jessica Mitford, the woman who
drove the Famous Writer's School out
of business, said her husband bought
her stock in the school just after she
had published a slashing article in
Atlantic magazine charging that
famous authors lent their names to the
organization when they hadn't a
"clue" to its affairs.
"My hubby," she told enthralled
students at a communication dept.
guest lecture yesterday, "bought the
stock to neutralize my feelings. When
he found out that the school had been
dropped from the New York Stock

Exchange after my article, he wired
me the grand news that my shares
were no longer good.
The telegraph operator, unaware of
my success, asked him if he didn't
want to reword the telegram a bit
since he was sending it to his wife."
Mitford, best known to the
students for her most recent bout at
San Jose State, her refusal to be
fingerprinted as a member of the
faculty, kept them laughing with
stories about the mortician's trade
collected from her book The American
Way of Death.
When talking to morticians Mitford
said, "I liked to tease them a bit about
they lay-away plans."
She amused her audience with
quotations from funeral trade
magazines such as Casket and
Sunnyside, Mortuary Management and
Concept: Creative Ideas in Cemeteries.
An ad in one offered "practical
burial foot wear" which laces not only
at the instep but at the rear of the
shoe "to fit the deceased foot after
rigor mortis sets in," she said.
On the soul of the shoe, she added,
are the words "Double Wear."
Mitford, who also wrote and expose of
the American penal institution entitled
Kind and Usual Punishment,
concluded that prison walls were made
to "keep convicts in as well as
investigators out."
She explained having spent years
trying to receive a warden's trade
magazine called The Grapevine — "the
Casket and Sunnyside of the prison
business" — but the wardens were
wary of her, she claimed. Finally she
adopted a pseudonym, she said, and
wrote a letter to a warden claiming she
was a penologist student at Berkeley
who wanted to know the "real"
workings inside prisons.
She promptly received the full
twelve issues from the previous year,
one of them publishing her letter, she
claimed, praising an "astute" student.
Asked about the ethics involved in
posing as someone else, Mitford said,
"Perhaps I'm not terribly ethical."
Mittford carries a button with her
with the legend "Mitford thumbs her
toes at trustees of the University." Her
fingerprinting case, known as "finger
flack" on campus, is about to go to

court, and she said she expects to win.
University officials astounded her,
she said, when they asked her for
fingerprints. She was wearing a
bandaid on one of her fingers when
they told her, and she pointed at it,
saying, "See that? I've got nine more
where that came from."

adopted a pseudonym, she said, and
wrote a letter to a warden claiming she
was a penologist student at Berkeley
who wanted to know the "real"
workings inside prisons.
She promptly received the full
twelve issues from the previous year,
one of them publishing her letter, she
claimed, praising an "astute" student.
Asked about the ethics involved in
posing as someone else, Mitford said,
"Perhaps I'm not terribly ethical."
Mittford carries a button with her
with the legend "Mitford thumbs her
toes at trustees of the University." Her
fingerprinting case, known as "finger
flack" on campus, is about to go to

court, and she said she expects to win.
University officials astounded her,
she said, when they asked her for
fingerprints. She was wearing a
bandaid on one of her fingers when
they told her, and she pointed at it,
saying, "See that? I've got nine more
where that came from."
Jessica Mitford, the woman who
drove the Famous Writer's School out
of business, said her husband bought
her stock in the school just after she
had published a slashing article in
Atlantic magazine charging that
famous authors lent their names to the
organization when they hadn't a
"clue" to its affairs.
"My hubby," she told enthralled
students at a communication dept.
guest lecture yesterday, "bought the
stock to neutralize my feelings. When
he found out that the school had been
dropped from the New York Stock

Exchange after my article, he wired
me the grand news that my shares
were no longer good.
The telegraph operator, unaware of
my success, asked him if he didn't
want to reword the telegram a bit
since he was sending it to his wife."
Mitford, best known to the
students for her most recent bout at
San Jose State, her refusal to be
fingerprinted as a member of the
faculty, kept them laughing with
stories about the mortician's trade
collected from her book The American
Way of Death.
When talking to morticians Mitford
said, "I liked to tease them a bit about
they lay-away plans."
She amused her audience with
quotations from funeral trade
magazines such as Casket and
Sunnyside, Mortuary Management and
Concept: Creative Ideas in Cemeteries.
An ad in one offered "practical
burial foot wear" which laces not only
at the instep but at the rear of the
shoe "to fit the deceased foot after
rigor mortis sets in," she said.
On the soul of the shoe, she added,
are the words "Double Wear."
Mitford, who also wrote and expose of
the American penal institution entitled
Kind and Usual Punishment,
concluded that prison walls were made
to "keep convicts in as well as
investigators out."
She explained having spent years
trying to receive a warden's trade
magazine called The Grapevine — "the
Casket and Sunnyside of the prison
business" — but the wardens were
wary of her, she claimed. Finally she
adopted a pseudonym, she said, and
wrote a letter to a warden claiming she
