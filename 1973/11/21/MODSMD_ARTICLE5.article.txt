# Stanford Steals Big Game Axe
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
"The Infamous Three," a group of
thieves representing Stanford's chapter
of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity,
yesterday accomplished the eighth
heist in the 74-year history of the
Stanford Axe.
The Axe, a trophy that
traditionally goes to the winner of the
Stanford-Cal football game, had been
resting securely in a nuclear
attack-proof case at the Cal Student
Union, having been there since last
November, when the Bears won
possession of the trophy by defeating
the Cards, 24-21.
Securely, that is, until the Theta
Delts implemented a plan they called
"simple" and "oh, so smooth."
The heist was originally discovered
at the weekly meeting of the Northern
California Football Writers, held
yesterday at Ming's restaurant in Palo
Alto. Cal coach Mike White was paged,
and told by an anonymous Stanford
student that the Axe had been
captured — captured in fact, only a
few feet from the coaches and the
press in the Ming's parking lot.
One Witness
Only one reporter, however,
witnessed the heist. Lowell Hickey of
the Hayward Daily Review saw a fight
while he was parking his car. "I saw
two guys wearing Cal letter jackets
running with the Axe," Hickey said.
"They jumped in a car and took off."
Hickey, an unusually competent
reporter, noted that the car was a
"little yellow coupe with the license
number ASH-852."
But that fact proved to be an
irrelevant sidelight to a fascinating
story that unfolded yesterday
afternoon and was confirmed last
night in an anonymous statement
released by the "Infamous Three" —
two of whom were wearing those Cal
letter jackets when their theft was
completed in the Ming's parking lot.
'Alias Coach White'
The third accomplice, a Stanford
law student and brother of one of the
two Theta Delts, was "Alias Coach
White" in the plan — a strategy that
was originally conceived last summer.
"Coach White" called Mr. Fredrich,
the General Manager of the student
union on Monday and informed his
secretary that a wire-service

photographer had requested that the
Axe be brought to the Writer's
Luncheon for some publicity pictures.
"White," who had an early morning
engagement in Oakland, would stop by
for the Axe along with two of his
athletes on the way to the luncheon.
"He then called back at 10:15 a.m.
yesterday (presumably from Oakland),
conveying the message that he would
be late for the luncheon if he drove all
the way back to Berkeley for the Axe.
Instead, he suggested, the two players
would pick up the Axe and meet him
at Ming's.
Axe Missing
The two "athletes," dressed
appropriately in the illicitly obtained
Cal lettermen's jackets, strode
confidently into the student union and
discovered that the Axe wasn't in the
case — that it had been removed for
safe keeping by the Rally Committee
several days earlier.
"Thinking fast," the two Theta
Delts asked Friedrich to call the Rally
Committee. Four committee members

agreed to follow the Theta Delts to
Ming's, with the Axe in the back seat
of the Cal car.
A group of 10-15 fraternity
brothers were supposed to greet them
at the restaurant, but when the cars
arrived, the parking lot was empty.
Realizing that 4-2 was bad odds, one
of the "Infamous Three" suggested
that a Committee member go inside
and tell the real Coach White that they
were there.
Then, according to the Theta Delts,
"all hell broke loose." One of the
ingenious Infamous persuaded a
Committee member to let him hold
the Axe. He promptly started running
with the 50-pound plaque and after
100 yards, was tackled on the large
hood of a Cadillac.
The axe flew onto the roof of the
car at exactly the time the expected
fraternity brothers came to the rescue.
Within seconds, the Axe was on its
way to the campus.
Theta Delt spokesmen refused to
comment on the present location of
-he trophy.
