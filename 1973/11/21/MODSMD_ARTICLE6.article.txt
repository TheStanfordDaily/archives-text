# Lagunita Doubling-Up Option Cancelled
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Overcrowding caused by Stanford's housing
shortage will result in the end of Lagunita's "special
status," according to Larry Horton, associate dean
of student affairs for housing. Horton spoke on
KZSU's "Campus Conference" last night.
The University has cancelled the Lagunita
Overcrowding Option (LOOP), in which Lagunita
residents could guarantee that they would be
reassigned there so long as they agreed to double-up
in single rooms. Because this system did not depend
on the outcome of the annual housing lottery, it
gave Lagunita residents a "special status," according
to Horton.
"We have decided to do away with LOOP. I've
talked with the staff, and I believe the students are
informed. We will have students draw normally,"
Horton stated.
Rent Reductions
The popularity of Lagunita even when students
were forced to double up, gave the University
second thoughts on its policy of giving automatic
rent reductions to students who opted to live two to
a room, Horton said.
"It's under discussion ... as to whether or not
we should continue rent reduction. A student is at
Lagunita because he was lucky to get a low number
in the lottery, or he was there as a freshman,"

Horton observed.
Rumors that all rooms at Lagunita will be used as
doubles next year are unfounded, Horton claimed.
"Lagunita will be overcrowded, but not all
singles will be used for double occupancy," Horton
emphasized.
No New Dorms
There are no immediate plans for new building to
alleviate the housing crunch, Horton said.
"If the University decides to build more housing,
it can be an extremely costly decision. We're
studying the situation," he said.
And the "temporary" trailers at Manzanita Park
will be around for at least another two years,
Horton implied.
"When Manzanita Park was first put up, it was
estimated we would need it five years. It was also
estimated it would pay itself off in five years. It
will, I think, [pay for itself) in its sixth year, or
maybe its seventh," he noted. Horton would oppose
the trailers' demolition now because they provide
on-campus housing for hundreds of students now.
"However undesirable Manzanita Park is in some
perspectives, it is still better than living off-campus
and isolated," Horton claimed.
Gas Cutoff
Plans to save energy by closing dorms over
Christmas vacation were accentuated by yesterday's

cutoff of natural gas by PG&E.
Horton observed that there is "substantial"
precedent for closing off dormitories during term
breaks, stating that it used to be a common practice.
"There is a substantial precedent to close the
residences. There was a time when we closed down
the women's residences, but not the men's," he
concluded.
Black Quota Defended
Horton defended an authorization issued by his
office last year which would raise by one-third the
number of blacks allowed at Roble Hall to 40
percent.
"Several years ago we set up several programs
having loose priority percentages — we don't have
quotas. We were requested by black students to
assign black students [to Roble] on a priority
basis," Horton noted.
The University set up 56 priority spaces at Roble
for blacks this year; only 34 were used, Horton
stated. He added that the 40 percent priority level
in effect at Roble compares with a 50 percent level
at the other "theme" houses. Zapata House is 37
percent chicano; Roble is 32 percent black;
Junipero House is 50 percent Asian-American; and
Soto House is 20 percent native American,
according to figures released by Horton.

The University set up 56 priority spaces at Roble
for blacks this year; only 34 were used, Horton
stated. He added that the 40 percent priority level
in effect at Roble compares with a 50 percent level
at the other "theme" houses. Zapata House is 37
percent chicano; Roble is 32 percent black;
Junipero House is 50 percent Asian-American; and
Soto House is 20 percent native American,
according to figures released by Horton.
Overcrowding caused by Stanford's housing
shortage will result in the end of Lagunita's "special
status," according to Larry Horton, associate dean
of student affairs for housing. Horton spoke on
KZSU's "Campus Conference" last night.
The University has cancelled the Lagunita
Overcrowding Option (LOOP), in which Lagunita
residents could guarantee that they would be
reassigned there so long as they agreed to double-up
in single rooms. Because this system did not depend
on the outcome of the annual housing lottery, it
gave Lagunita residents a "special status," according
to Horton.
"We have decided to do away with LOOP. I've
talked with the staff, and I believe the students are
informed. We will have students draw normally,"
Horton stated.
Rent Reductions
The popularity of Lagunita even when students
were forced to double up, gave the University
second thoughts on its policy of giving automatic
rent reductions to students who opted to live two to
a room, Horton said.
"It's under discussion ... as to whether or not
we should continue rent reduction. A student is at
Lagunita because he was lucky to get a low number
in the lottery, or he was there as a freshman,"

Horton observed.
Rumors that all rooms at Lagunita will be used as
doubles next year are unfounded, Horton claimed.
"Lagunita will be overcrowded, but not all
singles will be used for double occupancy," Horton
emphasized.
No New Dorms
There are no immediate plans for new building to
alleviate the housing crunch, Horton said.
"If the University decides to build more housing,
it can be an extremely costly decision. We're
studying the situation," he said.
And the "temporary" trailers at Manzanita Park
will be around for at least another two years,
Horton implied.
"When Manzanita Park was first put up, it was
estimated we would need it five years. It was also
estimated it would pay itself off in five years. It
will, I think, [pay for itself) in its sixth year, or
maybe its seventh," he noted. Horton would oppose
the trailers' demolition now because they provide
on-campus housing for hundreds of students now.
"However undesirable Manzanita Park is in some
perspectives, it is still better than living off-campus
and isolated," Horton claimed.
Gas Cutoff
Plans to save energy by closing dorms over
Christmas vacation were accentuated by yesterday's

cutoff of natural gas by PG&E.
Horton observed that there is "substantial"
precedent for closing off dormitories during term
breaks, stating that it used to be a common practice.
"There is a substantial precedent to close the
residences. There was a time when we closed down
the women's residences, but not the men's," he
concluded.
Black Quota Defended
Horton defended an authorization issued by his
office last year which would raise by one-third the
number of blacks allowed at Roble Hall to 40
percent.
"Several years ago we set up several programs
having loose priority percentages — we don't have
quotas. We were requested by black students to
assign black students [to Roble] on a priority
basis," Horton noted.
