# Glamor Surrounding Kennedy Presidency Gone
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Ten years ago tomorrow. President
.John F. Kennedy was shot and killed
in Dallas, Tex. In the decade since the
assassination, much of the glamor
surrounding the Kennedy Presidency
has apparently worn off, and members
of the University community seem to
be taking a more critical view of his
administration and policies.
Most of the criticism centered
around Kennedy's handling of foreign
affairs. "Many of us have considerable
doubts about his Cold War strategy,"
said President Richard W. Lyman, also
a history' professor. Lyman said he was
"very outraged by the Bay of Pigs
episode," but added that his anger was
"toned down by the fact that
Kennedy admitted it was a fiasco."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen, who specializes in Latin
American politics, said he viewed the
Kennedy Administration "very
negatively."
"Kennedy was really the architect
of the exclusion of Cuba from the
hemisphere, and the one who
thoroughly modernized the Cold War
influence . . . and the
counter-insurgency doctrine in Latin
America," Fagen charged.
Bay Of Pigs
Barton Bernstein, associate
professor of history who has
extensively studied the Cold War, said
he was "shocked and dismayed by the

Bay of Pigs" invasion and that he
strongly opposed Kennedy's handling
of the Cuban missile crisis.
Bernstein said he "was never
necessarily convinced that [Kennedy]
was really moving toward a new
position on the Cold War. While on the
one hand he was speaking detente, he
was escalating the Cold War.
"The only action in foreign policy
one would want to admire is the Test
Ban Treaty," Bernstein concluded.
History Prof. Alexander Dallin, a
scholar on the Soviet Union, also
praised the treaty, but attributed its
signing to American success in the
missile crisis.
"I myself think that [the crisis]
was actually handled fairly skillfully,"
Dallin said. "I don't believe the thing
was contrived."
Dallin refused to place complete
blame for the Cold War on Kennedy,
claiming the Cold War "also depended
upon what the Russians were doing."
Miller Approves
Dean of the Graduate School of
Business Arjay Miller, a former
president of Ford Motors, who worked
at the Pentagon and at Ford with
Kennedy's Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara, applauded
Kennedy's handling of the Cuban
missile crisis.
"I don't think you can fault him on
that," Miller said. "It was a
confrontation ...The Russians

backed down, didn't they?
"About the Bay of Pigs, he played
that straight," Miller added. "He said
'I boo-booed.' "
Chapel Dean Robert G.H. Kelly
harshly criticized Kennedy's Vietnam
policy, calling it "a major blemish" on
his administration.
"I remember rather clearly the day
that he died," Kelly said. "I also
remember reading in The New York
Times at that time about the forgotten
war in Vietnam .... I think back on
that with a certain grim amusement
now."
Greatest Tragedy
"Maybe the greatest tragedy of
Kennedy's assassination," Kelly
concluded, "was that he was followed
by a man who pledged to carry on
[with Vietnam) when Kennedy
himself might not have carried on had
he lived."
Miller de-emphasized the
significance of the war in the Kennedy
administration, saying "we just kind of
blundered into that thing."
"The vast majority of the people
were supportive of what he did in
Vietnam," Miller contended. "I don't
think he was responsible for the
escalation of the Vietnam War."
Victor Li, associate law professor
specializing in Chinese law, questioned
Kennedy's policy toward the People's
Republic of China.
"He said a great deal about

improving relations, but there was far
less action than there were words," Li
said. "For all you can say about
Nixon, for China at least, the words
match the action."
Civil Rights
Regarding domestic issues, ASSU
Vice President Charles Ogletree said
Kennedy "was very effective [in
pushing civil rights]. I think the things
he had done were positive."
Bernstein, however, questioned
Kennedy's commitment to civil rights,
saying, "Kennedy, in characteristic
liberal fashion, spoke braver words,
but the action was quite limited."
Prof. George Leland Bach of the
Business School lauded Kennedy's
economic policies because "Kennedy
was the first President to embrace
thoroughly the principle of
government responsibility for
stabilizing economics — Keynesian
economics — and it was fairly
successful.
"Kennedy essentially tried to
rationalize use of government
economic policy to help impoverished
groups by redistributing income,"
Bach added.
Many of the respondents praised
Kennedy for bringing a new freshness
and vitality to American government.
