# Consumption Habits Must Change
## Oil Crisis Spurs Conservation Ethic 
### 
The decision by Stanford
officials to shut down the dorms
and other residence facilities
during the quarter break comes as
more of a disappointment than a
surprise. For plans to conserve
fuel and other resources have long
been in the talking stages. So it
appears that most of the
jaw-boning has ceased and really
significant action is being taken.
But is that action intelligent, or is
it just well-meaning?
The possibility of fuel
shortages had been pointed out by
PG&E officials, In a warning
Stanford received, according to
forecasted needs we would be
short about 3 days of fuel this
winter. Apparently the level of oil
reserves that the University is
allowed to retain do not meet that
need, or would pose the
possibility of drastic shortages in
emergency situations.
The plan was, and still is, we
can assume, to begin phasing out
any unnecessary fuel consumption
by shutting down all campus
facilities when not in use. And in
the wake of all this slowing up
and shutting down, a new athletic
facility has just opened.
We are then faced with the
paradox of expansion in the midst
of scarcity. And yet that
contradicition of terms will
probably become more common
until we can work out effective
and equitable ways of dealing
with the energy problem.
What is most unfortunate, and
potentially dangerous, is that in
the wake of the oil crisis, many
temporary, stop-gap measures are
being taken in somewhat a
well-meant but helter-skelter
fashion. With no future guarantees
that the Arab nations will stop
politicizing their oil production,
the international community is
having to come to grips with the
reality that they must align with
the Arabs on certain issues or find
alternatives to their current
energy sources.
Self-Sufficiency
The U.S., at least under the
current administration, has chosen
the course of attaining
self-sufficiency. But what is odd is
that for all the hardship the Middle
East calamity is causing, we have
the Arabs to thank for bringing us
around to harsh reality before it is
really too late.
For what their embargo has
accomplished is an artificial

shortage of sorts, similar to the
efforts of our own oil companies
in their attempts to gain
anti-competitive strangleholds. So
we got a rude awakening, but
from here on we have only
ourselves to blame for our
mischief.
The two most important things
to come out of this artificial crisis
should be first, a basic change in
the consumption habits of the
nation as a whole, the
development of a conservation
ethic in all citizens; second, a
wide-ranging, effective plan of
sufficient scope to begin to
alleviate current problems and

anticipate future areas of concern
before they reach crisis
proportions.
Massive Bureaucracy
The bureaucratic machinery
necessary to carry out such a
project would be so massive as to
defy one's imagination, but much
of the calamity of governmental
mismanagement could be avoided
if the individual would take upon
himself the task of reorganizing
his own life style. Conditions as
we are beginning to foresee them
necessitate rapid, drastic change,
and we as individuals can better
carry out those objectives than

any tax-fattened bureaucrat.
We at Stanford, and all of the
universities have a responsibility
to take the lead in developing the
conservation ethic. And of course
the technological community has
a special role in creating new
systems to solve problems of
scarcity while reinventing old
methodologies to suit future
needs. Because what becomes
imminently possible is that in
failing to live up to our economic
responsibilities, we invite political
chaos and eventual
self-destruction.
