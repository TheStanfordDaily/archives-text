# Stanford-Cal — Still The Big Game
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
It's still the big game.
In recent years, it's been
common for Stanford fans,
especially younger ones, to smirk
at their rivals from Berkeley and
•,ay "we'd much rather beat USC
than you."
But as last year's 24-21 loss tc
Cal proved, and as this week's
antics (see page threei confirmed.
Stanford wants to beat California
just as much as the Bears want to
rub the Cards' noses into the turf.
Stanford, with a 6-4 record and
undefeated against teams not in
the nation's top 10. is a two
touchdown favorite over Cal.
which sports a modest 1-6 record.
But the Bears hav more than
just emotion going for them. The
team is loaded with talent,
especially on offense.
Top Runners
Running backs Chuck Muncie
and Howard Strickland rank with
the best in the nation. Muncie. a
sophomore tailback, combines 9.7
-.peed in the 100 with 228-pound
bulk to threaten defences both up
the middle and outside. His ability
to high jump 6-8 makes him
especially devastating near the
goal line, as evidenced by the fact
that he's scored 11 touchdowns.
Strickland is even faster (9.5).
and was a key reason why Cal
almost beat Washington State last
week. He gained 135 yards in only
1 1 carries, raising his season
average to 5.6 yards per try.
The Bears can also pass the
ball, and in fact are only 75 yards
short of the league-leading Cards
in that category, despite the fact
they've thrown 17 fewer passes.
Two QuarterbacKs
Cal coach Mike White has been
alternating quarterbacks Steve
Bartkowski. a senior, and Yince
Ferragamo. a sophomore, all
season. White has said he will not
"make a decision on who starts
until the ball is kicked off."
It was Ferragamo. who. as a
freshman last year, made the
winning touchdown throw to
Steve Sweeney as time ran out in
last vear's Big Game, won by Cal
24-21.
Stanford fans don't like to
admit that Cal actually beat the
Cards at the game of football. The
incredibly bad field conditions in
Berkeley made the game
"mudball." according to Farm
partisans.
Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen recently slung some
mud himself. Despite recent rains.
Chris said. "I don't see how we
could duplicate that (field
condition) unless we go out and
pla> somewhere in the Bay."
Lost Games
Whate\er the field condition.
Stanford's defense is certainly
talented enough to hold its own.
The Card defense is headed by th<
Par top-ranking defensive
secondarv. Seniors Randv Polll.

.Jim Kaffen. James Ferguson and
Craig Zaltosky will close out their
collegiate careers today.
Stanford also has a fine pair of
defensive ends. juniors Pat
Donovan and All-America Roger
Still well. Stillwel 1 "s reputation is
so manacing that enemy
ballcarriers usually run to
Donovan's side, and Donovan has
performed well enough to be
named "Northern California

Defensive Player of the Year."
Stanford's offense and Cal's
defense are generally considered
weaker than the teams' opposite
units, but both squads have
considerable talent.
The Cards' offense is led by
senior quarterback Mike Boryla.
the league's top passer and a solid
pro prospect. Boryla's favorite
receiver has been junior Bill
Singler. who has managed to catch

31 passes, including an incredible
touchdown grab last week against
Oregon.
Junior Scott Laidlaw leads an
increasingly-effective Stan lord
running game, but the team still
ranks last in the league's rushing,
as well as total offense, statistics.
Cal's defense likewise holds last
place. But that statistic is
certainly not caused by junior
tackle Rob Swenson. who has

recovered four fumbles and
sacked enemy quarterbacks four
times. Another standout is Ivan
Weiss, who leads the team with 57
tackles.
So both teams have the talent
to win this big game. And both
teams are emotionally ready.
In the stand-* today, insults and
maybe water balloons will fly.
The battle will be even more
fierce on the field.
