# Nervous Coaches Await Cage Opener
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Howie Dallmar, Bub Bowling
and Billy Jones are probably
fidgeting and squirming right now,
barely staying in their Stanford
Stadium seats. But it's nol the Big
Game that's making (hem nervous
their eyes may be on the
football field, but their minds are
on nearby Maples Pavilion, where
the Cards open their 1973-74
basketball season Friday night
against Nevada-Reno.
Actually, Dallmar, Bowling and
Jones have been fidgeting and
squirming since last March, when
Stanford closed out its most
successful season in six years with
a 70-66 victory over California.
Since then the three coaches have
anxiously awaited this Friday and
the opportunity to improve on
last year's 14-11 record.
"We're a year older and we've
got to be a year better," said
Dallmar, who begins his 20th
season as Stanford's head coach.
"We've got good depth and we're

playing with a lot of confidence."
The Cards have also displayed
the maturity of seasoned veterans,
especially in the person of junior
center Rich Kelley, Stanford's
first seven-footer and"the only
guy ever to step over the Great
Wall of China," according to
Stanford sports information
direc tor Bob Murphy.
Kelley spent last summer
playing with a United States
All-Star team in Red China and
came out of the experience "a
changed man." At least that's a
statement one basketball
magazine attributed to Kelley,
and oven though he insists he was
misquoted, he does admit that his
summer experience was beneficial.
Definite Improvement
"Playing with guys who should
be some of the best college
players in the country this year
definitely improved my game," he
said.
Last year Kelley averaged 17.3
points, grabbed a school record
331 rebounds and was a first team
All-Conference selection. This
season, with his collegiate and
China experience behind him, he
should be even better.
Kelley, though, is only one of
four giants on the Cardinal varsity
— five if you count 6-11 Dale
Peters, who will probably redshirt.
There's two-year starter Mike
Mann (6-9), a defensive standout
who developed his offensive skills
tremendously during the latter
part of last season, 6-11
sophomore Tim Patterson, who
shoots with the same feathery
touch of his older brother and
former UCLA star Steve, and
6-B'/i sophomore Ed Schweitzer.
Aggressiveness
Schweitzer, the leading scorer
on last year's junior varsity, has
been the biggest surprise. "We're
just going to have to find some

place to play him," said Dallmar,
complementing Schweitzer's
"aggressiveness and second and
third efforts. He knows what to
do with the ball around the
basket."
Mann, Patterson and
Schweitzer will probably share
time alongside Kelley in
Stanford's double-post offense,
with Dave Frost (6-6), Scott
Trobbe (6-7) and Melvin

Arterberry (6-3'/2) the leading
candidates for starting jobs at the
two wing positions.
Jim Montague (6-1), a "real
heady player," according to
Dallmar, has the inside track on
the starting spot at the point, with
returning starter Mark C.ilberg
(6-0) backing him up.
Substitute Freely
But Dallmar emphasizes that
his starting lineup won't really

mean much. "We'll play at least
nine guys," he said. "We use more
players than anybody in the
conference."
One of Stanford's greatest
strengths is its flexibility. At
times, the Cards will field a lineup
with three post men in the game
— at other times, three guards will
be on the floor. "There are a lot
of possibilities," Dallmar said.
"Guys like Trobbe and Arterberry
could play either as forwards or
guards defensively."
And besides the nine players
who figure most prominently
right now, there is a wealth of
explosive talent on the bench,
including guards Mike Simons and
Ben Bluitt and swing men Archie
Dean and Rich Wohlstadter.
All of which makes Dallmar,
Bowling and Jones as squirmy and
fidgety as ever.

POINT MAN—Guard Jim Montague plaved only sparingly as a junior
last season, as in the game against Washington State, but is expected
to start this season at the point position.
