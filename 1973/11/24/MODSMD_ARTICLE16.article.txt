# Outlook For Winter Sports Bright
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Contrary to popular opinion,
all athletic activity on the Farm
will not shift to Maples Pavilion
after today's game. During the
winter quarter many of the
athletes you are seeing on the turf
today will be participating in one
of the four winter sports.
Swimming
Stanford's swim team will hold
meets in the new $2.2 million
stadium this year.
The Cards will be considerably
stronger this year due to the
addition of several outstanding
freshman and junior college
transfers, despite the loss of Brian
.lob, NCAA record-holder in five
events. This year's swim team will
be weak in some areas, but there
will be a better total quality on
the team, with the sprint and
medley relay teams picked as the
top challengers for NCAA honors.
Martin Pedley will captain the
team. Pedley is a three year
All-American from Palo Alto. He
currently shares the NCAA and
American records in the 400
medley relay set by Stanford in
the 1971 NCAA Championships.
Joining Pedley as members of
Stanford's sprint relay team this
year will be the three other
members of last years NCAA
runnerup team in the 400 free
relay, All-Americans Dean
Anderson, Bruce Goodwin and
Richard Cook. Anderson won
gold and bronze medals in last
summer's World Games in
Moscow to establish himself as
one of swimming's top sprinters.
Other Events
Olympic gold medalist John
Hencken. national AAU champion
in the 200 individual medley, will
lead the breaststroke events for
the Cards. Helping out in the
breaststroke events will be
sophomores Bruce Craig and Dave
Easton. Backstroker Randy
Whitchurch,will be helped out this
vear by transfers Rick Gebers and
Jack Deppe. Freshman Brian
Roux gives Stanford a top
buttcrflier. Roux placed fifth in
the AAU Indoor Championships.
His performance in the 200 yard
butterfly will be a big factor in
Stanford's dual meet
performance.
Diving Coach Clyde Devine
welcomes back junior Rich
Rector, the seventh place finisher
in the one and three meter events
in last year's Pac-8 championships,
freshman Wayne Wagner. Tom
Pedreiru. Diane Cambell and Jill
Ward will also strengthen the
diving iorps this year.
Coach Jim Gaughrati is hanging
around with some fast company
these days. "We'll be in training
all the time for the NCAA
championship meet," said
Gaughran. The Pac 8 conference
boasts four of the top six teams in
last year's NCAA meet: USC,
UCLA, and Washington, as well as
Stanford.
The Stanford I mutationals,
Nov. .'{o and Dec. 1. will be the
opening event in the new pools.
With all the top teams entered this
promises to be an exciting debut.
Wrestling
While wrestling does not
attract the likes of Dick Enberg
and the TVS crew, this sport
could become a stellar attraction
on the Stanford campus. Coach
Joe De Meo said, "this year's
wrestling team could be the best
Stanford wrestling team ever.

Returning three-year letterman
Chris Horpel (150 pounds) and
Ken Krebs (142) will lead the
Cardinal squad. Horpel was an
All-American last year, placing
fifth in the NCAA Championships
as well as second in the Pac-8
Championships. The senior from
Newport Beach was voted
"California Wrestler of the Year"
and "Bay Area Wrestler of the
Year" last season.
Krebs, described by De Meo as
a "consistent winner" was one of
the co-captains of last year's
squad. He is considered one of the

"toughest wrestlers" Stanford has
ever had.
Emmett Stanton is another
Card who will be in the spotlight
this year. Stanton, last year's
"most improved wrestler," was a
Pac-8 place winner and an NCAA
qualifier. The two year letterman
will be wrestling at 158 pounds
this year. Bob Sweetman
"Certainly one of the best blind
wrestlers ever," according to
De Meo, will be returning this year
at 126.
Malcom Moos, a three year
letterman will be wrestling at 167

pounds. Last year's "Best
Freshman" award winner, John
Govea will be trying this year at
190 pounds.
"The freshman wrestlers are
the best e»"*r to come to
Stanford." said De.Wo Guard
Gary Anderson will put on
wresting ; ar alter the football
game today. Anderson was a 1973
California high school champion.
He will be wrestling in the
heavyweight division.
The season opens this Monday,
when Sonoma State and
Sacramento State face the Cards
in Encina Gym.
Gymnastics
Steve Hug, two time Olympian
and 1973 NCAA and Pac-8
Ail-Around champion, will lead
this year's gymnastics team. The
team will have depth and may be
a contender for top honors.
Second year Card mentor Sadao
Hamada has been working his
team seven days a week in
preparation for the season opener
in Sacramento State Invitational.
Hamada is an outstanding
gymnastic performer in his own
right. The 1969 graduate of
Nippon College in Japan is
experienced in international
competition and he guides his
team with his experience.
Other outstanding performers
on the team include Bob
Anderson and Shawn Skerrett,
who are the all-around specialists
on the team.
Howard Bessen and George
Negrete are the team's aces on the

rings. Ted Marcy is the
outstanding Card on the side
horse. Marcy just missed winning
the NCAA championships last
year as a freshman and he is
expected to win the title this year.
Rugby
Coach Pete Kmetovic's rugby
team might be mistaken for the
Cardinal football team, with Craig
Zaltosky, Eric Test, Forrie Martin
and Gordy Riegel playing. The
Cards figure to improve last year's
8-6-1 record. Three other Pac-8
teams field rugby teams — UCLA,
Cal and USC.
John Snyder, rated as a
break away threat by Kmetovic,
will be back this year. Bob
Hertenstein fills the important
kicker position.
In college football, schedules
are determined years in advance,
but as late as this week Kmetovic
was still uncertain about the
team's schedule.
There will be no conflict due
to football for the first time in
three years, so the rugby teamwill
be able to get in some early
practice. A ten-a-side
tournament will kick off the season
Dec. 1. Twenty teams will get
together in the event hosted by
Stanford for "a lot of playing and
some socializing over a keg," said
Kmetovic.
"Rugby is a player oriented
sport." said Kmetovic. The squad
will field four teams and the
teams' guidance will depend upon
the squad running the team, since
'Kmetovic is not able to run all
teams at all times.
