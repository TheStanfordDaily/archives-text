# JV Ends 4-1 Season, Stars To Aid Varsity
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Each pass that Mike Cordova
completed in leading Stanford's
junior varsity to a 4-1 season
record served as a reminder that
he, and a number of his
teammates, will be called upon to
fill vacant varsity spots next
season.
JV players, who will become
part of the pool which will fill
eight starting posts and two
kicking spots left by graduating
seniors, posted an impressive
reocrd for first-year head man
Gunther Cunningham.
Their season began on a ray of
hope which later turned out to be
their major disappointment.
Heavy underdogs against a
well-stocked UCLA squad,
Stanford held the Brubabes to a
12-6 halftime advantage and then
took the lead itself in the third
quarter when Cordova connected
on a 62-yard bomb to tight end
Dave Bruzzone and the PAT was
converted.
UCLA's Wishbone then started
to click, however, and by the help
of long gainers on the ground and
in the air, the Brubabes were back
on top, 24-13, within minutes.
So the game ended, but most
everyone in the Cardinal camp
considered the score a moral
victory. Cunningham was almost
overjoyed, and said his men "all
played well."
That was Friday. By early the
next week, Cunningham had seen
the game films and was seething.
He saw that his team had
outgained UCLA in total offense,
434-279 yards, but had dropped a
game which, he knew even then,
would cost the squad a perfect
season.
Redemption
Next week was redemption
week at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,
and before a morass of injuries
had curtailed the contest early,
Stanford had rolled up a 26-6 win.
The Cards had done so without
Cordova, who had moved up to
varsity after throwing for 280
yards against the Brubabes.
Two weeks later. Stanford was
in action again, hosting UC Davis.
Cordova was back, but neither he
nor the team was in the best of
form, and the favored Cards led
just 11 13 at the half.
UC Davis, however, turned the
ball over on five of its first six
plays of the second half. The Card
offense turned three of them into
touchdowns, and the game ended
a 41-21 runaway. Stanford rushers
had their finest day of (he season,
picking up 293 yards and three
touchdowns to complement
Cordova's three in the air.
Easy Win
In smoggy Los Angeles the
ensuing Friday, the JV
foreshadowed what was io occur
in the varsity encounter with USC
the next day. but the younger
Cards didn't stay close enough to
fall prey to any last-minute job.
Whet thev did do was absolutely

rout the proud Trobabes, 41-10,
with Cordova throwing five TD
passes and gaining 292 yards in
the air.
Scoring in every quarter, the
offense was helped by what
Cunningham called the defense's
finest performance of the season.
USC gained 283 total yards, but
the Card defenders managed to
stop the Trobabes from
touchdowns on 14 of 15 drives.
By now, amidst all the
celebration, the meaning of the
UCLA loss had set in.
Nevertheless, an enthused JV
ended its season with a 14-0
shutout of Cal at Berkeley last
week.
Playing under the sloppiest of
conditions on the muddy
Memorial Stadium field, Cordova
managed to direct the offense on
two scoring drives, running
himself for one TD and throwing
for the other. The defense
combined with the mud to
frustrate the Cal JV.
Talent For '74
And so the 4-1 record, together
with the 4-0 freshman campaign
of 1972 (the frosh and JV teams
were combined this season),
promises some talented young
footballers for Jack Christiansen
in 1974.
One would hope so. Although
the vacancies aren't as numerous as
in past years, some mighty big
shoes will have to be filled. The
departers, and the JVers who may
fill their spots, include:
-Mike Boryla, two-year
veteran QB and likely high pick in
the pro draft. Of course Cordova,
with his uncanny resemblance to
Jim Plunkett and a similar passing

knack, is the likely choice.
However, he must beat out Jerry
Waldvogel, who sparkled for the
frosh last season and sat out this
year, and Guy Benjamin, a
highly-recruited freshman whose
knee injury in pre-season practice
sidelined him for the year.
—Tight end Glen Stone.
Although Brad Williams is the
likely successor, Cunningham
coached two men, Barry Cernoch
and Bruzzone, who could
compete, although the latter has
still not recovered from a
mid-season injury.
—Running back Doug Jena.
Numerous possibilities from the
present varsity exist (including
freshman Ron Inge) so no JVer is
likely to start. Small, tough Tom
Oberhelman, quick Marvin
Holmes and bruising Greg Smith
all have a chance, though.
—Center Bill Reid. Here again
the current varsity should be able
to replenish itself with Rudy
Bergthold. JV center Ken
Shropshire, at only 200 pounds,
might have difficulty with big
middle linebackers.
—Defensive tackles Joe Martin
and Pete Hanson. Art Estrada
handled the job for the JV most
of the ye?r, and is already a good
varsity prospect for the one tackle
spot in the Cards' "50" defense.
—Defensive halfbacks Jim
Kaffen and James Ferguson, and
strong safety Randy Poltl. Here,
in the defensive secondary, is the
best opportunity for
advancement. Rich Waters and
Tom Lynn drew praise from
Cunningham after nearly every
game and are likely advancers.

—Punter Dave Ottmar. Lynn
had a brief stay with the varsity at
the season's start (Penn State,
Michigan), but wasn't up to par.
In five games with the JV he has
improved dramatically, once
kicking an 80-yard punt against
USC. He should start at punter.
—Place kicker Rod Garcia. His
feet have left big prints to follow,
but Chip Underwood provided a
sure foot for the JV. He made 15
of 19 extra points, and kicked
field goals of 44 and 43 yards.
Other Spots
Although varsity spots don't
open at their positions, other
JVers should contend.

Wide receivers Jim Jenke, Jim
Erickson, and Dave Nagler were
favorites with Cunningham all
season, both for their
pass-catching and for blocking.
Fullbacks Andy Kolesnikow
and Don Stevenson impressed the
coach with their blocking ability.
Kolesnikow. at 230 pounds, made
the varsity at the beginning of the
year.
Outside linebacker Mike
Yancey graduated to the varsity
early. Middle linebackers Mark
Sasina and John Olenchalk drew
frequent praise from Cunningham.
However, competition for varsjty
spots will be intense.

INSIDE TRACK—Quarterback Mike Cordova led the junior varsity
football team to three of its four wins this year, and appears to have
the best shot of replacing Mike Boryla as the Cards' quarterback next
season.
