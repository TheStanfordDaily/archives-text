# USC, UCLA Play For Pac-8 Crown
## 
### 
Barring an expensive transistor
TV. because you're at the
Northern California version of the
"Big Game" today, you won't be
able to see the more meaningful
Southern California version on
television.
USC and UCLA, both with
perfect 6-0 conference records,
square off at 1:30 in the battle to
see which team will become
Pacific Eight champion and meet
the winner of the earlier Ohio
State-Michigan game in the Rose
Bowl.
The Bruins are slight favorites
because of more impressive
victories over most common foes.
However, the Trojans have had
better luck in the series recently,
winning four and tying one of the
last six games played between the
teams at their common home
grounds. the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
UCLA leads the conference in
both scoring and total offense, the
Bruins relying heavily on the
Wishbone running of league-leader
Kermit Johnson and James
McAlister. USC's attack, led by
receiver Lynn Swann. has thus far
been somewhat less potent than
expected, but the team's strong
defense, ranking first in the
conference, has kept Troy from
falling except to unbeaten Notre
Dame.
Two other traditional-rivalry
games take place in the Northeast.
Washington State will forge its
second consecutive first-division
finish if it can beat Washington, a
team thus far undefeating in the
conference. The game will be
played at Seattle, and, as rumor
has it, could be the last of Jim
Owens, 17-year coaching career at
Washington.
Oregon State visits Oregon.
The Ducks are favored to rebound
from consecutive losses to
Washington State, UCLA and
Stanford to beat the Beavers, who
thus far have won only one
conference game.
If the favored teams —
Stanford. Oregon and Washington
State — all win today, the Pac-8
would become a perfectly ordered

league.
Even" team in the league would
have beaten every team below
them in the final standings and
lost to every team above them.
Thus, just by looking at the final
standings -- UCLA or USC first,
the other team second. Stanford
third, followed by Washington
State, Oregon. Cal. Oregon State
and Washington in that order —
you could find the result of every
one of the Pac-B's 28 conference
games.
