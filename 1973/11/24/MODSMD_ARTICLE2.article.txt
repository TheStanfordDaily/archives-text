# Cal Slowly Rebuilds Athletic Program
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The University of California athletic
program suffered quite a bit during the last
few years due to restrictions placed on the
school's teams by the NCAA. But. happily for
Golden Bear fans, the worst of it is over as
only the football squad remains penalized.
it didn't look too good for the blue and
gold two years ago when the NCAA stripped
the Bears of the National Collegiate track and
field title because they used an ineligible
sprinter.
Then came the penalties: the football team
first faced one season without an opportunity
to attend the Rose Bowl or play on national
or regional television, but after more
recruiting violations were discovered, this
restriction was extended for two years,
through next season.
The other fall sports: soccer, water poio
and cross country, faced two years with no
shot at a national title, and the remaining
athletic teams endured a similar one-year
penalty.
Dave Maggard. who took over the ominous
task of athletic director when the program
was on restriction, analy /.ed the situation that
developed from the penalties. They "h/uen't
had a positive effect." he admitted adding
that they weren't "completely negative"
either.
"We had one of the best \ ear

recruiting-wise." he claimed. "Students still
want to come here.''
Saturated Area
Maggard attributes the Bears' poor home
attendance this season to two factors: the
game results and the fact that the Bay Area is
"saturated with pro sports."
Football Coach Mike White approached his
job realistically when he took over the head
spot prior to the 1971 season. "I looked at it
as the kind of situation where it would take
three to five years to build a foundation. . . .
Some areas have been good.'' he stated, but in
others, "we are not where we wanted to be."
When White took the job. he thought the
squad would have to face only one year on
restriction. When the NCAA "tacked on two
additional years." White found himself
"dealing with a squad that had no place to
go."
The players were left without the "dream
of a Rose Bowl" as ultimate success, he said.
"They didn't ha\e the same goal" as players
on other squads, but they "were subjected to
the same pressure of the public to win or
lose. ... It makes it tough sometimes."
Still. White, who was an assistant coach to
John Ralston here before taking the lv ad job
at hi 1 - alma mater, realize- that he and the
tear; must "put up with the circumstances
and live with them."
1 hev will have to do lust that for another

year, and White is quite optimistic about the
immediate future. With many young players
forming the "nucleus." he hopes to shape a
contending team "within the next two years."
It's a different stor> for the water polo
team, which was favored to win the NCAA
title this weekend. If the poloists are
victorious at the Long Beach tournament, it
will be a long-awaited accomplishment.
Six players red-shirted (sat out one \ear)
during each of the last two seasons while the
team was on restriction.
Coach Pete Cutino recalls those two years
saving that he "never wants to go through
that again." With half the team in the water
and half the team out. and with "no shot to
go for" Cutino found the going "tough."
But this season Cutino has more
All-American-- than he can play at one time
and as a result, the Polo Bear compiled a 23-1
season mark which speaks for itself.
Cutino's only current problem, if you can
call it that, is that team members may be
"o\er-an\ious" after waiting a couple of extra
years to get a chance at the national title.
Will the ("a 1 football team be that anxious
after being on restriction three years'.' A lot of
Ciolden Bear rooters hope this v. ill be the case,
and awaiting one brilliant year that will
make them forget the frustrations of the
recent past.

it didn't look too good for the blue and
gold two years ago when the NCAA stripped
the Bears of the National Collegiate track and
field title because they used an ineligible
sprinter.
Then came the penalties: the football team
first faced one season without an opportunity
to attend the Rose Bowl or play on national
or regional television, but after more
recruiting violations were discovered, this
restriction was extended for two years,
through next season.
The other fall sports: soccer, water poio
and cross country, faced two years with no
shot at a national title, and the remaining
athletic teams endured a similar one-year
penalty.
Dave Maggard. who took over the ominous
task of athletic director when the program
was on restriction, analy /.ed the situation that
developed from the penalties. They "h/uen't
had a positive effect." he admitted adding
that they weren't "completely negative"
either.
"We had one of the best \ ear

recruiting-wise." he claimed. "Students still
want to come here.''
Saturated Area
Maggard attributes the Bears' poor home
attendance this season to two factors: the
game results and the fact that the Bay Area is
"saturated with pro sports."
Football Coach Mike White approached his
job realistically when he took over the head
spot prior to the 1971 season. "I looked at it
as the kind of situation where it would take
three to five years to build a foundation. . . .
Some areas have been good.'' he stated, but in
others, "we are not where we wanted to be."
When White took the job. he thought the
squad would have to face only one year on
restriction. When the NCAA "tacked on two
additional years." White found himself
"dealing with a squad that had no place to
go."
The players were left without the "dream
of a Rose Bowl" as ultimate success, he said.
"They didn't ha\e the same goal" as players
on other squads, but they "were subjected to
the same pressure of the public to win or
lose. ... It makes it tough sometimes."
Still. White, who was an assistant coach to
John Ralston here before taking the lv ad job
at hi 1 - alma mater, realize- that he and the
tear; must "put up with the circumstances
and live with them."
1 hev will have to do lust that for another

year, and White is quite optimistic about the
immediate future. With many young players
forming the "nucleus." he hopes to shape a
contending team "within the next two years."
It's a different stor> for the water polo
team, which was favored to win the NCAA
title this weekend. If the poloists are
victorious at the Long Beach tournament, it
will be a long-awaited accomplishment.
Six players red-shirted (sat out one \ear)
during each of the last two seasons while the
team was on restriction.
Coach Pete Cutino recalls those two years
saving that he "never wants to go through
that again." With half the team in the water
and half the team out. and with "no shot to
go for" Cutino found the going "tough."
But this season Cutino has more
All-American-- than he can play at one time
and as a result, the Polo Bear compiled a 23-1
season mark which speaks for itself.
Cutino's only current problem, if you can
call it that, is that team members may be
"o\er-an\ious" after waiting a couple of extra
years to get a chance at the national title.
