# 74-Year Battle For Axe Still Rages
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A great blow for justice,
private property, and the
American way was struck earlier
this week. The Axe came back to
Stanford.
It would have been coming
back this afternoon after the game
anyway, of course, but it is only
just that the Axe should be back
on the Farm as early as possible.
After all, it's Stanford's Axe.
Over the years Berkeley
partisans have stolen the Axe a
number of times; Stanford has
always tried to bring it back
where it belonged. And most
Stanford fans would certainly
agree that the Cardinals were
robbed of the Axe last year in the
memorable Mud Bowl at Cal.
The story of the Axe's newest
journey is certainly one that will
be told and retold at Stanford pep
rallies for years to come; it's
almost as great a tale as the
original Berkeley theft and
Stanford's revenge 31 years later.
The heroes of this particular
liberation of the Axe are already
widely known as the "Infamous
Three" of Theta Delta Chi
fraternity. For four months they
plotted in smoke-filled rooms and
back alleys, conniving to restore
honor to the Farm.
Little To Lose
"Except for some jail time we
had nothing to lose," one of the
conspirators told the Daily. "I
mean it had only been 30-odd
years since the last theft; and the
Axe was only encased in a nuclear
attack-proof case with an alarm
system; and what should it matter
if it was Big Game week and the
Axe was the center of attention
for the entire community?"
In classic con-man style, one of
the Theta Delts called the Cal
student union, and imitated Bear
Coach Mike White's voice. A wire
service photographer wanted to
photograph White holding the
Axe at a football writer's banquet
at Ming's restaurant in Palo Alto;
could he come by Tuesday
morning with two football players
and pick it up?
"Why, certainly you can,
Coach," the naive (or maybe just
stupid) officials replied.
Later that morning "Coach
White" called again. He would be
delayed, and couldn't come for
the Axe. Couldn't his two players
pick it up? Why certainly they
can, Coach.
Minor Hitch
Things didn't work perfectly,
though; when the two "players"
— fully equipped with Cal letter
jackets — showed up, the Axe
wasn't there. The Cal Rally
Commission had removed it from
the student union earlier in the

week to make sure that nothing
like this would happen.
Now the student union
manager became an unwitting (or
witless) accomplice to the plan.
He called the Rally Commission,
explained the problem, and got
them to produce the Axe. There
was a hitch, though; they insisted
on going along — and they
demanded that the Axe make the
ride to Palo Alto in their car.
Men of less dedication,
intelligence, moral caliber, and
gall might have given up at this
point. But the Infamous Three are
made of stronger stuff. The two
"football players" quickly agreed
to lead the way to Palo Alto; then
they sent "Coach White" to a
phone booth with his last dime to
call the frat house at Stanford.
New Man
The plan now was to have
reinforcements wait in the parking
lot at Ming's, where the football
banquet was taking place. There
they would jump the four Cal
guards and return the Axe to its
rightful owner. But again it
looked like things wouldn't work
out.
"As we drove in, our hearts
sank," the group's spokesman
said. "No cars, no guys ... it was

going to be four on two . . . and
then we saw two familiar faces at
the end of the parking lot." The
reinforcements were there.
The two "football players"
suggested that they be allowed to
carry the Axe into the banquet.
As soon as one of them got his
hands on it, he sprinted away with
the 50-pound plaque. A flying
tackle pinned him to the hood of
a Cadillac, the Axe bounced up
onto the car's roof, and suddenly
Theta Delts were all over the
place.
The Axe was back.
Past History
The caper brought back
memories of how the Axe was
born, how it first made its way to
Berkeley, and how the Immortal
21 recovered it in a blaze of glory.
Billy Erb — whose place in
Stanford history' is secure, if not
altogether comprehensible —
forged the Axe in 1899. Erb, a
yell leader, hoped to bolster the

spirits of the Stanford baseball
team in the Big Series with Cal.
His idea of spirit was a little
strange, to say the least. He used
the Axe to beheada dummy bear
and chop up blue and gold
ribbons during the game, and
brandished it ominously at the Cal
band.
After the game — which
Stanford lost — a large group of
Cal men jumped the guardians of
the Axe (including Carl Harden,
later U.S. Senator from Arizona)
and took it away. In a frantic race
to the ferry, the Axe changed
hands several times as the two
groups threw it back and forth.
But finally Cal managed to sneak
it across the Bay.
Unsuccessful Tries
Stanford men raided the Cal
campus several times in an
attempt to recover the stolen
property; once they even braved a
Berkeley football player
brandishing an army sword. But

they could never find the Axe.
In 1930, God finally smiled on
Stanford. The Immortal 21 posed
as newspaper photographers at a
Cal pep rally. The egotistical
Berkeley freshmen were eager to
get their pictures in the paper, but
when the camera went off, tear
gas and smoke bombs exploded all
over the Axe. Howard Avery
snatched the Axe. and a rented
Hertz car zipped them back to
campus.
Stanford went wild. Classes
were canceled for two days,
everyone partied well into the
night, and the Immortal 21 were
awarded Block S letters, the
highest tribute for a Stanford
student. Three years later, in a
shocking betrayal, the Stanford
administration agreed to make the
Axe a trophy for the winner of
the annual Big Came.
But now the Axe is back. And
the Immortal 21 can make room
for the Infamous Three.
