# Pro Scouts Eye Graduating Seniors
## 
### STAN WILSON JIM WASCHER 
All pro quarterback John
Brodie did it; Heismann Trophy
winner Jim Plunkett is doing it;
and All American Mike Boryla
will almost surely do it next year.
Former Stanford great John
Brodie announced his retirement
from pro football effective at the
end of the season, but he
established a precedent for
greatness at the quarterback
position that Plunkett continued
at the Farm and took with him
into the professional ranks.
Plunkett, perhaps the greatest
quarterback in the history of
collegiate football, is now making
his mark in the pros with the
struggling New England Patriots.
Then along comes Mike Boryla,
with an arm like a cannon and the
physical stature and poise to make
him a potential first round pick in
the professional draft next
February. Boryla played in the
shadows of Rose Bowl heroes Don
Bunce and Plunkett for two
seasons before coming into his
own last year.
Chicago Bears scout Dan
Stefan says, "There is no doubt in
my mind that Boryla will be a
first round draft choice. He's
improved steadily throughout the
year and that's what you look for
— how good a guy can become."
Boryla has already become
very good. He lofted a record five
touchdowns against Washington
State a month ago, and had three
more against Oregon last week
raising his season total to 17, only
three behind Plunkett's record of
20. Boryla has amassed 3998
passing yards in his career to rank
him second behind Plunkett on
the list of Stanford greats. But
Boryla won't catch Plunkett
today unless he sends the football
on a world cruise — Plunkett
threw for four and a half miles
during his collegiate career.
"He's going to be one of the
first quarterbacks picked in the
pro draft," predicted receivers
coach Pete Kettela. "He offers

what many quarterbacks around
the country oan't. We don't
straight-jacket him into set plays
as a good many schools do with
their quarterbacks."
Kettela also said that
punter-reserve quarterback Dave
Ottmar has "got a chance in the
pro's, if not to be drafted, to be
taken as a free agent." Ottmar is
one of the top punters in the
conference with an average of
41.5 yards per kick. He is also a
fine quarterback with a good arm,
and is a very capable runner.
When quarterbacks Ottmar and
Boryla fail to move the ball to the
goal line, all they have to do is get
it inside the 50 yard line and the
leading scorer in Stanford history
is within range.

Whether he's missing field goals
and extra points against San Jose
State or winning Rose Bowls with
last second kicks, Rod Garcia has
provided excitement to Stanford
football for three years.
Kettela expects that the pros
will draft Garcia high, saying
"anybody that needs a kicker
would look at him in the first
rounds." Fro scouts have certainly
taken note of Garcia's range (his
longest field goal was 59 yards)
and his improved consistency (he
has made 16 of 25 field goals
attempted).
The only other senior on the
offense whom Kettela thinks has a
chance of playing in the pros is
running back John Winesberry,
who has been plagued by injuries
throughout his collegiate career.
Kettela said Winesbcrry's pro
prospects as a wide receiver
depend upon his recovery from
knee surgery earlier this season.
Team surgeon Fred Behling
expects Winesberry to recover
fully.
In evaluating the defense,
Kettela said pro scouts had looked
at both strong safety Randy Pol 11
and halfback James Ferguson.
Poltl was a pre-season favorite for
Ail-American honors, but Kettela
said "the pro scouts aren't sure
whether they're going to go with
Randy."
Kettela said Ferguson "has the
speed which would justify the
pros taking a chance on him."
Ferguson and Poltl make up one
half of the best defensive
secondary in the conference.

THE LAST TIME- Mike Boryla, who holds second spot behind Jim
Flunkett in many of Stanford's passing statistics, plays his last game in
a Cardinal jersey today. But Boryla's football career probably hasn't
ended, as he'll almost certainly be a high professional draft choice.

FINEST HOUR—Safety Randy Poltl (36) makes one of his 14 tackles
that helped Stanford beat Michigan 13-12 in the 1972 Rose Bowl.
Poltl, then a sophomore, plays his last game for Stanford today, but
could be playing in a pro football uniform next season.
