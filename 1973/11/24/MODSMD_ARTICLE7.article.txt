# Hang-Loose Riegel Protects Individuality
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Gordy Riegel is the football
player who tests the sincerity of
the statements the Stanford
athletic department makes about
welcoming athletes who don't go
along with conventional
standards.
He plays rugby in the
off-season, and prefers it to
football. He missed spring practice
last year so he could attend
Stanford-in-Germany. Earlier this
year, he overslept and missed the
plane to the Illinois game. He
doesn't live the fraternity lifestyle
popular among football players
and he doesn't hesitate to criticize

things lie doesn't like.
Like him or not, the coaches
have to go along with Riegel. It's
hard to say "get lost" to a 6-5,
220 pound inside linebacker who
usually plays well and
occasionally — as against USC and
Illinois this year — plays
brilliantly.
The USC game two weeks ago
provides an example of Riegel's
unorthodox thinking.
"I went out there with the idea
that I wanted to stop Anthony
Davis. I also wanted to prove
three things — that USC is not a
Number One team, that we're as
good as they are, and I wanted to

win.
"After the game, some guys
were throwing things around, but
I couldn't have been mad. I
walked off the field with my eyes
closed saying 'two out of three.' "
Riegel didn't need any coaches'
exhortations to get him
emotionally ready for the USC
game, when he stopped Davis and
earned "defensive player of the
game" honors.
"When a coach tries to get me
excited, saying 'c'mon kill,' I say
'hey man, relax, its only a game.'
"Some of the other coaches
put a lot of pressure on Chris
[Head Coach Jack Christiansen]
to be more 'rah-rah,' and he does
yield to some of that pressure... .
"Rugby's a game, which is the
way football should be. You see
your opponent drinking beer at a
party after the game. You see
more of a person than just a
machine you're playing against as
in football," Riegel says.
In keeping with his philosophy,
Riegel, when selected defensive
captain after the Illinois game,
succeeded in getting the defensive
team to give up all goals for itself
except victory. "I guess that was
before the UCLA game," he says,
and laughs ironically (Stanford lost
59-13). "But really, its been
better since we gave up setting
goals."
Riegel may not believe in goals,
but he does have a few ambitions
for next year, his final season
(he's a senior now, but reluctantly
redshirted a year).
"I guess I'd like to be elected
captain next year," he says,
referring to the annual election of
captains for the season before the
Cal game. "I'd like to win some
sort of national honors. I hope to
be drafted by some pro team. As a
team, we want to go to the Rose
Bowl ... I think that's very

realistic."
After that, Riegel ambivalently
looks forward to pro football. "I
never like to say, 'yeah, I'd like to
go into pro football' because that
would tell me something about
myself I don't like. But there's a
lot of money involved and it
might set me up for something
later outside pro football."
With 4.7 speed in the 40, and a
knach for reading guards' moves
and pursuing runners ("I have my
best games when the other team
runs from sideline to sideline
because I read and pursue best")
Riegel seems suited for a career as
a professional middle linebacker.
But that's not the only career he
could embark upon.
"I started as a pre-med, then
was a music major, in between I
had some psychology. Now I'm in
anthropology and photography.
I'm not definitely counting on
grad school, then I'd have to
commit myself, just as I'm not
counting on pro football."
Riegel added to his versatile
education by going to Europe. "In

Europe, with all the different
nations, people are more
conscious of nationalities. In
America, you're psychologically
isolated, so you don't have that
many types of people to derive
your individuality from."
But Riegel hasn't found it
difficult to become an individual.
He lives in the basement of a
house off-campus, having paneled
the cement walls. Still, it's a
basement, and he has a water
heater in his room as well as a
waterbed.
Among his wall hangings is a
Soviet flag "collected" in
Czechoslovakia. He and his
house-mates are not exactly
examples of the most clean-cut
way of life.
His "hang-loose" lifestyle
conflicts with others on the team
(for example, "Jesus freaks"), and
Riegel sees a problem of unity
facing the team. "With all the
diverse groups on the team the
coaches have a problem treating
them ail equally," he says, and
characteristically launches into a
frank (but off-the-record)
discussion of the problem.
