# City Council Proposes Controls For University's Building Policy
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night voted 7-2 to pass a proposal
recommending to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors that
Stanford be forced to consult with
Palo Alto before developing certain
University lands.
The Council asked that the
proposed Santa Clara County City
Services (CS) Zoning Ordinance
require Stanford to submit an
environmental impact report to Palo
Alto prior to doing any building in the
arboretum and athletic fields along El
Camino Real, in a strip of land along
Willow Road between Pasteur Drive
and Junipero Serra Boulevard, or in
the Frenchman's Terrace region.
The "cs" ordinance, if passed by
the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, would require areas
bordering municipalities to seek
annexation to a city before making
any improvements on the land.
Naphtali Knox, Palo Alto city
planning director, recommended that
Stanford be forced to follow
annexation requirements of the
proposed ordinance prior to starting
any new construction on campus. At a
meeting two weeks ago, Knox stated
that Stanford's past record of good
planning does not insure that the
University will continue to plan
conscienciously. Palo Alto should be
given the veto power over all campus

improvements, he argued.
In response to Knox's contention,
Robert R. Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
wrote a letter to the Palo Alto City
Council in which he stated that
Stanford provides its own municipal
services and should be exempt from
the proposed "cs" zone requirements.
In an effort to reconcile the views
of Knox and Augsburger, Palo Alto
City Councilman Stanley Norton
proposed a compromise that would
require Stanford to submit an
environmental impact report to Palo
Alto for certain regions adjacent to the
city. Palo Alto would then prepare
another report. If the second report
stated that the University project had
no detrimental impact, then Stanford
could proceed in obtaining a building
permit from the county.
The City Council last night again
heard Knox argue for more stringent
control by Palo Alto over Stanford's
development and University officials
object to any formal controls. The
Council then voted to accept the
Norton compromise with one
amendment.
The amendment, proposed by Vice
Mayor Enid Pearson, added the
Frenchman's Terrace region to the
areas subject to Palo Alto consultation
regarding improvements.
By accepting the Norton plan, the
Council rejected the Palo Alto City

Planning Commission's proposal —
"ammendment six" — which would
have made development of Stanford's
academic lands subject to control by
Palo Alto.
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum
offered a motion that placed the Palo
Alto Citj Council on record as
opposing any extension of the "cs"
zone in the future to include academic
lands. The proposal passed 8-1.
John Beahrs said, "I don't think
politicians should tell a major
institution what to do academically."
Beahrs argued that Stanford should be
trusted to plan future developments
properly without the interference of
the Palo Alto City Council.
Norton, however, contended that as
a Stanford alumni he is concerned
with the interests of the University,
but did not see how the proposal
could possibly interfere with academic
freedom. He pointed out that one of
the areas affected by his plan is a golf
course and there is no indication that
it will ever be used for other purposes.
Another area that would be affected is
a strip of land bordering the Stanford
hospital and, he said that Palo Alto
should be consulted regarding future
there because the hospital is a profit
making institution. No purely
academic regions would be affected,
he insisted.
But Councilman John Berwald,
who cast one of two dissenting votes

against the Norton compromise
argued, "This represents a philosophy
of resolving conflict by domination
rather than by voluntary cooperation.
We should try for an agreement that is
acceptable to both Palo Alto and the
University."
Prior to the vote on the Norton
proposal, Executive Assistant to the
Provost Edward Shaw read to the
Council a letter from President
Richard Lyman which urged further
negotiation.
In the letter, Lyman offered to
establish a mechanism which would
enable Stanford to inform Palo Alto of
future academic projects. The city
would be given an opportunity to ask
questions and to make suggestions that
Stanford would attempt to
accomodate.
