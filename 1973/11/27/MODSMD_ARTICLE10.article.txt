# Economic Gain
## Ad Policy Impact 
### 
* Jim Sullivan

Rich Jaroslovsky invokes high
journalistic principles to
rationalize the Daily's patently
hypocritical policy of running ads
for Gallo wine while supporting
the UFW boycott in its editorials.
He views the farmworker struggle
with Gallo as an issue about which
"reasonable men may differ," and
he claims that the Daily runs
Gallo ads as a part of its
responsibility to provide an equal
opportunity for both sides to
present their views. This is good
liberal and quasi legal rhetoric,
but let's be realistic.
The most important
journalistic principle requires that
a newspaper provide first hand
investigative reports' by skeptical
and aggressive reporters, so that it
can help its readers make a
reasoned judgment on whether to
support the boycott. The Daily
has ignored this responsibility: it
fills its pages with AP and UPI
reports, and guest columns.
It should give the readers
information about the way Gallo
tried to drive striking farmworkers
out of their labor camp homes by
poisoning their water and shutting
off their electricity, about the
brutal working conditions in the
fields, about the collusion
between Gallo and Teamster
officials to deny farmworkers
their basic right to choose their
own union. If the Daily were
serious about its standards of
journalism and provided this type
of information, it could not claim
that this is an issue about which
reasonable men might differ.
The Daily claims that it
promotes public dialogue on this
issue by running Gallo ads. As if
these ads provided a substantive
discussion of the issues involved in
the boycott. In fact, the only
informational content of the ads
is that Gallo makes pink chabli.
Communication Attempt
Jaroslovsky raises the spector
of censorship, and points out how
outraged people would be if the
Daily refused to run an ad
supporting the farmworkers. But
the farmworkers are not trying to
sell a product. They are
attempting to communicate the
facts of their situation and the
critical nature of the struggle to

people who can help them.
Moreover, the farmworkers do
not have money for an advertising
barrage like Gallo's. This fact is
critical. Selling advertising space
to the highest bidder has nothing
to do with promoting informed
dialogue and democratic
decision-making. It only advances
the interests of the powerful
corporations by ignoring or
obscuring the issues. The Daily
should not see its function as
protecting the markets of large
corporations. This is not
journalism.
Let's consider the real
motivation for carrying the ads,
and the real impact these ads
have. The Gallo ads come from a
national student newspaper
advertising service which provides
sizeable revenues to the newly
independent Daily. Now, the
Daily and other student
newspapers have two choices.
They can accept the ads and the
money they provide, or they can
join together with other student
newspapers and demand that the
service stop carrying these Gallo
ads until Gallo recognizes the wish
of the majority of the workers in
their fields to be represented by
the UFW.
University Market
Does this matter'? It certainly
does. University students buy the
bulk of Gallo wine. To resist the
UFW boycott, Gallo must
maintain its university market by
saturating campuses with Gallo
advertising. The boycott is the
farmworkers' primary economic
weapon in their struggle against
gross economic exploitation: its
success on campus will decide
whether the growers will come to
terms with the farmworkers or
continue to exploit them.
The Daily proclaims its support
of the UFW at the same time it
helps Gallo sell its wine at
Stanford, all in the name of free
speech. If the Daily insists on
prostituting itself by pushing
Gallo wine, it should admit its
crass veniality and stop hiding
behind the smokescreen of
responsible journalism.
