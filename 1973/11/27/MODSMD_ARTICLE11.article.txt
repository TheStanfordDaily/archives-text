# Chilean Students Remain Silent
## Junta Prevents Opposition

The recent series of articles in support of the
Chilean military Junta by Chilean students Raul
Vinuela and Bruno Philippi is an outstanding
example of the style of journalism practiced in that
unfortunate country since September 11.
At the outset the authors disqualify all that has
been said or written at Stanford against the Junta
by calling it "at best foolish and uninformed if not
devious in nature." Next they try to disqualify any
potential counterarguments by saying that it takes a
long time to fully understand what is really going on
in a country whereas our local authorities on Chile
are "summer vacation experts."
Having thus paved their way by using the above
covert invocation of their authority, they go on
describing the evils of Allende's government without
giving any evidence for such bold statements as:
that the death toll was "far less than in the feverish
nightmares of Newsweek's Barnes," that the
workers' share in wages and salaries actually
decreased during Allende's tenure (his followers
claimed the contrary), and, the boldest, that
Allende and his government smuggled into Chile
heavy equipment for an illegal army of 20,000
people in the development of which 13,000
foreigners were helping.
At the end of the two-part series, the authors
belittle once more the local foes of the Junta as
"people who never try to understand the facts and
react furiously when they discover that reality does
not fit their abstract ideological molds" (another
covert invocation of their authority!).
Finally, they try to give themselves a liberal
semblance by deploring what everybody deplores,
namely the death of people and of democracy, and
by saying that they do not feel a military
government is the perfect solution but that it was
the only alternative. This countenance will fool only
those who do not know that the Junta leader
General Pinochet has said exactly the same; as a
matter of fact, there is not a single concept in
Vinuela and Philippi's article to which the Junta
would not wholeheartedly subscribe.
The Daily has accepted their article for
publication because it wants to be a forum where all
opinions can be presented. However, the very spirit
of the article, as it is manifest in its wording,
violates this good intention; for the authors know
very well — although many Americans may not be
fully aware of this — that those potential opponents
of their views who are not just "summer vacation

experts" on Chile, namely more than half the
Chilean students at Stanford, cannot dare answer
them publicly unless they do not intend to ever see
their country"again and do not have families in Chile
who could be harassed because of their views and
are furthermore certain that they will be admitted
to stay in the U.S. if their passports were to be
revoked in retaliation by the Chilean Junta.
These Chilean students will have to swallow their
bitterness and despair in face of the fact that those
Chileans who have nothing to fear because they
support the Junta find an open forum from which
to present to the American people "the view of
those who really understand Chile." They will have
a hard time trying to understand in the name of
which freedom the Daily lends itself to this abuse.
The Junta has started an offensive to improve
their image in the Western world and especially in
the U.S. Part of this was the propaganda tour by
three representatives of the Chilean Armed Forces
who recently came to San Francisco. Let us be
aware that this offensive will increase its intensity
while we shall have little opportunity to hear the
many Chileans who oppose this brutal late sprout of
fascism, seasoned with the xenophobia which
characteristically goes hand in hand with it.
To have an idea of how large this forcedly silent
majority may be, let us say that the conservative
weekly news magazine "Ercilla" published in its
edition of August 22-28, 1973, the results of an
opinion poll in a middle class suburb of Santiago:
12.5 percent favored a military coup while 56.5
percent opposed it, 18 percent refused to answer
any question at all and the rest did not answer the
question on the coup.
There is a real danger that elements like the
authors of that article will be able to misuse our
liberality to obtain a forum for their propaganda for
a system which denies, in fact if not in words, our
democratic ideals, and that they will try to impose
on us their views by invoking their authority on a
country which, we must confess, we scarcely know.
Many uncritical people may be sensitive to that sort
of argument. Unfortunately, it seems we cannot do
anything to prevent this happening without running
counter our very principles. Let us, at least, make
them feel our repudiation when they do so.
