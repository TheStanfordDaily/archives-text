Eviction Protested
Editor:
As single graduate students
living in Escondido Village, we
protest the planned eviction and
shuffling of single students from
their residences into the vacated
"empty" apartments of other

students during the period
between Dec. 15 and Jan. 4.
Contrary to the opinion of
housing administrator Alan
Cummings (Daily, Nov. 21), the
Escondido Village apartments are
home to a majority of single
graduate students. In this respect,
we are no different from married
students, who are not being asked
to leave.
About 50 percent of us are
foreign students and most of the
remainder come from distant
states. Furthermore, graduate
students usually have research
projects which do not terminate
at quarter's end.
There are several personal
inconveniences raised by the
proposed plan, Including the
following:
1. No concrete provisions for
the protection of personal
property have been made by the
administration. These provisions
should include the safeguarding of
mail and protection against
unauthorized long-distance
telephone calls as well as damage
or theft.
2. Students being temporarily
moved out of their apartments
would lose valuable study time
during finals week packing and
transferring their possessions.
3. If graduate students are
moved into dormitories, they will
lose their kitchen facilities and
will have to spend much more
money eating out.
While we sympathize with the
problems Stanford faces in the
current fuel shortage, we consider
the present administrative plan in
regard to single graduate student
housing to be poorly formulated.
The students affected were not
consulted nor were any of the
above problems considered. We
were not even legally notified.
Before being forced to go
through these inconveniences, we
think the University should give
us a building-by-building estimate
of their expected fuel savings.
Perhaps an even greater fuel
savings could be achieved through
more equitable measures affecting
all University buildings (e.g. a
uniform temperature reduction to
66-68Â°). Since, to quote the
office of the Dean of Housing,
"we must all make sacrifices at
this time," perhaps they would
institute a "take-a-student-home
for-vacation" program.

Clerical Partisanship
Editor:
Given the political uses to
which the Internal Revenue
Service appears to have been put

in recent years, there is doubtless
a prudential argument for halting
the use of Memorial Chapel as an
information center for the
presidential impeachment
movement. Undoubtedly such
partisanship is in addition an
embarrassment to an institution
that must go regularly to the
Feds, cap in hand, seeking
millions in funding without which
the University would find itself
poorer but not appreciably more
virtuous or independent.
Be that as it may, the
statements attributed to the
University administration imply
that the Dean of the Chapel's
partisanship was not only
imprudent but wrong. President
Lyman is alleged to have claimed
that Dean Kelly's actions were in
error because "a university church
has an obligation to represent all
points of view."
While it is easy to believe that
there are, as President Lyman is
reported to have said, "plenty of
people who would question
whether that is the proper activity
of the church," does it necessarily
follow that it is the task of the
church to countenance or express
every opinion or conviction?
Last week the Archibishop of
Canterbury made a small headline
by condemning the latest atrocity
of the South African regime. It is
conceivable that some Tory will
criticize the Archbishop for
failing to support a white
supremacist regime, but one
doubts that a demand will be
made that, as primate of the
Church of England, the
Archbishop must represent all
points of view.
Christians, like others, have
undoubtedly espoused the wrong
cause on many occasions; in fact,
since Christians have appeared on
all sides of many issues, it is likely
that they have not all interpreted
God's will, or the Gospels, or the
Holy Spirit correctly. However,
the Dean of the Chapel was
criticized not for being mistaken
but for being partisan. Surely the
injunction to give the devil his due
does not mean that his cause must
be championed in Memorial
Church, or does it?
Paul Seaver
Recycling Policies
Editor:
The Daily recently quoted Mr.
DeYoung as saying that the
present fuel oil shortage is both a
"problem and an opportunity."
TTiis letter is to encourage you to
make the most of the opportunity
now, instead of at the last possible
moment
Many prominent scientists,
including Paul Ehrlich, and most
recently on campus, Robert
North, have warned that this
country is consuming resources at
a rate far greater than the earth

and technology can sustain. The
recent shortages of many goods,
including petroleum, strongly
indicate that they are right.
Fortunately, there are measures
that we can take that will
substantially relieve demands on
our natural resources while
causing us only minimal
inconvenience.
The recycling of materials in
manufactured products, however,
have a significant impact only if
the public and institutions like
Stanford provide leadership and
encouragement. Now that we are
faced with an "energy crisis," the
time is ripe for a concerted effort
to organize individuals and
institutions so that they can easily
recycle many goods, and, thereby,
relieve the pressure on our limited
resources.
As a first step, Stanford should
allow only returnable bottles to
be sold on campus, because the
reuse of bottles requires less
energy than the recycling of
aluminum cans and also does not
contribute to the depletion of our
limited metal supply. Numerous
convenient recycling stations
should be established for the
return of bottles (and
newspapers).
Second, due to the increasing
demand for recycled paper, it may
be economical for the university
to collect and sell "waste" paper.
Costs could be kept down in the
collection of used and discarded
paper with the cooperation of the
Stanford community in keeping
paper segregated from other
garbage.
Third, I have been informed by
STORES that they do not carry
recycled paper, due to "cost and
availability" problems and the
Press has to special order this type
of paper. Only our efforts will
decrease the cost of recycled
paper and as for availability,
recycled paper can be obtained in
Palo Alto, as well as many other
places. At a minimum, the
University should have a policy of
using only stationery made from
recycled paper.
Fourth, the stocking of
polystyrene cups by STORES
should be stopped because they
are non-biodegradable, lasting
essentially forever in the
environment. Furthermore, when
burned, they emit extremely
noxious gases. Everyone in this
University should use paper cups
and preferably ones constructed
of recycled paper.
I hope you will take advantage
of this opportunity and help
establish a more rational
consumptive policy for Stanford
University. At the very least, I ask
that you establish a
student-faculty-employee
committee to consider my and
other recommendations on a
timely basis.
Hilary H. Lash
Secretary to the Dean
