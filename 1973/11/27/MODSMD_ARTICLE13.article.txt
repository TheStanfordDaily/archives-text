# Choreography Clouds Pacific Ballet Opener
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
SAN FRANCISCO—The Pacific Ballet unveiled three modern
ballets by artistic director/choreographer John Pasqualetti at its
season opener Friday night in a three-fourths full Veterans
Auditorium. Despite the commendable efforts of two featured
dancers, ambiguous choreography left the audience wondering what
the instrospective writhing on stage was all about.
Rhapsody In Blue, hailed in the program as a pas de deux tribute
to composer George Gershwin and "American life, love, and funk,"
received an enthusiastic five-minute ovation.
Most of the enthusiasm was generated by the crisp charisma of
Carolyn Goto, who delivered clean-cut, inspired technique throughout
a test-piece that would have tried the endurance of a channel
swimmer. Goto's uncanny flexibility was as evident as her strength in
a succession of supported splits. With a little help from her partner's
shoulder, she hyperextended more than once beyond the 180-degree
mark.
But her interpretation of the Rhapsody left no doubt that Goto
appreciates the potential dramatic impact of even a 45-degree
extension. She moved as a creature of the music itself, blending sharp
fluidity in softer interludes with the hot, vampy moves of a temptress
in the more seductive passages.
Andrew Woodd's strength complemented Goto's crispness

throughout the work. But Pasqualetti's self-conscius choreography
mired him in the introspective type of male role best exemplified by
Erik Bruhn's prince in the lastest version of Swan Lake.
Woodd's psychological contortions seemed pointless. At least Swan
Lake's prince has an elusive Swan Queen to search for.
Rhapsody was sandwiched between two other new works that
should be quickly forgotten or completely restructured.
Nearly Nude Apollo
Friday's night's audience was relatively devoid of the pre-teenage
would-be ballerinas who provide entertainemnt at most dance
performance intermissions by self-importantly parading up and down
the aisles. But even the older crowd reacted with a mixture of gasps
and giggles when the curtains opened to reveal a near-nude Greek god
in Apollo.
After recovering from the shock of John Loschmann's apparant
lack of any costume except a dubious loincloth, the audience
continued to gasp at the dancer's rippling interpretation of Apollo's
birth, set to the music of Stravinsky.
Apollo started off at the heights of Olympus, but quickly rolled
downhill as Pasqualetti's monotonous choreography dragged on
endlessly.
Loss of Innocence
The entrance of three shaky nymphs didn't do much to enliven the
scene. Aided by the stiff, alabaster beauty of nymph Emily Wenk,
Apollo lost his innocence long after the audience had lost its patience.
A shorter version of Apollo would allow the audience to appreciate
Loschmann's breathtaking interpretation and the stunning lighting

effects without being sidetracked by the tiresome cavorting of the
nymphs. In its present form, the audience becomes too tired or bored
to give a fine soloist the enthusiastic recognition he deserves.
Brahms Songs opened the program with a concentration of the
choreographic flaws that plagued all three ballets. Even Goto's vitality
was submerged in the work's utter lack of purpose.
The Pacific Ballet gives a bouquet of roses to the female leads of
each ballet during curtain calls. The fact that soprano Francesca Howe
received the flowers after Songs says more for the unspectacular
dancing and choreography of the work than it does for her clear,
pleasant singing.
Purposeless Dancing
Perhaps Pasqualetti placed a soprano and a pianist on stage to give
the dancers some kind of target for their bowings and scrapings. But
most of the time, the accompanists were more interesting to watch
than the disjointed triple pas de deux beside them.
Goto's crisp lyricism and some interesting duets by Sally Streets
and Woodd and Deborah Frates and Jeff Sherwood provided a few
memorable moments. But the work itself seemed to represent the
self-indulgence of a choreographer who has figured out every possible
pas de deux combination of three male and three female dancers.
The works presented Friday portray Pasqualetti as a choreographer
who enjoys wrapping his dancers around each other. He fails to move
them around very much, even when the music demands it.
Hopefully, the rest of the Pacific Ballet's repertoire will not bury
the talents of the fine dancers in similar monotony throughout the
remainder of the season.

SAN FRANCISCO—The Pacific Ballet unveiled three modern
ballets by artistic director/choreographer John Pasqualetti at its
season opener Friday night in a three-fourths full Veterans
Auditorium. Despite the commendable efforts of two featured
dancers, ambiguous choreography left the audience wondering what
the instrospective writhing on stage was all about.
Rhapsody In Blue, hailed in the program as a pas de deux tribute
to composer George Gershwin and "American life, love, and funk,"
received an enthusiastic five-minute ovation.
Most of the enthusiasm was generated by the crisp charisma of
Carolyn Goto, who delivered clean-cut, inspired technique throughout
a test-piece that would have tried the endurance of a channel
swimmer. Goto's uncanny flexibility was as evident as her strength in
a succession of supported splits. With a little help from her partner's
shoulder, she hyperextended more than once beyond the 180-degree
mark.
But her interpretation of the Rhapsody left no doubt that Goto
appreciates the potential dramatic impact of even a 45-degree
extension. She moved as a creature of the music itself, blending sharp
fluidity in softer interludes with the hot, vampy moves of a temptress
in the more seductive passages.
Andrew Woodd's strength complemented Goto's crispness

throughout the work. But Pasqualetti's self-conscius choreography
mired him in the introspective type of male role best exemplified by
Erik Bruhn's prince in the lastest version of Swan Lake.
Woodd's psychological contortions seemed pointless. At least Swan
Lake's prince has an elusive Swan Queen to search for.
Rhapsody was sandwiched between two other new works that
should be quickly forgotten or completely restructured.
Nearly Nude Apollo
Friday's night's audience was relatively devoid of the pre-teenage
would-be ballerinas who provide entertainemnt at most dance
performance intermissions by self-importantly parading up and down
the aisles. But even the older crowd reacted with a mixture of gasps
and giggles when the curtains opened to reveal a near-nude Greek god
in Apollo.
After recovering from the shock of John Loschmann's apparant
lack of any costume except a dubious loincloth, the audience
continued to gasp at the dancer's rippling interpretation of Apollo's
birth, set to the music of Stravinsky.
Apollo started off at the heights of Olympus, but quickly rolled
downhill as Pasqualetti's monotonous choreography dragged on
endlessly.
Loss of Innocence
The entrance of three shaky nymphs didn't do much to enliven the
scene. Aided by the stiff, alabaster beauty of nymph Emily Wenk,
Apollo lost his innocence long after the audience had lost its patience.
A shorter version of Apollo would allow the audience to appreciate
Loschmann's breathtaking interpretation and the stunning lighting

effects without being sidetracked by the tiresome cavorting of the
nymphs. In its present form, the audience becomes too tired or bored
to give a fine soloist the enthusiastic recognition he deserves.
Brahms Songs opened the program with a concentration of the
choreographic flaws that plagued all three ballets. Even Goto's vitality
was submerged in the work's utter lack of purpose.
The Pacific Ballet gives a bouquet of roses to the female leads of
each ballet during curtain calls. The fact that soprano Francesca Howe
received the flowers after Songs says more for the unspectacular
dancing and choreography of the work than it does for her clear,
pleasant singing.
Purposeless Dancing
Perhaps Pasqualetti placed a soprano and a pianist on stage to give
the dancers some kind of target for their bowings and scrapings. But
most of the time, the accompanists were more interesting to watch
than the disjointed triple pas de deux beside them.
