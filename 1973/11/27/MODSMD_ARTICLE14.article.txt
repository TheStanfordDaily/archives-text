# James' Big Band Plays Hot As Ever
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
SAN RAFAEL—It was worth
the drive through the rain and
wind to the Marin Memorial
Theatre Saturday, November 17,
to see trumpeter Harry James and
his Orchestra. The show was
fast-paced, entertaining, and drew
an audience of all ages.
Billed "Direct from Las Vegas"
for a one-night engagement, the
Orchestra displayed the
well-rehearsed polish and carefully
thought out presentation that is a
prerequisite of Las Vegas acts.
After a 10 minute delay as a
courtesy to late arrivers, the band
swung into "Tuxedo Junction" as
a cloud of ooh's and aah's arose
from the filled auditorium of
2,900.
Their repertoire contained
modern tunes as well as those that
James made famous. Pianist Jack
Percival provided a fine
arrangement of "Watch What
Happens" which featured a tender
trumpet solo and a clear, almost
brassy tenor sax solo by Eddie
Easton, both merging into a duet.
The arrangements were
characteristic of big bands of the
40s but not so much as to be a
cliche.
Lena Home Touch
Vocalist Sundi Martino added
zing and a touch of Lena Home to
a few Ellington compositions
("I'm Beginning to see the Light"
and "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore") and the orchestra
exhibited versatility and
creditable arrangements of "What
Are You Doing the Rest of Your
Life" and "Proud Mary."
Martino and James then
launched into a medley of songs
for which the Orchestra is well
known, including "Dixie Melody"
and"I Cried for You."
The Harry James Orchestra has
the essentials of a big band
performance — imaginative
arrangements, more than
competent soloists, and a good
drummer. Tenor saxophonist
Eddie Easton was featured

frequently, playing open-toned
melodic solos on ballad numbers
and boppish solos on up-tempo
tunes. During "Help Me Make It
Through the Night," a mellow
muted waa-waa trombone soloed,
and Jack Percival performed an
upbeat solo on "Sheik of Araby."
Drum Solo Wins Ovation
Drummer Les DeMerle added
rhythmic accents in between
choruses and received a standing
ovation after an exhaustive and
nicely-executed solo. "The Lazy
Blues" spotlighted the alto
saxophonist who played a
passionately bluesy solo and for
an encore, James agreed to play
"Two O'clock Jump."

wind to the Marin Memorial
Theatre Saturday, November 17,
to see trumpeter Harry James and
his Orchestra. The show was
fast-paced, entertaining, and drew
an audience of all ages.
Billed "Direct from Las Vegas"
for a one-night engagement, the
Orchestra displayed the
well-rehearsed polish and carefully
thought out presentation that is a
prerequisite of Las Vegas acts.
After a 10 minute delay as a
courtesy to late arrivers, the band
swung into "Tuxedo Junction" as
a cloud of ooh's and aah's arose
from the filled auditorium of
2,900.
Their repertoire contained
modern tunes as well as those that
James made famous. Pianist Jack
Percival provided a fine
arrangement of "Watch What
Happens" which featured a tender
trumpet solo and a clear, almost
brassy tenor sax solo by Eddie
Easton, both merging into a duet.
The arrangements were
characteristic of big bands of the
40s but not so much as to be a
cliche.
Lena Home Touch
Vocalist Sundi Martino added
zing and a touch of Lena Home to
a few Ellington compositions
("I'm Beginning to see the Light"
and "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore") and the orchestra
exhibited versatility and
creditable arrangements of "What
Are You Doing the Rest of Your
Life" and "Proud Mary."
Martino and James then
launched into a medley of songs
for which the Orchestra is well
known, including "Dixie Melody"
and"I Cried for You."
The Harry James Orchestra has
the essentials of a big band
performance — imaginative
arrangements, more than
competent soloists, and a good
drummer. Tenor saxophonist
Eddie Easton was featured

frequently, playing open-toned
melodic solos on ballad numbers
and boppish solos on up-tempo
tunes. During "Help Me Make It
Through the Night," a mellow
muted waa-waa trombone soloed,
and Jack Percival performed an
upbeat solo on "Sheik of Araby."
Drum Solo Wins Ovation
Drummer Les DeMerle added
rhythmic accents in between
choruses and received a standing
ovation after an exhaustive and
nicely-executed solo. "The Lazy
Blues" spotlighted the alto
saxophonist who played a
passionately bluesy solo and for
an encore, James agreed to play
"Two O'clock Jump."
