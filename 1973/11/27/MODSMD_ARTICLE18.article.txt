# Kiley Excellent In Uneven 'Cervantes'
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
No one is better suited to play
the role of the 17th century
novelist, poet and playwright
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra than
the terrific Richard Kiley.
Kiley was the actor who
created the role of Cervantes'
most famous brainchild, Don
Quixote, on Broadway in one of
the greatest musicals of all time,
Man of La Mancha.
In that play, Kiley portrayed
both Quixote and Cervantes, but
the action centered around the
former. In Cervantes, which is not
a musical, the story almost
entirely focuses on the life of the
author.
The new play, an ambitious
effort written by Norman Corwin,
was performed before 1200

spectators at Memorial
Auditorium last Wednesday. The
production is said to be the first
play actually dealing with the life
of Cervantes himself.
Described by Corwin as "a
mosaic for the theater," the play
is precisely that: a series of skits
each of which displays a different
episode in Cervantes' life.
Two Weaknesses
Cervantes — although basically
an enjoyable piece of sometimes
funny, sometimes tragic
entertainment — suffers from two
main weaknesses.
First, there is very little
continuity between the 15 scenes,
which forces the audience to
constantly assimilate new
characters and information.
Furthermore, many scenes simply

seem to be slices of Cervantes' life
with no beginning and no end.
These factors became unpleasant
over a two hour performance.
Second, there is tremendous
variation in the quality of the
scenes. Some of them are quite
funny, while others are
uninteresting. Most of the scenes
can be called amusing, though not
really brilliant.
Bitterness
Corwin, who reportedly
researched Cervantes' life in great
depth, does an excellent job of
subtly portraying through the
dialogue the bitterness that
characterized much of Cervantes'
existence.
All of the skits are set up as
flashbacks, with an old, withered,
wry Cervantes opening and closing

the show. Kiley's portrayal of the
elderly Cervantes is particularly
magnificent.
Several scenes stand out
significantly and deserve special
mention.
In one, John Clarkson, who
plays all of the principal male
supporting roles, does an excellent
job as an old, slightly deaf priest
listening to Cervantes' confession.
The interaction between the two
is very entertaining.
'A Carbuncle'
Another great scene features
Clarkson as a pimp who requests
that Cervantes demonstrate how
he would defend the pimp in
court. Although Cervantes first
describes the pimp as "a carbuncle
on the posterior of Spain," he
then spouts out a ringing

argument proclaiming the virtues
of pimps to society.

Only once does Kiley jump
into the role of Quixote, and that
is after Cervantes is thrown into
prison by the Inquisition.
Cervantes is approached,
apparently from within his own
imagination, by Quixote's faithful
sidekick Sancho Panza, again
portrayed by Clarkson, and
becomes Quixote for a scene.
During the interaction between
Quixote and Sancho, there is a
hilarious segment in which Sancho
attempts to make Quixote believe
that an ugly farm girl is actually
his fantasy princess Dulcinea.
On the negative side, a
soliloquy by the elderly Cervantes
at the beginning of the second act
drones on to the point of
boredom, and a series of taped
voices emanating from the
darkness immediately following
the soliloquy falls flat as a
theatrical technique.
Pace Deteriorates
Even Kiley can't salvage the
beginning of the second act. There
is far too much philosophical
dialogue, and the pace
deteriorates tremendously from
the first act with the stage action
diminishing to almost nothing.
Clarkson is highly competent
in each of his six different roles,
particularly excelling as the priest
and the pimp.
On the other hand, Suzanne
Toren, who portrays the five main
female characters, is generally
unimpressive and relatively
unnoticeable even in scenes in
which she has major roles.
But the only consistently great
performer is Kiley. Give him even
a moderately good line and he
delivers it magnificently.
Kiley's movements and vocal
inflections create the main
substance in an otherwise uneven
and disjointed show. Cervantes, in
his capable hands, is more a
success than not, while with
another lead performer it would
be far less enjoyable.
