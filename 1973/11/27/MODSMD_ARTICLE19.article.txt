# ‘The Beatles: Away With Words'
## Multi-Media Show Can't Stand On Own 
### GEORGE POWELL 
SAN FRANCISCO-A
multi-media show is both a
misused and misleading term.
Most people who promote alleged
"multi-media" shows seem to
think if the presentation uses a
movie projector and a stereo, with
a few slides thrown in for good
measure, it's multi-media.
Such was the case with "The
Beatles: Away With Words,"
extravagantly billed as a show that
would sweep the audience up into
some sort of visual and aural
experience which could only be
equaled by the Beatles appearing
in person.
It would have been nice if
John, Paul, George, and Ringo
had been at the Nourse
Auditorium Friday Night. As a
light show to back a live
performance, the presentation
would have been quite acceptable.
But to sit for over an hour
listening to Beatles records and
watching bits of film, slides and
strobes that flashed directly in the
eyes of the audience wasn't very
nostalgic.
It was more like watching a
light show between acts at the old
Fillmore, and I kept thinking
"Where's the band?"
According to publicity, this
show has been kicking around
America for about three years and
has made the Texans who put it
together over $1.5 million.
They do have a sizeable
amount invested in slide and film
projectors, and some sort of
rudimentary computer to
coordinate the presentation, but
the content just isn't there to
justify the prices being charged

for this "multi-media" experience.
If there had been some new
bits of film, or photos that hadn't
been made public among the
images the audience saw, there
would have been at least a touch
of novelty. But the only time the
audience audibly reacted to
anything on the screen was when

a picture of Hitler was flashed
right after one of President Nixon.
The bits of newsreel film,
World War II footage, and photos
of world leaders were supposed to
lend a historical context to the
Beatles and their place in the
developing musical scene of the
19605. The newsreel footage,
though, was poorly used and

placed out of any logical time
sequence, which added only a
random incoherency to the
presentation.
The Beatles songs were not
presented in any sort of
chronological sense, either, with
"Norwegian Wood," and
"Paperback Writer" preceding
such early compositions as "I
Want To Hold Your Hand."
Toward the end of the show,
someone in the audience got
involved enough to climb up on
stage and do a inebriated
interpretive dance, adding the
missing ingredient, live
performers, to the proceedings.
The dancer got the biggest
round of applause from the
audience for the evening, which
reinforced my conviction that
"The Beatles: Away With Words"
was simply a run-of-the-mill light
show in search of four young men
to perform those recorded songs
live.

has made the Texans who put it
together over $1.5 million.
They do have a sizeable
amount invested in slide and film
projectors, and some sort of
rudimentary computer to
coordinate the presentation, but
the content just isn't there to
justify the prices being charged

for this "multi-media" experience.
If there had been some new
bits of film, or photos that hadn't
been made public among the
images the audience saw, there
would have been at least a touch
of novelty. But the only time the
audience audibly reacted to
anything on the screen was when

a picture of Hitler was flashed
right after one of President Nixon.
The bits of newsreel film,
World War II footage, and photos
of world leaders were supposed to
lend a historical context to the
Beatles and their place in the
developing musical scene of the
19605. The newsreel footage,
though, was poorly used and

placed out of any logical time
sequence, which added only a
random incoherency to the
presentation.
The Beatles songs were not
presented in any sort of
chronological sense, either, with
"Norwegian Wood," and
"Paperback Writer" preceding
such early compositions as "I
Want To Hold Your Hand."
Toward the end of the show,
someone in the audience got
involved enough to climb up on
stage and do a inebriated
interpretive dance, adding the
missing ingredient, live
performers, to the proceedings.
The dancer got the biggest
round of applause from the
audience for the evening, which
reinforced my conviction that
"The Beatles: Away With Words"
was simply a run-of-the-mill light
show in search of four young men
to perform those recorded songs
live.

SAN FRANCISCO-A
multi-media show is both a
misused and misleading term.
Most people who promote alleged
"multi-media" shows seem to
think if the presentation uses a
movie projector and a stereo, with
a few slides thrown in for good
measure, it's multi-media.
Such was the case with "The
Beatles: Away With Words,"
extravagantly billed as a show that
would sweep the audience up into
some sort of visual and aural
experience which could only be
equaled by the Beatles appearing
in person.
It would have been nice if
John, Paul, George, and Ringo
had been at the Nourse
Auditorium Friday Night. As a
light show to back a live
performance, the presentation
would have been quite acceptable.
But to sit for over an hour
listening to Beatles records and
watching bits of film, slides and
strobes that flashed directly in the
eyes of the audience wasn't very
nostalgic.
It was more like watching a
light show between acts at the old
Fillmore, and I kept thinking
"Where's the band?"
According to publicity, this
show has been kicking around
America for about three years and
has made the Texans who put it
together over $1.5 million.
