# Comet Causes Comment
## Many See Kohoutek's Light 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Comet Kohoutek has attracted
religious groups, seers, LSD advocates,
and even scientists to its grand celestial
show. Some students here predict
psychic occurrences, while others see
the comet as the key to eternal peace.
One student, who considers herself
a psychic, said "The comet's position
has much significance. It will appear
exactly perpendicular with its head
pointing to earth and its tail going
upwards, like an exclamation point. I
derive great possibilities for the future
from the comet."
Another student pointed out the
significant coincidence of the comet's
appearance with the birthdate of
Christ. "The comet doesn't signal the
coming of a Messiah, but rather a
reawakening of the Christian
consciousness symbolizing an inner
peace for mankind," he said.
Not all Christians agree. One
religious organization, the Children of
God, based in San Jose, recently
published a pamphlet, 40 Days,
detailing the comet's effect on earth.
A spokesman for the group said,
"Throughout the ages, comets have

brought major events like the deaths
of Karl Marx and Charles Darwin.
Kohoutek, in view for 40 days, relates
to the 40-day destruction of Nineveh
in the Bible. The comet may bring
blood to America, or possibly the
government's collapse."
Student Views
Some students take a more
facetious attitude. One freshman
exclaimed, "I don't know, maybe
Duane Allman will rise from the
dead." A junior commented, "The
comet may bring Prohibition back to
Stanford."
The comet's significance in bringing
"peace and love" has affected many
people including imprisoned LSD
advocate Timothy Leary, who is
watching Kohoutek with keen interest.
Leary's wife Joanna,who is working
with a group of young psychics and
would-be cosmic travelers, is
considering celebrating the comet by
towing a huge pink barge under the
Golden Gate Bridge — perhaps floating
the reunited Beatles on it — and all
kinds of gurus and seers, according to
the National Observer.
Mrs. Leary reportedly predicts that

her husband will be freed from jail,
Nixon will be impeached and all
people united in love.
Others who don't have such
apocalyptic visions, nevertheless
