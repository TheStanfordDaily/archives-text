# Cardinals Rally For Biggest Victory Of 7-4 Season
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
For football purists, it was hardly a masterpiece. But
for Bay Area college fans, Saturday's
Stanford-California battle was one more thrilling episode
for a 76-year series that is, was and always will be The
Big Game.
It didn't matter that there were nine fumbles, or that
Cal punted for a pitiful 29.7 average or that neither team
could mount any sort of offensive attack in the first half
â€” there was enough liquor in the alumni sections and
enough beer and marijuana among the student rooters to
make all 67,000 fans disregard the ineptitude they saw
on the field during the game's first 45 minutes.
Andwhen the fourth quarter finally arrived, the crowd
was ready to return its attention to a football game that
suddenly deserved its long-standing title.
It was worth watching. Scott Laidlaw ran for 70
yards during that period, setting up one touchdown and
scoring another. He burst up the middle for 39 yards on
the second play of Stanford's final scoring drive, and
capped the 81-yard, seven-play march with a 10-yard
sweep for the winning touchdown. Laidlaw ran with his
usual bruising strength and added some unusual speed he
apparently discovered not long before the kickoff.
Double Incentive
"The guys have been ribbing me about not being fast
enough," Laidlaw said, "and when I read a newspaper
article this morning that said Stanford's backs didn't
have any speed, I thought I'd change that around."
Laidlaw's newfound quickness netted 132 yards and
offensive player of the game honors, but he wasn't the
only hero. There was reserve quarterback Dave Ottmar,
who coolly directed the team for most of the second
half after Mike Boryla left the game with a bruised right
shoulder; defensive standouts Forrie Martin, Roger
Still well, Pat Donovan, Terry Pape, Randy Poltl and
James Ferguson; kicker Rod Garcia; and an unheralded
offensive line that continually paved the way for
Laidlaw.
"Every lineman was outstanding," said Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen, not wanting to single out
individuals because "I don't know how to spell their
names. But they all played well."
And besides playing well, they all fought well. The
fading moments of the game featured a 150-man

free-for-all, as both benches emptied following an
exchange of words between Stanford defensive back Jim
Kaffen and Cal tight end Steve Oliver. Helmets were
swung, players were pushed, coaches were pushed and
Stanford's Bill Singler launched an impressive javelin
throw, hurling injured Cal co-captain Kevin O'Dorisio's
crutch at least 30 yards.
Nobody Hurt
Singler was subsequently launched himself, but it was
all good fun, even if Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz cringed a few times during the melee. After all,
Forrie Martin pointed out, "Nobody ever gets hurt.
Nobody did, did they."
After the brawl, both teams returned to the field for
one more play and then the players shook hands. All was
forgotten, except that the Cardinals stormed happily to
the sideline to retrieve the Axe while the Bears trudged
glumly to the visitor's locker room.
Cal coach Mike White was particularly somber. "It's
been a long, trying year for us," he said, "and today we
made the same key mistakes that have plagued us all
year. You just can't beat a good football team like
Stanford and make mistakes like we did."
In all, Cal lost the ball six times, twice on
interceptions and four times on fumbles. They were also
penalized 78 yards, including a painful 15-yard
roughing-the-kicker call that destroyed Cal's momentum
midway in the fourth quarter.
"We don't have the poise of a veteran football team,"
White said. "We just don't have the poised veterans to
make up for those mistakes."
Cardinals Cool
Stanford, though, after matching the Bears mistake
for mistake during the first three quarters, was cool
when it mattered most, despite the fact that
All-American candidate Boryla was sitting on the bench.
Ottmar directed the team flawlessly during the fourth
quarter, as the Cards scored twice and chewed up big
chunks of the scoreboard clock.
"The kids showed a lot of poise," Christiansen
hoarsely but happily said after the game. "Our team has
matured all along.
"Even the young kids like Ron Inge. He fumbled the
kickoff [early in the fourth quarter| and looked pretty
bad, but he came back and ran hard for a touchdown a

few minutes later."
Christiansen's compliments were endless. "1 was
pleased with our offense," he said, "and the defense
played outstanding. Scott Laidlaw did a super job
running. Dave Ottmar did a super job at quarterback."
And Stanford, which finished its sixth straight
winning season with a 7-4 record (7-0 against opponents
not in the nation's top 10), was super all year.
Cardinal Notes: "The Infamous Three," until now
anonymous but hereby identified as Tim Conway, Matt
Conway and Dave Suliteanu, returned the stolen Axe
before the game to Stanford athletic department
officials. Cardinal tri-captains Mike Boryla, Randy Poltl
and Craig Zaltosky then made a formal pre-game
presentation to the Cal tri-captains at midfield, and Cal
had possession of the trophy for the next three hours.
Rod Garcia tied another NCAA record with his two
field goals against the Bears. Garcia ended the 1973
season with 18 three-pointers, tying the record set by
Wyoming's Don Jacobs in 1969. Garcia, who barely
missed a 65-yard attempt Saturday, kicked an NCAA
record 42 field goals during his three-year career.
Stanford now leads the Big Game series, 35-31-10.
The Cards have won 10 times in the last 12 years.
Cal linebacker Ivan Weiss earned defensive player of
the game honors for his 13 tackles, five of which were
unassisted.
The Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band completed another unbeaten season,
soundly defeating Cal's Straw Hat Band, which tried to
be funny but failed.
The four Cal fumbles were recovered by Jim Kaffen,
Joe Martin, Forrie Martin and John Snider. Gordy Riegel
and Randy Poltl intercepted Bear passes.
The following Cardinal seniors have now closed out
their Stanford careers: Bruce Blackstone, Butch
Blanchard, Mike Boryla, James Ferguson, John
Ferguson, Mark Ferguson, Max Goldstein, Pete Hanson,
Reggie Ishman, Doug Jena, Jim Kaffen, Del Lorimer, Joe
Martin, Dave Ottmar, Terry Pape, Randly Poltl, Bill
Reid, Glen Stone, Steve White, John Winesberry and
Craig Zaltoskv.
