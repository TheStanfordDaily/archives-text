## Trojans Top Bruins For Rose Bowl Berth 
### 
The game for which Pepper
Rodgers and his UCLA Bruins had
been aiming for one year ended in
disaster Saturday as USC played
its finest game of the season and
upset the Uclans, 23-13 before
88,000 in Los Angeles and a
national TV audience.
The Bruins, four-point
favorites to gain their first Rose
Bowl bid since Gary Beban and
the miracle workers upset
Michigan State eight years ago,
fell prey to the Trojans' hex for
the fourth consecutive time in a
showdown for the Roses.
This time, along with the
excellent play of the Trojans, the
cause was turnovers: the Bruins
committed six during a
seven-drive stretch of the game.
"Obviously, it was just mistakes
that hurt UCLA," said USC coach
John McKay, back in good graces
with his school's alumni after an
earlier loss to Notre Dame.
McKay, never known for a lack
of vanity, referred to his team's

seemingly-annual Pasadena trip by
saying, "USC is back where it
belongsâ€”in the Rose Bowl,"
where the Trojans will face Ohio
State.
Rodgers, who had tuned his
team's Wishbone attack to the
point where it was scoring over 50
points in most games, said
afterward, "I don't feel worth a
damn."
His Bruins, most agreed, had
possessed their best chance for a
Pasadena bid in many years, and
must now go through a rebuilding
process to obtain a similar
opportunity again.
Oregon State took advantage
of an injury to Oregon tailback
Don Reynolds and two missed
Duck field goals to give Dee
Andros a 17-14 win in the annual
Civil War. The upset win tied the
Beavers with Oregon for sixth in
the Pacific Eight and may have
saved Andros' job for another
year.
Jim Owens wasn't as lucky. His
Washington Huskies were
trounced 52-26 by Washington
State, leaving Owens' club 0-7 in
the conference, with only wins
over weak Idaho and Syracuse for
the season. Owens' 18-vear Huskie
career is in jeopardy.
