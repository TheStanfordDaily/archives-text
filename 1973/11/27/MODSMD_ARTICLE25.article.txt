# Women's Hockey Team Has Fun And Wins
## 
### 
The coach of Stanford's only
undefeated fall sports team adds a
new wrinkle to the traditional
speech of winning coaches.
"The girls played extremely
well .. . and had a good time
doing it," said Shirley Schoof,
coach of the women's field
hockey team, which finished its
regular season 5-0-1 Thursday and
assured itself of at least a tie for
the conference championship.
The season isn't quite over yet
— the eight league schools play a
post-season tournament at Cal
State-Hav ward Friday and
Saturday.
Of the four games the
Cardinals play in this tourney, the
most important will be against
Sacramento State Friday morning.
Earlier this year, the Cards tied
Sacramento — the only blemish
on a record that included wins
over Chico State, San Jose State,
Hayward State and UC-Davis.

Humboldt State and California
are also in the league, but are
weaker and thus played Stanford
only on a JV level.
Schoof looks forward to
another fine (and fun) season next
year. The varsity loses only
co-captain Pia Atkinson (center
half) and Cora Presley (halfback)
through graduation, with Ann
Hiestand (inner) the only loss
from the JV team.
Despite the recent
announcement that women will
become eligible for athletic
scholarships next year, Schoof
says"I don't want to go out and
recruit any players," but she
doesn't "know what implications"
the new policy will have.
But recruiting, scholarships and
the start of competitive bidding
for the services of top players is
still in the future As for this v»ar.
Schoof concludes, "It's keen a
real fun season so far."
