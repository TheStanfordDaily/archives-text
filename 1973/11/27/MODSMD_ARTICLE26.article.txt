# Big Game Ink Bowl
## Daily Leads ‘Daily' Victory 
### 
Veteran quarterback Hall Daily
led the Stanford Daily
Thunderturkeys to an easy 13-0
victory over the Daily Californian
Saturday morning, capping an
outstanding five-year career with
the Farm scribes.
Daily has led his team to four
straight Ink Bowl wins over the
Californians and last year
receieved the Ink Heisman Trophy
after marshalling the squad to its

best record ever, 5-1-1.
So far this season, the
Thunderturkeys are undefeated
and untied in six outings.
Saturday's victory over Cal
clinched the Pacific Eight
Southern Division title for the
Thunderturkeys, who had earlier
beaten the Daily Bruin and the
Daily Trojan.
The Daily will face the KZSU
Krazies and the Las Arcos Eating
Club team before closing out their
season.
Quarterback Daily, who
received Offensive Player of the
Game honors for his performance,
flipped his first touchdown pass
to Dave Robinson. The small, but
sure-handed Robinson had not
seen action since the Daily
drubbed the Daily Bruin six weeks
earlier.
Later in the first half, Daily
hurled his second TD pass of the
morning to flanker Glenn
Kramon, who streaked down the
sideline for the 57-yard score.
Part-time QB Stan Wilson, playing
as a halfback, scored the extra
point on a sweep around left end.
Intense rushing by Defensive
Player of the Game Mark Florant
stympied the Daily Cal's passing
attack all day. Defensive backs
Wilson, Buz Battle and Rich
Cortez, and linebackers Dave
Thiemann and Don Tollefson
prevented long gains on the few
passes which were completed
(Tollefson had not seen action
since the night before.)
After a confident Hall Daily
departed early in the second ha'f.
Wi'.cor. took over the quarterback
spot, but failed to score even
once. "C'est typique." sighed a

lovely young cheerleader on the
sidelines. Nevertheless,
enthusiastic Thunderturkeys
carried the ever-popular Wilson
off the field at the game's
conclusion.
Brimming with enthusiasm,
former Head Coach Ed Kohn
complimented the "infantry" of
the Daily's offensive and defensive
squads: Andrew Bridges, Lynn
Mumby, Bruce Kadden, Jay
Harlow, Christy Wise and Terry
Anzur. "They weren't quite as
bad as last year," Kohn grunted.
The Daily has defeated, in
succession, the San Jose State
Spartan Daily, the UCLA Daily
Bruin, the Administration
Lackeys, the USC Daily Trojan
and the Incomparable LSJUMB.
