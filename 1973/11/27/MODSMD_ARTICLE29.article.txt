# Kaffen, Ferguson Lead Celebration
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's cornerbacks, Jim
Kaffen and James Ferguson, who
helped the Cards beat Cal 26-17
Saturday, led the celebration after
the last game of their college
careers in their individual ways.
Kaffen, the little (5-10, 180
pound) guy who seems to live on
the thin line between aggressive
defense and pass interference, was
one of the instigators of the
second annual Big Game Fight,
which took place in the closing
seconds of the game.
According to Kaffen, it was a
compliment he paid to Cal tight
end Steve Oliver that caused the
brawl. "I patted him on the head
and said 'Nice game. Too bad you
lost.' I kept running, he pushed
me and all hell broke loose."
Kaffen later admitted his
remark to Oliver was "kind of
facetious." However the shoving
match began, it soon became a
donnybrook that excited those
among the 67,000 fans who were
still seeing straight. (Many used
alcohol as an energy-conserving
way of keeping warm)
Irish Spirit
Highlight of the brawl occured
when Kevin O'Doricio, injured Cal
center chosen one of the
co-captains of the game, hobbled
onto the field, tossed one crutch
away and started swinging the
other around with Irish gusto that
would make a Chicago cop cry.
Bill Singler, one of the smallest
players on the field, picked up the
discarded crutch and tossed it
downf-eld. Subsequently, a bigger
Cal player tossed Singler in much
the same manner.
After a couple minutes, the
refs broke up the fight, which
apparently left no hard feelings
and seems destined to become as
much a part of the Big Game as
the Axe.
Forgotten Trophy
Anyway, Stanford ran off one
meaningless play, counted down
the seconds and ran out onto the
field joyously. A few players,
obviously somewhat larger than
Kaffen or Singler, carried coach
Jack Christiansen out to the
center of the field to meet Cal
coach Mike White. And then the
team ran off to the locker room.
Forgetting something? Oh yes,
the Axe, which Stanford

tri-captains Mike Boryla, Randy
Poltl and Craig Zaltosky had
returned to Cal's captains prior to
the game.
That's where the quick
thinking of Ferguson saved the
day. He led a charge of about 10
Stanford players to the Cal side of
the field and regained the Axe for
the Farm.
Reasons For Playing
"What did they |some of the
teammates] think we were
playing for?," an astonished
Ferguson asked. "They were going
to play all day and leave the
Axe."
Kaffen had another reason for
playing. "There was a lot of
sentiment on our team that the
reason Mike White and those guys
left Stanford [White and three
other assistant coaches went to
Cal after the 1972 Rose Bowl |
was because they didn't think we
had any quality players left. I
think we proved we did," Kaffen
said.
Kaffen, Ferguson and safeties
Poltl and Zaltosky, who together
comprised the league's best pass
defense, are all graduating, leaving
the biggest hole Christiansen and
his staff must plug during the
off-season.
Thinking Ahead
The other defensive stars —
ferocious ends Roger Stillwell and
Pat Donovan, colorful inside
linebackers Forrie Martin and
Gordy Riegel — all return next
year, and the word "Rose Bowl"
eminated from all eight of their
lips after Saturday's win.
In fact, the Cards' exuberant
coaching staff has posted the sign
"Beat Penn State" on the locker
room wall, already thinking about
next year's season opener.
But for the graduating
members of Stanford's most
effective unit, its defensive
backfield, smaller goals, like a Big
(lame win over Cal, are enough to
savor.

helped the Cards beat Cal 26-17
Saturday, led the celebration after
the last game of their college
careers in their individual ways.
Kaffen, the little (5-10, 180
pound) guy who seems to live on
the thin line between aggressive
defense and pass interference, was
one of the instigators of the
second annual Big Game Fight,
which took place in the closing
seconds of the game.
According to Kaffen, it was a
compliment he paid to Cal tight
end Steve Oliver that caused the
brawl. "I patted him on the head
and said 'Nice game. Too bad you
lost.' I kept running, he pushed
me and all hell broke loose."
Kaffen later admitted his
remark to Oliver was "kind of
facetious." However the shoving
match began, it soon became a
donnybrook that excited those
among the 67,000 fans who were
still seeing straight. (Many used
alcohol as an energy-conserving
way of keeping warm)
Irish Spirit
Highlight of the brawl occured
when Kevin O'Doricio, injured Cal
center chosen one of the
co-captains of the game, hobbled
onto the field, tossed one crutch
away and started swinging the
other around with Irish gusto that
would make a Chicago cop cry.
Bill Singler, one of the smallest
players on the field, picked up the
discarded crutch and tossed it
downf-eld. Subsequently, a bigger
Cal player tossed Singler in much
the same manner.
After a couple minutes, the
refs broke up the fight, which
apparently left no hard feelings
and seems destined to become as
much a part of the Big Game as
the Axe.
Forgotten Trophy
Anyway, Stanford ran off one
meaningless play, counted down
the seconds and ran out onto the
field joyously. A few players,
obviously somewhat larger than
Kaffen or Singler, carried coach
Jack Christiansen out to the
center of the field to meet Cal
coach Mike White. And then the
team ran off to the locker room.
Forgetting something? Oh yes,
the Axe, which Stanford

tri-captains Mike Boryla, Randy
Poltl and Craig Zaltosky had
returned to Cal's captains prior to
the game.
That's where the quick
thinking of Ferguson saved the
day. He led a charge of about 10
Stanford players to the Cal side of
the field and regained the Axe for
the Farm.
Reasons For Playing
"What did they |some of the
teammates] think we were
playing for?," an astonished
Ferguson asked. "They were going
to play all day and leave the
Axe."
Kaffen had another reason for
playing. "There was a lot of
sentiment on our team that the
reason Mike White and those guys
left Stanford [White and three
other assistant coaches went to
Cal after the 1972 Rose Bowl |
was because they didn't think we
had any quality players left. I
think we proved we did," Kaffen
said.
Kaffen, Ferguson and safeties
Poltl and Zaltosky, who together
comprised the league's best pass
defense, are all graduating, leaving
the biggest hole Christiansen and
his staff must plug during the
off-season.
Thinking Ahead
The other defensive stars —
ferocious ends Roger Stillwell and
Pat Donovan, colorful inside
linebackers Forrie Martin and
Gordy Riegel — all return next
year, and the word "Rose Bowl"
eminated from all eight of their
lips after Saturday's win.
In fact, the Cards' exuberant
coaching staff has posted the sign
"Beat Penn State" on the locker
room wall, already thinking about
next year's season opener.
But for the graduating
members of Stanford's most
effective unit, its defensive
backfield, smaller goals, like a Big
(lame win over Cal, are enough to
savor.
