VALLETTA, Malta (AP) -
Palestinian guerrillas released more
than 250 passengers and crew
members of a hijacked Dutch jumbo
jet today, and the plane took off for a
secret destination.
Aboard the Boeing 747 jet as it
headed east were the three hijackers, a
vice president of KLM, the Dutch
airline, who went along as a hostage,
and nine or 10 crewmen.
The hijackers talked with Egyptian
Charge d'Affairs Samir Mohammed
Kamel, representative of Egyptian
Ambassador Mustafa Kama! Mortagui
who lives in Rome. Official sources
said the hijackers wanted Kamel to fly
with them as a hostage, but he did not
board the plane.
Sharpshooters surrounded the
plane. The guerrillas negotiated from
inside the plane with Egyptian
authorities for five hours before
Premier Dom Mintoff of Malta took
over.
Mintoff conducted the negotiations
from the airport control tower with
one of the guerrillas who spoke
English, the airport sources said.
The plane was hijacked over Iraq
Sunday after it took off from Beirut
on a scheduled flight from Amsterdam
to Tokyo. It was forced to fly to
Damascus, Syria; to Nicosia, Cyprus;
and then to Tripoli, Libya before

landing at Malta's Luqa Airport.
The hijackers were believed to be
members of a little-known guerrilla
group, the Arab Youth Organization
for the Liberation of Palestine.
The hijackers were thought to have
chosen the KLM plane because of
Arab charges that the Dutch airline
transported volunteers to Israel during
last month's war.
The airline denied the charges. In
addition, the Dutch government in an
official statement said KLM would not
transport war material to Israel, that
Dutchmen serving in the Israeli forces
faced the loss of their citizenship and
that the Netherlands is not a transit
country for Jewish immigrants from
the Soviet Union.
When told that the jumbo could
not take off from the short runway
with all the passengers and a full load
of fuel, the hijackers apparently agreed
to free the passengers and the plane's
eight stewardesses in return for fuel
and the two hostages.
The initial group freed consisted of
120 passengers, all Japanese. The first
ones to be driven out of the airport to
a hotel looked tired but in high spirits.
