Forced Heat Reduction Due
WASHINGTON — Homeowners who heat with oil
would be forced — not asked — to reduce their home
temperatures by six degrees this winter, under federal
regulations to be proposed today.
A draft of the regulations, obtained by The Associated
Press and verified by administration sources, shows that
others who heat with oil, including commercial and
government buildings, would be forced to lower
temperatures ten degrees or make equivalent fuel savings.
Barring unforeseen complications, the regulation is
planned to take effect next Jan. 1, but it gives
homeowners a grace period before its full impact hits.
Homeowners would be allowed to fill their fuel tanks
at the outset. If their efforts to reduce heating fall short
the first time around, the dealers may refill their tanks
and give them a warning to cut down more strictly.
With the third fuel-oil delivery, however, comes the
moment of truth. Then, dealers would be required to
deliver enough oil to maintain the legally permitted
temperature and no more.
The Dallas News said yesterday that major
oil firms have been ordered by the U.S. government to
deliver fuel immediately to the Defense Department to
replace supplies cut off by the Arab oil embargo.
The News said in a copyright story that the fuel is
being taken from the civilian sector to maintain defense
readiness. It quoted Defense Department sources.
Tapes 'Accidentally' Erased
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's personal secretary
testified yesterday she accidentally pushed a recording

button while listening to a White House tape. A
prosecutor said the erased portion covered all discussion
of the Watergate scandal during a presidential
conversation.
The disclosures were made in federal court after
Nixon's lawyers turned over seven subpoenaed White
House tape recordings and asked that all or portions of
three of them be withheld from the Watergate grand jury.
Rose Mary Woods, Nixon's secretary of 23 years, was
questioned at a hearing called to determine what had
happened to the tape of a conversation between the
President and H.R. Haldeman on June 20, 1972. The
White House says there is an 18-minute gap in the
recording.
Miss Woods told the court she believes she
inadvertently pushed the recording button when she
turned to answer her telephone while working on the June
20 tape last Oct. 1.
She testified that she immediately told Nixon about
pushing the button and he replied, "No problem, that is
not a subpoenaed tape."
Nixon To Bare Tax Returns
WASHINGTON — President Nixon promised yesterday
to make public later this week copies of his "relevant"
income tax returns and said they would vindicate him of
any accusations of financial wrongdoing, one of six
senators meeting with him said.
Sen. Bennett J. Johnston Jr., D-La., said the President
indicated he would disclose complete returns and not
summaries of them.
The publication of Nixon's personal tax return would
be the first in the history of the presidency.
Johnston said the President was not asked how or
where the returns would be released or what years they
would cover.
"He mentioned to all of us that he decidedly did not
urge others in public life to follow his example," Johnston
said.
