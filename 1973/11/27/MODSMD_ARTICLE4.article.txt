# Ecologists Combat Backlash Caused By Energy Shortage

### K.C. FLYNN News Analysis 
Bay Area ecological groups are worried about many of
their efforts in the wake of the nation's worsening energy
crisis.
"It would be unfortunate, perhaps even tragic, if a lot
of environmental laws and regulations are lost under a
blanket label of the energy crisis," John Abbott, editor of
Cry California said recently.
War in the Mideast and the resulting embargo of Arab
oil have brought the prospect of chilly homes and
rationing of fuel for automobiles. Environmental groups
are getting some of the blame. "If we had not had the
environmentalists fighting the Alaskan pipeline, there
would be no shortage now," California's Gov. Ronald
Reagan said recently.
The pipeline bill has passed Congress and was signed by
the President last week. It had been delayed three years
by environmental battles. The earliest the
million-barrel-a-day pipeline could go into operation
would be sometime in 1977.
Environmentalists' Fear
"Our greatest fear," said Gene Cowen of the Sierra
Club in San Francisco, "is that in the course of an
immediate shortage, there will be a rush of long-term
commitments."
Congress recently approved legislation that enables the
President to relax environmental standards on a
case-bv-case basis, as part of an overall plan to conserve
energy. The Sierra Club agrees with the case-by-case

response to the problem, said Cowen, but disagrees with
the long term situation outlined by the President in his
recent energy statement.
"It's really a misunderstanding of the situation to say
that what we need is more energy," said Cowen. "What
the President should be saying is that we must learn to live
with less energy from here on out, now and forever," he
added.
Sensitive Areas
Abbott of Cry California said that in this state the
search for new sources of energy would touch many
sensitive areas. "There is talk of many more atomic plants,
of opening the Santa Barbara Channel for oil drilling and
the opening of the Elk Hills Naval Reserve for oil.
"These efforts are a futile attempt to catch up in the
long run," Abbott said. "The emphasis should be on how
to cut demands."
Legislation before Congress calls for a change in the
Clean Air Act of 1970 to allow burning of "dirtier" fuels,
including a switch from oil to coal in power plants if
possible.
Poor Solution
In Palo Alto, Janet Adams of the California Coastal
Alliance said, "We believe softening environmental laws
will not solve the nation's energy problems."
Rose Beatty of the Peninsula Conservation Center said
that relaxation of environmental laws "will not lessen our
work by any means. It will make us more alert to the
kinds of things done by industry. All the controls will be
