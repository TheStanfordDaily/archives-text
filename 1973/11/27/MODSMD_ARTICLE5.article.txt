# Women's Panel Seeks Change
## Health Care Evaluated 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Student Health Services, met
last night with several members of the
Task Force on Women's Medical Care
to discuss possible changes in services
for women at the health center.
Task force member Lyse Strnad
gave McClenahan a list including
suggestions for peer counseling led by
couples on contraception and
sexuality, improved sex education
resources, improved abortion referral
and improved gynecological service.
Eligibility of non-students for
contraceptive care if they are sexually
involved with Stanford students was
also discussed.
McClenahan stated that peer

counseling on sex and contraception is
"feasible if there is a group of people
interested in doing it." McClenahan
and the students present agreed that
while counseling might be effective in
classes, it is also important that
counseling be available on an
individual basis.
Counseling would be "on the same
order of magnitude as The Bridge [the
campus counseling and drop-in
center]," according to McClenahan.
Potential counselors would be
screened carefully and might be
trained in a course similar to the
SWOPSI course which trains
counselors for The Bridge.
McClenahan agreed with the task force
that counseling done by couples for
couples is desirable.
Questioned by task force members
on gynecological care at the health
center, McClenahan explained that a
male gynecologist is being hired as a
replacement for former staff member
Dr. Sue Ellen Massey.
In addition, a nurse-practitioner is
being trained for placement as a
full-time staff member, and a female
physician formerly with Planned
Parenthood has joined the staff,
although not as a gynecologist.
In reply to inquiries about the
possible hiring of a female
gynecologist, McClenahan stated that
if an opening in the staff occurs, it is
possible that a woman gynecologist
will be hired. However, McClenahan
questioned the assumption that only
gynecologists can handle gynecological
problems, saying, "Most of the women
in this country receive gynecological
care from a physician other than a
gynecologist."
At present, contraceptive
counseling and other gynecological
services are performed largely by the
regular Cowell staff. Although
students complain that waits of three
weeks for counseling occur,
McClenahan stated that even without a

staff gynecologist, the wait at present
is only one week.
In regard to sex education, Strnad
said students need more information,
"without having to take Dr. [Herant]
Katchadourian's human sexuality
class." McClenahan suggested that the
section on sexuality and contraception
in the health center's booklet "People
Should Feel Good" might be
expanded. In addition, McClenahan
favored dorm discussions and the
student proposal of a possible
symposium.
ASSU vice-president Beth Garfield,
a member of the task force, stated that
students interested in becoming
counselors or working on the health
center booklet for next fall should
contact the Women's Center or the
ASSU office.

"without having to take Dr. [Herant]
Katchadourian's human sexuality
class." McClenahan suggested that the
section on sexuality and contraception
in the health center's booklet "People
Should Feel Good" might be
expanded. In addition, McClenahan
favored dorm discussions and the
student proposal of a possible
symposium.
ASSU vice-president Beth Garfield,
a member of the task force, stated that
students interested in becoming
counselors or working on the health
center booklet for next fall should
contact the Women's Center or the
ASSU office.
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Student Health Services, met
last night with several members of the
Task Force on Women's Medical Care
to discuss possible changes in services
for women at the health center.
Task force member Lyse Strnad
gave McClenahan a list including
suggestions for peer counseling led by
couples on contraception and
sexuality, improved sex education
resources, improved abortion referral
and improved gynecological service.
Eligibility of non-students for
contraceptive care if they are sexually
involved with Stanford students was
also discussed.
McClenahan stated that peer

counseling on sex and contraception is
"feasible if there is a group of people
interested in doing it." McClenahan
and the students present agreed that
while counseling might be effective in
classes, it is also important that
counseling be available on an
individual basis.
Counseling would be "on the same
order of magnitude as The Bridge [the
campus counseling and drop-in
center]," according to McClenahan.
Potential counselors would be
screened carefully and might be
trained in a course similar to the
SWOPSI course which trains
counselors for The Bridge.
McClenahan agreed with the task force
that counseling done by couples for
couples is desirable.
Questioned by task force members
on gynecological care at the health
center, McClenahan explained that a
male gynecologist is being hired as a
replacement for former staff member
Dr. Sue Ellen Massey.
In addition, a nurse-practitioner is
being trained for placement as a
full-time staff member, and a female
physician formerly with Planned
Parenthood has joined the staff,
although not as a gynecologist.
In reply to inquiries about the
possible hiring of a female
gynecologist, McClenahan stated that
if an opening in the staff occurs, it is
possible that a woman gynecologist
will be hired. However, McClenahan
questioned the assumption that only
gynecologists can handle gynecological
problems, saying, "Most of the women
in this country receive gynecological
care from a physician other than a
gynecologist."
At present, contraceptive
counseling and other gynecological
services are performed largely by the
regular Cowell staff. Although
students complain that waits of three
weeks for counseling occur,
McClenahan stated that even without a

staff gynecologist, the wait at present
is only one week.
In regard to sex education, Strnad
said students need more information,
"without having to take Dr. [Herant]
Katchadourian's human sexuality
class." McClenahan suggested that the
section on sexuality and contraception
in the health center's booklet "People
Should Feel Good" might be
expanded. In addition, McClenahan
