# New York Charter Rescheduled
## 
### 
The continuation of a strike of
Trans World Airlines (TWA) cabin
attendants has forced the ASSU Travel
Service to cancel a 163-seat charter
flight to New York on Dec. 14.
ASSU Travel Service Manager Terry
Hess said yesterday that he has
arranged for a 252-seat World Airlines
charter to accommodate those
students, faculty, and staff signed up
for the flight, at the same $159 round
trip fare.
However, he noted the Travel
Service is taking a "large financial
risk" because it must sell the extra 89
seats, which cost an additional
$14,000, within the next two and a
half weeks. Hess said he expects the 40
people on the New York charter
waiting list to purchase seats, but
added that at least 43 more tickets
must be sold for the Travel Service to
break even.
Should the flight lose money, Hess
said that profits from other ASSU
flights, which usually go back into
general ASSU funds, will help
compensate. He added that he will
discuss possible emergency ASSU
funding with ASSU Financial Manager
Dave Martin.
Hess said he felt an "obligation to
find an alternate flight" after
concluding that the TWA flight
attendants, who have been off the job
since early) fctober, would probably
not resume work until after the busy
Christmas holiday.
"Because of the energy crisis [and
resulting cancelations of many flights!
it is doubtful that many people would
find alternate flights even at the
regular $336 round trip price," Hess
said.
The World Airways charter will
depart for Kennedy Airport from
Oakland instead of San Francisco Dec.
14, and will return on Jan. 6. Hess said
that the Travel Service will provide bus
service to Oakland International
Airport as well as to San Francisco
International.
Ticket-holders for the TWA flight
may cancel their reservations, Hess
said. Otherwise, the Travel Service will
automatically 'transfer their names to
the World Airways list.
Hess noted that the two other
scheduled charter flights to New York
on United Airlines will remain as
originally announced.
