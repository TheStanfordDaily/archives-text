# Intimidation Abets Indifference
## Foster: Throwback To The Sixties? 
### 
Chris Murray

There's a dangerous trend of
regression taking place in this
country today and it relates
directly to the passive, indifferent,
silent attitude on the part of the
vast majority of Americans in the
United States. This has been
dramatically borne out in recent
happenings from Watergate, to the
loosening of this University's
commitment to people of color,
to the incident of and aftermath
of the assassination of Oakland's
School Superintendent, Dr.
Marcus A. Foster.
There's little doubt to my
mind that this country has taken
on a pre-'6os coloration, i.e., the
predominate attitude today seems
to be that if you're a minority, or
if you're poor, or if you're ill
treated or discriminated against —
it's just too bad.
I would like to say that I agree.
It really is too bad. Too bad for
America. For if the sixties have to
be re-enacted all over again,
believe me, this present regressive
trend will not prevail!
I grew to admire the dynamic,
conscience-committed men of the
sixties — men like John Fitzgerald
Kennedy, Martin Luther King,
Robert Francis Kennedy, and
Malcolm X to name a few —
because these men refused to
acquiesce to intimidation. To
paraphrase another's words, "they
saw wrong and tried to right it;
they saw a need and tried to fulfill
it" at the cosl of their stamina
and, in the end, their lives.
Resisted Intimidation
Dr. Marcus Foster was a man
of the same ideals. He saw his job
and he refused to agree with a
man he thought to be wrong, or
to desist in his job at the point of
a gun. He refused to be
intimidated and in the end it cost
him, too, his life.
It's a pity that these kinds of
men are few and far in between.
We seem only to get an abundance
of the Agnew sorts — where the
dollar determines the amount of
conviction and morality auctioned
to the highest bidder.
We have silence today — not
many sit-ins, very few riots, very
little national discord — and the
foolish would be led to believe

that all is well in America.
But don't be fooled, this
superficial serenity is only
indicative of the fact that the
carefully orchestrated suppression
efforts from 1970 to 1973 have
been successful.
The poor are still hungry, still
homeless, more powerless, and
still cursing under their breaths
and all the time getting poorer.
Harassment Continues
The people of color in this
University, like those across this
country, are still being subjected
to racial harassment. Ulteriorly
motivated scientific minds have
undertaken to objectively research
and pronounced their fellow man,
by race, innately and genetically
unfit — using hard earned degrees
and reputations as letters of
credence for their findings —
when in truth they know little of
what they say and care very little
for those of whom they speak.
By suppressive efforts these
minority groups have been
severely weakened in their ability
to resist the injustices that once
again are being heaved upon them.
Their gallant warriors for justice,
their eloquent spokesmen, stir the
air, and the consciousness, no
more.
In the case of Dr. Foster, the
law has been slow to move and
scanty coverage of the affair was
given by the news. Could this be
because it was not merely a public
official that was assassinated, but
a BLACK public official?
And as deplorable as the act
was, no justice conscious
"majority" rose in dissent either.
What was witnessed was a
disquieting silence.
This reminds me only too well
of how not too long ago fifty
Black men could be swung or
lynched on a single tree, and no
one would say a word. The
intimidated Blacks were silent out
of fear and the non-black majority
remained dormant as well.
A History of Silence
It was this same sort of silence
that allowed 6 million humans to
die in Germany, that allowed
countless number of atrocities to
be committed to Blacks in the
U.S. "South" as well as in South
Africa, that allowed us to get into

an undeclared v.ar in Southeast
Asia, and that almost allowed a
handful of men in Washington
D.C. to drastically alter, if not
rewrite, the very document upon
which this country was founded.
Albert Einstein once said, "the
world is in greater peril from
those who tolerate evil, than from
those who actively commit it."
On the same thought, John F.
Kennedy once wrote, "those who
do nothing are inviting shame as
well as violence." Martin Luther
King reminded us all that "bigotry
and hatred are not urgent. The
urgency comes with the silence —
the onlookers — who actually
imperil the ideals, image, and
aspirations of America itself.
Have we so easily forgotten the
lessons of the '60s?
The silence, the indifference,
the waning commitment to the
rights of minorities in this
country, and the indifferent
unconcern that witnessed the
death and assailment of one of
our leading Black educators, Dr.
Marcus A. Foster, is a dangerous
sign of the beginning decadence in
the area of social reform and
personal liberties, albeit,
symptoms of the missing men
who were beginning to make this
country truly great — those men
of peace.

My hope is still that these men
and Dr. Foster have not died in
vain, and that tyranny and
intimidation will not be allowed
to further precipitate decadence
in our American society.
Personally, I still have a dream — a
dream that Martin Luther King's
four little children may yet live in
a nation where they will not be
judged by the color of their skin,
but rather by the content of their
character.

Associated Staff of Students for
Action, delivered this speech at a
memorial on campus to Dr.
Marcus Foster.)
