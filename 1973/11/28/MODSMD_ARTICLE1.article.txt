# Axe Rests Comfortably In Secure Hiding Place
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford's Axe, long a symbol of Big Game supremacy,
is resting comfortably — somewhere — after a wild week
of deception, trickery, hard-nosed bargaining and flying
tackles both on and off the football field.
"It's in a secure place," Axe Commission Chairman
Robert Matteri said. "The police department knows where
it is."
The Axe returned to Stanford — following a three hour
absence — Saturday afternoon after the Cardinal football
team whipped California 26-17. But it made an earlier
appearance on campus last Tuesday after the Infamous
Three of Theta Delta Chi stole it from the Cal Rally
Committee.
The Berkeley school had possession of the Axe after
winning the 1972 Big Game, but the Infamous Three
tricked Cal into bringing it out of hiding by imitating Bear
football coach Mike White over the telephone. Then they
stole it in a classic strong-arm heist.
"We didn't really know what he sounded like, but we
figured no one else did either," explained junior Dave
Suliteanu, an economics major who composes one third of
the Infamous Three.
Conway Brothers
Economics senior Tim Conway and his brother Matt, a
San Francisco law student, were the other two figures in
the Axe-napping.
Not only did the Infamous Three steal the Axe, but
they refused to give it back for a time. They asked instead

that a new tradition — letting the two schools steal it from
one another each fall — be inaugurated. Only after two
meetings with University administrators did they agree to
give it up, and the football team captains presented it to
Cal just before the kickoff Saturday.
Negotiations began when Stanford administrators
recognized a Theta Delt who helped carry the Axe off
from the parking lot of Ming's, where the theft actually
occurred, and sent a University security officer over to the
fraternity to set up a meeting.
10 Demands
"We walked into the meeting stone serious and gave
them a list of 10 demands," Suliteanu recounted. "We
said, 'We won't even negotiate until you meet these.' "
The demands included $6000 cash, Thanksgiving dinner
with President Lyman, admission to any Stanford
graduate school and the services of Law Prof. John Kaplan
as defense counsel.
"They sort of smiled, and from then on everything was
all right," Conway said.
Suliteanu and Conway said they gave up their idea of
theft and counter-theft when they realized that further
reluctance would damage their central goal — "making the
Axe more important as a symbol of the Stanford-Cal
rivalry," according to Suliteanu.
Big Complaint
At least one of their biggest complaints — that the Axe
is hardly ever seen by Stanford students — is apparently
almost resolved. Spokesmen in the office of the Dean of
Student Affairs said yesterday that alumni interest, stirred
up by the Axe theft, will probably result in financial
contributions for a new trophy case or room.
Meanwhile, the Axe Commission is negotiating with
Wells Fargo to temporarily display the trophy in a case in
the bank's Tresidder office.
"The only hangup is security," Matteri said, indicating
that the bank management would be reluctant to fight off
a gang of would-be Axe thieves if they should appear.
And the Infamous Three are trying to decide what to
do as a followup. "We thought we might steal the Axe
back from Stanford and give it to Cal," Suliteanu said last
night. "That would be really classv."

GAVE 'EM THE AXE — Tim Conway (1.) and Dave Suliteanu, two-thirds of the "Infamous Three," relax after a hectic
week of deception, thievery and good-humored negotiations with University officials. Conway, Suliteanu and Conway's
brother Matt stole the Stanford Axe from the witless Cal Rally Committee last Tuesday.
