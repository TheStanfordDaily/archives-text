Prison Studies
hxutor:
"Corrections," the massive and
un-coordinated network of
American prisons, jails and
juvenile training schools is the
part of the criminal justice system
most invisible to the American
middle-class public. Traditionally
we have ignored prisons, not only,
as the President's Commission on
Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice reports,
because many of the juveniles and
adults with whom corrections
deals are "the most troubling and
troublesome members of society,"
but also because prisons embody
many of the contradictions,
disquieting to admit and difficult
to confront, that operate in a
racist and economically
exploitative capitalist society.
Two years ago (Jan. 18, 1971)
Time magazine reported the
experience of 23 judges from all
over the U.S. who spent a single
night at the Nevada State Prison.
They emerged "appalled at the
homo-sexuality," shaken by the
inmates "soul-shattering
bitterness" and upset by "men
raving, screaming and pounding
on the walls." Kansas Judge E.
Newton Vickers declared, "I felt
like an animal in a cage. Ten years
in there must be like 100 or
maybe 200," and he urged Nevada
to "send two bulldozers out there
and tear the damn thing to the
ground."
It is by now axiomatic that
prisons breed crime. The challenge
to us is to come to terms with
these institutions, responsible
yearly for more than two and a
half million people, and to
confront the complex problems
they suggest. For example, can
genuine prison reform be
accomplished merely by spending
more money on more programs?
Are "behavior therapy" methods
of drugs and psychosurgery
appropriate for use in prisons to
prevent or reduce violence? What
particular forms of control are
exercised by penal authorities
upon women inmates? In what
ways are American prisoners
"political prisoners"? Can prisons
be abolished?
The Prison Information Center,
located at the Old Firehouse, is
initiating a study group that will
examine and discuss these and
other questions of interest to the
group, with an emphasis upon what
we as individuals or as members of
a group can do to implement our
ideas. Our first meeting will be at
3:30 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 29
in the Grove House lounge.

Tax Exempt Status
Editor:
I have just read the Nov. 14
Daily and am deeply concerned
about the decision to restrict
church activities to those that the
University president included in
the "guidelines" written by him in
1970.
I am a senior engineer and I
have been a member of the
American Civil Liberties Union
for 20 years. As a result of this
membership I become quite
disturbed when I hear two
non-laywers — in this case Kelly
and Lyman — giving legal opinions
to newspaper reporters. This is a
legal matter. In fact, it is a basic
constitutional question: "Can the
tax exempt status of a recognized
religious institution be revoked if
the institution engages in any legal
activity."
The answer to this important
question is not one for laymen to
speculate about as Kelly and
Lyman were quoted as doing. I
strongly recommend that a lawyer
be contacted who specializes in
these issues. I suggest asking a law
school or the ACLU for the name
of one. If you I Kelly] allow the
threat from a layman regarding
tax status to influence the
activities of your church without
consulting a legal specialist you
have acted hastily.
This is an important issue not
only for the students but for all
people. Can the power to grant
favored tax status for religious
organizations be used to restrict
their otherwise legal activities?
This question cannot be answered
by layman. Please contact a legal
specialist before placing
restrictions on student activities
which may be constitutionally
guaranteed.
