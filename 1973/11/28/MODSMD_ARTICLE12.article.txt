# Hot Tuna Heads Maples Concert
## 
### 
Hot Tuna (above), the Albert King Review, and
Bloomfield/Naftalin will appear in concert this
Saturday, Dec. 1, at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
The concert is sponsored by ASSU Special Events.
Michael Bloomfield, guitar, and Mark Naftalin,
keyboards, are veterans of the Paul Butterfield Blues
Band, the first and finest of the white blues groups
which appeared on the scene in the mid-60s. Both
have since appeared on numerous albums in backup
or lead capacities, and have recently signed a
contract to record together again. The two are
backed by bassist John Kahn, also a veteran session
man.
Albert King has been' King of the Blues'for years,
and has served as a model for dozens of young blues
guitarists in America and England. The left-handed
guitarist, who taught himself to play a guitar upside
down, still plays it that way, and as well as anybody
around.

Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen are another
team with a history that dates to the early 60s. As
the instrumental nucleus of the Jefferson Airplane,
they were always in the forefront of the San
Francisco sound. Four years ago they diversified in
the form of Hot Tuna. Since then, their music has
gone full circle. Beginning with an all-acoustic
album cut live in a Berkeley club, their sound
shifted to hard electric rock, which culminated in
the years with violinist Papa John Creach. Papa John
has since left to form his own band, and Hot Tuna
has gone back to the mellower country-city blues
style of their first two albums.
Tickets are $4 and $5 for general admission, with
a limited number of reserved loge seats available at
$5.50 at Tresidder only. General admission tickets
are available at Tresidder, Macy's, Banana Records
and Town & Country Music in Palo Alto, and most
major box offices.
