# 'Choreographic Crazy Man'
## Taylor Dance Company Grows Stiff 
### JANICE ROSS 
SAN JOSE — Last Saturday
night at San Jose State, an artistic
truth was demonstrated. The
occasion was a performance by
the Paul Taylor Dance Company,
and the truth was that even a
talented choreographer can flop.
Taylor is not new to the dance
scene. He began choreographing
and performing twenty years ago
in New York, and since then he
has had a varied and lively career,
both as a soloist in the companies
of Merce Cunningham and Martha
Graham, and as head of his own
New York-based company.
Very early in his career, Taylor
distinguished himself as a
choreographic crazy man. He was
the first choreographer to
introduce a dog on stage as part of
a dance performance, and he
further shocked New York
audiences by presenting Untitled
Duet, a dance where two dancers
remained motionless for the
fifteen minute interval between
the raising and lowering of the
stage curtain.
In these works, Taylor's
purpose was not to shock or
offend; rather, he was concerned
with exploring the choreographic
limits of dance. Throughout the
1950s and early '60s Taylor
continued to present works that
forced audiences to reexamine
what dance and movement were
all about.
Excitement, Outrage Missing
It was an understandable
disappointment Saturday night
when Taylor's newest
choreographic effort, American
Genesis, failed to generate any of
the excitement or outrage of his
earlier works. The piece is a
collection of five dances centered,
quizically enough, around biblical
themes, the dancers alternately
assuming roles such as Cain, Abel,
Adam, Eve, Noah, etc.
The costuming was garish, with

Taylor and others frequently
appearing in Quaker-style coats
and hats, and the movement was
correspondingly tortuous,
uninspired, and uncomfortable to
watch. It is often said that
Taylor's choreography consists of
exploiting a minimal repertoire of
movements, and this quality was
in evidence in American Genesis.
There was much tedious and
contorted activity as the obscure
melodrama unfolded.
Stage Crowded
Part of the problem with the
performance may have been that

the stage was entirely too small
for so many dancers. This has the
effect of making the production
seem more amateurish than it was.
One redeeming interlude in the
long evening was the section "So
Long Eden," where Adam, Eve,
and a third character bounced a
small red ball, the forbidden fruit,
in a playful game, all the while
dancing a sort of rhythmic folk
dance step that complemented
John Fahey's music in a delightful
way. The dancers looked
reassuringly comfortable and
confident with the movement,

especially Ruby Shang, who
provided the perfect mixture of
seductiveness and innocence as
Eve.
American Genesis points up
the fact that Paul Taylor has
become too stiff and heavy to
dance with the nimble grace that
he commanded even a few years
ago. The lesson learned was that
temporary retrogression is a real
possibility for the artist in dance;
having once been in the
avant-garde does not preclude a
choreographer's descent to the
rear ranks.

fifteen minute interval between
the raising and lowering of the
stage curtain.
In these works, Taylor's
purpose was not to shock or
offend; rather, he was concerned
with exploring the choreographic
limits of dance. Throughout the
1950s and early '60s Taylor
continued to present works that
forced audiences to reexamine
what dance and movement were
all about.
Excitement, Outrage Missing
It was an understandable
disappointment Saturday night
when Taylor's newest
choreographic effort, American
Genesis, failed to generate any of
the excitement or outrage of his
earlier works. The piece is a
collection of five dances centered,
quizically enough, around biblical
themes, the dancers alternately
assuming roles such as Cain, Abel,
Adam, Eve, Noah, etc.
The costuming was garish, with

Taylor and others frequently
appearing in Quaker-style coats
and hats, and the movement was
correspondingly tortuous,
uninspired, and uncomfortable to
watch. It is often said that
Taylor's choreography consists of
exploiting a minimal repertoire of
movements, and this quality was
in evidence in American Genesis.
There was much tedious and
contorted activity as the obscure
melodrama unfolded.
Stage Crowded
Part of the problem with the
performance may have been that

the stage was entirely too small
for so many dancers. This has the
effect of making the production
seem more amateurish than it was.
One redeeming interlude in the
long evening was the section "So
Long Eden," where Adam, Eve,
and a third character bounced a
small red ball, the forbidden fruit,
in a playful game, all the while
dancing a sort of rhythmic folk
dance step that complemented
John Fahey's music in a delightful
way. The dancers looked
reassuringly comfortable and
confident with the movement,

especially Ruby Shang, who
provided the perfect mixture of
seductiveness and innocence as
Eve.
American Genesis points up
the fact that Paul Taylor has
become too stiff and heavy to
dance with the nimble grace that
he commanded even a few years
ago. The lesson learned was that
temporary retrogression is a real
possibility for the artist in dance;
having once been in the
avant-garde does not preclude a
choreographer's descent to the
rear ranks.
SAN JOSE — Last Saturday
night at San Jose State, an artistic
truth was demonstrated. The
occasion was a performance by
the Paul Taylor Dance Company,
and the truth was that even a
talented choreographer can flop.
Taylor is not new to the dance
scene. He began choreographing
and performing twenty years ago
in New York, and since then he
has had a varied and lively career,
both as a soloist in the companies
of Merce Cunningham and Martha
Graham, and as head of his own
New York-based company.
Very early in his career, Taylor
distinguished himself as a
choreographic crazy man. He was
the first choreographer to
introduce a dog on stage as part of
a dance performance, and he
further shocked New York
audiences by presenting Untitled
Duet, a dance where two dancers
remained motionless for the
fifteen minute interval between
the raising and lowering of the
stage curtain.
