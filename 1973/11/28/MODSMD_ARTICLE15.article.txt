# Moon Eclipsed In Who Concert
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
BRISBANE - The Who were
performing an excellent concert
before a sellout crowd of 13,500
at the Cow Palace last Tuesday
night until the Moon went out.
After the group had performed
for about an hour and a half,
drummer Keith Moon suddenly
passed out at the end of a rousing
rendition of "Won't Get Fooled
Again."
An abrupt 25 minute
intermission followed while a
doctor tried to get Moon back
into playing condition.
Moon returned to play one
more song but collapsed again,
and after the remaining three
musicians played another song
with Moon slumped over his
drums, he retired for the night.
The Who attempted to go on,
performing with a drummer
plucked out of the audience who
did a truly remarkable job
considering he had never played
with the group before, but their
spirit seemed to be gone and the
concert fizzled out after two more
songs. There was no encore.
Some Disappointment
The Who performed for a total
of two hours and played
extremely well, but many people
left disappointed. A true
super-group like the Who is
expected to create an event rather
than simply perform a concert;
unfortunately, that necessary kind
of energy just wasn't in the air.
Part of the problem was that
the Who didn't play very many of
their most popular songs. It's hard
to tell whether the concert was
significantly abbreviated by

Moon's departure, but it is
possible that the group was just
about to launch into a
crowd-pleasing string of hits when
Moon was eclipsed.
The show began with what lead
singer Roger Daltrey described as
"some of our old favorites."
These included the much-recorded
"Summertime Blues," which all
fans of themovie Woodstock
remember well, and "My
Generation," one of the first
songs to bring the Who
recognition in 1965.
Trademark Stage Presence
Some of the famous Who
gyrations were evident from the
start, such as Daltrey's
never-ending microphone twisting
when he wasn't singing and
guitarist Pete Townshend's
well-known leaping.
The group then moved onto its
new double album, Quadrophenia,
whose songs provided the bulk of
the concert.
Written entirely by group
leader Townshend, Quadrophenia,
is the story of a young guy in
England named Jimmy who gets
fed up with his life in the city and
takes off for the ocean at
Brighton. According to the album
notes, Jimmy is supposed to be a
composite of all four Who
members.
Tapes Augment Live Sound
Using tape decks and a
quadrophonic speaker system to
produce some of Quadrophenia's
elaborate sound effects, the Who
played about three-fourths of the
album, beginning with "The Real
Me," a song which shows off
Daltrey's excellent voice well and
is perhaps the group's best new
rocker.
But surassing Daltrey's singing
is Twonshend's extraordinary
guitar playing. Especially
considering that he is the group's
only guitarist, he is absolutely
remarkable.
"The Real Me" was followed
by another fine song from the
album, "The Punk Meets the
Godfather," in which the
quadrophonic sound effects were
used perfectly.
Townshend Sings
Townshend himself displayed a
good voice while singing parts of
the song "I'm One," although his
voice doesn't stand out as

Daltrey's does.
The group moved through the
strange "Helpless Dancer," which
sounds almost theatrical, and the
less exceptional rocker "5:15,"
before doing a superb version of
"Sea and Sand" â€” an excellent
song with good slow-to-fast rhthm
changes.
Moon's considerable drumming
talents were noticeable on
"Drowned" mainly because his
drumming was the only
memorable part of the song.
Rock Activates Crowd
The crowd, which was
relatively immobile during most
of the playing of Quadrophenia,
came alive with "Bell Hop" and
began to rock with the music.
The Who finished off the
album with "Doctor Jimmy," and
a forceful rendition of "Love,
Rer'gn O'er Me," an emotional,
pleading song, with Townshend's
guitar wailing hauntingly.
The speaker system was very
faithful to what the group was
playing and many of the songs
sounded just like the recorded
versions.
Indeed, it was sometimes hard
to tell when the Who were playing
their own instruments live and
when they were using
pre-recorded sound effects.
During "Won't Get Fooled
Again," which immediately
followed Quadrophenia the
moog-produced wah-wah sound
which runs all through the song

didn't seem to be coming from
the stage.
Old, New Tunes Finish
After Moon was revived the
first time, the Who returned with
"Magic Bus," an older song that
was one of their few AM radio
hits, and, after Moon's second
collapse, "See Me, Feel Me," the
only cut they performed from the
rock opera Tommy.
They finished with two
unfamiliar songs aided by their
newly recruited drummer, closing
with something of a whimper.
A group named Lynyrd
Skynyrd from Jacksonville, Fla.
opened the show with a
competent half-hour set which
went unappreciated by the
impatient crowd.
