# 'Massacre' Pretentious, Moralistic
## The 						Stanford Daily Entertainment 
### ED HARRIS 
If you don't enjoy reading irate
film critics, I suggest you turn to
the sports page and read
something more cheerful. What
follows is not so much a review as
a warning: do not trespass into
any theater where Massacre In
Rome is playing under penalty of
boredom and/or disgust. The film
is a pretentious heap of moral
claptrap.
The massacre of the title refers
to the Adreatine Massacre of May
24, 1944, in which 335 Italians
were executed in reprisal for 32
SS men who were killed the day
before in an attack by Italian
partisans. The film attempts to
convey the soul-searching (or lack
thereof) of the bureaucrats who
were ordered to carry out the
reprisal, but fails.
George Pan Cosmatos, the
director, who was an assistant to
Costa-Gavras in the filming of Z,
retains all the ingredients of his
master's style — the melodramatic
pseudo-documentary (derived in

turn from Pontecorvo),
tight-lipped and fast-paced —
without generating any of the
spirit of suspense and immediacy
that made Z and State of Siege so
compelling. Where Costa-Gavras'
editing is crisp, precise, and ironic,

Pan Cosmatos' editing is sloppy
and heavy-handed.
Ostensibly Leftist
Just like Costa-Gavras, Pan
Cosmatos ostensibly espouses
leftist views, yet his method of
portraying history is totally
bourgeois right-wing. Instead of
showing the audience how the
common people suffer from the
injustices of the Nazis, Pan
Cosmatos chooses to tell the story

the real heros of the incident,
remain unknown, huddled into a
mass and shot (both actually and
cinematically) like a herd of
cattle. Pan Cosmatos is about as
sensitive to the bewilderment and
suffering of the individual victims

of a few of the leaders.
The victims of the massacre,
as the Nazis were; their names are
listed at the end of the film as so
many statistics in a ledger.
A good Soviet director like
Eisenstein would have maintained
a strict dialectic between the
people of the working class and
their masters, building effective
contrasts between their
existences. Pan Cosmatos show us
only the bureaucrats who mutter
portentously about being "driven
by history," but who more closely
resemble historical marionettes

who jerk and twist this way and
that with every whim of events.
Priest Role Believable
The most human character in
the film is father Pietro, played by
Marcello Mastroianni, who
single-handedly tries to head off

the massacre despite the
indifference of his Catholic
superiors. The idea for this role
was stolen from Rossellini's Citta
Aperta (a much better film made
on a much smaller budget) and
like most imitations is inferior to
the original. We never see Father
Pietro with his congregation; he is
a myopic art scholar who talks
about "the people" but is never
seen with them. (He even steals a
bicycle from a poor worker
without stopping to give him an
explanation.)
The Nazi cliches are

inexcusable. The commandant
(Leo McKem who played the mad
priest in Help\ and who is equally
plausible here) throws temper
tantrums and slobbers over sleazy
women. The SS men drink brandy
and eat caviar between cynical
comments on the cheapness of
human life (especially Jewish life)
and are all art snobs. All
caricatures imply humorous
exaggeration, but this becomes a
slapstick that cheapens the whole
tone of the film.
How Richard Burton, as
Colonel Kappler, ever wandered
onto the set of this fiasco God
only knows. The program notes
record Burton as saying "I read
the script and I wanted to do it."
I suspect that his original words
were more like "Before I read the
script, I had to do it."
