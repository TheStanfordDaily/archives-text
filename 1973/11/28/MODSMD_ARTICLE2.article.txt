# Lyman Raps Council On Development Veto
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman last night
blasted an attempt by the Palo Alto
City Council to obtain veto power
over University academic
development.
At its Monday meeting, the Council
voted 7-2 to ask the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission and
Board of Supervisors to enact a zoning
ordinance which would force Stanford
to apply for city approval before
beginning construction projects.
Speaking on Campus Conference, a
KZSU Public Affairs program, Lyman
sought to correct several major
inaccuracies in an article in yesterday's
Daily on the Council action.
Lyman said the city proposal would
cover "most of the flat land that is
available to the University on the
campus side of Junipero Serra.
"In effect, the city has moved to
gain control of the only major
remaining area in which the University
can expand its academic operations
short of Junipero Serra Boulevard," he
argued.
Lyman objected to the modified
plan finally approved by the Council:
"It's not a compromise in principle,
it's a compromise in acreage. They are
saying 'we want to establish the
principle that we control Stanford's
academic development in those areas
in which we happen to have an
interest.'
"Once that principle is established,
we see nothing that would stop them
from expanding, on the basis of the
principle, so that they in effect control
the academic development of the
University," he continued.
Lyman conceded that the
University now has and would like to
keep a blanket "use permit" from the
county, which allows Stanford to
build without government review and
approval.
But he said Stanford does not argue
that it has "some God-given right" to
the blanket permit, or that the
University "should be immunized

from all public control."
He would not say whether Stanford
would resist a proposal to remove the
blanket permit. It would then have to
apply to the County Planning
Commission for approval of each
construction project.
The University objects strenuously
to the proposed ordinance because it
would regulate academic development,
not because it affects the industrial
park and faculty housing areas, the
president emphasized.
He criticized city officials for
failing to consider a University offer to
provide oajrly notice of construction
plans. "We've been offering to consult
until we're blue in the face," he said.

UNIVERSITY SEMINAR — General Secretary Daryl Pearson, speaking at a
seminar to help Stanford fund-raising volunteers understand the University,
warned yesterday that the dropping stock market may interfere with the $300
million Campaign for Stanford. Pearson said individual donors will receive less of
a if their stock loses value, and may not give as much for this reason.
Stocks comprise 75 percent of individual donations, he added.
