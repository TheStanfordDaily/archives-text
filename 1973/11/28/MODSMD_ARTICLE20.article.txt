W.C. FIELDS BY HIMSELF

Christmas, 1973, marks the
twenty-seventh anniversary of the
death of one of America's best
loved and best known comics,
W.C. Fields, as well as the release
of a book which his grandson, the
author, calls "the autobiography
that W.C. Fields would have
written."
Ronaid J. Fields says his work
is a "definitive book on W.C. —
not padded out with anecdotes
and reminiscences that cry for
credibility, but rather a portrait of
W.C. as he perceived himself."
Actually, the book is neither a
biography nor an autobiography
in the strictest sense of those
words. Rather, it is a compilation
of letters, scripts, sketches, and
comedy ideas that Fields came up
with in his 66 years of life.
The book covers the full range
of Fields' life, from his famous
vaudeville juggling acts to a later
letter firing his secretary, written
from a sanitarium shortly before
his death. From beginning to end
the material reveals the
astounding wit and caustic humor
that reflects much of the
bitterness in Fields' private life.
One of the funniest pieces in
the volume is entitled "Alcohol
Has Taken the Place of the Dog as
Man's Best Friend." As evidence
of this hypothesis, Fields points
to fox hunts: "The whole theory
of fox hunting is plainly just an
excuse to take a drink. What can
you do with a fox even if you
happen to catch one? Very little.
"For all practical purposes he
is as useless as a dog," Fields
continues. "A dog will run up and
lick your hand. No bottle will ever
do that. If the whiskey ever starts
licking your hand, I would advise
that you lay off of it for a while,
say five or 10 minutes."
New Photos, Scripts
For those of us used to seeing
Fields in tails and a top hat on
aged celluloid, the book also
contains a number of excellent
pictures that show what he really
looked like. (He even has on a
swimsuit in a few, for a truly
revealing look at "The Great
One.") The volume also contains a
number of heretofore unpublished
movie scripts that are equal to any
of those that made Fields famous.
As entertaining and revealing as
this volume is, it still falls short of
its potential. With the wealth of
material available to Ron Fields as
W.C.'s grandson, it's not
necessarily his fault that the book
is as good as it is. In fact, he

should have come up with more
than just an annotated collection
of papers that he's trying to pass
off as an autobiography.
The book has a number of
problems, some of which are
mechanical. The book is badly
organized. It is partially
chronological, but breaks down
into departmentalizing about
two-thirds of the way through.
Because of the poor organization,
there is no possibility of an index.
Once you've read something,
there is only one way to find it
again — leaf through the book
until you happen upon it.
Poor Selection of Letters
Other problems are a matter of
approach. The author's selection
of material (or lack thereof)
makes an entertaining and tightly
written 400-page volume into a
500-page, slow-reading one. Most
of the letters from Fields to his
wife written during his vaudeville
years chastice her for wasting her
weekly allowance. One or two of
these would have sufficed, but the
book contains a beleaguering
superfluity of these letters.
The biggest problem with this
book is that it should have been a
biography, combining what is in it
now with other sources. Ron
Fields should have been
forewarned by his father's
admonition in writing his
biography of W.C. "To date, there
has not been a biography worthy
of the name, since none of the
authors ever gleaned what they
should have from our family."
In this area, Ron Fields copped
out too. He fails to rise to the
challenge to take on the task of
ferreting out stories that, in his
own words,"cry for credibility."

Instead he gives us the most
unreliable of the accounts we can
have of a man's life (short of
those of his enemies and friends
taken alone) — his own. This book

inherently gives us a new
incredibility.
It's worth reading, but at $10 a
copy, wait until you find it in the
library.
