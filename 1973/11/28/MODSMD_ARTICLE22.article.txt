# Shuffling The Cards
## Roses In Stanford Future? 
### Dave Robinson 
Stanford won't be going to the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day, but Cardinal coach Jack
Christiansen hasn't been ranting, raving and crying
the past few days like Michigan coach Bo
Schembechler.
Instead, it's been a period of quiet reflection for
Christiansen, who guided Stanford to a surprisingly
successful 7-4 season and now has as much right to
think about Rose Bowl, 1975 as Michigan's angry
Schembechler.
It's true that Stanford was thumped by the
Wolverines 47-10 earlier this year. It's also true that
the Cards absorbed embarrassing thrashings at the
hands of Penn State and UCLA. But those defeats
were long ago, and after winning five of their last six
games, some of the younger Cardinals are already
thinking about spring practice.
"I'm really enthused about next year," said
junior fullback Scott Laidlaw only moments after
he had rushed for 132 yards Saturday against
California. "We've got a lot of talent returning, and
some good players coming up from the JVs — I
won't have an easy time keeping my job."
It's doubtful that Laidlaw will be bumped from
the lineup, but there's no question that Stanford
will enter the 1974 season with a surplus of talent.
"There are only three unknown areas," Christiansen
said. "Quarterback, the secondary and field goal
kicking."
Talent And Depth
The rest of the squad returns virtually intact.
Laidlaw will start at fullback, with Ron Inge and Sig
Ostrom battling for the other running back spot.
The receiving corps is also strong, as Bill Singler,
Eric Test, Tony Hill and Brad Williams all return.
And the offensive line, which "improved
tremendously all year," according to Christiansen,
loses only center Bill Reid and guard Bruce
Blackstone.
Tackles Keith Rowen and Todd Anderson,
guards Gary Anderson and Alex Karakozoff and
center Rudy Bergthold return from a unit
Christiansen said "spent more time on the football
field than anybody else — and that's not standing
around time; it was working time" under line coach

Hudson Houck.
Defensively, Roger Still well and Pat Donovan
will once again anchor the three-man line, with
Drew Palin the leading candidate to take over the
middle guard spot shared this year by Pete Hanson
and Joe Martin.
The four linebackers — Gordy Riegel, Forrie
Martin, Geb Church and John Snider — will be all
back. Riegel and Martin got most of the publicity
this year, but Chris complimented all four
linebackers, and was "particularly pleased" with the
play of Snider.
Now, back to the weaknesses.
Quarterback Development
"The main thing that has to come along is our
quarterback situation," Christiansen said. "I have
confidence in all our quarterback candidates [Mike
Cordova, Jerry Waldvogel and Guy Benjamin], but
inexperience will obviously hurt."
Whoever starts will face the unenviable task of
pleasing Stanford's spoiled fans, who have spent the
past six seasons watching (and often booing)
brilliant signal-callers Jim Plunkett, Don Bunce and
Mike Boryla.
The other main weaknesses are field goal kicking,
where the coaching staff may have to resort to a
massive kicking caravan to replace NCAA
record-holder Rod Garcia, and the depleted
secondary, which Christiansen hopes to replenish
with some junior college transfers.
"We're definitely looking at some JC players "or
immediate help," Chris said, "but we have some
good talent of our own in Doc Blanchard, Gerald
Wilson, Roland Young and Jeff Siemens."
The main strength of next year's team could be
its maturity and poise. The same players that
miraculously turned disaster into success in 1973
will be back next year — all a year older, a year
smarter and hopefully a year better.
Last fall, Christiansen would have "jumped at the
chance to take a 7-4 record before the season
started and not play anybody."
If offered the same option next year, though, he
just might refuse.

successful 7-4 season and now has as much right to
think about Rose Bowl, 1975 as Michigan's angry
Schembechler.
It's true that Stanford was thumped by the
Wolverines 47-10 earlier this year. It's also true that
the Cards absorbed embarrassing thrashings at the
hands of Penn State and UCLA. But those defeats
were long ago, and after winning five of their last six
games, some of the younger Cardinals are already
thinking about spring practice.
"I'm really enthused about next year," said
junior fullback Scott Laidlaw only moments after
he had rushed for 132 yards Saturday against
California. "We've got a lot of talent returning, and
some good players coming up from the JVs — I
won't have an easy time keeping my job."
It's doubtful that Laidlaw will be bumped from
the lineup, but there's no question that Stanford
will enter the 1974 season with a surplus of talent.
"There are only three unknown areas," Christiansen
said. "Quarterback, the secondary and field goal
kicking."
Talent And Depth
The rest of the squad returns virtually intact.
Laidlaw will start at fullback, with Ron Inge and Sig
Ostrom battling for the other running back spot.
The receiving corps is also strong, as Bill Singler,
Eric Test, Tony Hill and Brad Williams all return.
And the offensive line, which "improved
tremendously all year," according to Christiansen,
loses only center Bill Reid and guard Bruce
Blackstone.
Tackles Keith Rowen and Todd Anderson,
guards Gary Anderson and Alex Karakozoff and
center Rudy Bergthold return from a unit
Christiansen said "spent more time on the football
field than anybody else — and that's not standing
around time; it was working time" under line coach

Hudson Houck.
Defensively, Roger Still well and Pat Donovan
will once again anchor the three-man line, with
Drew Palin the leading candidate to take over the
middle guard spot shared this year by Pete Hanson
and Joe Martin.
The four linebackers — Gordy Riegel, Forrie
Martin, Geb Church and John Snider — will be all
back. Riegel and Martin got most of the publicity
this year, but Chris complimented all four
linebackers, and was "particularly pleased" with the
play of Snider.
Now, back to the weaknesses.
Quarterback Development
"The main thing that has to come along is our
quarterback situation," Christiansen said. "I have
confidence in all our quarterback candidates [Mike
Cordova, Jerry Waldvogel and Guy Benjamin], but
inexperience will obviously hurt."
Whoever starts will face the unenviable task of
pleasing Stanford's spoiled fans, who have spent the
past six seasons watching (and often booing)
brilliant signal-callers Jim Plunkett, Don Bunce and
Mike Boryla.
The other main weaknesses are field goal kicking,
where the coaching staff may have to resort to a
massive kicking caravan to replace NCAA
record-holder Rod Garcia, and the depleted
secondary, which Christiansen hopes to replenish
with some junior college transfers.
"We're definitely looking at some JC players "or
immediate help," Chris said, "but we have some
good talent of our own in Doc Blanchard, Gerald
Wilson, Roland Young and Jeff Siemens."
The main strength of next year's team could be
its maturity and poise. The same players that
miraculously turned disaster into success in 1973
will be back next year — all a year older, a year
smarter and hopefully a year better.
Last fall, Christiansen would have "jumped at the
chance to take a 7-4 record before the season
started and not play anybody."
If offered the same option next year, though, he
just might refuse.
Stanford won't be going to the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day, but Cardinal coach Jack
Christiansen hasn't been ranting, raving and crying
the past few days like Michigan coach Bo
Schembechler.
Instead, it's been a period of quiet reflection for
Christiansen, who guided Stanford to a surprisingly
successful 7-4 season and now has as much right to
think about Rose Bowl, 1975 as Michigan's angry
Schembechler.
