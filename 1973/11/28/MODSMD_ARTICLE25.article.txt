## Warrior Revival 
### Don Tollefson 
Hidden like a basketball needle in a football haystack, last week's
remarkable revival of the Golden State Warriors went virtually
unnoticed, except by 16 other teams in the NBA.

In the finest tradition of Bay Area pro sports teams, the Warriors
have always approached, but never achieved greatness. When Rick
Barry was a brash youngster and Nate Thurmond was just beginning
to mature back in the mid-60s, the Warriors seemed destined to be a
preeminent power for years to come. But then the dream soured.
Barry followed the money scent to the ABA and for a number of
years, the Warriors seemed to be expending as much energy in the
courts as on them.
Then last season, like a pardoned ex-con, the Golden Boy returned
to the open arms of the Warriors. But time had taken its toll, both on
Barry and the Warriors. Rick's legs were shakier andalthoughhe could
still score with the best of them, his defensive skills had slid from
inconsistent to near non-existent.
While Barry was adding lustre to the fledgling league, Warriors'
owner Franklin Mieuli acted like a rejected suitor. For years, the
eccentric Mieuli seemed to be doing his best to ignore the same draft
mechanism which had brought Barry to the Warriors.
The Warrior draftees who didn't flee to the ABA did little more
than waste Mieuli's money. Despite the fact that they drafted as
poorly as the 49ers did, the Warriors remained competitive. And last
year there was the promise of fulfillment of a long-delayed dream,
when Barry joined with Cazzie Russell to give the Warriors perhaps
the most offensively potent pair of forwards in the league.
The Warriors' optimism of a year ago did not rest on the shooting
arms of Barry and Russell alone. Thurmond had developed into
perhaps the league's finest all-around center. Forward Clyde Lee had
improved remarkably to become a devastating offensive rebounder.
Guard Jeff Mullins was now a consistent all-star performer. Add to
this the often brilliant, if inconsistent, play of guard Jim Barnett and
swing man Joe Ellis, as well as the superb coaching of A 1 Attles and
you had the ingredients of a potential championship team.
The Warriors came close. Some observers felt that if the Warriors
had had another consistent guard, they would've won it all. When
veteran Lennie Wilkens became available last year, many people
thought he could be the key to a Warriorchampionship. But Wilkens
ended up in Cleveland and the Warriors ended up losing to the Lakers
in the Western Conference finals.

This season the Warriors got
off to an unsteady start. And
when Lee injured his knee two
weeks ago, the locals seemed
destined to hover around the .500
mark indefinitely and watch the
Lakers pull away. So when the
Warriors began a five-game road
trip a week ago, one writer said,
"it may be a journey to disaster."
But in quick succession, the
Warriors beat Milwaukee, Atlanta,
Philadelphia and New York,
despite the fact that Mullins
missed the Knicks game and Barry
missed half of the Hawks game
and all of the 76ers game.
Finding reasons for the team's
turnaround is difficult, but the
performances of sophomore guard
Charlie Johnson, rookie forward
Derrek Dickey and guard Butch
Beard, who was obtained in a
trade for the infinitely expendable
Mahdi Abdul-Rahman, cannot be
discounted.
Perhaps most importantly, this
trip has proven that the Warriors
can compete with the best in the
league under less-than-optimal
conditions. The self-confidence
gained from this remarkable road
trip could have a major effect on
the team's future. In their own
division, the Warriors still must
contend with a Laker team that
has overcome the loss of Wilt
Chamberlain through the play of
Elmore Smith and Connie
Hawkins. Getting by the Lakers
won't be easy, but the Warriors
can now truly count themselves
among the NBA's elite.
