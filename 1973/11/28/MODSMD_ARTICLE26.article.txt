# New Life For Old Shoes
## Tred 2 Company Saves Athletic Soles 
### BOB OTTILIE 
Last year, Pat Connolly was a computer
systems analyst and Rory Fuerst was having
trouble with his athletic shoes. Today they are
the general manager and president of Tred 2,
the Palo Alt j business that resoles aging
athletic shoes.
At first glance it may sound like an unusual
occupation for two college graduates, but
Fuerst and Connolly are bent on
revolutionizing the shoe repair business.
Surprisingly, for a venture that began in
earnest only this past summer, Tred 2 has all
the business it can handle.
Connolly sees many factors creating a
market for the resoling of the light-weight
European shoes. He explained that shoes he
bought last year for $14-$lB are now selling
from $22-$3O as a result of the devaluation of
the dollar and the increase in the price of
leather and rubber. Since the soles usually
wear out first, the life of a shoe can be
doubled at less than half the price of a new
pair if repaired properly.
It was Fuerst, a graduate of the University
of San Francisco, who initiated the idea as a
result of frustrating experiences with his own
shoes. He had been studying the market, and
decided the timing was right. Connolly was
courting Fuerst's sister at the time (they are
now married) and became interested. He had
recently graduated from the Stanford School
of Business and had some managerial
experience.
The first year was one of experiment for
the young industry. This summer the go ahead
was given for full production. [The two

incorporated as the American Athletic Shoe
Corporation and are now located in the blue
and white brick building at 111 Homer
Avenue.] The results have been
overwhelming. At the present rate, nearly
15,000 pairs of shoes will be resoled in the
first year. A nationwide advertising campaign
began with advertisements in such magazines
as Sports Illustrated, Track and Field News
and World Tennis.
Fifty locations in the Bay Area alone serve
as drop spots for the shoes and plans call for
more at colleges, sport shops and athletic
clubs throughout California. As of this week,
the Stanford Book Store will serve as a drop
spot for students who wish to have their
athletic shoes resoled. Cost of the work is a
standard $9.95. Shoes can also be left off at
the factory, which is open weekdays from 8
am. to 6 p.m. and most Saturdays.
Connolly sees yearly production increasing.
"We hope in the next year to do about 50,000
pairs and the year after 100,000 pairs."
Hopefully they should then be able to branch
out, locating factories in various areas of the
country.
Besides Fuerst and Connolly, two other
individuals have played a key role in the
company's development. Steve Brandt, a
professor at the Stanford School of Business
serves as the chairman of the board. Larry
King, husband of tennis great Billie Jean King,
is a director.
A worn pair of shoes left for repair will
have its old soles completely removed before
new ones are applied. 95 percent of the new
soles are the same as the originals, with the

remaining 5 percent being qualitative
substitutes.
Connolly stresses that only the soles are
actually repaired. However, some repairs are
done to the top of the shoe during the
process of replacing the sole. "We do minor
repairs such as sewing rips, etc. to the upper
part of the shoe to make sure it lasts as long as
the new sole."
Tred 2 employs 14 people with a steady
work force of 11. Each worker specializes on
a specific type of shoe, which include Adidas,
Tretorn, Puma, Nike, Head, Hyde and
Hummel. Other employees perform only a
single task such as sewing. Most of the
employees have had 3-6 years experience
working with leather.
The volume of athletic shoes sold in this
country has been increasing steadily in the
past few years, especially the European
Brands, which are famous for their light
weight and comfort. The increase has been
due in part to the rise in popularity of tennis
and jogging and increased disposable income.
Add to this the fact that athletic shoes
have become accepted as everyday footwear
and you naturally have a tremendous volume
of sales. It is remarkable that the companies
would be willing to sell soles to what would
have to be labeled as competitors.
"Manufacturers have always been willing to
cooperate because of our high quality of work
and good service. They see their shoes pricing
themselves out of the market and the fact that
they can be resoled is an added potential for
them," Connolly explained.

market for the resoling of the light-weight
European shoes. He explained that shoes he
bought last year for $14-$lB are now selling
from $22-$3O as a result of the devaluation of
the dollar and the increase in the price of
leather and rubber. Since the soles usually
wear out first, the life of a shoe can be
doubled at less than half the price of a new
pair if repaired properly.
It was Fuerst, a graduate of the University
of San Francisco, who initiated the idea as a
result of frustrating experiences with his own
shoes. He had been studying the market, and
decided the timing was right. Connolly was
courting Fuerst's sister at the time (they are
now married) and became interested. He had
recently graduated from the Stanford School
of Business and had some managerial
experience.
The first year was one of experiment for
the young industry. This summer the go ahead
was given for full production. [The two

incorporated as the American Athletic Shoe
Corporation and are now located in the blue
and white brick building at 111 Homer
Avenue.] The results have been
overwhelming. At the present rate, nearly
15,000 pairs of shoes will be resoled in the
first year. A nationwide advertising campaign
began with advertisements in such magazines
as Sports Illustrated, Track and Field News
and World Tennis.
Fifty locations in the Bay Area alone serve
as drop spots for the shoes and plans call for
more at colleges, sport shops and athletic
clubs throughout California. As of this week,
the Stanford Book Store will serve as a drop
spot for students who wish to have their
athletic shoes resoled. Cost of the work is a
standard $9.95. Shoes can also be left off at
the factory, which is open weekdays from 8
am. to 6 p.m. and most Saturdays.
Connolly sees yearly production increasing.
"We hope in the next year to do about 50,000
pairs and the year after 100,000 pairs."
Hopefully they should then be able to branch
out, locating factories in various areas of the
country.
Besides Fuerst and Connolly, two other
individuals have played a key role in the
company's development. Steve Brandt, a
professor at the Stanford School of Business
serves as the chairman of the board. Larry
King, husband of tennis great Billie Jean King,
is a director.
A worn pair of shoes left for repair will
have its old soles completely removed before
new ones are applied. 95 percent of the new
soles are the same as the originals, with the

remaining 5 percent being qualitative
substitutes.
Connolly stresses that only the soles are
actually repaired. However, some repairs are
done to the top of the shoe during the
process of replacing the sole. "We do minor
repairs such as sewing rips, etc. to the upper
part of the shoe to make sure it lasts as long as
the new sole."
Tred 2 employs 14 people with a steady
work force of 11. Each worker specializes on
a specific type of shoe, which include Adidas,
Tretorn, Puma, Nike, Head, Hyde and
Hummel. Other employees perform only a
single task such as sewing. Most of the
employees have had 3-6 years experience
working with leather.
The volume of athletic shoes sold in this
country has been increasing steadily in the
past few years, especially the European
Brands, which are famous for their light
weight and comfort. The increase has been
due in part to the rise in popularity of tennis
and jogging and increased disposable income.
Add to this the fact that athletic shoes
have become accepted as everyday footwear
and you naturally have a tremendous volume
of sales. It is remarkable that the companies
would be willing to sell soles to what would
have to be labeled as competitors.
"Manufacturers have always been willing to
cooperate because of our high quality of work
and good service. They see their shoes pricing
themselves out of the market and the fact that
they can be resoled is an added potential for
them," Connolly explained.
Last year, Pat Connolly was a computer
systems analyst and Rory Fuerst was having
trouble with his athletic shoes. Today they are
the general manager and president of Tred 2,
the Palo Alt j business that resoles aging
athletic shoes.
At first glance it may sound like an unusual
occupation for two college graduates, but
Fuerst and Connolly are bent on
revolutionizing the shoe repair business.
Surprisingly, for a venture that began in
earnest only this past summer, Tred 2 has all
the business it can handle.
