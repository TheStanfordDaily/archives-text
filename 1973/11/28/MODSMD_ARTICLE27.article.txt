# Players Set High Goals For Cardinal Basketball
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The two biggest men on the
biggest basketball team in
Stanford history believe the squad
will win "at least 20 games" this
season. Seven-foot center Rich
Kelley, 6-11 forward Tim
Patterson and their teammates
open the year against
Nevada-Reno Friday at 8 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
Kelley, who last season won
fi/st team All-Pacific Eight
honors, said the team is "playing a
lot better together like we did at
the end of last season, and playing
with a lot less turnovers.
"If we can keep the turnovers
down to around 10 or 15 a game,
shoot a good percentage and be
patient, I think we're going to
have a pretty good year," said the
junior from Menlo Park.
Last season the Cardinals
averaged 18 turnovers a game â€”
one reason they lost seven games
by seven points or less. Stanford
finished the season with a 14-11
record, its best in six years.
Scott Trobbe, the 6-6 junior
who should start at forward
Friday, said, "We lost a lot of
games last year because of
inexperience and that shouldn't
happen this season. We've all got a
year behind us in experience and
we all know what the other guy is
going to do."

Most players cite experience as
the most important factor in
assessing the Cardinals' prospects
this season. Junior Melvin
Arterberry, a 6-3'/2 guard from
Los Angeles,said, "Last year most
of us were sophomores and in our
first year playing college
basketball on the varsity level. I
think a few of us.were in awe of
people like [UCLA's Bill] Walton
and [Keith] Wilkes. But we've
played against them and now we
know they're human."
Last season at Pauley Pavilion,
Stanford came closer than any
other team to beating the NCAA
champion Bruins. The Cards led
UCLA 25-18 at the half, but fell
51-45 after an overwhelming
Bruin rally in the opening minutes
of the second half.
Sophomore forward Ed
Schweitzer, speaking more
optimistically than his teammates,
said: "We have a good chance
against UCLA." The 6-8%
Schweitzer also pointed to the
experience of the Stanford squad,
saying "we're playing a lot more
as a unit this year."
Kelley expects UCLA to top
the Pac-8 again this year, and said
"if they run away with it, there's
going to be a real dogfight for
second and third because of the
good opportunities for
post-season play." USC and
Oregon should be Stanford's
primary competition for the
second spot.
The Pac-8 runnerup will play in
the first annual Collegiate
Commissioner's tournament, with
the third and fourth place teams
still eligible for the NIT in New
York.
According to Kelley, the
team's experience will be of
special importance on defense.
"We have about five or six
different defenses we can throw at
a team. It took us a long time last
year to get used to them and feel
comfortable with them, but this
year we're already feeling
comfortable.
"We'll be able to switch a lot
during the course of a game,

whereas last year we usually had
to stick with one or two
defenses," Kelley added. "That
will help confuse the opponents."
Patterson said Stanford is
"going to have to be a stronger
rebounding team this year if we're
going to go anywhere. Last year
we really weren't a dominating
board team even though we had
the height."
In evaluating his teammates,
Patterson said "Kelley is as steady
as ever," and added that "there's
been noticeable improvement in
the play of Arterberry and [guard
Jim] Montague. Trobbe is doing
well on defense, on the boards
and shooting well lately."
According to Patterson, senior
forward Dave Frost "just lately
has been a real scoring machine in
practice."
Stanford will face a nationally
ranked team for the first time
Monday at 8 p.m. in Maples when
the Cards face the Dons of the
University of San Francisco,
ranked from seventh to 11th in
various pre-season polls.
