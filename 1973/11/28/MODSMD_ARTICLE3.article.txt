# Administrators, Student Leaders Debate ASSU Senate Concerns
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
University administrators and
members of the student government
disagree on what the concerns of the
ASSU Senate should be.
Administrators think the Senate
should limit itself to student concerns
directly related to the University and
handle politically charged issues more
carefully, while most student leaders
seem to think the Senate should
express itself on national issues like
impeachment and "sensitive" issues
such as the University's plan to move
the office of the assistant to the
president for chicano affairs.
Dale Snape, assistant to the dean of
Student Affairs, criticized the Senate
for a lack of clear guidelines of what it
intends to do. He said that last year's
Senate knew that it was working on
student services and "made a serious
attempt to act on them."
The actions of this year's Senate
have been disjointed and without
guidelines, Snape said. He expressed

his fear that this Senate will jeopardize
its effectiveness by widening its scope
of concerns too much.
The senators have created "an air of
politicalization" about themselves by
passing "crisis-oriented" resolutions
and also by "sticking to their media
trip," Snape said.
He suggested that instead of passing
resolutions which "sound good on
KZSU and in the Daily," the Senate
should take more time to carefully
study and appraise issues.
However, ASSU President Kevin
O'Grady disagreed that politicization
will hurt the Senate. When University
officials say they object to
politicization they're saying they want
the Senate to steer away from
controversial issues, O'Grady said.
O'Grady defended the Senate's
concern about national issues and its
impeachment resolution. It's very
difficult to say that national issues do
not directly affect students, O'Grady
said. What Nixon is doing has a direct
affect on anyone in the country
whether or not he lives within the
borders of a university campus, he
asserted.
The question of internal and
external politics is mainly a matter of
money, according to some senators.
ASSU money should be spent clearly
on student services, Sen. Mike Herman
said. He said he voted for the Senate
resolutions supporting the United
Farmworkers and the impeachment of
Nixon, but he would oppose any
appropriation for them or any other
proposal not directly concerning the
students.
Disagreement over the scope of
Senate's concerns results partially
from feelings about the split in last
year's Senate between what one
senator called "the people who
supported [Peter] Van Petten and the
people who supported O'Grady" in
last year's ASSU presidential elections.
Former ASSU Vice President Brent
Appel, who endorsed O'Grady, said he
sees potential in this Senate partially
because they are willing to tackle
controversial issues.
Appel criticized last year's Senate
as "being controled by a small clique
characterized by cigar smoking and
beer drinking," who would not
concern themselves with controversial
issues, were not serious about doing
their jobs and accomplished little.
However, Rocky Barber, last year's
Senate chairman, disagreed. He said
that the past Senate made a serious

effort to work on student services
"with some progress." To accomplish
this goal, Barber said he purposely
appointed the most conservative
members of the Senate to the finance
committee and pushed for Senate
guidelines for action at the start of the
year.

Former ASSU Vice President Brent
Appel, who endorsed O'Grady, said he
sees potential in this Senate partially
because they are willing to tackle
controversial issues.
Appel criticized last year's Senate
as "being controled by a small clique
characterized by cigar smoking and
beer drinking," who would not
concern themselves with controversial
issues, were not serious about doing
their jobs and accomplished little.
However, Rocky Barber, last year's
Senate chairman, disagreed. He said
that the past Senate made a serious

effort to work on student services
"with some progress." To accomplish
this goal, Barber said he purposely
appointed the most conservative
members of the Senate to the finance
committee and pushed for Senate
guidelines for action at the start of the
year.
University administrators and
members of the student government
disagree on what the concerns of the
ASSU Senate should be.
Administrators think the Senate
should limit itself to student concerns
directly related to the University and
handle politically charged issues more
carefully, while most student leaders
seem to think the Senate should
express itself on national issues like
impeachment and "sensitive" issues
such as the University's plan to move
the office of the assistant to the
president for chicano affairs.
Dale Snape, assistant to the dean of
Student Affairs, criticized the Senate
for a lack of clear guidelines of what it
intends to do. He said that last year's
Senate knew that it was working on
student services and "made a serious
attempt to act on them."
The actions of this year's Senate
have been disjointed and without
guidelines, Snape said. He expressed

his fear that this Senate will jeopardize
its effectiveness by widening its scope
of concerns too much.
The senators have created "an air of
politicalization" about themselves by
passing "crisis-oriented" resolutions
and also by "sticking to their media
trip," Snape said.
He suggested that instead of passing
resolutions which "sound good on
KZSU and in the Daily," the Senate
should take more time to carefully
study and appraise issues.
However, ASSU President Kevin
O'Grady disagreed that politicization
will hurt the Senate. When University
officials say they object to
politicization they're saying they want
the Senate to steer away from
controversial issues, O'Grady said.
O'Grady defended the Senate's
concern about national issues and its
impeachment resolution. It's very
difficult to say that national issues do
not directly affect students, O'Grady
said. What Nixon is doing has a direct
affect on anyone in the country
whether or not he lives within the
borders of a university campus, he
asserted.
The question of internal and
external politics is mainly a matter of
money, according to some senators.
ASSU money should be spent clearly
on student services, Sen. Mike Herman
said. He said he voted for the Senate
resolutions supporting the United
Farmworkers and the impeachment of
Nixon, but he would oppose any
appropriation for them or any other
proposal not directly concerning the
students.
Disagreement over the scope of
Senate's concerns results partially
from feelings about the split in last
year's Senate between what one
senator called "the people who
supported [Peter] Van Petten and the
people who supported O'Grady" in
last year's ASSU presidential elections.
