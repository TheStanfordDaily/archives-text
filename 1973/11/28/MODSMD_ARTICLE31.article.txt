Nixon Tape Played In Publie
WASHINGTON — One of the famed White
House tapes was played in public for the first
time yesterday but the only question it settled
is that there is indeed a humdinger of a hum.
It lasted, as the White House said, 18
minutes and 15 seconds.
To straining ears in U.S. District Judge
John J. Sirica's crowded courtroom, it
sounded like electric clippers in a barber shop,
Here and there, before and after the hum, the
voices of President Nixon and aides John D.
Ehriichman and H.R. Haldeman could be
heard in snatches of conversation.
"What the hell does that show you?" a
voice like the President's said once. "I'd like a
little of that consomme today." The President
again.
There was some whistling — tune and
whistler unidentified.
Then the long buzz, loud at first, then a
little lower and then loud again.
The tape, of a meeting in Nixon's
Executive Office building suite on June 20,
1972 — involving first Ehriichman and then
Haldeman — was played as the President's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was on the
stand.
Woods testified she was listening on
the June 20 tape for signs of Ehriichman
leaving Nixon's office — and that the
Haldeman conversation had already started —
when her telephone rang. As she reached for
the phone — to the left and behind her — she
said she accidentally pushed the record
button. At the same time, she said, her foot
must have been on the foot switch that starts
the tape machine.
After the telephone conversation, she said,
she noticed the record button down, listened
to the tape and discovered the hum. Then, she
said, she told the President who said not to
worry because only the Ehriichman
conversation tape was under subpoena. This
was an erroneous impression according to
prosecutors.
On Nov. 14, as the National Security
Agency was making copies of that tape for the
judge, the 18-minute gap was discovered. Miss
Woods said the President told her of the
length of obliterated conversation.
"I couldn't believe there could be
something like that unless there was a
malfunction in the tape," the red-haired

Woods said.
That left at least 13 minutes of obliterated
conversation unexplained. Experts will assist
Sirica in determining the cause.
Rationing Seen Possible
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration's Cabinet-level energy group is
leaning strongly toward gasoline rationing,
informed sources said after the panel met
yesterday.
Government sources said the
administration, which announced Sunday
night its intention to cut gasoline supplies 15
percent, wants to double that reduction over
the next few months.
The "Emergency Energy Action Group,"
trying to figure out ways to achieve that
reduction, has been considering complete
gasoline rationing, or a 30-to-40-cent gasoline
tax, a combination of both, or maybe the
removal of gasoline price controls.
A source said even Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz, who has favored a gasoline
tax over rationing, appeared to waver in
yesterday's meeting.
The source said no decisions have been
made but there was no enthusiasm for
removing price controls. It was thought that
oil companies could reap windfall profits from
this strategy while gasoline is short and could
' work hardships on consumers who must have
gasoline for essential purposes, the source
said.
The gasoline tax had more support, but the
source said the Cabinet group was
approaching the conclusion that it could not
be adopted fast enough.
Meantime, other sources said the Interior
Secretary Rogers C.3. Morton was on the
verge of leasing federal western lands for
experimental development of oil shale, a
potential source of vast new oil supplies.
United Caneels Flights
WASHINGTON - United Air Lines
announced yesterday it is laying off at least
950 employees beginning Jan. 7 and will
cancel 100 flights in January because of the
fuel shortage.
The company said some of the employees
were notified yesterday that they would be
laid off.
Even more flights will be eliminated in the
next two months, said United President
Edward E. Carlson. But he added he would do
everything possible to keep from laying off
more workers.
Carlson said United, the nation's largest air
carrier, might reduce work hours — and the
pay — of employees rather than furlough
more workers if the shortage worsens.
Cutbacks in flights and in personnel also
were announced by Frontier Airlines, which

serves 16 states in the West and Midwest.
Frontier said it was cutting effective Dec. 8
about 750 of its 4138 flights per week and
laying off 150 employees because of the fuel
shortage. It said further flight reductions
would have to be made early next year unless
the shortage lessens. By a flight or departure,
an airline is referring to each airport stop.
The cutbacks announced by United
yesterday were drafted before President
Nixon announced new fuel allocations for the
nation's airlines.
Year-Round Daylight Savings
WASHINGTON — The House yesterdry
voted to put the nation on year-round
daylight saving time.
The bill approved by a vote of 311 to 88 is
one of several pieces of legislation President
Nixon has said he needs to deal with the
energy crisis.
Year-round daylight saving time could
reduce electricity and heating demands by as
much as three percent, according to the White
House.
However, members were cautious about
predicting the potential fuel savings involved.
"I would say there is a high probability of
savings, based on the testimony of experts in
this field," commented Rep. James T.
Broyhili, R-N.C., the Republican floor
manager of the bill.
There was reluctant support for the bill
from farm belt congressmen, who
traditionally oppose daylight saving. "There is
no positive information that it will save
anything, only disrupt people's lives," argued
H.R. Gross, R-lowa, who voted against the
bill.
A similar measure set the nation's clocks
ahead by one hour during both winter and
summer months is expected to gain Senate
approval later this week.
The House-passed measure would establish
year-round daylight saving on a two-year trial
basis beginning on the first Sunday 15 days

after the bill's enactment and lasting through
October of 1975.
The bill directs the Department of
Transportation to make a study of the
legislation to determine whether it should be
extended after that.
Supporters of the measure argued that
shifting an hour of daylight from morning to
night would also be a boon to homeward
bound commuters, possibly reducing traffic
accidents and cutting crime.
Richardson Resignation
WASHINGTON - Elliot L. Richardson
said last night that he threatened to resign
twice as attorney general before actually
doing so, and that he suggested back in
August that President Nixon submit to
detailed questioning about Watergate.
"On two different occasions before Mr.
Cox's firing I made it clear that if he were
fired I would be forced to resign," Richardson
said. He resigned from the Cabinet Oct. 20
after the President fired Archibald Cox as
special Watergate prosecutor.
Richardson said he proposed to the White
House in August that Nixon undergo
questioning by persons familiar with the
Watergate scandal — specifically Cox and
Sens. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Howard H.
Baker Jr., R-Tenn., the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Senate Watergate
committee. He said he suggested a neutral
moderator — perhaps Sen. John C. Stennis,
D-Miss.
Richardson made the comments on the
Dick Cavett television show taped in
Washington about three hours before its airing
over the ABC network.
In reply to questions after the program, he
told newsmen he never made the suggestion to
Nixon directly, but rather to Gen. Alexander
M. Haig Jr., White House chief of staff,
counsel J. Fred Buzhardt and Presidential aide
Melvin R. Laird.
Was the idea relayed to the President?
"I was told that it had been," Richardson
replied. "I was told that the President was
working along those lines and that the
suggestion was appreciated."
Oil Restrictions Lifted
ALGIERS — Arab foreign ministers
approved a Saudi Arabia proposal that oil
restrictions against Japan and all European
Common Market countries except the
Netherlands be lifted, reliable sources
reported here yesterday.
The sources said the foreign ministers
approved the proposal at a meeting in Algiers
before a summit conference of Arab leaders
convened on Monday.
The summit conference is to act on the
ministers' resolutions.

The proposal by Saudi Arabia, the
Mideast's largest oil producer, apparently did
not include any change in the Arab embargo
of oil for the United States. The Netherlands
also is under a total embargo.
The Saudi proposal seeks to reward Europe
and Japan for recent declarations indicating a
tilt in policy more favorable to the Arabs, the
sources said.
The Netherlands was not included in the
proposed shift because the Arabs consider the
Dutch government to be committed to Israel,
the sources said.
US Reports Trade Surplus
WASHINGTON - The United States
reported another half-billion-dollar surplus in
its foreign trade in October, putting the
country closer to its first annual trade surplus
since 1970.
The October surplus was $527 million and
placed the trade surplus for the first 10
months of the year at $680 million. At the
same time a year ago, there was a trade deficit
of $5.2 billion.
The big improvement in the country's
foreign trade is attributed by economists to
the effect of two devaluations of the dollar,
which have made U.S. goods cheaper overseas
and foreign goods more expensive at home.
Student Files Suit
DETROIT — A suit on behalf of a
University of Michigan student seeking to
overturn the Big Ten's decision to send the
Ohio State football team to the Rose Bowl
was filed in U.S. District court yesterday.
The suit also seeks to have the procedure
the Big Ten used in choosing Ohio State
declared invalid because it violated due
process of law, and asks the court to bar Big
Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke from
participating in the decision-making process.
It also asks the court to order Big Ten
athletic directors to meet publicly to decide
which team should play in the Rose Bowl.
U.S. District Court Judge Fred W. Kaess set
a hearing for Dec. 6.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy this morning. Rain likely
beginning this afternoon or evening and
continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Continued mild temperature. Low both nights
upper 40s to mid 50s. High today and
tomorrow mid 50s to mid 60s. Light
southerly wind increasing to 15 to 30 mph

WASHINGTON — One of the famed White
House tapes was played in public for the first
time yesterday but the only question it settled
is that there is indeed a humdinger of a hum.
It lasted, as the White House said, 18
minutes and 15 seconds.
To straining ears in U.S. District Judge
John J. Sirica's crowded courtroom, it
sounded like electric clippers in a barber shop,
Here and there, before and after the hum, the
voices of President Nixon and aides John D.
Ehriichman and H.R. Haldeman could be
heard in snatches of conversation.
"What the hell does that show you?" a
voice like the President's said once. "I'd like a
little of that consomme today." The President
again.
There was some whistling — tune and
whistler unidentified.
Then the long buzz, loud at first, then a
little lower and then loud again.
The tape, of a meeting in Nixon's
Executive Office building suite on June 20,
1972 — involving first Ehriichman and then
Haldeman — was played as the President's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was on the
stand.
Woods testified she was listening on
the June 20 tape for signs of Ehriichman
leaving Nixon's office — and that the
Haldeman conversation had already started —
when her telephone rang. As she reached for
the phone — to the left and behind her — she
said she accidentally pushed the record
button. At the same time, she said, her foot
must have been on the foot switch that starts
the tape machine.
After the telephone conversation, she said,
she noticed the record button down, listened
to the tape and discovered the hum. Then, she
said, she told the President who said not to
worry because only the Ehriichman
conversation tape was under subpoena. This
was an erroneous impression according to
prosecutors.
On Nov. 14, as the National Security
Agency was making copies of that tape for the
judge, the 18-minute gap was discovered. Miss
Woods said the President told her of the
length of obliterated conversation.
"I couldn't believe there could be
something like that unless there was a
malfunction in the tape," the red-haired

Woods said.
That left at least 13 minutes of obliterated
conversation unexplained. Experts will assist
Sirica in determining the cause.
Rationing Seen Possible
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration's Cabinet-level energy group is
leaning strongly toward gasoline rationing,
informed sources said after the panel met
yesterday.
Government sources said the
administration, which announced Sunday
night its intention to cut gasoline supplies 15
percent, wants to double that reduction over
the next few months.
The "Emergency Energy Action Group,"
trying to figure out ways to achieve that
reduction, has been considering complete
gasoline rationing, or a 30-to-40-cent gasoline
tax, a combination of both, or maybe the
removal of gasoline price controls.
A source said even Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz, who has favored a gasoline
tax over rationing, appeared to waver in
yesterday's meeting.
The source said no decisions have been
made but there was no enthusiasm for
removing price controls. It was thought that
oil companies could reap windfall profits from
this strategy while gasoline is short and could
' work hardships on consumers who must have
gasoline for essential purposes, the source
said.
The gasoline tax had more support, but the
source said the Cabinet group was
approaching the conclusion that it could not
be adopted fast enough.
Meantime, other sources said the Interior
Secretary Rogers C.3. Morton was on the
verge of leasing federal western lands for
experimental development of oil shale, a
potential source of vast new oil supplies.
United Caneels Flights
WASHINGTON - United Air Lines
announced yesterday it is laying off at least
950 employees beginning Jan. 7 and will
cancel 100 flights in January because of the
fuel shortage.
The company said some of the employees
were notified yesterday that they would be
laid off.
Even more flights will be eliminated in the
next two months, said United President
Edward E. Carlson. But he added he would do
everything possible to keep from laying off
more workers.
Carlson said United, the nation's largest air
carrier, might reduce work hours — and the
pay — of employees rather than furlough
more workers if the shortage worsens.
Cutbacks in flights and in personnel also
were announced by Frontier Airlines, which

serves 16 states in the West and Midwest.
Frontier said it was cutting effective Dec. 8
about 750 of its 4138 flights per week and
laying off 150 employees because of the fuel
shortage. It said further flight reductions
would have to be made early next year unless
the shortage lessens. By a flight or departure,
an airline is referring to each airport stop.
The cutbacks announced by United
yesterday were drafted before President
Nixon announced new fuel allocations for the
nation's airlines.
Year-Round Daylight Savings
WASHINGTON — The House yesterdry
voted to put the nation on year-round
daylight saving time.
The bill approved by a vote of 311 to 88 is
one of several pieces of legislation President
Nixon has said he needs to deal with the
energy crisis.
Year-round daylight saving time could
reduce electricity and heating demands by as
much as three percent, according to the White
House.
However, members were cautious about
predicting the potential fuel savings involved.
"I would say there is a high probability of
savings, based on the testimony of experts in
this field," commented Rep. James T.
Broyhili, R-N.C., the Republican floor
manager of the bill.
There was reluctant support for the bill
from farm belt congressmen, who
traditionally oppose daylight saving. "There is
no positive information that it will save
anything, only disrupt people's lives," argued
H.R. Gross, R-lowa, who voted against the
bill.
A similar measure set the nation's clocks
ahead by one hour during both winter and
summer months is expected to gain Senate
approval later this week.
The House-passed measure would establish
year-round daylight saving on a two-year trial
basis beginning on the first Sunday 15 days

after the bill's enactment and lasting through
October of 1975.
The bill directs the Department of
Transportation to make a study of the
legislation to determine whether it should be
extended after that.
Supporters of the measure argued that
shifting an hour of daylight from morning to
night would also be a boon to homeward
bound commuters, possibly reducing traffic
accidents and cutting crime.
Richardson Resignation
WASHINGTON - Elliot L. Richardson
said last night that he threatened to resign
twice as attorney general before actually
doing so, and that he suggested back in
August that President Nixon submit to
detailed questioning about Watergate.
"On two different occasions before Mr.
Cox's firing I made it clear that if he were
fired I would be forced to resign," Richardson
said. He resigned from the Cabinet Oct. 20
after the President fired Archibald Cox as
special Watergate prosecutor.
Richardson said he proposed to the White
House in August that Nixon undergo
questioning by persons familiar with the
Watergate scandal — specifically Cox and
Sens. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Howard H.
Baker Jr., R-Tenn., the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Senate Watergate
committee. He said he suggested a neutral
moderator — perhaps Sen. John C. Stennis,
D-Miss.
Richardson made the comments on the
Dick Cavett television show taped in
Washington about three hours before its airing
over the ABC network.
In reply to questions after the program, he
told newsmen he never made the suggestion to
Nixon directly, but rather to Gen. Alexander
M. Haig Jr., White House chief of staff,
counsel J. Fred Buzhardt and Presidential aide
Melvin R. Laird.
Was the idea relayed to the President?
"I was told that it had been," Richardson
replied. "I was told that the President was
working along those lines and that the
suggestion was appreciated."
Oil Restrictions Lifted
ALGIERS — Arab foreign ministers
approved a Saudi Arabia proposal that oil
restrictions against Japan and all European
Common Market countries except the
Netherlands be lifted, reliable sources
reported here yesterday.
The sources said the foreign ministers
approved the proposal at a meeting in Algiers
before a summit conference of Arab leaders
convened on Monday.
The summit conference is to act on the
ministers' resolutions.

The proposal by Saudi Arabia, the
Mideast's largest oil producer, apparently did
not include any change in the Arab embargo
of oil for the United States. The Netherlands
also is under a total embargo.
The Saudi proposal seeks to reward Europe
and Japan for recent declarations indicating a
tilt in policy more favorable to the Arabs, the
sources said.
The Netherlands was not included in the
proposed shift because the Arabs consider the
Dutch government to be committed to Israel,
the sources said.
US Reports Trade Surplus
WASHINGTON - The United States
reported another half-billion-dollar surplus in
its foreign trade in October, putting the
country closer to its first annual trade surplus
since 1970.
The October surplus was $527 million and
placed the trade surplus for the first 10
months of the year at $680 million. At the
same time a year ago, there was a trade deficit
of $5.2 billion.
The big improvement in the country's
foreign trade is attributed by economists to
the effect of two devaluations of the dollar,
which have made U.S. goods cheaper overseas
and foreign goods more expensive at home.
Student Files Suit
DETROIT — A suit on behalf of a
University of Michigan student seeking to
overturn the Big Ten's decision to send the
Ohio State football team to the Rose Bowl
was filed in U.S. District court yesterday.
The suit also seeks to have the procedure
the Big Ten used in choosing Ohio State
declared invalid because it violated due
process of law, and asks the court to bar Big
Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke from
participating in the decision-making process.
It also asks the court to order Big Ten
athletic directors to meet publicly to decide
which team should play in the Rose Bowl.
U.S. District Court Judge Fred W. Kaess set
a hearing for Dec. 6.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy this morning. Rain likely
beginning this afternoon or evening and
continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Continued mild temperature. Low both nights
upper 40s to mid 50s. High today and

House tapes was played in public for the first
time yesterday but the only question it settled
is that there is indeed a humdinger of a hum.
It lasted, as the White House said, 18
minutes and 15 seconds.
To straining ears in U.S. District Judge
John J. Sirica's crowded courtroom, it
sounded like electric clippers in a barber shop,
Here and there, before and after the hum, the
voices of President Nixon and aides John D.
Ehriichman and H.R. Haldeman could be
heard in snatches of conversation.
"What the hell does that show you?" a
voice like the President's said once. "I'd like a
little of that consomme today." The President
again.
There was some whistling — tune and
whistler unidentified.
Then the long buzz, loud at first, then a
little lower and then loud again.
The tape, of a meeting in Nixon's
Executive Office building suite on June 20,
1972 — involving first Ehriichman and then
Haldeman — was played as the President's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was on the
stand.
Woods testified she was listening on
the June 20 tape for signs of Ehriichman
leaving Nixon's office — and that the
Haldeman conversation had already started —
when her telephone rang. As she reached for
the phone — to the left and behind her — she
said she accidentally pushed the record
button. At the same time, she said, her foot
must have been on the foot switch that starts
the tape machine.
After the telephone conversation, she said,
she noticed the record button down, listened
to the tape and discovered the hum. Then, she
said, she told the President who said not to
worry because only the Ehriichman
conversation tape was under subpoena. This
was an erroneous impression according to
prosecutors.
On Nov. 14, as the National Security
Agency was making copies of that tape for the
judge, the 18-minute gap was discovered. Miss
Woods said the President told her of the
length of obliterated conversation.
"I couldn't believe there could be
something like that unless there was a
malfunction in the tape," the red-haired

Woods said.
That left at least 13 minutes of obliterated
conversation unexplained. Experts will assist
Sirica in determining the cause.
Rationing Seen Possible
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration's Cabinet-level energy group is
leaning strongly toward gasoline rationing,
informed sources said after the panel met
yesterday.
Government sources said the
administration, which announced Sunday
night its intention to cut gasoline supplies 15
percent, wants to double that reduction over
the next few months.
The "Emergency Energy Action Group,"
trying to figure out ways to achieve that
reduction, has been considering complete
gasoline rationing, or a 30-to-40-cent gasoline
tax, a combination of both, or maybe the
removal of gasoline price controls.
A source said even Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz, who has favored a gasoline
tax over rationing, appeared to waver in
yesterday's meeting.
The source said no decisions have been
made but there was no enthusiasm for
removing price controls. It was thought that
oil companies could reap windfall profits from
this strategy while gasoline is short and could
' work hardships on consumers who must have
gasoline for essential purposes, the source
said.
The gasoline tax had more support, but the
source said the Cabinet group was
approaching the conclusion that it could not
be adopted fast enough.
Meantime, other sources said the Interior
Secretary Rogers C.3. Morton was on the
verge of leasing federal western lands for
experimental development of oil shale, a
potential source of vast new oil supplies.
United Caneels Flights
WASHINGTON - United Air Lines
announced yesterday it is laying off at least
950 employees beginning Jan. 7 and will
cancel 100 flights in January because of the
fuel shortage.
The company said some of the employees
were notified yesterday that they would be
laid off.
Even more flights will be eliminated in the
next two months, said United President
Edward E. Carlson. But he added he would do
everything possible to keep from laying off
more workers.
Carlson said United, the nation's largest air
carrier, might reduce work hours — and the
pay — of employees rather than furlough
more workers if the shortage worsens.
Cutbacks in flights and in personnel also
were announced by Frontier Airlines, which

serves 16 states in the West and Midwest.
Frontier said it was cutting effective Dec. 8
about 750 of its 4138 flights per week and
laying off 150 employees because of the fuel
shortage. It said further flight reductions
would have to be made early next year unless
the shortage lessens. By a flight or departure,
an airline is referring to each airport stop.
The cutbacks announced by United
yesterday were drafted before President
Nixon announced new fuel allocations for the
nation's airlines.
Year-Round Daylight Savings
WASHINGTON — The House yesterdry
voted to put the nation on year-round
daylight saving time.
The bill approved by a vote of 311 to 88 is
one of several pieces of legislation President
Nixon has said he needs to deal with the
energy crisis.
Year-round daylight saving time could
reduce electricity and heating demands by as
much as three percent, according to the White
House.
However, members were cautious about
predicting the potential fuel savings involved.
"I would say there is a high probability of
savings, based on the testimony of experts in
this field," commented Rep. James T.
Broyhili, R-N.C., the Republican floor
manager of the bill.
There was reluctant support for the bill
from farm belt congressmen, who
traditionally oppose daylight saving. "There is
no positive information that it will save
anything, only disrupt people's lives," argued
H.R. Gross, R-lowa, who voted against the
bill.
A similar measure set the nation's clocks
ahead by one hour during both winter and
summer months is expected to gain Senate
approval later this week.
The House-passed measure would establish
year-round daylight saving on a two-year trial
basis beginning on the first Sunday 15 days

after the bill's enactment and lasting through
October of 1975.
The bill directs the Department of
Transportation to make a study of the
legislation to determine whether it should be
extended after that.
Supporters of the measure argued that
shifting an hour of daylight from morning to
night would also be a boon to homeward
bound commuters, possibly reducing traffic
accidents and cutting crime.
Richardson Resignation
WASHINGTON - Elliot L. Richardson
said last night that he threatened to resign
twice as attorney general before actually
doing so, and that he suggested back in
August that President Nixon submit to
detailed questioning about Watergate.
"On two different occasions before Mr.
Cox's firing I made it clear that if he were
fired I would be forced to resign," Richardson
said. He resigned from the Cabinet Oct. 20
after the President fired Archibald Cox as
special Watergate prosecutor.
Richardson said he proposed to the White
House in August that Nixon undergo
questioning by persons familiar with the
Watergate scandal — specifically Cox and
Sens. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Howard H.
Baker Jr., R-Tenn., the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Senate Watergate
committee. He said he suggested a neutral
moderator — perhaps Sen. John C. Stennis,
D-Miss.
Richardson made the comments on the
Dick Cavett television show taped in
Washington about three hours before its airing
over the ABC network.
In reply to questions after the program, he
told newsmen he never made the suggestion to
Nixon directly, but rather to Gen. Alexander
M. Haig Jr., White House chief of staff,
counsel J. Fred Buzhardt and Presidential aide
Melvin R. Laird.
Was the idea relayed to the President?
"I was told that it had been," Richardson
replied. "I was told that the President was
working along those lines and that the
suggestion was appreciated."
Oil Restrictions Lifted
ALGIERS — Arab foreign ministers
approved a Saudi Arabia proposal that oil
restrictions against Japan and all European
Common Market countries except the
Netherlands be lifted, reliable sources
reported here yesterday.
The sources said the foreign ministers
approved the proposal at a meeting in Algiers
before a summit conference of Arab leaders
convened on Monday.
The summit conference is to act on the
ministers' resolutions.

The proposal by Saudi Arabia, the
Mideast's largest oil producer, apparently did
not include any change in the Arab embargo
of oil for the United States. The Netherlands
also is under a total embargo.
The Saudi proposal seeks to reward Europe
and Japan for recent declarations indicating a
tilt in policy more favorable to the Arabs, the
sources said.
The Netherlands was not included in the
proposed shift because the Arabs consider the
Dutch government to be committed to Israel,
the sources said.
US Reports Trade Surplus
WASHINGTON - The United States
reported another half-billion-dollar surplus in
its foreign trade in October, putting the
country closer to its first annual trade surplus
since 1970.
The October surplus was $527 million and
placed the trade surplus for the first 10
months of the year at $680 million. At the
same time a year ago, there was a trade deficit
of $5.2 billion.
The big improvement in the country's
foreign trade is attributed by economists to
the effect of two devaluations of the dollar,
which have made U.S. goods cheaper overseas
and foreign goods more expensive at home.
Student Files Suit
DETROIT — A suit on behalf of a
University of Michigan student seeking to
overturn the Big Ten's decision to send the
Ohio State football team to the Rose Bowl
was filed in U.S. District court yesterday.
The suit also seeks to have the procedure
the Big Ten used in choosing Ohio State
declared invalid because it violated due
process of law, and asks the court to bar Big
Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke from
participating in the decision-making process.
It also asks the court to order Big Ten
athletic directors to meet publicly to decide
which team should play in the Rose Bowl.
U.S. District Court Judge Fred W. Kaess set
a hearing for Dec. 6.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy this morning. Rain likely
beginning this afternoon or evening and
continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Continued mild temperature. Low both nights
upper 40s to mid 50s. High today and
tomorrow mid 50s to mid 60s. Light

time yesterday but the only question it settled
is that there is indeed a humdinger of a hum.
It lasted, as the White House said, 18
minutes and 15 seconds.
To straining ears in U.S. District Judge
John J. Sirica's crowded courtroom, it
sounded like electric clippers in a barber shop,
Here and there, before and after the hum, the
voices of President Nixon and aides John D.
Ehriichman and H.R. Haldeman could be
heard in snatches of conversation.
"What the hell does that show you?" a
voice like the President's said once. "I'd like a
little of that consomme today." The President
again.
There was some whistling — tune and
whistler unidentified.
Then the long buzz, loud at first, then a
little lower and then loud again.
The tape, of a meeting in Nixon's
Executive Office building suite on June 20,
1972 — involving first Ehriichman and then
Haldeman — was played as the President's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was on the
stand.
Woods testified she was listening on
the June 20 tape for signs of Ehriichman
leaving Nixon's office — and that the
Haldeman conversation had already started —
when her telephone rang. As she reached for
the phone — to the left and behind her — she
said she accidentally pushed the record
button. At the same time, she said, her foot
must have been on the foot switch that starts
the tape machine.
After the telephone conversation, she said,
she noticed the record button down, listened
to the tape and discovered the hum. Then, she
said, she told the President who said not to
worry because only the Ehriichman
conversation tape was under subpoena. This
was an erroneous impression according to
prosecutors.
On Nov. 14, as the National Security
Agency was making copies of that tape for the
judge, the 18-minute gap was discovered. Miss
Woods said the President told her of the
length of obliterated conversation.
"I couldn't believe there could be
something like that unless there was a
malfunction in the tape," the red-haired

Woods said.
That left at least 13 minutes of obliterated
conversation unexplained. Experts will assist
Sirica in determining the cause.
Rationing Seen Possible
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration's Cabinet-level energy group is
leaning strongly toward gasoline rationing,
informed sources said after the panel met
yesterday.
Government sources said the
administration, which announced Sunday
night its intention to cut gasoline supplies 15
percent, wants to double that reduction over
the next few months.
The "Emergency Energy Action Group,"
trying to figure out ways to achieve that
reduction, has been considering complete
gasoline rationing, or a 30-to-40-cent gasoline
tax, a combination of both, or maybe the
removal of gasoline price controls.
A source said even Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz, who has favored a gasoline
tax over rationing, appeared to waver in
yesterday's meeting.
The source said no decisions have been
made but there was no enthusiasm for
removing price controls. It was thought that
oil companies could reap windfall profits from
this strategy while gasoline is short and could
' work hardships on consumers who must have
gasoline for essential purposes, the source
said.
The gasoline tax had more support, but the
source said the Cabinet group was
approaching the conclusion that it could not
be adopted fast enough.
Meantime, other sources said the Interior
Secretary Rogers C.3. Morton was on the
verge of leasing federal western lands for
experimental development of oil shale, a
potential source of vast new oil supplies.
United Caneels Flights
WASHINGTON - United Air Lines
announced yesterday it is laying off at least
950 employees beginning Jan. 7 and will
cancel 100 flights in January because of the
fuel shortage.
The company said some of the employees
were notified yesterday that they would be
laid off.
Even more flights will be eliminated in the
next two months, said United President
Edward E. Carlson. But he added he would do
everything possible to keep from laying off
more workers.
Carlson said United, the nation's largest air
carrier, might reduce work hours — and the
pay — of employees rather than furlough
more workers if the shortage worsens.
Cutbacks in flights and in personnel also
were announced by Frontier Airlines, which

serves 16 states in the West and Midwest.
Frontier said it was cutting effective Dec. 8
about 750 of its 4138 flights per week and
laying off 150 employees because of the fuel
shortage. It said further flight reductions
would have to be made early next year unless
the shortage lessens. By a flight or departure,
an airline is referring to each airport stop.
The cutbacks announced by United
yesterday were drafted before President
Nixon announced new fuel allocations for the
nation's airlines.
Year-Round Daylight Savings
WASHINGTON — The House yesterdry
voted to put the nation on year-round
daylight saving time.
The bill approved by a vote of 311 to 88 is
one of several pieces of legislation President
Nixon has said he needs to deal with the
energy crisis.
Year-round daylight saving time could
reduce electricity and heating demands by as
much as three percent, according to the White
House.
However, members were cautious about
predicting the potential fuel savings involved.
"I would say there is a high probability of
savings, based on the testimony of experts in
this field," commented Rep. James T.
Broyhili, R-N.C., the Republican floor
manager of the bill.
There was reluctant support for the bill
from farm belt congressmen, who
traditionally oppose daylight saving. "There is
no positive information that it will save
anything, only disrupt people's lives," argued
H.R. Gross, R-lowa, who voted against the
bill.
A similar measure set the nation's clocks
ahead by one hour during both winter and
summer months is expected to gain Senate
approval later this week.
The House-passed measure would establish
year-round daylight saving on a two-year trial
basis beginning on the first Sunday 15 days

after the bill's enactment and lasting through
October of 1975.
The bill directs the Department of
Transportation to make a study of the
legislation to determine whether it should be
extended after that.
Supporters of the measure argued that
shifting an hour of daylight from morning to
night would also be a boon to homeward
bound commuters, possibly reducing traffic
accidents and cutting crime.
Richardson Resignation
WASHINGTON - Elliot L. Richardson
said last night that he threatened to resign
twice as attorney general before actually
doing so, and that he suggested back in
August that President Nixon submit to
detailed questioning about Watergate.
"On two different occasions before Mr.
Cox's firing I made it clear that if he were
fired I would be forced to resign," Richardson
said. He resigned from the Cabinet Oct. 20
after the President fired Archibald Cox as
special Watergate prosecutor.
Richardson said he proposed to the White
House in August that Nixon undergo
questioning by persons familiar with the
Watergate scandal — specifically Cox and
Sens. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Howard H.
Baker Jr., R-Tenn., the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Senate Watergate
committee. He said he suggested a neutral
moderator — perhaps Sen. John C. Stennis,
D-Miss.
Richardson made the comments on the
Dick Cavett television show taped in
Washington about three hours before its airing
over the ABC network.
In reply to questions after the program, he
told newsmen he never made the suggestion to
Nixon directly, but rather to Gen. Alexander
M. Haig Jr., White House chief of staff,
counsel J. Fred Buzhardt and Presidential aide
Melvin R. Laird.
Was the idea relayed to the President?
"I was told that it had been," Richardson
replied. "I was told that the President was
working along those lines and that the
suggestion was appreciated."
Oil Restrictions Lifted
ALGIERS — Arab foreign ministers
approved a Saudi Arabia proposal that oil
restrictions against Japan and all European
Common Market countries except the
Netherlands be lifted, reliable sources
reported here yesterday.
The sources said the foreign ministers
approved the proposal at a meeting in Algiers
before a summit conference of Arab leaders
convened on Monday.
The summit conference is to act on the
ministers' resolutions.

The proposal by Saudi Arabia, the
Mideast's largest oil producer, apparently did
not include any change in the Arab embargo
of oil for the United States. The Netherlands
also is under a total embargo.
The Saudi proposal seeks to reward Europe
and Japan for recent declarations indicating a
tilt in policy more favorable to the Arabs, the
sources said.
The Netherlands was not included in the
proposed shift because the Arabs consider the
Dutch government to be committed to Israel,
the sources said.
US Reports Trade Surplus
WASHINGTON - The United States
reported another half-billion-dollar surplus in
its foreign trade in October, putting the
country closer to its first annual trade surplus
since 1970.
The October surplus was $527 million and
placed the trade surplus for the first 10
months of the year at $680 million. At the
same time a year ago, there was a trade deficit
of $5.2 billion.
The big improvement in the country's
foreign trade is attributed by economists to
the effect of two devaluations of the dollar,
which have made U.S. goods cheaper overseas
and foreign goods more expensive at home.
Student Files Suit
DETROIT — A suit on behalf of a
University of Michigan student seeking to
overturn the Big Ten's decision to send the
Ohio State football team to the Rose Bowl
was filed in U.S. District court yesterday.
The suit also seeks to have the procedure
the Big Ten used in choosing Ohio State
declared invalid because it violated due
process of law, and asks the court to bar Big
Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke from
participating in the decision-making process.
It also asks the court to order Big Ten
athletic directors to meet publicly to decide
which team should play in the Rose Bowl.
U.S. District Court Judge Fred W. Kaess set
a hearing for Dec. 6.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy this morning. Rain likely
beginning this afternoon or evening and
continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Continued mild temperature. Low both nights
upper 40s to mid 50s. High today and

is that there is indeed a humdinger of a hum.
It lasted, as the White House said, 18
minutes and 15 seconds.
To straining ears in U.S. District Judge
John J. Sirica's crowded courtroom, it
sounded like electric clippers in a barber shop,
Here and there, before and after the hum, the
voices of President Nixon and aides John D.
Ehriichman and H.R. Haldeman could be
heard in snatches of conversation.
"What the hell does that show you?" a
voice like the President's said once. "I'd like a
little of that consomme today." The President
again.
There was some whistling — tune and
whistler unidentified.
Then the long buzz, loud at first, then a
little lower and then loud again.
The tape, of a meeting in Nixon's
Executive Office building suite on June 20,
1972 — involving first Ehriichman and then
Haldeman — was played as the President's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was on the
stand.
Woods testified she was listening on
the June 20 tape for signs of Ehriichman
leaving Nixon's office — and that the
Haldeman conversation had already started —
when her telephone rang. As she reached for
the phone — to the left and behind her — she
said she accidentally pushed the record
button. At the same time, she said, her foot
must have been on the foot switch that starts
the tape machine.
After the telephone conversation, she said,
she noticed the record button down, listened
to the tape and discovered the hum. Then, she
said, she told the President who said not to
worry because only the Ehriichman
conversation tape was under subpoena. This
was an erroneous impression according to
prosecutors.
On Nov. 14, as the National Security
Agency was making copies of that tape for the
judge, the 18-minute gap was discovered. Miss
Woods said the President told her of the
length of obliterated conversation.
"I couldn't believe there could be
something like that unless there was a
malfunction in the tape," the red-haired

Woods said.
That left at least 13 minutes of obliterated
conversation unexplained. Experts will assist
Sirica in determining the cause.
Rationing Seen Possible
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration's Cabinet-level energy group is
leaning strongly toward gasoline rationing,
informed sources said after the panel met
yesterday.
Government sources said the
administration, which announced Sunday
night its intention to cut gasoline supplies 15
percent, wants to double that reduction over
the next few months.
The "Emergency Energy Action Group,"
trying to figure out ways to achieve that
reduction, has been considering complete
gasoline rationing, or a 30-to-40-cent gasoline
tax, a combination of both, or maybe the
removal of gasoline price controls.
A source said even Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz, who has favored a gasoline
tax over rationing, appeared to waver in
yesterday's meeting.
The source said no decisions have been
made but there was no enthusiasm for
removing price controls. It was thought that
oil companies could reap windfall profits from
this strategy while gasoline is short and could
' work hardships on consumers who must have
gasoline for essential purposes, the source
said.
The gasoline tax had more support, but the
source said the Cabinet group was
approaching the conclusion that it could not
be adopted fast enough.
Meantime, other sources said the Interior
Secretary Rogers C.3. Morton was on the
verge of leasing federal western lands for
experimental development of oil shale, a
potential source of vast new oil supplies.
United Caneels Flights
WASHINGTON - United Air Lines
announced yesterday it is laying off at least
950 employees beginning Jan. 7 and will
cancel 100 flights in January because of the
fuel shortage.
The company said some of the employees
were notified yesterday that they would be
laid off.
Even more flights will be eliminated in the
next two months, said United President
Edward E. Carlson. But he added he would do
everything possible to keep from laying off
more workers.
Carlson said United, the nation's largest air
carrier, might reduce work hours — and the
pay — of employees rather than furlough
more workers if the shortage worsens.
Cutbacks in flights and in personnel also
were announced by Frontier Airlines, which

serves 16 states in the West and Midwest.
Frontier said it was cutting effective Dec. 8
about 750 of its 4138 flights per week and
laying off 150 employees because of the fuel
shortage. It said further flight reductions
would have to be made early next year unless
the shortage lessens. By a flight or departure,
an airline is referring to each airport stop.
The cutbacks announced by United
yesterday were drafted before President
Nixon announced new fuel allocations for the
nation's airlines.
Year-Round Daylight Savings
WASHINGTON — The House yesterdry
voted to put the nation on year-round
daylight saving time.
The bill approved by a vote of 311 to 88 is
one of several pieces of legislation President
Nixon has said he needs to deal with the
energy crisis.
Year-round daylight saving time could
reduce electricity and heating demands by as
much as three percent, according to the White
House.
However, members were cautious about
predicting the potential fuel savings involved.
"I would say there is a high probability of
savings, based on the testimony of experts in
this field," commented Rep. James T.
Broyhili, R-N.C., the Republican floor
manager of the bill.
There was reluctant support for the bill
from farm belt congressmen, who
traditionally oppose daylight saving. "There is
no positive information that it will save
anything, only disrupt people's lives," argued
H.R. Gross, R-lowa, who voted against the
bill.
A similar measure set the nation's clocks
ahead by one hour during both winter and
summer months is expected to gain Senate
approval later this week.
The House-passed measure would establish
year-round daylight saving on a two-year trial
basis beginning on the first Sunday 15 days

after the bill's enactment and lasting through
October of 1975.
The bill directs the Department of
Transportation to make a study of the
legislation to determine whether it should be
extended after that.
Supporters of the measure argued that
shifting an hour of daylight from morning to
night would also be a boon to homeward
bound commuters, possibly reducing traffic
accidents and cutting crime.
Richardson Resignation
WASHINGTON - Elliot L. Richardson
said last night that he threatened to resign
twice as attorney general before actually
doing so, and that he suggested back in
August that President Nixon submit to
detailed questioning about Watergate.
"On two different occasions before Mr.
Cox's firing I made it clear that if he were
fired I would be forced to resign," Richardson
said. He resigned from the Cabinet Oct. 20
after the President fired Archibald Cox as
special Watergate prosecutor.
Richardson said he proposed to the White
House in August that Nixon undergo
questioning by persons familiar with the
Watergate scandal — specifically Cox and
Sens. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and Howard H.
Baker Jr., R-Tenn., the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Senate Watergate
committee. He said he suggested a neutral
moderator — perhaps Sen. John C. Stennis,
D-Miss.
Richardson made the comments on the
Dick Cavett television show taped in
Washington about three hours before its airing
over the ABC network.
In reply to questions after the program, he
told newsmen he never made the suggestion to
Nixon directly, but rather to Gen. Alexander
M. Haig Jr., White House chief of staff,
counsel J. Fred Buzhardt and Presidential aide
Melvin R. Laird.
Was the idea relayed to the President?
"I was told that it had been," Richardson
replied. "I was told that the President was
working along those lines and that the
suggestion was appreciated."
Oil Restrictions Lifted
ALGIERS — Arab foreign ministers
approved a Saudi Arabia proposal that oil
restrictions against Japan and all European
Common Market countries except the
Netherlands be lifted, reliable sources
reported here yesterday.
The sources said the foreign ministers
approved the proposal at a meeting in Algiers
before a summit conference of Arab leaders
convened on Monday.
The summit conference is to act on the
ministers' resolutions.

The proposal by Saudi Arabia, the
Mideast's largest oil producer, apparently did
not include any change in the Arab embargo
of oil for the United States. The Netherlands
also is under a total embargo.
The Saudi proposal seeks to reward Europe
and Japan for recent declarations indicating a
tilt in policy more favorable to the Arabs, the
sources said.
The Netherlands was not included in the
proposed shift because the Arabs consider the
Dutch government to be committed to Israel,
the sources said.
US Reports Trade Surplus
WASHINGTON - The United States
reported another half-billion-dollar surplus in
its foreign trade in October, putting the
country closer to its first annual trade surplus
since 1970.
The October surplus was $527 million and
placed the trade surplus for the first 10
months of the year at $680 million. At the
same time a year ago, there was a trade deficit
of $5.2 billion.
The big improvement in the country's
foreign trade is attributed by economists to
the effect of two devaluations of the dollar,
which have made U.S. goods cheaper overseas
and foreign goods more expensive at home.
Student Files Suit
DETROIT — A suit on behalf of a
University of Michigan student seeking to
overturn the Big Ten's decision to send the
Ohio State football team to the Rose Bowl
was filed in U.S. District court yesterday.
The suit also seeks to have the procedure
the Big Ten used in choosing Ohio State
declared invalid because it violated due
process of law, and asks the court to bar Big
Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke from
participating in the decision-making process.
It also asks the court to order Big Ten
athletic directors to meet publicly to decide
which team should play in the Rose Bowl.
U.S. District Court Judge Fred W. Kaess set
a hearing for Dec. 6.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy this morning. Rain likely
beginning this afternoon or evening and
continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Continued mild temperature. Low both nights
upper 40s to mid 50s. High today and
tomorrow mid 50s to mid 60s. Light
southerly wind increasing to 15 to 30 mph
