# Another Power Failure
## 
### 
A power failure blacked out most
central campus buildings between 12:06
p.m. and 12:30 p.m. yesterday.
Plant Services Manager of Utilities Bob
McKnight surmised that the outage was
caused "by a hole in an underground
cable" which has yet to be discovered.
Power was restored by switching to an
alternate cable, he said.
Buildings affected included Wilbur,
Stern, Crothers, Toyon and Branner Halls,
Main Library, Cubberley, Memorial
Auditorium, the Business School, the Art
building, the Athletic Department and
Buildings One through 460 in the Quad.
