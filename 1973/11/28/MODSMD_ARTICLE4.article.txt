# Senate Approves Ford
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The Senate
overwhelmingly approved Rep. Gerald
R. Ford yesterday as the nation's 40th
vice president.
House approval, expected next
week, would complete congressional
confirmation as required by the 25th
Amendment, ratified in 1967.
The vote was 92 to 3 in favor of the
Michigan Republican. All the
opponents were Democrats.
Ford, who awaited the vote in the
office of Senate GOP Leader Hugh
Scott, called the margin "encouraging
and a vote that I'm just darned
grateful for."
The Senate vote had been
sch (duled just less than seven weeks
after Spiro T. Agnew resigned the
nation's second highest office and

pleaded no contest to a single count of
income tax evasion.
Two days later, Nixon, who had
twice selected Agnew as his running
mate, chose Ford, a 25-year House
veteran who has been House
Republican leader since 1965. In what
members said was probably the most
searching scrutiny of any presidential
nominee in history, Senate and House
committees sent hundreds of
investigators looking into Ford's
background and studied 2000 pages of
raw FBI files.
Ford spent six days before Senate
and House panels, answering detailed
questions about his financial dealings,
handling of campaign funds and
philosophy, winning congressional
praise for openness and candor.
Members of both the Senate and
House stressed that the proceedings
were especially important because of
the start of preliminary impeachment
proceedings in the House against
Nixon.
Ford, 60, was strongly pushed for
the nomination by his House
Republican colleagues. A number of
Democrats are likely to vote against
him, however, because of his
conservative voting record and some
allegations he is unsuited for the vice
presidency or presidency.
The only opposition to the
nominee in the Senate debate came
from Sen. William D. Hathaway,
D-Maine, who said he felt that
confirmation should be delayed "until

questions concerning the President are
resolved."
Hathaway said that he felt it would
be improper for a President under
threat of removal from office to be
allowed to choose his own successor.
Critics of the Ford nomination
continued to question him closely
during the final day of hearings by the
House Judiciary Committee.
Rep. John Conyers, Jr., D-Mich.,
expressed concern over what he
termed Ford's efforts to cripple civil
rights legislation, and he said he was
also deeply concerned over the
nominee's conservative associates,
including former Rep. William C.
Cramer, a Florida Republican who is
now a Washington lawyer.
Ford had won the endorsement of a
Democratic liberal, Sen. Alan Cranston
of California, in the opening day of
Senate debate on the nomination.
Cranston told the Senate that he
had questioned several hundred
persons — Democrats and Republicans,
business and labor leaders, elected
politicians and party functionaries —
in California in an effort to learn all he
could about the nominee.
Of all those he consulted, he said
only two Republicans and three
Democrats "spoke out strongly against
Ford and urged his rejection."
The House Judiciary Committee,
which wound up its hearings Monday,
is expected to vote on the nomination
tomorrow. Action by the full House is
scheduled before Dec. 6.

Democratic liberal, Sen. Alan Cranston
of California, in the opening day of
Senate debate on the nomination.
Cranston told the Senate that he
had questioned several hundred
persons — Democrats and Republicans,
business and labor leaders, elected
politicians and party functionaries —
in California in an effort to learn all he
could about the nominee.
Of all those he consulted, he said
only two Republicans and three
Democrats "spoke out strongly against
Ford and urged his rejection."
The House Judiciary Committee,
which wound up its hearings Monday,
is expected to vote on the nomination
tomorrow. Action by the full House is
scheduled before Dec. 6.

WASHINGTON - The Senate
overwhelmingly approved Rep. Gerald
R. Ford yesterday as the nation's 40th
vice president.
House approval, expected next
week, would complete congressional
confirmation as required by the 25th
Amendment, ratified in 1967.
The vote was 92 to 3 in favor of the
Michigan Republican. All the
opponents were Democrats.
Ford, who awaited the vote in the
office of Senate GOP Leader Hugh
Scott, called the margin "encouraging
and a vote that I'm just darned
grateful for."
The Senate vote had been
sch (duled just less than seven weeks
after Spiro T. Agnew resigned the
nation's second highest office and

pleaded no contest to a single count of
income tax evasion.
Two days later, Nixon, who had
twice selected Agnew as his running
mate, chose Ford, a 25-year House
veteran who has been House
Republican leader since 1965. In what
members said was probably the most
searching scrutiny of any presidential
nominee in history, Senate and House
committees sent hundreds of
investigators looking into Ford's
background and studied 2000 pages of
raw FBI files.
Ford spent six days before Senate
and House panels, answering detailed
questions about his financial dealings,
handling of campaign funds and
philosophy, winning congressional
praise for openness and candor.
Members of both the Senate and
House stressed that the proceedings
were especially important because of
the start of preliminary impeachment
proceedings in the House against
Nixon.
Ford, 60, was strongly pushed for
the nomination by his House
Republican colleagues. A number of
Democrats are likely to vote against
him, however, because of his
conservative voting record and some
allegations he is unsuited for the vice
presidency or presidency.
The only opposition to the
nominee in the Senate debate came
from Sen. William D. Hathaway,
D-Maine, who said he felt that
confirmation should be delayed "until

questions concerning the President are
resolved."
Hathaway said that he felt it would
be improper for a President under
threat of removal from office to be
allowed to choose his own successor.
Critics of the Ford nomination
continued to question him closely
during the final day of hearings by the
House Judiciary Committee.
Rep. John Conyers, Jr., D-Mich.,
expressed concern over what he
termed Ford's efforts to cripple civil
rights legislation, and he said he was
also deeply concerned over the
nominee's conservative associates,
including former Rep. William C.
Cramer, a Florida Republican who is
now a Washington lawyer.
Ford had won the endorsement of a
Democratic liberal, Sen. Alan Cranston
of California, in the opening day of
Senate debate on the nomination.
