# Publications Board May Have $8000 Surplus To Distribute

The ASSU Publications Board, an organization of
several student publications that administers the Storke
Student Publications Building, could have up to $8000 to
spend on new or struggling publications at the end of this
year.
Gordon Imrie, chairman of the Pub Board, said he is
contemplating possible action the Pub Board might take
to distribute the money.
"Right now, I'm considering a possible full-scale
advertising campaign to make the campus aware this
money is available for student publications, subject to
board approval and the by-laws," Imrie stated.
"Some of the ($8000) could be used against debts of
the Quad, I'm told by Dave Martin, the ASSU student
financial manager," Imrie reported. The Quad left
substantial debts when it became defunct a few years ago.
Imrie said he had no idea of the extent of the surplus
until informed by a Daily reporter who examined board
books. More than $3000 of the total is left over from a
one-year-old fee assessment, designed to provide funding
for publications that are new or need help. Only about
$8000 of the original $12,500 assessment went to such
publications, while another $1400 went for labor and fee
refunds.
Blotter Money
Another $5000 in revenue should come from the
blotters and from sales of the Stanford Money Book.
Around $300 was left over from previous years'
operations.
When expenses are subtracted from income, the Pub
Board should have $8400. Yet only $8000 will be
available at the end of the year. The Daily discovered the
discrepancy came from a $500 allocation to the Quad,
which only used $100 of the money allowed to it. Alan
Wachtel, last year's Pub Board chairman, explained why.
"The Quad hadn't published for a year. At that time,
they had plans to change from a yearbook to sort of a
photography book," Wachtel said. "Nobody knew if they
could do it or not. They wanted $500, but to show their

good faith, they said, 'You give us $100 now, just to get
started. If we show some progress, give us the remaining
money.' " The remainder was never given.
Imrie has taken some action to reduce Pub Board
expenses. By vote of the board, on Imrie's suggestion, a
telephone used by several smaller publications in the
Storke Building was recently removed. One board member
had termed the phone "useless," yet the board spent $500
hiring persons to answer the phone last year, plus an
additional amount to pay for the phone itself.
The Pub Board can now release $500 it had placed in a
savings account to pay for phone expenses this year.
Imrie's Discretion
Another $500 of Pub Board money is under Imrie's
discretion as to whether it should be spent. It was
originally meant as a fee to finance a feasibility study on a
campus-wide advertising agency. The person who made
the study, Chuck Peterson, concluded that the agency
might not be a good idea.
"He decided, 'No, we shouldn't go whole hog on the
thing,' " Imrie noted. As a result, Peterson refused the
$500 fee. Imrie says he will suggest that the board give a
"token" amount to Peterson.
Some money raised by the fee assessment, ostensibly
to aid new or struggling media, did find its way into the
hands of such organizations. Real News, the black
newspaper, received $1800, while Chicanismo, the
chicano newspaper, got $1200. The Women's Center
Newsletter was allocated $500, and the Stanford Review,
received $423.
But "establishment" organizations — including the
Quad, the Chaparral, and the Sequoia, by Imrie's
definition — received a total of $4160 by the Publications
Board out of a total $8083 spent.
New Publications
"The Pub Board [still] encourages people to come in
with ideas for new or struggling publications," Imrie
promised, despite "the apparent domination of the
Chappy, Quad, Daily, and Sequoia — the 'establishment'
organizations."
The Daily, while a board member, receives no financial
support from the board.
Member publications on the board include the
Chaparral, the Daily, the Quad, Sequoia, the Stanford
Review, Real News, the Blotter, the Money Book and

The ASSU Publications Board, an organization of
several student publications that administers the Storke
Student Publications Building, could have up to $8000 to
spend on new or struggling publications at the end of this
year.
Gordon Imrie, chairman of the Pub Board, said he is
contemplating possible action the Pub Board might take
to distribute the money.
"Right now, I'm considering a possible full-scale
advertising campaign to make the campus aware this
money is available for student publications, subject to
board approval and the by-laws," Imrie stated.
"Some of the ($8000) could be used against debts of
the Quad, I'm told by Dave Martin, the ASSU student
financial manager," Imrie reported. The Quad left
substantial debts when it became defunct a few years ago.
Imrie said he had no idea of the extent of the surplus
until informed by a Daily reporter who examined board
books. More than $3000 of the total is left over from a
one-year-old fee assessment, designed to provide funding
for publications that are new or need help. Only about
$8000 of the original $12,500 assessment went to such
publications, while another $1400 went for labor and fee
refunds.
Blotter Money
Another $5000 in revenue should come from the
blotters and from sales of the Stanford Money Book.
Around $300 was left over from previous years'
operations.
When expenses are subtracted from income, the Pub
Board should have $8400. Yet only $8000 will be
available at the end of the year. The Daily discovered the
discrepancy came from a $500 allocation to the Quad,
which only used $100 of the money allowed to it. Alan
Wachtel, last year's Pub Board chairman, explained why.
"The Quad hadn't published for a year. At that time,
they had plans to change from a yearbook to sort of a
photography book," Wachtel said. "Nobody knew if they
could do it or not. They wanted $500, but to show their

good faith, they said, 'You give us $100 now, just to get
started. If we show some progress, give us the remaining
money.' " The remainder was never given.
Imrie has taken some action to reduce Pub Board
expenses. By vote of the board, on Imrie's suggestion, a
telephone used by several smaller publications in the
Storke Building was recently removed. One board member
had termed the phone "useless," yet the board spent $500
hiring persons to answer the phone last year, plus an
additional amount to pay for the phone itself.
The Pub Board can now release $500 it had placed in a
savings account to pay for phone expenses this year.
Imrie's Discretion
Another $500 of Pub Board money is under Imrie's
discretion as to whether it should be spent. It was
originally meant as a fee to finance a feasibility study on a
campus-wide advertising agency. The person who made
the study, Chuck Peterson, concluded that the agency
might not be a good idea.
"He decided, 'No, we shouldn't go whole hog on the
thing,' " Imrie noted. As a result, Peterson refused the
$500 fee. Imrie says he will suggest that the board give a
"token" amount to Peterson.
Some money raised by the fee assessment, ostensibly
to aid new or struggling media, did find its way into the
hands of such organizations. Real News, the black
newspaper, received $1800, while Chicanismo, the
chicano newspaper, got $1200. The Women's Center
Newsletter was allocated $500, and the Stanford Review,
received $423.
But "establishment" organizations — including the
Quad, the Chaparral, and the Sequoia, by Imrie's
definition — received a total of $4160 by the Publications
Board out of a total $8083 spent.
New Publications
"The Pub Board [still] encourages people to come in
with ideas for new or struggling publications," Imrie
promised, despite "the apparent domination of the
Chappy, Quad, Daily, and Sequoia — the 'establishment'
organizations."
The Daily, while a board member, receives no financial
support from the board.
Member publications on the board include the
Chaparral, the Daily, the Quad, Sequoia, the Stanford
Review, Real News, the Blotter, the Money Book and
