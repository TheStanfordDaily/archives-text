## Housing Lockup 
### 
The energy crisis hit home last week as dormitory-dwellers
discovered their residences will be-closed during the Christmas break.
A great wail has gone up Irom the residents, and with good reason.
Energy crisis or no, tenants arc accustomed to better treatment — or
at least more advance warning — from their landlords.
Students who had planned to stay a lew days alter exams end on
Dec. I 5, or to return a few days before registration on Jan. 4, or even
to stay on campus lor the entire vacation, are suddenly recasting their
plans.
The tardiness of the announcement was .striking. So is the
persistent inability of University officials to estimate how many
students will be allowed to stay, what reasons for staying will be
deemed "legitimate, and which dorms will be open and which w ill be
closed.
Both of these striking things arouse suspicion that there is more
panic than planning in this end of the University 's energy policy
that a way to save fuel had to be found, that dormitory residents were
fixed on as the goats, and that nobody thought very far beyond that.
The rest of the process seems to be jury-rigged. The Housing Office
is accepting petitions to stay in the dorms until tomorrow. They have
no estimate of how many petitions are coming in, and so won't tell
residents whether they can stay, or where until "the middle of next
week —al the earliest. That catches students right in the middle of
dead week, a lousy time to disrupt anyone's life.
That isn t all. Housing officials won't decide what reasons lor
staying are "legitimate until they know how many people want to
stay. Students who want to stay, even for just a portion of the break,
have precious little advance idea of whether their applications will be
acceped.
Finally, the residents ol houses that will be used to shelter the
deserving homeless are edgy over having strangers sleep in their beds,
read their books, and play with their stereos. Or even steal their beds,
their books, and their stereos. Student Residences Manager Alan
Cummings assured us that he is considering providing storage, or
maybe installing padlocks on closets. Hut this campus' clever breed of
thief is likely to look on such measures as a challenge. And Cummings
was no more definite on this score than his office has been on any
other.
To top it oil, there is talk in some places that the University has
calculated the fuel savings all wrong, and that the closing may be
hardly worth the hassle.
There may be only a few students who are seriously
inconvenienced by the closing. Hut there are many others who will be
inconvenienced in some small way; and all those small inconveniences
could have been averted had the thing been better managed.
It seems inevitable that energy shortages will bring discomfort.
Administrators should minimize such problems, not compound them.

at least more advance warning — from their landlords.
Students who had planned to stay a lew days alter exams end on
Dec. I 5, or to return a few days before registration on Jan. 4, or even
to stay on campus lor the entire vacation, are suddenly recasting their
plans.
The tardiness of the announcement was .striking. So is the
persistent inability of University officials to estimate how many
students will be allowed to stay, what reasons for staying will be
deemed "legitimate, and which dorms will be open and which w ill be
closed.
Both of these striking things arouse suspicion that there is more
panic than planning in this end of the University 's energy policy
that a way to save fuel had to be found, that dormitory residents were
fixed on as the goats, and that nobody thought very far beyond that.
The rest of the process seems to be jury-rigged. The Housing Office
is accepting petitions to stay in the dorms until tomorrow. They have
no estimate of how many petitions are coming in, and so won't tell
residents whether they can stay, or where until "the middle of next
week —al the earliest. That catches students right in the middle of
dead week, a lousy time to disrupt anyone's life.
That isn t all. Housing officials won't decide what reasons lor
staying are "legitimate until they know how many people want to
stay. Students who want to stay, even for just a portion of the break,
have precious little advance idea of whether their applications will be
acceped.
Finally, the residents ol houses that will be used to shelter the
deserving homeless are edgy over having strangers sleep in their beds,
read their books, and play with their stereos. Or even steal their beds,
their books, and their stereos. Student Residences Manager Alan
Cummings assured us that he is considering providing storage, or
maybe installing padlocks on closets. Hut this campus' clever breed of
thief is likely to look on such measures as a challenge. And Cummings
was no more definite on this score than his office has been on any
other.
To top it oil, there is talk in some places that the University has
calculated the fuel savings all wrong, and that the closing may be
hardly worth the hassle.
There may be only a few students who are seriously
inconvenienced by the closing. Hut there are many others who will be
inconvenienced in some small way; and all those small inconveniences
could have been averted had the thing been better managed.
It seems inevitable that energy shortages will bring discomfort.
Administrators should minimize such problems, not compound them.
The energy crisis hit home last week as dormitory-dwellers
discovered their residences will be-closed during the Christmas break.
A great wail has gone up Irom the residents, and with good reason.
Energy crisis or no, tenants arc accustomed to better treatment — or
at least more advance warning — from their landlords.
