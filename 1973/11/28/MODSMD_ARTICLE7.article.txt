# Energy Shortage In The Future
## Crisis Affects Politics, Environment 
### 
Larry Diamond

It is no easy task to sort out
the far-ranging effects that the
world energy shortage is likely to
have on our politics, environment
and way of life in the coming
years. The task is made more
difficult because the real extent of
the crisis is not being disclosed by
key policymakers who wish to
avoid blame for not preparing the
nation long ago.
We are in serious trouble — not
only because the crisis itself is
serious, but because our
governmental system has,
traditionally, been notoriously

incapable of planning for the
long-range in a careful and
rational way.
How will we choose between
maintaining our present fun and
comfortable style of life and
reducing our national
consumption to what it would be
in some more equitable
distribution of world resources?
Certainly, we are coming to
recognize that we aregoingto have
to tighten our belts some. The
reductions in highway speeds,
thermostat settings, frivolous
lighting, and the like, will be

grudgingly accepted by the
people.
Energy Hogs
But how far will politicians be
willing to go in redressing the
stark and untenable inequity of
this country, with only 5 percent
of the world's population,
annually consuming 27 percent of
the world's resource production
and fully one third of its energy?
If we are to begin to
meaningfully reduce this
disparity, it will mean changes in
life style far more sweeping than
simply cutting out speeding, hot
homes, and Christmas lights, even
more sweeping than reducing
Sunday driving and airline flights.
Mr. Nixon's first measures are
needed ones, but they are only a
small beginning.
If we are serious about all this,
we are going to have to root the
automobile out of the center of
our culture. All the big,
gas-gulping car models will have to
be permanently banned from the
road, and the smaller horsepower
designs that remain will have to be
only a supplement to efficient and
universally accessible systems of
rapid transit.
Reduced Standard
We will have to accept a
reduction in the average standard
of living, particularly among
upper class families, who consume
much more energy. We will have
to do with fewer time-saving
appliances; fewer pleasure boats
and trailers and campers; and less
television, particularly color TV,
which uses 50 percent more
energy than black and white. It
may mean smaller homes, and
rationing even of home energy. It
will certainly have to mean an end
to population growth.
Sweeping changes of this sort
are politically unpopular, and
most politicians are unlikely to
force on the voting public, or on
the favored industrial
constituencies they represent,
anything more than what is
minimally necessary to get us
through the short range future.
Take another decision area,
closely related: How will we
choose between the need to
protect the environment and the
need to get more energy however
we can?
Few Friends
So far, it sems that when push
comes to shove, the environment
has few important political
friends. The minute the crisis hit,
the Alaskan pipeline sailed
through the Congress, drowning
all the previous concern for the
possibility of major environmental
damage. Air pollution standards
are being relaxed, again permitting
the use of polluting fuels high in
sulfur.
On all fronts, the pressure will
be on to tap existing sources of
energy now and worry about the
ecological impact later. We are
likely to see an accelerated rush,
with fewer environmental
safeguards, to suck up offshore
oil, construct new atomic energy
plants, and strip mine the hell out
of Montana.
There are other decisions that
will have to be made, and there is

great reason to fear that they will
come down to a question of raw
power. For as resources become
more scarce, those who control
them become more powerful in
relation to those who depend on
them.
Oil Blackmail
We see this today in the
blackmail of oil-hungry industrial
powers by the oil-rich Arab
nations. Japan is slowly caving in
to their diplomatic demands, as is
most of Western Europe. The
energy noose is tightening around
their collective neck, and one
must wonder how long they will
tolerate its presence before they
remove it by military force.
Increasingly, the
underdeveloped nations with the
natural resources will attempt to
assert the power inherent in those
resources. If things get desperate
enough, it is possible to imagine a
popular groundswell for military
occupation, or a carving-up by the
big powers, of the critical resource
deposits in the world. This is the
stuff of world war, but when the
alternative is economic
strangulation, which course is a
society likely to choose?
Self-sufficiency in energy is a
laudable goal, but it lures us into
an illusory sense of security on
several counts. First, we risk badly
raping our environment to extract
or generate from within our own
borders the resources necessary to
keep going at anything near the
present pace.
International Instability
Second, even if we do
completely supply ourselves with
energy, the other major Western
powers have no hope of this.
Their policies will still be dictated
by desperate energy needs,
making for increasing
international instability and
perhaps increasing diplomatic
isolation of this country.
Finally, even if we become
self-sufficient in strictly energy
resources, we will remain very
dependent on other natural
resources such as rubber and tin.
The short-range, politically
popular response is precisely the
one Mr. Nixon is embracing —
America first, fortress America.
But this cannot be sufficient in a
world of such rapidly increasing
interdependence. We are in a
world-wide crisis, and we need a
cooperative international response
to it among both the supplying
and consuming countries.
Whether such an international
cooperative plan on energy
production and consumption is
even possible no one can
positively state right now. What
can be positively stated is that the
only alternative for the human
race is the collision that we are
presently heading for, not only
with the environment, but with
each other.
