# Draft Board Ignores Evidence
## Jim Thrower And Unequal Justice 
### 
: Michael Kresser

Chiseled above the columns
that support the Supreme Court
building in Washington are the
words "Equal Justice Under
Law." To Jim Thrower these
words must seem like someone's
bitter joke. Jim was convicted in
federal court of refusing to submit
to induction into the Army. On
October 26, he began serving a
two year sentence at the Federal
Penal Farm in Safford, Arizona.
Jim has the distinction of being
one of the criminal justice
system's greater mistakes. His
conviction was an error. His
imprisonment, even assuming a
valid conviction, serves no rational
end. Jim has been exhausted,
financially and emotionally, by a
four year struggle with our
government.
Jim Thrower should never have
been convicted. Prior to receiving
his induction notice, Jim sent to
his local draft board a letter from
Dr. Duane Hagan, a highly
respected Professor of Psychiatry
at St. Louis University. The letter
from Dr. Hagan informed the
board that Jim had "been
troubled with episodes of
depression" and had "suffered
overt paranoid ideation."
Dr. Hagan gave the board a
history of some of Jim's
emotional difficulties and
concluded: "In light of these
developments in his emotional
state, in my opinion, this man is
not a fit candidate for military
service at this time. I have advised
that he consider some psychiatric
treatment." Dr. Hagan's opinion
was later confirmed by two other
practicing psychiatrists.
Evidence Ignored
Jim's local board reacted rather
strangely to this evidence. In
short, the board ignored it. A
clerk sent Dr. Hagan's letter on to
the Armed Forces Entrance and
Examining Station (AFEES). The

members of Jim's local board
never even saw the letter. Anyone
familiar with AFEES work in
conducting physical and mental
examinations could predict what
happened there. After a
psychiatric "exam" that took
several minutes, Jim's file was
rubber stamped suitable for
induction. The local board then
issued the induction order that
was the basis for Jim's
prosecution.
But even a formless
bureaucracy, always hard to pin
down, is supposed to follow its
own rules and court
determinations of its
responsibilities — especially when
someone can be prosecuted for a
felony as a result of that bureau's
determinations. Jim's local board
violated its own regulations in the
way it ignored Jim's submission of
evidence. The board, by its own
rules, had the duty to examine
such evidence to see if it
warranted reopening Jim's 1-A
classification.
Four federal courts in other
parts of the country have held
that lack of consideration of such
evidence by a draft board is a
denial of due process — a violation
of a registrant's constitutional
rights. These courts ruled that
when draft boards so blatantly
disregard their own rules in
classifying a registrant, any
subsequent induction order is
invalid.
Similar .Cases
These courts have acquitted
defendants who, like Jim, were
the victims of a local draft board
refusal to consider evidence they
had submitted to obtain
reclassification. Four similarly
situated defendants were freed
by federal courts, while Jim was
convicted by Judge Samuel Conti
in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California.
The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of

Appeals upheld Jim's conviction
in a remarkable piece of legal
"reasoning." For those who can
find their wayarounda law library,
the Court's opinion in United
States v. Thrower can be found at
483 F. 2d 283.
At the moment, Jim's last
chance for a way out of his
personal nightmare is in the form
of a petition to the U.S. Supreme
Court to hear his case. But the
Supreme Court receives around
4000 such petitions each year and
grants only about 200 of these.
There are three supposed
justifications for locking people
up: deterrence, rehabilitation, and
retribution. Are any of these ends
served by locking up Jim Thrower
for two years?
No Longer An Offense
Deterrence is an unproved,
probably unproveable, but
nonetheless assumed effect of
imprisoning people. Some people
get locked up for public
drunkenness or car theft, and
others will see their example and
not commit the same offenses. So
runs the argument. But the
offense for which Jim is being
punished, and from which the
government wants to deter others,
no longer exists. There is no draft,
no current induction orders are
being issued. Today, you couldn't
repeat Jim's "crime" if you
wanted to.
Rehabilitation, as an end of
penal sanctions, presumes a
dangerousness of the person
locked up. This dangerousness will
be decreased or extinguished by a
stay in jail or prison, claim those
who offer rehabilitation as a
reason for punishment.
Personally, I would feel as safe in
a crowd of people who refused to
enter the Army as I would in a
cloistered convent. It was Jim's
refusal to become dangerous to
other human beings that led to his
prosecution by the government.
Given the current state of most
prisons, society will be lucky if
Jim emerges from two years of
imprisonment as non-violent as
when he went in.
Only in retribution can any
even half rational explanation for
Jim Thrower's imprisonment be
found. The retributive view rests
on the idea that the wickedness or
evil displayed by the offender
demands retaliation from society.
Retribution as a justification for
punishment has become
increasingly disreputable.
Punishment for purposes of
revenge just doesn't square with
many people's idea of an
enlightened society.
Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall in a separate
opinion on the death penalty case,
has said: "Punishment for the
sake of retribution is not
permissible under the Eighth
Amendment." The Eighth
Amendment contains the ban on
cruel and unusual punishment.
But even if retribution can

justify imprisonment, what
feelings of revenge are present in
society against Jim's refusal to
kill? Should society demand two
years of expiation from Jim
Thrower for his refusal to submit
to induction? Should it do so
when a government agency
ignored evidence of emotional
instability and unfitness for the
military?
The case of Jim Thrower has
dragged on now for over four
years. When Jim refused induction
in December, 1969, he was told
that his case would be turned over
to federal prosecutors, and that
they would contact him shortly.
Though Jim made no attempt to
flee or avoid prosecution, he
heard nothing for over two years.
The government did not get
around to indicting Jim until
January, 1972.
Expensive Battle
Fighting the government at the
trial and appellate level cost Jim
well over $5,000. By the time he
sought review by the Supreme
Court, Jim was forced to proceed
in forma pauperis, asking the
Court to waive fees and to
appoint an attorney to handle the
case. Between Jim's conviction in
June, 1972, and his imprisonment
last month, he was unable to find
steady work. Few people want to
hire a convicted felon, especially
one who is facing a two year
prison sentence. So in the unequal
contest entitled United States v.
Thrower, the United States has
already taken its toll, even if Jim
is released from prison before the
end of his two year term. That the
prosecution was handled by the
"Department of Justice" lands a
final Orwellian note to the case.
Perhaps Jim Thrower should be
allowed some disbelief in the
chiseled words above the Supreme
Court building. For like us, he
reads about Spiro Agnew's
probation at the Palm Springs
Country Club, and about Agnew's
budding business deals. Of course
Jim had no high office to trade
away, or a battery of lawyers to
negotiate with the Justice
Department.

allowed some disbelief in the

Chiseled above the columns
that support the Supreme Court
building in Washington are the
words "Equal Justice Under
Law." To Jim Thrower these
words must seem like someone's
bitter joke. Jim was convicted in
federal court of refusing to submit
to induction into the Army. On
October 26, he began serving a
two year sentence at the Federal
Penal Farm in Safford, Arizona.
Jim has the distinction of being
one of the criminal justice
system's greater mistakes. His
conviction was an error. His
imprisonment, even assuming a
valid conviction, serves no rational
end. Jim has been exhausted,
financially and emotionally, by a
four year struggle with our
government.
Jim Thrower should never have
been convicted. Prior to receiving
his induction notice, Jim sent to
his local draft board a letter from
Dr. Duane Hagan, a highly
respected Professor of Psychiatry
at St. Louis University. The letter
from Dr. Hagan informed the
board that Jim had "been
troubled with episodes of
depression" and had "suffered
overt paranoid ideation."
Dr. Hagan gave the board a
history of some of Jim's
emotional difficulties and
concluded: "In light of these
developments in his emotional
state, in my opinion, this man is
not a fit candidate for military
service at this time. I have advised
that he consider some psychiatric
treatment." Dr. Hagan's opinion
was later confirmed by two other
practicing psychiatrists.
Evidence Ignored
Jim's local board reacted rather
strangely to this evidence. In
short, the board ignored it. A
clerk sent Dr. Hagan's letter on to
the Armed Forces Entrance and
Examining Station (AFEES). The

members of Jim's local board
never even saw the letter. Anyone
familiar with AFEES work in
conducting physical and mental
examinations could predict what
happened there. After a
psychiatric "exam" that took
several minutes, Jim's file was
rubber stamped suitable for
induction. The local board then
issued the induction order that
was the basis for Jim's
prosecution.
But even a formless
bureaucracy, always hard to pin
down, is supposed to follow its
own rules and court
determinations of its
responsibilities — especially when
someone can be prosecuted for a
felony as a result of that bureau's
determinations. Jim's local board
violated its own regulations in the
way it ignored Jim's submission of
evidence. The board, by its own
rules, had the duty to examine
such evidence to see if it
warranted reopening Jim's 1-A
classification.
Four federal courts in other
parts of the country have held
that lack of consideration of such
evidence by a draft board is a
denial of due process — a violation
of a registrant's constitutional
rights. These courts ruled that
when draft boards so blatantly
disregard their own rules in
classifying a registrant, any
subsequent induction order is
invalid.
Similar .Cases
These courts have acquitted
defendants who, like Jim, were
the victims of a local draft board
refusal to consider evidence they
had submitted to obtain
reclassification. Four similarly
situated defendants were freed
by federal courts, while Jim was
convicted by Judge Samuel Conti
in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California.
The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of

Appeals upheld Jim's conviction
in a remarkable piece of legal
"reasoning." For those who can
find their wayarounda law library,
the Court's opinion in United
States v. Thrower can be found at
483 F. 2d 283.
At the moment, Jim's last
chance for a way out of his
personal nightmare is in the form
of a petition to the U.S. Supreme
Court to hear his case. But the
Supreme Court receives around
4000 such petitions each year and
grants only about 200 of these.
There are three supposed
justifications for locking people
up: deterrence, rehabilitation, and
retribution. Are any of these ends
served by locking up Jim Thrower
for two years?
No Longer An Offense
Deterrence is an unproved,
probably unproveable, but
nonetheless assumed effect of
imprisoning people. Some people
get locked up for public
drunkenness or car theft, and
others will see their example and
not commit the same offenses. So
runs the argument. But the
offense for which Jim is being
punished, and from which the
government wants to deter others,
no longer exists. There is no draft,
no current induction orders are
being issued. Today, you couldn't
repeat Jim's "crime" if you
wanted to.
Rehabilitation, as an end of
penal sanctions, presumes a
dangerousness of the person
locked up. This dangerousness will
be decreased or extinguished by a
stay in jail or prison, claim those
who offer rehabilitation as a
reason for punishment.
Personally, I would feel as safe in
a crowd of people who refused to
enter the Army as I would in a
cloistered convent. It was Jim's
refusal to become dangerous to
other human beings that led to his
prosecution by the government.
Given the current state of most
prisons, society will be lucky if
Jim emerges from two years of
imprisonment as non-violent as
when he went in.
Only in retribution can any
even half rational explanation for
Jim Thrower's imprisonment be
found. The retributive view rests
on the idea that the wickedness or
evil displayed by the offender
demands retaliation from society.
Retribution as a justification for
punishment has become
increasingly disreputable.
Punishment for purposes of
revenge just doesn't square with
many people's idea of an
enlightened society.
Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall in a separate
opinion on the death penalty case,
has said: "Punishment for the
sake of retribution is not
permissible under the Eighth
Amendment." The Eighth
Amendment contains the ban on
cruel and unusual punishment.
But even if retribution can

justify imprisonment, what
feelings of revenge are present in
society against Jim's refusal to
kill? Should society demand two
years of expiation from Jim
Thrower for his refusal to submit
to induction? Should it do so
when a government agency
ignored evidence of emotional
instability and unfitness for the
military?
The case of Jim Thrower has
dragged on now for over four
years. When Jim refused induction
in December, 1969, he was told
that his case would be turned over
to federal prosecutors, and that
they would contact him shortly.
Though Jim made no attempt to
flee or avoid prosecution, he
heard nothing for over two years.
The government did not get
around to indicting Jim until
January, 1972.
Expensive Battle
Fighting the government at the
trial and appellate level cost Jim
well over $5,000. By the time he
sought review by the Supreme
Court, Jim was forced to proceed
in forma pauperis, asking the
Court to waive fees and to
appoint an attorney to handle the
case. Between Jim's conviction in
June, 1972, and his imprisonment
last month, he was unable to find
steady work. Few people want to
hire a convicted felon, especially
one who is facing a two year
prison sentence. So in the unequal
contest entitled United States v.
Thrower, the United States has
already taken its toll, even if Jim
is released from prison before the
end of his two year term. That the
prosecution was handled by the
"Department of Justice" lands a

Fighting the government at the
trial and appellate level cost Jim
well over $5,000. By the time he
sought review by the Supreme
Court, Jim was forced to proceed
in forma pauperis, asking the
Court to waive fees and to
appoint an attorney to handle the
case. Between Jim's conviction in
June, 1972, and his imprisonment
last month, he was unable to find
steady work. Few people want to
hire a convicted felon, especially
one who is facing a two year
prison sentence. So in the unequal
contest entitled United States v.
Thrower, the United States has
already taken its toll, even if Jim
is released from prison before the
end of his two year term. That the
prosecution was handled by the
"Department of Justice" lands a
final Orwellian note to the case.
Perhaps Jim Thrower should be
allowed some disbelief in the
chiseled words above the Supreme
Court building. For like us, he
reads about Spiro Agnew's
probation at the Palm Springs
Country Club, and about Agnew's
budding business deals. Of course
Jim had no high office to trade
away, or a battery of lawyers to
negotiate with the Justice
Department.

Chiseled above the columns
that support the Supreme Court
building in Washington are the
words "Equal Justice Under
Law." To Jim Thrower these
words must seem like someone's
bitter joke. Jim was convicted in
federal court of refusing to submit
to induction into the Army. On
October 26, he began serving a
two year sentence at the Federal
Penal Farm in Safford, Arizona.
Jim has the distinction of being
one of the criminal justice
system's greater mistakes. His
conviction was an error. His
imprisonment, even assuming a
valid conviction, serves no rational
end. Jim has been exhausted,
financially and emotionally, by a
four year struggle with our
government.
Jim Thrower should never have
been convicted. Prior to receiving
his induction notice, Jim sent to
his local draft board a letter from
Dr. Duane Hagan, a highly
respected Professor of Psychiatry
at St. Louis University. The letter
from Dr. Hagan informed the
board that Jim had "been
troubled with episodes of
depression" and had "suffered
overt paranoid ideation."
Dr. Hagan gave the board a
history of some of Jim's
emotional difficulties and
concluded: "In light of these
developments in his emotional
state, in my opinion, this man is
not a fit candidate for military
service at this time. I have advised
that he consider some psychiatric
treatment." Dr. Hagan's opinion
was later confirmed by two other
practicing psychiatrists.
Evidence Ignored
Jim's local board reacted rather
strangely to this evidence. In
short, the board ignored it. A
clerk sent Dr. Hagan's letter on to
the Armed Forces Entrance and
Examining Station (AFEES). The

members of Jim's local board
never even saw the letter. Anyone
familiar with AFEES work in
conducting physical and mental
examinations could predict what
happened there. After a
psychiatric "exam" that took
several minutes, Jim's file was
rubber stamped suitable for
induction. The local board then
issued the induction order that
was the basis for Jim's
prosecution.
But even a formless
bureaucracy, always hard to pin
down, is supposed to follow its
own rules and court
determinations of its
responsibilities — especially when
someone can be prosecuted for a
felony as a result of that bureau's
determinations. Jim's local board
violated its own regulations in the
way it ignored Jim's submission of
evidence. The board, by its own
rules, had the duty to examine
such evidence to see if it
warranted reopening Jim's 1-A
classification.
Four federal courts in other
parts of the country have held
that lack of consideration of such
evidence by a draft board is a
denial of due process — a violation
of a registrant's constitutional
rights. These courts ruled that
when draft boards so blatantly
disregard their own rules in
classifying a registrant, any
subsequent induction order is
invalid.
Similar .Cases
These courts have acquitted
defendants who, like Jim, were
the victims of a local draft board
refusal to consider evidence they
had submitted to obtain
reclassification. Four similarly
situated defendants were freed
by federal courts, while Jim was
convicted by Judge Samuel Conti
in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California.
The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of

Appeals upheld Jim's conviction
in a remarkable piece of legal
"reasoning." For those who can
find their wayarounda law library,
the Court's opinion in United
States v. Thrower can be found at
483 F. 2d 283.
At the moment, Jim's last
chance for a way out of his
personal nightmare is in the form
of a petition to the U.S. Supreme
Court to hear his case. But the
Supreme Court receives around
4000 such petitions each year and
grants only about 200 of these.
There are three supposed
justifications for locking people
up: deterrence, rehabilitation, and
retribution. Are any of these ends
served by locking up Jim Thrower
for two years?
No Longer An Offense
Deterrence is an unproved,
probably unproveable, but
nonetheless assumed effect of
imprisoning people. Some people
get locked up for public
drunkenness or car theft, and
others will see their example and
not commit the same offenses. So
runs the argument. But the
offense for which Jim is being
punished, and from which the
government wants to deter others,
no longer exists. There is no draft,
no current induction orders are
being issued. Today, you couldn't
repeat Jim's "crime" if you
wanted to.
Rehabilitation, as an end of
penal sanctions, presumes a
dangerousness of the person
locked up. This dangerousness will
be decreased or extinguished by a
stay in jail or prison, claim those
who offer rehabilitation as a
reason for punishment.
Personally, I would feel as safe in
a crowd of people who refused to
enter the Army as I would in a
cloistered convent. It was Jim's
refusal to become dangerous to
other human beings that led to his
prosecution by the government.
Given the current state of most
prisons, society will be lucky if
Jim emerges from two years of
imprisonment as non-violent as
when he went in.
Only in retribution can any
even half rational explanation for
Jim Thrower's imprisonment be
found. The retributive view rests
on the idea that the wickedness or
evil displayed by the offender
demands retaliation from society.
Retribution as a justification for
punishment has become
increasingly disreputable.
Punishment for purposes of
revenge just doesn't square with
many people's idea of an
enlightened society.
Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall in a separate
opinion on the death penalty case,
has said: "Punishment for the
sake of retribution is not
permissible under the Eighth
Amendment." The Eighth
Amendment contains the ban on
cruel and unusual punishment.
But even if retribution can

justify imprisonment, what
feelings of revenge are present in
society against Jim's refusal to
kill? Should society demand two
years of expiation from Jim
Thrower for his refusal to submit
to induction? Should it do so
when a government agency
ignored evidence of emotional
instability and unfitness for the
military?
The case of Jim Thrower has
dragged on now for over four
years. When Jim refused induction
in December, 1969, he was told
that his case would be turned over
to federal prosecutors, and that
they would contact him shortly.
Though Jim made no attempt to
flee or avoid prosecution, he
heard nothing for over two years.
The government did not get
around to indicting Jim until
January, 1972.

well over $5,000. By the time he

Thrower for his refusal to submit
to induction? Should it do so
when a government agency
ignored evidence of emotional
instability and unfitness for the
military?
The case of Jim Thrower has
dragged on now for over four
years. When Jim refused induction
in December, 1969, he was told
that his case would be turned over
to federal prosecutors, and that
they would contact him shortly.
Though Jim made no attempt to
flee or avoid prosecution, he
heard nothing for over two years.
The government did not get
around to indicting Jim until
January, 1972.
Expensive Battle
Fighting the government at the
trial and appellate level cost Jim
well over $5,000. By the time he
sought review by the Supreme
Court, Jim was forced to proceed
in forma pauperis, asking the
Court to waive fees and to
appoint an attorney to handle the
case. Between Jim's conviction in
June, 1972, and his imprisonment
last month, he was unable to find
steady work. Few people want to
hire a convicted felon, especially
one who is facing a two year
prison sentence. So in the unequal
contest entitled United States v.
Thrower, the United States has
already taken its toll, even if Jim
is released from prison before the
end of his two year term. That the
prosecution was handled by the
"Department of Justice" lands a
final Orwellian note to the case.
Perhaps Jim Thrower should be
allowed some disbelief in the
chiseled words above the Supreme
Court building. For like us, he
reads about Spiro Agnew's
probation at the Palm Springs
Country Club, and about Agnew's
budding business deals. Of course
Jim had no high office to trade
away, or a battery of lawyers to
negotiate with the Justice
Department.

Chiseled above the columns
that support the Supreme Court
building in Washington are the
words "Equal Justice Under
Law." To Jim Thrower these
words must seem like someone's
bitter joke. Jim was convicted in
federal court of refusing to submit
to induction into the Army. On
October 26, he began serving a
two year sentence at the Federal
Penal Farm in Safford, Arizona.
Jim has the distinction of being
one of the criminal justice
system's greater mistakes. His
conviction was an error. His
imprisonment, even assuming a
valid conviction, serves no rational
end. Jim has been exhausted,
financially and emotionally, by a
four year struggle with our
government.
Jim Thrower should never have
been convicted. Prior to receiving
his induction notice, Jim sent to
his local draft board a letter from
Dr. Duane Hagan, a highly
respected Professor of Psychiatry
at St. Louis University. The letter
from Dr. Hagan informed the
board that Jim had "been
troubled with episodes of
depression" and had "suffered
overt paranoid ideation."
Dr. Hagan gave the board a
history of some of Jim's
emotional difficulties and
concluded: "In light of these
developments in his emotional
state, in my opinion, this man is
not a fit candidate for military
service at this time. I have advised
that he consider some psychiatric
treatment." Dr. Hagan's opinion
was later confirmed by two other
practicing psychiatrists.
Evidence Ignored
Jim's local board reacted rather
strangely to this evidence. In
short, the board ignored it. A
clerk sent Dr. Hagan's letter on to
the Armed Forces Entrance and
Examining Station (AFEES). The

members of Jim's local board
never even saw the letter. Anyone
familiar with AFEES work in
conducting physical and mental
examinations could predict what
happened there. After a
psychiatric "exam" that took
several minutes, Jim's file was
rubber stamped suitable for
induction. The local board then
issued the induction order that
was the basis for Jim's
prosecution.
But even a formless
bureaucracy, always hard to pin
down, is supposed to follow its
own rules and court
determinations of its
responsibilities — especially when
someone can be prosecuted for a
felony as a result of that bureau's
determinations. Jim's local board
violated its own regulations in the
way it ignored Jim's submission of
evidence. The board, by its own
rules, had the duty to examine
such evidence to see if it
warranted reopening Jim's 1-A
classification.
Four federal courts in other
parts of the country have held
that lack of consideration of such
evidence by a draft board is a
denial of due process — a violation
of a registrant's constitutional
rights. These courts ruled that
when draft boards so blatantly
disregard their own rules in
classifying a registrant, any
subsequent induction order is
invalid.
Similar .Cases
These courts have acquitted
defendants who, like Jim, were
the victims of a local draft board
refusal to consider evidence they
had submitted to obtain
reclassification. Four similarly
situated defendants were freed
by federal courts, while Jim was
convicted by Judge Samuel Conti
in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California.
The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of

Appeals upheld Jim's conviction
in a remarkable piece of legal
"reasoning." For those who can
find their wayarounda law library,
the Court's opinion in United
States v. Thrower can be found at
483 F. 2d 283.
At the moment, Jim's last
chance for a way out of his
personal nightmare is in the form
of a petition to the U.S. Supreme
Court to hear his case. But the
Supreme Court receives around
4000 such petitions each year and
grants only about 200 of these.
There are three supposed
justifications for locking people
up: deterrence, rehabilitation, and
retribution. Are any of these ends
served by locking up Jim Thrower
for two years?
No Longer An Offense
Deterrence is an unproved,
probably unproveable, but
nonetheless assumed effect of
imprisoning people. Some people
get locked up for public
drunkenness or car theft, and
others will see their example and
not commit the same offenses. So
runs the argument. But the
offense for which Jim is being
punished, and from which the
government wants to deter others,
no longer exists. There is no draft,
no current induction orders are
being issued. Today, you couldn't
repeat Jim's "crime" if you
wanted to.
Rehabilitation, as an end of
penal sanctions, presumes a
dangerousness of the person
locked up. This dangerousness will
be decreased or extinguished by a
stay in jail or prison, claim those
who offer rehabilitation as a
reason for punishment.
Personally, I would feel as safe in
a crowd of people who refused to
enter the Army as I would in a
cloistered convent. It was Jim's
refusal to become dangerous to
other human beings that led to his
prosecution by the government.
Given the current state of most
prisons, society will be lucky if
Jim emerges from two years of
imprisonment as non-violent as
when he went in.
Only in retribution can any
even half rational explanation for
Jim Thrower's imprisonment be
found. The retributive view rests
on the idea that the wickedness or
evil displayed by the offender
demands retaliation from society.
Retribution as a justification for
punishment has become
increasingly disreputable.
Punishment for purposes of
revenge just doesn't square with
many people's idea of an
enlightened society.
Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall in a separate
opinion on the death penalty case,
has said: "Punishment for the
sake of retribution is not
permissible under the Eighth
Amendment." The Eighth
Amendment contains the ban on
cruel and unusual punishment.
But even if retribution can

justify imprisonment, what
feelings of revenge are present in
society against Jim's refusal to
kill? Should society demand two
years of expiation from Jim
Thrower for his refusal to submit
to induction? Should it do so
when a government agency
ignored evidence of emotional
instability and unfitness for the
military?
