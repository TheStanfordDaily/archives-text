# Dorm Heat Shutdown Probable

### JOHN FREED 
Heating shutdowns in student
residences will probably be necessary
to assure continuing energy supplies
for hospital services, Stanford's chief
energy allocator claimed yesterday.
Dan DeYoung, manager of plant
services, said at a hastily called press
conference that he favors shutting off
heat to student residences the next
time Pacific Gas & Electric cuts off
Stanford's supply of natural gas
because of Medical Center energy
requirements. The power company did
shut off gas last Tuesday.
"If we don't get an increased oil
allocation, I would recommend that
we not heat the dormitories, as well as
the academic buildings that we shut
off over the Thanksgiving weekend,"
DeYoung said.
Last Tuesday, when PG&E cut off
gas supplies, Stanford burned 25,000
gallons of fuel oil, leaving 110,000
gallons in reserve. Because
consumption at the Medical Center
averages 10,000 gallons per day, the
reserve tanks will hold 11 days of
heating energy if hospital and certain
research facilities alone are heated.
The supply would last just four
more days if plant services continued
to heat all campus buildings with
reserve fuel.
PG&E says it will cut off gas
supplies for another 2.6 days this
winter, assuming nation-wide weather
conditions are "normal." A severe
winter could cause longer cut-offs, but
would not likely reach the 11-day
limit, DeYoung claimed.
DeYoung maintained that the
actual temperatures in dorms will stay
about the same during the day-long
shutdowns. DeYoung cited the
minimal heat loss in academic
buildings over the four-day
Thanksgiving weekend as evidence.
"We don't think it will make any
difference in the dorms for one day.
The buildings I checked over
Thanksgiving had an average 55 degree
temperature after four days. I would
say dormitories are constructed as well
[as the buildings checked! DeYoung
said.
One noticeable change would be
the absence of hot water on shutdown
days.
DeYoung said that even if gas is cut
off for two consecutive days, the heat
loss would not be large. "I went into
several buildings [after two days
without heat], and it felt like the heat
was still on," he said.
The action will be necessary
because the federal government has
not raised oil allocations for hospitals.
DeYoung hoped that such action
would come soon, to avert heating
shutdowns. He referred to President
Nixon's energy message: "[Nixon]
seemed to say hospitals would not be
cut. But we haven't seen that oil in our
tanks."
PG&E cuts off gas to large
institutional users like Stanford when
the federal government orders gas sent
to other parts of the country,
according to DeYoung.
