# Presidential Candidate, Perhaps?
## Reagan Rhetoric Pleases The South

GREENVILLE, Miss., Nov. 21
— California Gov. Ronald Reagan
is running for President again, and
he's running hard. As a brief but
highly-visible swing into
Mississippi last weekend clearly
showed, he's got his most easily
conquered political territory
already staked out; Reagan is after
the Agnew vote, particularly the
Agnew vote in the South.
The Republican governor was
in Mississippi to address the state
GOP's "New Majority Dinner"

and to court (and to be courted
by) leaders of the Mississippi
Republican Party — especially
Clarke Reed, the powerful state
party chairman and head of the
Southern Association of
Republican State Chairmen.
Reed, in fact, was a strong
supporter of former Vice
President Spiro Agnew and was
one of the architects of President
Nixon's "Southern Strategy." He
is perhaps the only state party
chairman to express continuous
across-the-board praise of the
President's handling of the
Watergate crisis (except that he
privately criticized the President
for appointing Archibald Cox and
Elliot Richardson).
After Agnew's sudden
resignation, Reagan's name was
one of three (along with former
Texas Gov. John Connally and
Sen. Barry Goldwater) submitted
by Reed and other Mississippi
party officials to the Republican
National Committee to be passed
along to the President for his
consideration before designating a
vice presidential nominee.
The California governor took
careful notice of Reed's previous
support for him, his conservative
philosophy and his quiet power
during his brief stay in Mississippi.
Recognizing that he is extremely
attractive to many conservative

southern voters — Democrats and
Republicans alike — Reagan
acknowledged Reed and his own
conservatism at an airport press
conference: "If there's a
'Southern Strategy,' I'm a part of
it,"he said.
Reagan knows that he has great
potential in Mississippi, which, for
the most part, is "Nixon
country." The President made his
strongest showing here in 1972,
and a recent poll by the
ultra-conservative Jackson Daily
News showed that,97.9 percent of
the paper's readers who responded
want the President to remain in
office.
The governor took more than
just judicial notice of the
President's continuing popularity
here. Three days before he
t traveled to Mississippi, Reagan
was asked at a Sacramento news
conference if he supported the
President's handling of the
Watergate affair.
His reply — in the politically
explosive state of California — was
a simple "no comment."
But deep in the heart of Dixie,
the governor told inquiring
reporters that a presidential
resignation or impeachment is not
"in the cards."
"I think the man is entitled to
be believed and certainly he has
the right that any of us have to be

presumed innocent until someone
proves him guilty," Reagan said.
Reagan journeyed south to test
the political waters and to speak
to some of the party faithful. His
well-received speech at the
$100-a-plate fundraiser proved to
be a potent combination of Spiro
Agnew and George Wallace.
A liberal Democrat at the
height of his popularity as a movie
star, Reagan told his audience —
many of whom were recent
converts to Republicanism — that
the Democratic party is "still in
the hands of those who hijacked
that party in 1972. ...
"The present effort to pretend
that the left-wing radicalism of
last year has been moderated is
cynical, political expediency,"
Reagan declared.
But the rhetoric worsened and
the apparent lack of
comprehension grew more
obvious. "It would seem that the
American people have a better
sense of fair play than to blanket
indict the entire (Republican)
party for misdeeds of a few overly
zealous campaign workers," he
said. Even the President has
abandoned that particular
rationalization.
Or: "It is not we who accepted
the idea in recent years that
dissenters could choose the laws
they would obey and the laws
they would violate. We want the
law to take its course; we want
justice to be done.
"But in saying that, let us
make it plain that that does not
include standing silently by while
a vindictive mob of politically
motivated vigilantes tries to
reverse the mandate the people
gave this country in 1972." Surely
those words are a rhetorical, if not
a logical, equivalent of Agnew's
now-famous "effete corps of
impudent snobs."
Northern liberals, a favorite
target of local politicians, were
also the target of some of the
governor's commentary: "The
Fifth Avenue Porsche 'n poodle
set," he declared, "Only finds you
socially acceptable when you're
voting the straight Democratic
ticket."
And finally, the governor
borrowed — if not stole — some of
George Wallace's favorite lines;
states' rights, he told the cheering
audience, are the "greatest
guarantee of freedom that we
have in our system."
Gov. Reagan clearly scored a
hit with the Mississippi party
leaders and with the party's
monied (and mostly, although not
exclusively, white) rank-and-file.
Reed, for example, looked
exhilarated both after Reagan's
speech and the next night, when
he hosted an informal
"get-together" for Reagan and a
number of other Republican
officials in Greenville.
Reed wasn't the only person
pleased with the governor's
appearance. Said another
Mississippi GOP leader: "I haven't
applauded so much since a
Goldwater rally ... at this point,
Reagan is head-over-heels in
front."
Declared another party regular:
"He's an extremely persuasive
speaker and I'm sure he's the
strongest man we can field in
1976."
So Gov. Reagan, despite his
no-comments for newsmen
whenever he's asked about a
possible run for the presidency
three years from now, seems to be
in the catbird seat, at least as far
as Mississippi Republicans are
concerned. Whether he is
successful in his attempt to
enlarge his constituency will
determine whether or not he will
improve on the lackluster showing
he made during his 1968 run for
the Oval Office.
