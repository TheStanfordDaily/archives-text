ASSU Course Review
Editor:
As Stanford grows, the number
of courses offered each quarter
grows with it. Today the student
leafs through the catalogue and is
guided by little else than the
course name in the process of
selecting courses. In order to get
an idea of what other students
have thought of a course, one
would have to know everyone and
their brother on campus.
The ASSU Course Review is
designed to help students choose
their classes wisely, with some
knowledge of how others have
judged a particular course. The
Course Review should, ideally, be
used in conjunction with the
Course Abstracts, for the latter
outlines the mechnical skeleton of
the course, where the former
presents the reader with a
summary of the general consensus
of student opinion.
The Course Review editorial
staff is committed to turning out
a publication that meets its
twofold responsibility. First, there
is an explicit responsibility to the
students who fund the
publication, through the ASSU
Program Fee, to turn out as
informative and accurate a review
as possible.
Second, there is an implicit
responsibility to reflect the true
nature of general student opinion,
so that each professor reviewed is
assured of honest and fair
treatment. The Course Review is
not intended to be a punitive
instrument for student
disaffection, but a viable means of
communication between students
and teachers that can
constructively lead to course
improvements.
We sincerely hope that
students will conscientiously
answer all questions on the Course
Review questionnaires, and add
any relevant comments on the
back of the questionnaires,
bearing in mind that their efforts

will ultimately be rewarded with
an opportunity to receive
information from other students
regarding other courses.
In order to turn out a first rate
publication, the Course Review
staff needs manpower. We need
people to coordinate departments,
and to help write individual
reviews. If you are a registered
Stanford student, either graduate
or undergraduate, and would like
to help, please step forward. If
you are interested in working in
the natural sciences and
engineering departments please
call 328-0982; in the humanities,
328-4818; and in the social
sciences, 328-4507.
Our goal, ideally, is to have
each critique written by a student
in the particular class to better
interpret the comments and
statistics received in the
questionnaire's.
We also hope that professors
and instructors will lend us their
full cooperation in this enterprise.
Any suggestions (or complaints)
that you might have are entirely
welcome. We are quite aware that
our questionnaires do not ideally
meet the structure of all classes.

As a student who has taken the
Arms Control and Disarmament
Course, I found your article
(Daily, Nov. 19) to be a gross
misrepresentation of what the
course actually involves. Rather
than concentrating on the
decrease in the number of
students enrolled, it would have
been more valuable to focus on
the unique qualities of the
program.
The course is a two quarter
study consisting of lectures,

seminar groups and
professor-student projects. It
approaches the problem of arms
control and disarmament from the
political, historical, technical and
legal points of view. Each aspect is
covered in sufficient depth so as
to preclude any necessary
prerequisites. The student is also
given the rare opportunity of
working closely with one or more
professors from various faculties
of the University. Consequently,
it succeeds in offering a truly
interdisciplinary study.
Arms control and disarmament
is an extremely relevant problem
concering all members of our
society. Reporting on topics of
interest to the community is a
valuable service that the Daily
performs and, therefore, they
have a responsibility to do a more
thorough job of researching
before publishing their findings.

I believe that two comments
are in order concering Mr. Freed's
article in the Nov. 16 issue of the
Daily in which he speculates on
the political results of a possible
form of clinical faculty
appointments in the Medical
School. In the first place, I never
discussed with him the rationale
for such appointments and the
statements about this which he
attributes to me are spurious.
In the second, I offer my
observations, counter to the
suggestions of L. Herzenberg, that
faculty of clinical departments in
the Medical School are neither
more liberal nor more
conservative than faculty of other
departments throughout the
University, and certainly not
unusually disposed to side with
the administration.

I believe that two comments
are in order concering Mr. Freed's
article in the Nov. 16 issue of the
Daily in which he speculates on
the political results of a possible
form of clinical faculty
appointments in the Medical
School. In the first place, I never
discussed with him the rationale
for such appointments and the
statements about this which he
attributes to me are spurious.
In the second, I offer my
observations, counter to the
suggestions of L. Herzenberg, that
faculty of clinical departments in
the Medical School are neither
more liberal nor more
conservative than faculty of other
departments throughout the
University, and certainly not
unusually disposed to side with
the administration.

ASSU Course Review
Editor:
As Stanford grows, the number
of courses offered each quarter
grows with it. Today the student
leafs through the catalogue and is
guided by little else than the
course name in the process of
selecting courses. In order to get
an idea of what other students
have thought of a course, one
would have to know everyone and
their brother on campus.
The ASSU Course Review is
designed to help students choose
their classes wisely, with some
knowledge of how others have
judged a particular course. The
Course Review should, ideally, be
used in conjunction with the
Course Abstracts, for the latter
outlines the mechnical skeleton of
the course, where the former
presents the reader with a
summary of the general consensus
of student opinion.
The Course Review editorial
staff is committed to turning out
a publication that meets its
twofold responsibility. First, there
is an explicit responsibility to the
students who fund the
publication, through the ASSU
Program Fee, to turn out as
informative and accurate a review
as possible.
Second, there is an implicit
responsibility to reflect the true
nature of general student opinion,
so that each professor reviewed is
assured of honest and fair
treatment. The Course Review is
not intended to be a punitive
instrument for student
disaffection, but a viable means of
communication between students
and teachers that can
constructively lead to course
improvements.
We sincerely hope that
students will conscientiously
answer all questions on the Course
Review questionnaires, and add
any relevant comments on the
back of the questionnaires,
bearing in mind that their efforts

will ultimately be rewarded with
an opportunity to receive
information from other students
regarding other courses.
In order to turn out a first rate
publication, the Course Review
staff needs manpower. We need
people to coordinate departments,
and to help write individual
reviews. If you are a registered
Stanford student, either graduate
or undergraduate, and would like
to help, please step forward. If
you are interested in working in
the natural sciences and
engineering departments please
call 328-0982; in the humanities,
328-4818; and in the social
sciences, 328-4507.
Our goal, ideally, is to have
each critique written by a student
in the particular class to better
interpret the comments and
statistics received in the
questionnaire's.
We also hope that professors
and instructors will lend us their
full cooperation in this enterprise.
Any suggestions (or complaints)
that you might have are entirely
welcome. We are quite aware that
our questionnaires do not ideally
meet the structure of all classes.

people to coordinate departments,
and to help write individual
reviews. If you are a registered
Stanford student, either graduate
or undergraduate, and would like
to help, please step forward. If
you are interested in working in
the natural sciences and
engineering departments please
call 328-0982; in the humanities,
328-4818; and in the social
sciences, 328-4507.
Our goal, ideally, is to have
each critique written by a student
in the particular class to better
interpret the comments and
statistics received in the
questionnaire's.
We also hope that professors
and instructors will lend us their
full cooperation in this enterprise.
Any suggestions (or complaints)
that you might have are entirely
welcome. We are quite aware that
our questionnaires do not ideally
meet the structure of all classes.

Disarmament
Course Clarification
Editor:
As a student who has taken the
Arms Control and Disarmament
Course, I found your article
(Daily, Nov. 19) to be a gross
misrepresentation of what the
course actually involves. Rather
than concentrating on the
decrease in the number of
students enrolled, it would have
been more valuable to focus on
the unique qualities of the
program.
The course is a two quarter
study consisting of lectures,

seminar groups and
professor-student projects. It
approaches the problem of arms
control and disarmament from the
political, historical, technical and
legal points of view. Each aspect is
covered in sufficient depth so as
to preclude any necessary
prerequisites. The student is also
given the rare opportunity of
working closely with one or more
professors from various faculties
of the University. Consequently,
it succeeds in offering a truly
interdisciplinary study.
Arms control and disarmament
is an extremely relevant problem
concering all members of our
society. Reporting on topics of
interest to the community is a
valuable service that the Daily
performs and, therefore, they
have a responsibility to do a more
thorough job of researching
before publishing their findings.
Gail Block
Medical School Faculty
Editor:
I believe that two comments
are in order concering Mr. Freed's
article in the Nov. 16 issue of the
Daily in which he speculates on
the political results of a possible
form of clinical faculty
appointments in the Medical
School. In the first place, I never
discussed with him the rationale
for such appointments and the
statements about this which he
attributes to me are spurious.
In the second, I offer my
observations, counter to the
suggestions of L. Herzenberg, that
faculty of clinical departments in
the Medical School are neither
more liberal nor more
conservative than faculty of other
departments throughout the
University, and certainly not
unusually disposed to side with
the administration.
