# Separate From BART
## Transit System Proposed 
### 
San Francisco Supervisor
Quentin Kopp suggested Tuesday
night that Santa Clara County
should consider developing a
transit system separate from the
Bay Area Rapid Transit system
(BART).
Kopp, a member of the BART
board of directors, blasted the
performance of the BART
management in a speech to 25
people at the Garland School
sponsored by the Palo Alto Area
Democratic Association.
"People need to evaluate as to
whether a Santa Clara transit

system should be separate from or
a part of BART," said Kopp. The
numerous managerial problems
plaguing BART might have been
avoided in a separate system
under different management,
Kopp implied.
"BART is, frankly, in a panic
situation, and the chief problem is
management and the management
philosophy," he contended.
"Management has adopted a
laissez-faire attitude towards
BART's contractors which has
resulted in inaction in fixing
responsibility for system failures,"
Kopp said.
"The situation can be termed as
panic because BART has a
projected deficit of $100 million
which means that the state
legislature must bail BART out."
Kopp criticized management
for failing to collect damage
payments from firms responsibl

for system failures and for
carelessness in labor negotiations.
"Every department of BART is
overspending," he said. "The
system might begin to pay for
itself when the trans-bay route is
opened," but no one knows when
that will be, Lopp concluded.
Trans-bay operations are
impossible until BART's
automatic control system can be
perfected and certified by the
state.
