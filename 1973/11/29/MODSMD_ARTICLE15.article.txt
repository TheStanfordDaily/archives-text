# At Winterland
## Sha Na Na, ELO Amuse Crowd 
### JEFF EHRLICH 
SAN FRANCISCO - A fairly
packed Winterland greeted
Sha-Na-Na for their annual
Thanksgiving gig there (Nov. 23
and 24), and the crowd loved 'em.
What more is there to say?
Sha-Na-Na, like Bette Midler,
gives more of a "show" than a
"concert," and they do it
perfectly: perfect singing of oldie
rock 'n roll classics, perfect
choreography, and a fine variety
of costumes. Unfortunately, it's a
novelty, one that hasn't changed
that much in its four years.
As impressed as I was — and, at
times, amused — I couldn't "get
off." And I've never really seen
Sha-Na-Na except for the three
times I saw Woodstock and one
Flip Wilson TV show a couple
years back. Just knowing about

them and what they do takes
away the fun.
I'm sure that had I seen them
when they were first around, I
would have thought they were
tremendous. But precise shows
like Sha-Na-Na or Bette Midler
often depend on surprise for their
effectiveness, and there's little
surprise left to Sha-Na-Na.
The crowd wildly applauded as
the group returned for each of its
five planned encores. Don't get
me wrong — I had fun too, and I
helped the wild applause because
it was fun to do. But I have no
desire to see them again for a long
time.
The show included a dance
contest in which three of the
group's members selected partners
from the audience, brought them
on stage, and competed for the

crowd's applause. The "contest"
was MC'd nicely by Bowzer, the
ugly-looking bass vocalist who the
audience likes to throw stuff at
and verbally fight.
Typical 50s' Fare
The songs were Sha-Na-Na's
usual fare: classic oldies including
"Yakety Yak," "Duke of Earl,"
"Teenager in Love," their theme
song "Get a Job," their perennial
closer "At the Hop," and "Hound
Dog."
Of somewhat greater interest
was the second-billed act,
England's Electric Light
Orchestra. Equipped with two
cellists, a violinist and a
synthesizer in addition to the
basic guitar-bass-and-drums. They
performed with impressive
tightness and polish some of the

complex arrangements from their
second album.
They surprised everyone with a
rendition of "Day Tripper" that
went from heavy metal to a
Mozart piano sonata and back
again. They really had the crowd
moving with their hit rendition of
"Roll Over Beethoven," and were
enthusiastically called back for an
encore in which "In the Hall of
the Mountain King" become
"Great Balls of Fire." It was good
to see how well this vastly
under-rated group was received by
Sha-Na-Na's audience.
Opening the show was the
James Montgomery Band, the
latest punk rockers to emerge
from Boston. They'll never be
another J. Geils, but they're
perfect as a third bill evening
kick-off.
