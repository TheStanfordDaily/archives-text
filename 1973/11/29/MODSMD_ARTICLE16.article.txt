# ‘Shipwrecks' Probes Disaster
## 
### 
Although "Shipwrecks" is not
a usual subject for an art show,
the exhibition now on view at the
Stanford art gallery is surprisingly
interesting and well-arranged.
Man has always been fascinated
by the sea. Throughout literature
and the arts it has symbolized
man's continual battle against
fate, the forces of nature, and his
need for salvation. This exhibition
illustrates the attempts of artists
from the 17 th to the 20th
centuries to translate
contemporary journalistic events

into imagery reflecting this
fascination.
One of the most notorious sea
disasters was the 1816 incident on
Im Meduse. 150 people were
abandoned to survive on a crude
raft. Mutiny, cannibalism and
murder followed and only ten
people survived. The incident
might have been surpressed and
forgotten without Gericault's
powerful painting arousing public
indignation.
Balloon Wrecks
Paintings, etchings and
photographs illustrate many
well-known wrecks and sea
disasters. A small display depicts
balloon wrecks from the first
recorded ariel disaster in 1817 to
the Hindenburg explosion in
1937.
Sea lamps and nameboards lent
by the Maritime Museum help to
give the exhibition an authentic
flavor. Under the large wooden
nameboard for the SS Czarina is a
series of photographs illustrating
the view of the crew clinging to
the ship's mast as she slowly sinks.
Documents and old newspaper
articles record the events
concluding with the sinking of the
Titanic in 1912, the end of the
era.
One of the reasons for the
success of the exhibition is that it
is extremely well arranged. Like
the former show on Indian art, it
is artistically displayed,
informative and each work is
easily accessible. The exhibition
will continue through December
30.


SHIP AHOY—Maritime relics like
this one give the "Shipwrecks"
exhibit at the Stanford Art
Gallery an authentic flavor. The
display, featuring paintings,
etchings and photographs,
continues thru Friday.
