Lawyer Says Tape 'Spots' Not Erasures
WASHINGTON — A White House lawyer said
yesterday technicians told him there are other
conversationless spots on subpoenaed White House
Watergate tapes, but the spots represented no new
erasures in the tapes.
Lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt told a federal court that the
spots were discovered by technicians using an oscilloscope
while making copies of the tapes for the court.
It was Buzhardt who last week disclosed to U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica that an 18-minute gap existed
on a crucial Watergate tape.
Buzhardt said also that it was three months after he
received a memorandum from the special Watergate
prosecutor on the subpoena of presidential tapes before
he read it carefully enough to determine the subpoena
included the tape of the June 20 presidential conversation
with H.R. Haldeman.
He said the spots were not surprising because White
House tape machines once used to record Nixon's
conversations were actuated by sound, but not necessarily
by conversations only.
Shale Oil Development Critieized
DENVER — Wildlife would be destroyed and
environmental resources devastated under a government
program to lease federal lands for commercial
development of shale oil in three Western states, ecologists
said yesterday.
They reacted to Interior Secretary Rogers C.B.
Morton's announcement that 20-year leases on six federal
tracts in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming will be offered in
competitive bidding between Jan. 8 and June 4.
In a Washington news conference, Morton announced
two steps his department has taken to increase the
nation's fuel supplies over the long run:
— The leasing of the six tracts of federal lands, two
each in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.
— Asked the Justice Department to take the final legal
steps in preparation for issuing federal permits to build
the long-delayed trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
"Oil shale development is years away and it's a very
damaging process," said Carolyn Johnson of the Colorado
Open Space Council, a coalition of 30 environmental
groups including the Audubon Society and Sierra Club.
Johnson said the leasing was "a giveaway to the oil
industry under the label of energy crisis" and "represents
a commitment for destruction of great environmental
resources for a drop in the bucket of oil."
She said mining shale in western Colorado's Piceance
Basin could destroy 75 percent of the region's 30,000

deer.
Vegetation would be destroyed, roads would interrupt
wildlife migratory patterns and humans would flood the
area seeking jobs.
Morton said, "The leasing program I have approved will
encourage oil shale development and allow us to learn
whether our 600-billion-barrel shale oil reserves can be
developed at acceptable economic and environmental
costs."
Saxbe Eligibility Bill Passes
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday passed, 75 to
16, a bill intended to make Sen. William B. Saxbe,
R-Ohio, constitutionally eligible for appointment as
attorney general.
President Nixon has held up submission of Saxbe's
nomination awaiting passage of the legislation, which now
goes to the House.
Saxbe now is ineligible because in 1969, shortly after
he came to the Senate, the salary of the attorney general
and other Cabinet members was increased from $35,000 a
year to $60,000.
The Constitution provides that no member of Congress
shall, during the term for which he was elected, be
appointed to an office for which the salary was increased
during that time.
The bill the Senate passed attempts to clear this barrier
to Saxbe's nomination by rolling the salary of the
attorney general back to $35,000.
Gas Rationing Nears
WASHINGTON — Gasoline rationing is looming a step
closer as President Nixon's Cabinet-level energy group has
soured on fuel-saving tax ideas.
"Almost everybody is leaning toward rationing," an
administration source said, describing the attitudes
expressed in a meeting Tuesday of the Emergency Energy
Action Group assigned by Nixon to recommend
energy-crisis policy.
The source said even Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz, the strongest advocate of a gasoline tax to avoid
rationing, was "not all that firm" for taxes in the meeting.
But the group has not yet made up its mind and is to
discuss the issues again today, the source said.
Today's Weather
Rain likely at times today and tonight. Partly cloudy
Friday with chance of showers. Slightly cooler. Low
temperatures both nights in the mid 40s to lower 50s.
High Thursday and Friday in the mid to upper 50s.
Chance of rain 60 percent today and 70 percent tonight.
