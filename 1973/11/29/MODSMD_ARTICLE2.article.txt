# Supreme Court Upholds Stale Redistricting Plan
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The California Supreme Court
yesterday unanimously adopted a
reapportionment plan that
substantially alters the legislative
districts that include Stanford.
The court ruling, upholding a plan
submitted last summer by a panel of
three retired judges, compacts the
district of U.S. Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, and puts
the campus into new state Senate and
Assembly districts.
The Supreme Court stepped into
the reapportionment dispute after the
state legislature and Gov. Ronald
Reagan couldn't reach a compromise
during 2V£ years of haggling.
The three-judge panel, the Special
Masters, issued their recommendations
Aug. 31. The court yesterday upheld
virtually all their proposals, changing
only the numbering of Senate districts

in Los Angeles and Alameda counties.
The local effect of the remap plan
will generally be to reunite several
communities that had been split into
two or more districts under previous
remapping.
For instance, McCloskey's current
17th congressional district includes
four entire communities and portions
of 11 others, according to a district
spokesman. However, McCloskey's
new 12th district will include 11 entire
communities and portions of just two.
His new district will include a
portion of southern San Mateo
County, but most of the population
will be concentrated in northern Santa
Clara County. He will now represent
Los Altos, Los Altos Hills and several
other communities his district now
misses as it meanders 37 miles down
the Peninsula.
To compensate for the added

northern communities, McCloskey will
lose much of the long, narrow "arm"
that currently stretches as far south as
East San Jose.
The new Senate district, the 10th,
may or may not have an incumbent
running in it. The district combines
northern Santa Clara County with the
southern portion of a district now
represented by Sen. Arlen P. Gregorio,
D-San Mateo. Gregorio told the Daily
in September that he was leaning
toward running in the new district,
including Stanford, and a spokesman
said he would formally announce his
political plans today.
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R-Redwood City, told the Daily
yesterday that he may also be a
candidate for the Senate seat. Arnett,
a former director of community
relations at Stanford, said that he was
also still considering seeking reelection
to the Assembly.
"There are several things I'd have to
consider [before deciding to run for
the Senate]," he said. "There are
potent reasons to run for it — there are
a few things he [Gregorio] deserves to
be challenged on, although there are of
course many things we agree on.
"I'd also have to consider how
difficult it would be to start a
campaign in Santa Clara County,
where neither of us has ever run
before, how difficult it would be to
raise money and set up an
organization, how the county
Republican committee feels about it,
and so on," Arnett said.
Arnett speculated that it might be
easier for him to mount a campaign in
Santa Clara County because "I think I
probably know more people," but also
noted that Gregorio, if he ran, would
have an edge since he would be an
incumbent.
The new Assembly district, the
21st, will apparently be without an
incumbent candidate, since
Assemblyman Richard Hayden,
R-Sunnyvale, who currently represents
the Stanford area, is expected to seek
reelection in a more southerly district.
Possible contenders for the vacant
local seat include Democrats Victor J.
Calvo, a Santa Clara County
supervisor, and James Stewart, a Palo
Alto attorney and unsuccessful 1972
Democratic congressional nominee;
and Republicans Michael Cobb,
chairman of the county GOP central
committee, and Royce Cole, a Palo
Alto dentist who unsuccessfully
challenged McCloskey in the 1972
congressional primary.

The new Assembly district, the
21st, will apparently be without an
incumbent candidate, since
Assemblyman Richard Hayden,
R-Sunnyvale, who currently represents
the Stanford area, is expected to seek
reelection in a more southerly district.
Possible contenders for the vacant
local seat include Democrats Victor J.
Calvo, a Santa Clara County
supervisor, and James Stewart, a Palo
Alto attorney and unsuccessful 1972
Democratic congressional nominee;
and Republicans Michael Cobb,
chairman of the county GOP central
committee, and Royce Cole, a Palo
Alto dentist who unsuccessfully
challenged McCloskey in the 1972
congressional primary.

SEALE OF APPROVAL - Black Panther leader Bobby Seale last night endorsed
Panther-sponsored programs for helping blacks and chicanos control their
communities. He spoke in Memorial Auditorium to a crowd of 200.
The California Supreme Court
yesterday unanimously adopted a
reapportionment plan that
substantially alters the legislative
districts that include Stanford.
The court ruling, upholding a plan
submitted last summer by a panel of
three retired judges, compacts the
district of U.S. Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, and puts
the campus into new state Senate and
Assembly districts.
The Supreme Court stepped into
the reapportionment dispute after the
state legislature and Gov. Ronald
Reagan couldn't reach a compromise
during 2V£ years of haggling.
The three-judge panel, the Special
Masters, issued their recommendations
Aug. 31. The court yesterday upheld
virtually all their proposals, changing
only the numbering of Senate districts

in Los Angeles and Alameda counties.
The local effect of the remap plan
will generally be to reunite several
communities that had been split into
two or more districts under previous
remapping.
For instance, McCloskey's current
17th congressional district includes
four entire communities and portions
of 11 others, according to a district
spokesman. However, McCloskey's
new 12th district will include 11 entire
communities and portions of just two.
His new district will include a
portion of southern San Mateo
County, but most of the population
will be concentrated in northern Santa
Clara County. He will now represent
Los Altos, Los Altos Hills and several
other communities his district now
misses as it meanders 37 miles down
the Peninsula.
To compensate for the added

northern communities, McCloskey will
lose much of the long, narrow "arm"
that currently stretches as far south as
East San Jose.
The new Senate district, the 10th,
may or may not have an incumbent
running in it. The district combines
northern Santa Clara County with the
southern portion of a district now
represented by Sen. Arlen P. Gregorio,
D-San Mateo. Gregorio told the Daily
in September that he was leaning
toward running in the new district,
including Stanford, and a spokesman
said he would formally announce his
political plans today.
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R-Redwood City, told the Daily
yesterday that he may also be a
candidate for the Senate seat. Arnett,
a former director of community
relations at Stanford, said that he was
also still considering seeking reelection
to the Assembly.
"There are several things I'd have to
consider [before deciding to run for
the Senate]," he said. "There are
potent reasons to run for it — there are
a few things he [Gregorio] deserves to
be challenged on, although there are of
course many things we agree on.
"I'd also have to consider how
difficult it would be to start a
campaign in Santa Clara County,
where neither of us has ever run
before, how difficult it would be to
raise money and set up an
organization, how the county
Republican committee feels about it,
and so on," Arnett said.
Arnett speculated that it might be
easier for him to mount a campaign in
Santa Clara County because "I think I
probably know more people," but also
noted that Gregorio, if he ran, would
have an edge since he would be an
incumbent.
