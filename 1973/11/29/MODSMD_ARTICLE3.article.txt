# Seale Advocates Community Control

### MIKE PHILLIPS 
Arguing that blacks and chicanos
must control their own communities,
Black Panther Chairman Bobby Seale
says the Panthers offer "real and
concrete" programs for autonomy.
Speaking to a Memorial Auditorium
audience of 200 last evening, Seale
mentioned several of the party's
projects:

— The Community Learning
Center, an alternative educational
center for minority groups
— The Free Breakfast for Children's
program
— A proposed organization of
"1000 escorts and 100 vans" to
protect blacks in high-crime areas.
Seale, who ran unsuccessfully for
mayor of Oakland this past spring, said

that the programs the Panthers offer
are a means of protest to the
institutions blacks now live in.
"We see that the legislative bodies
in communities have never had the
interests of the people at heart," he
charged. "Institutions serve the
interest of the ruling class. They
perpetuate and maintain the
exploitation of the people."
'Shave It Down'
In order to improve the political
scene, Seale said, "We've got to start
electing some longhairs — just tell
them to shave it down a bit."
Seale claims that the protest
movement is dying down. In Oakland
he said that two "racists" ran
unopposed and were elected — in a
city that is 38 percent black.
Seale said that when he and Huey
Newton formed the Black Panther
Party they had visions of running for
office. The 10 point platform they
initiated in 1966 included such
demands as full employment, proper
housing and education and an end to
police brutality and was actually a
political platform. When riots broke
out in Watts and Los Angeles, Seale
said, the Panthers looked at it as a
"people's rebellion."
"In the riots we saw all this energy

being incarcerated," he added.
Seale also outlined the purpose of
the Community Learning Center,
saying that chilren are taught "how to
learn not what to learn."
"We take the kids down to the
courtroom. If we say 90 percent of
those on trial are blacks and chicanos
we take them 4own to the courtroom
and show them."
Seale argued that what the blacks
need now is a political "vehicle" to
voice their protests; claiming that
voting and participation in government
is crucial in the black community. He
claimed that he lost his bid in the
mayoral election because he lacked
enough precinct workers.
Police Harassment
Seale told of attempts of the
Panthers to protect the community
from police brutality by carrying
shotguns and a law book as they
followed patrol cars. He said that the
police began harassing them and jailed
numerous members.
"We became the political whipping
boys for the police," he said.
Arguing that the black community
must defend itself, Seale defended the
Panthers' right to carry guns.
"If the police attack us we defend
ourselves. That is part of the process
of revolution."
