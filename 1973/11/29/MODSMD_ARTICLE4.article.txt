### MARK SIMONIAN 
A cash bag containing $717 in
currency from the ASSU Sunday
Flicks has apparently been stolen from
a safe in the office of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety.
Officers first noticed the money
missing Tuesday afternoon when a
Flicks representative came to claim the
cash to deposit it in the bank, Public
Safety Director Marvin Herrington
told the Daily yesterday.
"We explored all the obvious
mistakes," but could not find the
money in the office, he explained.
"It's an apparent theft."
Herrington said he called in Santa
Clara County Sheriffs deputies to
assist with the investigation, but they
have no leads yet. KZSU News
yesterday first revealed the
disappearance of the money.
Safekeeping
The money was contained in one of
two cash bags that Flicks personnel
turned over to security department
officers for safekeeping Sunday night
after the second screening of Patton,
according to Herrington.
Officers then placed the money in a
safe in the public safety and fire

department common business office
and locked the safe, he said.
The safe, which he described as "an
old safe," is "locked during the night,
but normally unlocked during the
day." The area near the safe is
accessible to the public with business
in the office.
'Inside Job'
Herrington did not rule out the
possibility that the theft was "an
inside job," since there was no
evidence of forced entry into the safe
and"the combination was widely
known."
He said the department will cover
