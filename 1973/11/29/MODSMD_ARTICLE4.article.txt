# ASSU Cash Missing From Safety Dept.
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
A cash bag containing $717 in
currency from the ASSU Sunday
Flicks has apparently been stolen from
a safe in the office of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety.
Officers first noticed the money
missing Tuesday afternoon when a
Flicks representative came to claim the
cash to deposit it in the bank, Public
Safety Director Marvin Herrington
told the Daily yesterday.
"We explored all the obvious
mistakes," but could not find the
money in the office, he explained.
"It's an apparent theft."
Herrington said he called in Santa
Clara County Sheriffs deputies to
assist with the investigation, but they
have no leads yet. KZSU News
yesterday first revealed the
disappearance of the money.
Safekeeping
The money was contained in one of
two cash bags that Flicks personnel
turned over to security department
officers for safekeeping Sunday night
after the second screening of Patton,
according to Herrington.
Officers then placed the money in a
safe in the public safety and fire

department common business office
and locked the safe, he said.
The safe, which he described as "an
old safe," is "locked during the night,
but normally unlocked during the
day." The area near the safe is
accessible to the public with business
in the office.
'Inside Job'
Herrington did not rule out the
possibility that the theft was "an
inside job," since there was no
evidence of forced entry into the safe
and"the combination was widely
known."
He said the department will cover
the financial loss to the ASSU, but he
has not checked with the department's
insurance company yet.
Delivering the money to the public
safety department in the first place is
not the ASSU Sunday Flicks "usual
procedure," according to Flicks
manager Bob Sisson.
'Technicality'
But the usual procedure could not
be followed last Sunday because of "a
technicality" caused by the absence of
Jim Holbrook, Flicks box office
manager. Holbrook was vacationing in
Los Angeles.
Rocky Barber, former Flicks box
office manager, delivered the cash to
the station in two bags, one full of
currency, the other, coin. He said he
received a receipt for both bags. The
currency bag is missing.

"Nobody could have known that
the money was going to the police
station," Barber said. "I was the only
person who knew."
Herrington said he did not suspect
Flicks personnel of the theft, adding
that he was concerned about its poor
reflection on the department.
"There are six civilian employees
with the department in that office, as
well as six fire department employees,
and the office is open to the public.
Almost anybody could have stolen the
bag.
"There is still a possibility it may
turn up, but I can't think of any other
reason the money in the bag is gone
other than it's been stolen," he
concluded.
Sisson said he may wait until the
end of the quarter "to follow up the
details" of the theft.

technicality" caused by the absence of
Jim Holbrook, Flicks box office
manager. Holbrook was vacationing in
Los Angeles.
Rocky Barber, former Flicks box
office manager, delivered the cash to
the station in two bags, one full of
currency, the other, coin. He said he
received a receipt for both bags. The
currency bag is missing.

"Nobody could have known that
the money was going to the police
station," Barber said. "I was the only
person who knew."
Herrington said he did not suspect
Flicks personnel of the theft, adding
that he was concerned about its poor
reflection on the department.
"There are six civilian employees
with the department in that office, as
well as six fire department employees,
and the office is open to the public.
Almost anybody could have stolen the
bag.
"There is still a possibility it may
turn up, but I can't think of any other
reason the money in the bag is gone
other than it's been stolen," he
concluded.
Sisson said he may wait until the
end of the quarter "to follow up the
details" of the theft.
A cash bag containing $717 in
currency from the ASSU Sunday
Flicks has apparently been stolen from
a safe in the office of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety.
Officers first noticed the money
missing Tuesday afternoon when a
Flicks representative came to claim the
cash to deposit it in the bank, Public
Safety Director Marvin Herrington
told the Daily yesterday.
"We explored all the obvious
mistakes," but could not find the
money in the office, he explained.
"It's an apparent theft."
Herrington said he called in Santa
Clara County Sheriffs deputies to
assist with the investigation, but they
have no leads yet. KZSU News
yesterday first revealed the
disappearance of the money.
Safekeeping
The money was contained in one of
two cash bags that Flicks personnel
turned over to security department
officers for safekeeping Sunday night
after the second screening of Patton,
according to Herrington.
Officers then placed the money in a
safe in the public safety and fire

department common business office
and locked the safe, he said.
The safe, which he described as "an
old safe," is "locked during the night,
but normally unlocked during the
day." The area near the safe is
accessible to the public with business
in the office.
'Inside Job'
Herrington did not rule out the
possibility that the theft was "an
inside job," since there was no
evidence of forced entry into the safe
and"the combination was widely
known."
He said the department will cover
the financial loss to the ASSU, but he
has not checked with the department's
insurance company yet.
Delivering the money to the public
safety department in the first place is
not the ASSU Sunday Flicks "usual
procedure," according to Flicks
manager Bob Sisson.
'Technicality'
But the usual procedure could not
be followed last Sunday because of "a
technicality" caused by the absence of
Jim Holbrook, Flicks box office
manager. Holbrook was vacationing in
Los Angeles.

office manager, delivered the cash to
