# Friendly Asks Media To Find 'Real’ Truth
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Former CBS News President Fred
W. Friendly yesterday called upon the
national news media to give the
American people an overview of the
Watergate scandal and of "how much
of a discrepancy there is between the
Nixon truth and the real truth."

In an interview with Daily and
KZSU News reporters, Friendly said
the three major networks "have done a
very good job on the short term," but
added that "what is lacking is someone
to take all of the President's
statements of what he said the truth
was then and now, Nixon versus Nixon
as it were, and expose that next to the
known record of what the truth is."
Friendly resigned from CBS in
1966 after a dispute with the network
management over providing live
coverage of portions of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hearings
on Vietnam. He is currently Edward
R. Murrow Professor of Journalism at
Columbia University.
Although he believes that Watergate
"is only the symptom of a government
that mistreated its public and didn't
trust the news media at all and a news
media that reacted as only it could to
try to survive," Friendly said he
opposed shielding newsmen from
government pressure.
"The only way you're going to stop
people from managing the news,"
Friendly said, "is by making a big
announcement" of any government
attempts to influence newsmen or the
content of their stories. "Everybody
wants to try to manipulate the news,
but nobody wants you to know that
they're manipulating the news."
Friendly favors expanding network
news programs to an hour each night,
but said that local station managers
opposed the move because their
stations make greater profits from
locally originated news programs.
He said "it's going to take an awful
lot of fighting" to get hour-long
network news programs and added "I
wish some of the people in
broadcasting would fight as hard as
[Edward R.] Murrow did for what
they believe in," including longer news
broadcasts.
Friendly also serves as a public
broadcasting consultant to the Ford

Foundation. He said "We've got to get
a country and a group of politicans
who understand the need for an
independent, non-profit system [of
public broadcasting]. We're quite a
ways away from that."
He suggested that $15 annual
contributions from 10 million
American families would support a
system "independent of Congress,
independent of foundations,
independent of everybody."
According to Friendly, the

commercial "television managements
got very scared" during the Nixon
Administration's attack on the media
"because what Mr. Agnew and the
President had [behind) their veiled
threat and their spiked fist was the
power to license and unlicense
television stations."
Friendly, who is in the Bay Area to
attend a media law conference in San
Francisco, visited two communication
classes before the interview. KZSU will
broadcast the interview in its entirety
next week.

the three major networks "have done a
very good job on the short term," but
added that "what is lacking is someone
to take all of the President's
statements of what he said the truth
was then and now, Nixon versus Nixon
as it were, and expose that next to the
known record of what the truth is."
Friendly resigned from CBS in
1966 after a dispute with the network
management over providing live
coverage of portions of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hearings
on Vietnam. He is currently Edward
R. Murrow Professor of Journalism at
Columbia University.
Although he believes that Watergate
"is only the symptom of a government
that mistreated its public and didn't
trust the news media at all and a news
media that reacted as only it could to
try to survive," Friendly said he
opposed shielding newsmen from
government pressure.
"The only way you're going to stop
people from managing the news,"
Friendly said, "is by making a big
announcement" of any government
attempts to influence newsmen or the
content of their stories. "Everybody
wants to try to manipulate the news,
but nobody wants you to know that
they're manipulating the news."
Friendly favors expanding network
news programs to an hour each night,
but said that local station managers
opposed the move because their
stations make greater profits from
locally originated news programs.
He said "it's going to take an awful
lot of fighting" to get hour-long
network news programs and added "I
wish some of the people in
broadcasting would fight as hard as
[Edward R.] Murrow did for what
they believe in," including longer news
broadcasts.
Friendly also serves as a public
broadcasting consultant to the Ford

Foundation. He said "We've got to get
a country and a group of politicans
who understand the need for an
independent, non-profit system [of
public broadcasting]. We're quite a
ways away from that."
He suggested that $15 annual
contributions from 10 million
American families would support a
system "independent of Congress,
independent of foundations,
independent of everybody."
According to Friendly, the

commercial "television managements
got very scared" during the Nixon
Administration's attack on the media
"because what Mr. Agnew and the
President had [behind) their veiled
threat and their spiked fist was the
power to license and unlicense
television stations."
Friendly, who is in the Bay Area to
attend a media law conference in San
Francisco, visited two communication
classes before the interview. KZSU will
broadcast the interview in its entirety
next week.

FRIENDLY VIEWS - Former CBS News President Fred W. Friendly discussed
Watergate with Daily and KZSU News reporters yesterday. He asked the
American news media to present all of Nixon's statements, past and present, as
well as the known facts about the issue.
Former CBS News President Fred
W. Friendly yesterday called upon the
national news media to give the
American people an overview of the
Watergate scandal and of "how much
of a discrepancy there is between the
Nixon truth and the real truth."
