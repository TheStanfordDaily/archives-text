The Stanford Arena, the five-year-old conservative
campus journal, is apparently moribund.
The publication, which appeared irregularly last year, is
seemingly not in financial trouble. However, the Free
Campus Movement, the conservative organization that
publishes the Arena, has been unable to locate an
acceptable new editor to replace Chris Hocker, who
graduated last year.
The paper existed since its inception primarily on
contributions from alumni. Some previous donors,
including former trustee and former Deputy Defense
Secretary David Packard, say they'd be willing to continue
giving if and when the paper resumes publication.
'Some Support'
Packard, the Palo Alto electronics magnate, told the
Daily last week that he had given the paper "some support
in the past." He confirmed that he meant monetary
support, but declined to specify how much.
The Arena's publication costs ran between $2000 and
$3000 a year, according to two former editors. Another
source said that Packard contributed a "substantial"
portion of those costs.
Packard noted, however, that he had few direct
dealings with the Arena since his return from Washington
two years ago. Asked whether his contributions to the
paper had ever been made public, he responded, "I don't
have the slightly idea — and I really don't care."
(Brien Benson, the Arena's first editor and now
director of publications at the Hoover Institution, said
that the Arena did not disclose the identity of its
contributors "not as any big deal, but just as a matter of
policy.")

Besides financial support, Packard, along with
conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr., also
authored endorsements of the paper to other potential
contributors.
First Contact
Packard said he was first contacted about the Arena in
1968, when he was still a member of the Board of
Trustees. He said he was first contacted by Dr. W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, and that
since then he had dealt primarily with Benson.
Campbell said last week that he had "very, very little
contact" with the Arena. However, he recalled that "when
they were just starting, I may have suggested to a few
people that here was a struggling student newspaper
attempting to present a conservative viewpoint, that was
perhaps worthy of their support."
Benson, while not denying his contact with Packard,
asserted that he has actually had little to do with the
paper over the last few years outside of a "special
interest" since he was its first editor.
However, other sources said Benson has remained
active in contacting potential donors, and Benson himself
confirmed that he had "occasionally" paid Arena bills
with his personal check, later to be reimbursed by the
paper.
'Very Useful'
Hocker said this week that Benson had been "very
useful to the paper'' and had been "active in establishing
financial contacts to help support the Arena." When he
read Benson's statement of non-involvement, however,
Hocker amended his previous remarks: "Well actually,
what Brien said is true. I mean, I'm sure he didn't stay up
at night or sit down at home with a list and say to himself,
'Now, where can we get the money for next issue?' "
Hocker said he "deliberately sort of kept out" of
raising funds for the paper, and said he actually handled
little money. However, he also amended these remarks,
saying instead that most of the money came in the form
of checks mailed directly to the Arena that he handled.
Hocker was wary, as were some others questioned,
about bringing Benson into the story because of his
Hoover connection. "You shouldn't get the idea that
Brien was really putting out the paper or that he was the
real power," Hocker cautioned. He said there were "some
people who would like to cry conflict-of-interest or
something if they saw people at Hoover involved with the
Arena. Hoover did not secretly publish the Arena."
One source privately characterized some Hoover
personnel as being "super-paranoid" about possible
involvement with the publication. Benson said he didn't
know of any persons at Hoover involved with the paper,
but said, "Well, perhaps we may have had some Hoover
money, of course in the sense of coming from individuals
who are within Hoover, not from Hoover itself."
Knew Little
Glenn Garvin, a Daily reporter who edited the Arena
last fall quarter, says that he knew very little about the
paper's funding when he took over.
Garvin said that when he took the job, he asked for
and received Hocker's assurance that "the Nazi Party or

something wasn't involved ... I didn't want to get mixed
up with any of those crazy right-wing groups." Otherwise,
he said, the little he knew about the paper's funding came
through Hocker.
Garvin said that indirect pressure from contributors
was "one reason, although not the major reason" that he
resigned from the paper. Occasionally, he said, Hocker
would advise him not to run certain stories or features
because they would alienate donors. However, he said, he
was never directly pressured by contributors.
Garvin contended that an Arena might be unnecessary
now. "The need for an Arena per se no longer exists," he
said, noting that the Daily "seems to be providing a much
better balance" than in previous years. "I happen to think
that while the Daily can use competition in the sense that
competition makes it a better paper, the idea that the
conservative students on campus need their own paper is
not necessarily a true one."
The issue may be moot right now. As the campus
cooled down over the last two years, much of the impetus
that first led to the Arena's founding seems to have
dissipated. Hocker said this week that "moribund is a
good word to use — the paper may start up again if
somebody really expresses interest and is really willing to
work." However, he conceded, there is no one currently
on the horizon.
