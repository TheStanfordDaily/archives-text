# Wells Fargo In South Africa
## Bank Ignores Social Impact 
### 
(This is the first of a two-part
series. The conclusion will appear
tomorrow on this page.)
How seriously do
decision-makers in a large,
powerful institution consider the
consequences for society of the
policies they adopt? What weight
do they assign the potentially
harmful effects of a decision upon
people who are not in a position
to alter the institution's policies?
An illustration of the way such
questions are too frequently
answered is provided by the Wells
Fargo Bank's recent loan of $2
million to the government of
South Africa. The loan was
arranged through the
European-American Banking
Corporation, which since 1970
has helped to channel over $210
million from a number of
European and American banks to
South African governmental
agencies.
In a rare move, Wells Fargo
specifically requested of the
EABC that its involvement in the
loan program not be publicly
disclosed. Bank officials have now
confirmed the existence of the
loan, and of the non-disclosure
provision, following revelation of
the EABC's activities by the
National Council of Churches'
Corporate Information Center.
The case may be of special
interest to the Stanford
community because of the
multiple links between the
University and Wells Fargo. The
bank's chairman, Mr. Ernest
Arbuckle, is a former Dean of the
Stanford Business School and
currently serves on the Stanford
Boa r d of Trustees; a branch of the
bank, located at Tresidder Union,
handles a large number of student
accounts.
Political Effects
The Wells Fargo loan will
probably increase the South
African government's capacity to
exert police-state control over the
vast majority of the country's
inhabitants, who are barred by
law — solely because of their race
— from having any say in the
government's decisions. The loan
may strengthen, moreover, the
Vorster regime's resolve to remain
unresponsive to economic and
political demands voiced by black
Africans.
When substantial outside
resources flow to South Africa
despite the government's
repressive actions, when
repression itself ensures a safe and
lucrative return on investment,
and when international credits
relieve South Africa's foreign
exchange difficulties, the
government can afford to ignore
many of the domestic forces
pressing for political and social
change. The loan's harmful
consequences will be felt by
people who cannot, for political
as well as geographical reasons,
make their views known in San
Francisco, where Wells Fargo
headquarters are located.
Mr. Arbuckle and other bank
officials indicate that
considerations such as these did
not figure at all in their
calculations. In fact, in a written
response to earlier inquiries about
the loan, Mr. Arbuckle stated that
Wells Fargo follows a "policy of
not including political criteria in
our loan decision process."
Political Considerations
But is it not disingenous for a
bank to pretend to adopt an
apolitical stance when providing
assistance to a foreign
government? As bank officials
granted during our conversation,
several political factors may
actually be considered in

connection with a loan to another
government. First, one must assess
the likelihood of a serious internal
or external challenge to the
regime in question, as this affects
the riskiness of the loan and hence
the terms on which it is offered.
Second, Wells Fargo is
constrained by the policies of the
U.S. government and would not
approve a loan, however,
commercially profitable, to a
regime toward which Washington
was hostile. Third, political
sensitivities of American citizens
must be considered. Expectation
that the bank's image would be
harmed if it became known that
"Wells Fargo delivers" to South
Africa obviously accounts for the
unusual non-disclosure request.
Fourth, a foreign government's
behavior toward its own citizens
may on occasion be taken into
account. Bank officials agreed, for
example, that they would not
approve a loan to the Soviet
Union if the Soviet government
were conducting a program of its
Jewish citizens.
Additional Criteria
If these political criteria are
considered legitimate and may
actually be used to block approval
of an otherwise financially sound
loan, Wells Fargo officials might
consider adoption of still another
guideline: "A loan to a foreign
government should not normally
be approved in those limited cases
where 1) profitability of the loan
is virtually guaranteed by
government regulations, 2)
mechanisms for mass participation
in national politics are unavilable,

David Abernethy

and 3) the loan is likely to expand
the government's capacity to
coerce its citizens without
ensuring a commensurate increase
in the citizen's capacity to present
demands effectively to the
government."
Finding specific cases to which
this guideline applies is, of course,
a difficult and highly subjective
exercise, with regimes on the far
left as well as the far right of the
political spectrum as possible
candidates for coverage. But
surely South Africa is among the
world's prime candidates.
Government regulations ensure
wage discrimination, and prevent
effective unionization of the
African work force, theeby
lowering labor costs and ensuring
a high return on investment.
Participation in national
politics is restricted to whites,
who constitute only 18 percent of
the population.
The history of the last
twenty-five years, during which
spectacular ecnomic development
has been accompanied by
unprecedented political
repression, gives the lie to naive
assumptions about the
democratizing effect of new
investment. The assumption
should rather be reversed for
many of the EABC-arranged
loans, which are made to the
government-controlled Iron and
Steel Corporation at a time when
South Africa is moving towards
self-sufficiency in arms
production.

Second, Wells Fargo is
constrained by the policies of the
U.S. government and would not
approve a loan, however,
commercially profitable, to a
regime toward which Washington
was hostile. Third, political
sensitivities of American citizens
must be considered. Expectation
that the bank's image would be
harmed if it became known that
"Wells Fargo delivers" to South
Africa obviously accounts for the
unusual non-disclosure request.
Fourth, a foreign government's
behavior toward its own citizens
may on occasion be taken into
account. Bank officials agreed, for
example, that they would not
approve a loan to the Soviet
Union if the Soviet government
were conducting a program of its
Jewish citizens.
Additional Criteria
If these political criteria are
considered legitimate and may
actually be used to block approval
of an otherwise financially sound
loan, Wells Fargo officials might
consider adoption of still another
guideline: "A loan to a foreign
government should not normally
be approved in those limited cases
where 1) profitability of the loan
is virtually guaranteed by
government regulations, 2)
mechanisms for mass participation
in national politics are unavilable,

David Abernethy

and 3) the loan is likely to expand
the government's capacity to
coerce its citizens without
ensuring a commensurate increase
in the citizen's capacity to present
demands effectively to the
government."
Finding specific cases to which
this guideline applies is, of course,
a difficult and highly subjective
exercise, with regimes on the far
left as well as the far right of the
political spectrum as possible
candidates for coverage. But
surely South Africa is among the
world's prime candidates.
Government regulations ensure
wage discrimination, and prevent
effective unionization of the
African work force, theeby
lowering labor costs and ensuring
a high return on investment.
Participation in national
politics is restricted to whites,
who constitute only 18 percent of
the population.
The history of the last
twenty-five years, during which
spectacular ecnomic development
has been accompanied by
unprecedented political
repression, gives the lie to naive
assumptions about the
democratizing effect of new
investment. The assumption
should rather be reversed for
many of the EABC-arranged
loans, which are made to the
government-controlled Iron and
Steel Corporation at a time when
South Africa is moving towards
self-sufficiency in arms
production.

How seriously do
decision-makers in a large,
powerful institution consider the
consequences for society of the
policies they adopt? What weight
do they assign the potentially
harmful effects of a decision upon
people who are not in a position
to alter the institution's policies?
An illustration of the way such
questions are too frequently
answered is provided by the Wells
Fargo Bank's recent loan of $2
million to the government of
South Africa. The loan was
arranged through the
European-American Banking
Corporation, which since 1970
has helped to channel over $210
million from a number of
European and American banks to
South African governmental
agencies.
In a rare move, Wells Fargo
specifically requested of the
EABC that its involvement in the
loan program not be publicly
disclosed. Bank officials have now
confirmed the existence of the
loan, and of the non-disclosure
provision, following revelation of
the EABC's activities by the
National Council of Churches'
Corporate Information Center.
The case may be of special
interest to the Stanford
community because of the
multiple links between the
University and Wells Fargo. The
bank's chairman, Mr. Ernest
Arbuckle, is a former Dean of the
Stanford Business School and
currently serves on the Stanford
Boa r d of Trustees; a branch of the
bank, located at Tresidder Union,
handles a large number of student
accounts.
Political Effects
The Wells Fargo loan will
probably increase the South
African government's capacity to
exert police-state control over the
vast majority of the country's
inhabitants, who are barred by
law — solely because of their race
— from having any say in the
government's decisions. The loan
may strengthen, moreover, the
Vorster regime's resolve to remain
unresponsive to economic and
political demands voiced by black
Africans.
When substantial outside
resources flow to South Africa
despite the government's
repressive actions, when
repression itself ensures a safe and
lucrative return on investment,
and when international credits
relieve South Africa's foreign
exchange difficulties, the
government can afford to ignore
many of the domestic forces
pressing for political and social
change. The loan's harmful
consequences will be felt by
people who cannot, for political
as well as geographical reasons,
make their views known in San
Francisco, where Wells Fargo
headquarters are located.
Mr. Arbuckle and other bank
officials indicate that
considerations such as these did
not figure at all in their
calculations. In fact, in a written
response to earlier inquiries about
the loan, Mr. Arbuckle stated that
Wells Fargo follows a "policy of
not including political criteria in
our loan decision process."
Political Considerations
But is it not disingenous for a
bank to pretend to adopt an
apolitical stance when providing
assistance to a foreign
government? As bank officials
granted during our conversation,
several political factors may
actually be considered in

connection with a loan to another
government. First, one must assess
the likelihood of a serious internal
or external challenge to the
regime in question, as this affects
the riskiness of the loan and hence
the terms on which it is offered.
Second, Wells Fargo is
constrained by the policies of the
U.S. government and would not
approve a loan, however,
commercially profitable, to a

EABC that its involvement in the
loan program not be publicly
disclosed. Bank officials have now
confirmed the existence of the
loan, and of the non-disclosure
provision, following revelation of
the EABC's activities by the
National Council of Churches'
Corporate Information Center.
The case may be of special
interest to the Stanford
community because of the
multiple links between the
University and Wells Fargo. The
bank's chairman, Mr. Ernest
Arbuckle, is a former Dean of the
Stanford Business School and
currently serves on the Stanford
Boa r d of Trustees; a branch of the
bank, located at Tresidder Union,
handles a large number of student
accounts.
Political Effects
The Wells Fargo loan will
probably increase the South
African government's capacity to
exert police-state control over the
vast majority of the country's
inhabitants, who are barred by
law — solely because of their race
— from having any say in the
government's decisions. The loan
may strengthen, moreover, the
Vorster regime's resolve to remain
unresponsive to economic and
political demands voiced by black
Africans.
When substantial outside
resources flow to South Africa
despite the government's
repressive actions, when
repression itself ensures a safe and
lucrative return on investment,
and when international credits
relieve South Africa's foreign
exchange difficulties, the
government can afford to ignore
many of the domestic forces
pressing for political and social
change. The loan's harmful
consequences will be felt by
people who cannot, for political
as well as geographical reasons,
make their views known in San
Francisco, where Wells Fargo
headquarters are located.
Mr. Arbuckle and other bank
officials indicate that
considerations such as these did
not figure at all in their
calculations. In fact, in a written
response to earlier inquiries about
the loan, Mr. Arbuckle stated that
Wells Fargo follows a "policy of
not including political criteria in
our loan decision process."
Political Considerations
But is it not disingenous for a
bank to pretend to adopt an
apolitical stance when providing
assistance to a foreign
government? As bank officials
granted during our conversation,
several political factors may
actually be considered in

connection with a loan to another
government. First, one must assess
the likelihood of a serious internal
or external challenge to the
regime in question, as this affects
the riskiness of the loan and hence
the terms on which it is offered.
Second, Wells Fargo is
constrained by the policies of the
U.S. government and would not
approve a loan, however,
commercially profitable, to a
regime toward which Washington
was hostile. Third, political
sensitivities of American citizens
must be considered. Expectation
that the bank's image would be
harmed if it became known that
"Wells Fargo delivers" to South
Africa obviously accounts for the
unusual non-disclosure request.
Fourth, a foreign government's
behavior toward its own citizens
may on occasion be taken into
account. Bank officials agreed, for
example, that they would not
approve a loan to the Soviet
Union if the Soviet government
were conducting a program of its
Jewish citizens.
Additional Criteria
If these political criteria are
considered legitimate and may
actually be used to block approval
of an otherwise financially sound
loan, Wells Fargo officials might
consider adoption of still another
guideline: "A loan to a foreign
government should not normally
be approved in those limited cases
where 1) profitability of the loan
is virtually guaranteed by
government regulations, 2)
mechanisms for mass participation
in national politics are unavilable,

David Abernethy

and 3) the loan is likely to expand
the government's capacity to
coerce its citizens without
ensuring a commensurate increase
in the citizen's capacity to present
demands effectively to the
government."
Finding specific cases to which
this guideline applies is, of course,
a difficult and highly subjective
exercise, with regimes on the far
left as well as the far right of the
political spectrum as possible
candidates for coverage. But
surely South Africa is among the
world's prime candidates.
Government regulations ensure
wage discrimination, and prevent
effective unionization of the
African work force, theeby
lowering labor costs and ensuring
a high return on investment.
Participation in national
politics is restricted to whites,
who constitute only 18 percent of
the population.
The history of the last
twenty-five years, during which
spectacular ecnomic development
has been accompanied by
unprecedented political
repression, gives the lie to naive
assumptions about the
democratizing effect of new
investment. The assumption
should rather be reversed for
many of the EABC-arranged
loans, which are made to the
government-controlled Iron and
Steel Corporation at a time when
South Africa is moving towards
self-sufficiency in arms
production.

How seriously do
decision-makers in a large,
powerful institution consider the
consequences for society of the
policies they adopt? What weight
do they assign the potentially
harmful effects of a decision upon
people who are not in a position
to alter the institution's policies?
An illustration of the way such
questions are too frequently
answered is provided by the Wells
Fargo Bank's recent loan of $2
million to the government of
South Africa. The loan was
arranged through the
European-American Banking
Corporation, which since 1970
has helped to channel over $210
million from a number of
European and American banks to
South African governmental
agencies.
