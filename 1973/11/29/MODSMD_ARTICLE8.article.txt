## Politicians Create Oil Crisis 
### 
In discussing the energy crisis,
it is first necessary to ascertain
whether the crisis is a natural
consequence of the available
amount of oil or whether it is the
artificial product of political
developments.
Without a doubt what is called
the energy crisis is actually a
political crisis. There is no acute
long-run energy shortage, but
rather trouble stemming from
political policies that control fuel
resources.
MIT economist M.A. Adelman
has gathered and analyzed the
empirical evidence on demand for
oil. It shows that demand has not
accelerated significantly in recent
years. He notes that new
discoveries and potential
production are not falling behind
consumption. There has been no
"surge in demand" against supply
constraints.
Historically, the energy
industries, especially the
petroleum industry, have been
heavily politicized. Production in
domestic oil fields is prorationed
and regulated by state agencies
like the Texas Railroad
Commission in a way that ensures
monopoly profits. Import quotas
have, under government
supervision, shored up the
domestic stabilization system and
protected established shares of the
market.
There are 61 petroleum
industry lobbying offices in
Washington, D.C. Earlier this year,
Phillips Petroleum, Gulf Oil, and
Ashland Oil admitted making
illegal payments of $10,000 each
to Richard Nixon's 1972
campaign. Payments also went to
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of
Washington and Rep. Wilbur D.

Mills of Arkansas.
Adelman's new economic
study, World Petroleum Market,
describes the interests at stake:
"The United States has an
obvious interest in high crude oil
prices. It supports a high-cost
domestic oil industry, and the
lower the world price becomes the
more difficult it is to resist a flood
of imports, or to justify the
protection against it.
"When the 'Kennedy Round'
negotiations for lower tariffs were
begun in 1962, President Kennedy
made a prior agreement with
Senator [Robert S.] Kerr that oil
imports would be excluded.
"Moreover, the United States is
a very large net seller, because
most of the crude oil sold to the
world market is produced by
American companies. Its real gain
and foreign exchange gain is
therefore large."
For heterogeneous reasons, the
other major oil-consuming
countries also favor high crude
prices. Thus, at present the world
is faced with inter-governmental
cooperation in supporting the
continued existence of a cartel of
oil-exporting countries (the
Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) and a
coordinate cartel of the oil
companies. Hence we see
monopolies cutting back
production and raising prices in
oil.
The oil companies' cartel uses
the tax hikes of oil-exporting
countries' cartel as the occasion
for monopolistic price hikes by a
united front of the companies.
For example, in Great Britain
there was a price rise of 42 cents
per barrel following the February
1971 Tehran-Tripoli Agreements
tax increase 6f 28 cents.
Because all private cartel
arrangements are inherently
unstable, the oil companies could
not maintain their united front
without having the governments
involved serve in various ways to
police the cartel arrangement.
Confronted now with a
short-run artificial oil shortage
that is the result of energy policies
sanctioned or deviced by the U.S.
government, political
decision-makers are choosing
between a massive tax hike and
direct rationing in an attempt to
allocate fuel supplies. It's like
giving the American public a
choice between death by hanging
or firing squad.
The Nixon administration
plans to utilize 250 oil industry
executives to run its energy crisis
programs. These men were
supposed to be made the key
officials in the Emergency
Pet roleum and Gas
Administration, an agency
designed to control the industry
from top to bottom in conditions
like wartime. The organizational
structure is reminiscent of the War
Industries Board in World War I or
of the corporative syndics of
Mussolini's Italy.
Instead of more

government-created crises; instead
of protectionism; instead of
subsidies to coal, to oil, and to
energy research; instead of higher
tax burdens; instead of rationing
(and black markets); instead of
increased despotism following
energy use into every human
activity — instead of all this — the
government should get out of the
energy field. The government
should let the people alone.

years. He notes that new
discoveries and potential
production are not falling behind
consumption. There has been no
"surge in demand" against supply
constraints.
Historically, the energy
industries, especially the
petroleum industry, have been
heavily politicized. Production in
domestic oil fields is prorationed
and regulated by state agencies
like the Texas Railroad
Commission in a way that ensures
monopoly profits. Import quotas
have, under government
supervision, shored up the
domestic stabilization system and
protected established shares of the

There are 61 petroleum
industry lobbying offices in

Adelman's new economic
study, World Petroleum Market,
describes the interests at stake:
"The United States has an
obvious interest in high crude oil
prices. It supports a high-cost
domestic oil industry, and the
lower the world price becomes the
more difficult it is to resist a flood
of imports, or to justify the
protection against it.
"When the 'Kennedy Round'
negotiations for lower tariffs were
begun in 1962, President Kennedy
made a prior agreement with
Senator [Robert S.] Kerr that oil
imports would be excluded.
"Moreover, the United States is
a very large net seller, because
most of the crude oil sold to the
world market is produced by
American companies. Its real gain
and foreign exchange gain is
therefore large."
For heterogeneous reasons, the
other major oil-consuming
countries also favor high crude
prices. Thus, at present the world
is faced with inter-governmental
cooperation in supporting the
continued existence of a cartel of
oil-exporting countries (the
Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) and a
coordinate cartel of the oil
companies. Hence we see
monopolies cutting back
production and raising prices in
oil.
The oil companies' cartel uses
the tax hikes of oil-exporting
countries' cartel as the occasion
for monopolistic price hikes by a
united front of the companies.
For example, in Great Britain
there was a price rise of 42 cents
per barrel following the February
1971 Tehran-Tripoli Agreements
tax increase 6f 28 cents.
Because all private cartel
arrangements are inherently
unstable, the oil companies could
not maintain their united front
without having the governments
involved serve in various ways to
police the cartel arrangement.
Confronted now with a
short-run artificial oil shortage
that is the result of energy policies
sanctioned or deviced by the U.S.
government, political
decision-makers are choosing
between a massive tax hike and
direct rationing in an attempt to
allocate fuel supplies. It's like
giving the American public a
choice between death by hanging
or firing squad.
The Nixon administration
plans to utilize 250 oil industry
executives to run its energy crisis
programs. These men were
supposed to be made the key
officials in the Emergency
Pet roleum and Gas
Administration, an agency
designed to control the industry
from top to bottom in conditions
like wartime. The organizational
structure is reminiscent of the War
Industries Board in World War I or
of the corporative syndics of
Mussolini's Italy.
