# Future Is Now For Talented Cards
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The similarities are striking.
Stanford's 1972-73 basketball
team won four of its last five
games — the only loss coming
when a seven-point halftime lead
gradually disappeared at UCLA's
awe-inspring Pauley Pavilion.
Stanford's 1973 football team
won five of its last six contests —
the only loss coming when a now
infamous Indonesian placekicker
booted away the Cardinal upset
hopes with just three seconds
remaining on the Los Angeles
Coliseum clock.
For football coach Jack
Christiansen, it will be a long eight
months before his promising 1974
squad takes the field on Sept. 14
at Penn State.
But the future is now for
Howie Dallmar and his basketball
Cardinals, who open their
1973-74 season Friday night
against Nevada-Reno and face
USF Monday night. Both games
begin at 8 p.m. here at Maples
Pavilion.
Last year Stanford was 14-11
— the Cards' first winning record
in six years. And with almost
everyone back from that team,
Dallmar says "we've got to be
better" this year. "It's much
easier for us to progress," he said.
"Everyone is familiar with the
system now — we're a lot more
polished."
Super Center
Particularly . polished is
seven-foot junior center Rich
Kelley, who, in basketball
coaches' jargon, was inconsistent
at the start of last season,
semi-super toward the end of the
campaign and should be simply
superlative this season.
Last year Kelley averaged 17.3
points and snared a school record
— 331 rebounds (13.2 per game).
He shot over 50 percent from the
floor, over 70 percent from the
free throw line and was a first
team All-Conference selection. His
only weakness was an occasional
tendency to batter the bleachers
with errant passes.
This year, though, after a
summer playing for a United
States All-Star team in Red China,
Kelley should be a steadying
influence. "It's very difficult to
restrain yourself when you think
of how good he might be,"
Dallmar said. "I know one thing,
his presence makes everyone else
play a little bit better."
"Everyone else" includes eight
returning lettermen, one returning
non-letterman, two players from
last year's junior varsity and two
red shirts.
Starting Guards
Junior Melvin Arterberry
(B-3V4), a smooth ballhandler who
makes up for a shooting
deficiency with excellent
quickness and defensive ability,
will start at one guard spot —
actually a wing position in

Stanford's double-post offense.
The other guard, playing the point
position, will be senior Jim
Montague, a 6-1 performer who
played sparingly last season but
earned a starting job in early fall
practices with his "smart, heady
play" and outside shooting
ability.
The wing spot opposite
Arterberry will be occupied by
junior Scott Trobbe, a 6-6 leaper
who has the quickness to play
either guard or forward
defensively. Dallmar lists Mike
Mann (6-9) as the tentative starter
alongside Kelley in the post.
Starting lineups, however, may
be totally irrelevant. Dave Frost
(6-6), Mark Gilberg (6-0), Tim
Patterson (6-11) and Ed
Schweitzer (6-BV£) will all see
considerable action, and Mike
Simons, Ben Bluitt, Archie Dean
and Rich Wohlstadter may come
off the bench in certain situations.
Flexibility
"We have a tremendous
amount of flexibility," Dallmar
said, pointing to the possibility of
playing three big men at once
(Kelley and Mann in the posts
with Patterson at one wing spot)
or starting three smaller guards
(Montague, Arterberry and
Gilberg).
"Well shift our lineup

depending on the situation,"
Dallmar said, so fans at this
weekend's games may see a
myriad of combinations.
It all adds up to a tremendous
amount of height, talent and
versatility for Stanford — and
maybe the Cards' best season
since Dallmar's 1962 squad
finished with a 20-6 record.
There are, however, two major
question marks. Mann, who
underwent knee surgery less than
two months ago, may have
trouble regaining the form which
made him a two-year starter. And
Frost, who has been plagued by
recurring back problems
throughout his Stanford career,
now also has to contend with
cartilage damage in his right knee.
Both Mann and Frost are
proven performers, but their
1973-74 effectiveness is still in
doubt.
The players, though, remain
hopeful. "We'll win at least 20
games," was a statement echoed
by Kelley and Patterson. And
Schweitzer, displaying the brash
confidence so often characteristic
of young players who have never
stepped onto the floor against
UCLA, said that Stanford "has a
good chance" to beat the Bruins.
But first there's Nevada-Reno
and then USF — and then maybe
a wondrous winter.

He shot over 50 percent from the
floor, over 70 percent from the
free throw line and was a first
team All-Conference selection. His
only weakness was an occasional
tendency to batter the bleachers
with errant passes.
This year, though, after a
summer playing for a United
States All-Star team in Red China,
Kelley should be a steadying
influence. "It's very difficult to
restrain yourself when you think
of how good he might be,"
Dallmar said. "I know one thing,
his presence makes everyone else
play a little bit better."
"Everyone else" includes eight
returning lettermen, one returning
non-letterman, two players from
last year's junior varsity and two
red shirts.
Starting Guards
Junior Melvin Arterberry
(B-3V4), a smooth ballhandler who
makes up for a shooting
deficiency with excellent
quickness and defensive ability,
will start at one guard spot —
actually a wing position in

Stanford's double-post offense.
The other guard, playing the point
position, will be senior Jim
Montague, a 6-1 performer who
played sparingly last season but
earned a starting job in early fall
practices with his "smart, heady
play" and outside shooting
ability.
The wing spot opposite
Arterberry will be occupied by
junior Scott Trobbe, a 6-6 leaper
who has the quickness to play
either guard or forward
defensively. Dallmar lists Mike
Mann (6-9) as the tentative starter
alongside Kelley in the post.
Starting lineups, however, may
be totally irrelevant. Dave Frost
(6-6), Mark Gilberg (6-0), Tim
Patterson (6-11) and Ed
Schweitzer (6-BV£) will all see
considerable action, and Mike
Simons, Ben Bluitt, Archie Dean
and Rich Wohlstadter may come
off the bench in certain situations.
Flexibility
"We have a tremendous
amount of flexibility," Dallmar
said, pointing to the possibility of
playing three big men at once
(Kelley and Mann in the posts
with Patterson at one wing spot)
or starting three smaller guards
(Montague, Arterberry and
Gilberg).
"Well shift our lineup

depending on the situation,"
Dallmar said, so fans at this
weekend's games may see a
myriad of combinations.
It all adds up to a tremendous
amount of height, talent and
versatility for Stanford — and
maybe the Cards' best season
since Dallmar's 1962 squad
finished with a 20-6 record.
There are, however, two major
question marks. Mann, who
underwent knee surgery less than
two months ago, may have
trouble regaining the form which
made him a two-year starter. And
Frost, who has been plagued by
recurring back problems
throughout his Stanford career,
now also has to contend with
cartilage damage in his right knee.
Both Mann and Frost are
proven performers, but their
1973-74 effectiveness is still in
doubt.
The players, though, remain
hopeful. "We'll win at least 20
games," was a statement echoed
by Kelley and Patterson. And
Schweitzer, displaying the brash
confidence so often characteristic
of young players who have never
stepped onto the floor against
UCLA, said that Stanford "has a
good chance" to beat the Bruins.
But first there's Nevada-Reno
and then USF — and then maybe
a wondrous winter.

ONE OF THE WINNINGEST—Head coach Howie Dallmar, who

games — the only loss coming

Patterson (6-11) and Ed
Schweitzer (6-BV£) will all see
considerable action, and Mike
Simons, Ben Bluitt, Archie Dean
and Rich Wohlstadter may come
off the bench in certain situations.
Flexibility
"We have a tremendous
amount of flexibility," Dallmar
said, pointing to the possibility of
playing three big men at once
(Kelley and Mann in the posts
with Patterson at one wing spot)
or starting three smaller guards
(Montague, Arterberry and
Gilberg).
"Well shift our lineup

depending on the situation,"
Dallmar said, so fans at this
weekend's games may see a
myriad of combinations.
It all adds up to a tremendous
amount of height, talent and
versatility for Stanford — and
maybe the Cards' best season
since Dallmar's 1962 squad
finished with a 20-6 record.
There are, however, two major
question marks. Mann, who
underwent knee surgery less than
two months ago, may have
trouble regaining the form which
made him a two-year starter. And
Frost, who has been plagued by
recurring back problems
throughout his Stanford career,
now also has to contend with
cartilage damage in his right knee.
Both Mann and Frost are
proven performers, but their
1973-74 effectiveness is still in
doubt.
The players, though, remain
hopeful. "We'll win at least 20
games," was a statement echoed
by Kelley and Patterson. And
Schweitzer, displaying the brash
confidence so often characteristic
of young players who have never
stepped onto the floor against
UCLA, said that Stanford "has a
good chance" to beat the Bruins.
But first there's Nevada-Reno
and then USF — and then maybe
a wondrous winter.

ONE OF THE WINNINGEST—Head coach Howie Dallmar, who
begins his 20th season at Stanford this weekend, currently ranks
among the nation's top 20 basketball coaches with a career record of
340-287. Dallmar also played for Stanford, leading the Cards to the
1942 NCAA title.
The similarities are striking.
Stanford's 1972-73 basketball
team won four of its last five
games — the only loss coming
when a seven-point halftime lead
gradually disappeared at UCLA's
awe-inspring Pauley Pavilion.
Stanford's 1973 football team
won five of its last six contests —
the only loss coming when a now
infamous Indonesian placekicker
booted away the Cardinal upset
hopes with just three seconds
remaining on the Los Angeles
Coliseum clock.
For football coach Jack
Christiansen, it will be a long eight
months before his promising 1974
squad takes the field on Sept. 14
at Penn State.
But the future is now for
Howie Dallmar and his basketball
Cardinals, who open their
1973-74 season Friday night
against Nevada-Reno and face
USF Monday night. Both games
begin at 8 p.m. here at Maples
Pavilion.
Last year Stanford was 14-11
— the Cards' first winning record
in six years. And with almost
everyone back from that team,
Dallmar says "we've got to be
better" this year. "It's much
easier for us to progress," he said.
"Everyone is familiar with the
system now — we're a lot more
polished."
Super Center
Particularly . polished is
seven-foot junior center Rich
Kelley, who, in basketball
coaches' jargon, was inconsistent
at the start of last season,
semi-super toward the end of the
campaign and should be simply
superlative this season.
Last year Kelley averaged 17.3
points and snared a school record
— 331 rebounds (13.2 per game).
He shot over 50 percent from the
floor, over 70 percent from the
free throw line and was a first
team All-Conference selection. His
only weakness was an occasional
tendency to batter the bleachers
with errant passes.
This year, though, after a
summer playing for a United
States All-Star team in Red China,
Kelley should be a steadying
influence. "It's very difficult to
restrain yourself when you think
of how good he might be,"
Dallmar said. "I know one thing,
his presence makes everyone else
play a little bit better."
"Everyone else" includes eight
returning lettermen, one returning
non-letterman, two players from
last year's junior varsity and two
red shirts.
Starting Guards
Junior Melvin Arterberry
(B-3V4), a smooth ballhandler who
makes up for a shooting
deficiency with excellent
quickness and defensive ability,
will start at one guard spot —
actually a wing position in

Stanford's double-post offense.
The other guard, playing the point
position, will be senior Jim
Montague, a 6-1 performer who
played sparingly last season but
earned a starting job in early fall
practices with his "smart, heady
play" and outside shooting
ability.
The wing spot opposite
Arterberry will be occupied by
junior Scott Trobbe, a 6-6 leaper
who has the quickness to play
either guard or forward
defensively. Dallmar lists Mike
Mann (6-9) as the tentative starter
alongside Kelley in the post.
Starting lineups, however, may
be totally irrelevant. Dave Frost
(6-6), Mark Gilberg (6-0), Tim
Patterson (6-11) and Ed
Schweitzer (6-BV£) will all see
considerable action, and Mike
Simons, Ben Bluitt, Archie Dean
and Rich Wohlstadter may come
off the bench in certain situations.
