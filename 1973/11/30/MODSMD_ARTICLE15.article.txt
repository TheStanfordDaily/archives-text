# Bowling Keeps Up With The Joneses
## 
### STAN WILSON 
The anxious fan plumbs his
pocket for his ticket, presents it
quickly to the man at the gate,
and stumbles into the
already overpopulated Maples
Pavilion.
He checks his watch — 7:57 —
and realizes he has only three
minutes before the national
champion UCLA Bruins take the
floor against Stanford.
Suddenly two tall, thin young
men stroll conspicuously onto the
court. One is clad in a maroon
suede coat, purple plaid flares and
shiny black boots. Not to be
outdone, the other is bedecked in
a navy blue, double-breasted sport
coat, a light blue lambswool turtle
neck sweater, and to top it off, he
is accompanied by his
identically-enrobed son, who is no
bigger than the basketball he's
trying to dribble. ♦
The fan double-checks his
ticket, afraid he's mistakenly
stumbled into a men's fashion
show. He needn't worry, though.
The two would-be models are
really Stanford's young assistant
basketball coaches, the
best-dressed pair on the West
coast — a dynamic duo whose
impressive wardrobes make the
costuming in Camelot look like a
high school play.
Bowling got one up on the
Joneses last season when Daily
fashion editor Nancy Ditz selected
him the season's best-dressed
coach by a narrow margin. This
I season, the competition promises
to be furious.
'Stop At No End'
"Bowling would stop at no end
to win that competition," says
Jones, tightening his Haggar knit
slacks and obviously still shaken
from his loss to Bowling a year
ago. He mutters something
likening Bowlings' waidrobe to a
Salvation Army clothing display
and walks off, head in hands.
"Jones has done everything
unethically," retorts Bowling in a
prepared statement. "He has been
completely unscrupulous. He has
resorted to flashy undergarments
and brought his child dressed in
matching attire in hopes of
breaking a tie. I will never use my
family to this advantage,"
Bowling explains, carefully
brushing his wavy brown hair into
place.
But Bub, a self-proclaimed

"night-person" who usually looks
like a million bucks by noon, isn't
worth two cents early in the
morning, if we're to believe star
center Rich Kelley. "It can cost
you three years off your life to be
awakened by Bub on a road trip,"
Kelley explains. "His face is
ashen, his skin is dry, his hair is
messed up and his breath is
horrible," Kelley says.
Recruiting and Scouting
But a coach's life isn't all
bright-colored ties and electric
socks. When they're not shopping
at Bullock's or Wilson's House of
Suede and Leather, the dapper
duo traverses the continent
scouting the opposition or
recruiting promising prep athletes.
Head Coach Howie Dallmar's two
ebullient assistants are respected
by the players — always quick to
criticize, but just as quick to
compliment a good pass or fine
defensive play.
"Bub and Billy are the hustle
guys," says Kelley. "They coach
with intensity. Howie's the
mellow strategist."
Jones' role as a coach is doubly
hard. Not only does he help with
the varsity practices, he must
coach the Cards' junior varsity
cage team, a job which was made
difficult with an unfortunate
recruiting year last season.
Paid the Price
"We paid the price this year,"
Jones say, explaining that
Stanford recruited only the top
prep cagers last year, all of whom
went to other schools.
"It's a joke if you think you
can beat the Bruins with second
rate players," he adds, pointing
out that Stanford only went after
five top players.
Not only do Bowling and Jones
go after only the top players,
those athletes have to be good
students as well.
"We do a very thorough job of
finding good basketball players
with good grades," says Bowling.
"It's getting the super player
that's tough," he says, explaining
how stars like Bill Walton and
Ketih Wilkes always seem to end
up at UCLA, a self-perpetuating
dynasty*
One of those stars who didn't
end up at UCLA was Bowling
himself, who played at Stanford
under Dallmar and served as
captain his senior ye?.r. But
Bowling, who was known as an

outstanding playmaker, was no
Jerry West when it came to
shooting.
In fact, one coach kidded him
for being "the worst shooting
guard ever to play at Stanford,"
an accusation which enraged
Bowling until he realized he
couldn't thmk of anybody worse.
And after watching Bowling
get demolished by head manager
Mark Florant in a one-on-one
game earlier this week, Jones
couldn't agree more. Clothes may
make the man, but if the two
amiable assistants ever extend
their dressing room competition
to the basketball court, put your
money on the man who's only
number two.

THE JONESES—Assistant basketball coach Billy Jones and smiling
son Damian enjoy the scenery at Stanford's basketball Press Day last
month. The elder Jones has set three personal goals for this season —
helping the varsity win 20 games, coaching the JV's to a winning mark
and defeating assistant coach Bub Bowling in the second annual
dressing contest.

STANFORD'S STUD-"How do
you spell your name?" asked
Stanford sports information
director Bob Murphy. "S-T-U-D,"
answered assistant basketball
coach Bub Bowling, whose sense
of humor, wardrobe and coaching
ability contribute immeasurably
to Stanford's basketball program.
