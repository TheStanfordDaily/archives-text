# Scrappy JVs Hope Walk-Ons Can Win
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Unless appearances are
deceiving, the season which begins
Friday night for Stanford's junior
varsity basketballers could be a
long one, indeed.
Off-season recruiting yielded
no new prospects for the Cardinal
cage program, so the
freshman-laden JV which opens
this weekend with San Francisco
City College and Gavilan College
will have to rely largely on
unrecruited "walk-ons" for any
hoop heroics.
San Francisco City, according
to Stanford JV coach Billy Jones,
"usually has a good team — very
patient, very organized," while
Gavilan is "a good athletic
school," and therefore should be
tough also, the coach forecasts.
In any case, Jones says, "We're
gonna face people with better
personnel each game — we'll be
outmanned -every time we go to
center court."
Leading the personnel Stanford
does have is 6-8 freshman center
Scott Russell from Campbell,
whom Jones says was recruited by
schools smaller than Stanford.
Also listed at a post position,
although Jones plans more of a
four-guard offense, is sophomore
Bob Brain, a 6-2,170-pounder.
At the starting wing spots will
be 6-1 freshman Mike Bowen
from Mission Viejo, 6-1 Ken
Jurgensen from Pasadena, also a
freshman and 6-0V&, 155-pound
Terry McCartin, a frosh from
Rockville, Md. whom Jones lists
as his best shooter.
Just down from the varsity and
not yet acclimated to the point
where they might start are 6-3,
183-pound Marty Moroski, a
sophomore who played JV last
season, and Tom Sever, r 6-1
junior transfer from Skyline JC.
Jones characterizes his team as

a "small, scrappy, very aggressive"
squad that practices "organized
chaos" on the court. The
backcourt press and fast break are
to be his major weapons this
season, Jones says.
Quite unlike his first team last
year which had players of heights
6-11, 6-9 and 6-5 and finished
with a 12-8 record, Jones says his
1973-74 edition averages at the
six-foot mark.
"We're hurting in rebounding,"
Jones says, "but overall guard
play is better than last year."
Jones expects his team to
"work like hell" in this weekend's
outings to attempt to "get the
good shot." He views the troubles
Stanford will face on the court
this season in a philosophical vein:
"Every time it'll be a new
experience."
