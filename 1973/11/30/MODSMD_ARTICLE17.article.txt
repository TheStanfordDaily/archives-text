# Pac-8 Teams Face Non-League Tests
## 
### 
All basketball tams in the
Pacific Eight conference, which
last year earned the nickname of
the "Pac One Plus Seven," begin
play Friday or Saturday night.
To begin with, the One —
UCLA, winner of nine of the last
10 NCAA championships — hosts
Arkansas Friday and Maryland
Saturday.
The Razorbacks are
undoubtedly doomed to slaughter
at the hands of the Bruins, who
have bloodied 75 straight
opponents. Arkansas has lost its
only real threat, guard Marvin
Terry, last year's Most Valuable
Player in the Southwest
Conference.
Maryland, ranked fourth in the
Associated Press preseason poll,
will be a much tougher challenge.
6-11 Tom McMillen is a top scorer
and rebounder who could
challenge Bill Walton's
domination of the lane. And 6-4
guard Tom Lucas, the Terps'
playmaker as well as their tennis
star, knows how to find the net.
While Pauley Pavilion is filled
Saturday, crosstown rival USC
will play at home, most likely
before empty seats, against
Arizona. The Wildcats finished
16-10 last season while starting
three freshmen, and should
provide a tough test for the

Trojans.
Sophomores Coniel Norman
(6-5), Eric Money (6-2) and A 1
Fleming (6-8) are the main
reasons Arizona is listed ninth
nationally in Sports Illustrated's
preseason rankings.
Dick Harter's Oregon club,
which last year led the Pac-8 in
fouls, tackles and unpopularity
with rival coaches, fights U. of
Americas Friday and Montana
State, picked for last place in the
Big Sky conference, Saturday.
The Ducks' non-league schedule is
considered very good — for
building up the number of wins
Oregon gets this year.
Oregon State opens at home
against U. of Americas Saturday,
and then travels to New Mexico,
as the only other Pac-8 team
besides Stanford playing on
Monday.
The Lobos, 21-6 last year,
should be favored.
Washington hosts Montana
State Friday, but should have
more problems on Saturday. The
Huskies face Wichita State's
Shockers, who have an
electrifying guard in 6-0 Rudy
Jackson.
Washington State hosts
Louisiana State, a young, hustling
team. Saturday night. The
Cougars are another team that will
rely heavily on freshman
prospects.
Finally, the only test California
gets this weekend is Friday against
a team from New South Wales,
Australia. The Bears lack a good,
tall center, and could be in
trouble if their opponents bring a
kangaroo along.
