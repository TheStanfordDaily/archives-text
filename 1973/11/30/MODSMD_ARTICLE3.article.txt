# 'Belter' Than Last Year
## Dons Seek Top Honors 
### MARK WHITE 
One year ago Stanford and USF opened their
basketball seasons with a game in San Francisco that
could have been described as a sacrificial baptism
for a newborn team. Starting one senior, a junior
and three sophomores in their first varsity contest,
embryonic Cardinals were slayed by a veteran USF
team destined to post a 23-5 record, win the
WCAC title and rank among the nation's top 20
teams.
"Snake" Jones and Mike Quick, the two seniors
who last year led the Dons to an 83-68 victory over
the error-prone Cards, have both graduated. But this
has not dulled the Dons' chances for 1973. In fact
several national sports publications, one of which
ranked USF seventh in the country, feel this year's
team will be improved over the successful 1973
squad. Thus the Don's should be favored over the
Cards in Monday's rematch.
Although he insists upon minimizing the
pre-season polls, USF coach Bob Gaillard agrees in
principle with the adjective "better" which has been
applied to this year's USF .squad. "It's hard to tell
what we'll be like this year; we're stronger because
of experience, and maturity has improved us
somewhat. Phil Smith, Kevin Restani and John Boro
have been through two successful [conference] title
races. Eric Fernsten was initiated last year and our
freshmen and sophomores all have had winning
backgrounds.
"But right now I don't know what's going to
happen. We've been inconsistent in practice and I
expect our starting lineup will vary from opponent
to opponent. I don't take our top 10 ranking too
seriously — polls are ridiculous, anyway."
Uncertainty
Evidently Gaillard's uncertainty is grounded in
the absence of "Snake" Jones, whose brilliance in
some games was matched only by his mediocrityin
others, and the prolific scoring of guard Quick.
Presently Boro, a senior guard whom Gaillard
describes as "a fine outside shooter," is slated to fill
Quick's position as ball handler. However Tony
Styles, a JC transfer from lowa Central CC who
averaged 26 points a game there, may overtake Boro
as a starter.
Johnson and Howard Smith, sophomore high
school teammates from Los Angeles, are expected
to fill the "Snake" void. Both are considered

outstanding prospects and the husky 6-9 Smith,
who suffered a broken wrist last year, should
complement the speedy, 6-5 Johnson.
The other Smith on the team, senior 6-4 guard
Phil Smith, is considered among the best in the
country. "He will certainly be drafted in the first
round by the NBA," said Gaillard. Smith, described
by Sports Illustrated as "sinewy, deadpan, unselfish
and still unnoticed," averaged 18.7 points per game
as a junior. "Since we have lost some firepower, I
may have to score a few more points this year," said
Phil.
First Round Draft Picks
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar recently said,
"USF is an excellent team — they have two guys
who will be sure first round draft choices." The
other first round choice is forward Kevin Restani, a
6-9'/2, 225 pound bruiser who contributed heavily to
USF's success in 1973 with 17.9 point and 12.7
rebound averages. Between Restani and center
Fernsten (6-9, 205), the USF front line can provide
more than adequate rebounding muscle.
Will the Dons repeat last year's killing'? Restani
thinks not. "Last year's game was no indication of
what's going to happen this time. Stanford is vastly
improved; they probably improved more in the
second half of the season than any other West Coast
team. And that [Rich] Kelley is some center."
Dominating Player
"Kelley could be the dominating type of player
who we really don't like to play against," added
Gaillard. "With the same people back, and with an
extra year of experience behind them, Stanford is
going to be highly improved. As far as I'm
concerned, Stanford is in the top 20. Other than
UCLA, they're about as tough as any one we'll
face."
So a good team marginally improved since last
season's opener will be meeting one that has fought
its way through the pangs of birth to become a
legitimate contender for the Pac-8 runnerup spot.
But it is still early in this year's campaign and
neither coach is attaching as much importance to
Monday's contest.
"When you're in a league as tough as the WCAC
and when you've got a schedule as tough as ours,
you have to take it a game at a time," said Gaillard.
How does Dallmar look at the USF game? "I
look at it as being the game after Nevada," he said.
