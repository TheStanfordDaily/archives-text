# Father—Son Combination Improves Wolfpack Fortunes
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
On the floor Friday night,
you'll see a basketball star named
Pete whose father is coach of the
team.
No, the Maraviches haven't
returned. The father-son
combination which last year
began to turn around the unlucky
fortune of Nevada-Reno's
Wolfpack is named Padgett.
Coach Jim Padgett probably
has fewer problems with his Pete
than Lou Maravich did with his at
LSU. "It's been very pleasurable
for me since he's a good
performer and very coachable."
Another difference is that the
younger Padgett is better known
for his team play and assists than
for gunning and dribbling. And
the sophomore forward, who
starred at Diablo High School in
Walnut Creek hasone other ability
— rebounding.
Last year, as a freshman, Pete
averaged 17.8 rebounds per game,
third in the nation, despite not
being, at 6-B'/2, the tallest player
on very many courts.
Rebounding Tools
"He has all the tools a good
rebounder should have," Coach
Padgett said. "He has good size,
excellent spring and a knack for
finding the ball — I don't know if
that's something you can really

coach."
With Padgett and center David
Webber (6-8) hitting the boards,
Reno will play for the fast break
whenever it can get the quick
outlet pass. On defense, the
Wolfpack will play what Padgett
calls "agressive man-to-man,"
including some pressing.
"We play a similar game
strategy-wise to Coach Dallmar's
team," Padgett says. "But we're
probably a little overmatched
height-wise."
Padgett knows quite a bit
about the way Stanford plays
basketball. He coached at
California for seven years before
leaving for Nevada-Reno in 1972,
where he faced a difficult task.
"All their players had
graduated; so I had four or five
weeks to recruit a completely new
team."
Quick Transformation
In addition, Reno wasn't
exactly a hotbed of basketball
tradition, the Wolfpack having
won only three conference games
in the previous three seasons. But
Padgett's patchwork combination
of freshman and junior college
transfers quickly excited the city.
"There's a great interest in
athletics here, and our attendance
— and the total response to the
team — was quite good," Padgett
said. The team finished the year
with a respectable 10-16 record,
5-9 in games with West Coast
Athletic Conference (WCAC) foes.
But it'll be increasingly rough
for the Wolfpack to climb the
ladder of the tough WCAC, which
includes two teams ranked in the
nation's top 20 — San Francisco
(Stanford's opponent Monday)
and Nevada-Las Vegas —in addition
to always-tough Santa Clara.
"The top teams in this
conference can play with anyone
in the Pac-8 except UCLA, and no
one has beaten them too often
lately," Padgett understated. "I'd
rather not draw comparisons
between the two leagues .. .
there's an old saying, the best
league is the one you're coaching
in.
"I will say that the West Coast,
and that includes both leagues, is
the stronghold of defense in the
country."
Lowly Forecast
However the two leagues
match up, the WCAC, especially

now that Jerry Tarkanian, once
wizard of Long Beach State, has
recruited Las Vegas into natinal
prominence, is an
increasingly-strong league. Thus,
pre-season polls have picked the
Wolfpack for next-to-last place.
But Padgett feels his team is
improved over last season. "We've
got our top scorer back in Marv
Buckley," who averaged 21.4
points a game last year, Padgett
said. "He's an agile, quick forward
alot like Stanford's Mel
Arterberry." Buckley (6-4) is a
senior from Berkeley whom
followed through high school and
recruited out of junior college last
year.
"We're also a lot stronger at
guard than last year; we've got a
lot more depth. But we're still a
young team." (Six members of
the 12-man squad are freshmen or
sophomores.)
Despite intense competition,
Padgett feels he can continue to
recruit top prospects, the presence
of "Tark the Shark" at the other
end of the state notwithstanding.
"We're not as big as Las Vegas
| Reno's enrollment is 6,000], and
we have a different — and a good
— environment."
