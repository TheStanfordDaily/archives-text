SONY makes one heck of a lot of radios! Radios with digital clocks, FM, AM,
weather band and air band. They even make a weatherproof model and a
portable with an on off timer built in. Sony makes any combination
imaginable and Eber has them all.
EBER'S selection in Sony radios is like the wide selection in everything we
carry We've got over 50 different pairs of speakers on display and ready to
be listened to (and? 3 pairs of headphones). To power all those speakers we
have a wall full of components (and then some) waiting to be matched up
with any speakers you choose. There are turntables, tape machines and
everything else to supply your home (or commercial) audio needs, right
down to many hard to find replacement parts. Sony radios are an important
part of what we sell, but we sell much, much more than radios. If it's high
fidelity and high quality, we probably have it.
