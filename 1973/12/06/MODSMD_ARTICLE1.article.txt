# Eight Residences Remain Open Over Three Week Holiday Break
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Only eight of the 81 campus
residences which house single
students will remain open between
Dec. 15 and Jan. 4, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton
announced Tuesday.
The eight residences are
Blackwelder, Crothers, Crothers
Memorial, Hammarskjold, Hulme,
Manzanita Park, McFarland and
Mirrielees.
Some of the apartments and trailers
will be closed on an individual basis,
although the complexes themselves
will stay open, Horton said.
Virtually all undergraduate
dormitories, Row houses, independent
houses and fraternities will be closed
during the three week holiday break,
Horton said, in an effort to conserve

energy.
Approximately 700 students
petitioned the housing office to stay in
residences over the break, but only
192 will be relocated due to housing
shutdowns. The remaining 500 will
remain in their own residences.
Of those, 40 are assigned to "rooms
where another student will be on
vacation," while 152 will be placed in
"single rooms or rooms with a vacant
space," according to Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs David Bell.
However, for the most part,
relocated students will be paired with
regular residents of the complexes who
will be staying, Horton said.
'Note Of Understanding'.
Students sharing rooms under the
special arrangements must meet with
their temporary roommates before 5

p.m. tomorrow to discuss, complete
and sign a "note of understanding"
which outlines the legal responsibilities
of each student.
Prepared by students working with
the housing office and University legal
counsel, the document "insures
cognizance of legal responsibilities,
provides an opportunity for a
face-to-face meeting to negotiate and
agree on important points [such as the
use of private property and move
in/out dates] and serves as a record of
the agreements made," Bell wrote in
an open letter to students.
Horton said the "notes" would be
"legally binding in small claims court."
Storage Space
He also said the University will
accept "no more, no less responsibility
than usual" for students' personal
belongings during the break. However,
residences will offer free space in
"designated areas" for students
wishing to store personal items during
the recess.
Horton added that security
measures will be strengthened on a
campus-wide basis and that special
patrol of the residences will begin as
soon as they close.
Most students staying on campus
have already been contacted
preliminarily by residence staff and
have been advised as to whether they

will need to share their rooms or
move, he said.
Housing office and residence
personnel worked yesterday to send
each student planning to remain on
campus official notification of
Horton's decision and to advise
students of arrangements the office
has worked out for them.
All 700 students should receive
notice by this afternoon.
Lack Of Time
Both Horton and Bell apologized
for the lack of time students will have
to make housing arrangements for the
break, but pointed out that any
further delay would take students
away from work during finals week.
Plant Services has estimated the
energy savings resulting from residence
shutdowns at 328,000 therms of
natural gas or 164,000 gallons of fuel
oil — the equivalent of more than six
days normal heating use by the entire
University, including the Medical
Center. The buildings closed usually
house 4400 students.
Reaction to Horton's decision from
single graduate students — some of
whom had threatened to sue the
University if they were not allowed to
stay in their apartments — was one of
relief, Hulme resident staffer Margot
Baker said. The students have
apparently dropped the idea of a suit.

PRINCETON PREACHER — Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley,
shown here addressing a crowd in White Plaza, finally got a chance to debate his
controversial views on intelligence before a Princeton University audience
Tuesday afternoon. Disruptions and threatened disruptions have prevented
Shockley from appearing at other universities.
Only eight of the 81 campus
residences which house single
students will remain open between
Dec. 15 and Jan. 4, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton
announced Tuesday.
The eight residences are
Blackwelder, Crothers, Crothers
Memorial, Hammarskjold, Hulme,
Manzanita Park, McFarland and
Mirrielees.
Some of the apartments and trailers
will be closed on an individual basis,
although the complexes themselves
will stay open, Horton said.
Virtually all undergraduate
dormitories, Row houses, independent
houses and fraternities will be closed
during the three week holiday break,
Horton said, in an effort to conserve

energy.
Approximately 700 students
petitioned the housing office to stay in
residences over the break, but only
192 will be relocated due to housing
shutdowns. The remaining 500 will
remain in their own residences.
Of those, 40 are assigned to "rooms
where another student will be on
vacation," while 152 will be placed in
"single rooms or rooms with a vacant
space," according to Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs David Bell.
However, for the most part,
relocated students will be paired with
regular residents of the complexes who
will be staying, Horton said.
'Note Of Understanding'.
Students sharing rooms under the
special arrangements must meet with
their temporary roommates before 5

p.m. tomorrow to discuss, complete
and sign a "note of understanding"
which outlines the legal responsibilities
of each student.
Prepared by students working with
the housing office and University legal
counsel, the document "insures
cognizance of legal responsibilities,
provides an opportunity for a
face-to-face meeting to negotiate and
agree on important points [such as the
use of private property and move
in/out dates] and serves as a record of
the agreements made," Bell wrote in
an open letter to students.
Horton said the "notes" would be
"legally binding in small claims court."
Storage Space
He also said the University will
accept "no more, no less responsibility
than usual" for students' personal
belongings during the break. However,
residences will offer free space in
"designated areas" for students
wishing to store personal items during
the recess.
Horton added that security
measures will be strengthened on a
campus-wide basis and that special
patrol of the residences will begin as
soon as they close.
Most students staying on campus
have already been contacted
preliminarily by residence staff and
have been advised as to whether they

will need to share their rooms or
move, he said.
Housing office and residence
personnel worked yesterday to send
each student planning to remain on
campus official notification of
Horton's decision and to advise
students of arrangements the office
has worked out for them.
All 700 students should receive
notice by this afternoon.
Lack Of Time
Both Horton and Bell apologized
for the lack of time students will have
to make housing arrangements for the
break, but pointed out that any
further delay would take students
away from work during finals week.
Plant Services has estimated the
energy savings resulting from residence
shutdowns at 328,000 therms of
natural gas or 164,000 gallons of fuel
oil — the equivalent of more than six
days normal heating use by the entire
University, including the Medical
Center. The buildings closed usually
house 4400 students.
Reaction to Horton's decision from
single graduate students — some of
whom had threatened to sue the
University if they were not allowed to
stay in their apartments — was one of
relief, Hulme resident staffer Margot
Baker said. The students have
apparently dropped the idea of a suit.
