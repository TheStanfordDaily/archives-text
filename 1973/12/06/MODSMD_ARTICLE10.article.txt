# Unsatisfactory Building Site
## Housing Proposal Criticized 
### 
After having witnessed the recent lethargic
relocation of Stillman House, I rushed down to my
nearest neighborhood planning department in order
to survey other development projects, presently in
store for Stanford's campus. This is what I have
discovered:
Stanford University is in the process of
developing a portion of Lasuen St., with the intent
of constructing a one hundred-unit complex to
house faculty emeriti. I have yet to obtain the exact
dimensions of the proposed site; however, five acres
is a reasonably accurate estimation.
According to Oscar Nelson of the Stanford
Facilities Planning and Construction Department,
the project would involve tearing down the
elementary school which currently houses the
Stanford Community Day Care Center; tearing
down a music annex; relocation of Hurlburt House,
cutting down a "minimum" number of trees; and
development of a lawned open space
(approximately 20 x 50 yards).
At this time, the University is looking into other
suitable locations for both the music annex and day
care center. The proposed site is located in one of
the oldest and most aesthetically pleasing parts of
campus — situated between a series of student
dormitories on the west side of the site, and three
privately-owned homes on the east side of the site.
Apparently, this area was designated by the
University as a general housing zone some five or six
years ago. The faculty emeriti housing project was
later approved by the University Committee on
Land and Building Development (two years ago),
while the specific site on Lasuen St. was officially
approved one and a half years ago, after a task force
committee, headed by Prof. Hannah of the physics
department, looked into various alternative sites and
recommended the presently approved location. It
seems that at the time of the Lasuen site approval,
the planning department held an open meeting at
which voices of approval/disapproval were to be
aired, however campus residents failed to take
advantage of this opportunity.
Negotiations In Progress
Currently, the University is negotiating with a
development and architectural firm in San
Francisco. When the architects complete their
landscaping and design proposal, the nod must be
given by the University Committee on Land and
Building Development in order for ground breaking
to commence. This decision is due to come up in

Doug Sterne

approximately two to three months. Oscar Nelson
implied that if all goes well, the physical
construction of this complex will begin this coming
summer (1974).
It is my opinon, that the University's decision to
develop the Lasuen St. site should be challenged.
The negative consequences of such housing
development include the following:
1. It would be difficult to coordinate the
architectural design of a modern 100-unit complex
with that of the existing, older structures.
2. The proposed complex would inevitably result
in an increased traffic flow. This increase is
significantly undesirable, in that the new law school
location will already have multiplied the car
population in this area.
3. The development v/ould totally eliminate the
recreational value of the lawned open space.
4. Culturally speaking, the housing project invites
the possibility of a confrontation of life styles
between the faculty emeriti and neighboring
students. This concern lies in the interests of both
senior faculty members and students.
Disadvantages Outweigh Benefits
Where do the University's interests lie? In all
fairness, I do not believe that Stanford's
administration is as evil as I have made it out to be.
I recognize and respect the administration's desire
to satisfy the needs of its equally respected faculty
emeriti. The financial gain from such a project is
negligible, in that the cost of relocating various
structures and organizations, added to the cost of
design and construction, wipe out most of the
income that would be derived from rental
payments. Nevertheless, the negative consequences
listed above appear to outweigh the interests of the
University, and reconsideration of the proposed
location is in order.
Stanford has every legal right to railroad this
operation through, due to its private ownership of
the land involved. However, the administration is
also in the position where it must remain sensitive
to community opinion; and only through
community input can Stanford's land planning
policies be influenced.
Community members can act now by voicing
their approval/disapproval to Ed Shaw (x 3815). The
planning department will, at the very least, be
obligated to arrive at a more equitable decision.

develop the Lasuen St. site should be challenged.
The negative consequences of such housing
development include the following:
1. It would be difficult to coordinate the
architectural design of a modern 100-unit complex
with that of the existing, older structures.
2. The proposed complex would inevitably result
in an increased traffic flow. This increase is
significantly undesirable, in that the new law school
location will already have multiplied the car
population in this area.
3. The development v/ould totally eliminate the
recreational value of the lawned open space.
4. Culturally speaking, the housing project invites
the possibility of a confrontation of life styles
between the faculty emeriti and neighboring
students. This concern lies in the interests of both
senior faculty members and students.
Disadvantages Outweigh Benefits
Where do the University's interests lie? In all
fairness, I do not believe that Stanford's
administration is as evil as I have made it out to be.
I recognize and respect the administration's desire
to satisfy the needs of its equally respected faculty
emeriti. The financial gain from such a project is
negligible, in that the cost of relocating various
structures and organizations, added to the cost of
design and construction, wipe out most of the
income that would be derived from rental
payments. Nevertheless, the negative consequences
listed above appear to outweigh the interests of the
University, and reconsideration of the proposed
location is in order.
Stanford has every legal right to railroad this
operation through, due to its private ownership of
the land involved. However, the administration is
also in the position where it must remain sensitive
to community opinion; and only through
community input can Stanford's land planning
policies be influenced.
Community members can act now by voicing
their approval/disapproval to Ed Shaw (x 3815). The
planning department will, at the very least, be
obligated to arrive at a more equitable decision.

After having witnessed the recent lethargic
relocation of Stillman House, I rushed down to my
nearest neighborhood planning department in order
to survey other development projects, presently in
store for Stanford's campus. This is what I have
discovered:
Stanford University is in the process of
developing a portion of Lasuen St., with the intent
of constructing a one hundred-unit complex to
house faculty emeriti. I have yet to obtain the exact
dimensions of the proposed site; however, five acres
is a reasonably accurate estimation.
According to Oscar Nelson of the Stanford
Facilities Planning and Construction Department,
the project would involve tearing down the
elementary school which currently houses the
Stanford Community Day Care Center; tearing
down a music annex; relocation of Hurlburt House,
cutting down a "minimum" number of trees; and
development of a lawned open space
(approximately 20 x 50 yards).
At this time, the University is looking into other
suitable locations for both the music annex and day
care center. The proposed site is located in one of
the oldest and most aesthetically pleasing parts of
campus — situated between a series of student
dormitories on the west side of the site, and three
privately-owned homes on the east side of the site.
Apparently, this area was designated by the
University as a general housing zone some five or six
years ago. The faculty emeriti housing project was
later approved by the University Committee on
Land and Building Development (two years ago),
while the specific site on Lasuen St. was officially
approved one and a half years ago, after a task force
committee, headed by Prof. Hannah of the physics
department, looked into various alternative sites and
recommended the presently approved location. It
seems that at the time of the Lasuen site approval,
the planning department held an open meeting at
which voices of approval/disapproval were to be
aired, however campus residents failed to take
advantage of this opportunity.
Negotiations In Progress
Currently, the University is negotiating with a
development and architectural firm in San
Francisco. When the architects complete their
landscaping and design proposal, the nod must be
given by the University Committee on Land and
Building Development in order for ground breaking
to commence. This decision is due to come up in

Doug Sterne

approximately two to three months. Oscar Nelson
implied that if all goes well, the physical
construction of this complex will begin this coming
summer (1974).
It is my opinon, that the University's decision to
develop the Lasuen St. site should be challenged.
The negative consequences of such housing
