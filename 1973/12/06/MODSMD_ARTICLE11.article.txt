# Commentary On ‘The Other Stanford ’
## Report Lacks Conclusive Evidence 
### 
The Other Stanford is a very useful and challenging document; it
deserves careful reading by all of us. As a project report it deserves the
kind of searching criticism that apparently less than half of our
students obtain on any piece of work during their undergraduate years
at Stanford [p. 17].
The structure of argument in the Report runs something like this:
I. The main purpose of the faculty in the education of an
undergraduate is to ". . . stimulate critical thinking. .. ." [p. 16]
11. Four processes (styled, "outcomes" in the Report) contribute
to the fulfillment of this purpose: A. Challenging the student "on a
one-to-one basis" to think; B. taking the student's work seriously and
giving it the critical attention accorded to serious work; C. having an
impact on the student's intellectual development; D. stimulating the
student to think about ideas that go beyond the subject matter of the
course.
111. Three loci of personal contact (and within these three, eleven
types of interaction) are the settings in which the critical thinking
producing processes are most effectively exercised.
IV. Finally, four features of the University, as a social system, are
in the main responsible for affecting the extent of personal interaction
between student and faculty and, by the logic of the argument, the
goal of teaching critical thought.
On the whole the structure of argument is fine. Those familiar with
the Report will notice that my reconstruction differs in two
particulars from the text: I fail to mention "satisfaction" despite the
fact that the first fifteen pages of the Report focus on the question of
the satisfaction of undergraduates with their education at Stanford.
Indeed, the study established that seven students in ten are
satisfied and that on the average over seventy percent of the sample
think professors communicate openly with students about the
structure and content of courses; care about the quality of their
teaching; and are interested in student problems.
Argument Shifts
However, after establishing these facts and the further fact that
some types of non-classroom interaction are related to satisfaction [p.
15], the discussion of satisfaction is dropped and the focus of the
argument shifts to interaction and critical thinking along the lines
outlined above.

Richard Brody

The first premise of the argument, that a central intellectual goal of
a university education is the development, or at least the
encouragement, of a capacity for critical reasoning, is hard to argue
with.
There is also little reason to take issue with the Report's list of
processes or "outcomes." As it stands,, however, Report offers no
evidence for the connection between the and critical
thinking. We are stuck with an inferential rather than an existential
connection.
Missing Data
Therefore, the exact nature of these assertions becomes important
for policy making. For example, the Report stresses "one-to-one" as
the basis of the "challenge to think" [p. 16]. Only four students in
ten say they have been so challenged. However, from the point of
view of improving Stanford's ability to achieve the objective of
stimulating critical capacities, two data are missing: There is no
question asked of whether stimulation on a "one-to-few" or a
"one-to-many" basis takes place. This gap and the aforementioned
lack of a measure of critical thinking, leaves us unable to compare
how well different interaction settings do, for what kinds of students,
and for which subject matter. Without such data, we cannot evaluate
the assertion that the "tutorial" model is generally best.
There is plenty of evidence with which to judge the Report's
assertions about the relationship of the four "outcomes" and the
eleven types of interaction between faculty and student. The data are
clear, the interpretations are sound, and the message is unmistakable:
Those students who engage in (or are engaged in) academic and
personal interaction with faculty (e.g., do independent study, work on
joint research projects, take seminars as well as lecture courses, or who
seek and receive advice on career and personal matters) are much
more likely to be challeneged to think, to have their work taken
seriously, and to feel that faculty has affected their intellectual
development. Social interaction, as the Report states [p. 22], does
not much affect intellectual development. Only the give-and-take of
informal bull sessions seems clearly related to the "outcomes."
From the point of view of reform, planning, or simply doing
better, further analyses of these data would be desirable. As they
stand now the data suggest and the Report stresses "do everything" to
reform the system. But if the eleven forms of interaction (or the nine
that are related to "outcomes") are themselves highly interrelated, the
advice could as well be "do anything'''' or "do somethings" that are
easily doable.
Various Scopes
This is not to raise the question of causal interpreation (e.g., it is
not inconceiveable that the "outcomes" are causing the "personal"
interactions rather than the opposite causality which is stressed in the
Report) rather, I mean to emphasize that some forms of interaction
are within the scope of university-wide legislation, other forms fall to
the departments for decision, and still others are a matter of the
establishment of interpersonal relations between a student and a
faculty member and are as such beyond the reach of either university
or departmental jurisdiction. It would be a boom to reform or
improvement to know whether change can be accomplished without
attempting to legislate in inappropriate areas.
The real premise of the Report beyond Chapter I has to do with
the nature of a university, its role in society, and the value priorities
of the several sub-organizations of which the university is comprised.
Since the Task Force if it studied these matters does not report on
that study, we are left to accept, reject, or debate the Report's claims
but we cannot evaluate them on the basis of evidence. Without such
evidence, each of us is left with personal resources as the basis of
examining claims about what is generally the case within this
University or in other universities. For most of us, including the Task
Force, this is clearly an inadequate foundation for knowledge and
criticism.
Finally, it can be said that, when the data ran out that premises are
transposed to become conclusions. This is a persistent problem in the
social sciences. It is no defense but it should be acknowledged that the
authors of the Report are in good company while engaging in bad
practice. More seriously, the transposition of premises to conclusions
means that the recommendations ("Objectives") used to be read in
tandem with a careful study of the data. Some recommendations are
based on the data, others on a less firm foundation.
Beyond these problems, many features of the Report are
extraordinarily useful: Chapter I is full of good information which
served to unsettle my complacency. Chapter 111 has important
elements suggestive of agenda for C-US and which ought to spark
many departmental discussions. We are in the Task Force's debt for
the service they have done us.

transposed to become conclusions. This is a persistent problem in the
social sciences. It is no defense but it should be acknowledged that the
authors of the Report are in good company while engaging in bad
practice. More seriously, the transposition of premises to conclusions
means that the recommendations ("Objectives") used to be read in
tandem with a careful study of the data. Some recommendations are
based on the data, others on a less firm foundation.
Beyond these problems, many features of the Report are
extraordinarily useful: Chapter I is full of good information which
served to unsettle my complacency. Chapter 111 has important
elements suggestive of agenda for C-US and which ought to spark
many departmental discussions. We are in the Task Force's debt for
the service they have done us.
(Excrpted from a commentary by Richard A. Brody, professor of
political science.)
The Other Stanford is a very useful and challenging document; it
deserves careful reading by all of us. As a project report it deserves the
kind of searching criticism that apparently less than half of our
students obtain on any piece of work during their undergraduate years
at Stanford [p. 17].
The structure of argument in the Report runs something like this:
I. The main purpose of the faculty in the education of an
undergraduate is to ". . . stimulate critical thinking. .. ." [p. 16]
11. Four processes (styled, "outcomes" in the Report) contribute
to the fulfillment of this purpose: A. Challenging the student "on a
one-to-one basis" to think; B. taking the student's work seriously and
giving it the critical attention accorded to serious work; C. having an
impact on the student's intellectual development; D. stimulating the
student to think about ideas that go beyond the subject matter of the
course.
111. Three loci of personal contact (and within these three, eleven
types of interaction) are the settings in which the critical thinking
producing processes are most effectively exercised.
IV. Finally, four features of the University, as a social system, are
in the main responsible for affecting the extent of personal interaction
between student and faculty and, by the logic of the argument, the
goal of teaching critical thought.
On the whole the structure of argument is fine. Those familiar with
the Report will notice that my reconstruction differs in two
particulars from the text: I fail to mention "satisfaction" despite the
fact that the first fifteen pages of the Report focus on the question of
the satisfaction of undergraduates with their education at Stanford.
Indeed, the study established that seven students in ten are
satisfied and that on the average over seventy percent of the sample
think professors communicate openly with students about the
structure and content of courses; care about the quality of their
teaching; and are interested in student problems.
Argument Shifts
However, after establishing these facts and the further fact that
some types of non-classroom interaction are related to satisfaction [p.
15], the discussion of satisfaction is dropped and the focus of the
argument shifts to interaction and critical thinking along the lines
outlined above.

Richard Brody

The first premise of the argument, that a central intellectual goal of
a university education is the development, or at least the
encouragement, of a capacity for critical reasoning, is hard to argue
with.
There is also little reason to take issue with the Report's list of
processes or "outcomes." As it stands,, however, Report offers no
evidence for the connection between the and critical
thinking. We are stuck with an inferential rather than an existential
connection.
Missing Data
Therefore, the exact nature of these assertions becomes important
for policy making. For example, the Report stresses "one-to-one" as
the basis of the "challenge to think" [p. 16]. Only four students in
ten say they have been so challenged. However, from the point of
view of improving Stanford's ability to achieve the objective of
stimulating critical capacities, two data are missing: There is no
question asked of whether stimulation on a "one-to-few" or a
"one-to-many" basis takes place. This gap and the aforementioned
lack of a measure of critical thinking, leaves us unable to compare
how well different interaction settings do, for what kinds of students,
and for which subject matter. Without such data, we cannot evaluate
the assertion that the "tutorial" model is generally best.
There is plenty of evidence with which to judge the Report's
assertions about the relationship of the four "outcomes" and the
eleven types of interaction between faculty and student. The data are
clear, the interpretations are sound, and the message is unmistakable:
Those students who engage in (or are engaged in) academic and
personal interaction with faculty (e.g., do independent study, work on
joint research projects, take seminars as well as lecture courses, or who
seek and receive advice on career and personal matters) are much
more likely to be challeneged to think, to have their work taken
seriously, and to feel that faculty has affected their intellectual
development. Social interaction, as the Report states [p. 22], does
not much affect intellectual development. Only the give-and-take of
informal bull sessions seems clearly related to the "outcomes."
From the point of view of reform, planning, or simply doing
better, further analyses of these data would be desirable. As they
stand now the data suggest and the Report stresses "do everything" to
reform the system. But if the eleven forms of interaction (or the nine
that are related to "outcomes") are themselves highly interrelated, the
advice could as well be "do anything'''' or "do somethings" that are
easily doable.
Various Scopes
This is not to raise the question of causal interpreation (e.g., it is
not inconceiveable that the "outcomes" are causing the "personal"
interactions rather than the opposite causality which is stressed in the
Report) rather, I mean to emphasize that some forms of interaction
are within the scope of university-wide legislation, other forms fall to
the departments for decision, and still others are a matter of the
establishment of interpersonal relations between a student and a
faculty member and are as such beyond the reach of either university
or departmental jurisdiction. It would be a boom to reform or
improvement to know whether change can be accomplished without
attempting to legislate in inappropriate areas.
The real premise of the Report beyond Chapter I has to do with
the nature of a university, its role in society, and the value priorities
of the several sub-organizations of which the university is comprised.
Since the Task Force if it studied these matters does not report on
that study, we are left to accept, reject, or debate the Report's claims
but we cannot evaluate them on the basis of evidence. Without such
evidence, each of us is left with personal resources as the basis of
examining claims about what is generally the case within this
University or in other universities. For most of us, including the Task
Force, this is clearly an inadequate foundation for knowledge and
criticism.
Finally, it can be said that, when the data ran out that premises are
transposed to become conclusions. This is a persistent problem in the
social sciences. It is no defense but it should be acknowledged that the
authors of the Report are in good company while engaging in bad

improvement to know whether change can be accomplished without
attempting to legislate in inappropriate areas.
The real premise of the Report beyond Chapter I has to do with
the nature of a university, its role in society, and the value priorities
of the several sub-organizations of which the university is comprised.
Since the Task Force if it studied these matters does not report on
that study, we are left to accept, reject, or debate the Report's claims
but we cannot evaluate them on the basis of evidence. Without such
evidence, each of us is left with personal resources as the basis of
examining claims about what is generally the case within this
University or in other universities. For most of us, including the Task
Force, this is clearly an inadequate foundation for knowledge and
criticism.
Finally, it can be said that, when the data ran out that premises are
transposed to become conclusions. This is a persistent problem in the
social sciences. It is no defense but it should be acknowledged that the
authors of the Report are in good company while engaging in bad
practice. More seriously, the transposition of premises to conclusions
means that the recommendations ("Objectives") used to be read in
tandem with a careful study of the data. Some recommendations are
based on the data, others on a less firm foundation.
Beyond these problems, many features of the Report are
extraordinarily useful: Chapter I is full of good information which
served to unsettle my complacency. Chapter 111 has important
elements suggestive of agenda for C-US and which ought to spark
many departmental discussions. We are in the Task Force's debt for
the service they have done us.
(Excrpted from a commentary by Richard A. Brody, professor of
political science.)
The Other Stanford is a very useful and challenging document; it
deserves careful reading by all of us. As a project report it deserves the
kind of searching criticism that apparently less than half of our
students obtain on any piece of work during their undergraduate years
at Stanford [p. 17].
The structure of argument in the Report runs something like this:
I. The main purpose of the faculty in the education of an
undergraduate is to ". . . stimulate critical thinking. .. ." [p. 16]
11. Four processes (styled, "outcomes" in the Report) contribute
to the fulfillment of this purpose: A. Challenging the student "on a
one-to-one basis" to think; B. taking the student's work seriously and
giving it the critical attention accorded to serious work; C. having an
impact on the student's intellectual development; D. stimulating the
student to think about ideas that go beyond the subject matter of the
course.
111. Three loci of personal contact (and within these three, eleven
types of interaction) are the settings in which the critical thinking
producing processes are most effectively exercised.
IV. Finally, four features of the University, as a social system, are
in the main responsible for affecting the extent of personal interaction
between student and faculty and, by the logic of the argument, the
goal of teaching critical thought.
On the whole the structure of argument is fine. Those familiar with
the Report will notice that my reconstruction differs in two
particulars from the text: I fail to mention "satisfaction" despite the
fact that the first fifteen pages of the Report focus on the question of
the satisfaction of undergraduates with their education at Stanford.
Indeed, the study established that seven students in ten are
satisfied and that on the average over seventy percent of the sample
think professors communicate openly with students about the
structure and content of courses; care about the quality of their
teaching; and are interested in student problems.
Argument Shifts
However, after establishing these facts and the further fact that
some types of non-classroom interaction are related to satisfaction [p.
15], the discussion of satisfaction is dropped and the focus of the
argument shifts to interaction and critical thinking along the lines
outlined above.

Richard Brody

The first premise of the argument, that a central intellectual goal of
a university education is the development, or at least the
encouragement, of a capacity for critical reasoning, is hard to argue
with.
There is also little reason to take issue with the Report's list of
processes or "outcomes." As it stands,, however, Report offers no
evidence for the connection between the and critical
thinking. We are stuck with an inferential rather than an existential
connection.
Missing Data
Therefore, the exact nature of these assertions becomes important
for policy making. For example, the Report stresses "one-to-one" as
the basis of the "challenge to think" [p. 16]. Only four students in
ten say they have been so challenged. However, from the point of
view of improving Stanford's ability to achieve the objective of
stimulating critical capacities, two data are missing: There is no
question asked of whether stimulation on a "one-to-few" or a
"one-to-many" basis takes place. This gap and the aforementioned
lack of a measure of critical thinking, leaves us unable to compare
how well different interaction settings do, for what kinds of students,
and for which subject matter. Without such data, we cannot evaluate
the assertion that the "tutorial" model is generally best.
There is plenty of evidence with which to judge the Report's
assertions about the relationship of the four "outcomes" and the
eleven types of interaction between faculty and student. The data are
clear, the interpretations are sound, and the message is unmistakable:
Those students who engage in (or are engaged in) academic and
personal interaction with faculty (e.g., do independent study, work on
joint research projects, take seminars as well as lecture courses, or who
seek and receive advice on career and personal matters) are much
more likely to be challeneged to think, to have their work taken
seriously, and to feel that faculty has affected their intellectual
development. Social interaction, as the Report states [p. 22], does
not much affect intellectual development. Only the give-and-take of
informal bull sessions seems clearly related to the "outcomes."
From the point of view of reform, planning, or simply doing
better, further analyses of these data would be desirable. As they
stand now the data suggest and the Report stresses "do everything" to
reform the system. But if the eleven forms of interaction (or the nine
that are related to "outcomes") are themselves highly interrelated, the
advice could as well be "do anything'''' or "do somethings" that are
easily doable.
Various Scopes
This is not to raise the question of causal interpreation (e.g., it is
not inconceiveable that the "outcomes" are causing the "personal"
interactions rather than the opposite causality which is stressed in the
Report) rather, I mean to emphasize that some forms of interaction
are within the scope of university-wide legislation, other forms fall to
the departments for decision, and still others are a matter of the
establishment of interpersonal relations between a student and a
faculty member and are as such beyond the reach of either university
or departmental jurisdiction. It would be a boom to reform or
improvement to know whether change can be accomplished without
attempting to legislate in inappropriate areas.
