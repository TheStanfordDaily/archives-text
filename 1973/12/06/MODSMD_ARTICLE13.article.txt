# Intelligence Reduced To IQ Scores
## Shockley, Opponents: Insular Debate 
### 
Ten years ago, Professor
William Shockley read of a news
story that recounted the blinding
of a Jewish store owner by a black
youth in San Francisco. As more
information became available, he
discovered that this young man
had come from a poor family with
several children. In Chicago, at
about the same time, I read a
news item in which a black youth
had been beaten to death with a
baseball bat by white residents as
he awaited a bus to return home
one evening.

While in each case the setting
was urban and the violence racial,
the particulars were indeed
different. The Tribune (Chicago),
it should be pointed out, ran only
a brief article, whereas the
Chronicle gave a series of
additional articles on the same
topic. One of the "facts"
unearthed by the latter
investigation was the discovery
that the teenager involved had an
extremely low IQ (Intelligence
Quotient), as did his mother.
Obviously, this part of the story
prompted Shockley, as he has
cited in numerous places, to
wonder if racially low IQ was the
cause of violent crimes.
By 1965, at the Nobel
Conferences his views were
already crystalizing around a
non-Freudian hereditarian
argument. And in 1966, he began
a series of formal requests to his
favorite organization, the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS), and
was beginning to expand from
there into other forums.
Shockley has seen as his most
formidable opponents, the liberal
"orthodoxy" of academia. Those
that in his own words accept the
supposed "objectivity" of his
inquiry, but feel that the subject
is too politically touchy "at this
point." These "opponents" both
believe in a measureable thing
called "intelligence," both feel
that they are finding solutions to
the black "problem" and have
argued primarily over the methods
and policy implications of what
they have found.
Common Agreement
Since the only real difference is
over what determines low IQ
scores among blacks, the
implication appears to underline a
common agreement in black

inferiority. To Shockley and
others of his persuasion, the
determining element of inferiority
is heredity, to his objectors, as he
has rightly understood, it is
environment.
Mired within the depths of
their own academic insularity,
their common points of
agreement are seldom fully
examined. Both appear incapable
to question the more fundamental
epistemological considerations of
intelligence. Each has reduced the
equation of intelligence to a
question of IQ scores.
Monistic presumptions have
confined and impoverished most
of the debate to date. In many
ways the answer to the questions
they have posed already have been
determined by them. The
shibboleth that surfaces in the
exchange is "science," which
tends to mask a more troubling
postivistic idealism.
Emotions Scorned
This latter idealism scorns
emotions and worships figures.
While drawing their "insights"
from racial comparisons, they
both claim to advocate policies
which have disclaimers such as
"regardless of race, color, .. .
Because there is only one "truth,"
ther will be no epistemological
dilemma. To quote Shockley: "I
have faith in the motto ... 'The
Truth Shall Make You Free,' "
but who determines that truth?
Again one may allude to a
remark of Shockley's in 1965: "It
is clear that man's destiny will be
shaped by the acts of man." The
profound est tragedy is the hubris
that marks these words, the
myopic over-confidence in a
narrow rationalism. The belief

David Howard

that we have solved many physical
problems, now we are going to
solve social ones; the solution will
emerge from some form of
eugenics argues one side, and
"euthemics" is proposed by the
other.
While Shockley has compared
himself to Galileo and Pasteur, it
was not in reference to his research
that led to his Nobel Prize, rather
it was to his work on
"human-quality." He has
compared the NAS, of which he is
incidently a member, to Stalinist
Russia.
Liberal Saviors
Many of his consensus
opponents have seen themselves as
liberal saviors from the thrust of a
second Hitler's Germany. Yet for
all their machinations, they are
like two sides of a spinning coin,
flashing heads at times and tails at
others. Both sides see themselves
as big brother to the "black
sheep" of the family. Each knows
what is good for the little one,
and each feels that there is no
obligation to consult or
understand him. They must
explain to him his problem, and
give him "incentivies" to shape a
life for his own good.
To the more sophisticated of
each camp this is an unstated
analogy, but to Shockley, and
many of his confidents and
opponents the analogy is directly
committed to print. The Utopia
each envisions deviates very little,
it is the means that cause friction.
For those that do not see their
"truth" they would be penalized,
and perhaps in a more incidious
way than now.

William Shockley read of a news
story that recounted the blinding
of a Jewish store owner by a black
youth in San Francisco. As more
information became available, he
discovered that this young man
had come from a poor family with
several children. In Chicago, at
about the same time, I read a
news item in which a black youth
had been beaten to death with a
baseball bat by white residents as
he awaited a bus to return home
one evening.

While in each case the setting
was urban and the violence racial,
the particulars were indeed
different. The Tribune (Chicago),
it should be pointed out, ran only
a brief article, whereas the
Chronicle gave a series of
additional articles on the same
topic. One of the "facts"
unearthed by the latter
investigation was the discovery
that the teenager involved had an
extremely low IQ (Intelligence
Quotient), as did his mother.
Obviously, this part of the story
prompted Shockley, as he has
cited in numerous places, to
wonder if racially low IQ was the
cause of violent crimes.
By 1965, at the Nobel
Conferences his views were
already crystalizing around a
non-Freudian hereditarian
argument. And in 1966, he began
a series of formal requests to his
favorite organization, the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS), and
was beginning to expand from
there into other forums.
Shockley has seen as his most
formidable opponents, the liberal
"orthodoxy" of academia. Those
that in his own words accept the
supposed "objectivity" of his
inquiry, but feel that the subject
is too politically touchy "at this
point." These "opponents" both
believe in a measureable thing
called "intelligence," both feel
that they are finding solutions to
the black "problem" and have
argued primarily over the methods
and policy implications of what
they have found.
Common Agreement
Since the only real difference is
over what determines low IQ
scores among blacks, the
implication appears to underline a
common agreement in black

inferiority. To Shockley and
others of his persuasion, the
determining element of inferiority
is heredity, to his objectors, as he
has rightly understood, it is
environment.
Mired within the depths of
their own academic insularity,
their common points of
agreement are seldom fully
examined. Both appear incapable
to question the more fundamental
epistemological considerations of
intelligence. Each has reduced the
equation of intelligence to a
question of IQ scores.
Monistic presumptions have
confined and impoverished most
of the debate to date. In many
ways the answer to the questions
they have posed already have been
determined by them. The
shibboleth that surfaces in the
exchange is "science," which
tends to mask a more troubling
postivistic idealism.
Emotions Scorned
This latter idealism scorns
emotions and worships figures.
While drawing their "insights"
from racial comparisons, they
both claim to advocate policies
which have disclaimers such as
"regardless of race, color, .. .
Because there is only one "truth,"
ther will be no epistemological
dilemma. To quote Shockley: "I
have faith in the motto ... 'The
Truth Shall Make You Free,' "
but who determines that truth?
Again one may allude to a
remark of Shockley's in 1965: "It
is clear that man's destiny will be
shaped by the acts of man." The
profound est tragedy is the hubris
that marks these words, the
myopic over-confidence in a
narrow rationalism. The belief

David Howard

that we have solved many physical
problems, now we are going to
solve social ones; the solution will
emerge from some form of
eugenics argues one side, and
"euthemics" is proposed by the
other.
While Shockley has compared
himself to Galileo and Pasteur, it
was not in reference to his research
that led to his Nobel Prize, rather
it was to his work on
"human-quality." He has
compared the NAS, of which he is
incidently a member, to Stalinist
Russia.
Liberal Saviors
Many of his consensus
opponents have seen themselves as
liberal saviors from the thrust of a
second Hitler's Germany. Yet for
all their machinations, they are
like two sides of a spinning coin,
flashing heads at times and tails at
others. Both sides see themselves
as big brother to the "black
sheep" of the family. Each knows
what is good for the little one,
and each feels that there is no
obligation to consult or
understand him. They must
explain to him his problem, and
give him "incentivies" to shape a
life for his own good.
To the more sophisticated of
each camp this is an unstated
analogy, but to Shockley, and
many of his confidents and
opponents the analogy is directly
committed to print. The Utopia
each envisions deviates very little,
it is the means that cause friction.
For those that do not see their
"truth" they would be penalized,
and perhaps in a more incidious
way than now.

of a Jewish store owner by a black
youth in San Francisco. As more
information became available, he
discovered that this young man
had come from a poor family with
several children. In Chicago, at
about the same time, I read a
news item in which a black youth
had been beaten to death with a
baseball bat by white residents as
he awaited a bus to return home
one evening.

While in each case the setting
was urban and the violence racial,
the particulars were indeed
different. The Tribune (Chicago),
it should be pointed out, ran only
a brief article, whereas the
Chronicle gave a series of
additional articles on the same
topic. One of the "facts"
unearthed by the latter
investigation was the discovery
that the teenager involved had an
extremely low IQ (Intelligence
Quotient), as did his mother.
Obviously, this part of the story
prompted Shockley, as he has
cited in numerous places, to
wonder if racially low IQ was the
cause of violent crimes.
By 1965, at the Nobel
Conferences his views were
already crystalizing around a
non-Freudian hereditarian
argument. And in 1966, he began
a series of formal requests to his
favorite organization, the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS), and
was beginning to expand from
there into other forums.
Shockley has seen as his most
formidable opponents, the liberal
"orthodoxy" of academia. Those
that in his own words accept the
supposed "objectivity" of his
inquiry, but feel that the subject
is too politically touchy "at this
point." These "opponents" both
believe in a measureable thing
called "intelligence," both feel
that they are finding solutions to
the black "problem" and have
argued primarily over the methods
and policy implications of what
they have found.
Common Agreement
Since the only real difference is
over what determines low IQ
scores among blacks, the
implication appears to underline a
common agreement in black

inferiority. To Shockley and
others of his persuasion, the
determining element of inferiority
is heredity, to his objectors, as he
has rightly understood, it is
environment.
Mired within the depths of
their own academic insularity,
their common points of
agreement are seldom fully
examined. Both appear incapable
to question the more fundamental
epistemological considerations of
intelligence. Each has reduced the
equation of intelligence to a
question of IQ scores.
Monistic presumptions have
confined and impoverished most
of the debate to date. In many
ways the answer to the questions
they have posed already have been
determined by them. The
shibboleth that surfaces in the
exchange is "science," which
tends to mask a more troubling
postivistic idealism.
Emotions Scorned
This latter idealism scorns
emotions and worships figures.
While drawing their "insights"
from racial comparisons, they
both claim to advocate policies
which have disclaimers such as
"regardless of race, color, .. .
Because there is only one "truth,"
ther will be no epistemological
dilemma. To quote Shockley: "I
have faith in the motto ... 'The
Truth Shall Make You Free,' "
but who determines that truth?
Again one may allude to a
remark of Shockley's in 1965: "It
is clear that man's destiny will be
shaped by the acts of man." The
profound est tragedy is the hubris
that marks these words, the
myopic over-confidence in a
narrow rationalism. The belief

David Howard

that we have solved many physical
problems, now we are going to
solve social ones; the solution will
emerge from some form of
eugenics argues one side, and
"euthemics" is proposed by the
other.
While Shockley has compared
himself to Galileo and Pasteur, it
was not in reference to his research
that led to his Nobel Prize, rather
it was to his work on
"human-quality." He has
compared the NAS, of which he is
incidently a member, to Stalinist
Russia.
Liberal Saviors
Many of his consensus
opponents have seen themselves as
liberal saviors from the thrust of a
second Hitler's Germany. Yet for
all their machinations, they are
like two sides of a spinning coin,
flashing heads at times and tails at
others. Both sides see themselves
as big brother to the "black
sheep" of the family. Each knows
what is good for the little one,
and each feels that there is no
obligation to consult or
understand him. They must
explain to him his problem, and
give him "incentivies" to shape a
life for his own good.
To the more sophisticated of
each camp this is an unstated
analogy, but to Shockley, and
many of his confidents and
opponents the analogy is directly
committed to print. The Utopia
each envisions deviates very little,
it is the means that cause friction.
For those that do not see their
"truth" they would be penalized,
and perhaps in a more incidious
way than now.
