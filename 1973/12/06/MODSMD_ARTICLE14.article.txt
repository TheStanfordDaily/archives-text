# Dining In The Dark Doesn't Help
## A 						Break From Dorm Food 
### 
Today is Thursday of dead week and most of us
are looking forward to a weekend of cramming,
then taking those horrible tests and finally,
departing for parts unknown.
Just think about it; after next week there'll be no
more racing to meet deadlines, no more sleeping in a
bed that's as wide as a Nabisco Sugar Wafer, no
more sweaty registration lines to stand in and best
of all, no more residence hall cooking.
Looking back to the first weekend we arrived, I
can't help thinking the meals were better then.
There was no scholastic pressures, so digestion was
clean and easy. It didn't matter if the bread
shattered to pieces if you dropped it and stuck in
your gut like a gallstone if you ate it, because
professors hadn't started proffing and we had no
source of aggravation or anxiety.
There was no fuel shortage then, either, so Chef
Boy-Ar-Stern could leave the oven on longer and
give everyone bigger portions. There was more
variety in September also. Instead of just Filet of
Chuck, carrot and pea, they included a generous
helping of mixed vegetable and squish. 'Singular of
squash.)

Doug Witkins

the fact that the student committee had been
tasting various fine liquors for two hours prior to
the hamburger tasting session and were less than
100 percent sensitive to its flavor.

Tacos Ala Nothing
One day they were so short on meat they had the
gall to serve tacos without hamburger or filling or
anything! All they had was sauce and lettuce. This,
unfortunately, is absolutely true.
Eating breakfast is always fun. Remember the
first time you had pancakes here and you unknowingly
covered them with a generous portion of honey?
We can't say that the food service isn't trying,
though. This is evidenced by their constant attempts
at "special theme dinners." For example, do you
remember the "Western Round-Up?" That little
number was in late September.
Some creative person hung up three covered
wagons on a string and a few of the red coats wore
bandanas. Whooppee! I still don't understand why
they advertised the grand event for three days
previous.
See No Evil
Let's not neglect the Halloween Dinner. For this
one, everyone came dressed in their scariest costume
and the lights were all turned off (for effect). Well, I
don't know about you, but the scary costumes
didn't terrify me half as much as having to eat the
food in the dark. It's ghastly to think what one
might swallow not being able to see one's plate.
Then, there was the Thanksgiving Feast — a
hallowed affair with plenty of candles, but no
turkey. Again the lights were out for historic effect.
One night last week the power went off and
again the eating hall was submerged in darkness. By
this time, however, we had learned how to eat
"blindfolded," so we proceeded (in great
nonchalance) to ingest the tender morsels. All at
once, the lights came back on and shrills of anguish
immediately rang forth. "Yikes!" I heard someone
cry, "Look what we've been eating!"
Well, food fans, they'll be no more of that after
next week ... just good old home cooking and
setting tables and washing dishes and drying dishes
and setting tables and washing dishes and ...
Mother Stern, where are you????!!!

See No Evil
Let's not neglect the Halloween Dinner. For this
one, everyone came dressed in their scariest costume
and the lights were all turned off (for effect). Well, I
don't know about you, but the scary costumes
didn't terrify me half as much as having to eat the
food in the dark. It's ghastly to think what one
might swallow not being able to see one's plate.
Then, there was the Thanksgiving Feast — a
hallowed affair with plenty of candles, but no
turkey. Again the lights were out for historic effect.
One night last week the power went off and
again the eating hall was submerged in darkness. By
this time, however, we had learned how to eat
"blindfolded," so we proceeded (in great
nonchalance) to ingest the tender morsels. All at
once, the lights came back on and shrills of anguish
immediately rang forth. "Yikes!" I heard someone
cry, "Look what we've been eating!"
Well, food fans, they'll be no more of that after
next week ... just good old home cooking and
setting tables and washing dishes and drying dishes
and setting tables and washing dishes and ...
Mother Stern, where are you????!!!

every other Thursday on this page.)
Today is Thursday of dead week and most of us
are looking forward to a weekend of cramming,
then taking those horrible tests and finally,
departing for parts unknown.
Just think about it; after next week there'll be no
more racing to meet deadlines, no more sleeping in a
bed that's as wide as a Nabisco Sugar Wafer, no
more sweaty registration lines to stand in and best
of all, no more residence hall cooking.
Looking back to the first weekend we arrived, I
can't help thinking the meals were better then.
There was no scholastic pressures, so digestion was
clean and easy. It didn't matter if the bread
shattered to pieces if you dropped it and stuck in
your gut like a gallstone if you ate it, because
professors hadn't started proffing and we had no
source of aggravation or anxiety.
There was no fuel shortage then, either, so Chef
Boy-Ar-Stern could leave the oven on longer and
give everyone bigger portions. There was more
variety in September also. Instead of just Filet of
Chuck, carrot and pea, they included a generous
helping of mixed vegetable and squish. 'Singular of
squash.)

the fact that the student committee had been
tasting various fine liquors for two hours prior to
the hamburger tasting session and were less than
100 percent sensitive to its flavor.

Tacos Ala Nothing
One day they were so short on meat they had the
gall to serve tacos without hamburger or filling or
anything! All they had was sauce and lettuce. This,
unfortunately, is absolutely true.
Eating breakfast is always fun. Remember the
first time you had pancakes here and you unknowingly
covered them with a generous portion of honey?
We can't say that the food service isn't trying,
though. This is evidenced by their constant attempts
at "special theme dinners." For example, do you
remember the "Western Round-Up?" That little
number was in late September.
Some creative person hung up three covered
wagons on a string and a few of the red coats wore
bandanas. Whooppee! I still don't understand why
they advertised the grand event for three days
previous.
