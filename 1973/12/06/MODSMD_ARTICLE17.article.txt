# Retiree Fights For Cats
## 
### CAROL CHEN 
Dogs may be a more conspicuous problem
on campus, but roaming cats are becoming as
big a nuisance. Strays wander through campus
dormitories and a feline clan occupies the
Campus Bike Shop area by the Women's Gym.
For more than five years, a retired
employee of the Stanford Press, Pauline
Ninkovich, has fed the band of cats living
beneath the Bike Shop. She serves them
almost two and one-half pounds of dry food,
several cans of cat food and powdered milk
every day. She has taken in some of the cats
herself, and has found homes for others
through friends and the Pets-In-Need program.
However, Ninkovich charges that the
Stanford Department of Public Safety, the
Animal Shelter, and campus personnel have
been uncooperative in rounding up the
animals. Describing the relations between
Stanford and county animal officials, Jack
Sidlow, manager of Stanford Safety and
Health, admitted, "Right now, it's a pretty
loose kind of thing."
Ninkovich has tried to catch the animals
herself. "I did rent cages from Redwood
City," she explained, "and several years ago I

tried to catch them and they just ate the food
and got out." According to Santa Clara
Animal Control employee Robert Knox, level
ground and certain mechanical adjustments
may be necessary for the trap to operate
correctly.
Possibly, sympathetic passers-by have been
meddling with the traps. As Jewell Good of
Stanford Plant Services noted, "We don't
make any effort to catch the animals because
of all these ecology groups and animal lovers
on campus," who presumably fail
animal-roundup plans.
However, Ninkovich believes that catching
the cats would be more humane. She has
noticed, "There are so many females and
they'll just suffer (as they reproduce]."
Tapeworms, distemper, and eye sores infect
many of the animals.
Eventually, they will lose their home
beneath the Campus Bike Shop when
construction of the Terman Engineering
Center begins on that site.
As the cats' plight becomes worse, th?ir
illnesses may affect the public. Rabies
presents the most serious potential problem.
Santa Clara County, a declared rabies area,

receives an estimated 650 animal bite reports
monthly.
The time spent tracking down rabid
animals decreases the amount of time
available for stalking cats. With 41 animal
control officers to cover the entire county 24
hours a day, seven days a week, Knox admits,
"We're not in a position where we can find an
officer and ask him to go out and chase cats.
We handle biting animals, injured animals, sick
animals, vicious animals, dead animals,
owners' animals, loose livestock, complaint
investigations, and patrol for dogs running at
large."
Even with additional funds and personnel,
Knox points out that the wild cats are not
easily caught. He says that the public has the
initial responsibility of animal control.
If someone captures a stray, the Animal
Control Center (288-8700) will bring the
creature to the Animal Shelter where the
animal is held until it is given a home or
disposed of.
But, as Pauline Ninkovich discovered, "1
really couldn't [catch the cats]. I really tried.
It seems like someone in the animal shelter
business ought to have a solution."
