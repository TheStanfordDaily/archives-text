# Garriott To Speak Today About Skylab Experiences
## 
### 
University News Service
Back on Bay Area ground for
the first time since spending 59
days in space, Stanford
scientist-astronaut Dr. Owen K.
Garriott will talk about his
experiences on the second Skylab
mission at 11 a.m. today in
Bishop Auditorium of the
Graduate School of Business. His
lecture will be open to the public.
On leave from his post as a
professor of electrical engineering
since 1965 to the NASA Manned
Spacecraft Center in Houston,
Garriott with astronauts Jack
Lousma and Alan Bean set a new
record of 1427 hours and 9
minutes in space. They had
orbited earth 858 times and
traveled over 24 million miles
when they splashed down in the
Pacific Ocean on Sept. 25.

Garriott played a key role in
the enormous amount of scientific
work accomplished during the
mission, far above pre-flight
expectations. In particular, the
astronauts devoted 305 manhours
to solar studies with their $21
million worth of telescopic
equipment and took over 40,000
photographs of the sun.
Earthbound astronomers were
astonished by the quantity and
quality of their findings. The
concept of the corona was
drastically altered — instead of a
quiet, homogenous shell of
million-degree gases, it was
revealed as a region of colossal
upheaval and turbulence with
constant eruptions and flares
shooting up 100,000 miles.
The astronauts witnessed two
stupendous flares in early

September that reached
billion-degree temperatures, either
of which could have supplied the
world's energy needs for the next
500 years. Scientists still do not
know the cause of flares, but now
hope the Skylab data will give
them the answer.
Other surprises in the
corona included giant
caterpillar-shaped clouds erupting
and 40,000-mile-long bubbles of
gas exploding off into space,
disrupting magnetic fields and
causing radio bursts on earth.
Flares and similar eruptions have
sometimes caused power
transformers to explode, as well.
One scientist called it the most
intensive period of studying the
sun in history. "All of us," he
said, "can spend the rest of our
professional careers working on
the data from Skylab."

Earthbound astronomers were
astonished by the quantity and
quality of their findings. The
concept of the corona was
drastically altered — instead of a
quiet, homogenous shell of
million-degree gases, it was
revealed as a region of colossal
upheaval and turbulence with
constant eruptions and flares
shooting up 100,000 miles.
The astronauts witnessed two
stupendous flares in early

September that reached
billion-degree temperatures, either
of which could have supplied the
world's energy needs for the next
500 years. Scientists still do not
know the cause of flares, but now
hope the Skylab data will give
them the answer.
Other surprises in the
corona included giant
caterpillar-shaped clouds erupting
and 40,000-mile-long bubbles of
gas exploding off into space,
disrupting magnetic fields and
causing radio bursts on earth.
Flares and similar eruptions have
sometimes caused power
transformers to explode, as well.
One scientist called it the most
intensive period of studying the
sun in history. "All of us," he
said, "can spend the rest of our
professional careers working on
the data from Skylab."

SKYLAB SPEAKER—Electrical Engineering Prof. Owen K. Garriott,
who spent 59 days aboard the Skylab space station, will discuss his
experiences today at 11 a.m. in Bishop Auditorium of the Graduate
School of Business.

Back on Bay Area ground for
the first time since spending 59
days in space, Stanford
scientist-astronaut Dr. Owen K.
Garriott will talk about his
experiences on the second Skylab
mission at 11 a.m. today in
Bishop Auditorium of the
Graduate School of Business. His
lecture will be open to the public.
On leave from his post as a
professor of electrical engineering
since 1965 to the NASA Manned
Spacecraft Center in Houston,
Garriott with astronauts Jack
Lousma and Alan Bean set a new
record of 1427 hours and 9
minutes in space. They had
orbited earth 858 times and
traveled over 24 million miles
when they splashed down in the
Pacific Ocean on Sept. 25.

Garriott played a key role in
the enormous amount of scientific
work accomplished during the
mission, far above pre-flight
expectations. In particular, the
astronauts devoted 305 manhours
to solar studies with their $21
million worth of telescopic
equipment and took over 40,000
photographs of the sun.
