# Oldsters Have A Bowl On Lawn
## 
### PAUL YEUELL 
Dick Sund, recently retired
from the Stanford High Energy
Physics Laboratory, studies the
cluster of balls at the opposite end
of the bowling green. With a short
wind-up, he rolls his bowl across
the lawn and watches with
satisfaction as it cuts a gentle arc.
Sund fills his afternoon hours
with a pastime that has been
popular for over 5000 years —
lawn bowling. The sport which
was at one time the exclusive
domain of the English nobility,
has retained its standards of
courtesy and propriety.
Sund, a new member of the
Palo Alto Lawn Bowling Club, put
it bluntly: "We vote on every

bowler that we want to bring in,
or in some cases, put out."
Sund said he joined the club
recently because "After leaving
Stanford I knew that I'd need
something to keep me occupied."
Lawn bowling is a perfect
retirement activity, he said. The
game is a good mixture of exercise
and entertainment.
"It's a great game, involving
just the right amount of bowling,
walking and stooping," explained
bowler Bille Settle, another
retiree.
'Ecourage Young People'
This year's club president, Paul
Houseman, still active in the
construction industry said, "We'd
like to encourage more young
people to play." One female lawn
bowler said with a laugh that most
of the club's current members are
"99 and falling apart."
The close-cut green and the
well-trimmed hedges set the scene
for the slow-paced game. In
warmer months, all the players,
men and women alike, wear
white.
Every afternoon, the players
gather slowly — socializing,
preparing the green and shining
the heavy balls or "bowls."
Heavier Bowl
"The bowl is heavier on one
side," explains Houseman, "so
that as it slows down, it falls over
and curves."
It wobbles at first and then
smooths out with most of the
curve coming at the end of the
roll so the bowl nudges its way
toward the "jack" or target ball.
The bowl is designed to curve
so that a player can get around a
cluster of bowls should they be
blocking the target.
Highest Scorer
The highest scorer is the player
who rolls his bowl closest to the
"jack."
"Some fellows are blasters,"

explains Sund, "they'll throw
hard and fast to break things up."
Competition does exist in spite
of the dominant social side of the
game. Inter-club ladders and
intra-club matches inspire the
players.
'Fractions Of An Inch'
"Some matches are won by
only fractions of an inch on the
last bowl of the afternoon," says
Marjorie Bowcock, a Stanford
mother who has belonged to the
Palo Alto club for many years.
The most animate of the
intra-club competition is the
rivalry over the "Meat Axe"
trophy. Every year the Palo Alto
club challenges the Berkeley club
to determine the winner of the
"Meat Axe."
"They're good," explains
Bowcock. "They have two greens
over there. But we're getting
better." The Palo Alto club won

this year.
However, the congenial
atmosphere prevents competition
from taking over.
"We have barbeques on the
holidays," explains Bowcock
"and dancing and singing for tht
members."
The procedures of the game
reflect the friendly atmosphere of
lawn bowling. After each round
has been rolled, the score is tallied
and the losers bear the brunt of
good-natured kidding.
Then the losers must gather the
bowls. They need not bend over,
though. A back-saving "sweep,"
wheeled on tiny brass coasters by
one of the losers, collects the
bowls.
Even the bowler of a wild pitch
is treated courteously. The mild
reprimand is this: He must remit
one dime to the cluh.

"Some fellows are blasters,"

explains Sund, "they'll throw
hard and fast to break things up."
Competition does exist in spite

intra-club matches inspire the
players.
'Fractions Of An Inch'
"Some matches are won by
only fractions of an inch on the
last bowl of the afternoon," says
Marjorie Bowcock, a Stanford
mother who has belonged to the
Palo Alto club for many years.
The most animate of the
intra-club competition is the
rivalry over the "Meat Axe"
trophy. Every year the Palo Alto
club challenges the Berkeley club
to determine the winner of the
"Meat Axe."
"They're good," explains
Bowcock. "They have two greens
over there. But we're getting
better." The Palo Alto club won

this year.
However, the congenial
atmosphere prevents competition
from taking over.
"We have barbeques on the
holidays," explains Bowcock
"and dancing and singing for tht
members."
The procedures of the game
reflect the friendly atmosphere of
lawn bowling. After each round
has been rolled, the score is tallied
and the losers bear the brunt of
good-natured kidding.
Then the losers must gather the
bowls. They need not bend over,
though. A back-saving "sweep,"
wheeled on tiny brass coasters by
one of the losers, collects the
bowls.
Even the bowler of a wild pitch
is treated courteously. The mild
reprimand is this: He must remit
one dime to the cluh.

Dick Sund, recently retired
from the Stanford High Energy
Physics Laboratory, studies the
cluster of balls at the opposite end
of the bowling green. With a short
wind-up, he rolls his bowl across
the lawn and watches with
satisfaction as it cuts a gentle arc.
Sund fills his afternoon hours
with a pastime that has been
popular for over 5000 years —
lawn bowling. The sport which
was at one time the exclusive
domain of the English nobility,
has retained its standards of
courtesy and propriety.
Sund, a new member of the
Palo Alto Lawn Bowling Club, put
it bluntly: "We vote on every

bowler that we want to bring in,
or in some cases, put out."
Sund said he joined the club
recently because "After leaving
Stanford I knew that I'd need
something to keep me occupied."
Lawn bowling is a perfect
retirement activity, he said. The
game is a good mixture of exercise
and entertainment.
"It's a great game, involving
just the right amount of bowling,
walking and stooping," explained
bowler Bille Settle, another
retiree.
'Ecourage Young People'
This year's club president, Paul
Houseman, still active in the
construction industry said, "We'd
like to encourage more young
people to play." One female lawn
bowler said with a laugh that most
of the club's current members are
"99 and falling apart."
The close-cut green and the
well-trimmed hedges set the scene
for the slow-paced game. In
warmer months, all the players,
men and women alike, wear
white.
Every afternoon, the players
gather slowly — socializing,
preparing the green and shining
the heavy balls or "bowls."
Heavier Bowl
"The bowl is heavier on one
side," explains Houseman, "so
that as it slows down, it falls over
and curves."
It wobbles at first and then
smooths out with most of the
curve coming at the end of the
roll so the bowl nudges its way
toward the "jack" or target ball.
The bowl is designed to curve
so that a player can get around a
cluster of bowls should they be
blocking the target.
Highest Scorer
The highest scorer is the player
who rolls his bowl closest to the
"jack."
"Some fellows are blasters,"

explains Sund, "they'll throw
hard and fast to break things up."
