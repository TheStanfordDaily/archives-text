# Shockley Debates At Princeton
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT Special to the Daily 
PRINCETON, N.J. - For only the
third time in 11 attempts to speak at a
major university, Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley
debated virtually uninterrupted for
two hours at Princeton University
Tuesday afternoon, but at the cost of
his original opponent.
Roy Innis, director of the Congress
on Racial Equality who was originally
set to debate Shockley, withdrew
suddenly the afternoon of the debate
with a blast at Princeton's "snobbism
and elitism" for closing the debate to
most press and to the public.
Prominent anthropologist Ashley
Montagu replaced Innis. Innis himself
had requested the debate, and is
reported already trying to schedule it a
third time at Yale.
His first attempt to debate
Shockley, at Harvard in October, was
also canceled at the last minute under
pressure from Harvard's black law
students.
Inside the hall Tuesday, a quiet,
polite audience of 400 shrugged off a

reported bomb threat and heard
Shockley elaborate his views that the
primarily genetic control of
intelligence combined with a high
black birth rate could "downbreed"
the black population in this country.
IQ Tests
Montagu disputed a select few of
Shockley's views, among them the
value of IQ tests.
"IQ tests measure the intelligence
only of those who think they measure
intelligence," Montagu said. IQ tests
do measure social, economic and
educational background, he added.
Montagu is a retired professor of
anthropology. He has authored several
books, including Man's Most
Dangerous Sin: The Fallacy of Race.
Montagu backed his criticism of
Shockley's contention that intelligence
is 80 percent genetically determined
by citing studies that, Montagu said,
show severe environmental deprivation
can cause brain damage in animals.
Outside the hall, up to 400
demonstrators and onlookers burned
Shockley in effigy and once
threatened to storm the building, but

the only violence was brief and
occurred between two members of
rival radical organizations.
A coalition of 15 campus radical
groups issued a statement Sunday
calling for a boycott of the debate
rather than any attempt to prevent it.
In one of the few incidents inside
the hall, a black sophomore stood with
his back to the stage throughout the
debate to blast the audience for
attending and thus "legitimizing the
subject" of the debate.
Press Limited
Organizers of the event, the
Whig-Cliosophic Debate Society at
Princeton, generally agreed that the
debate succeeded because the general
press and the public were prevented
from attending. Shockley was given 10
press tickets to distribute. Innis would
have had the same number, had he
shown up.
Television cameras were banned
because they would have allegedly
encouraged protest. All three
television networks were refused
permission to cover the Princeton
appearance.

"The most important thing about
the debate was that it happened," said
Whig-Clio Vice President Henry
Handler afterwards.
The two campuses where Shockley
has spoken uninterrupted besides
Princeton are Stanford last January
and the University of Washington.

Dangerous Sin: The Fallacy of Race.
Montagu backed his criticism of
Shockley's contention that intelligence
is 80 percent genetically determined
by citing studies that, Montagu said,
show severe environmental deprivation
can cause brain damage in animals.
Outside the hall, up to 400
demonstrators and onlookers burned
Shockley in effigy and once
threatened to storm the building, but

the only violence was brief and
occurred between two members of
rival radical organizations.
A coalition of 15 campus radical
groups issued a statement Sunday
calling for a boycott of the debate
rather than any attempt to prevent it.
In one of the few incidents inside
the hall, a black sophomore stood with
his back to the stage throughout the
debate to blast the audience for
attending and thus "legitimizing the
subject" of the debate.
Press Limited
Organizers of the event, the
Whig-Cliosophic Debate Society at
Princeton, generally agreed that the
debate succeeded because the general
press and the public were prevented
from attending. Shockley was given 10
press tickets to distribute. Innis would
have had the same number, had he
shown up.
Television cameras were banned
because they would have allegedly
encouraged protest. All three
television networks were refused
permission to cover the Princeton
appearance.

"The most important thing about
the debate was that it happened," said
Whig-Clio Vice President Henry
Handler afterwards.
The two campuses where Shockley
has spoken uninterrupted besides
Princeton are Stanford last January
and the University of Washington.
PRINCETON, N.J. - For only the
third time in 11 attempts to speak at a
major university, Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley
debated virtually uninterrupted for
two hours at Princeton University
Tuesday afternoon, but at the cost of
his original opponent.
Roy Innis, director of the Congress
on Racial Equality who was originally
set to debate Shockley, withdrew
suddenly the afternoon of the debate
with a blast at Princeton's "snobbism
and elitism" for closing the debate to
most press and to the public.
Prominent anthropologist Ashley
Montagu replaced Innis. Innis himself
had requested the debate, and is
reported already trying to schedule it a
third time at Yale.
His first attempt to debate
Shockley, at Harvard in October, was
also canceled at the last minute under
pressure from Harvard's black law
students.
Inside the hall Tuesday, a quiet,
polite audience of 400 shrugged off a

reported bomb threat and heard
Shockley elaborate his views that the
primarily genetic control of
intelligence combined with a high
black birth rate could "downbreed"
the black population in this country.
IQ Tests
Montagu disputed a select few of
Shockley's views, among them the
value of IQ tests.
"IQ tests measure the intelligence
only of those who think they measure
intelligence," Montagu said. IQ tests
do measure social, economic and
educational background, he added.
Montagu is a retired professor of
anthropology. He has authored several
books, including Man's Most
Dangerous Sin: The Fallacy of Race.
