Where can a person regularly
buy gasoline around Stanford late
at night? M.E.

Nowhere. Most gas stations in
Palo Alto close sometime between
5:30 and 9 p.m., and even those
hours aren't regular. Several gas
station attendants indicated that
their pumps would close down
when the gas ran out, and they
had no way of accurately
predicting when that would
happen each day.
Page Mill Mobil station, 2780
El Camino Real, stays open until
midnight if there is gas, according
to an attendant. He warned that
the station closes when the gas
runs out, no matter what time
that happens.

How come fines for traffic
citations go to the County instead
of to Stanford, when it is private
property and a Stanford employee
does the ticketing? B.D.
When a Stanford employee
issues a traffic citation he does so
in his capacity as a reserve deputy
sheriff for Santa Clara County,
said Helene Ingelson, Police
Services secretary.
Capt. William Wullschleger
explained that the County sheriff
is responsible for all
unincorporated areas — like
Stanford. That means that
although Stanford is private
property it comes under the
County sheriff's jurisdiction.
So the reason traffic fines go to
the County is because a reserve
deputy authorized by the County
sheriff issues the citation.

Why isn't the Meyer Audio
Library open more than just four
hours on Saturdays and Sundays?
The Language IMb stays open
twice as long over weekends. The
Audio room contains many
class-related lecture tapes and
musical selections that are needed 1
to study. M.S.
An assistant librarian with'
Audio Services said that the hours
seem to be "working out all
right." She indicated, however,
that it wouldn't be possible to
keep the Audio Library open
longer even if students requested
it because the library budget has
been cut back a lot.
