# Rosaldo Returns To Phillipines
## 'Brother' Of Headhunter 
### CHRIS TOREM 
In the highlands of Luzon, an
Ilongot headhunter named
Tukbaw has learned through the
miracle of recorded tape that his
American "brother," Stanford
Asst. Prof. Renato Rosaldo, will
return to the Phillipines after four
years absence.
The unusual friendship
between the Harvard-trained
anthropologist, twice the recipient
of National Science Foundation
grants and the author of 18
published articles, and the
illiterate but eloquent Tukbaw,
considered a "charismatic" orator
by his people, began in 1967.
Rosaldo, then a graduate student,
and his wife Michelle spent several
months in Tukbaw's home
learning Ilongot, charting the area
and participating in many phases
of local life.
In March, 1968, Tukbaw asked
Rosaldo to accompany him to a
modern hospital to have a painful
back-ache treated. Rosaldo spent
the night watching over his friend.
"Perhaps I felt a diffuse sense
of loyalty, or of what brothers
should do," wrote Rosaldo in his
unpublished biographical article,
"Tukbaw: They Listen While He
Orates." "In any case, my having
remained there was a turning
point in our growing sense of
mutual trust; Tukbaw had been
terrified at the thought of being
abandoned and left alone in the
hospital."
Tukbaw later expressed his
gratitude during a language lesson:
"Now I am giving my brother
words in Ilongot, for that is why
he has come to Ilongot
country ... Even I, his brother,
will be very happy when he knows
our language."
Such a personal commitment
of time and empathy is not
unusual for the 32-year old
Rosaldo. As an undergraduate at
Harvard, he pursued a 1961
summer field project in Equador
to the point where he traveled
with a migrant worker from the
mountains to the coast just to
record the latter's life. Student
Rosaldo also became a first-rate
banana-picker.
Rosaldo's many travels abroad
also changed his political beliefs.
In 1963, he had been in Franco's
Spain studying Romance
Philology at the University of
Madrid. Shocked by the
widespread political surveillance
and terror (parents of his friends
had been marked for execution
for up to 20 years) and by the
narrowness of Fascist thought, he
left for France much earlier than
he had planned.
"I had thought that politics
was divorced from village life but,
as Spain proved to me, that was
just stupid," he says.
Rosaldo's interest in
humanistic anthropology was a
logical outgrowth of his
undergraduate concentration in
Spanish literature and history.

Originally, he had intended to
learn the scholastic methods of
criticism, but his field trips to
Latin America convinced him that
he enjoyed working with people
as much or more than library
learning. By the time he applied
to Harvard for graduate
admission, he was unsure of which
discipline to pursue.
"I had figured to let the
admissions committee make the
decision for me," he remembers.
"But I was accepted in both
anthropology and Spanish
literature. I spent several hours
pacing up and down the Left
Bank in Paris with two signed
letters in my pocket."
His final decision was entirely
subjective, he remembers. "I liked
the people going into
anthropology better than I liked
the people going into Spanish
literature. After all, what's in
being an intellectual? You might
as well talk to people you like and
that have something to say."
In 1966, he married Michelle,
then a first-year Harvard graduate
student in anthropology. The next
year, they received a grant to
study the Ilongots, a tribe which
was, in Rosaldo's words,
"previously undescribed."
One reason that so little was
known about the Ilongots was
that few westerners had been able
or willing to penetrate this society
of reputedly fierce headhunters.
The Rosaldos however, found that
the major problem was isolation
rather than decapitation. Except
for a few missionaries, there were
no other westerners within several
days journey by foot.
"It was almost captivity,"
Rosaldo recalls. "We were always
straining to hear the words."
Tukbaw taught his guests by
ordering them to do simple chores
and pointing so that the meaning
of the words became clear. As
Rosaldo's vocabulary increased he
asked more complex questions.
"On the hunts, I first asked
what kind of animals were killed.
Then I could talk to the people
about how the killing was done,
who was in what position, and so
on," he says.
After they mastered the
language, the Rosaldos found
Ilongot culture to be "incredibly
rich and rewarding." All the
adults shared in tribal skills,
although some individuals were
naturally better at particular
activities.
On the other hand, Rosaldo
discovered that there were
intercultural boundaries that
could not be crossed. "In the
Ilongot world, you could only
partially be you," he says. "They
could get a fairly good sense of
who you were with them, but
they could never get a full sense
of who you were in English."
From his field experience,
Rosaldo concluded that
anthropology was a way to

"confront the essential otherness
of other cultures."
"This is not to deny the
essential psychic unity of
mankind," he says. "Everybody
speaks language in general. But
everybody only speaks a
particular language."
After returning home to
Harvard in 1969, Rosaldo realized
how deeply involved he had been
in the Ilongot experience. While
lecturing one day, he realized as
he was speaking that Ilongot
habits and values he had grown to
"take for granted" were unique.
"It had just seemed so natural
after a while to do things in that
way " he says.
In 1970, Rosaldo accepted an
offer to teach at Stanford, despite
his apprehension at being the only
chicano Ph.D. on campus. Soon
he was spending a great deal of
time trying to bring in more
chicano faculty, as well as guide
the Chicano Fellows program, a
formal in which graduate students
teach and advise undergraduates.
In 1973, there are still only nine
chicano faculty members to advise
more than 500 students.
In the classroom, Rosaldo is
not a flamboyant teacher. His
course in primitive religion deals
with abstractions and he prefers
to guide the conversation rather
than to lead it. He slouches in his
chair, listening to his graduate
students spin arguments full of
"structures," "functions,"
"hierarchies," and other
anthropological jargon as if he
were back in the field taking notes
on some new culture.
Then, suddenly, he intervenes
with a simple phrase like "Do you
mean . . ." or "Maybe what you're
saying is. .and brings the
discussion back down to reality.
His students and colleagues
praise him highly and in a way
that merges the categories of
"teacher" and "person."
"He's open to alternatives, but
when he does come up with a
criticism, he's so gentle about it
that you don't feel put down,"
says graduate student Charlie
Drucker. Rosaldo's advisee for
three years, Drucker has already
spent one summer doing field
work in the Phillipines.
Juan Garcia, a first-year
graduate student, feels that
Rosaldo has been crucial in
guiding Chicano students having
trouble adjusting to Stanford. "I
was told to get in touch with him
and his wife when I arrived," he
says."He was very good at
keeping me working on my
writing and my reading. It was
probably pretty good for me or I
might have stopped."
Michelle Rosaldo thinks that
her husband is primarily a "gentle
man," but she adds, "I keep
discovering new dimensions about
him." One of those new
dimensions — doggedness —
emerged when Rosaldo braved the

taboo against husband-wife
professorships and succeeded in
wringing out a position for
Michelle. She feels that the
department of anthropology also
"bent over backwards to keep the
two of us. I feel that we're now
both appreciated and valued by
the department."
Rosaldo was also instrumental
in the battle to modify Project
SCOR last spring. SCOR, a joint
effort of the Stanford Med School
and the Department of
Communication, had attempted
to use behavior-modification
techniques to reduce incidents of
heart disease in nearby chicano
communities.
A number of chicano
intellectuals, including Rosaldo,
had objected to the potential
danger of such psychological
techniques when applied to
subjects who were not fully aware
of being experimental subjects.
Eventually, according to Rosaldo
and Education Prof. Art Pacheco,
SCOR was changed and chicanos
appointed to the pane! of
monitors.
Rosaldo takes the position of
chicanos here seriously. "The
dominant attitude here is that
they've got a nice country club
and we should be happy to get in
at all. That's a mistake. The
University still does not realize
that it has an incredible resource
in the chicano community. Many
of the people have a wide range of
talents."
