# Project Eyes Risk Of Heart Disease

University News Service
More than 3500 faculty and
staff members here so far have
participated in a free screening
program designed to evaluate the
risk factors in heart disease.
During the next few months
another 1000 participants are
needed, including volunteers,
according to physiologist William
Haskell, project coordinator.
Participants must be age 26 or
older an employee here on March
1, 1973, 50 percent time or more.
Hospital employees are not
eligible.
For most employees the
screening will consist of a
15-minute health evaluation,
including a brief medical
questionnaire, measurements of
height, weight, and blood
pressure, plus cholesterol and
triglyceride (fat) analysis of a
blood sample.
Results of the screening are
provided direct to participants or
to their physicians. Initial
screenings will be conducted in
Room 340, Graduate School of
Business from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Monday through Friday from now
through March, except for holiday
period Dec. 21 to Jan. 2.
If you meet the age and
employment qualifications and
want to participate, you can
schedule an appointment by
calling University ext. 2529 or

6256. A 12-hour fast is required
before the blood sample is drawn.
Approximately 25 percent of
the participants will be asked to
return for a second, more
extensive examination. This group
will include a random sample of
all participants as well as
individuals found to have high
blood fats their first visit.
"The purpose of the program is
to determine the frequency of
certain characteristics associated
with a high risk of developing
premature heart and vascular
disease," Haskell explains.
"For the participants this is an
opportunity to learn more about
their own 'heart health' status and
contribute to research on how to
prevent heart attacks."
Several participants in the
initial screening already were
found to have unsuspected high
blood pressure, Haskell notes.
But even those who have
prepaid medical programs and
obtain regular physical checkups
are needed for the screening
sample, Haskell says. Between
4500 and 5000 of the University's
5900 eligible employees are
needed to provide valid results for
the program.
He praised the "exceptionally
good cooperation" of supervisors
in helping employees arrange for
participation.

Participants must be age 26 or
older an employee here on March
1, 1973, 50 percent time or more.
Hospital employees are not
eligible.
For most employees the
screening will consist of a
15-minute health evaluation,
including a brief medical
questionnaire, measurements of
height, weight, and blood
pressure, plus cholesterol and
triglyceride (fat) analysis of a
blood sample.
Results of the screening are
provided direct to participants or
to their physicians. Initial
screenings will be conducted in
Room 340, Graduate School of
Business from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Monday through Friday from now
through March, except for holiday
period Dec. 21 to Jan. 2.
If you meet the age and
employment qualifications and
want to participate, you can
schedule an appointment by
calling University ext. 2529 or

6256. A 12-hour fast is required
before the blood sample is drawn.
Approximately 25 percent of
the participants will be asked to
return for a second, more
extensive examination. This group
will include a random sample of
all participants as well as
individuals found to have high
blood fats their first visit.
"The purpose of the program is
to determine the frequency of
certain characteristics associated
with a high risk of developing
premature heart and vascular
disease," Haskell explains.
"For the participants this is an
opportunity to learn more about
their own 'heart health' status and
contribute to research on how to
prevent heart attacks."
Several participants in the
initial screening already were
found to have unsuspected high
blood pressure, Haskell notes.
But even those who have
prepaid medical programs and
obtain regular physical checkups
are needed for the screening
sample, Haskell says. Between
4500 and 5000 of the University's
5900 eligible employees are
needed to provide valid results for
the program.
He praised the "exceptionally
good cooperation" of supervisors
in helping employees arrange for
participation.
