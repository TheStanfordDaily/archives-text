# Blind Students Succeed With Extra Time, Effort
## 
### VALERIE DOW 
What do a collegiate wrestler, a
teaching fellow in the law school,
a Stanford engineer and a teaching
assistant in the English
department have in common?
They are ambitious, successful
and they are blind.
"A blind person can do nearly
anything he would do otherwise,
but with a little extra time, effort,
and ingenuity," said Ted Primm,
law school teaching fellow. Primm
was a student legislator and an
SAE fraternity officer as an
undergraduate here, and now
designs and grades research
projects for first year law
students.
The University does not keep
track of Stanford's blind students
and there is no campus social
action group to help them. Their
interests are so varied and their
desire to be independent is so
strong, that Stanford gives them
only minimal aid.
An information pamphlet for
blind students was prepared two
years ago by Harold Boyd,
associate dean of student affairs.
According to engineer Loren
Schoff, who helped compile the

pamphlet, "All I wanted from the
university was what I absolutely
needed: on-campus housing and a
list of the local services to the
blind. I didn't want people
watching out for me."
Schoff was an undergraduate
here and received a masters degree
in systems analysis from the
School of Engineering. He is
currently working in the
marketing division of Telesensory
Systems, Inc., which
manufactures the Optacon, a
reading device for the blind.
Optacon was developed here
by Dr. John Linvill, chairman of
the electrical engineering
department. With a camera about
the size of a pocket knife moving
across a printed page, photo
transistors activate tiny pins
which form a raised impression of
the print on the operator's finger.
Linvill's daughter, Candy, is
also a blind student here. Candy is
a senior living in Walt Whitman
House. She is a psychology major,
completing a humanities honors
thesis on children's fantasy
stories.
Noting that none of the blind
students have any real contact
with each other and don't seem

anxious for association, Candy
said, "We all grew up with sighted
friends. I guess that since blind
students haven't gotten together
yet it makes me feel we don't
need to."
Beyond dealing with practical
concerns at Stanford — managing
studies, getting across campus,
and moving off-campus and
around the community, blind
students are of course concerned
with the future. The obstacles
they face can be serious.
Primm said law firms are
extremely reluctant to hire a blind
person. "I am disappointed," he
said, "that lawyers who should be
pushing out the edges of
progressivism should be so
hesitant to get involved even when
a blind student has good
credentials."
Nevertheless, these determined
students refuse to chance their
ambitious plans.
Blind undergraduates refuse to
isolate themselves from everyday
university life. Junior Bob
Sweetman is on the Stanford
wrestling team. Primm is a touch
football quarterback. Linvill
studied at the Stanford-in-
Germany campus for six months.

currently working in the
marketing division of Telesensory
Systems, Inc., which
manufactures the Optacon, a
reading device for the blind.
Optacon was developed here
by Dr. John Linvill, chairman of
the electrical engineering
department. With a camera about
the size of a pocket knife moving
across a printed page, photo
transistors activate tiny pins
which form a raised impression of
the print on the operator's finger.
Linvill's daughter, Candy, is
also a blind student here. Candy is
a senior living in Walt Whitman
House. She is a psychology major,
completing a humanities honors
thesis on children's fantasy
stories.
Noting that none of the blind
students have any real contact
with each other and don't seem

anxious for association, Candy
said, "We all grew up with sighted
friends. I guess that since blind
students haven't gotten together
yet it makes me feel we don't
need to."
Beyond dealing with practical
concerns at Stanford — managing
studies, getting across campus,
and moving off-campus and
around the community, blind
students are of course concerned
with the future. The obstacles
they face can be serious.
Primm said law firms are
extremely reluctant to hire a blind
person. "I am disappointed," he
said, "that lawyers who should be
pushing out the edges of
progressivism should be so
hesitant to get involved even when
a blind student has good
credentials."
Nevertheless, these determined
students refuse to chance their
ambitious plans.
Blind undergraduates refuse to
isolate themselves from everyday
university life. Junior Bob
Sweetman is on the Stanford
wrestling team. Primm is a touch
football quarterback. Linvill
studied at the Stanford-in-
Germany campus for six months.
What do a collegiate wrestler, a
teaching fellow in the law school,
a Stanford engineer and a teaching
assistant in the English
department have in common?
They are ambitious, successful
and they are blind.
"A blind person can do nearly
anything he would do otherwise,
but with a little extra time, effort,
and ingenuity," said Ted Primm,
law school teaching fellow. Primm
was a student legislator and an
SAE fraternity officer as an
undergraduate here, and now
designs and grades research
projects for first year law
students.
The University does not keep
track of Stanford's blind students
and there is no campus social
action group to help them. Their
interests are so varied and their
desire to be independent is so
strong, that Stanford gives them
only minimal aid.
An information pamphlet for
blind students was prepared two
years ago by Harold Boyd,
associate dean of student affairs.
According to engineer Loren
Schoff, who helped compile the

pamphlet, "All I wanted from the
university was what I absolutely
needed: on-campus housing and a
list of the local services to the
blind. I didn't want people
watching out for me."
Schoff was an undergraduate
here and received a masters degree
in systems analysis from the
School of Engineering. He is
currently working in the
marketing division of Telesensory
Systems, Inc., which
manufactures the Optacon, a
