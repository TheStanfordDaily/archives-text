# PACDAB Earns Praise, Criticism After First Year
## 
### RALPH COHEN 
A little more than halfway
through its two-year contract with
the city of Palo Alto, the Palo
Alto Community Drug Abuse
Board (PACDAB) continues to
draw criticism from some city
council memgers in spite of a
favorable first-year evaluation.
The evaluation was conducted
by a team of observers from the
John F. Kennedy Institute for
Drug Abuse, Education, and
Research in Martinez as part of
the contract between PACDAB
and Palo Alto.
Writing in the evaluation, Dr.
Allan Y. Cohen, head of the
observation team and a former
student under drug cultist
Timothy Leary, praised
PACDAB's drug prevention center
for maintaining "a realtively
well-organized system of relevant
service delivery." Regarding the
center's staff, Cohen wrote that
"on the whole [it] is extremely
capable, responsible and
energetic."
PACDAB's other operation, a
residential treatment center
known as Unity House, did not
receive such approbation. The
evaluation cited the center's lack
of direction as the cause of its
ineffectiveness.
Although one evaluator called
Unity House "a troubled
program," Cohen commented that
it was too early to tell:
"Ultimately, the success or failure
of such programs rests on their
long term impact on residents. It
is obviously premature to evaluate
Unity House on such grounds."
Although a poll conducted by
the Daily showed that city council
members were generally in
agreement with the evaluation,
some of the councilmen were
critical of PACDAB's internal
structure and the radical political
stance of several of its board and
staff members.
Councilman John Berwald has
been one of the most outspoken
critics of the drug program's
collective system, in which board

members and staffers of the two
drug centers share equal
responsibility and authority, and
perform all jobs on a volunteer
basis.
Berwald charged that the
collective system suffered from "a
lack of direction and the mans to
achieve objective results."
"We call it passing the buck,"
Berwald said. "They call it a
collective system."
However, Claire Smith and
Mike Fox, staff workers at the
prevention center, insisted that
the collective system is not only
necessary but that it's the basis of
the drug program.
"If you're going to cure the
drug problem," Fox said, "you
have to go to the source of the
problem â€” capitalism. It's the
same source of racism, job
alienation, and the problems
women face."
Smith added, "Capitalism
needs repressing conditions like
blood for the body."
Fox and Smith maintained that
capitalism with its hierarchical
system forces the great majority
of non-rulers to relinquish control
over their lives. They claimed that
this loss of control becoms so
intense at the bottom of the
hierarchy that social problems like
drug abuse inevitably arise.
"We try to help people who
come to us to examine the forces
and factors that control their
lives, so that they can overcome
them," Fox said. Any other
system than collectivism would be
counter-productive to preventing
drug abuse because some people
would be controling others, Fox
insisted.
Several other staff members at
the prevention center, known as
the Collective, and a staff worker
at Unity House agreed with Fox's
and Smith's assessment of the
drug problem and said it formed
the basis for the center's method
of operation.
Stan Bettencourt, a board
member, said that the collective
system was not the unanimous

choice of the board, but that
"most board members go along
with it."
Councilman John Beahrs,
however, agreed with his colleague
Berwald and added that the
collective system was an
"undisciplined, unrealistic
approach to a sitation which
requires discipline." Not only did
PACDAB workers avoid internal
discipline, Beahrs said, they also
"resisted external discipline in the
form of the evaluation I by the
observation team from Martinez |,
which shows a lack of
confidence" on their part.
Mayor Kirke Comstock and
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum
both said that the collective
system "seems to be working."
Councilman Roy Clay said that
he had "no quarrel" with the
collective system, but he was
skeptical of its practicality.
"Leaders will emerge in any
system," Clay said, "and I suspect
that's what is happening there (in
PACDAB). Whether you identify
it as a collective in nature as
opposed to a hierarchy, in
practice there must be leaders and
followers."
Councilman Byron Sher said in
regard to PACDAB that he was
"not interested in method, only in
results." Sher agreed with Cohen
that any final judgment of
PACDAB now was premature. He
added, however, that the city
council will take "another hard
look" at the drug program next
spring when the city budget
comes up again.
Although Sher had no
complaints about PACDAB's
internal structure, he did question
whether the organization needed
an "anti-establishment political
philosophy" in order to maintain
its collective system.
He cited PACDAB's recent
inclusion, in a formal list of goals
and objectives, of "furthering the
form of collectivism in the
community" as an example of its
radical political stance. He added
that "it is generally known that

some staff members belonged to
(the now-defunct revolutionary
group | Venceremos" and that the
causes and organizations which
the Collective announces on its
public bulletin board "are not
generally supported in the
community."
"For the city to fund a program
which is costing it $220,000 a
year, it's important to have
widespread support," Sher said.
"Several people have expressed
their concerns to me about
PACDAB's anti-establishment
views, and there is a chance of
alienating the public." For any
drug program to work, Sher
insists, the community must
support it.
Fox disagreed with Sher's
charge about the Collective's

bulletin board, saying that if the
councilman came to the drug
prevention center at 418 Ramona
Streeet he would find a bulletin
board "typical of one on any
college campus."
Smith said that the Collective
encourages its clients to become
involved in activities "related to
struggles of other repressed
people" such as farm workers and
prison inmates. The choice of the
activity, however, is for the clients
to decide, she added.
Smith blamed the local press
for PACDAB's lack of widespread
community support. She said that
the community is generally
ignorant of the drug program's
operation and that the press
"blows up certain aspects which
feeds a reluctance in the

community to support
PACDAB."
The first-year evaluation
concurred with Smith's
assessment of the press coverage,
saying that the drug program "is
too often the subject of
misinformation or bad press."
Jay Thorwaldson, who has
covered PACDAB since its
inception for the Palo Alto Times,
agreed that "certain aspects and
incidents" were played up at the
expense of others in the local
newspapers. "But these are the
incidents which are breaking
news," Thorwaldson noted.
He cited the arrest of Fox at
the Collective in September,
1972, as an example of the types
of incidents which were

well-covered by the local press /
Fox was arrested on a Monday
night by a city policeman who
said he resembled an assault
suspect, according to
Thorwaldson. That same night,
"Collective staff members and a
contingent from Venceremos
stormed a city council meeting
and demanded Fox's release,"
Thorwaldson said.
Fox was released that night
and charges against him were
dropped, but several >112 the
council members were upset by
the disruptive methods and
name-calling of the PACDAB
workers, according to
Thorwaldson. "The councilmen
didn't enjoy being called
'fascist-pigs,' " he said.
