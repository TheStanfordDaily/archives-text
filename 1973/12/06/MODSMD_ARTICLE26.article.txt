# Man's Intellect ‘From The Gods'?
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"The trouble is that any
serious journalist hears about my
theories, and, because he is a
serious journalist, he consults a
serious scientist, say, an
astronomer," complains Erich von
Daniken.
The Swiss author of Chariots
of the Gods?, Gods Erom Outer
Space, and Gold of the Gods, sits
wolfing down corned beef and
cabbage in the Mirror Room of
San Erancisco's posh Press Club.
The short, stout zealot has sold 25
million books internationally
proposing that man's greatest gift,
his intellect, was given to him by
visitors from outside the galaxy
thousands of years ago.
Between mouthfuls of food,
von Daniken rattles off biblical
references and names of
archeological sites with machine
gun speed in defense of his
theories. The luncheon affords
few opportunities for cynical
journalists, since von Daniken
seems skilled in dodging cynical
questions.
Quizzed on a faulty biblical
quotation which he uses as
evidence that Sodom and
Gomorrah were destroyed by an
atomic bomb, von Daniken first
offers an answer unrelated to the
question, then a biblical passage as
erroneous as the one he is
defending.
Von Daniken dismisses all
opposition to his ideas by freely
admitting that in many instances
he may be wrong.
"The theory is absolutely
correct. It answers all the
questions. It is totally correct. But
there is no doubt that some of my
examples are wrong, and only
time will tell us which are wrong
and which are right. But the
theory itself is perfectly sound."
Indeed, there may be many
erroneous examples in von
Daniken's books. Dr. Clifford
Wilson of the University of South
Carolina, a former director of the
Australian Institute of

Archeology, has written a book
Crash Go The Chariots attacking
all of von Daniken's examples.
Von Daniken, however, does
not feel that traditional
archeology has gone far enough in
explaining the mysteries of the
ancient world. "Archeologists are
just like a locomotive. They are
fine as long as they can stay on
one set track, but without the
rails, they are worthless," he
argues.
One of von Daniken's most
famous exampels is the Plain of
Nasca in Peru. Nasca is covered
with mysterious grooves, some of
which run parallel while some
intersect in large criss-crosses.
Traditional archeology theorizes
that these lines were once Inca
roads. Von Daniken disagrees.
"Why would they build roads
that intersect so often, that lead
nowhere? I have never said it must
be an airfield. I have said it looks
like an airfield." Von Daniken
contends that astronauts from
another galaxy may have landed at
Nasca, making one of those lines
in the earth.
"As we know from the ancient
holy books, the gods always
promised to return. So perhaps
the Inca priests made more of the
sacred lines of the gods in the
hope that this would make the
gods return," von Daniken
theorizes.
In general, von Daniken does
not believe that visitors from
outer space have good intentions,
whether of ancient or modern
origins. "I have a bad feeling," he
muses. "Someone who is friendly
usually comes and introduces
himself."
Von Daniken believes that the
human race today may in fact be
the result of a eugenics
experiment started some 30,000
years ago by visitors from another
planet.
"In all the religious texts we
have the same story; that God
created man in his own image.
The one thing we can't answer is

why man, of all the primates,
should have something he doesn't
need — his intelligence.
"I'm not debating Darwin,"
von Daniken protests. "Our
skeleton, our bodies developed on
this planet." Von DAniken
explains that man was just like the
ape, an ignorant savage, until
visitors from space mated with
earth women, thereby creating
intelligent modern man.
"This is why we have all the
great sexual taboos of the ancient
religions. Adam and Eve could not
mate with others of their kinds,
perhaps because they were the
first intelligent life forms. To
mate with less intelligent creatures
would destroy the experiment,"
von Daniken contends.
Von Daniken explains tht men
from space would be likely to
create intelligent life because they
who would never be able to return
to their original planet, wanted
intelligent company on earth.
Von Daniken believes space
beings have visited earth three

times; once between 20,000 and
30,000 years ago; once in
approximately 5000 8.C.; and
once in 592 B.C. at the time when
the prophet Ezekiel saw the
burning wheels which von
Daniken is certain were space
ships.
Asked when earth could expect
the return of the gods from outer
space, Von Daniken says, "Now —
which could be tomorrow or 20
years from now." He contends
that the comet Kohoutek, which
is now visible from the earth, is a
normal comet and has no relation
to his theories.
However, Steve Thayer,
spokesman for the Terranautical
Society of Sausilito, states that his
group is seeking support from von
Daniken and the Von Daniken
Socieyt, a Canadian group, for an
expedition to the Plain of Nasca
to observe Kohoutek. It is from
the Terranautical Society that von
Daniken has received his only
official title — "archeologer"
rather than archeologist.

"Archeolotf/ste are those
people who are academically
certified as to their formal
education," explains Thayer. In
contrast, although von Daniken
claims to have studied his subject
for 23 years, none of his study has
been done in a university.
Von Daniken hopes to extend
his cause through a documentary
film which will be shown here
starting in January. The film is an
expanded version of what was
presented on the television
special. In Search of Ancient
Astronauts. Von Daniken also
hopes to raise funds for further
expeditions to what he calls
"mathematically logical points,"
where he believes "definitive
proof" may have been left for
man to uncover.
In the meanwhile, von Daniken
offers his advice to anyone who
encounters a man from outer
space. "Be peaceful at first." Then
he warns, in best surrender
fashion, "Throw up your arms'
like this."

"The trouble is that any
serious journalist hears about my
theories, and, because he is a
serious journalist, he consults a
serious scientist, say, an
astronomer," complains Erich von
Daniken.
The Swiss author of Chariots
of the Gods?, Gods Erom Outer
Space, and Gold of the Gods, sits
wolfing down corned beef and
cabbage in the Mirror Room of
San Erancisco's posh Press Club.
The short, stout zealot has sold 25
million books internationally
proposing that man's greatest gift,
his intellect, was given to him by
visitors from outside the galaxy
thousands of years ago.
Between mouthfuls of food,
von Daniken rattles off biblical
references and names of
archeological sites with machine
gun speed in defense of his
theories. The luncheon affords
few opportunities for cynical
journalists, since von Daniken
seems skilled in dodging cynical
questions.
Quizzed on a faulty biblical
quotation which he uses as
evidence that Sodom and
Gomorrah were destroyed by an
atomic bomb, von Daniken first
offers an answer unrelated to the
question, then a biblical passage as
erroneous as the one he is
defending.
Von Daniken dismisses all
opposition to his ideas by freely
admitting that in many instances
he may be wrong.
"The theory is absolutely
correct. It answers all the
questions. It is totally correct. But
there is no doubt that some of my
examples are wrong, and only
time will tell us which are wrong
and which are right. But the
theory itself is perfectly sound."
Indeed, there may be many
erroneous examples in von
Daniken's books. Dr. Clifford
Wilson of the University of South
Carolina, a former director of the
Australian Institute of

Archeology, has written a book
Crash Go The Chariots attacking
all of von Daniken's examples.
Von Daniken, however, does
not feel that traditional
archeology has gone far enough in
explaining the mysteries of the
ancient world. "Archeologists are
just like a locomotive. They are
fine as long as they can stay on
one set track, but without the
rails, they are worthless," he
argues.
One of von Daniken's most
famous exampels is the Plain of
Nasca in Peru. Nasca is covered
with mysterious grooves, some of
which run parallel while some
intersect in large criss-crosses.
Traditional archeology theorizes
that these lines were once Inca
roads. Von Daniken disagrees.
"Why would they build roads
that intersect so often, that lead
nowhere? I have never said it must
be an airfield. I have said it looks
like an airfield." Von Daniken
contends that astronauts from
another galaxy may have landed at
Nasca, making one of those lines
in the earth.
"As we know from the ancient
holy books, the gods always
promised to return. So perhaps
the Inca priests made more of the
sacred lines of the gods in the
hope that this would make the
gods return," von Daniken
theorizes.
In general, von Daniken does
not believe that visitors from
outer space have good intentions,
whether of ancient or modern
origins. "I have a bad feeling," he
muses. "Someone who is friendly
usually comes and introduces
himself."
Von Daniken believes that the
human race today may in fact be
the result of a eugenics
experiment started some 30,000
years ago by visitors from another
planet.
"In all the religious texts we
have the same story; that God
created man in his own image.
The one thing we can't answer is

why man, of all the primates,
should have something he doesn't
need — his intelligence.
"I'm not debating Darwin,"
von Daniken protests. "Our
skeleton, our bodies developed on
this planet." Von DAniken
explains that man was just like the
ape, an ignorant savage, until
visitors from space mated with
earth women, thereby creating
intelligent modern man.
"This is why we have all the
great sexual taboos of the ancient
religions. Adam and Eve could not
mate with others of their kinds,
perhaps because they were the
first intelligent life forms. To
mate with less intelligent creatures
would destroy the experiment,"
von Daniken contends.
Von Daniken explains tht men
from space would be likely to
create intelligent life because they
who would never be able to return
to their original planet, wanted
intelligent company on earth.
Von Daniken believes space
beings have visited earth three

times; once between 20,000 and
30,000 years ago; once in
approximately 5000 8.C.; and
once in 592 B.C. at the time when
the prophet Ezekiel saw the
burning wheels which von
Daniken is certain were space
ships.
Asked when earth could expect
the return of the gods from outer
space, Von Daniken says, "Now —
which could be tomorrow or 20
years from now." He contends
that the comet Kohoutek, which
is now visible from the earth, is a
normal comet and has no relation
to his theories.
However, Steve Thayer,
spokesman for the Terranautical
Society of Sausilito, states that his
group is seeking support from von
Daniken and the Von Daniken
Socieyt, a Canadian group, for an
expedition to the Plain of Nasca
to observe Kohoutek. It is from
the Terranautical Society that von
Daniken has received his only
official title — "archeologer"

von Daniken contends.
Von Daniken explains tht men
from space would be likely to
create intelligent life because they
who would never be able to return
to their original planet, wanted
intelligent company on earth.
Von Daniken believes space
beings have visited earth three

times; once between 20,000 and
30,000 years ago; once in
approximately 5000 8.C.; and
once in 592 B.C. at the time when
the prophet Ezekiel saw the
burning wheels which von
Daniken is certain were space
ships.
Asked when earth could expect
the return of the gods from outer
space, Von Daniken says, "Now —
which could be tomorrow or 20
years from now." He contends
that the comet Kohoutek, which
is now visible from the earth, is a
normal comet and has no relation
to his theories.
However, Steve Thayer,
spokesman for the Terranautical
Society of Sausilito, states that his
group is seeking support from von
Daniken and the Von Daniken
Socieyt, a Canadian group, for an
expedition to the Plain of Nasca
to observe Kohoutek. It is from
the Terranautical Society that von
Daniken has received his only
official title — "archeologer"
rather than archeologist.

"Archeolotf/ste are those
people who are academically
certified as to their formal
education," explains Thayer. In
contrast, although von Daniken
claims to have studied his subject
for 23 years, none of his study has
been done in a university.
Von Daniken hopes to extend
his cause through a documentary
film which will be shown here
starting in January. The film is an
expanded version of what was
presented on the television
special. In Search of Ancient
Astronauts. Von Daniken also
hopes to raise funds for further
expeditions to what he calls
"mathematically logical points,"
where he believes "definitive
proof" may have been left for
man to uncover.
In the meanwhile, von Daniken
offers his advice to anyone who
encounters a man from outer
space. "Be peaceful at first." Then
he warns, in best surrender
fashion, "Throw up your arms'
like this."

"The trouble is that any
serious journalist hears about my
theories, and, because he is a
serious journalist, he consults a
serious scientist, say, an
astronomer," complains Erich von
Daniken.
The Swiss author of Chariots
of the Gods?, Gods Erom Outer
Space, and Gold of the Gods, sits
wolfing down corned beef and
cabbage in the Mirror Room of
San Erancisco's posh Press Club.
The short, stout zealot has sold 25
million books internationally
proposing that man's greatest gift,
his intellect, was given to him by
visitors from outside the galaxy
thousands of years ago.
Between mouthfuls of food,
von Daniken rattles off biblical
references and names of
archeological sites with machine
gun speed in defense of his
theories. The luncheon affords
few opportunities for cynical
journalists, since von Daniken
seems skilled in dodging cynical
questions.
Quizzed on a faulty biblical
quotation which he uses as
evidence that Sodom and
Gomorrah were destroyed by an
atomic bomb, von Daniken first
offers an answer unrelated to the
question, then a biblical passage as
erroneous as the one he is
defending.
Von Daniken dismisses all
opposition to his ideas by freely
admitting that in many instances
he may be wrong.
"The theory is absolutely
correct. It answers all the
questions. It is totally correct. But
there is no doubt that some of my
examples are wrong, and only
time will tell us which are wrong
and which are right. But the
theory itself is perfectly sound."
Indeed, there may be many
erroneous examples in von
Daniken's books. Dr. Clifford
Wilson of the University of South
Carolina, a former director of the
Australian Institute of

Archeology, has written a book
Crash Go The Chariots attacking
all of von Daniken's examples.
Von Daniken, however, does
not feel that traditional
archeology has gone far enough in
explaining the mysteries of the
ancient world. "Archeologists are
just like a locomotive. They are
fine as long as they can stay on
one set track, but without the
rails, they are worthless," he
argues.
One of von Daniken's most
famous exampels is the Plain of
Nasca in Peru. Nasca is covered
with mysterious grooves, some of
which run parallel while some
intersect in large criss-crosses.
Traditional archeology theorizes
that these lines were once Inca
roads. Von Daniken disagrees.
"Why would they build roads
that intersect so often, that lead
nowhere? I have never said it must
be an airfield. I have said it looks
like an airfield." Von Daniken
contends that astronauts from
another galaxy may have landed at
Nasca, making one of those lines
in the earth.
"As we know from the ancient
holy books, the gods always
promised to return. So perhaps
the Inca priests made more of the
sacred lines of the gods in the
hope that this would make the
gods return," von Daniken
theorizes.
In general, von Daniken does
not believe that visitors from
outer space have good intentions,
whether of ancient or modern
origins. "I have a bad feeling," he
muses. "Someone who is friendly
usually comes and introduces
himself."
Von Daniken believes that the
human race today may in fact be
the result of a eugenics
experiment started some 30,000
years ago by visitors from another
planet.
"In all the religious texts we
have the same story; that God
created man in his own image.
The one thing we can't answer is

why man, of all the primates,
should have something he doesn't
need — his intelligence.
"I'm not debating Darwin,"
von Daniken protests. "Our
skeleton, our bodies developed on
this planet." Von DAniken
explains that man was just like the
ape, an ignorant savage, until
visitors from space mated with
earth women, thereby creating
intelligent modern man.
"This is why we have all the
great sexual taboos of the ancient
religions. Adam and Eve could not
mate with others of their kinds,
perhaps because they were the
first intelligent life forms. To
mate with less intelligent creatures
would destroy the experiment,"
von Daniken contends.
