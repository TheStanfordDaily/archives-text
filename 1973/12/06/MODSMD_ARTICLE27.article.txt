# "Dynamic' Dan Drew Waits His Turn To Teach
## New Prof Brings Years Of Experience 
### EZRA GREENHOUSE 
"Step back! This thing has
been bothering me all morning."
Asst. Communications Prof.
Dan Drew is trying to swat a fly in
his office. His slightly awkward
but powerful movement recalls his
days as a college wrestler, when he
spent much of his time looking
over an opponent's shoulder at
the ceiling.
There is nothing methodical in
his style. A lover of the chase.
Drew will be happy if his
magazine is battle-scarred and a
few paperclips are knocked off
the desk.
As he prepares to administer
the coup de grace, he raises his

eyebrows and grins slyly. He is
Nelson Eddy, plus mustache and
eyeglasses, trying to imitate
Groucho Marx. His dimples betray
him. So do his blue eyes and
tousled blond hair. The
metamorphosis is ineffective but
sincere. He has similar success
with the fly.
Conceding defeat, he centers
himself above his chair and lets
gravity take over. The child who
always broke things.
Drew has been stirring the
world into motion for most of his
32 years. Before coming to
Stanford he worked more than 10
years in radio and television
journalism. While in graduate

school at the University of
Indiana he was offered the news
directorship of WHAM, a
50,000-watt station in Rochester,
N.Y. He declinded, choosing
instead to begin a less lucrative
doctoral program.
"I was fed up with the changes
that took place in radio news .. .
the pressure to be 'witty,' to give
every story a funny, ironical
twist." His voice moves easily
between a conversational tone,
and a broadcast voice that seems
to originate somewhere slightly
above his breakfast. Often, he
slides into the resonant bass at the
beginning of a sentence, surfacing
only towards the period.
"I had worked two and a half
years at WWDC (Washington,
D.C.] when AVCO, the defense
contractor, bought the
station.. ..
"The news reporting
degenerated ... I began asking
myself why we covered certain
events . . . why we did things
merely because other stations
were doing them."
Drew's face shows no strain
from his manifold radio chores —
reporter, engineer, disc jockey,
weatherman, broadcaster, feature
reporter, traffic-control helicopter
reporter. However, his
youthfulness masks a serious
concern with journalism.
He recalls when the owner of a
pizza parlor, an advertiser on
WWDC, called the station to ask
that a robbery at his
establishment not be reported.
Drew, suppressing an urge to jump
through the phone, replied
casually, "Well why don't you
listen to my 2:30 newscast,
because I plan to make the
robbery my lead story."
Characteristically, his anger

caused him to report the robbery
in greater detail than World War
111 would have required.
But Drew's interest in
journalism is theoretical as well as
visceral. He believes that "slick
writing" and interviewing are
replacing solid reporting. "1 would
rather see a piece that was poorly
written and well researched, than
one well written and misleading."
Drew's office, a styrofoam
confessinal in Redwood Hall,
contains rather than houses him.
To make the closeness more
appropriate, or to open a window
on more pleasant surroundings, he
has pasted on the wall a poster of
an airplane cockpit.
Drew has been flying a real
airplane for 10 years. When he
worked in Baltimore in the early
1960s he says he took flying
lessons every time he "got six
bucks ahead." In 1972, when he
could resist no longer, he
purchased a single-engine 1940
Piper Cub. He exchanged it for a
1955 model six years later. Ever
the intrepid pilot, he had neither
radio nor lights on his first plane.
Before he began graduate
school in Indiana, Drew and his
wife flew from Washington to
Alaska, a month-long camping trip
that followed the Alcan Highway
over and around the Canadian
Rockies.
While Drew was studying
journalism, his wife Sally was
obtaining her masters degree in
library science. She works in the
Redwood City library system.
She says that Drew had been
complaining that they had not
seen or done enough on the West
Coast. Sally, a tempering
influence, patiently explained that

they had been in California only a
few weeks.
Drew's love of the outdoors
perhaps contrasts with the more
restricted life of a radio journalist,
and now a professor. He
compensates somewhat by riding
his bicycle the six-mile roundtrip
between home and school, and by
jogging regularly. He also
compensates by his effervescence
in Redwood Hall.
He appears occasionally in
Redwood Library. Invariably, he
pauses at the door, leans on the
frame, and plans the order of his
acknowledgements. Then, he
walks silently and quickly to his
objective, rendering a fraternal
slap here and there, and a
friendly, audibly whispered
admonition — "read that stuff
before you come to class."
Without stopping for a reply, he
takes what he needs and is gone.
Communication Prof. Don
Dodson says that Drew "insists on
being free ... on not letting the
job restrict him."
Describing him as "dynamic"
and "engaging," Dodson says he
envies Drew's ability to cope with
the problems of a beginning
professor. In particular, Dodson
admires his determination to
handle administrative and
departmental pressures in order to
be an effective instructor.
Teaching his one course this
term with one of the tenured
professors, Drew is presently
doing more listening than
teaching. Most days, he sits
patiently, waiting for his
opportunity to lecture. He drums
his fingers on the table. He chafes
mildly. He looks out at the class,
sees someone, sees nothing ... is
flying his airplane.
