# University Reports On Affirmative Action Progress

University Newsservice
About one-quarter of all new
Stanford faculty appointments,
and more than four-fifths of the
total University hires last year
were members of racial minorities
and/or women, according to a
report, Affirmative Action at
Stanford, published yesterday.
For the University staff
excluding faculty, 22 percent of
the 863 new hires last year were
of racial minorities, compared to

18 percent of the 728
terminations. (About 18 percent
of the present 6000 University
employees are members of
minority groups.)
About 12 percent of the 299
new hires in the federally defined
categories of officials and
managers, administrative
assistants, and professionals were
minorities. About one-third of the
new hires in these three categories
are women. About one in five of

those were women from racial
minorities.
Of all the new hires last year,
61 percent were minority and
nonminority women. (48 percent
of the total work force is female.)
The largest proportion of female
hires was in the category of office
and clerical workers, where 362 of
the 393 new hires were women.
The data from which these
statistics were drawn is most
reliable for describing major shifts
in employment patterns and less
reliable for small changes. Part of
last year's affirmative action work
was to build a better data base for
future evaluation of the program's
progress.
In the area of faculty
affirmative action, reported to the
Faculty Senate last month, 18
women, 3 blacks, 2 Asian
Americans (one, a woman), and
one native American were
appointed out of a total of 90
new professorial appointments.
Of these, 4 women (one, an
Asian American), one native
American, and one black were
appointed to tenured positions
(associate or full professor).
Among the developments of
the University's affirmative action
program listed in the report are:
in staff employment
policies and procedures intended
to provide tools for equaJ
opportunity, including job
posting, a minimum recruiting
period, and review of proposed
criteria for qualificaitons and
testing procedures.
*A job classification and
compensation uniform
classification were virtually
completed.
* Recruiting efforts were
developed and extended
*Maternity leave was reviewed
and revised so that childbirth
leave (for which accumulated sick
leave may be used) is now
available to all employees, with
the same or a similar job assured
at the end of the leave in most

circumstances. Both male and
female employees may also
request, though they are not
guaranteed, infant care leave for a
period of up to six months.
Perhaps the major addition to
staff affirmative action during
1972-73 was the appointment of
affirmative action coordinators in
specific areas to assist line officers
in their responsibilities.
"Changes in the composition
of the work force, in the final
analysis, come down to individual
action by managers and
supervisors in day-to-day
employment action: hiring
decisions, promotion decisions,
job classification, and career
development," the report
observes.
All these changes and
innovations are important in
helping to improve the
University's long-range ability to
carry out its policies over the next
five years, the report emphasizes.
Affirmative action staff
priorities for the 1973-74
academic years, also outlined in
the report, are:
♦Increased attention to
searchers for senior jobs;
♦Efforts to increase upward
mobility for present employees,
particularly for those who are
racial minorities and women; and
♦Improvement of methods for
estimating availability of and for
recruiting minority craftsmen, and
female laborers, operatives, and
craftsmen.
Two new administrative panels
were created this year to focus on
affirmative action. The Internal
Affirmative \ Action panel will
advise Presidnet Richard W.
Lyman on both staff and faculty
affirmative action policies and
programs.
The External Affirmative
Action Panel monitors efforts by
the University to influence the
employment and hiring practices
of its suppliers and contractors.
External affirmative action last

year concentrated on the
construction area, the University's
largest near-term commitment of
resources.
Stanford's Construction and
Engineering Office has developed
a comprehensive equal
employment opportunity
program, legally binding, from
invitation to bid through
completion of construction.
In 197 2-73, minority
employment on University
construction increased from
approximately 25 percent to 39
percent, and there was a marked
improvement in the minority
representation of journeymen in
the mechanical and electrical
trades. The panel is studying
problems in the current program
and possible solutions to them.
On the faculty side, the
principal developments included:
*Attention to the
thoroughness of search
procedures, and revision of the
procedure manual to give detailed
guidance to committees on
appointment and promotion of
faculty.
*A re-statement on part-time
tenure that notes this as an option
for appointment of regular faculty
members to either tenure or
nontenured positions.
♦Reaffirmation of University
policy on appointment of close
relatives to specify that there are
no bars to appointment of close
realtives to the faculty as long as
they meet the standards applied
to all faculty appointees.
Priorities for 1973-74 in
faculty affirmative action were
specified as follows:
♦Continued improvement of
search and selection procedures;
♦Special attention to
improving the University's ability
to identify chicano faculty
members, of whom there were no
new appointees this year; and
♦Analysis of the position of
research associates.
The report's introducing

includes a statistical profile of
minorities and women at
Stanford. In the fall of 1972, 637
minority students constituted 9.9
percent of the undergraduate
enrollment. Included were 294
blacks, 296 chicanos, 47 native
Americans, and 314 Asian
Americans.
At the graduate level, there
were about 400 black and chicano
students, 22 native Americans,
and an estimated 100 Asian
Americans.
Last year the University moved
to eliminate a clause in Stanford's
founding grant which restricted
the proportion of women students

to 40 percent of the total student
population.
In March the Santa Clara
County Superior Court removed
the amendments to the grant, and
the trustee resolution of 1933 was
rescinded, making it technically
final that no quota exists for
admission of women and that sex
is not a factor in the admission
process.
From 1965 to 1971 the
University's undergraduate
enrollment increased 10 percent.
Men's enrollment dropped by 1
percent while women's enrollment
increased 36 percent.
