# Big Daddy's Meals Help Relief Drive
## 
### DON COX 
"Big Daddy" Dave McCullum,
Faculty Club chef, said yesterday
that the drive to raise funds for
the African Relief Fund by selling
home-delivered meals was
progressing "beautifully" and had
netted $4,115 to date.
Though they had been
originally "shooting for $25,000,"
McCullum said that he would "be
very happy if they got $5,000."
"I'm so happy I can hardly sit
still," said McCullum. "I really
didn't expect it to work out this
well."
The meal program, part of the
drive sponsored locally by the
ASSU and the Black Students
Union, will continue through next
week.
McCullum said response has
been very good as testified to by
the large number of reorders.
"We've had some complaints
about the food being late and cold
but this was due to a shortage of
manpower," said Charles Ogletree,
ASSU vice president and drive
organizer. More help has been
hired, he added.
"Some have complained about
the amount of food in the dinner.
The dinner was never intended to
be filling but just a small dinner to

allow us to give something for a
contribution to the fund," said
Ogletree.
Ogletree said he "was
disappointed with the lack of
faculty supporting the endeavor."
The apparent success of the
meal program in the African
Relief drive might lead to its
utilization in drives for the Black
Students Cultural Center and
scholarships, Ogletree said.
The organizers of the relief
fund plan to set up a stand in
White Plaza tomorrow to sell
African novelties to supplement
the drive.
The money raised is to be
deposited in a trust fund to be
turned over to the national
African Famine Relief Fund. The
money will then be used to supply
needy people in drought-stricken
areas of Africa.
To order meals, one may call
322-5794 before each evening.
Meals will then be delivered to the
consumer's home at a specified
time between 9 p.m. and
midnight. Southern fried chicken,
barbeque ribs, and shack fried fish
are the featured entrees, with
french fries and cole slaw supplied
with each meal. Cost of a meal is
$1.50.
