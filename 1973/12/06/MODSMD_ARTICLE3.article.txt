# ‘Daily’ Ad Sales Short Of Mark

Daily officials said this week that although the paper is
currently "financially comfortable," advertising revenues
for the current fiscal year will probably fall well short of
previously projected figures.
Editor Jim Wascher and Business Manager Mike Kruger
estimated that local display advertising, the paper's largest
single source of income, will total about $100,000 this
year, approximately the same amount as last year. Earlier
estimates placed the figure at $150,000, which was revised
downward to $115,000 at the beginning of the school
year.
Kruger blamed the revised figures on several factors —
including over-optimistic original projections, the general
economic situation, and the fact that the paper may have
reached the "natural limit" of the local advertising
market.
According to Kruger, the paper may run at a slight
operating deficit this year. However, the Daily's cash
reserves — some $28,000, most of it accumulated over the
last three years — will be more than enough to offset any
loss.
Last year, the paper had about a $15,000 surplus that

was put into the cash reserves. Kruger noted, however,
that the $15,000 was only about $3000 more than the
difference between the $22,000 the Daily received in
student fees last year and the $10,000 it will receive this
year.
Besides lower-than-expected sales, Kruger noted that
costs have risen slightly more than expected. "We had
projected a seven percent increase in revenues and a three
percent increase in costs. Instead, revenues have remained
about the same as last year, and costs have risen about five
percent." He also forecast another slight rise in costs
before the end of the year.
Part of the cost increase came from Wascher's decision
to establish a six-page per day minimum for the Daily
whether or not enough ads had been sold to pay for it.
Wascher explained that he banned four-page papers
because "editorially, they are so small as to be not
acceptable, and businesswise they are not saleable." He
said this policy would continue "at least until the end of
my volume [the end of January], and hopefully into the
indefinite future."
'Dollars Out The Door'
Kruger said that while he agreed with Wascher's
decision, it was possible that "come winter [ traditionally
the slowest quarter in advertising), we may be shipping
dollars out the door" with many issues.
The situation may become even more acute if the
projected recession occurs. "The college ad dollar is one
of the first things to be shut off" in a recession, Kruger
said. He added that ads from gas stations and airlines have
already fallen off sharply since the energy pinch.
The paper's financial health took on added importance
last Feb. 1 when the Daily officially cut its ties with the
ASSU and established itself as the Stanford Daily
Publishing Corp., a non-profit California corporation.
Independence meant several changes for the Daily,
including phasing out support from student fee
assessments and from the University to print extra copies
for faculty and staff.
During the current school year, the paper will receive
about $10,000 from its one-quarter, $1 student fee
assessment. In addition, the Daily will take in $16,500 for
faculty-staff copies both this year and next year.
Projections established by previous Daily officials
called for the paper to subsist solely off ad revenues by
the 1975-76 school year. Wascher and Kruger, while
sticking by that prediction, admitted that the paper could
have to go back for another student fee assessment in
1975 — despite statements by the previous officials that
1973-74 would be the last assessment.
"As a matter of fact, I don't know of any serious
newspaper that exists only from advertising revenue and is
distributed free," Kruger said. He added that
"philosophically," he was not opposed to the concept of
"students paying something for the paper, maybe only $1
or $1.50 a year as opposed to the $3 or $4" assessments
of previous years.
'Not Adverse'
Wascher too added that he was "not adverse" to
charging students $1 a year for the paper, but that he
recognized that students had previously been told there

would be no further assessments.
He said the Daily was still shooting for its target of
self-sufficiency, but that "it won't be as easy as the
projections make it appear."
Because of the somewhat uncertain financial future,
Kruger contended, "more sources of revenue have got to
be found." The Daily has already branched out to a
certain extent with special weekend football and
basketball issues and "theme issue" supplements to the
regular Daily organized around specific topics such as
skiing and photography.
Additional Revenues
Krugei said that football issues this year brought the
paper an additional $1500, and that the six planned
theme issues would bring in about $350 profit each (the
first — on skiing — appeared two weeks ago). The
basketball issues are expected to break even this year, but
next year ought to match the football issues in revenue,
Kruger said.
Such special projects will be undertaken "as long as
they don't interfere with the regular Daily, although I
don't see why they should," said Wascher.
Some problems that arose during production of the
first theme issue will be alleviated before the next one,
Wascher said. He blamed much of the problem to a lack of
time to prepare the issue, and said that there would be
more time and better preparation for the next issue.
In the future, he said, the theme issues will be assigned
to individual editorial staff members with an interest in
the field. The staffers will oversee editorial content, while
the business office will sell ads to firms related to the
issue's topic.
In all, said Kruger, the special projects would seldom
exceed five percent of the paper's revenues in a year —
"but that's a critical five percent that could mean the
difference between a small profit and an operating
deficit."
