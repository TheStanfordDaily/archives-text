# ‘Daily’ Ad Sales Short Of Mark

Daily officials said this week that although the paper is
currently "financially comfortable," advertising revenues
for the current fiscal year will probably fall well short of
previously projected figures.
Editor Jim Wascher and Business Manager Mike Kruger
estimated that local display advertising, the paper's largest
single source of income, will total about $100,000 this
year, approximately the same amount as last year. Earlier
estimates placed the figure at $150,000, which was revised
downward to $115,000 at the beginning of the school
year.
Kruger blamed the revised figures on several factors —
including over-optimistic original projections, the general
economic situation, and the fact that the paper may have
reached the "natural limit" of the local advertising
market.
According to Kruger, the paper may run at a slight
operating deficit this year. However, the Daily's cash
reserves — some $28,000, most of it accumulated over the
last three years — will be more than enough to offset any
loss.
Last year, the paper had about a $15,000 surplus that

was put into the cash reserves. Kruger noted, however,
that the $15,000 was only about $3000 more than the
difference between the $22,000 the Daily received in
student fees last year and the $10,000 it will receive this
year.
Besides lower-than-expected sales, Kruger noted that
costs have risen slightly more than expected. "We had
projected a seven percent increase in revenues and a three
percent increase in costs. Instead, revenues have remained
about the same as last year, and costs have risen about five
percent." He also forecast another slight rise in costs
before the end of the year.
Part of the cost increase came from Wascher's decision
to establish a six-page per day minimum for the Daily
whether or not enough ads had been sold to pay for it.
Wascher explained that he banned four-page papers
because "editorially, they are so small as to be not
acceptable, and businesswise they are not saleable." He
said this policy would continue "at least until the end of
my volume [the end of January], and hopefully into the
indefinite future."
'Dollars Out The Door'
Kruger said that while he agreed with Wascher's
decision, it was possible that "come winter [ traditionally
