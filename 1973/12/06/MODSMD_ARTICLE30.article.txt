Police Arrest Blockading Truckers
Riot-equipped Ohio police arrested five truckers
yesterday as the police forcibly removed some highway
blockades set up to protest against higher fuel prices and
lower speed limits.
Most truckers voluntarily moved their rigs as the
highway patrol, backed by National Guard tow trucks,
cleared about 300 vehicles from feeder roads near
Interstate 70 east of Columbus.
About 700 truckers kept Interstate 70 closed east of
Columbus and 1000 others closed a 112-mile stretch of
the Ohio Turnpike across the northern part of the state.
A spokesman for Gov. John J. Gilligan said it would
not be practical to tow away so many trucks from the
interstate highways.
Meanwhile, truckers vowed to end their blockades in
Pennsylvania following a threat of National Guard action
by Gov. Milton Shapp. New Jersey Gov. William Cahill
also vowed to use the National Guard to clear any further
blockades.
In Washington, federal officials moved to mollify the
truckers. Transportation Secretary Claude S. Brinegar
called for an end to the disruptions and announced an
investigation of possible price gouging on truck fuel and a
review of the allocation of fuel supplies at truck stops.
In Ohio, the process of clearing the feeder roads to 1-70
began after state officials told truckers to move out by 6
p.m. PDT or face arrest.
Shortly after the deadline about 50 Ohio highway
patrolmen approached an intersection blocked by 50
trucks. The truckers moved away peacefully.
Heating Oil Price Hike Approved
WASHINGTON — The government yesterday
authorized a two-cents-a-gallon increase in the price of
home heating oil in an effort to increase production of the
fuel.
The Cost of Living Council simultaneously ordered a
one-cent decrease in the price of gasoline at the refinery
level.
Meanwhile, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, Sheik
Ahmen Zaki Yamani, said his government would be
willing to relax its oil embargo to this country in phased
steps with Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands.

Yamani met with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
and later told newsmen, "If Israel decides to withdraw and
agrees to a timetable there could be a timetable to relax
the embargo."
Consumers will begin paying the extra two cents a
gallon for home heating oil in January. But they probably
will not see any price decrease in gasoline at the pump
because of other increased costs in producing gasoline.
Gas Kationin<£ Coupons Transferable?
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's energy advisers,
considering proposals to ration gasoline, are leaning
toward a plan in which coupons would be transferable and
have value like money.
The proposal, dubbed the "white market" by
government planners, could be combined with a stiff
increase in the federal gasoline tax or stand alone as a
coupon system.
Sources said the transferable-coupon idea now tops the
list of proposals should President Nixon decide that
gasoline rationing is necessary. They emphasized that no
final decision on rationing has been made.
The new energy czar, William E. Simon, is known to
favor a combination of the transferable-coupon idea and a
gasoline tax to cut consumer demand for gasoline.
UdLA's Rodders Switches Teams

Rodgers, a 1954 Tech graduate, accepted the
appointment by long distance telephone from Los
Angeles, the spokesman said.
