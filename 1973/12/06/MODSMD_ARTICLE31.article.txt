# Amsterdam To Get ACLU Award
## 
### 
Anthony Amsterdam, professor of
law here, will be the recipient of the
first annual Earl Warren Award,
presented by the American Civil
Liberties Union of Northern California
(ACLUNC).
"Amsterdam has been chosen for
the award in recognition of his
outstanding contributions to civil
liberties," explained Tom Layton,
associate director of the ACLUNC.
"His whole life is a monument to civil
liberties."
The presentation of the award, a
bronze casting, will be held on
Sunday, Dec. 16 at 7:30 p.m. at the
Geary Theater in San Francisco, and
former U.S. Supreme Court Chief
Justice Earl Warren will be present.
Washington journalist I.F. Stone will

deliver a speech on the constitutional
crisis currently facing the nation.
Amsterdam successfully argued
Fuhrman v. Georgia in front of the
U.S. Supreme Court in the summer of
1972. In a landmark decision in the
case, the court held that capital
punishment as it was then applied in
the nation constituted cruel and
unusual punishment, in violation of
the Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution. All state laws regulating
capital punishment were struck down
as a result of the ruling.
"We have been planning to establish
an award for a long while," Layton
said. "We finally found the time to
start one, and Amsterdam is the logical
person to be its first recipient. He is an
unbelievable guy."
