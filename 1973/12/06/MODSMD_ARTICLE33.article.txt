# Charter Fliers Can't Sell Parts Of Tickets

Students who purchase one-way or
ound-trip tickets on ASSU charter
lights from other students may be
jarred from boarding those flights by
ederal regulations, warns Travel
Service Manager Terry Hess.
"It has come to our attention that
iome students are trying to sell half
portions of their charter flight tickets.
Perhaps the parties involved don't
realize that 'split charters' are now
illegal: all ticket-holders must pay
round-trip fares," he said.
According to the rules, only those
passengers whose names appear on the
charter manifest are legally entitled to
take the flight. "We don't know how
stringent the airlines involved will be,"
observed Hess, "but they are entitled
to check every passenger for some I.D.
and many do.
"In the past students have been
refused boarding; I think students who
are trying to buy these tickets should
be warned that they may be out both
their rides and their money if the
airlines are checking," he added.
Hess also announced that the
rescheduled charter flight to New
York, which is now set to leave from
Oakland at 7:45 p.m. on Dec. 14, has
been sold out.
A TWA strike forced the travel
service to switch the flight to a larger
World Airlines plane, but Hess said
that all the extra seats on the plane
have been sold in slightly over a week.
He cited "good publicity" for the
quick sales, and noted that the

departure time for the return flight
from New York will be 12 noon, an
"unusually reasonable hour."
Airport buses will leave from in
front of Tresidder Union about two
hours before each scheduled ASSU
flight, according to Hess.
Round-trip tickets on the buses
should be available by this afternoon;
they will cost $2.50 for charter flight
ticket holders. "The tickets are priced
at below the cost to us," said Hess.
"We're running the buses as a service,
and they should be especially useful
because of the energy crisis." Tickets
will also be available to those planning
to board other flights priced at $3.50
one-way and $5 round-trip.
Buyers will be able to pick up their
charter flight tickets this afternoon.
