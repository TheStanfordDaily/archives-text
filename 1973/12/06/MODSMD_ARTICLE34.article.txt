# Flicks To Require ID Proving Age
## 
### 
The ASSU Sunday Flicks will
require everyone attending Easy Rider
this Sunday to present either a
Stanford student body card or
identification proving their age, Flicks
Manager Bob Sisson announced
Tuesday.
"We will not admit any
non-students under 18 years of age
this Sunday unless they are
accompanied by an adult. And
everyone will be carded," Sisson said.
He blamed the move on "a great
deal of rowdiness and a number of
complaints" about audience behavior
at the Flicks the last two weeks.
"We think it's just a small segment
of our audience and we are trying to
screen them out," he added.
Although the Flicks adopted the
age restrictions last school year, they
have rarely been enforced.
Signs will be posted this Sunday
informing Flicks patrons of the
regulations.
