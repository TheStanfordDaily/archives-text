# Action To Relieve Shortage Slow
## 500 Students Lack P.O. Boxes 
### KATHY CUNNINGHAM 
About the only thing slower than
the U.S. mail these days is the action
being taken to alleviate the shortage of
post office boxes at Stanford.
Several hundred students are denied
mail service each year because of
inadequate facilities at the Stanford
Post Office and slow action by the
University and the U.S. Postal Service.
About 500 students living in
residences where no mail is delivered
were unable to rent boxes at the
Stanford branch early this quarter
because the 5300 boxes were already
taken.
Information published by the
registrar's office in October showed
that approximately 1350 boxes were
rented by non-students. The majority
of these were rented by faculty
members who can receive mail at their
homes.
Post
Office regulations state a box must be
rented to any individual who requests
one.
About 2300 boxes were rented to
students living in residences that
receive postal service, leaving only
1500 boxes for the 2017 students in
Toyon, Wilbur, Branner, Florence
Moore, Lagunita and Roble, where,
because of an arrangement between
the University and the Director of
Collection and Delivery Services in San
Francisco, there is no mail delivery.
Students Scheme
Most of these students have
arranged to have their mail sent to the
box of a roommate or friend, and
because the Post Office delivers only

to the name on the lease, they have
schemed with parents and friends to
address envelopes to the person legally
renting the box, but with a special sign
that earmarks their letters.
According to Walter Findeisen,
University recorder, the absence of a
legitimate mailing address for all
students is a big problem for the
registrar's office, whose sole means of
communication is through the mail. It
has no way of sending study lists and
counseling information to the student.
In addition, official government

communications, such as sample
ballots and letters from legislators, do
not reach the student.
Ellen Lautz, former director of
Roble Hall, who investigated postal
operations on campus last year, said
the current system of selective delivery
has evolved more by custom than for
logical reasons.
Mail is delivered to Stern, Crothers,
and Crothers Memorial because they
have locked boxes in the building.
These dorms were built in 1949 when
the Post Office faced a similar box

shortage, so the Post Office paid for
their installation. When Mirrielees was
built in 1970, boxes were installed
anticipating another shortage at the
main postal facility.
No Agreement
In these four cases, the University
arranged for delivery with the
Sectional Post Office in San Francisco
at the time they were built. Because
no boxes were installed in the six
other dorms, no agreement for
delivery was negotiated with the
Sectional Collection and Delivery
facility.
Mail delivered to the University
with insufficient address is routed to
Armista Cook in the registrar's office,
who uses an up-to-date student
directory to readdress all first-class
mail. When no mailing address is
available, letters are returned to the
sender. Mail is not sent to dorms that
do not receive mail from the Post
Office.
In May 1972, 400 to 500 sample
ballots addressed to Stanford students
at their University residences, not
mailing addresses, were destroyed by
Post Office employees. The ballots
were sent third-class, so they were
"properly handled in that respect,"
according to Palo Alto Postmaster
James Hodgen. He added, however,
that "this was poor judgment on our
part even though we may have been
technically right."
At that time George Mann, registrar
of voters for Santa Clara County, said,
"Stanford is a real problem as far as
mail is concerned." Students had

shortage which, apparently, is destined to continue for several years.
registered at a residence address for
precinct placement purposes, but
because of the ballot destruction,
Mann's office has changed its mailing
procedures for Stanford to include
box numbers and not residences.
Problem Unsolved
However, the problem for students
with no mailing address remains
unsolved. The University has received
many letters from parents who have
no way of corresponding with their
sons and daughters. When they write
in care of the dorm, their letters are
returned or lost. As one father said,
"There is something missing in the
mail handling on campus."
The most obvious solution would
seem to be direct delivery to all
dormitories, but there are legal and
financial obstacles. Several dorm
directors have recommended box
installation in the individual houses,
and Associate Dean of Students Larry
Horton has suggested the crunch could
be relieved if boxes were put into only
one of the six complexes. In view of
the high cost of boxes — estimated at
$10 per student — he believes this is a

more realistic proposal.
Legally however, delivery to each
dorm is not possible. According to
G.A. Alasia, manager of the San
Francisco METRO Center, the Post
Office adopted a policy in March,
1972 that mail will not be delivered to
University mail boxes in college dorms
because it interferes with the Postal
Service responsibilities "to maintain an
efficient system of collecting, sorting
and delivery of the mail nationwide."
Alasia said it would be impossible
to keep a current directory of every
student residing in dormitories, so the
most efficient mail service is through
boxes in the Stanford Post Office
branch.
Mail will continue to be delivered
to all other University housing,
however, because of arrangements
made before the 1972 ruling.
Expensive Idea r
One student's suggestion is to have
the mail delivered in bulk "just like
they do in a big hotel" to the dorm
offices. This would require hiring
someone to daily sort and deliver mail.
According to Alan Cummings,
manager of residences and fraternities,

the housing office doesn't have the
money to staff that position.
Most dorm directors believe the
possibility of theft and loss make it
inadvisable to have mail delivered bulk
and just left on a general table for
students to pick up themselves. Ellen
Lautz, who surveyed dorm
administration staffs, said, "Overall,
this was felt to be an untenable
solution."
Lautz believes the most reasonable
solution would be to expand the White
Plaza Post Office to provide space for
additional boxes. There is no room for
more boxes outside the building, but
Page Pointer, supervisor of the
Stanford Post Office, submitted a
proposal in January, 1973 to extend
the front of the building 15 feet.
Pointer saicl this would make room for
approximately 900 more boxes.
Long Wait
The proposal has been accepted by
Postmaster Hodjgen and is in San
Francisco awaiting approval. But,
Pointer said, it may be several years
before a decision is made because the
Postal Service is currently building
large bulk man centers tnat are

receiving top priority
Although requests for expansion
are generally accepted by the Post
Office engineering department,
approval by the San Francisco office
does not give Pointer the green light to
build. Because the University owns the
land and building occupied by the Post
Office, modification and expansion
must be approved by Dan DeYoung,
director of Plant Services.
But DeYoung said he is optimistic
about approval of the expansion plans.
"It's just a matter of time," he added.
The project has been handed over
to Michael Korff, a graduate student
who works in the Dean of Student
Affairs office, but little or no action is
being taken because it is "not a
priority project," according to Horton.
Lautz calls the project "an
orphan," — no one wants to tackle it
because it's such a "circular issue."
She feels Stanford is dragging its feet
and should pressure the San Francisco
Sectional Post Office to act
immediately on the building extension
proposal. "The University needs to
take the bull by the horns and get the
whole thing done with."

About the only thing slower than
the U.S. mail these days is the action
being taken to alleviate the shortage of
post office boxes at Stanford.
Several hundred students are denied
mail service each year because of
inadequate facilities at the Stanford
Post Office and slow action by the
University and the U.S. Postal Service.
About 500 students living in
residences where no mail is delivered
were unable to rent boxes at the
Stanford branch early this quarter
because the 5300 boxes were already
taken.
Information published by the
registrar's office in October showed
that approximately 1350 boxes were
rented by non-students. The majority
of these were rented by faculty
members who can receive mail at their
homes.
Post
Office regulations state a box must be
rented to any individual who requests
one.
About 2300 boxes were rented to
students living in residences that
receive postal service, leaving only
1500 boxes for the 2017 students in
Toyon, Wilbur, Branner, Florence
Moore, Lagunita and Roble, where,
because of an arrangement between
the University and the Director of
Collection and Delivery Services in San
Francisco, there is no mail delivery.
Students Scheme
Most of these students have
arranged to have their mail sent to the
box of a roommate or friend, and
because the Post Office delivers only

to the name on the lease, they have
schemed with parents and friends to
address envelopes to the person legally
renting the box, but with a special sign
that earmarks their letters.
According to Walter Findeisen,
University recorder, the absence of a
legitimate mailing address for all
students is a big problem for the
registrar's office, whose sole means of
communication is through the mail. It
has no way of sending study lists and
counseling information to the student.
In addition, official government

communications, such as sample
ballots and letters from legislators, do
not reach the student.
Ellen Lautz, former director of
Roble Hall, who investigated postal
operations on campus last year, said
the current system of selective delivery
has evolved more by custom than for
logical reasons.
Mail is delivered to Stern, Crothers,
and Crothers Memorial because they
have locked boxes in the building.
These dorms were built in 1949 when
the Post Office faced a similar box

shortage, so the Post Office paid for
their installation. When Mirrielees was
built in 1970, boxes were installed
anticipating another shortage at the
main postal facility.
No Agreement
In these four cases, the University
arranged for delivery with the
Sectional Post Office in San Francisco
at the time they were built. Because
no boxes were installed in the six
other dorms, no agreement for
delivery was negotiated with the
Sectional Collection and Delivery
facility.
Mail delivered to the University
with insufficient address is routed to
Armista Cook in the registrar's office,
who uses an up-to-date student
directory to readdress all first-class
mail. When no mailing address is
available, letters are returned to the
sender. Mail is not sent to dorms that
do not receive mail from the Post
Office.
In May 1972, 400 to 500 sample
ballots addressed to Stanford students
at their University residences, not
mailing addresses, were destroyed by
Post Office employees. The ballots
were sent third-class, so they were
"properly handled in that respect,"
according to Palo Alto Postmaster
James Hodgen. He added, however,
that "this was poor judgment on our
part even though we may have been
technically right."
At that time George Mann, registrar
of voters for Santa Clara County, said,
"Stanford is a real problem as far as
mail is concerned." Students had

shortage which, apparently, is destined to continue for several years.
registered at a residence address for
precinct placement purposes, but
because of the ballot destruction,
Mann's office has changed its mailing
procedures for Stanford to include
box numbers and not residences.
Problem Unsolved
However, the problem for students
with no mailing address remains
unsolved. The University has received
many letters from parents who have
no way of corresponding with their
sons and daughters. When they write
in care of the dorm, their letters are
returned or lost. As one father said,
"There is something missing in the
mail handling on campus."
The most obvious solution would
seem to be direct delivery to all
dormitories, but there are legal and
financial obstacles. Several dorm
directors have recommended box
installation in the individual houses,
and Associate Dean of Students Larry
Horton has suggested the crunch could
be relieved if boxes were put into only
one of the six complexes. In view of
the high cost of boxes — estimated at
$10 per student — he believes this is a

more realistic proposal.
Legally however, delivery to each
dorm is not possible. According to
G.A. Alasia, manager of the San
Francisco METRO Center, the Post
Office adopted a policy in March,
1972 that mail will not be delivered to
University mail boxes in college dorms
because it interferes with the Postal
Service responsibilities "to maintain an
efficient system of collecting, sorting
and delivery of the mail nationwide."
Alasia said it would be impossible
to keep a current directory of every
student residing in dormitories, so the
most efficient mail service is through
boxes in the Stanford Post Office
branch.
Mail will continue to be delivered
to all other University housing,
however, because of arrangements
made before the 1972 ruling.
Expensive Idea r
One student's suggestion is to have
the mail delivered in bulk "just like
they do in a big hotel" to the dorm
offices. This would require hiring
someone to daily sort and deliver mail.
According to Alan Cummings,
manager of residences and fraternities,

the housing office doesn't have the
money to staff that position.
Most dorm directors believe the
possibility of theft and loss make it
inadvisable to have mail delivered bulk
and just left on a general table for
students to pick up themselves. Ellen
Lautz, who surveyed dorm
administration staffs, said, "Overall,
this was felt to be an untenable
solution."
Lautz believes the most reasonable
solution would be to expand the White
Plaza Post Office to provide space for
additional boxes. There is no room for
more boxes outside the building, but
Page Pointer, supervisor of the
Stanford Post Office, submitted a
proposal in January, 1973 to extend
the front of the building 15 feet.
Pointer saicl this would make room for
approximately 900 more boxes.
Long Wait
The proposal has been accepted by
Postmaster Hodjgen and is in San
Francisco awaiting approval. But,
Pointer said, it may be several years
before a decision is made because the
Postal Service is currently building
large bulk man centers tnat are

receiving top priority
Although requests for expansion
are generally accepted by the Post
Office engineering department,
approval by the San Francisco office
does not give Pointer the green light to
build. Because the University owns the
land and building occupied by the Post
Office, modification and expansion
must be approved by Dan DeYoung,
director of Plant Services.
But DeYoung said he is optimistic
about approval of the expansion plans.
"It's just a matter of time," he added.
The project has been handed over
to Michael Korff, a graduate student
who works in the Dean of Student
Affairs office, but little or no action is
being taken because it is "not a
priority project," according to Horton.
Lautz calls the project "an
orphan," — no one wants to tackle it
because it's such a "circular issue."

Affairs office, but little or no action is
being taken because it is "not a
priority project," according to Horton.
Lautz calls the project "an

About the only thing slower than
the U.S. mail these days is the action
being taken to alleviate the shortage of
post office boxes at Stanford.
Several hundred students are denied
mail service each year because of
inadequate facilities at the Stanford
Post Office and slow action by the
University and the U.S. Postal Service.
About 500 students living in
residences where no mail is delivered
were unable to rent boxes at the
Stanford branch early this quarter
because the 5300 boxes were already
taken.
Information published by the
registrar's office in October showed
that approximately 1350 boxes were
rented by non-students. The majority
of these were rented by faculty
members who can receive mail at their
homes.
Post
Office regulations state a box must be
rented to any individual who requests
one.
About 2300 boxes were rented to
students living in residences that
receive postal service, leaving only
1500 boxes for the 2017 students in
Toyon, Wilbur, Branner, Florence
Moore, Lagunita and Roble, where,
because of an arrangement between
the University and the Director of
Collection and Delivery Services in San
Francisco, there is no mail delivery.
Students Scheme
Most of these students have
arranged to have their mail sent to the
box of a roommate or friend, and
because the Post Office delivers only

to the name on the lease, they have
schemed with parents and friends to
address envelopes to the person legally
renting the box, but with a special sign
that earmarks their letters.
According to Walter Findeisen,
University recorder, the absence of a
legitimate mailing address for all
students is a big problem for the
registrar's office, whose sole means of
communication is through the mail. It
has no way of sending study lists and
counseling information to the student.
In addition, official government

communications, such as sample
ballots and letters from legislators, do
not reach the student.
Ellen Lautz, former director of
Roble Hall, who investigated postal
operations on campus last year, said
the current system of selective delivery
has evolved more by custom than for
logical reasons.
Mail is delivered to Stern, Crothers,
and Crothers Memorial because they
have locked boxes in the building.
These dorms were built in 1949 when
the Post Office faced a similar box

shortage, so the Post Office paid for
their installation. When Mirrielees was
built in 1970, boxes were installed
anticipating another shortage at the
main postal facility.
No Agreement
In these four cases, the University
arranged for delivery with the
Sectional Post Office in San Francisco
at the time they were built. Because
no boxes were installed in the six
other dorms, no agreement for
delivery was negotiated with the
Sectional Collection and Delivery
facility.
Mail delivered to the University
with insufficient address is routed to
Armista Cook in the registrar's office,
who uses an up-to-date student
directory to readdress all first-class
mail. When no mailing address is
available, letters are returned to the
sender. Mail is not sent to dorms that
do not receive mail from the Post
Office.
In May 1972, 400 to 500 sample
ballots addressed to Stanford students
at their University residences, not
mailing addresses, were destroyed by
Post Office employees. The ballots
were sent third-class, so they were
"properly handled in that respect,"
according to Palo Alto Postmaster
James Hodgen. He added, however,
that "this was poor judgment on our
part even though we may have been
technically right."
At that time George Mann, registrar
of voters for Santa Clara County, said,
"Stanford is a real problem as far as
mail is concerned." Students had

shortage which, apparently, is destined to continue for several years.
registered at a residence address for
precinct placement purposes, but
because of the ballot destruction,
Mann's office has changed its mailing
procedures for Stanford to include
box numbers and not residences.
Problem Unsolved
However, the problem for students
with no mailing address remains
unsolved. The University has received
many letters from parents who have
no way of corresponding with their
sons and daughters. When they write
in care of the dorm, their letters are
returned or lost. As one father said,
"There is something missing in the
mail handling on campus."
The most obvious solution would
seem to be direct delivery to all
dormitories, but there are legal and
financial obstacles. Several dorm
directors have recommended box
installation in the individual houses,
and Associate Dean of Students Larry
Horton has suggested the crunch could
be relieved if boxes were put into only
one of the six complexes. In view of
the high cost of boxes — estimated at
$10 per student — he believes this is a

more realistic proposal.
Legally however, delivery to each
dorm is not possible. According to
G.A. Alasia, manager of the San
Francisco METRO Center, the Post
Office adopted a policy in March,
1972 that mail will not be delivered to
University mail boxes in college dorms
because it interferes with the Postal
Service responsibilities "to maintain an
efficient system of collecting, sorting
and delivery of the mail nationwide."
Alasia said it would be impossible
to keep a current directory of every
student residing in dormitories, so the
most efficient mail service is through
boxes in the Stanford Post Office
branch.
Mail will continue to be delivered
to all other University housing,
however, because of arrangements
made before the 1972 ruling.
Expensive Idea r
One student's suggestion is to have
the mail delivered in bulk "just like
they do in a big hotel" to the dorm
offices. This would require hiring
someone to daily sort and deliver mail.
According to Alan Cummings,
manager of residences and fraternities,

the housing office doesn't have the
money to staff that position.
Most dorm directors believe the
possibility of theft and loss make it
inadvisable to have mail delivered bulk
and just left on a general table for
students to pick up themselves. Ellen
Lautz, who surveyed dorm
administration staffs, said, "Overall,
this was felt to be an untenable
solution."
Lautz believes the most reasonable
solution would be to expand the White
Plaza Post Office to provide space for
additional boxes. There is no room for
more boxes outside the building, but
Page Pointer, supervisor of the
Stanford Post Office, submitted a
proposal in January, 1973 to extend
the front of the building 15 feet.
Pointer saicl this would make room for
approximately 900 more boxes.
Long Wait
The proposal has been accepted by
Postmaster Hodjgen and is in San
Francisco awaiting approval. But,
Pointer said, it may be several years
before a decision is made because the
Postal Service is currently building
large bulk man centers tnat are

receiving top priority
Although requests for expansion
are generally accepted by the Post
Office engineering department,
approval by the San Francisco office
does not give Pointer the green light to
build. Because the University owns the
land and building occupied by the Post
Office, modification and expansion
must be approved by Dan DeYoung,
director of Plant Services.
But DeYoung said he is optimistic
about approval of the expansion plans.
"It's just a matter of time," he added.
The project has been handed over
to Michael Korff, a graduate student
who works in the Dean of Student
Affairs office, but little or no action is
being taken because it is "not a
priority project," according to Horton.

"It's just a matter of time," he added.
The project has been handed over
to Michael Korff, a graduate student
who works in the Dean of Student
Affairs office, but little or no action is
being taken because it is "not a
priority project," according to Horton.
Lautz calls the project "an
orphan," — no one wants to tackle it
because it's such a "circular issue."

About the only thing slower than
the U.S. mail these days is the action
being taken to alleviate the shortage of
post office boxes at Stanford.
Several hundred students are denied
mail service each year because of
inadequate facilities at the Stanford
Post Office and slow action by the
University and the U.S. Postal Service.
About 500 students living in
residences where no mail is delivered
were unable to rent boxes at the
Stanford branch early this quarter
because the 5300 boxes were already
taken.
Information published by the
registrar's office in October showed
that approximately 1350 boxes were
rented by non-students. The majority
of these were rented by faculty
members who can receive mail at their
homes.
Post
Office regulations state a box must be
rented to any individual who requests
one.
About 2300 boxes were rented to
students living in residences that
receive postal service, leaving only
1500 boxes for the 2017 students in
Toyon, Wilbur, Branner, Florence
Moore, Lagunita and Roble, where,
because of an arrangement between
the University and the Director of
Collection and Delivery Services in San
Francisco, there is no mail delivery.
Students Scheme
Most of these students have
arranged to have their mail sent to the
box of a roommate or friend, and
because the Post Office delivers only

to the name on the lease, they have
schemed with parents and friends to
address envelopes to the person legally
renting the box, but with a special sign
that earmarks their letters.
According to Walter Findeisen,
University recorder, the absence of a
legitimate mailing address for all
students is a big problem for the
registrar's office, whose sole means of
communication is through the mail. It
has no way of sending study lists and
counseling information to the student.
In addition, official government

communications, such as sample
ballots and letters from legislators, do
not reach the student.
Ellen Lautz, former director of
Roble Hall, who investigated postal
operations on campus last year, said
the current system of selective delivery
has evolved more by custom than for
logical reasons.
Mail is delivered to Stern, Crothers,
and Crothers Memorial because they
have locked boxes in the building.
These dorms were built in 1949 when
the Post Office faced a similar box

shortage, so the Post Office paid for
their installation. When Mirrielees was
built in 1970, boxes were installed
anticipating another shortage at the
main postal facility.
No Agreement
In these four cases, the University
arranged for delivery with the
Sectional Post Office in San Francisco
at the time they were built. Because
no boxes were installed in the six
other dorms, no agreement for
delivery was negotiated with the
Sectional Collection and Delivery
facility.
Mail delivered to the University
with insufficient address is routed to
Armista Cook in the registrar's office,
who uses an up-to-date student
directory to readdress all first-class
mail. When no mailing address is
available, letters are returned to the
sender. Mail is not sent to dorms that
do not receive mail from the Post
Office.
In May 1972, 400 to 500 sample
ballots addressed to Stanford students
at their University residences, not
mailing addresses, were destroyed by
Post Office employees. The ballots
were sent third-class, so they were
"properly handled in that respect,"
according to Palo Alto Postmaster
James Hodgen. He added, however,
that "this was poor judgment on our
part even though we may have been
technically right."
At that time George Mann, registrar
of voters for Santa Clara County, said,
"Stanford is a real problem as far as
mail is concerned." Students had

shortage which, apparently, is destined to continue for several years.
registered at a residence address for
precinct placement purposes, but
because of the ballot destruction,
Mann's office has changed its mailing
procedures for Stanford to include
box numbers and not residences.
Problem Unsolved
However, the problem for students
with no mailing address remains
unsolved. The University has received
many letters from parents who have
no way of corresponding with their
sons and daughters. When they write
in care of the dorm, their letters are
returned or lost. As one father said,
"There is something missing in the
mail handling on campus."
The most obvious solution would
seem to be direct delivery to all
dormitories, but there are legal and
financial obstacles. Several dorm
directors have recommended box
installation in the individual houses,
and Associate Dean of Students Larry
Horton has suggested the crunch could
be relieved if boxes were put into only
one of the six complexes. In view of
the high cost of boxes — estimated at
$10 per student — he believes this is a

more realistic proposal.
Legally however, delivery to each
dorm is not possible. According to
G.A. Alasia, manager of the San
Francisco METRO Center, the Post
Office adopted a policy in March,
1972 that mail will not be delivered to
University mail boxes in college dorms
because it interferes with the Postal
Service responsibilities "to maintain an
efficient system of collecting, sorting
and delivery of the mail nationwide."
Alasia said it would be impossible
to keep a current directory of every
student residing in dormitories, so the
most efficient mail service is through
boxes in the Stanford Post Office
branch.
Mail will continue to be delivered
to all other University housing,
however, because of arrangements
made before the 1972 ruling.
Expensive Idea r
One student's suggestion is to have
the mail delivered in bulk "just like
they do in a big hotel" to the dorm
offices. This would require hiring
someone to daily sort and deliver mail.
According to Alan Cummings,
manager of residences and fraternities,

the housing office doesn't have the
money to staff that position.
Most dorm directors believe the
possibility of theft and loss make it
inadvisable to have mail delivered bulk
and just left on a general table for
students to pick up themselves. Ellen
Lautz, who surveyed dorm
administration staffs, said, "Overall,
this was felt to be an untenable
solution."
Lautz believes the most reasonable
solution would be to expand the White
Plaza Post Office to provide space for
additional boxes. There is no room for
more boxes outside the building, but
Page Pointer, supervisor of the
Stanford Post Office, submitted a
proposal in January, 1973 to extend
the front of the building 15 feet.
Pointer saicl this would make room for
approximately 900 more boxes.
Long Wait
The proposal has been accepted by
Postmaster Hodjgen and is in San
Francisco awaiting approval. But,
Pointer said, it may be several years
before a decision is made because the
Postal Service is currently building
large bulk man centers tnat are

receiving top priority
Although requests for expansion
are generally accepted by the Post
Office engineering department,
approval by the San Francisco office
does not give Pointer the green light to
build. Because the University owns the
land and building occupied by the Post
Office, modification and expansion
must be approved by Dan DeYoung,
director of Plant Services.
But DeYoung said he is optimistic
about approval of the expansion plans.
"It's just a matter of time," he added.
