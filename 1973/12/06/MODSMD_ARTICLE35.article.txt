# Action To Relieve Shortage Slow
## 500 Students Lack P.O. Boxes 
### KATHY CUNNINGHAM 
About the only thing slower than
the U.S. mail these days is the action
being taken to alleviate the shortage of
post office boxes at Stanford.
Several hundred students are denied
mail service each year because of
inadequate facilities at the Stanford
Post Office and slow action by the
University and the U.S. Postal Service.
About 500 students living in
residences where no mail is delivered
were unable to rent boxes at the
Stanford branch early this quarter
because the 5300 boxes were already
taken.
Information published by the
registrar's office in October showed
that approximately 1350 boxes were
rented by non-students. The majority
of these were rented by faculty
members who can receive mail at their
homes.
Post
Office regulations state a box must be
rented to any individual who requests
one.
About 2300 boxes were rented to
students living in residences that
receive postal service, leaving only
1500 boxes for the 2017 students in
Toyon, Wilbur, Branner, Florence
Moore, Lagunita and Roble, where,
because of an arrangement between
the University and the Director of
Collection and Delivery Services in San
Francisco, there is no mail delivery.
Students Scheme
Most of these students have
arranged to have their mail sent to the
box of a roommate or friend, and
because the Post Office delivers only

to the name on the lease, they have
schemed with parents and friends to
address envelopes to the person legally
renting the box, but with a special sign
that earmarks their letters.
According to Walter Findeisen,
University recorder, the absence of a
legitimate mailing address for all
students is a big problem for the
registrar's office, whose sole means of
communication is through the mail. It
has no way of sending study lists and
counseling information to the student.
In addition, official government

communications, such as sample
ballots and letters from legislators, do
not reach the student.
Ellen Lautz, former director of
Roble Hall, who investigated postal
operations on campus last year, said
the current system of selective delivery
has evolved more by custom than for
logical reasons.
Mail is delivered to Stern, Crothers,
and Crothers Memorial because they
have locked boxes in the building.
These dorms were built in 1949 when
the Post Office faced a similar box

shortage, so the Post Office paid for
their installation. When Mirrielees was
built in 1970, boxes were installed
anticipating another shortage at the
main postal facility.
No Agreement
In these four cases, the University
arranged for delivery with the
Sectional Post Office in San Francisco
at the time they were built. Because
no boxes were installed in the six
other dorms, no agreement for
delivery was negotiated with the
Sectional Collection and Delivery
facility.
Mail delivered to the University
with insufficient address is routed to
Armista Cook in the registrar's office,
who uses an up-to-date student
directory to readdress all first-class
mail. When no mailing address is
available, letters are returned to the
sender. Mail is not sent to dorms that
do not receive mail from the Post
Office.
In May 1972, 400 to 500 sample
ballots addressed to Stanford students
at their University residences, not
mailing addresses, were destroyed by
Post Office employees. The ballots
were sent third-class, so they were
"properly handled in that respect,"
according to Palo Alto Postmaster
James Hodgen. He added, however,
that "this was poor judgment on our
part even though we may have been
technically right."
At that time George Mann, registrar
of voters for Santa Clara County, said,
"Stanford is a real problem as far as
mail is concerned." Students had

HE'S LUCKY—About 500 students currently lack post office boxes due to a
shortage which, apparently, is destined to continue for several years.
