# It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like An Energy Crisis

### SANDY WHITE 
The charge, "Commercialism!" is a common one
at Christmas time. The lights and decorations which
appear after Halloween, the overcrowded stores
with their elaborate displays, and the ever-present
figure of Santa Claus — all have been attacked as
symptoms of a cold, money-grubbing society. But
this year, for whatever reason, Americans will
experience a less flamboyant holiday season.
The result of President Nixon's action to ease the
energy crisis by including a ban on outdoor
Christmas lights is already apparent in Stanford area
stores. Both Town and Country Village and the
Stanford Shopping Center, as well as other local
stores, have taken down their lights.
The theme of all this plug-pulling is togetherness.
Although the Christmas lights of one store do not
use much energy, a collective effort can make a
difference, says Joe Schramm of the Stanford
Shopping Center. Palo Alto officials are encouraging
city-wide cooperation with the ban.
But the public has proved a harsher judge. For
example, Macy's department store in the Stanford
Shopping Center hung tiny lights on trees
throughout the store, but public vigilance forced
them to be turned off. Lights inside the walkways at
Town and Country were also removed.
Power Cut
Macy's has no exterior Christmas lights, and is
cutting its power consumption by 10 percent. While
Christmas lights are "a highly visible use of power
that could upset some of our customers," explains
manager D.H. McCullough, turning them off
actually creates only minor savings in electricity.
Real economizing comes from running the
escalators for shorter periods, and cutting back on
unnecessary overhead lights.
One Town and Country store employee called
the new look "dull, uninviting and dreary, especially

at night." In compensation, he is decorating his
hardware store with more color this year.
In a move that would make Euell Gibbons proud,
the Stanford Shopping Center purchased 44 live
trees, which line the walkways in front of the
stores. After the holiday season they will go to local
high schools and elementary schools for planting.
The Macy's bulletin reminds employees that "we
want to preserve the feeling of Christmas in our
stores. Christmas business is important .... to each
of us in terms of jobs." Or, as one clerk explained,
"we're supposed to try to show the spirit more from
within."
Lights Gone
Although decorations have not been limited yet
to simply glasswax on the windows and
cranberry-popcorn chains, gone are the
many-colored lights from the storefronts and trees.
You can still find tinsel garlands, grinning Santas,
and revolving artificial trees. But to many people, it
"just doesn't feel like Christmas" without outdoor
lights.
Although the lights are out, tradition still
prevails. Almost every store in both centers has a
tree in the window, shiny ribbons on the ceiling, or
painted holly on the window panes. Santa still sits
in the Macy's toy department, and the Salvation
Army bell-ringer still stands in front of
Woolworth's.
"We miss Christmas lights like we miss other
things" that consume energy, says Schramm. But
everyone cooperates, perhaps out of patriotic
fervor, more likely from necessity. Some see this
"back-to-nature" Christmas as a challenge or
adventure, others as an inconvenience.
As you refrain from stringing up your lights this
Christmas, it may be comforting to see big
businesses do the same.

LIGHTS OUT — This mournful shopper may be unhappy because so many
department stores in the Stanford area have complied with President Nixon s
request to conserve energy by banning holiday lights from their storefronts.
