# Augsburger Debates County Plan, Advocates University Exemption
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The University will continue to
seek exclusion from Santa Clara
County's proposed city services (cs)
ordinance, Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance,
declared on KZSU's weekly campus
conference program Tuesday.
The "cs" zone would require
certain areas bordering municipalities
to seek annexation to those cities prior
to developing new building projects.
Palo Alto recently passed a
resolution in opposition to the
University's proposal that academic
lands be excluded from the ordinance.
Instead, the City Council has made a
proposal that would bring 270 acres of
undeveloped academic land, primarily
those fronting on El Camino Real and
Willow Road, under the control of
Palo Alto.
Augsburger said that while he
supports the basic intent of the "cs"
ordinance — to protect the
environment from arbitrary urban
expansion — the University should be
excluded from the ordinance because
it provides its own municipal services
and plans its development in an
exemplary manner.
Although Stanford must be subject
to some government controls, those
controls must come from the county
rather than from the city of Palo Alto,
he explained.
Broad Responsibility
"The county can take a broader
and less parochial view," Augsburger
stated. "Stanford's responsibilities
extend beyond Palo Alto. They are
national — indeed international."
Stanford is willing to cooperate
with the city of Palo Alto on the
matter, Augsburger said. But the
University became very discouraged

when the City Council recently
rejected an alternative measure
proposed by Stanford.
The Stanford proposal provided for
the University to give Palo Alto notice
on all new construction plans together
with an environmental impact report
prior to spending any money on new
projects.
The "cs" zone proposal would in
effect grant Palo Alto veto power over

new Stanford developments and this
would endanger the University's
academic freedom, Augsburger
affirmed.
The "cs" zone has not yet been
discussed by the newly formed
Stanford/Palo Alto liaison committee,
Augsburger said. However, it should be
placed on the table for consideration
in order to strive for the amelioration
of thhe problem, which is straining

relations between the University and
the city, he said.
Privacy Defended
On another subject, Augsburger
defended the privacy of the liaison
committee's meetings. He emphasized
that minutes of the meetings are
widely distributed and said that the
privacy of the meetings facilitate
openness in the discussions.
Subjecting the meetings to the
public would inhibit the relation that
Stanford is attempting to establish
with Palo Alto, Augsburger remarked,
noting that both he and Palo Alto City
Manager Oeorge Sipel are agreed upon
this point. Furthermore, the liaison
committee is an administrative rather
than a governing body, he added.
When asked if the recession
anticipated by some economists would
adversely affect the University,
Augsburger noted that if stocks
decline in value, the University can not
help but to be hurt. But there is some
reason for optimism, he noted.
Stanford has recenlty reconstructed its
investment portfolio, enlarged the
scope of its investments and focused
investment on those companies that
experts expect to prosper during the
next few years.

WORLDWIDE VlEW—Robert Augsburger, University vice president for business
and finance, urged that Stanford be exempted from Santa Clara County's 'cs'
ordinance as the University has an "international responsibility," and must not
be hampered in development of its lands.
