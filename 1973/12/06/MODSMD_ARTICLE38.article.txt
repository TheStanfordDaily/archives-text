# Future Role Of SCIRE Discussed
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
The appointment of a new director
for the Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education (SCIRE)
will probably not occur until the
spring, pending a thorough review of
the program and its objectives.
This statement came out of a
"brainstorming" session held last week
by a group of SCIRE Policy Board
members and others concerned over
the fate of SCIRE.
Dan Lewis, the director of the
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), raised the
question of whether SCIRE should
continue to exist as a separate entity.
Much of the earlier impetus for
educational reform has faded from
SCIRE, he said. "Eighty or 90 percent
of the projects the Board reviews for
accreditation are pretty ordinary," he
added.
Lewis suggested that a tension
exists between the two primary
functions of SCIRE. Accreditation of
projects ought to be left up to the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Office,
freeing SCIRE "to facilitate
innovation and research in
Education," he suggested.
'Real Contribution'
"The real contribution of SCIRE is
in helping students direct their
educations," emphasized Lewis.
Specifically, he offered a four point
program for SCIRE to secure this
result. The plan includes provisions for
work-study opportunities, special
projects accredited through SCIRE, an
Undergraduate Research Opportunities
program and increased work with
departmental programs.
"What we need is to get things
going again and to generate excitement
in SCIRE too. To do so, we need to
use an ad hoc approach rather than a
formalized approach to our
problems," he concluded.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy explained that SCIRE was
an outgrowth of the student power
movement of the 19605. "Recently,"
he said, "SCIRE has spent most of its
time battling the Dean." Such fighting,
he speculated, may come from the fact
that SCIRE predated the creation of
the Dean's office. Over time, the
Dean's power over SCIRE and
SWOPSI grew until some
confronta»'r>n was unavoidable. That is
the situation i he contended.
Studeni ».. F ut Needed
Abernethy reiterated Lewis'
proposal for work-study and added
that "departments need to be dealt
with directly." He also pointed out the
need for student input into teaching in
all departments.
"There are all kinds of resources in
the community or in the Bay Area
that can be tapped," he declared.
"What SCIRE ought to do is promote
the flow of information and criticism
from these people and make students
aware that such opportunities for
criticism and assistance exist."
Former ASSU Vice President Brent
Appel, emphasized the need for
SCIRE to remain controversial. Above
all, he noted, SCIRE must maintain its
ability to challenge people.
Bureaucracy Possible
"I'm afraid of [Lewis'] facilitation
because it may take the stress off of
challenging education. We have to
watch out to avoid the bureaucratic
possibilities for SCIRE," he said.
The discussion centered on the
problem of the bureaucratization of
SCIRE. Many of those present felt
that an ad hoc approach to
organization might be more
appropriate to the purposes of SCIRE.
However, the problem then arose of
how to maintain "credence and clout"
with the University if SCIRE were to
operate on such a basis.

Abernethy reiterated Lewis'
proposal for work-study and added
that "departments need to be dealt
with directly." He also pointed out the
need for student input into teaching in
all departments.
"There are all kinds of resources in
the community or in the Bay Area
that can be tapped," he declared.
"What SCIRE ought to do is promote
the flow of information and criticism
from these people and make students
aware that such opportunities for
criticism and assistance exist."
Former ASSU Vice President Brent
Appel, emphasized the need for
SCIRE to remain controversial. Above
all, he noted, SCIRE must maintain its
ability to challenge people.
Bureaucracy Possible
"I'm afraid of [Lewis'] facilitation
because it may take the stress off of
challenging education. We have to
watch out to avoid the bureaucratic
possibilities for SCIRE," he said.
The discussion centered on the
problem of the bureaucratization of
SCIRE. Many of those present felt
that an ad hoc approach to
organization might be more
appropriate to the purposes of SCIRE.
However, the problem then arose of
how to maintain "credence and clout"
with the University if SCIRE were to
operate on such a basis.
The appointment of a new director
for the Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education (SCIRE)
will probably not occur until the
spring, pending a thorough review of
the program and its objectives.
This statement came out of a
"brainstorming" session held last week
by a group of SCIRE Policy Board
members and others concerned over
the fate of SCIRE.
Dan Lewis, the director of the
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), raised the
question of whether SCIRE should
continue to exist as a separate entity.
Much of the earlier impetus for
educational reform has faded from
SCIRE, he said. "Eighty or 90 percent
of the projects the Board reviews for
accreditation are pretty ordinary," he
added.
Lewis suggested that a tension
exists between the two primary
functions of SCIRE. Accreditation of
projects ought to be left up to the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Office,
freeing SCIRE "to facilitate
innovation and research in
Education," he suggested.
'Real Contribution'
"The real contribution of SCIRE is
in helping students direct their
educations," emphasized Lewis.
Specifically, he offered a four point
program for SCIRE to secure this
result. The plan includes provisions for
work-study opportunities, special
projects accredited through SCIRE, an
Undergraduate Research Opportunities
program and increased work with
departmental programs.
"What we need is to get things
going again and to generate excitement
in SCIRE too. To do so, we need to
use an ad hoc approach rather than a
formalized approach to our
problems," he concluded.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy explained that SCIRE was
an outgrowth of the student power
movement of the 19605. "Recently,"
he said, "SCIRE has spent most of its
time battling the Dean." Such fighting,
he speculated, may come from the fact
that SCIRE predated the creation of
the Dean's office. Over time, the
Dean's power over SCIRE and
SWOPSI grew until some
confronta»'r>n was unavoidable. That is
