# The 						San Jose Symphony
## Cultured Artistry Despite Flaws 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Maestro George Cleve led the
San Jose Symphony Orchestra
through a program of concert-hall
chestnuts last Friday evening at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
And in spite of a few errors, a
disappointing solist, and rather
dreadful surroundings, Cleve and
the orchestra delivered
performances worth hearing
San Jose, of course, isn't the
most likely place to find a good
symphony orchestra, or culture in
any form, for that matter. Cleve
and his instrumentalists must
battle horrible acoustics in an
auditorium resembling a
high-school gym decorated with
potted plants, audience members
who wander up and down aisles
through entire movements, and
constant interruptions from
low-flying jet aircraft as well as
the usual dilemmas facing any

musical organization.
Even with these handicaps the
San Jose Symphony sounds pretty
good — amazingly good, in fact.
Lacking that precision in phrasing
and intonation characteristic of
really great ensembles, the
orchestra nonetheless brings
enthusiasm and moments of real
artistry to their performances.
A satisfactory if somewhat
rigid performance of
Mendelssohn's turbulent Hebrides
Overture opened the program.
Fine string playing and a
particularly lovely clarinet solo in
the recapitulation almost brought
tears to one's eyes. Cleve chose to
sacrifice sentimentality for a
strong, no-nonsense
interpretation, but the conclusion
of the work was simply too tight
and blunt for my taste.
Flawed Piano Concerto
Peter Serkin joined the

orchestra for a seriously flawed
presentation of Mozart's last and
most sublime piano concerto, K.
595. San Francisco critics last
year hailed the 26-year-old son of
master artist Rudolf Serkin for
"some of the most refined,
flawless playing of the century."
Reviews like that baffle me;
there must be hundreds of pianists
today better than Peter Serkin,
some of them still in school. His
Mozart was occasionally warm
and sweet, but more frequently
harsh and uneven. Many lovely
phrases were over-interpreted,
filled with wrong notes or erratic
and anachronistic ornamentation.
First and last movement cadenzas
were rushed, and delicacy
disappeared under thick and
uncharacteristic pedalling.
The San Jose Symphony,
fortunately, saved the day. Cleve's
knowledgable musicianship

inspired enjoyable and tasteful
playing by his orchestra. A few
fine moments (such as the flute
and piano doubling in the second
movement) were lost, but some
shone through, including an
elegant first-movement bassoon
solo.
Unsettling Pathetique
Tchaikovsky's famous (and
übiquitous) Symphnic Pathetique
brought the evening to an
unsettling conclusion. The
orchestra and Maestro Cleve did a
completely credible musical job,
bringing life to this marvellous if
too-frequently-heard work.
The first movement rambled a
bit, though individual players and
sections produced satisfactory
sound and some fine effects. The
second movement (a kind of 5/4
Waltz) and the following March
were even better; Tchaikovsky's
fantastic sense for instrumental

color and climax came across in
an exciting performance that
received hearty applause.
But the concluding "Adagio
lamentoso" was marred by
audience fidgeting, and by loud
snoring from the right balcony
which may have prompted certain
embarrassed listeners to begin
clapping a full phrase before the
end of the movement. The
orchestra was forced to leave
Tschaikovsky's masterpiece
unfinished; their tolerance in the
face of such rudeness was
commendable, but scarcely what
such boorish behavior deserved.
With a new hall, a more
considerate clientele, and a few
more years to grow, the San Jose
Symphony can look forward to
ranking among the nation's best
orchestras.

Maestro George Cleve led the
San Jose Symphony Orchestra
through a program of concert-hall
chestnuts last Friday evening at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
And in spite of a few errors, a
disappointing solist, and rather
dreadful surroundings, Cleve and
the orchestra delivered
performances worth hearing
San Jose, of course, isn't the
most likely place to find a good
symphony orchestra, or culture in
any form, for that matter. Cleve
and his instrumentalists must
battle horrible acoustics in an
auditorium resembling a
high-school gym decorated with
potted plants, audience members
who wander up and down aisles
through entire movements, and
constant interruptions from
low-flying jet aircraft as well as
the usual dilemmas facing any

musical organization.
Even with these handicaps the
San Jose Symphony sounds pretty
good — amazingly good, in fact.
Lacking that precision in phrasing
and intonation characteristic of
really great ensembles, the
orchestra nonetheless brings
enthusiasm and moments of real
artistry to their performances.
A satisfactory if somewhat
rigid performance of
Mendelssohn's turbulent Hebrides
Overture opened the program.
Fine string playing and a
particularly lovely clarinet solo in
the recapitulation almost brought
tears to one's eyes. Cleve chose to
sacrifice sentimentality for a
strong, no-nonsense
interpretation, but the conclusion
of the work was simply too tight
and blunt for my taste.
Flawed Piano Concerto
Peter Serkin joined the

orchestra for a seriously flawed
presentation of Mozart's last and
most sublime piano concerto, K.
595. San Francisco critics last
year hailed the 26-year-old son of
master artist Rudolf Serkin for
"some of the most refined,
flawless playing of the century."
Reviews like that baffle me;
there must be hundreds of pianists
today better than Peter Serkin,
some of them still in school. His
Mozart was occasionally warm
and sweet, but more frequently
harsh and uneven. Many lovely
phrases were over-interpreted,
filled with wrong notes or erratic
and anachronistic ornamentation.
First and last movement cadenzas
were rushed, and delicacy
disappeared under thick and
uncharacteristic pedalling.
The San Jose Symphony,
fortunately, saved the day. Cleve's
knowledgable musicianship

inspired enjoyable and tasteful
playing by his orchestra. A few
fine moments (such as the flute
and piano doubling in the second
movement) were lost, but some
shone through, including an
elegant first-movement bassoon
solo.
Unsettling Pathetique
Tchaikovsky's famous (and
übiquitous) Symphnic Pathetique
brought the evening to an
unsettling conclusion. The
orchestra and Maestro Cleve did a
completely credible musical job,
bringing life to this marvellous if
too-frequently-heard work.
The first movement rambled a
bit, though individual players and
sections produced satisfactory
sound and some fine effects. The
second movement (a kind of 5/4
Waltz) and the following March
were even better; Tchaikovsky's
fantastic sense for instrumental

color and climax came across in
an exciting performance that
received hearty applause.
But the concluding "Adagio
lamentoso" was marred by
audience fidgeting, and by loud
snoring from the right balcony
which may have prompted certain
embarrassed listeners to begin
clapping a full phrase before the
end of the movement. The
orchestra was forced to leave
Tschaikovsky's masterpiece
unfinished; their tolerance in the
face of such rudeness was
commendable, but scarcely what
such boorish behavior deserved.
With a new hall, a more
considerate clientele, and a few
more years to grow, the San Jose
Symphony can look forward to
ranking among the nation's best
orchestras.
