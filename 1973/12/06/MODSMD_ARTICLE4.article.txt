# Student Tuition Deferment Plan Possibly Violates Two Statutes

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The University's system for student
fee deferments, used by at least 2000
p( pie per quarter, may be on shaky
legaf ground, legal sources have told
the Daily.
Some aspects of the system may
violate the Federal Truth in Lending
Act, and may also violate the state
Unruh Act on consumer credit if the
latter statute is applicable.
A Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
official said after examining the
deferment forms that they violated the
Truth in Lending Act by not listing an
annual percentage rate for the finance
charge.
The University has contended that
the disclosure statement on the
deferment forms satisfies a provision
in the regulation for "deferments and
extensions." The forms list the
schedule of payments and the dollar
amounts used in figuring the finance
charge, but do not list an annual
percentage rate.
Former University attorney C.
Ward Cullen, answering complaints
about the system two years ago, cited

section 226.8 (1) of the Truth in
Lending Act, which provides that no
annual percentage rate is necessary on
"deferments or extensions" of
payments. (Percentage rates are
required on virtually all credit
transactions.)
However, the FTC official told the
Daily that the section was not
intended to cover the original terms of
an agreement. "It was meant to
concern the man who, say, is going to
miss the due date of a payment and
just wants to defer that payment to
another date ... It was meant to
concern an alteration in a previous
agreement," the official contended.
The official said use of the section

to justify the University's system was
"freakish." Fie said that related cases
had arisen only rarely; however, he
said, the matter had never been tested
in court.
Under the University's
interpretation, the official said, the
provision could be used as a loophole
for other firms supposedly liable to
the Truth in Lending Act. "It [the
University's interpretation] is
certainly contrary to the spirit of the
law, that I can assure you," he said.
The official asked that he not be
named because, he said, he doubted
that the FTC would pursue any action
against the University. "If we put on
