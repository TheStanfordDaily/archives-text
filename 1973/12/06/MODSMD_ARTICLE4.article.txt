# Student Tuition Deferment Plan Possibly Violates Two Statutes
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The University's system for student
fee deferments, used by at least 2000
p( pie per quarter, may be on shaky
legaf ground, legal sources have told
the Daily.
Some aspects of the system may
violate the Federal Truth in Lending
Act, and may also violate the state
Unruh Act on consumer credit if the
latter statute is applicable.
A Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
official said after examining the
deferment forms that they violated the
Truth in Lending Act by not listing an
annual percentage rate for the finance
charge.
The University has contended that
the disclosure statement on the
deferment forms satisfies a provision
in the regulation for "deferments and
extensions." The forms list the
schedule of payments and the dollar
amounts used in figuring the finance
charge, but do not list an annual
percentage rate.
Former University attorney C.
Ward Cullen, answering complaints
about the system two years ago, cited

section 226.8 (1) of the Truth in
Lending Act, which provides that no
annual percentage rate is necessary on
"deferments or extensions" of
payments. (Percentage rates are
required on virtually all credit
transactions.)
However, the FTC official told the
Daily that the section was not
intended to cover the original terms of
an agreement. "It was meant to
concern the man who, say, is going to
miss the due date of a payment and
just wants to defer that payment to
another date ... It was meant to
concern an alteration in a previous
agreement," the official contended.
The official said use of the section

to justify the University's system was
"freakish." Fie said that related cases
had arisen only rarely; however, he
said, the matter had never been tested
in court.
Under the University's
interpretation, the official said, the
provision could be used as a loophole
for other firms supposedly liable to
the Truth in Lending Act. "It [the
University's interpretation] is
certainly contrary to the spirit of the
law, that I can assure you," he said.
The official asked that he not be
named because, he said, he doubted
that the FTC would pursue any action
against the University. "If we put on
the pressure and got them to change,
so what? All we'd probably earn
would be a censure from Washington.
With our limited funding and
resources, it wouldn't make sense to
spend time on it."
He explained that the commission
lacks the resources to examine every
potential violation, so instead
concentrates on the most serious
situations — for instance, in ghetto
areas.
The purpose of the act is to make
customers aware for comparison
purposes of how much they're paying
for credit. However, the official noted,
the University has no competition in
providing credit for fee deferments.
The Truth in Lending Act does not
concern the actual amount of finance
charges — "You could charge 100
percent sinterest under Truth in
Lending, as long as you properly
disclosed it," remarked the FTC
official — but the state also has its own
consumer credit law, the Unruh Act.
1967 Opinion
Daryl Dawson, an associate staff
counsel in the University's business
and finance office, said a 1967 opinion

from the University's general counsel
— McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enersen of San Francisco — stated that
the University was not subject to the
Unruh Act because it is not a "retail
seller" as defined in the act. However,
another legal source said that the
University's contention was
"arguable."
The Unruh Act covers "retail
sellers" of goods and services except
for stated exemptions, including
physicians, dentists and some others.
Colleges and Universities are not
specifically exempted, but the
University's opinion apparently holds
that Stanford is not a retail seller of its
goods and services — tuition, and room
and board.
Dawson said the ruling had
apparently not been reviewed since
1967, and said he doubted that the
state had been consulted before the
opinion was obtained. He said the
University would not normally seek
such an interpretation.
The legal source told the Daily that
"a case could be made" that the fee
deferment program is in fact subject to
the Unruh Act. If so, then there are
several instances where the program

fails to comply with the act.
For example, since September,
1972 the plan has included a provision
for a $20 late fee if deferments are not
paid off by the final due date of the
quarter. The Unruh Act, however,
declares that a late fee can be no
greater than $5 or five percent of the
outstanding amount, whichever is less.
More Charged
Also, the method the University
uses to calculate the finance charge
sometimes leads to cases where
students are charged more than the act
permits.
For example, finance charges on
deferments paid by the first due date
of the quarter are $1 per $100
deferred, with a minimum charge of
$5 per payment.
Thus, if a student defers $800 and
then pays it off all at once, he is
assessed $8 — less than the maximum
the act allows (1.5 percent per month,
or $12).
However, if the student pays the
same sum in three smaller payments,
he must pay the minimum $5 charge
each time. Thus, he ends up paying
$15, more than the legal maximum.
