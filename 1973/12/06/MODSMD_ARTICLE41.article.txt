# Roble's 'No Place' Pulls No Punches

### SHERIDAN CRAWFORD 
Charles Gordon's "No Place To
Be Somebody" is a very real, very
moving play. The Roble Drama
Workshop's production last week
stayed close to this description,
that is, when the action involved
the black players in the company.
With a couple of exceptions, every
time a white actor appeared on
stage, the play paled to
melodrama.
Perhaps it was the backdrop —
the walls of the Nitery covered in
black cloth — that made the
contrast between characters so
evident. But I think not. The
white actors were not able to lose
themselves in the drama, a part of
their real person still watched the
actions of the character it was
portraying. The black actors, on
the other hand, brought every
part of themselves on stage.
An incredible performance was
given by Keith Calhoun, who
played Gabe Gabriel. His opening
and closing monologues, wherein
the playwright speaks to the
audience, were penetrating. There
was no shrinking back from the
force of his words, spoken straight
from the gut.
Jonathan Ray Ivy as Johnny
Williams, the owner of the bar in
New York City where the action
takes place, gave a taut,
sometimes explosive performance.
He was especially adept at
switching roles as was demanded
of him — from bartender to pimp
to gangster, sometimes a feverish
man, always with the prospect of
violence.
The play centered around the
return of Sweets Crane, an old
buddy of Johnny's, from a long
stint in prison. Charles Ogletree's
performance as the old tired man
whose body, but not spirit, has
been beaten down, carried
through well. He never let the
characterization slip through his
grasp; many of the lesser actors
seemed unable to disguise their
ages, and the character flattened
before your eyes.
I had trouble accepting Shanty
Williams (John Cardosi) as the
not-quite-white drummer who
bartends at Johnny's, but perhaps
it was more a dislike of his
self-consciousness, whether real or
put on. His final speech (Shanty
finally turned white) seemed tc

come out of nowhere since there
did not seem to be sufficient
build-up throughout the play.
Kasey Arnold as Dee Jacobson,
Johnny's prostitute girlfriend, was
more natural. Cora Beasely (Sylvia
Dyson), Shanty's girlfriend, was
vibrant.
The final shoot-out scene was
extremely comic, even silly. The
staging was poor; there didn't
seem to be enough room for
everyone to collapse after the
cap-gun shots. Only Machine
Dog's (T-Bone Powell) fervent
speech to all black brothers and
Gabriel's old woman's lament at
the passing of a people pulled it
out.
Overall, the play had an
amazing effect — great dialogue
with the raising of many voices
which have to be heard.
