# Crafts Faire Offers Unique Wares
## 
### K.C. FLYNN 
A couple of times each year, a
man from San Rafael with a
noticeable twinkle in his eye goes
up into the Sierra foothills and
collects pine cones — enormous
pine cones.
Then the man, whose name is
Holly Peake, returns to his
workshop, carefully yanks out the
scales of the cones, and turns the
scales into tiny wooden seagulls.
Peake, one of the "hard core"
San Francisco craftspeople, was at
Stanford's Christmas Crafts Faire
last weekend selling his birds.
He uses only natural materials
— bits of pine cones, driftwood,
and bark to make his creations.
Pulling the scales out of the cones,
he says, is "a bit like removing a
needle from the back of a
porcupine. You do it very
carefully. You wear gloves, burn
incense, anything to help."
The Christmas Crafts Faire at
Tresidder Union featured more
than 75 craftspeople, including a
dozen potters, some glassworkers,
jewelers, photographers, and other
artists.
Financial Success
It was an enormous financial
success. More than $25,000, twice
the total of last year's Faire, was
collected during four days.
Tresidder kept 20 percent of the
receipts for use in union activities.
The Faire brought Tresidder,
normally a place of un-bussed
serving trays and students in
search of a plane ride, to life.
Outside, the "Baloonwoman"
inflated baloons for kids and
danced as friends played violins
and guitars. Inside, the strange
fragrances of Colin Ingram's
"romantic essences" filled one of
the lounges with the odors of
dozens of spices and plants.
Shoppers played hand-made
"finger pianos" that sounded like
xylophones. A juggler gave
15-minute lessons for a dollar.
And William Wizard, a magician,
performed miraculous and

astonishing feats with a thimble.
The Crafts Faire has become an
important part of the crafts
"circuit" in the Bay Area that
many craftspeople follow. Other
exhibits have as many as 300
participants. In San Francisco, the
Embarcadero Center features
craftspeople every Tuesday.
Widely Traveled Rockhounds
One of the most widely
traveled craftspeople at Tresidder
was Ruth Hunter, a rockhound
who spends weeks at a time in
pursuit sof gemstones from
Phoenix to Portland. She and her
husband canvass the agate fields
of Oregon's volcanic areas in
search of "thunder eggs," plain
looking rocks that reveal opalite
and jasper centers when split
open.
Hunter displayed some
astonishing thunder eggs and
geodes, hollowed rocks with
quartz crystals lining the middle.
She also specializes in pendants of
thin rock slabs.
She and her husband use
diamond saws, grinding wheels,
sanders, and other tools to create
the pendants, which have thin
gold bands around the outside.
Like most craftspeople, she is
interested in doing something
unique. "As far as I know, no one
else is making these pendants,"
she said. "But I suppose if anyone
wanted to work as hard as we do,
they could do it."

Most of the exhibitors were
satisfied with the show and the
response, which was biggest on
Sunday. A few had complaints,
however.
Greg Wooten, a glassmaker
from San Francisco, was one of
17 craftspeople displaced on
Saturday when a previously
scheduled wedding reception took
place in one of the lounges. "It
wasn't very well organized,"
Wooten said. "They had no place
for us to set up our stuff."
Roger Thacker, one of the
Tresidder staff in charge of the
Faire, said that "we tried for a
week to find an alternate space
for the wedding reception, but
couldn't."
Wooten also complained that
he didn't think "the cause was
a very worthwhile one. I don't
like the idea of giving 20 percent
of my income so Stanford
students can have beer blasts."
Pottery Popular
One of the most popular
pottery exhibits at the Faire was
"Mother Earth Pottery," run by
Mardi Sexson and her husband
Tobe, from Los Gatos.
Mother Earth visits many art
shows and exhibits in the Bay
Area and sells pottery to a few
dealers as well as the general
public.
"You could do a show every
weekend," Mardi, Sexson said.

Both she and her husband, a
former engineer, are into pottery
full time. "But you don't want to
get too big. Then you become a
businessman and that's no fun."
Mardi enjoys the art of pottery
and prefers to do "high quality,
one-of-a-kind stuff," she said. "I'd
love to sell a single pot for $20
rather than a bunch of planters
and mugs."
Most of the craftspeople do
not have shops where they sell
their work, Mardi Sexson said.
"Then you become a shopkeeper
and you're back in the world of
business." Some potters hire
others to do their work, and the
shop becomes an assembly line.
We don't want to get that big."
Mostly Older Craftspeople
Few of the craftspeople are
college age kids. "There are a lot
of older, retired people as well as
the middle-aged looking for a new
way to make a living," said
Thacker.
"Actually," one shopper said,
"you can get better quality for
your money at a shop like this.
You're dealing directly with the
craftsmen, not some store."
