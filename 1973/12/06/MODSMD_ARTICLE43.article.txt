# Flexes Symphonic Muscles
## Ozawa's Festive Opener 
### KENNETH DeLONG 
Last Wednesday, the San
Francisco Symphony, now in its
fourth year with conductor Seiji
Ozawa, opened its new season in a
festive mood with works that
flexed the orchestra's symphonic
muscles to the full. The first
music of the season was a sterling
rendition of the national anthem,
scored like Tchaikovsky revisited,
and prominently featuring the
resources of the orchestra's
kitchen department (cymbals,
gong, timpani, etc.)
The first half of the concert
consisted of a complete
performance of Mendelssohn's
incidental music to A Midsummer
Night's Dream. Several selections
of this large work, such as the
Overture, Scherzo, and Wedding
March, have achieved lasting
popularity, but it is not often that

the complete work is heard.
As a special attraction, actress
Rohan McCullough narrated
selected passages from the
Shakespeare play to provide both
flavor and continuity. Her
presence was a decided asset. Not
only did she deliver her lines with
grace and vigor, she also stood
center stage revealing a stunning
facial profile which was widely
appreciated and much applauded.
Words, Music Complementary
The real benefit of Miss
McCullough's performance lay in
the juxtaposition of Shakespeare's
words and Mendelssohn's music.
By and large, incidental music is
successful only by the degree that
it enhances the original play and
captures its spirit in music. Of all
the early Romantics, Mendeissohn
was the most cultured and
intellectually sophisticated, and
his music wonderfully captures
the evanescent and fleeting
quality of Shakespeare's play.
The performance of the music,
although completely adequate,
was not particularly outstanding.
Best performed was the famous
Wedding March, sounding
genuinely regal and full of pomp
when decked out in its original
brilliant orchestral colors. Also
effective were the choral numbers
which were energetic and
disciplined, and notable for good
diction.
Of the two soloists, by far the
better was mezzo-soprano Evelyn
Petros. Her voice is clear and full,
and added measurably to the
performance. Soprano Lorene
Adams was barely adequate, and
only partially audible. In the
main, the music was successfully
performed and the season started
on a bright and cheery note.
The second number on the
program was Arnold Schoenberg's
Modern Psalm, scored for
orchestra, chorus, and featuring a
"Sprechstimme" soloist. The
piece divides the text into three
sections, stated first by the soloist
and repeated by the chorus. This
piece is Schoenberg's last

composition, and in my opinion a
very fine one. Although it uses
both singing and "Sprechstimme,"
there is little of Schoenberg's
early expressionist emotionalism.
Instead there are clean clear
contrapuntal melodic lines and
smooth-sounding rhythms.
Outstanding Chorus
The newly-formed San
Francisco Symphony Chorus was
particularly outstanding in a
difficult assignment. Soloist
Andrew Foldi was also good,
revealing a good understanding of
the "Sprechstimme" style. It is a
mystery why this should be the
American premiere of such a fine
work by a major twentieth
century composer.
Concluding the program was a
performance of Leos Janacek's
Sinfonietta. This piece (Janacek's
last completed orchestral
composition), started life as a set
of brass fanfares composed for a
Prague gymnastics festival. Each
of the five movements is scored
for a different orchestral group,
the whole being framed by the
brass fanfares. For these fanfares,
the brass section of the
Symphony moved to special
risers. The effect was truly
thrilling.
This noisy, brilliantly scored
piece filled with modal folk tunes
is really Ozawa's kind of music,
and it received excellent
treatment from his hands. Ozawa
conducted the piece from score,
as usual forgetting to turn even
the first page. His poise and
command is remarkable and
nearly always results in a good
show.
From the opening overture to
the concluding fanfare, the
concert was an expression of
buoyant good spirits and
festiveness. In all, a fine opening
to the new season.

performance of Leos Janacek's
Sinfonietta. This piece (Janacek's
last completed orchestral
composition), started life as a set
of brass fanfares composed for a
Prague gymnastics festival. Each
of the five movements is scored
for a different orchestral group,
the whole being framed by the
brass fanfares. For these fanfares,
the brass section of the
Symphony moved to special
risers. The effect was truly
thrilling.
This noisy, brilliantly scored
piece filled with modal folk tunes
is really Ozawa's kind of music,
and it received excellent
treatment from his hands. Ozawa
conducted the piece from score,
as usual forgetting to turn even
the first page. His poise and
command is remarkable and
nearly always results in a good
show.
From the opening overture to
the concluding fanfare, the
concert was an expression of
buoyant good spirits and
festiveness. In all, a fine opening
to the new season.
Last Wednesday, the San
Francisco Symphony, now in its
fourth year with conductor Seiji
Ozawa, opened its new season in a
festive mood with works that
flexed the orchestra's symphonic
muscles to the full. The first
music of the season was a sterling
rendition of the national anthem,
scored like Tchaikovsky revisited,
and prominently featuring the
resources of the orchestra's
kitchen department (cymbals,
gong, timpani, etc.)
The first half of the concert
consisted of a complete
performance of Mendelssohn's
incidental music to A Midsummer
Night's Dream. Several selections
of this large work, such as the
Overture, Scherzo, and Wedding
March, have achieved lasting
popularity, but it is not often that

the complete work is heard.
As a special attraction, actress
Rohan McCullough narrated
selected passages from the
Shakespeare play to provide both
flavor and continuity. Her
presence was a decided asset. Not
only did she deliver her lines with
grace and vigor, she also stood
center stage revealing a stunning
facial profile which was widely
appreciated and much applauded.
Words, Music Complementary
The real benefit of Miss
McCullough's performance lay in
the juxtaposition of Shakespeare's
words and Mendelssohn's music.
By and large, incidental music is
successful only by the degree that
it enhances the original play and
captures its spirit in music. Of all
the early Romantics, Mendeissohn
was the most cultured and
intellectually sophisticated, and
his music wonderfully captures
the evanescent and fleeting
quality of Shakespeare's play.
The performance of the music,
although completely adequate,
was not particularly outstanding.
Best performed was the famous
Wedding March, sounding
genuinely regal and full of pomp
when decked out in its original
brilliant orchestral colors. Also
effective were the choral numbers
which were energetic and
disciplined, and notable for good
diction.
Of the two soloists, by far the
better was mezzo-soprano Evelyn
Petros. Her voice is clear and full,
and added measurably to the
performance. Soprano Lorene
Adams was barely adequate, and
only partially audible. In the
main, the music was successfully
performed and the season started
on a bright and cheery note.
The second number on the
program was Arnold Schoenberg's
Modern Psalm, scored for
orchestra, chorus, and featuring a
"Sprechstimme" soloist. The
piece divides the text into three
sections, stated first by the soloist
and repeated by the chorus. This
piece is Schoenberg's last

composition, and in my opinion a
very fine one. Although it uses
both singing and "Sprechstimme,"
there is little of Schoenberg's
early expressionist emotionalism.
Instead there are clean clear
contrapuntal melodic lines and
smooth-sounding rhythms.
Outstanding Chorus
The newly-formed San
Francisco Symphony Chorus was
particularly outstanding in a
difficult assignment. Soloist
Andrew Foldi was also good,
revealing a good understanding of
the "Sprechstimme" style. It is a
mystery why this should be the
American premiere of such a fine
work by a major twentieth
century composer.
Concluding the program was a
performance of Leos Janacek's
Sinfonietta. This piece (Janacek's

composition), started life as a set
