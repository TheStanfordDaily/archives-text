# Backstage With Albert King: Two Views
## ‘I’ll Play The Blues For You' 
### DAN FORTE 
Everything about Albert King
is big. He stands 6-5 and weights
about 260. He tours the country
in a Greyhound Scenie Cruiser
which he drives himself.
Up until the time of his first
LP for Stax, Albert continued to
drive a bulldozer in the daytime,
playing guitar at nights. As he has
always said, "If this music
business doesn't work out, I'll just
go back to driving the bulldozer."
u At this point, there's no doubt
"that music is working out for
;? Albert.
He wades through audiences at
■night clubs and concert halls all
(over the world, greeting his fans
with a wide smile and a handshake
that completely swallows most
hands. He wears to
diamond-studded little finger rings
that could serve as bracelets for
most.
Albert King, now 49, has been
playing the blues off and on for
the past 27 years. He first stepped
onto the stage of the Fillmore
Auditorium in 1968, on what was
possibly Bill Graham's most
star-studded show, preceding John
Mayall and Jimi Hendrix.
It was there that Albert
became the first "flower power
blues guitarist." As Rolling
Stone's Jerold Greenberg put it,
"Albert King was the only one
who could play on the full
emotional range of his audience."
Upside-Down Guitar
Although Albert plays an
upside-down guitar (he is
left-handed, but his guitar is
strung right-handed), he is
considered one of the best blues
guitarists alive. In 1970 he was
guest artists with the St. Louis

Symphony.
Because of his last name, much
confusion has always surrounded
Albert, and his relationship to
Freddie King and 8.8. King.
Both Albert and 8.8. were
born in Indianola, Miss. 8.8.'s
father is named Albert, so it seems
quite possible that they could be
half-brothers; nobody's really
sure. (Freddie is from Texas.)
Comparisons between Albert
and 8.8. have become a
controversy of sorts in blues
circles. In '71 the audience at
Fillmore West got to see the
differences firsthand, when the
two Kings appeared on the same
show, and jammed together.
Unlike most jams of recent
years, the Albert-8.8. stand-off
was reminiscent of the jazz
"cutting sessions" of the 30s and
40s.
In this case, the hands-down
"winner" proved to be Albert.
8.8.'s short, subtle riffs were no
match for Albert's forceful,
note-packed runs.
Tired Of Shadow
Not that the jam was any sort
of personal vendetta, but Albert
is, obviously a bit tired of living in
the shadow of the more
prosperous 8.8.
Speaking of the present band,
Albert says, "I've got a guitar
player here that can play 8.8.
note for note. I want to see us and
8.8. on a show together, and he'll
get out there and play 8.8., and
then I'll do my stuff, then I want
to see what 8.8.'s gonna do." He
punctuates the end of the
sentence with a huge laugh.
Saturday night, the Albert
King Review kicked off their set
with a fine version of "Coming

Home, Baby," led by organist
James Washington who has been
with Albert for over eight years.
Soul Sister
The Review then brought out
its soul sister, Big Ella Tate, with
Quincy Jones' "Money Runner."
Big Ella sang a few soul
numbers, like "Superstition" and
"Daddy Could Swear," and also a
fine vocal duet on "Wee Baby
Blues," with Albert's understudy,
guitarist Donald Kinsey.
The rest of the band includes
Wilbur Thompson (trumpet),
Erent Watson (tenor), Lannie
Turner (drums), and John Riley
(bass).
Albert took the stage,
strapping on his "Flying V"

guitar, and proceeded to
demonstrate his deep, rough
voice, and delicate, whining guitar
for well over an hour.
During the set, Albert handled
both blues and some funkier,
soulish tunes, like "Don't Burn
Down The Bridge" and "Breaking
Up Somebody's Home," with
total authority.
'Blues Power' Monologue
Albert is famous for his blues
monologues, and told the Maples
audience just what the blues is
about on "Blues Power."
Closing the show with his new
hit "I'll Play The Blues For You,"
Albert returned for a
well-deserved encore, "Please
Love Me."
There are many capable blues
guitarists working today, but none
are better than Albert King.
As Albert said in his last song
of the set:
"I ain't got no big name;
Lord, and I ain't no big star.
But, I'll play the blues for you
On my guitar."

business doesn't work out, I'll just
go back to driving the bulldozer."
u At this point, there's no doubt
"that music is working out for
;? Albert.
He wades through audiences at
■night clubs and concert halls all
(over the world, greeting his fans
with a wide smile and a handshake
that completely swallows most
hands. He wears to
diamond-studded little finger rings
that could serve as bracelets for
most.
Albert King, now 49, has been
playing the blues off and on for
the past 27 years. He first stepped
onto the stage of the Fillmore
Auditorium in 1968, on what was
possibly Bill Graham's most
star-studded show, preceding John
Mayall and Jimi Hendrix.
It was there that Albert
became the first "flower power
blues guitarist." As Rolling
Stone's Jerold Greenberg put it,
"Albert King was the only one
who could play on the full
emotional range of his audience."
Upside-Down Guitar
Although Albert plays an
upside-down guitar (he is
left-handed, but his guitar is
strung right-handed), he is
considered one of the best blues
guitarists alive. In 1970 he was
guest artists with the St. Louis

Symphony.
Because of his last name, much
confusion has always surrounded
Albert, and his relationship to
Freddie King and 8.8. King.
Both Albert and 8.8. were
born in Indianola, Miss. 8.8.'s
father is named Albert, so it seems
quite possible that they could be
half-brothers; nobody's really
sure. (Freddie is from Texas.)
Comparisons between Albert
and 8.8. have become a
controversy of sorts in blues
circles. In '71 the audience at
Fillmore West got to see the
differences firsthand, when the
two Kings appeared on the same
show, and jammed together.
Unlike most jams of recent
years, the Albert-8.8. stand-off
was reminiscent of the jazz
"cutting sessions" of the 30s and
40s.
In this case, the hands-down
"winner" proved to be Albert.
8.8.'s short, subtle riffs were no
match for Albert's forceful,
note-packed runs.
Tired Of Shadow
Not that the jam was any sort
of personal vendetta, but Albert
is, obviously a bit tired of living in
the shadow of the more
prosperous 8.8.
Speaking of the present band,
Albert says, "I've got a guitar
player here that can play 8.8.
note for note. I want to see us and
8.8. on a show together, and he'll
get out there and play 8.8., and
then I'll do my stuff, then I want
to see what 8.8.'s gonna do." He
punctuates the end of the
sentence with a huge laugh.
Saturday night, the Albert
King Review kicked off their set
with a fine version of "Coming

Home, Baby," led by organist
James Washington who has been
with Albert for over eight years.
Soul Sister
The Review then brought out
its soul sister, Big Ella Tate, with
Quincy Jones' "Money Runner."
Big Ella sang a few soul
numbers, like "Superstition" and
"Daddy Could Swear," and also a
fine vocal duet on "Wee Baby
Blues," with Albert's understudy,
guitarist Donald Kinsey.
The rest of the band includes
Wilbur Thompson (trumpet),
Erent Watson (tenor), Lannie
Turner (drums), and John Riley
(bass).
Albert took the stage,
strapping on his "Flying V"

guitar, and proceeded to
demonstrate his deep, rough
voice, and delicate, whining guitar
for well over an hour.
During the set, Albert handled
both blues and some funkier,
soulish tunes, like "Don't Burn
Down The Bridge" and "Breaking
Up Somebody's Home," with
total authority.
'Blues Power' Monologue
Albert is famous for his blues
monologues, and told the Maples
audience just what the blues is
about on "Blues Power."
Closing the show with his new
hit "I'll Play The Blues For You,"
Albert returned for a
well-deserved encore, "Please
Love Me."
There are many capable blues
guitarists working today, but none
are better than Albert King.
As Albert said in his last song
of the set:
"I ain't got no big name;
Lord, and I ain't no big star.
But, I'll play the blues for you
On my guitar."

BLUES GlANT—Guitarist and singer Albert King, unquestionably one
of the giants of the blues, gave an excellent performance last Saturday
to a sparse audience in Maples Pavilion.
Everything about Albert King
is big. He stands 6-5 and weights
about 260. He tours the country
in a Greyhound Scenie Cruiser
which he drives himself.
Up until the time of his first
LP for Stax, Albert continued to
drive a bulldozer in the daytime,
playing guitar at nights. As he has

that could serve as bracelets for
most.
Albert King, now 49, has been
playing the blues off and on for
the past 27 years. He first stepped
onto the stage of the Fillmore
Auditorium in 1968, on what was
possibly Bill Graham's most
star-studded show, preceding John
Mayall and Jimi Hendrix.
It was there that Albert
became the first "flower power
blues guitarist." As Rolling
Stone's Jerold Greenberg put it,
"Albert King was the only one
who could play on the full
emotional range of his audience."
Upside-Down Guitar
Although Albert plays an
upside-down guitar (he is
left-handed, but his guitar is
strung right-handed), he is
considered one of the best blues
guitarists alive. In 1970 he was
guest artists with the St. Louis

Symphony.
Because of his last name, much
confusion has always surrounded
Albert, and his relationship to
Freddie King and 8.8. King.
Both Albert and 8.8. were
born in Indianola, Miss. 8.8.'s
father is named Albert, so it seems
quite possible that they could be
half-brothers; nobody's really
sure. (Freddie is from Texas.)
Comparisons between Albert
and 8.8. have become a
controversy of sorts in blues
circles. In '71 the audience at
Fillmore West got to see the
differences firsthand, when the
two Kings appeared on the same
show, and jammed together.
Unlike most jams of recent
years, the Albert-8.8. stand-off
was reminiscent of the jazz
"cutting sessions" of the 30s and
40s.
In this case, the hands-down
"winner" proved to be Albert.
8.8.'s short, subtle riffs were no
match for Albert's forceful,
note-packed runs.
Tired Of Shadow
Not that the jam was any sort
of personal vendetta, but Albert
is, obviously a bit tired of living in
the shadow of the more
prosperous 8.8.
Speaking of the present band,
Albert says, "I've got a guitar
player here that can play 8.8.
note for note. I want to see us and
8.8. on a show together, and he'll
get out there and play 8.8., and
then I'll do my stuff, then I want
to see what 8.8.'s gonna do." He
punctuates the end of the
sentence with a huge laugh.
Saturday night, the Albert
King Review kicked off their set
with a fine version of "Coming

Home, Baby," led by organist
James Washington who has been
with Albert for over eight years.
Soul Sister
The Review then brought out
its soul sister, Big Ella Tate, with
Quincy Jones' "Money Runner."
Big Ella sang a few soul
numbers, like "Superstition" and
"Daddy Could Swear," and also a
fine vocal duet on "Wee Baby
Blues," with Albert's understudy,
guitarist Donald Kinsey.
The rest of the band includes
Wilbur Thompson (trumpet),
Erent Watson (tenor), Lannie
Turner (drums), and John Riley
(bass).
Albert took the stage,
strapping on his "Flying V"

guitar, and proceeded to
demonstrate his deep, rough
voice, and delicate, whining guitar
for well over an hour.
During the set, Albert handled
both blues and some funkier,
soulish tunes, like "Don't Burn
Down The Bridge" and "Breaking
Up Somebody's Home," with
total authority.
'Blues Power' Monologue
Albert is famous for his blues
monologues, and told the Maples
audience just what the blues is
about on "Blues Power."
Closing the show with his new
hit "I'll Play The Blues For You,"
Albert returned for a
well-deserved encore, "Please
Love Me."
There are many capable blues
guitarists working today, but none
are better than Albert King.
As Albert said in his last song
of the set:
"I ain't got no big name;
Lord, and I ain't no big star.
But, I'll play the blues for you
On my guitar."

BLUES GlANT—Guitarist and singer Albert King, unquestionably one
of the giants of the blues, gave an excellent performance last Saturday
to a sparse audience in Maples Pavilion.
Everything about Albert King
is big. He stands 6-5 and weights
about 260. He tours the country
in a Greyhound Scenie Cruiser
which he drives himself.
Up until the time of his first
LP for Stax, Albert continued to
drive a bulldozer in the daytime,
playing guitar at nights. As he has
always said, "If this music
business doesn't work out, I'll just
go back to driving the bulldozer."
u At this point, there's no doubt
"that music is working out for
;? Albert.
He wades through audiences at
■night clubs and concert halls all
(over the world, greeting his fans
with a wide smile and a handshake
that completely swallows most
hands. He wears to
diamond-studded little finger rings
that could serve as bracelets for
most.
