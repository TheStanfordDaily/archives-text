# In The Color And The The Noise
## Hot Tuna: There Somewhere 
### JAY HARLOW 
Several thousand more people
could have fit into Maples Pavilion
pÂ«,Jjox, the ASSU Special Events
concert Saturday night than did.
Those thousands missed some
excellent blues and rock music
\ from the Albert King Review and
Bloomfield/Naftajin, and a very
loud drummer.
Hot Tuna was the headlining
act, and apparently did play.
However, the excellent guitar-bass
duo of Jorma Kaukonen and Jack
Cassady, the nucleus of Hot Tuna,
was completely over-powered by
drummer Sammy Piazza, who
seemed to think he was trying to
fill the Oakland Coliseum without
amplification.
Kaukonen and Cassady were
not exactly playing quietly
themselves. The whole sound level
was higher than necessary (it was
even loud in the men's room), but
the drums were mixed in way too
loud.
Occasionally, some music did
get through the racket. The
opener, "I Know You Rider,"
demonstrated the melodic and
rhythmic skill of Kaukonen and
Cassady which made thier first
acoustic album so good.
Unfortunately, this and numbers

like "Hesitation Blues" and Rev.
Gary Davis' "I'll Be All Right"
were the exception rather than
the rule.
Two New Albums
The band introduced tunes
from two upcoming albums, one
of which will feature acoustic
guitar, the other electric. Some of
these sounded interesting,
including "I've See the Light" and
"Seaweed Strut," but I'll have to
hear the recorded versions to be
sure.
Along about the end of Hot
Tuna's second hour, Piazza's
mindless bashing succeeded in
turning my brain into putty, and I
stumbled out of Maples, ears
ringing. I am told they played for
nearly an hour more, and I admire
those who stayed for their
remarkably high pain thresholds.
I am looking forward to
hearing their new albums,
especially the acoustic one. Their
first album, all acoustic and
recorded live in a Berkeley night
club, remains their best in my
mind.
Hot Tuna was preceded by two
different blues acts, the Albert
King Review and Bloomfield/
Naftalin. (See the two reviews of
Albert King above.)
White Blues Veterans
Michael Bloomfield and Mark
Naftalin are both veterans of the
Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the
first of the young white urban
blues bands of the 60s. Since
then, both have done mainly

Jay Harlow

session work, each having a
discography that spans a wide
Spectrum of rock and blues. The
two have recently teamed up with
bassist-singer Roger "Jelly Roll"
Troy to produce a first-rate band.
Their repertoire includes blues,
rhythm-and-blues, and more
recent rock styles.
Bloomfield's guitar work has
never been a question mark, and
Saturday's concert was no
exception. His blues licks strike a
perfect balance between
simplicity and complexity, never
boring nor so far out as to be
inaccessible.
Naftalin's keyboards
complemented Bloomfield's guitar
at every point, whether it was
long, rich organ notes on the slow
blues numbers or bouncing boogie
woogie figures on the faster tunes.
Several times he combined the
two, laying down an organ
foundation with his left hand and
playing piano runs and fill-ins
with his right.
"Jelly Roll" looks and sounds
a bit like David Clayton-Thomas,
but is a less pretentious and more
satisfying blues singer. His singing
of the opening song, Ray Charles'
"Unchain My Heart," was
first-rate. Bloomfield and Naftalin
also sang, with the latter doing the
encore, "Overton Mountain," an
old rock & roll tune recorded by
Jerry Lee Lewis and others.
