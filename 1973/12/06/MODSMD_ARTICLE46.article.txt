# 'About Ready To Get Outâ€™
## 
### CHRISTOPHER TOREM 
"I'm about ready to get out of this business,"
Albert King grumbled backstage before the Maples
show Friday night. "There's no excitement here for
me anymore." .
At the age of 49, the man who claims to have
"invented blues power," was thinking of hanging up
his guitar for good and spending his time with his
new baby, the brand-new Lovejoy Productions
recording company. Maybe two or three more years
and he could finish out his contracts and settle
down for a while, watch somebody else sweat it out
in front of the crowds while remembering which
planes to catch and which hotels to book.
"I've been wanting to get out for a long time,"
Albert said, lifting one heavy ring finger to scratch
near the red AK monograph on his shirt lapel. "I
didn't cut out before because I just wasn't prepared.
I wasn't ready for it in any way you can imagine."
He eased himself onto the back table in the
gymnasium dressing room and closed his eyes. His
movements seemed as ponderous and smooth as the
shifting of well-oiled gears on the big trucks he used
to drive. Twenty-six years on the road and it was
time for a long pit stop.
Beer Cups, Guitar Cases
Somebody had hung up red, green, and blue
India prints to disguise the antiseptic drabness of
the walls. The room still smelled of sweat. The beer
cups and guitar cases scattered on the floor seemed
to merge in one dry-mouthed swallow of a
hangover.
Out in the hall, the members of the Albert King
Review were pacing off the pre-set show jitters and
listening to the white electric blues sound of
Bloomfield-Naftalan. One-armed Wilbert Thompson,
the sought-after veteran trumpet player of the
Review, crouched low to avoid intruders and to
force out those first few opening notes which get
the saliva circulating and the cheeks rattling.
Albert, who always has a bit more time to wait
than his band before he goes on, cocked a sleepy
eye over one shiny brown shoe. "Hey, where's that
promoter? I want to see him right now," he said.
In a few moments, the promoter, a thin, nervous
longhair in an open white shirt, long mod boots and
jeans, bowed into the room. "What's the matter? Is
there anything wrong?" he asked.
"Just want to check on the money," growled
Albert. Within seconds, the money changed hands
and Albert could stretch his good-sized frame back
down along the narrow board.
Long Afternoon
It had been a long afternoon for the band,
driving around the big campus looking for some
place called Maples Pavilion that for some reason
nobody asked had ever heard of, and arriving only
to find that one of the back-up guitars was missing.
That same night, it would be time to hop a plane for
Memphis Tennessee.
"Whew, I'm tired," said Albert. "All I want is to
do it and get out of here."

When Albert finally climbed up to the part of the
stage hidden by the giant speakers, Big Ella was
already shaking up the crowd, which had been
strangely quiet during Mike Bloomfield's smooth,
multi-note performance. Ella, a night-club success in
her own right, has been with Albert's band for six
years, long enough to consider herself his "artist,"
even though she's usually on stage just long enough
to warm up the place for "Blues Power."
Albert sat quietly through the performance,
tapping his foot ever so slightly, puffing on his pipe,
and staring impassively through the little blond
groupie showing off her hips to a nearby friend.
Finally, Albert rose to his feet and reached for the
big case with the rope tied around the center to
keep the guitar in and other hands out.
He started sluggishly, his voice low and the guitar
soft. Then, almost as if some professional button
was popped, or because the band was feeling good
that evening, Albert began to play.
When Albert King gets it on with his
rocket-droped guitar, there's not a tigher, cleaner,
sparer use of the blues riff around. He wastes almost
nothing, stretching each note out in a dance that
seems to climb and bend until the room seems to
hum with concentrated energy. He's been working
on that same set of riffs for so long that each song is
only a re-working of his own "Bluespower,"
whether he's playing "Watermelon Man" on the
lead-in, "Born Under a Bad Sign" or "Don't Break
Up My Home." His monologue for "Bluespower,"
the cut that made him nationally famous, also never
changes.
".. . There's this girl and she's got this main
squeeze, that's her boy friend that is . . . And he just
bought a brand new GTO . . . and this particular
night her mother says to her . . . you can't go out
tonight daughter, that's too many nights in a row
. . . Well, she goes to her room, won't eat, won't
sleep, won't see nobody . . . she's got the blues. . .
"Every body know what I mean? . . . Everybody
say Yeah. . . ." And here as elsewhre, the crowd,
mostly long-haired, middle-class whites, started
leaping up and down and yelling.
Albert leaned back and grinned. He began to
shuffle his feet and by the time the next version of
"Bluespower" had come around again, he was
dancing, an ungainly heavyweight with some
practiced sense of grace that made it all seem
natural.
In the corner, Ella smiled in relief. "He's all right
now," she said. "You can tell when he's unhappy.
He starts grumbling and arguing to himself.
Everybody knows that the sound isn't right."
As the set ended, Albert waved his hands in two
wide V-signs. Under the wide-brimmed hat, he was
sweating heavily. Naturally, the crowd wanted an
encore.
At the foot of the stage, Mike Bloomfield stood
in rapt attention to Albert's playing. He definitely
didn't want to answer questions during the set.
"Stop it,"he said. "I'm watching Albert King!"

force out those first few opening notes which get
the saliva circulating and the cheeks rattling.
Albert, who always has a bit more time to wait
than his band before he goes on, cocked a sleepy
eye over one shiny brown shoe. "Hey, where's that
promoter? I want to see him right now," he said.
In a few moments, the promoter, a thin, nervous
longhair in an open white shirt, long mod boots and
jeans, bowed into the room. "What's the matter? Is
there anything wrong?" he asked.
"Just want to check on the money," growled
Albert. Within seconds, the money changed hands
and Albert could stretch his good-sized frame back
down along the narrow board.
Long Afternoon
It had been a long afternoon for the band,
driving around the big campus looking for some
place called Maples Pavilion that for some reason
nobody asked had ever heard of, and arriving only
to find that one of the back-up guitars was missing.
That same night, it would be time to hop a plane for
Memphis Tennessee.
"Whew, I'm tired," said Albert. "All I want is to
do it and get out of here."

When Albert finally climbed up to the part of the
stage hidden by the giant speakers, Big Ella was
already shaking up the crowd, which had been
strangely quiet during Mike Bloomfield's smooth,
multi-note performance. Ella, a night-club success in
her own right, has been with Albert's band for six
years, long enough to consider herself his "artist,"
even though she's usually on stage just long enough
to warm up the place for "Blues Power."
Albert sat quietly through the performance,
tapping his foot ever so slightly, puffing on his pipe,
and staring impassively through the little blond
groupie showing off her hips to a nearby friend.
Finally, Albert rose to his feet and reached for the
big case with the rope tied around the center to
keep the guitar in and other hands out.
He started sluggishly, his voice low and the guitar
soft. Then, almost as if some professional button
was popped, or because the band was feeling good
that evening, Albert began to play.
When Albert King gets it on with his
rocket-droped guitar, there's not a tigher, cleaner,
sparer use of the blues riff around. He wastes almost
nothing, stretching each note out in a dance that
seems to climb and bend until the room seems to
hum with concentrated energy. He's been working
on that same set of riffs for so long that each song is
only a re-working of his own "Bluespower,"
whether he's playing "Watermelon Man" on the
lead-in, "Born Under a Bad Sign" or "Don't Break
Up My Home." His monologue for "Bluespower,"
the cut that made him nationally famous, also never
changes.
".. . There's this girl and she's got this main
squeeze, that's her boy friend that is . . . And he just
bought a brand new GTO . . . and this particular
night her mother says to her . . . you can't go out
tonight daughter, that's too many nights in a row
. . . Well, she goes to her room, won't eat, won't
sleep, won't see nobody . . . she's got the blues. . .
"Every body know what I mean? . . . Everybody
say Yeah. . . ." And here as elsewhre, the crowd,
mostly long-haired, middle-class whites, started
leaping up and down and yelling.
Albert leaned back and grinned. He began to
shuffle his feet and by the time the next version of
"Bluespower" had come around again, he was
dancing, an ungainly heavyweight with some
practiced sense of grace that made it all seem
natural.
In the corner, Ella smiled in relief. "He's all right
now," she said. "You can tell when he's unhappy.
He starts grumbling and arguing to himself.
Everybody knows that the sound isn't right."
As the set ended, Albert waved his hands in two
wide V-signs. Under the wide-brimmed hat, he was
sweating heavily. Naturally, the crowd wanted an
encore.
At the foot of the stage, Mike Bloomfield stood
in rapt attention to Albert's playing. He definitely
didn't want to answer questions during the set.
"Stop it,"he said. "I'm watching Albert King!"
"I'm about ready to get out of this business,"
Albert King grumbled backstage before the Maples
show Friday night. "There's no excitement here for
me anymore." .
At the age of 49, the man who claims to have
"invented blues power," was thinking of hanging up
his guitar for good and spending his time with his
new baby, the brand-new Lovejoy Productions
recording company. Maybe two or three more years
and he could finish out his contracts and settle
down for a while, watch somebody else sweat it out
in front of the crowds while remembering which
planes to catch and which hotels to book.
"I've been wanting to get out for a long time,"
Albert said, lifting one heavy ring finger to scratch
near the red AK monograph on his shirt lapel. "I
didn't cut out before because I just wasn't prepared.
I wasn't ready for it in any way you can imagine."
He eased himself onto the back table in the
gymnasium dressing room and closed his eyes. His
movements seemed as ponderous and smooth as the
shifting of well-oiled gears on the big trucks he used
to drive. Twenty-six years on the road and it was
time for a long pit stop.
Beer Cups, Guitar Cases
Somebody had hung up red, green, and blue
India prints to disguise the antiseptic drabness of
the walls. The room still smelled of sweat. The beer
cups and guitar cases scattered on the floor seemed
to merge in one dry-mouthed swallow of a
hangover.
Out in the hall, the members of the Albert King
Review were pacing off the pre-set show jitters and
listening to the white electric blues sound of
Bloomfield-Naftalan. One-armed Wilbert Thompson,
the sought-after veteran trumpet player of the
Review, crouched low to avoid intruders and to
force out those first few opening notes which get
the saliva circulating and the cheeks rattling.
Albert, who always has a bit more time to wait

Finally, Albert rose to his feet and reached for the
big case with the rope tied around the center to
keep the guitar in and other hands out.
He started sluggishly, his voice low and the guitar
soft. Then, almost as if some professional button
was popped, or because the band was feeling good
that evening, Albert began to play.
When Albert King gets it on with his
rocket-droped guitar, there's not a tigher, cleaner,
sparer use of the blues riff around. He wastes almost
nothing, stretching each note out in a dance that
seems to climb and bend until the room seems to
hum with concentrated energy. He's been working
on that same set of riffs for so long that each song is
only a re-working of his own "Bluespower,"
whether he's playing "Watermelon Man" on the
lead-in, "Born Under a Bad Sign" or "Don't Break
Up My Home." His monologue for "Bluespower,"
the cut that made him nationally famous, also never
changes.
".. . There's this girl and she's got this main
squeeze, that's her boy friend that is . . . And he just
bought a brand new GTO . . . and this particular
night her mother says to her . . . you can't go out
tonight daughter, that's too many nights in a row
. . . Well, she goes to her room, won't eat, won't
sleep, won't see nobody . . . she's got the blues. . .
"Every body know what I mean? . . . Everybody
say Yeah. . . ." And here as elsewhre, the crowd,
mostly long-haired, middle-class whites, started
leaping up and down and yelling.
Albert leaned back and grinned. He began to
shuffle his feet and by the time the next version of
"Bluespower" had come around again, he was
dancing, an ungainly heavyweight with some
practiced sense of grace that made it all seem
natural.
In the corner, Ella smiled in relief. "He's all right
now," she said. "You can tell when he's unhappy.
He starts grumbling and arguing to himself.
Everybody knows that the sound isn't right."
As the set ended, Albert waved his hands in two
wide V-signs. Under the wide-brimmed hat, he was
sweating heavily. Naturally, the crowd wanted an
encore.
At the foot of the stage, Mike Bloomfield stood
in rapt attention to Albert's playing. He definitely
didn't want to answer questions during the set.
"Stop it,"he said. "I'm watching Albert King!"
"I'm about ready to get out of this business,"
Albert King grumbled backstage before the Maples
show Friday night. "There's no excitement here for
me anymore." .
At the age of 49, the man who claims to have
"invented blues power," was thinking of hanging up
his guitar for good and spending his time with his
new baby, the brand-new Lovejoy Productions
recording company. Maybe two or three more years
and he could finish out his contracts and settle
down for a while, watch somebody else sweat it out
in front of the crowds while remembering which
planes to catch and which hotels to book.
"I've been wanting to get out for a long time,"
Albert said, lifting one heavy ring finger to scratch
near the red AK monograph on his shirt lapel. "I
didn't cut out before because I just wasn't prepared.
I wasn't ready for it in any way you can imagine."
He eased himself onto the back table in the
gymnasium dressing room and closed his eyes. His
movements seemed as ponderous and smooth as the
shifting of well-oiled gears on the big trucks he used
to drive. Twenty-six years on the road and it was
time for a long pit stop.
Beer Cups, Guitar Cases
Somebody had hung up red, green, and blue
India prints to disguise the antiseptic drabness of
the walls. The room still smelled of sweat. The beer
cups and guitar cases scattered on the floor seemed
to merge in one dry-mouthed swallow of a
hangover.
Out in the hall, the members of the Albert King
Review were pacing off the pre-set show jitters and
listening to the white electric blues sound of
Bloomfield-Naftalan. One-armed Wilbert Thompson,
the sought-after veteran trumpet player of the
Review, crouched low to avoid intruders and to
force out those first few opening notes which get
the saliva circulating and the cheeks rattling.
Albert, who always has a bit more time to wait
than his band before he goes on, cocked a sleepy
eye over one shiny brown shoe. "Hey, where's that
promoter? I want to see him right now," he said.
In a few moments, the promoter, a thin, nervous
longhair in an open white shirt, long mod boots and
jeans, bowed into the room. "What's the matter? Is
there anything wrong?" he asked.
"Just want to check on the money," growled
Albert. Within seconds, the money changed hands
and Albert could stretch his good-sized frame back
down along the narrow board.
Long Afternoon
It had been a long afternoon for the band,
driving around the big campus looking for some
place called Maples Pavilion that for some reason
nobody asked had ever heard of, and arriving only
to find that one of the back-up guitars was missing.
That same night, it would be time to hop a plane for
Memphis Tennessee.
"Whew, I'm tired," said Albert. "All I want is to
do it and get out of here."

When Albert finally climbed up to the part of the
stage hidden by the giant speakers, Big Ella was
already shaking up the crowd, which had been
strangely quiet during Mike Bloomfield's smooth,
multi-note performance. Ella, a night-club success in
her own right, has been with Albert's band for six
years, long enough to consider herself his "artist,"
even though she's usually on stage just long enough
to warm up the place for "Blues Power."
Albert sat quietly through the performance,
tapping his foot ever so slightly, puffing on his pipe,
and staring impassively through the little blond
groupie showing off her hips to a nearby friend.
Finally, Albert rose to his feet and reached for the
big case with the rope tied around the center to
keep the guitar in and other hands out.
