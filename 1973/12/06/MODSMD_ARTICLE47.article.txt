# ‘Revolt Of The Cockroach People ’ Shows Human Side Of A Movement
## 
### 
The Revolt of the Cockroach People
by Oscar Zeta Acosta
Straight Arrow Books
By GEORGE POWELL
This is not a science-fiction book, although
Oscar Z. Acosta's life has certainly had a
surreal quality about it. For those unfamiliar
with Acosta, he is also known as Dr. Gonzo,
Hunter Thompson's "Samoan" lawyer, who
was the bigger, if not better half of Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas.
Acosta has himself written another book
The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo,
which detailed the struggles of a Chicano lad
growing up in the San Joaquin Valley and
coming to grips with the world, various drugs,
religion, the law and sex, in no particular
order.
Cockroach People takes up where the last
book left off, in 1968, when Acosta
determined to go to Los Angeles and write the
story of the Mexican-Americans' struggle
against the establishment. Instead of writing,
Acosta ended up serving as the movement's
lawyer, arguing cases that meant as much to
Chicanos as the Chicago Seven trial did to
white middle class protesters.
Acosta also found time during all the
turmoil to run for sheriff of Los Angeles
County, finishing second in the 1970 primary
with nearly 500,000 votes.

But all the turmoil, trials and pressures of
being a radical lawyer took their toll, and
according to the book jacket blurb, Acosta
finally sacrifices his sanity for the cause of the
cockroach people.
A close reading of the book, however,
seems to suggest no such thing. Acosta went
to the barrio of East Los Angeles to write and
observe, to tell the story behind the Chicano
unrest. Since he had talents no one else had —
a law degree and bar card — he was gradually
involved to a greater degree, achieving a sort
of unconscious solidarity with the movement.
Acosta broke off his frenzied involvement
to keep his sanity and perspective, that of a
soul "going in all directions, half-assed but
free," as he describes himself at the end of the
book.
That's also a good description of the style
of the book, as Acosta constantly switches
from the perspective of a bemused observer to
that of frenzied involvement — with women,
the law, politics and ultimately and most
seriously, the cockroach people themselves.
The East LA Thirteen, the St. Basil
Twenty-One and the Tooner Flats Seven were
all defended by Acosta with vigor and
vehemence, laying his body and reputation on
the line.
Of course, he was cited and jailed for

contempt several times. But privately he was
living a life that measured up to the wildest,
most contemptuous fantasy that any crazed
reactionary judge could dream up.
Groping teenyboppers under a blanket
during a sit-in, having lascivious thoughts
about a woman juror and then consumating
them after the trial, smoking dope, planning a
fire bombing . . . it's all there; told in an
engaging style by a Socratic loco, who has
found answers, but not to his ultimate
questions.
The radical craziness that permeated the
various political and protest movements of the
late 1960s now seems to be into putting on
paper what happened from the viewpoint of
anyone who was involved.
It would be misleading to call The Revolt
of the Cockroach People a Chicano
"Strawberry Statement," for the causes of the
unrest in the Chicano community are much
more specific and go much deeper than what
went on at Columbia in 1968.
Acosta's book may serve the same purpose
that "Strawberry Statement" did, though, by
letting people see the human side of a
revolutionary movement; that the struggle for
La Raza is unique, as unique as the wild and
wooly personality of Oscar Z. Acosta.

most contemptuous fantasy that any crazed
reactionary judge could dream up.
Groping teenyboppers under a blanket
during a sit-in, having lascivious thoughts
about a woman juror and then consumating
them after the trial, smoking dope, planning a
fire bombing . . . it's all there; told in an
engaging style by a Socratic loco, who has
found answers, but not to his ultimate
questions.
The radical craziness that permeated the
various political and protest movements of the
late 1960s now seems to be into putting on
paper what happened from the viewpoint of
anyone who was involved.
It would be misleading to call The Revolt
of the Cockroach People a Chicano
"Strawberry Statement," for the causes of the
unrest in the Chicano community are much
more specific and go much deeper than what
went on at Columbia in 1968.
Acosta's book may serve the same purpose
that "Strawberry Statement" did, though, by
letting people see the human side of a
revolutionary movement; that the struggle for
La Raza is unique, as unique as the wild and
wooly personality of Oscar Z. Acosta.
The Revolt of the Cockroach People
by Oscar Zeta Acosta
Straight Arrow Books
By GEORGE POWELL
This is not a science-fiction book, although
Oscar Z. Acosta's life has certainly had a
surreal quality about it. For those unfamiliar
with Acosta, he is also known as Dr. Gonzo,
Hunter Thompson's "Samoan" lawyer, who
was the bigger, if not better half of Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas.
Acosta has himself written another book
The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo,
which detailed the struggles of a Chicano lad
growing up in the San Joaquin Valley and
coming to grips with the world, various drugs,
religion, the law and sex, in no particular
order.
Cockroach People takes up where the last
book left off, in 1968, when Acosta
determined to go to Los Angeles and write the
story of the Mexican-Americans' struggle
against the establishment. Instead of writing,
Acosta ended up serving as the movement's
lawyer, arguing cases that meant as much to
Chicanos as the Chicago Seven trial did to
white middle class protesters.
Acosta also found time during all the
turmoil to run for sheriff of Los Angeles
County, finishing second in the 1970 primary
with nearly 500,000 votes.

But all the turmoil, trials and pressures of
being a radical lawyer took their toll, and
according to the book jacket blurb, Acosta
finally sacrifices his sanity for the cause of the
cockroach people.
A close reading of the book, however,
seems to suggest no such thing. Acosta went
to the barrio of East Los Angeles to write and
observe, to tell the story behind the Chicano
unrest. Since he had talents no one else had —
a law degree and bar card — he was gradually
involved to a greater degree, achieving a sort
of unconscious solidarity with the movement.
Acosta broke off his frenzied involvement
to keep his sanity and perspective, that of a
soul "going in all directions, half-assed but
free," as he describes himself at the end of the
book.
That's also a good description of the style
of the book, as Acosta constantly switches
from the perspective of a bemused observer to
that of frenzied involvement — with women,
the law, politics and ultimately and most
seriously, the cockroach people themselves.
The East LA Thirteen, the St. Basil
Twenty-One and the Tooner Flats Seven were
all defended by Acosta with vigor and
vehemence, laying his body and reputation on
the line.
Of course, he was cited and jailed for

contempt several times. But privately he was
living a life that measured up to the wildest,
most contemptuous fantasy that any crazed
reactionary judge could dream up.
