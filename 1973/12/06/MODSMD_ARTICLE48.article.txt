## Aman Ensemble Gives Varied Show 
### RUST EDDIE 
Drawing from fin-de-siecle everywhere, the
Aman Folk Ensemble danced to a capacity
crowd in Memorial Auditorium last Friday.
This aquarium of folklore represented the
dances of 10 countries, from Egypt to
Appalachia.
The name "Aman" is a reference to the
Eastern lands occupied by the Ottoman Turks
for six centuries. U.C.L.A. gave the present
company of 85 costumed dancers, singers and
musicans a foster home 11 years ago.
Compared with, for example, the
Krasnayarsk Dance Company of Siberia, the
Aman Folk Ensemble is like margarine next to
the high-priced spread. Performing traditional
music and dances of Eastern Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, the company operates
under the artistic direction of Leona Wood

and Anthony Shay.
Some 300 costumes representing only a
portion of a collection were used for the
concert. Each year, according to the program,
members of the ensemble travel to the various
areas covered by Aman's repertoire to visit
remote villages and festivals, exchange
information with professional groups, state
ensembles and museums and other
knowledgeable authorities. Authentic
costumes are purchased directly from villagers
or else donated to Aman by their national
government.
The same care goes into the music heard in
an Aman concert. The 18 musicians used
nearly 60 instruments during the
performance, ranging from accordian, violin
and clarinet to kanon, saz, gajda, the
instruments of a tamburica orchestra and a

Ghanaian drum ensemble.
In groups of 10 to 20, Aman gave 18 dance
sequences that, while enchanting, were
without drama. There is much fun here — or
at least here and there. But endless ring dances
become boring after several hours.
Perhaps prima ballerina assoluta, Natalia
Makarova, should ha\e the final word.

Discussing her profession recently, Makarova
stated, "Classical ballet has some limits; that
makes this art more interesting, more exciting.
Because if we don't have these limits it will
not be art, it will be mere folklore. To be free
within the limits of the kind of frame is more
difficult than in an unlimited situation, but it
is more stimulating. There is no 'deadwood.' "
