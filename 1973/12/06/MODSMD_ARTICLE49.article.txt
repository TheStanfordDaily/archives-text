Lennon's IN'ew Vietory
John Lennon: Mind Games
Apple SW 3414
Rebounding from a disastrous
album (Sometime in New York
City) and recording while battling
with U.S. Immigration officials in
the courts, John Lennon seems to
have pulled a smashing victory
from ignoble defeat with his latest
release, Mind Games.'
The album climbed to number
16 in Billboard's Top 200 albums
in its first week after release,
without the benefit of a top-40
single.
Recently, the title track has
cracked the "top-40 KFRC-KYA
syndrome" and received AM air
play on both Bay Area and Los
Angeles rock stations. Meanwhile,
cuts like "Bring on the Lucie
(Freda Peeple)," "Out the Blue"
and "Only People" have been
making the FM circuits here,
namely KSJO, KSAN and KSFX.
All this publicity and
popularity seem to indicate that
the public is willing to listen to
and buy John Lennon's music
again. It does not necessarily
mean that Mind Games is full of
great music, but that Lennon has
again written a few songs that are
musically and lyrically palatable.
Good, Not Outstanding
The album as a whole is
pleasantly surprising, generally
good. But there is nothing to
make this a truly outstanding
record, worthy of the ex-Beatle's
truly outstanding talent.
This album plays mind games
with its audiences — harkening it
back to John's previous successes.
Much of the album can be picked
up and transferred to some other
point in his musical career.
For example, the vocals are
reminiscent of the intense echo,
spaced out lead of "Instant
Karma." The echo gets out of
hand at times and eventually
becomes tiring, especially in the
slower ballads.
The lyrics stem from John's
long-standing hang ups with peace
and the brotherhood of man.
Apparently he still believes he can
convert the masses of the world to
his ideologies by preaching
through his music. In "Bring on
the Lucie:"
"Well you were caught with
your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow
your pill
As you slip and you slide down
the hill
On the blood of the people
you killed.
Stop the killing now.
Dot it do it do it do it do it
now."
Apologies to Yoko
Other parts of the album
apologize to Yoko, John's wife, as
in "I Know (I Know)," while
songs such as "You Are Here" and
"Out the Blue" are simply
Lennon's love poems to Yoko.
Musically, "Out the Blue" rates
highest on the album. It is clean
and bluesy, beautifully written
and performed. Ken Ascher's
piano solo fits the song perfectly
and is one of the few instrumental
solos on the album.
Lennon's soulful guitar in
"Aisumasen" is the only other
notable solo on the record.
The only real failures in Mind
Games are three tracks which
drag, instrumentally and lyrically.

"One Day (At a Time)," "I Know
(I Know)" and "You Are Here"
seem extremely mushy. But eight
good songs out of 11 is not a bad
average.
Musically Stronger
In contrast to Yoko Ono's
latest release, Feeling the Space
(see review below), the music in
Mind Games is a thousand-fold
improvement. This is odd since
the same musicians who played
rather meekly in Yoko's album
truly hold their own in John's.
Another oddity in Mind Games
is the three-second "Nutopian
National Anthem" at the end of
side one. Only three seconds???
The anthem, three seconds of
silence, proclaims the birth of a
conceptual community that has
no land, no boundaries, no
passports, only people — and all
the people of the nation are
ambassadors, according to the
album liner.
As an ambassador of the
cosmic conceptual community,
John Lennon seems to have
packaged his diplomatic strategies
in an album with some good
music. Finally John has come
down to earth with something
decent to offer the people again.
With the album doing so well, I
just wonder if making loads of
money is legal in Nutopia. . . .

Yoko Doesn't Make It
Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, and
Something Different:
Feeling the Space
Apple SW-3412
Yoko Ono's latest release
comes on like a hard-hitting,
determined women's lib record,
uplifting the downtrodden masses
of females from their bondage in
the "male society." Actually,
Feeling the Space isn't even strong
enough to support itself, much
less all of womankind, in the
cutthroat recording world.
Musically, Yoko and the 14
contributing musicians (all male)
play limp-wristedly. The songs are
not necessarily written poorly,
but sung and played feebly.
Yoko Ono's wobbling, at times
screeching soprano does not give
credibility to songs that come on
strong, with heavy messages, like
"Woman Power:"
"Woman power, woman power
Two thousand years of
male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Cling to values
vain and phony
Woman power, woman power."
Needless to say, Yoko does not
mince words. She is unflinchingly
straight-forward in her lyrics,
which seems incongruous with the
weak music.
Part, but not all, of the
problem with the album can be
traced to Yoko's lack of talent as
a vocalist. However, the producers
and arrangers deserve a good
whipping for releasing such a poor
musical product on the glutted
record scene.

Is He Crazy Or Not?
Loudon Wainwright III:
A ttempted Mustache
Columbia KC 32710
It is tempting to say that

Loudon Wainright 111 is crazy.
After all, who else would write a
song about a "dead skunk in the
middle of the road, stinkin' to
high heaven," or begin a lullaby
with the line "Shut up and go to
bed"? But the more I listen to his
new album, the more I am
convinced that the man is, to
borrow a phrase from playwright
Tom Stoppard, stark raving sane.
Wainwright has a true talent
for isolating and crystallizing bits
of human experience, normal and
otherwise. Some of the songs on
this album deal with simple things
like swimming holes, old friends
meeting again, and the like.
"Dilated to Meet You" is a sort of
song of welcome to an
about-to-be-born child.
Some of the other songs
satirize certain types of people,
sometimes gently, sometimes not.
In "Bell Bottom Pants," he tells
us "If you ain't got the pants you
ain't got a chance at the pop
festival, rock festival, folk festival
or the dance." "Liza" tells of
"pre-pubescent play" with Liza
Minelli, who is not specifically
named but clearly defined in the
song: "Now that you've got your
Oscar I don't think you'll be a
nurse." Neo-Christians will
probably be offended by "I Am
the Way," a song about
you-know-who set to a tune of
Woody Guthrie.
Wainwright also writes about
our darker side, however.
"Clockwork Cartreuse," with its
none-too-obvious title, deals with
the theme of violence in a way
that is somehow diabolically
funny.
A major part of the success of
these different types of songs is
due to Wainwright's voice. He
changes for every song in order to
exactly fit the lyrics, singing
anything from a sort of male
Melanie to easygoing folksinger
style to hard rock vocals.
Loudon Wainwright's sense of
humor obviously will not appeal
to everyone, but for those who
enjoyed his last effort, Album 111,
Attempted Mustache offers more
of the same. If nothing else, he
shows us logical extensions of
several of our more questionable
ways of thinking.

Derringer: Overdone
Rick Derringer:
All American Boy
Blue Sky KZ 32481

Rick Derringer, who has been a
part of all sorts of rock music in
the last ten years, has just released
his first album under his own
name. Unfortunately, his previous
credits are more impressive.
Derringer was the leader of the
top-40 McCoys during the
mid-60s, and played guitar and
sang with Johnny Winter from
1969 to 1971, when he joined
Edgar Winter's White Trash. He
began producing records with the
McCoys, later producing albums
by both Winters. His guitar work
appears on albums by Richie
Havens, Steely Dan, Todd
Rundgren, and Alice Cooper.
All American Boy represents
Derringer's effort to make it on
his own. All of the tunes are his
own, and mostly new. The
exception is "Rock and Roll
Hoochie Koo," which he wrote
and recorded with Johnny Winter;
this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this
album suffer from
over-production. The string
arrangements get in the way more
than they add to the album;
"Hold" and some moments in
other cuts sound more like Isaac
Hayes than what I would expect
from a rock and roll veteran like
Derringer. "Time Warp" has so
many overdubbed guitar tracks
that it sounds Hike an army of
Rick Derringer clones has just
invaded the room.
Another weak point is
Derringer's vocals. They are
competent, but not up to the
superstar image that he tries to
present on this album. His lyrics
contain nothing quote-worthy.
But the album is not without
its strengths. There are certainly
worse guitarists around than
Derringer. He has demonstrated
his talent and versatility on this
album and elsewhre, and certainly
seems to have the potential to put
out another album which better
shows off his abilities.

New Birth's Best Yet
New Birth:
It's Been A Long Time
RCA APLI-0285
New Birth, one of the finest
new black groups to hit the R&B
scene, has just released a new
album. It's Been A Long Time is
by far the best to date by New
Birth.

The album, featuring the
current radio, hit "Wild Flower,"
contains many songs suitable for
buggin' (dancing — for all you
non-hip listeners out there). New
Birth, often compared to Earth,
Wind and Fire, and to some
extent The Ohio Players, lends
itself a sense of distinction on this
album. In addition to the usual
funky, sometimes jumping,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
New Birth has contributed some
outstanding singing.
Especially notable on "I'll
Spend My Whole Life Loving
You," and "Come and Dream
Some Paradise" are excellent lead
vocals. The lead singer's voice
sounds very much like that of
Stevie Wonder during his earlier
("For Once In My Life," "My
Cherie Amour") period.
Also of note are the back-up
vocals. What sounds like three or
four young ladies does an
excellent job of harmonizing,
filling, and generally enhancing
the richness of the music. Their
perfect phrasing and intertwining
of gospel-like tones lends one to a
feeling of serenity and
contentment. Listen to "Heaven
Says" or the title cut, and you'll
see what I mean.
All in all It's Been A Long
Time is a good effort. Its selection
of fast songs for those who like to

trip the light fantastic, and
equally good slow numbers for
those who'd like a little more,
enjoyment out of dancing, should
send it to the top of the charts.

Cannonball Sampler
Cannonball Adderley
Cannonball Adderley and Friends
Capitol SUDB 11233
For almost 20 years, Julian
"Cannonball" Adderley has been
American's best-known alto sax
player, but he has never won more
than grudging compliments from
its jazz critics. Since he first
appeared in the early fifties, he
has been branded an imitator of
the late Charlie Parker's style and
a mere "popularizier" without
any sense of innovation. In this
year's prestigious Down Beat
critics' poll, for example,
Cannonball received only three
votes, about one-tenth as many as
the Alto winner.
Cannonball's latest album,
Cannonball Adderley and Friends,
is made up entirely of re-released
cuts from ten earlier discs, mostly
from his work in the early and
mid--60s. The record presents
Cannonball's immense talent in a
wide range of musical contexts
from blues to bossa nova to bop.

He emerges from the collection as
probably the best all-around alto
player in jazz today.
Two of the record's most
interesting cuts, "Never Will I
Marry" and Parker's "Au
Privave," feature the late guitar
great Wes Montgomery and
capable sidemen Victor Feldman
on vibes and piano and Ray
Brown on bass. All three have
extensive (and excellent) solos,
but Cannonball, very much in a
"Bird" mood, dominates both
tracks with unsurpassed
smoothness and lyricism.
Seven of the two-record set's
18 cuts show Cannonball as an
accompanist for several
outstanding jazz vocalists. For
sheer energy and excitement, Lou
Rawls' "I'd Rather Drink Muddy
Water" is the most fulfilling.
Backed by a ripping electric piano
and an enthusiastic live audience,
Rawls gives a great performance
and Cannonball proves he can
biow with the best.
The album's best cuts feature
Cannonball with pianist Wynton
Kelly, whome he once called "the
perfect accompanist." Cannonball
may not be an innovator, but
these two cuts prove he has more
than enough talent as a performer
to earn recognition as a great jazz
musician.

"One Day (At a Time)," "I Know
(I Know)" and "You Are Here"
seem extremely mushy. But eight
good songs out of 11 is not a bad
average.
Musically Stronger
In contrast to Yoko Ono's
latest release, Feeling the Space
(see review below), the music in
Mind Games is a thousand-fold
improvement. This is odd since
the same musicians who played
rather meekly in Yoko's album
truly hold their own in John's.
Another oddity in Mind Games
is the three-second "Nutopian
National Anthem" at the end of
side one. Only three seconds???
The anthem, three seconds of
silence, proclaims the birth of a
conceptual community that has
no land, no boundaries, no
passports, only people — and all
the people of the nation are
ambassadors, according to the
album liner.
As an ambassador of the
cosmic conceptual community,
John Lennon seems to have
packaged his diplomatic strategies
in an album with some good
music. Finally John has come
down to earth with something
decent to offer the people again.
With the album doing so well, I
just wonder if making loads of
money is legal in Nutopia. . . .

Yoko Doesn't Make It
Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, and
Something Different:
Feeling the Space
Apple SW-3412
Yoko Ono's latest release
comes on like a hard-hitting,
determined women's lib record,
uplifting the downtrodden masses
of females from their bondage in
the "male society." Actually,
Feeling the Space isn't even strong
enough to support itself, much
less all of womankind, in the
cutthroat recording world.
Musically, Yoko and the 14
contributing musicians (all male)
play limp-wristedly. The songs are
not necessarily written poorly,
but sung and played feebly.
Yoko Ono's wobbling, at times
screeching soprano does not give
credibility to songs that come on
strong, with heavy messages, like
"Woman Power:"
"Woman power, woman power
Two thousand years of
male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Cling to values
vain and phony
Woman power, woman power."
Needless to say, Yoko does not
mince words. She is unflinchingly
straight-forward in her lyrics,
which seems incongruous with the
weak music.
Part, but not all, of the
problem with the album can be
traced to Yoko's lack of talent as
a vocalist. However, the producers
and arrangers deserve a good
whipping for releasing such a poor
musical product on the glutted
record scene.

Is He Crazy Or Not?
Loudon Wainwright III:
A ttempted Mustache
Columbia KC 32710
It is tempting to say that

Loudon Wainright 111 is crazy.
After all, who else would write a
song about a "dead skunk in the
middle of the road, stinkin' to
high heaven," or begin a lullaby
with the line "Shut up and go to
bed"? But the more I listen to his
new album, the more I am
convinced that the man is, to
borrow a phrase from playwright
Tom Stoppard, stark raving sane.
Wainwright has a true talent
for isolating and crystallizing bits
of human experience, normal and
otherwise. Some of the songs on
this album deal with simple things
like swimming holes, old friends
meeting again, and the like.
"Dilated to Meet You" is a sort of
song of welcome to an
about-to-be-born child.
Some of the other songs
satirize certain types of people,
sometimes gently, sometimes not.
In "Bell Bottom Pants," he tells
us "If you ain't got the pants you
ain't got a chance at the pop
festival, rock festival, folk festival
or the dance." "Liza" tells of
"pre-pubescent play" with Liza
Minelli, who is not specifically
named but clearly defined in the
song: "Now that you've got your
Oscar I don't think you'll be a
nurse." Neo-Christians will
probably be offended by "I Am
the Way," a song about
you-know-who set to a tune of
Woody Guthrie.
Wainwright also writes about
our darker side, however.
"Clockwork Cartreuse," with its
none-too-obvious title, deals with
the theme of violence in a way
that is somehow diabolically
funny.
A major part of the success of
these different types of songs is
due to Wainwright's voice. He
changes for every song in order to
exactly fit the lyrics, singing
anything from a sort of male
Melanie to easygoing folksinger
style to hard rock vocals.
Loudon Wainwright's sense of
humor obviously will not appeal
to everyone, but for those who
enjoyed his last effort, Album 111,
Attempted Mustache offers more
of the same. If nothing else, he
shows us logical extensions of
several of our more questionable
ways of thinking.

Derringer: Overdone
Rick Derringer:
All American Boy
Blue Sky KZ 32481

Rick Derringer, who has been a
part of all sorts of rock music in
the last ten years, has just released
his first album under his own
name. Unfortunately, his previous
credits are more impressive.
Derringer was the leader of the
top-40 McCoys during the
mid-60s, and played guitar and
sang with Johnny Winter from
1969 to 1971, when he joined
Edgar Winter's White Trash. He
began producing records with the
McCoys, later producing albums
by both Winters. His guitar work
appears on albums by Richie
Havens, Steely Dan, Todd
Rundgren, and Alice Cooper.
All American Boy represents
Derringer's effort to make it on
his own. All of the tunes are his
own, and mostly new. The
exception is "Rock and Roll
Hoochie Koo," which he wrote
and recorded with Johnny Winter;
this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this
album suffer from
over-production. The string
arrangements get in the way more
than they add to the album;
"Hold" and some moments in
other cuts sound more like Isaac
Hayes than what I would expect
from a rock and roll veteran like
Derringer. "Time Warp" has so
many overdubbed guitar tracks
that it sounds Hike an army of
Rick Derringer clones has just
invaded the room.
Another weak point is
Derringer's vocals. They are
competent, but not up to the
superstar image that he tries to
present on this album. His lyrics
contain nothing quote-worthy.
But the album is not without
its strengths. There are certainly
worse guitarists around than
Derringer. He has demonstrated
his talent and versatility on this
album and elsewhre, and certainly
seems to have the potential to put
out another album which better
shows off his abilities.

New Birth's Best Yet
New Birth:
It's Been A Long Time
RCA APLI-0285
New Birth, one of the finest
new black groups to hit the R&B
scene, has just released a new
album. It's Been A Long Time is
by far the best to date by New
Birth.

The album, featuring the
current radio, hit "Wild Flower,"
contains many songs suitable for
buggin' (dancing — for all you
non-hip listeners out there). New
Birth, often compared to Earth,
Wind and Fire, and to some
extent The Ohio Players, lends
itself a sense of distinction on this
album. In addition to the usual
funky, sometimes jumping,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
New Birth has contributed some
outstanding singing.
Especially notable on "I'll
Spend My Whole Life Loving
You," and "Come and Dream
Some Paradise" are excellent lead
vocals. The lead singer's voice
sounds very much like that of
Stevie Wonder during his earlier
("For Once In My Life," "My
Cherie Amour") period.
Also of note are the back-up
vocals. What sounds like three or
four young ladies does an
excellent job of harmonizing,
filling, and generally enhancing
the richness of the music. Their
perfect phrasing and intertwining
of gospel-like tones lends one to a
feeling of serenity and
contentment. Listen to "Heaven
Says" or the title cut, and you'll
see what I mean.
All in all It's Been A Long
Time is a good effort. Its selection
of fast songs for those who like to

trip the light fantastic, and
equally good slow numbers for
those who'd like a little more,
enjoyment out of dancing, should
send it to the top of the charts.

Cannonball Sampler
Cannonball Adderley
Cannonball Adderley and Friends
Capitol SUDB 11233
For almost 20 years, Julian
"Cannonball" Adderley has been
American's best-known alto sax
player, but he has never won more
than grudging compliments from
its jazz critics. Since he first
appeared in the early fifties, he
has been branded an imitator of
the late Charlie Parker's style and
a mere "popularizier" without
any sense of innovation. In this
year's prestigious Down Beat
critics' poll, for example,
Cannonball received only three
votes, about one-tenth as many as
the Alto winner.
Cannonball's latest album,
Cannonball Adderley and Friends,
is made up entirely of re-released
cuts from ten earlier discs, mostly
from his work in the early and
mid--60s. The record presents
Cannonball's immense talent in a
wide range of musical contexts
from blues to bossa nova to bop.

He emerges from the collection as
probably the best all-around alto
player in jazz today.
Two of the record's most
interesting cuts, "Never Will I
Marry" and Parker's "Au
Privave," feature the late guitar
great Wes Montgomery and
capable sidemen Victor Feldman
on vibes and piano and Ray
Brown on bass. All three have
extensive (and excellent) solos,
but Cannonball, very much in a
"Bird" mood, dominates both
tracks with unsurpassed
smoothness and lyricism.
Seven of the two-record set's
18 cuts show Cannonball as an
accompanist for several
outstanding jazz vocalists. For
sheer energy and excitement, Lou
Rawls' "I'd Rather Drink Muddy
Water" is the most fulfilling.
Backed by a ripping electric piano
and an enthusiastic live audience,
Rawls gives a great performance
and Cannonball proves he can
biow with the best.
The album's best cuts feature
Cannonball with pianist Wynton
Kelly, whome he once called "the
perfect accompanist." Cannonball
may not be an innovator, but
these two cuts prove he has more
than enough talent as a performer
to earn recognition as a great jazz
musician.

Lennon's IN'ew Vietory
John Lennon: Mind Games
Apple SW 3414
Rebounding from a disastrous
album (Sometime in New York
City) and recording while battling
with U.S. Immigration officials in
the courts, John Lennon seems to
have pulled a smashing victory
from ignoble defeat with his latest
release, Mind Games.'
The album climbed to number
16 in Billboard's Top 200 albums
in its first week after release,
without the benefit of a top-40
single.
Recently, the title track has
cracked the "top-40 KFRC-KYA
syndrome" and received AM air
play on both Bay Area and Los
Angeles rock stations. Meanwhile,
cuts like "Bring on the Lucie
(Freda Peeple)," "Out the Blue"
and "Only People" have been
making the FM circuits here,
namely KSJO, KSAN and KSFX.
All this publicity and
popularity seem to indicate that
the public is willing to listen to
and buy John Lennon's music
again. It does not necessarily
mean that Mind Games is full of
great music, but that Lennon has
again written a few songs that are
musically and lyrically palatable.
Good, Not Outstanding
The album as a whole is
pleasantly surprising, generally
good. But there is nothing to
make this a truly outstanding
record, worthy of the ex-Beatle's
truly outstanding talent.
This album plays mind games
with its audiences — harkening it
back to John's previous successes.
Much of the album can be picked
up and transferred to some other
point in his musical career.
For example, the vocals are
reminiscent of the intense echo,
spaced out lead of "Instant
Karma." The echo gets out of
hand at times and eventually
becomes tiring, especially in the
slower ballads.
The lyrics stem from John's
long-standing hang ups with peace
and the brotherhood of man.
Apparently he still believes he can
convert the masses of the world to
his ideologies by preaching
through his music. In "Bring on
the Lucie:"
"Well you were caught with
your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow
your pill
As you slip and you slide down
the hill
On the blood of the people
you killed.
Stop the killing now.
Dot it do it do it do it do it
now."
Apologies to Yoko
Other parts of the album
apologize to Yoko, John's wife, as
in "I Know (I Know)," while
songs such as "You Are Here" and
"Out the Blue" are simply
Lennon's love poems to Yoko.
Musically, "Out the Blue" rates
highest on the album. It is clean
and bluesy, beautifully written
and performed. Ken Ascher's
piano solo fits the song perfectly
and is one of the few instrumental
solos on the album.
Lennon's soulful guitar in
"Aisumasen" is the only other
notable solo on the record.
The only real failures in Mind
Games are three tracks which
drag, instrumentally and lyrically.

"One Day (At a Time)," "I Know
(I Know)" and "You Are Here"
seem extremely mushy. But eight
good songs out of 11 is not a bad

with the line "Shut up and go to
bed"? But the more I listen to his
new album, the more I am
convinced that the man is, to
borrow a phrase from playwright
Tom Stoppard, stark raving sane.
Wainwright has a true talent
for isolating and crystallizing bits
of human experience, normal and
otherwise. Some of the songs on
this album deal with simple things
like swimming holes, old friends
meeting again, and the like.
"Dilated to Meet You" is a sort of
song of welcome to an
about-to-be-born child.
Some of the other songs
satirize certain types of people,
sometimes gently, sometimes not.
In "Bell Bottom Pants," he tells
us "If you ain't got the pants you
ain't got a chance at the pop
festival, rock festival, folk festival
or the dance." "Liza" tells of
"pre-pubescent play" with Liza
Minelli, who is not specifically
named but clearly defined in the
song: "Now that you've got your
Oscar I don't think you'll be a
nurse." Neo-Christians will
probably be offended by "I Am
the Way," a song about
you-know-who set to a tune of
Woody Guthrie.
Wainwright also writes about
our darker side, however.
"Clockwork Cartreuse," with its
none-too-obvious title, deals with
the theme of violence in a way
that is somehow diabolically
funny.
A major part of the success of
these different types of songs is
due to Wainwright's voice. He
changes for every song in order to
exactly fit the lyrics, singing
anything from a sort of male
Melanie to easygoing folksinger
style to hard rock vocals.
Loudon Wainwright's sense of
humor obviously will not appeal
to everyone, but for those who
enjoyed his last effort, Album 111,
Attempted Mustache offers more
of the same. If nothing else, he
shows us logical extensions of
several of our more questionable
ways of thinking.

Derringer: Overdone
Rick Derringer:
All American Boy
Blue Sky KZ 32481

Rick Derringer, who has been a
part of all sorts of rock music in
the last ten years, has just released
his first album under his own
name. Unfortunately, his previous
credits are more impressive.
Derringer was the leader of the
top-40 McCoys during the
mid-60s, and played guitar and
sang with Johnny Winter from
1969 to 1971, when he joined
Edgar Winter's White Trash. He
began producing records with the
McCoys, later producing albums
by both Winters. His guitar work
appears on albums by Richie
Havens, Steely Dan, Todd
Rundgren, and Alice Cooper.
All American Boy represents
Derringer's effort to make it on
his own. All of the tunes are his
own, and mostly new. The
exception is "Rock and Roll
Hoochie Koo," which he wrote
and recorded with Johnny Winter;
this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this
album suffer from
over-production. The string
arrangements get in the way more
than they add to the album;
"Hold" and some moments in
other cuts sound more like Isaac
Hayes than what I would expect
from a rock and roll veteran like
Derringer. "Time Warp" has so
many overdubbed guitar tracks
that it sounds Hike an army of
Rick Derringer clones has just
invaded the room.
Another weak point is
Derringer's vocals. They are
competent, but not up to the
superstar image that he tries to
present on this album. His lyrics
contain nothing quote-worthy.
But the album is not without
its strengths. There are certainly
worse guitarists around than
Derringer. He has demonstrated
his talent and versatility on this
album and elsewhre, and certainly
seems to have the potential to put
out another album which better
shows off his abilities.

New Birth's Best Yet
New Birth:
It's Been A Long Time
RCA APLI-0285
New Birth, one of the finest
new black groups to hit the R&B
scene, has just released a new
album. It's Been A Long Time is
by far the best to date by New
Birth.

The album, featuring the
current radio, hit "Wild Flower,"
contains many songs suitable for
buggin' (dancing — for all you
non-hip listeners out there). New
Birth, often compared to Earth,
Wind and Fire, and to some
extent The Ohio Players, lends
itself a sense of distinction on this
album. In addition to the usual
funky, sometimes jumping,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
New Birth has contributed some
outstanding singing.
Especially notable on "I'll
Spend My Whole Life Loving
You," and "Come and Dream
Some Paradise" are excellent lead
vocals. The lead singer's voice
sounds very much like that of
Stevie Wonder during his earlier
("For Once In My Life," "My
Cherie Amour") period.
Also of note are the back-up
vocals. What sounds like three or
four young ladies does an
excellent job of harmonizing,
filling, and generally enhancing
the richness of the music. Their
perfect phrasing and intertwining
of gospel-like tones lends one to a
feeling of serenity and
contentment. Listen to "Heaven
Says" or the title cut, and you'll
see what I mean.
All in all It's Been A Long
Time is a good effort. Its selection
of fast songs for those who like to

trip the light fantastic, and
equally good slow numbers for
those who'd like a little more,
enjoyment out of dancing, should
send it to the top of the charts.

Cannonball Sampler
Cannonball Adderley
Cannonball Adderley and Friends
Capitol SUDB 11233
For almost 20 years, Julian
"Cannonball" Adderley has been
American's best-known alto sax
player, but he has never won more
than grudging compliments from
its jazz critics. Since he first
appeared in the early fifties, he
has been branded an imitator of
the late Charlie Parker's style and
a mere "popularizier" without
any sense of innovation. In this
year's prestigious Down Beat
critics' poll, for example,
Cannonball received only three
votes, about one-tenth as many as
the Alto winner.
Cannonball's latest album,
Cannonball Adderley and Friends,
is made up entirely of re-released
cuts from ten earlier discs, mostly
from his work in the early and
mid--60s. The record presents
Cannonball's immense talent in a
wide range of musical contexts
from blues to bossa nova to bop.

He emerges from the collection as
probably the best all-around alto
player in jazz today.
Two of the record's most
interesting cuts, "Never Will I
Marry" and Parker's "Au
Privave," feature the late guitar
great Wes Montgomery and
capable sidemen Victor Feldman
on vibes and piano and Ray
Brown on bass. All three have
extensive (and excellent) solos,
but Cannonball, very much in a
"Bird" mood, dominates both
tracks with unsurpassed
smoothness and lyricism.
Seven of the two-record set's
18 cuts show Cannonball as an
accompanist for several
outstanding jazz vocalists. For
sheer energy and excitement, Lou
Rawls' "I'd Rather Drink Muddy
Water" is the most fulfilling.
Backed by a ripping electric piano
and an enthusiastic live audience,
Rawls gives a great performance
and Cannonball proves he can
biow with the best.
The album's best cuts feature
Cannonball with pianist Wynton
Kelly, whome he once called "the
perfect accompanist." Cannonball
may not be an innovator, but
these two cuts prove he has more
than enough talent as a performer
to earn recognition as a great jazz
musician.

Lennon's IN'ew Vietory
John Lennon: Mind Games
Apple SW 3414
Rebounding from a disastrous
album (Sometime in New York
City) and recording while battling
with U.S. Immigration officials in
the courts, John Lennon seems to
have pulled a smashing victory
from ignoble defeat with his latest
release, Mind Games.'
The album climbed to number
16 in Billboard's Top 200 albums
in its first week after release,
without the benefit of a top-40
single.
Recently, the title track has
cracked the "top-40 KFRC-KYA
syndrome" and received AM air
play on both Bay Area and Los
Angeles rock stations. Meanwhile,
cuts like "Bring on the Lucie
(Freda Peeple)," "Out the Blue"
and "Only People" have been
making the FM circuits here,
namely KSJO, KSAN and KSFX.
All this publicity and
popularity seem to indicate that
the public is willing to listen to
and buy John Lennon's music
again. It does not necessarily
mean that Mind Games is full of
great music, but that Lennon has
again written a few songs that are
musically and lyrically palatable.
Good, Not Outstanding
The album as a whole is
pleasantly surprising, generally
good. But there is nothing to
make this a truly outstanding
record, worthy of the ex-Beatle's
truly outstanding talent.
This album plays mind games
with its audiences — harkening it
back to John's previous successes.
Much of the album can be picked
up and transferred to some other
point in his musical career.
For example, the vocals are
reminiscent of the intense echo,
spaced out lead of "Instant
Karma." The echo gets out of
hand at times and eventually
becomes tiring, especially in the
slower ballads.
The lyrics stem from John's
long-standing hang ups with peace
and the brotherhood of man.
Apparently he still believes he can
convert the masses of the world to
his ideologies by preaching
through his music. In "Bring on
the Lucie:"
"Well you were caught with
your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow
your pill
As you slip and you slide down
the hill
On the blood of the people
you killed.
Stop the killing now.
Dot it do it do it do it do it
now."
Apologies to Yoko
Other parts of the album
apologize to Yoko, John's wife, as
in "I Know (I Know)," while
songs such as "You Are Here" and
"Out the Blue" are simply
Lennon's love poems to Yoko.
Musically, "Out the Blue" rates
highest on the album. It is clean
and bluesy, beautifully written
and performed. Ken Ascher's
piano solo fits the song perfectly
and is one of the few instrumental
solos on the album.
Lennon's soulful guitar in
"Aisumasen" is the only other
notable solo on the record.
The only real failures in Mind
Games are three tracks which
drag, instrumentally and lyrically.

"One Day (At a Time)," "I Know
(I Know)" and "You Are Here"
seem extremely mushy. But eight
good songs out of 11 is not a bad
average.
Musically Stronger
In contrast to Yoko Ono's
latest release, Feeling the Space
(see review below), the music in
Mind Games is a thousand-fold
improvement. This is odd since
the same musicians who played
rather meekly in Yoko's album
truly hold their own in John's.
Another oddity in Mind Games
is the three-second "Nutopian
National Anthem" at the end of
side one. Only three seconds???
The anthem, three seconds of
silence, proclaims the birth of a
conceptual community that has
no land, no boundaries, no
passports, only people — and all
the people of the nation are
ambassadors, according to the
album liner.
As an ambassador of the
cosmic conceptual community,
John Lennon seems to have
packaged his diplomatic strategies
in an album with some good
music. Finally John has come
down to earth with something
decent to offer the people again.
With the album doing so well, I
just wonder if making loads of
money is legal in Nutopia. . . .
—Mark Simonian
Yoko Doesn't Make It
Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, and
Something Different:
Feeling the Space
Apple SW-3412
Yoko Ono's latest release
comes on like a hard-hitting,
determined women's lib record,
uplifting the downtrodden masses
of females from their bondage in
the "male society." Actually,
Feeling the Space isn't even strong
enough to support itself, much
less all of womankind, in the
cutthroat recording world.
Musically, Yoko and the 14
contributing musicians (all male)
play limp-wristedly. The songs are
not necessarily written poorly,
but sung and played feebly.
Yoko Ono's wobbling, at times
screeching soprano does not give
credibility to songs that come on
strong, with heavy messages, like
"Woman Power:"
"Woman power, woman power
Two thousand years of
male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Cling to values
vain and phony
Woman power, woman power."
Needless to say, Yoko does not
mince words. She is unflinchingly
straight-forward in her lyrics,
which seems incongruous with the
weak music.
Part, but not all, of the
problem with the album can be
traced to Yoko's lack of talent as
a vocalist. However, the producers
and arrangers deserve a good
whipping for releasing such a poor
musical product on the glutted
record scene.

It is tempting to say that

Loudon Wainright 111 is crazy.
After all, who else would write a

this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this
album suffer from
over-production. The string
arrangements get in the way more
than they add to the album;
"Hold" and some moments in
other cuts sound more like Isaac
Hayes than what I would expect
from a rock and roll veteran like
Derringer. "Time Warp" has so
many overdubbed guitar tracks
that it sounds Hike an army of
Rick Derringer clones has just
invaded the room.
Another weak point is
Derringer's vocals. They are
competent, but not up to the
superstar image that he tries to
present on this album. His lyrics
contain nothing quote-worthy.
But the album is not without
its strengths. There are certainly
worse guitarists around than
Derringer. He has demonstrated
his talent and versatility on this
album and elsewhre, and certainly
seems to have the potential to put
out another album which better
shows off his abilities.

New Birth's Best Yet
New Birth:
It's Been A Long Time
RCA APLI-0285
New Birth, one of the finest
new black groups to hit the R&B
scene, has just released a new
album. It's Been A Long Time is
by far the best to date by New
Birth.

The album, featuring the
current radio, hit "Wild Flower,"
contains many songs suitable for
buggin' (dancing — for all you
non-hip listeners out there). New
Birth, often compared to Earth,
Wind and Fire, and to some
extent The Ohio Players, lends
itself a sense of distinction on this
album. In addition to the usual
funky, sometimes jumping,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
New Birth has contributed some
outstanding singing.
Especially notable on "I'll
Spend My Whole Life Loving
You," and "Come and Dream
Some Paradise" are excellent lead
vocals. The lead singer's voice
sounds very much like that of
Stevie Wonder during his earlier
("For Once In My Life," "My
Cherie Amour") period.
Also of note are the back-up
vocals. What sounds like three or
four young ladies does an
excellent job of harmonizing,
filling, and generally enhancing
the richness of the music. Their
perfect phrasing and intertwining
of gospel-like tones lends one to a
feeling of serenity and
contentment. Listen to "Heaven
Says" or the title cut, and you'll
see what I mean.
All in all It's Been A Long
Time is a good effort. Its selection
of fast songs for those who like to

trip the light fantastic, and
equally good slow numbers for
those who'd like a little more,
enjoyment out of dancing, should
send it to the top of the charts.

Cannonball Sampler
Cannonball Adderley
Cannonball Adderley and Friends
Capitol SUDB 11233
For almost 20 years, Julian
"Cannonball" Adderley has been
American's best-known alto sax
player, but he has never won more
than grudging compliments from
its jazz critics. Since he first
appeared in the early fifties, he
has been branded an imitator of
the late Charlie Parker's style and
a mere "popularizier" without
any sense of innovation. In this
year's prestigious Down Beat
critics' poll, for example,
Cannonball received only three
votes, about one-tenth as many as
the Alto winner.
Cannonball's latest album,
Cannonball Adderley and Friends,
is made up entirely of re-released
cuts from ten earlier discs, mostly
from his work in the early and
mid--60s. The record presents
Cannonball's immense talent in a
wide range of musical contexts
from blues to bossa nova to bop.

He emerges from the collection as
probably the best all-around alto
player in jazz today.
Two of the record's most
interesting cuts, "Never Will I
Marry" and Parker's "Au
Privave," feature the late guitar
great Wes Montgomery and
capable sidemen Victor Feldman
on vibes and piano and Ray
Brown on bass. All three have
extensive (and excellent) solos,
but Cannonball, very much in a
"Bird" mood, dominates both
tracks with unsurpassed
smoothness and lyricism.
Seven of the two-record set's
18 cuts show Cannonball as an
accompanist for several
outstanding jazz vocalists. For
sheer energy and excitement, Lou
Rawls' "I'd Rather Drink Muddy
Water" is the most fulfilling.
Backed by a ripping electric piano
and an enthusiastic live audience,
Rawls gives a great performance
and Cannonball proves he can
biow with the best.
The album's best cuts feature
Cannonball with pianist Wynton
Kelly, whome he once called "the
perfect accompanist." Cannonball
may not be an innovator, but
these two cuts prove he has more
than enough talent as a performer
to earn recognition as a great jazz
musician.

Lennon's IN'ew Vietory
John Lennon: Mind Games
Apple SW 3414
Rebounding from a disastrous
album (Sometime in New York
City) and recording while battling
with U.S. Immigration officials in
the courts, John Lennon seems to
have pulled a smashing victory
from ignoble defeat with his latest
release, Mind Games.'
The album climbed to number
16 in Billboard's Top 200 albums
in its first week after release,
without the benefit of a top-40
single.
Recently, the title track has
cracked the "top-40 KFRC-KYA
syndrome" and received AM air
play on both Bay Area and Los
Angeles rock stations. Meanwhile,
cuts like "Bring on the Lucie
(Freda Peeple)," "Out the Blue"
and "Only People" have been
making the FM circuits here,
namely KSJO, KSAN and KSFX.
All this publicity and
popularity seem to indicate that
the public is willing to listen to
and buy John Lennon's music
again. It does not necessarily
mean that Mind Games is full of
great music, but that Lennon has
again written a few songs that are
musically and lyrically palatable.
Good, Not Outstanding
The album as a whole is
pleasantly surprising, generally
good. But there is nothing to
make this a truly outstanding
record, worthy of the ex-Beatle's
truly outstanding talent.
This album plays mind games
with its audiences — harkening it
back to John's previous successes.
Much of the album can be picked
up and transferred to some other
point in his musical career.
For example, the vocals are
reminiscent of the intense echo,
spaced out lead of "Instant
Karma." The echo gets out of
hand at times and eventually
becomes tiring, especially in the
slower ballads.
The lyrics stem from John's
long-standing hang ups with peace
and the brotherhood of man.
Apparently he still believes he can
convert the masses of the world to
his ideologies by preaching
through his music. In "Bring on
the Lucie:"
"Well you were caught with
your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow
your pill
As you slip and you slide down
the hill
On the blood of the people
you killed.
Stop the killing now.
Dot it do it do it do it do it
now."
Apologies to Yoko
Other parts of the album
apologize to Yoko, John's wife, as
in "I Know (I Know)," while
songs such as "You Are Here" and
"Out the Blue" are simply
Lennon's love poems to Yoko.
Musically, "Out the Blue" rates
highest on the album. It is clean
and bluesy, beautifully written
and performed. Ken Ascher's
piano solo fits the song perfectly
and is one of the few instrumental
solos on the album.
Lennon's soulful guitar in
"Aisumasen" is the only other
notable solo on the record.
The only real failures in Mind
Games are three tracks which
drag, instrumentally and lyrically.

"One Day (At a Time)," "I Know
(I Know)" and "You Are Here"
seem extremely mushy. But eight
good songs out of 11 is not a bad
average.
Musically Stronger
In contrast to Yoko Ono's
latest release, Feeling the Space
(see review below), the music in
Mind Games is a thousand-fold
improvement. This is odd since
the same musicians who played
rather meekly in Yoko's album
truly hold their own in John's.
Another oddity in Mind Games
is the three-second "Nutopian
National Anthem" at the end of
side one. Only three seconds???
The anthem, three seconds of
silence, proclaims the birth of a
conceptual community that has
no land, no boundaries, no
passports, only people — and all
the people of the nation are
ambassadors, according to the
album liner.
As an ambassador of the
cosmic conceptual community,
John Lennon seems to have
packaged his diplomatic strategies
in an album with some good
music. Finally John has come
down to earth with something
decent to offer the people again.
With the album doing so well, I
just wonder if making loads of
money is legal in Nutopia. . . .
—Mark Simonian
Yoko Doesn't Make It
Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, and
Something Different:
Feeling the Space
Apple SW-3412
Yoko Ono's latest release
comes on like a hard-hitting,
determined women's lib record,
uplifting the downtrodden masses
of females from their bondage in
the "male society." Actually,
Feeling the Space isn't even strong
enough to support itself, much
less all of womankind, in the
cutthroat recording world.
Musically, Yoko and the 14
contributing musicians (all male)
play limp-wristedly. The songs are
not necessarily written poorly,
but sung and played feebly.
Yoko Ono's wobbling, at times
screeching soprano does not give
credibility to songs that come on
strong, with heavy messages, like
"Woman Power:"
"Woman power, woman power
Two thousand years of
male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Cling to values
vain and phony
Woman power, woman power."
Needless to say, Yoko does not
mince words. She is unflinchingly
straight-forward in her lyrics,
which seems incongruous with the
weak music.
Part, but not all, of the
problem with the album can be
traced to Yoko's lack of talent as
a vocalist. However, the producers
and arrangers deserve a good
whipping for releasing such a poor
musical product on the glutted
record scene.

Is He Crazy Or Not?
Loudon Wainwright III:
A ttempted Mustache
Columbia KC 32710
It is tempting to say that

Loudon Wainright 111 is crazy.
After all, who else would write a
song about a "dead skunk in the
middle of the road, stinkin' to
high heaven," or begin a lullaby
with the line "Shut up and go to
bed"? But the more I listen to his
new album, the more I am
convinced that the man is, to
borrow a phrase from playwright
Tom Stoppard, stark raving sane.
Wainwright has a true talent
for isolating and crystallizing bits
of human experience, normal and
otherwise. Some of the songs on
this album deal with simple things
like swimming holes, old friends
meeting again, and the like.
"Dilated to Meet You" is a sort of
song of welcome to an
about-to-be-born child.
Some of the other songs
satirize certain types of people,
sometimes gently, sometimes not.
In "Bell Bottom Pants," he tells
us "If you ain't got the pants you
ain't got a chance at the pop
festival, rock festival, folk festival
or the dance." "Liza" tells of
"pre-pubescent play" with Liza
Minelli, who is not specifically
named but clearly defined in the
song: "Now that you've got your
Oscar I don't think you'll be a
nurse." Neo-Christians will
probably be offended by "I Am
the Way," a song about
you-know-who set to a tune of
Woody Guthrie.
Wainwright also writes about
our darker side, however.
"Clockwork Cartreuse," with its
none-too-obvious title, deals with
the theme of violence in a way
that is somehow diabolically
funny.
A major part of the success of
these different types of songs is
due to Wainwright's voice. He
changes for every song in order to
exactly fit the lyrics, singing
anything from a sort of male
Melanie to easygoing folksinger
style to hard rock vocals.
Loudon Wainwright's sense of
humor obviously will not appeal
to everyone, but for those who
enjoyed his last effort, Album 111,
Attempted Mustache offers more
of the same. If nothing else, he
shows us logical extensions of
several of our more questionable
ways of thinking.

Derringer: Overdone
Rick Derringer:
All American Boy
Blue Sky KZ 32481

Rick Derringer, who has been a
part of all sorts of rock music in
the last ten years, has just released
his first album under his own
name. Unfortunately, his previous
credits are more impressive.
Derringer was the leader of the
top-40 McCoys during the
mid-60s, and played guitar and
sang with Johnny Winter from
1969 to 1971, when he joined
Edgar Winter's White Trash. He
began producing records with the
McCoys, later producing albums
by both Winters. His guitar work
appears on albums by Richie
Havens, Steely Dan, Todd
Rundgren, and Alice Cooper.
All American Boy represents
Derringer's effort to make it on
his own. All of the tunes are his
own, and mostly new. The
exception is "Rock and Roll
Hoochie Koo," which he wrote
and recorded with Johnny Winter;
this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this

player, but he has never won more
than grudging compliments from
its jazz critics. Since he first
appeared in the early fifties, he
has been branded an imitator of
the late Charlie Parker's style and
a mere "popularizier" without
any sense of innovation. In this
year's prestigious Down Beat
critics' poll, for example,
Cannonball received only three
votes, about one-tenth as many as
the Alto winner.
Cannonball's latest album,
Cannonball Adderley and Friends,
is made up entirely of re-released
cuts from ten earlier discs, mostly
from his work in the early and
mid--60s. The record presents
Cannonball's immense talent in a
wide range of musical contexts
from blues to bossa nova to bop.

He emerges from the collection as
probably the best all-around alto
player in jazz today.
Two of the record's most
interesting cuts, "Never Will I
Marry" and Parker's "Au
Privave," feature the late guitar
great Wes Montgomery and
capable sidemen Victor Feldman
on vibes and piano and Ray
Brown on bass. All three have
extensive (and excellent) solos,
but Cannonball, very much in a
"Bird" mood, dominates both
tracks with unsurpassed
smoothness and lyricism.
Seven of the two-record set's
18 cuts show Cannonball as an
accompanist for several
outstanding jazz vocalists. For
sheer energy and excitement, Lou
Rawls' "I'd Rather Drink Muddy
Water" is the most fulfilling.
Backed by a ripping electric piano
and an enthusiastic live audience,
Rawls gives a great performance
and Cannonball proves he can
biow with the best.
The album's best cuts feature
Cannonball with pianist Wynton
Kelly, whome he once called "the
perfect accompanist." Cannonball
may not be an innovator, but
these two cuts prove he has more
than enough talent as a performer
to earn recognition as a great jazz
musician.

Lennon's IN'ew Vietory
John Lennon: Mind Games
Apple SW 3414
Rebounding from a disastrous
album (Sometime in New York
City) and recording while battling
with U.S. Immigration officials in
the courts, John Lennon seems to
have pulled a smashing victory
from ignoble defeat with his latest
release, Mind Games.'
The album climbed to number
16 in Billboard's Top 200 albums
in its first week after release,
without the benefit of a top-40
single.
Recently, the title track has
cracked the "top-40 KFRC-KYA
syndrome" and received AM air
play on both Bay Area and Los
Angeles rock stations. Meanwhile,
cuts like "Bring on the Lucie
(Freda Peeple)," "Out the Blue"
and "Only People" have been
making the FM circuits here,
namely KSJO, KSAN and KSFX.
All this publicity and
popularity seem to indicate that
the public is willing to listen to
and buy John Lennon's music
again. It does not necessarily
mean that Mind Games is full of
great music, but that Lennon has
again written a few songs that are
musically and lyrically palatable.
Good, Not Outstanding
The album as a whole is
pleasantly surprising, generally
good. But there is nothing to
make this a truly outstanding
record, worthy of the ex-Beatle's
truly outstanding talent.
This album plays mind games
with its audiences — harkening it
back to John's previous successes.
Much of the album can be picked
up and transferred to some other
point in his musical career.
For example, the vocals are
reminiscent of the intense echo,
spaced out lead of "Instant
Karma." The echo gets out of
hand at times and eventually
becomes tiring, especially in the
slower ballads.
The lyrics stem from John's
long-standing hang ups with peace
and the brotherhood of man.
Apparently he still believes he can
convert the masses of the world to
his ideologies by preaching
through his music. In "Bring on
the Lucie:"
"Well you were caught with
your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow
your pill
As you slip and you slide down
the hill
On the blood of the people
you killed.
Stop the killing now.
Dot it do it do it do it do it
now."
Apologies to Yoko
Other parts of the album
apologize to Yoko, John's wife, as
in "I Know (I Know)," while
songs such as "You Are Here" and
"Out the Blue" are simply
Lennon's love poems to Yoko.
Musically, "Out the Blue" rates
highest on the album. It is clean
and bluesy, beautifully written
and performed. Ken Ascher's
piano solo fits the song perfectly
and is one of the few instrumental
solos on the album.
Lennon's soulful guitar in
"Aisumasen" is the only other
notable solo on the record.
The only real failures in Mind
Games are three tracks which
drag, instrumentally and lyrically.

"One Day (At a Time)," "I Know
(I Know)" and "You Are Here"
seem extremely mushy. But eight
good songs out of 11 is not a bad
average.
Musically Stronger
In contrast to Yoko Ono's
latest release, Feeling the Space
(see review below), the music in
Mind Games is a thousand-fold
improvement. This is odd since
the same musicians who played
rather meekly in Yoko's album
truly hold their own in John's.
Another oddity in Mind Games
is the three-second "Nutopian
National Anthem" at the end of
side one. Only three seconds???
The anthem, three seconds of
silence, proclaims the birth of a
conceptual community that has
no land, no boundaries, no
passports, only people — and all
the people of the nation are
ambassadors, according to the
album liner.
As an ambassador of the
cosmic conceptual community,
John Lennon seems to have
packaged his diplomatic strategies
in an album with some good
music. Finally John has come
down to earth with something
decent to offer the people again.
With the album doing so well, I
just wonder if making loads of
money is legal in Nutopia. . . .

Yoko Doesn't Make It
Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, and
Something Different:
Feeling the Space
Apple SW-3412
Yoko Ono's latest release
comes on like a hard-hitting,
determined women's lib record,
uplifting the downtrodden masses
of females from their bondage in
the "male society." Actually,
Feeling the Space isn't even strong
enough to support itself, much
less all of womankind, in the
cutthroat recording world.
Musically, Yoko and the 14
contributing musicians (all male)
play limp-wristedly. The songs are
not necessarily written poorly,
but sung and played feebly.
Yoko Ono's wobbling, at times
screeching soprano does not give
credibility to songs that come on
strong, with heavy messages, like
"Woman Power:"
"Woman power, woman power
Two thousand years of
male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Cling to values
vain and phony
Woman power, woman power."
Needless to say, Yoko does not
mince words. She is unflinchingly
straight-forward in her lyrics,
which seems incongruous with the
weak music.
Part, but not all, of the
problem with the album can be
traced to Yoko's lack of talent as
a vocalist. However, the producers
and arrangers deserve a good
whipping for releasing such a poor
musical product on the glutted
record scene.

Is He Crazy Or Not?
Loudon Wainwright III:
A ttempted Mustache
Columbia KC 32710
It is tempting to say that

Loudon Wainright 111 is crazy.
After all, who else would write a
song about a "dead skunk in the
middle of the road, stinkin' to
high heaven," or begin a lullaby
with the line "Shut up and go to
bed"? But the more I listen to his
new album, the more I am
convinced that the man is, to
borrow a phrase from playwright
Tom Stoppard, stark raving sane.
Wainwright has a true talent
for isolating and crystallizing bits
of human experience, normal and
otherwise. Some of the songs on
this album deal with simple things
like swimming holes, old friends
meeting again, and the like.
"Dilated to Meet You" is a sort of
song of welcome to an
about-to-be-born child.
Some of the other songs
satirize certain types of people,
sometimes gently, sometimes not.
In "Bell Bottom Pants," he tells
us "If you ain't got the pants you
ain't got a chance at the pop
festival, rock festival, folk festival
or the dance." "Liza" tells of
"pre-pubescent play" with Liza
Minelli, who is not specifically
named but clearly defined in the
song: "Now that you've got your
Oscar I don't think you'll be a
nurse." Neo-Christians will
probably be offended by "I Am
the Way," a song about
you-know-who set to a tune of
Woody Guthrie.
Wainwright also writes about
our darker side, however.
"Clockwork Cartreuse," with its
none-too-obvious title, deals with
the theme of violence in a way
that is somehow diabolically
funny.
A major part of the success of
these different types of songs is
due to Wainwright's voice. He
changes for every song in order to
exactly fit the lyrics, singing
anything from a sort of male
Melanie to easygoing folksinger
style to hard rock vocals.
Loudon Wainwright's sense of
humor obviously will not appeal
to everyone, but for those who
enjoyed his last effort, Album 111,
Attempted Mustache offers more
of the same. If nothing else, he
shows us logical extensions of
several of our more questionable
ways of thinking.

Derringer: Overdone
Rick Derringer:
All American Boy
Blue Sky KZ 32481

Rick Derringer, who has been a
part of all sorts of rock music in
the last ten years, has just released
his first album under his own
name. Unfortunately, his previous
credits are more impressive.
Derringer was the leader of the
top-40 McCoys during the
mid-60s, and played guitar and
sang with Johnny Winter from
1969 to 1971, when he joined
Edgar Winter's White Trash. He
began producing records with the
McCoys, later producing albums
by both Winters. His guitar work
appears on albums by Richie
Havens, Steely Dan, Todd
Rundgren, and Alice Cooper.
All American Boy represents
Derringer's effort to make it on
his own. All of the tunes are his
own, and mostly new. The
exception is "Rock and Roll
Hoochie Koo," which he wrote
and recorded with Johnny Winter;
this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this
album suffer from
over-production. The string
arrangements get in the way more
than they add to the album;
"Hold" and some moments in
other cuts sound more like Isaac
Hayes than what I would expect
from a rock and roll veteran like
Derringer. "Time Warp" has so
many overdubbed guitar tracks
that it sounds Hike an army of
Rick Derringer clones has just
invaded the room.
Another weak point is
Derringer's vocals. They are
competent, but not up to the
superstar image that he tries to
present on this album. His lyrics
contain nothing quote-worthy.
But the album is not without
its strengths. There are certainly
worse guitarists around than
Derringer. He has demonstrated
his talent and versatility on this
album and elsewhre, and certainly
seems to have the potential to put
out another album which better
shows off his abilities.

New Birth's Best Yet
New Birth:
It's Been A Long Time
RCA APLI-0285
New Birth, one of the finest
new black groups to hit the R&B
scene, has just released a new
album. It's Been A Long Time is
by far the best to date by New
Birth.

The album, featuring the
current radio, hit "Wild Flower,"
contains many songs suitable for
buggin' (dancing — for all you
non-hip listeners out there). New
Birth, often compared to Earth,
Wind and Fire, and to some
extent The Ohio Players, lends
itself a sense of distinction on this
album. In addition to the usual
funky, sometimes jumping,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
New Birth has contributed some
outstanding singing.
Especially notable on "I'll
Spend My Whole Life Loving
You," and "Come and Dream
Some Paradise" are excellent lead
vocals. The lead singer's voice
sounds very much like that of
Stevie Wonder during his earlier
("For Once In My Life," "My
Cherie Amour") period.
Also of note are the back-up
vocals. What sounds like three or
four young ladies does an
excellent job of harmonizing,
filling, and generally enhancing
the richness of the music. Their
perfect phrasing and intertwining
of gospel-like tones lends one to a
feeling of serenity and
contentment. Listen to "Heaven
Says" or the title cut, and you'll
see what I mean.
All in all It's Been A Long
Time is a good effort. Its selection
of fast songs for those who like to

trip the light fantastic, and
equally good slow numbers for
those who'd like a little more,
enjoyment out of dancing, should
send it to the top of the charts.

mean that Mind Games is full of
great music, but that Lennon has
again written a few songs that are
musically and lyrically palatable.
Good, Not Outstanding
The album as a whole is
pleasantly surprising, generally
good. But there is nothing to
make this a truly outstanding
record, worthy of the ex-Beatle's
truly outstanding talent.
This album plays mind games
with its audiences — harkening it
back to John's previous successes.
Much of the album can be picked
up and transferred to some other
point in his musical career.
For example, the vocals are
reminiscent of the intense echo,
spaced out lead of "Instant
Karma." The echo gets out of
hand at times and eventually
becomes tiring, especially in the
slower ballads.
The lyrics stem from John's
long-standing hang ups with peace
and the brotherhood of man.
Apparently he still believes he can
convert the masses of the world to
his ideologies by preaching
through his music. In "Bring on
the Lucie:"
"Well you were caught with
your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow
your pill
As you slip and you slide down
the hill
On the blood of the people
you killed.
Stop the killing now.
Dot it do it do it do it do it
now."
Apologies to Yoko
Other parts of the album
apologize to Yoko, John's wife, as
in "I Know (I Know)," while
songs such as "You Are Here" and
"Out the Blue" are simply
Lennon's love poems to Yoko.
Musically, "Out the Blue" rates
highest on the album. It is clean
and bluesy, beautifully written
and performed. Ken Ascher's
piano solo fits the song perfectly
and is one of the few instrumental
solos on the album.
Lennon's soulful guitar in
"Aisumasen" is the only other
notable solo on the record.
The only real failures in Mind
Games are three tracks which
drag, instrumentally and lyrically.

"One Day (At a Time)," "I Know
(I Know)" and "You Are Here"
seem extremely mushy. But eight
good songs out of 11 is not a bad
average.
Musically Stronger
In contrast to Yoko Ono's
latest release, Feeling the Space
(see review below), the music in
Mind Games is a thousand-fold
improvement. This is odd since
the same musicians who played
rather meekly in Yoko's album
truly hold their own in John's.
Another oddity in Mind Games
is the three-second "Nutopian
National Anthem" at the end of
side one. Only three seconds???
The anthem, three seconds of
silence, proclaims the birth of a
conceptual community that has
no land, no boundaries, no
passports, only people — and all
the people of the nation are
ambassadors, according to the
album liner.
As an ambassador of the
cosmic conceptual community,
John Lennon seems to have
packaged his diplomatic strategies
in an album with some good
music. Finally John has come
down to earth with something
decent to offer the people again.
With the album doing so well, I
just wonder if making loads of
money is legal in Nutopia. . . .

Yoko Doesn't Make It
Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, and
Something Different:
Feeling the Space
Apple SW-3412
Yoko Ono's latest release
comes on like a hard-hitting,
determined women's lib record,
uplifting the downtrodden masses
of females from their bondage in
the "male society." Actually,
Feeling the Space isn't even strong
enough to support itself, much
less all of womankind, in the
cutthroat recording world.
Musically, Yoko and the 14
contributing musicians (all male)
play limp-wristedly. The songs are
not necessarily written poorly,
but sung and played feebly.
Yoko Ono's wobbling, at times
screeching soprano does not give
credibility to songs that come on
strong, with heavy messages, like
"Woman Power:"
"Woman power, woman power
Two thousand years of
male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Cling to values
vain and phony
Woman power, woman power."
Needless to say, Yoko does not
mince words. She is unflinchingly
straight-forward in her lyrics,
which seems incongruous with the
weak music.
Part, but not all, of the
problem with the album can be
traced to Yoko's lack of talent as
a vocalist. However, the producers
and arrangers deserve a good
whipping for releasing such a poor
musical product on the glutted
record scene.

Is He Crazy Or Not?
Loudon Wainwright III:
A ttempted Mustache
Columbia KC 32710
It is tempting to say that

Loudon Wainright 111 is crazy.
After all, who else would write a
song about a "dead skunk in the
middle of the road, stinkin' to
high heaven," or begin a lullaby
with the line "Shut up and go to
bed"? But the more I listen to his
new album, the more I am
convinced that the man is, to
borrow a phrase from playwright
Tom Stoppard, stark raving sane.
Wainwright has a true talent
for isolating and crystallizing bits
of human experience, normal and
otherwise. Some of the songs on
this album deal with simple things
like swimming holes, old friends
meeting again, and the like.
"Dilated to Meet You" is a sort of
song of welcome to an
about-to-be-born child.
Some of the other songs
satirize certain types of people,
sometimes gently, sometimes not.
In "Bell Bottom Pants," he tells
us "If you ain't got the pants you
ain't got a chance at the pop
festival, rock festival, folk festival
or the dance." "Liza" tells of
"pre-pubescent play" with Liza
Minelli, who is not specifically
named but clearly defined in the
song: "Now that you've got your
Oscar I don't think you'll be a
nurse." Neo-Christians will
probably be offended by "I Am
the Way," a song about
you-know-who set to a tune of
Woody Guthrie.
Wainwright also writes about
our darker side, however.
"Clockwork Cartreuse," with its
none-too-obvious title, deals with
the theme of violence in a way
that is somehow diabolically
funny.
A major part of the success of
these different types of songs is
due to Wainwright's voice. He
changes for every song in order to
exactly fit the lyrics, singing
anything from a sort of male
Melanie to easygoing folksinger
style to hard rock vocals.
Loudon Wainwright's sense of
humor obviously will not appeal
to everyone, but for those who
enjoyed his last effort, Album 111,
Attempted Mustache offers more
of the same. If nothing else, he
shows us logical extensions of
several of our more questionable
ways of thinking.

Derringer: Overdone
Rick Derringer:
All American Boy
Blue Sky KZ 32481

Rick Derringer, who has been a
part of all sorts of rock music in
the last ten years, has just released
his first album under his own
name. Unfortunately, his previous
credits are more impressive.
Derringer was the leader of the
top-40 McCoys during the
mid-60s, and played guitar and
sang with Johnny Winter from
1969 to 1971, when he joined
Edgar Winter's White Trash. He
began producing records with the
McCoys, later producing albums
by both Winters. His guitar work
appears on albums by Richie
Havens, Steely Dan, Todd
Rundgren, and Alice Cooper.
All American Boy represents
Derringer's effort to make it on
his own. All of the tunes are his
own, and mostly new. The
exception is "Rock and Roll
Hoochie Koo," which he wrote
and recorded with Johnny Winter;
this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this
album suffer from
over-production. The string
arrangements get in the way more
than they add to the album;
"Hold" and some moments in
other cuts sound more like Isaac
Hayes than what I would expect
from a rock and roll veteran like
Derringer. "Time Warp" has so
many overdubbed guitar tracks
that it sounds Hike an army of
Rick Derringer clones has just
invaded the room.
Another weak point is
Derringer's vocals. They are
competent, but not up to the
superstar image that he tries to
present on this album. His lyrics
contain nothing quote-worthy.
But the album is not without
its strengths. There are certainly
worse guitarists around than
Derringer. He has demonstrated
his talent and versatility on this
album and elsewhre, and certainly
seems to have the potential to put
out another album which better
shows off his abilities.

New Birth's Best Yet
New Birth:
It's Been A Long Time
RCA APLI-0285
New Birth, one of the finest
new black groups to hit the R&B
scene, has just released a new
album. It's Been A Long Time is
by far the best to date by New
Birth.

The album, featuring the
current radio, hit "Wild Flower,"
contains many songs suitable for
buggin' (dancing — for all you
non-hip listeners out there). New
Birth, often compared to Earth,
Wind and Fire, and to some
extent The Ohio Players, lends
itself a sense of distinction on this
album. In addition to the usual
funky, sometimes jumping,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
New Birth has contributed some
outstanding singing.
Especially notable on "I'll
Spend My Whole Life Loving
You," and "Come and Dream
Some Paradise" are excellent lead
vocals. The lead singer's voice
sounds very much like that of
Stevie Wonder during his earlier
("For Once In My Life," "My
Cherie Amour") period.
Also of note are the back-up
vocals. What sounds like three or
four young ladies does an
excellent job of harmonizing,
filling, and generally enhancing
the richness of the music. Their
perfect phrasing and intertwining
of gospel-like tones lends one to a
feeling of serenity and
contentment. Listen to "Heaven
Says" or the title cut, and you'll
see what I mean.
All in all It's Been A Long
Time is a good effort. Its selection
of fast songs for those who like to

trip the light fantastic, and
equally good slow numbers for
those who'd like a little more,
enjoyment out of dancing, should
send it to the top of the charts.

Cannonball Sampler
Cannonball Adderley
Cannonball Adderley and Friends
Capitol SUDB 11233
For almost 20 years, Julian
"Cannonball" Adderley has been
American's best-known alto sax
player, but he has never won more
than grudging compliments from
its jazz critics. Since he first
appeared in the early fifties, he
has been branded an imitator of
the late Charlie Parker's style and
a mere "popularizier" without
any sense of innovation. In this
year's prestigious Down Beat
critics' poll, for example,
Cannonball received only three
votes, about one-tenth as many as
the Alto winner.
Cannonball's latest album,
Cannonball Adderley and Friends,
is made up entirely of re-released
cuts from ten earlier discs, mostly
from his work in the early and
mid--60s. The record presents
Cannonball's immense talent in a
wide range of musical contexts
from blues to bossa nova to bop.

He emerges from the collection as
probably the best all-around alto
player in jazz today.
Two of the record's most
interesting cuts, "Never Will I
Marry" and Parker's "Au
Privave," feature the late guitar
great Wes Montgomery and
capable sidemen Victor Feldman
on vibes and piano and Ray
Brown on bass. All three have
extensive (and excellent) solos,
but Cannonball, very much in a
"Bird" mood, dominates both
tracks with unsurpassed
smoothness and lyricism.
Seven of the two-record set's
18 cuts show Cannonball as an
accompanist for several
outstanding jazz vocalists. For
sheer energy and excitement, Lou
Rawls' "I'd Rather Drink Muddy
Water" is the most fulfilling.
Backed by a ripping electric piano
and an enthusiastic live audience,
Rawls gives a great performance
and Cannonball proves he can
biow with the best.
The album's best cuts feature
Cannonball with pianist Wynton
Kelly, whome he once called "the
perfect accompanist." Cannonball
may not be an innovator, but
these two cuts prove he has more
than enough talent as a performer
to earn recognition as a great jazz
musician.

Lennon's IN'ew Vietory
John Lennon: Mind Games
Apple SW 3414
Rebounding from a disastrous
album (Sometime in New York
City) and recording while battling
with U.S. Immigration officials in
the courts, John Lennon seems to
have pulled a smashing victory
from ignoble defeat with his latest
release, Mind Games.'
The album climbed to number
16 in Billboard's Top 200 albums
in its first week after release,
without the benefit of a top-40
single.
Recently, the title track has
cracked the "top-40 KFRC-KYA
syndrome" and received AM air
play on both Bay Area and Los
Angeles rock stations. Meanwhile,
cuts like "Bring on the Lucie
(Freda Peeple)," "Out the Blue"
and "Only People" have been
making the FM circuits here,
namely KSJO, KSAN and KSFX.
All this publicity and
popularity seem to indicate that
the public is willing to listen to

With the album doing so well, I
just wonder if making loads of
money is legal in Nutopia. . . .

Yoko Doesn't Make It
Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, and
Something Different:
Feeling the Space
Apple SW-3412
Yoko Ono's latest release
comes on like a hard-hitting,
determined women's lib record,
uplifting the downtrodden masses
of females from their bondage in
the "male society." Actually,
Feeling the Space isn't even strong
enough to support itself, much
less all of womankind, in the
cutthroat recording world.
Musically, Yoko and the 14
contributing musicians (all male)
play limp-wristedly. The songs are
not necessarily written poorly,
but sung and played feebly.
Yoko Ono's wobbling, at times
screeching soprano does not give
credibility to songs that come on
strong, with heavy messages, like
"Woman Power:"
"Woman power, woman power
Two thousand years of
male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Cling to values
vain and phony
Woman power, woman power."
Needless to say, Yoko does not
mince words. She is unflinchingly
straight-forward in her lyrics,
which seems incongruous with the
weak music.
Part, but not all, of the
problem with the album can be
traced to Yoko's lack of talent as
a vocalist. However, the producers
and arrangers deserve a good
whipping for releasing such a poor
musical product on the glutted
record scene.

Is He Crazy Or Not?
Loudon Wainwright III:
A ttempted Mustache
Columbia KC 32710
It is tempting to say that

Loudon Wainright 111 is crazy.
After all, who else would write a
song about a "dead skunk in the
middle of the road, stinkin' to
high heaven," or begin a lullaby
with the line "Shut up and go to
bed"? But the more I listen to his
new album, the more I am
convinced that the man is, to
borrow a phrase from playwright
Tom Stoppard, stark raving sane.
Wainwright has a true talent
for isolating and crystallizing bits
of human experience, normal and
otherwise. Some of the songs on
this album deal with simple things
like swimming holes, old friends
meeting again, and the like.
"Dilated to Meet You" is a sort of
song of welcome to an
about-to-be-born child.
Some of the other songs
satirize certain types of people,
sometimes gently, sometimes not.
In "Bell Bottom Pants," he tells
us "If you ain't got the pants you
ain't got a chance at the pop
festival, rock festival, folk festival
or the dance." "Liza" tells of
"pre-pubescent play" with Liza
Minelli, who is not specifically
named but clearly defined in the
song: "Now that you've got your
Oscar I don't think you'll be a
nurse." Neo-Christians will
probably be offended by "I Am
the Way," a song about
you-know-who set to a tune of
Woody Guthrie.
Wainwright also writes about
our darker side, however.
"Clockwork Cartreuse," with its
none-too-obvious title, deals with
the theme of violence in a way
that is somehow diabolically
funny.
A major part of the success of
these different types of songs is
due to Wainwright's voice. He
changes for every song in order to
exactly fit the lyrics, singing
anything from a sort of male
Melanie to easygoing folksinger
style to hard rock vocals.
Loudon Wainwright's sense of
humor obviously will not appeal
to everyone, but for those who
enjoyed his last effort, Album 111,
Attempted Mustache offers more
of the same. If nothing else, he
shows us logical extensions of
several of our more questionable
ways of thinking.

Derringer: Overdone
Rick Derringer:
All American Boy
Blue Sky KZ 32481

Rick Derringer, who has been a
part of all sorts of rock music in
the last ten years, has just released
his first album under his own
name. Unfortunately, his previous
credits are more impressive.
Derringer was the leader of the
top-40 McCoys during the
mid-60s, and played guitar and
sang with Johnny Winter from
1969 to 1971, when he joined
Edgar Winter's White Trash. He
began producing records with the
McCoys, later producing albums
by both Winters. His guitar work
appears on albums by Richie
Havens, Steely Dan, Todd
Rundgren, and Alice Cooper.
All American Boy represents
Derringer's effort to make it on
his own. All of the tunes are his
own, and mostly new. The
exception is "Rock and Roll
Hoochie Koo," which he wrote
and recorded with Johnny Winter;
this version is almost as good as
the live cut on Johnny Winter
And.
Most of the songs on this
album suffer from
over-production. The string
arrangements get in the way more
than they add to the album;
"Hold" and some moments in
other cuts sound more like Isaac
Hayes than what I would expect
from a rock and roll veteran like
Derringer. "Time Warp" has so
many overdubbed guitar tracks
that it sounds Hike an army of
Rick Derringer clones has just
invaded the room.
Another weak point is
Derringer's vocals. They are
competent, but not up to the
superstar image that he tries to
present on this album. His lyrics
contain nothing quote-worthy.
But the album is not without
its strengths. There are certainly
worse guitarists around than
Derringer. He has demonstrated
his talent and versatility on this
album and elsewhre, and certainly
seems to have the potential to put
out another album which better
shows off his abilities.

New Birth's Best Yet
New Birth:
It's Been A Long Time
RCA APLI-0285
New Birth, one of the finest
new black groups to hit the R&B
scene, has just released a new
album. It's Been A Long Time is
by far the best to date by New
Birth.

The album, featuring the
current radio, hit "Wild Flower,"
contains many songs suitable for
buggin' (dancing — for all you
non-hip listeners out there). New
Birth, often compared to Earth,
Wind and Fire, and to some
extent The Ohio Players, lends
itself a sense of distinction on this
album. In addition to the usual
funky, sometimes jumping,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
New Birth has contributed some
outstanding singing.
Especially notable on "I'll
Spend My Whole Life Loving
You," and "Come and Dream
Some Paradise" are excellent lead
vocals. The lead singer's voice
sounds very much like that of
Stevie Wonder during his earlier
("For Once In My Life," "My
Cherie Amour") period.
Also of note are the back-up
vocals. What sounds like three or
four young ladies does an
excellent job of harmonizing,
filling, and generally enhancing
the richness of the music. Their
perfect phrasing and intertwining
of gospel-like tones lends one to a
feeling of serenity and
contentment. Listen to "Heaven
Says" or the title cut, and you'll
see what I mean.
All in all It's Been A Long
Time is a good effort. Its selection
of fast songs for those who like to

trip the light fantastic, and
equally good slow numbers for
those who'd like a little more,
enjoyment out of dancing, should
send it to the top of the charts.

Cannonball Sampler
Cannonball Adderley
Cannonball Adderley and Friends
Capitol SUDB 11233
For almost 20 years, Julian
"Cannonball" Adderley has been
American's best-known alto sax
player, but he has never won more
than grudging compliments from
its jazz critics. Since he first
appeared in the early fifties, he
has been branded an imitator of
the late Charlie Parker's style and
a mere "popularizier" without
any sense of innovation. In this
year's prestigious Down Beat
critics' poll, for example,
Cannonball received only three
votes, about one-tenth as many as
the Alto winner.
Cannonball's latest album,
Cannonball Adderley and Friends,
is made up entirely of re-released
cuts from ten earlier discs, mostly
from his work in the early and
mid--60s. The record presents
Cannonball's immense talent in a
wide range of musical contexts
from blues to bossa nova to bop.

He emerges from the collection as
probably the best all-around alto
player in jazz today.
Two of the record's most
interesting cuts, "Never Will I
Marry" and Parker's "Au
Privave," feature the late guitar
great Wes Montgomery and
capable sidemen Victor Feldman
on vibes and piano and Ray
Brown on bass. All three have
extensive (and excellent) solos,
but Cannonball, very much in a
"Bird" mood, dominates both
tracks with unsurpassed
smoothness and lyricism.
Seven of the two-record set's
18 cuts show Cannonball as an
accompanist for several
outstanding jazz vocalists. For
sheer energy and excitement, Lou
Rawls' "I'd Rather Drink Muddy
Water" is the most fulfilling.
Backed by a ripping electric piano
and an enthusiastic live audience,
Rawls gives a great performance
and Cannonball proves he can
biow with the best.
The album's best cuts feature
Cannonball with pianist Wynton
Kelly, whome he once called "the
perfect accompanist." Cannonball
may not be an innovator, but
these two cuts prove he has more
than enough talent as a performer
to earn recognition as a great jazz
musician.
