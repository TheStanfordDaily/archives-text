# Engineering Student Dies
## 
### 
Theodore R. Vilas 11, 26, a graduate
student in mechanical engineering
from Sonora, Calif., collapsed and died
of a heart attack while playing
basketball between Wilbur and Stern
Halls Tuesday.
Palo Alto Medical Clinic
cardiologist Joel P. Friedman, who saw
Vilas once in consultation, said the
student was suffering from a "severe
heart disease which has an increased
risk of sudden death associated with
it."
A University spokesman said Vilas
had been warned several times to limit
his physical activities. Stanford
firemen were called to the scene at
4:50 p.m. and administered artificial
respiration and external cardiac

massage to Vilas before he was
removed by ambulance to Stanford
Hospital. Doctors there declared him
dead on arrival at 5:04 p.m.
Vilas' academic adviser, Associate
Dean of Engineering Robert H. Eustis,
said Vilas was a doctoral candidate in
the Mechanical Engineering
Department and had worked as a
research assistant at the department's
High Temperature Gasdynamics
Laboratory.
Having received his bachelor's
degree from the University of
California at Davis, Vilas came here in
autumn 1970 and received his master's
degree one year later. Eustis said Vilas
was to have finished his doctoral work
next year.
