# Unpredictable Cards Cause Heartbreak, Jubilation
## Hungry Wolfpack Wins Opening Nightmare 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If you witnessed Monday's Maples miracle, you're probably
wondering how Stanford, with all those big guns, could lose to
supposedly-weak Nevada-Reno, 76-69.
The answer is that while the big guns played fairly well in Friday's
season opener, the little guns couldn't shoot.
In all, the five players who alternated at the point and wing
positions in the Cardinals' double-post offense hit on a grand total of
10 of 41 shots, missing a surprising number of cripples as well as
outside shots.
"We were prepared and ready to play," murmured a subdued
Howie Dallmar after the game. "It was very frustrating to miss all
those shots inside."

But even with the poor
shooting, Reno had to play a great
game to beat the much taller
Cardinals, and did so. Wolfpack
forward Marvin Buckley scored a
total of 19 points, mostly on
layups in the first half.
Kelley Over Padgett
In that half, Stanford stayed
within one point of the lead only
because Rich Kelley completely
dominated Pete Padgett, Nevada's
star and the son of the coach.
Padgett hit only one of nine
shots in that half, playing inside
against Kelley. In the second half,
the elder Padgett told his son to
move outside, and Pete responded
by hitting a couple of 20-footers
that forced Kelley out to greet
him.
Dallmar then removed Tim
Patterson from the game in order
to utilize the quickness of Ed
Schweitzer in the middle. This left
Stanford without its most potent
outside shooting threat.
So, to make a long story short,
with no outside shooting to worry
about, Nevada double-teamed
Kelley, and when Kelley fouled
out, it was all over.
Despite the tight guarding of
Kelley, the seven-foot center still
managed to lead the Cards with
18 points, and also tied for the
team lead in rebounding with 12.
Patterson also had 12 rebounds.
Foreshadowing
Both Schweitzer and forward
Dave Frost foreshadowed their
accomplishments of Monday night
with solid games on Friday.
Schweitzer scored 10 second half
points, eight of which came on
layups. And Frost, coming off the
bench in the second half with the
Cards down 47-36, brought
Stanford right back into the game.
He made a driving layup, tied
Mike Larios into knots with
aggressive defense and hit a
12-foot jumper. The crowd
responded by giving him the
second-biggest hand of the night.
(The band and dollies got the
biggest ovation at the end of their
rendition of the William Tell
Overture.)
Otherwise, it was pretty
depressing for the 4364 fans on
hand. Mel Arterberry, Scott
Trobbe and Jim Montague each
missed a plethora of shots which
barely eluded the hoop.
The Nevada players and
coaches reacted to their victory in
much the same way as did their
counterparts from Stanford on
Monday — with a mob scene at
the end of the game. "You have
to be gratified with a win like
this," coach Padgett said. "All our
players played well."
The Wolfpack were picked for
next-to-last in the West Coast
Athletic Conference while San
Francisco was picked for first. So
Padgett's probably feeling even
better now.

FAST EDDIE — Ed Schweitzer (44), a sophomore "who doesn't play
like a sophomore" according to Stanford coach Howie Dallmar, came
off the bench to score 22 points in the Cards' opening games against
Nevada-Reno and USF. Schweitzer connected on 11 of 21 shots in the
two contests.
If you witnessed Monday's Maples miracle, you're probably
wondering how Stanford, with all those big guns, could lose to
supposedly-weak Nevada-Reno, 76-69.
The answer is that while the big guns played fairly well in Friday's
season opener, the little guns couldn't shoot.
In all, the five players who alternated at the point and wing
positions in the Cardinals' double-post offense hit on a grand total of
10 of 41 shots, missing a surprising number of cripples as well as
outside shots.
"We were prepared and ready to play," murmured a subdued
Howie Dallmar after the game. "It was very frustrating to miss all
those shots inside."

But even with the poor
shooting, Reno had to play a great
game to beat the much taller
Cardinals, and did so. Wolfpack
forward Marvin Buckley scored a
total of 19 points, mostly on
layups in the first half.
Kelley Over Padgett
In that half, Stanford stayed
within one point of the lead only
because Rich Kelley completely
dominated Pete Padgett, Nevada's
star and the son of the coach.
Padgett hit only one of nine
shots in that half, playing inside
against Kelley. In the second half,
the elder Padgett told his son to
move outside, and Pete responded
by hitting a couple of 20-footers
that forced Kelley out to greet
him.
Dallmar then removed Tim
Patterson from the game in order
to utilize the quickness of Ed
Schweitzer in the middle. This left
Stanford without its most potent
outside shooting threat.
So, to make a long story short,
with no outside shooting to worry
about, Nevada double-teamed
Kelley, and when Kelley fouled
out, it was all over.
Despite the tight guarding of
Kelley, the seven-foot center still
managed to lead the Cards with
18 points, and also tied for the
team lead in rebounding with 12.
Patterson also had 12 rebounds.
Foreshadowing
Both Schweitzer and forward
Dave Frost foreshadowed their
accomplishments of Monday night
with solid games on Friday.
Schweitzer scored 10 second half
points, eight of which came on
layups. And Frost, coming off the
bench in the second half with the
Cards down 47-36, brought
Stanford right back into the game.
He made a driving layup, tied
Mike Larios into knots with
aggressive defense and hit a
12-foot jumper. The crowd
responded by giving him the
second-biggest hand of the night.
(The band and dollies got the
biggest ovation at the end of their
rendition of the William Tell
Overture.)
Otherwise, it was pretty
depressing for the 4364 fans on
hand. Mel Arterberry, Scott
Trobbe and Jim Montague each
missed a plethora of shots which
barely eluded the hoop.
The Nevada players and
coaches reacted to their victory in
much the same way as did their
counterparts from Stanford on
Monday — with a mob scene at
the end of the game. "You have
to be gratified with a win like
this," coach Padgett said. "All our
players played well."
The Wolfpack were picked for
next-to-last in the West Coast
Athletic Conference while San
Francisco was picked for first. So
Padgett's probably feeling even
better now.

FAST EDDIE — Ed Schweitzer (44), a sophomore "who doesn't play
like a sophomore" according to Stanford coach Howie Dallmar, came
off the bench to score 22 points in the Cards' opening games against
Nevada-Reno and USF. Schweitzer connected on 11 of 21 shots in the
two contests.
If you witnessed Monday's Maples miracle, you're probably
wondering how Stanford, with all those big guns, could lose to
supposedly-weak Nevada-Reno, 76-69.
The answer is that while the big guns played fairly well in Friday's
season opener, the little guns couldn't shoot.
In all, the five players who alternated at the point and wing
positions in the Cardinals' double-post offense hit on a grand total of
10 of 41 shots, missing a surprising number of cripples as well as
outside shots.
"We were prepared and ready to play," murmured a subdued
Howie Dallmar after the game. "It was very frustrating to miss all
those shots inside."

But even with the poor
shooting, Reno had to play a great
game to beat the much taller
Cardinals, and did so. Wolfpack
forward Marvin Buckley scored a
total of 19 points, mostly on
layups in the first half.
Kelley Over Padgett
In that half, Stanford stayed
within one point of the lead only
because Rich Kelley completely
dominated Pete Padgett, Nevada's
star and the son of the coach.
Padgett hit only one of nine
shots in that half, playing inside
against Kelley. In the second half,
the elder Padgett told his son to
move outside, and Pete responded
by hitting a couple of 20-footers
that forced Kelley out to greet
him.
Dallmar then removed Tim
Patterson from the game in order
to utilize the quickness of Ed
Schweitzer in the middle. This left
Stanford without its most potent
outside shooting threat.
So, to make a long story short,
with no outside shooting to worry
about, Nevada double-teamed
Kelley, and when Kelley fouled
out, it was all over.
Despite the tight guarding of
Kelley, the seven-foot center still
managed to lead the Cards with
18 points, and also tied for the
team lead in rebounding with 12.
Patterson also had 12 rebounds.
Foreshadowing
Both Schweitzer and forward
Dave Frost foreshadowed their
accomplishments of Monday night
with solid games on Friday.
Schweitzer scored 10 second half
points, eight of which came on
layups. And Frost, coming off the
bench in the second half with the
Cards down 47-36, brought
Stanford right back into the game.
He made a driving layup, tied
Mike Larios into knots with
aggressive defense and hit a
12-foot jumper. The crowd
responded by giving him the
second-biggest hand of the night.
(The band and dollies got the
biggest ovation at the end of their
rendition of the William Tell
Overture.)
Otherwise, it was pretty
depressing for the 4364 fans on
hand. Mel Arterberry, Scott
Trobbe and Jim Montague each
missed a plethora of shots which
barely eluded the hoop.
The Nevada players and
coaches reacted to their victory in
much the same way as did their
counterparts from Stanford on
Monday — with a mob scene at
the end of the game. "You have
to be gratified with a win like
this," coach Padgett said. "All our
players played well."
The Wolfpack were picked for
next-to-last in the West Coast
Athletic Conference while San
Francisco was picked for first. So
Padgett's probably feeling even
better now.
