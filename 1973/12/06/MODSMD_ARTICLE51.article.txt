# Pae-8 Roundup
## Bruins Survive...Barely 
### 
Maybe, just maybe, UCLA can be beaten.
Saturday night's 65-64 thriller against Maryland
didn't end the Bruins' 77-game winning streak, but
it certainly provided at least a glimmer of hope for
the frustrated seven — the coaches who along with
John Wooden direct basketball teams in the Pacific
Eight conference.
Saturday at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins showed
that they are mortal — just like the rest of the teams
in the nation. Even Bill Walton, who grabbed an
amazing 27 rebounds, had an off night shooting and
finished with only 18 points. Keith Wilkes also had
trouble finding the hoop, and if it weren't for a
crucial mistake with four seconds remaining,
Maryland might have won.
The Terrapins had the ball with 20 seconds left.
Guard John Lucas dribbled the ball upcourt, kept
dribbling, kept dribbling. .. Then, with four
seconds on the clock, UCLA's Dave Meyers stole the
ball and insured the Bruins' 77th straight victory.
(UCLA had recorded number 76 the night before
with a 101-79 triumph over Arkansas.)
Across town. Bob Boyd's USC Trojans pulled an
upset of sorts Saturday night by upending Arizona,
the ninth-ranked team in Sports Illustrated's
preseason listings. Gus Williams, a guard Boyd says
is "as good physically as anyone we've ever had,"
scored 29 points in the 100-76 victory.
Oregon, generally picked for second, third or
fourth in the conference, flattened U. of Americas
105-61 Friday but suffered a major upset in its
second outing. Montana State edged the Ducks
75-72 Saturday night. Tuesday, Oregon thrashed
Los Angeles State, 89-58.
Washington State, last year's cellar-dwellers,
opened its new 12,000 seat Performing Arts Center
in grand style Saturday night, upsetting LSU, 80-78.

Washington, meanwhile, crushed Montana State
107-76 Friday night but dropped an 87-79 overtime
decision to Missouri Valley power Wichita State
Saturday.
Oregon State split a pair, trouncing hapless U. of
Americas 105-61 Saturday before losing to New
Mexico's highly regarded Lobos Monday. OSU was
in contention for a half on the strength of Rich
Plante's 20 points, but Plante managed only three in
the second half as New Mexico pulled away.
California warmed up for a tough Eastern swing
(the Bears played North Carolina last night and will
compete in the Mountaineer Classic this weekend)
with an 85-40 win over a team from New South
Wales, Australia.
