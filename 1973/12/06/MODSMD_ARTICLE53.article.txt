# Cardinal Knowledge
## Consistency Is The Key 
### Stan Wilson 
If, zfter watching Stanford
upset seventh-ranked USF
Monday night you think the Cards
are the best team in the nation,
then forget it; you're dead wrong.
But if you think the Cards are
incapable of beating the nation's
number-one cage team, then
you're just as mistaken.
The tall, talented Cardinals
showed in their two opening
games what they showed all last
season — flashes of brilliance
blended with inconsistency, a
combination that makes for
exciting and unpredictable
basketball. The same team which
lost to Colorado State and WSU
last year also managed to upset
USC and scare the seemingly
invincible UCLA Bruins.
Stanford has shown that it will
win quite a few games on the
strength of its towering front line
and team depth. Coach Howie
Dallmar has used 10 players in
each of his first two games. The
strength of his bench can be seen
in the fact that only two players
who started the game against USF
were on the floor when the final
buzzer sounded.
One of those was sophomore
Ed Schweitzer, a slender 6-8
forward who has come off the
bench to score 22 points in two
games, and who was probably the
only eager to turn in consistent
efforts in both those outings.
"Schweitzer played just
super," commented forward Dave

Frost Monday night, and coaches
Dallmar and Bub Bowling
concurred.
Frost didn't play too badly
himself. The rugged senior was to
a large extent responsible for
shutting off USF's All-America
candidate Kevin Restani, a 6-10
forward who usually makes more
than half of his shots. Monday,
though, Restani didn't hit a
bucket until the overtime period.
"I was just trying to get in his
way," Frost said after the game.
"Maybe he just wasn't up to par."
Maybe. But perhaps USF coach
Bob Gaillard's analysis is a bit
more accurate. "Kevin didn't have
a real good shooting night. But
Frost did a real good job
defensing him man-to-man."
The difference in the two
games was that on Monday night
the Cards came mentally prepared
to play, and after overcoming
Friday night's first-game jitters,
they were able to play with
confidence. "There's no doubt
that we played with more
emotion tonight," Frost said after
the upset win Monday night.
Junior forward Scott Trobbe,
who started against Reno Friday
and turned in only a mediocre
performance, came off the bench
Monday to shut off the Dons' Phil
Smith late in the game, as well as
scoring the winning bucket by
tipping in center Rich Kelley's
missed jumper. "We played with
more confidence tonight — that

goes for everybody," said Trobbe.
But Dallmar remained
perplexed. "There's no excuse for
not playing with emotion against
Nevada-Reno. You've just gotta
be enthused for the opener."
If the Cards can get enthused
for every game this year, they'll
win a lot of basketball games.
The outside shooting at the
guard position remains a vital
question mark if the Cards are to
alleviate some of the pressure on
the big men inside. Mark Gilberg
can be a threat from outside, but
he usually needs a little coaxing.
But the big question will be
consistency. With it Stanford will
finish second or third in the Pac-8,
and have one of its most
successful seasons in years.
Without it, the Cards could easily
wind up with another 7-7
conference mark in a league which
is probably the toughest in the
country.
