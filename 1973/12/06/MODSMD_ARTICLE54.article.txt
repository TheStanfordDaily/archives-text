# An Upset? A Miracle? Or Is Stanford Just Better Than USF
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
After it was all over, after
5070 delirious fans had cheered,
stomped and bitten their nails,
after Stanford's ecstatic Cardinals
had staged a jubilant mob scene at
midcourt, USF coach Bob
Gaillard paused, thought for a
second and quietly put the whole
thing in its proper perspective.
"I don't think it was much of
an upset," Gaillard said after his
Dons had lost a 63-61 overtime
decision to the Cards Monday
night. "Stanford isn't going to
lose too many games at home.
"They'll always be good when
they're close or ahead. They're so
big — they can dictate the tempo
of the game."
Friday night, of course,
Stanford hadn't won at home.
The Cards got behind against
Nevada-Reno, panicked, rushed
shots and eventually lost the
game.
So even if Monday's Cardinal
heroics weren't particularly
shocking to Gaillard, the victory
simply overwhelmed Stanford's
fans, most of whom came to
Maples to see the 11th ranked
Dons (seventh if you read Sports
Illustrated) or possibly just to
escape Dead Week Drudgery.
Whatever the reason, the fans
were delighted. Stanford, trailing
by precariously slim margins most
of the game, rallied in the second
half to send the contest into
overtime. And then the Cards
took control. They never trailed
during the five-minute extra
session, and when Scott Trobbe
tipped in a missed Rich Kelley
layup with seven seconds left, the
Dons were done in.
Last Chance
Oh, USF had one more chance.
With five seconds to go, the Dons
rushed the ball upcourt for one
more shot. All they could get,
though, was a desperation
25-footer, which All-American
candidate Kevin Restani
appropriately missed as the final
buzzer sounded. It was the 13th
miss of the game for Restani, who
connected only once from the
field during a very frustrating
evening.
"If Kevin has half a normal
game we're going to be in
control," Gaillard said afterward,
but Restani, who last year
averaged 17.6 points per game and
shot 51.3 percent from the field,
was far from normal.
"I'm not faulting Kevin,"
Gaillard said. "He took his regular
shots but they just didn't go in."
One reason they didn't was
some aggressive defense by Card
forward Dave Frost. "Dave did a
super job on Restani when we
were playing man-to-man," said
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar.
And when Stanford was in one of

its three zones, the Cards were
equally effective. "We played
with more poise defensively" than
Friday night, Kelley said.
'Drainer'
Offensively, Stanford was still
sloppy and didn't exactly burn
the nets from outside, but the
Cardinal attack was far from
dormant. Kelley, physically
drained after playing 38 minutes
in what Dallmar called an
emotional "drainer," still
managed to score 16 points, grab
13 rebounds and contribute five
assists.
Twice, he even led the fast
break, motoring his seven-foot
frame down the court so
gracefully that USF center Eric
Fernsten's already contorted
expressions assumed seemingly
fatal proportions. Both .times,
Kelley flipped deft passes to his
driving teammates and the Cards
scored easily.
The offense was most effective
when Dallmar employed a
rafter-reaching front line of Kelley,
6-11 Tim Patterson and 6-9 Ed
Schweitzer, a lineup the Cards had

rarely tried in practice, much less
against a nationally ranked
opponent. Still, the lineup
produced points, and Dallmar said
he'll probably "stay with that big
team a lot from now on."
When the three big men were
in the game along with 6-6 guard
Scott Trobbe, USF countered
with Restani (6-10), Fernsten
(6-9), Howard Smith (6-9) and 6-4
guard Phil Smith, producing one
of the biggest groups of players
ever to set foot on the same
basketball court.
Errors Disappear
With all those big men on the
floor, the earlier errors
surprisingly disappeared. USF
committed 19 turnovers overall —
the Cards 17, but the closing
minutes of regulation play and the
overtime period were practically
void of fouls and flaws.
But back to that furious finish.
There were 27 seconds remaining
when John Boro connected on a
17-foot jump shot. Stanford
immediately called time out and
Dallmar ordered a delay game —
unless, of course, a lane opened
up to the basket. With 10 seconds
left, just as the Cards were about
to set up for the final shot, Kelley
spotted an opening.
He drove down the middle,
partially eluded Phil Smith and
put the ball toward the hoop. It
hit the rim and bounced fatefully
into the waiting hands of Trobbe,
who tipped it in for the winning
score.
Was it a lucky shot, or a case of
"just being in the right place at
the right time?" "Hell no,"
quipped a smiling Trobbe. "Rich
and I have been working on that
play all week."

Cardinal Notes: "The Smith
boys were something," said
Dallmar, complimenting the play
of USF forward Howard Smith
(18 points, 9-13 from the field)
and Phil Smith (no relation),
whose smooth play netted 24
points and seven rebounds.
Stanford now breaks for finals
before returning to action on Dec.
15 against Colorado State at
Maples. The Cards then travel to
Moraga for a Dec. 17 game against
St. Mary's before heading east for
the Kentucky Classic (Dec. 21-22)
and the Holiday Festival in New
York (Dec. 26-29).

SHOT REJECTOR — Center Rich Kelley, who blocked 10 shots against Nevada-Reno, heartily returns
this Marvin Buckley attempt Friday night as Dave Frost (33), Jim Montague (31) and Melvin Arterberry
(34) look on. Kelley scored 18 points and siared 12 rebounds in Stanford's 1973-74 debut, but the Cards
were upset by the Wolfpack, 76-69.

TIP FOR TWO — Senior forward Mike Mann tips in a basket Monday
night against USF. Mann contributed six points as the Cards shocked
the nationally ranked Dons, 63-61 in overtime.
