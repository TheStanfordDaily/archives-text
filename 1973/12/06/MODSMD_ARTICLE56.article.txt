STANDING PAT — Junior defensive end Pat Donovan was
named to the Associated Press All-America football team
released Tuesday. Earlier Roger Stillwell was selected to the
Football News All-America squad, so opposing runners will
face a double problem against the Cards in 1974 — an
All-American will anchor both sides of the defensive line.
