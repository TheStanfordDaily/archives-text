# No More Jitters For JV Cagers
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
"The first-game jitters are
over" for Stanford's junior varsity
basketball squad, assistant coach
Bob Buell pronounced Monday
night after his men downed
Gavilan College, 70-61.
Those "jitters" had led to a
66-55 thrashing by San Francisco
City College in the season opener
three nights before, but were
rarely in evidence Monday as the
Cards succeeded in proving head
coach Billy Jones wrong on at
least one count this season.
Jones had said last week that
his team would be "outmanned
every time we go to center court,"
but if Stanford was outmanned by
the Rams Monday, it must have
been by men who sat on the
Gavilan bench.
Strong shooting by guard Terry
McCartin and surprising reserve
Sven Walker (15 points apiece) led
the Cardinal attack against
Gavilan.
Buell also credited "a hell of a
job on the boards" by 6-8 center
Scott Russell, whom he said had
missed two prior days of practice
because of sickness.
'Dictated Tempo'
Buell had said after the SF City
loss, "We can't let the other team
dictate .. . we've got to play
really smart," and in the
victorious dressing room Monday
he spoke of how the small,
scrappy Cards had "dictated the
tempo" of that evening's contest.
Stanford led Gavilan through
most of the game, but suffered a
cold shooting streak at one stage
of the second half and fell behind,
49-48, with 8:30 left. McCartin
and Russell then got hot and put
the game out of reach.

McCartin, whom Jones had
earlier spotted as his "best
shooter," also led Stanford scorers
in Friday's opener with 13 points.
Russell collected 11 re bounds
in that game and got eight
Monday while up against Gavilan's
6-6, 220-pound Ben Dawson, who
picked up 13 rebounds and 23
points himself.
Raw Talent
Buell, in a KZSU interview
after Friday's loss, said Russell is
"extremely quick" and "has a lot
of raw talent," but "doesn't look
like he's ever been coached that
much."
During the interview, the
Stanford assistant said the Cards
had not shot or passed well that
night, and were "really tense."
The differences between the
first and second games were
startling, however. Stanford
improved its field goal percentage
from .352 to .440 and its free
throw percentage from .385 to
.522, gained 10 more rebounds
and cut its personal fouls almost
in half.
One of the reasons was reserve
Walker, not mentioned by Jones
in his pre-season outlook. Walker,
6-2, 185, added six rebounds to
his point total Monday.
Also a factor was the
continued fine play of sophomore
Marty Moroski (seven rebounds,
13 points), who gained a starting
spot immediately after dropping
from varsity.
Jones' squad now gets a long
layoff before /losing the Santa
Clara JV on Januaiv 4.
