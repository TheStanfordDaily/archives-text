# Local Department Store Santas: All Child's Play?
## 
### PATTY FELS 
It's pretty hard to keep a kid
believing in Santa Claus any more. But
for one month a year, Don Hines and
Milton Kubiak make that their job.
Any child who talks to them will leave
fairly sure, if not certain, that Santa
Claus is alive and well and living at
Sears or Macy's.
Kubiak, a 25-year-old math major
at San Jose State, has doubled as Santa
Claus for two years, although this is
his first year at Macy's. He's hired by a
temporary help agency, which rents
him out to department stores and
private parties. The agency provides
him with his $500 costume —
complete with a false wig and a foam
rubber stomach — and pays him $3 an
hour.
During the rest of the year. Hines,
50, works as a foreman in a cannery.
He's spending his one-month vacation
being the Sears Santa.
Although he enjoys his job, he
confides that no one at the cannery
knows what he's doing — "I don't tell
my boss. I'm not too sure why I don't
tell him, but I don't." Hines does not
work through an agency.
At Sears, Santa Claus is a big deal.

"We started the Saturday before
Thanksgiving," Hines recalls. "I heard
on the news that night that Santa was
going to enter Sears."
While working, Hines sits in a
conspicuous display with a draped red
background, a white furry chair and
huge candy canes. He is right next to
the main door, and Santa signs point
him out.
Macy's Santa, on the other hand, is
almost impossible to find. Hidden in
the children's department in a room
filled with old cribs, Kubiak and his
"elf" Jane Vantamelen complain that
people don't notice them.
No Child Molesters
There are relatively few
requirements to play a Santa. At Sears,
Hines needed only a personal
recommendation. The agency,
however, is a little more picky. "You
don't want some people with a high,
squeaky voice which doesn't work for
Santa," Kubiak explains. "And anyone
who's been arrested for child
molesting is sort of out."
Both Kubiak and Hines said that
they have a hard time telling boys
from girls. "A little girl with long hair
said 'Hiya Santa' in a deep voice," said

Kubiak. "1 thought I'd made another
mistake and said, 'Hiya Son.' She said
'I'm a girl.' "
Despite the similarity in hair styles,
boys and girls still ask for traditional
toys, according to the two Santas.
Both mentioned "Baby Alive," a doll
that drinks and wets, as being the most
popular girls' toy. "They must have
done a real advertising job on her,"
says Kubiak. Boys usually ask for war
toys — especially G.I. Joe sets.
'Damn Near Everything'
Occasionally, children can't think
of anything they want when they sit
on Santa's lap. "I had this one kid last
year who invented a toy," said
Kubiak. "He was at a loss for words so
he invented it. I kept asking him what
it was and he went on and on. As near
as I could tell this toy did damn near
everything."
Fewer kids believe in Santa Claus
this year, according to Kubiak. Hines
remembers one six-year-old who
noticed his "fake moustache."
Some kids try to trip up Santa.
"Yesterday I had one little boy ask me
the names of the reindeer," said
Kubiak. "For the first time in my life I

got all nine right. Then he asked me
the names of the reindeer's wives."
About a fourth of the kids are still
afraid of Santa Claus, according to the
two Santas. "A lot of the time 1 think
it's the parents' fault," said Kubiak.
"They keep asking the kid whether
he's going to cry — until he does."
Often parents are really anxious to
get the "picture with Santa" and will
force their children up to Kubiak.
"I've seen the kid get kicked in the
shin to get him up there," says
Vantamelen.
"From age one-and-a-half to
two-and-a-half there's the 'God, what
is this?' reaction," says Hines. "Before
and after that they're 0.K." Both have
talked to children under six weeks old.
Both Santas say that they love their
jobs. Although they remember some
grim parts, like the time a little boy
got his sucker stuck in Kubiak's beard,
they can recall countless wonderful
times. "A week ago I asked a little boy
what he wanted and he said 'world
peace,' " said Kubiak. "I was pretty
impressed and asked if he wanted
anything else. He thought a minute
and then said, 'A machine gun — to
kill all the bad people.' "

fairly sure, if not certain, that Santa
Claus is alive and well and living at
Sears or Macy's.
Kubiak, a 25-year-old math major
at San Jose State, has doubled as Santa
Claus for two years, although this is
his first year at Macy's. He's hired by a
temporary help agency, which rents
him out to department stores and
private parties. The agency provides
him with his $500 costume —
complete with a false wig and a foam
rubber stomach — and pays him $3 an
hour.
During the rest of the year. Hines,
50, works as a foreman in a cannery.
He's spending his one-month vacation
being the Sears Santa.
Although he enjoys his job, he
confides that no one at the cannery
knows what he's doing — "I don't tell
my boss. I'm not too sure why I don't
tell him, but I don't." Hines does not
work through an agency.
At Sears, Santa Claus is a big deal.

"We started the Saturday before
Thanksgiving," Hines recalls. "I heard
on the news that night that Santa was
going to enter Sears."
While working, Hines sits in a
conspicuous display with a draped red
background, a white furry chair and
huge candy canes. He is right next to
the main door, and Santa signs point
him out.
Macy's Santa, on the other hand, is
almost impossible to find. Hidden in
the children's department in a room
filled with old cribs, Kubiak and his
"elf" Jane Vantamelen complain that
people don't notice them.
No Child Molesters
There are relatively few
requirements to play a Santa. At Sears,
Hines needed only a personal
recommendation. The agency,
however, is a little more picky. "You
don't want some people with a high,
squeaky voice which doesn't work for
Santa," Kubiak explains. "And anyone
who's been arrested for child
molesting is sort of out."
Both Kubiak and Hines said that
they have a hard time telling boys
from girls. "A little girl with long hair
said 'Hiya Santa' in a deep voice," said

Kubiak. "1 thought I'd made another
mistake and said, 'Hiya Son.' She said
'I'm a girl.' "
Despite the similarity in hair styles,
boys and girls still ask for traditional
toys, according to the two Santas.
Both mentioned "Baby Alive," a doll
that drinks and wets, as being the most
popular girls' toy. "They must have
done a real advertising job on her,"
says Kubiak. Boys usually ask for war
toys — especially G.I. Joe sets.
'Damn Near Everything'
Occasionally, children can't think
of anything they want when they sit
on Santa's lap. "I had this one kid last
year who invented a toy," said
Kubiak. "He was at a loss for words so
he invented it. I kept asking him what
it was and he went on and on. As near
as I could tell this toy did damn near
everything."
Fewer kids believe in Santa Claus
this year, according to Kubiak. Hines
remembers one six-year-old who
noticed his "fake moustache."
Some kids try to trip up Santa.
"Yesterday I had one little boy ask me
the names of the reindeer," said
Kubiak. "For the first time in my life I

got all nine right. Then he asked me
the names of the reindeer's wives."
About a fourth of the kids are still
afraid of Santa Claus, according to the
two Santas. "A lot of the time 1 think
it's the parents' fault," said Kubiak.
"They keep asking the kid whether
he's going to cry — until he does."
Often parents are really anxious to
get the "picture with Santa" and will
force their children up to Kubiak.
"I've seen the kid get kicked in the
shin to get him up there," says
Vantamelen.
"From age one-and-a-half to
two-and-a-half there's the 'God, what
is this?' reaction," says Hines. "Before
and after that they're 0.K." Both have
talked to children under six weeks old.
Both Santas say that they love their
jobs. Although they remember some
grim parts, like the time a little boy
got his sucker stuck in Kubiak's beard,
they can recall countless wonderful
times. "A week ago I asked a little boy
what he wanted and he said 'world
peace,' " said Kubiak. "I was pretty
impressed and asked if he wanted
anything else. He thought a minute
and then said, 'A machine gun — to
kill all the bad people.' "

his first year at Macy's. He's hired by a
temporary help agency, which rents
him out to department stores and
private parties. The agency provides
him with his $500 costume —
complete with a false wig and a foam
rubber stomach — and pays him $3 an
hour.
During the rest of the year. Hines,
50, works as a foreman in a cannery.
He's spending his one-month vacation
being the Sears Santa.
Although he enjoys his job, he
confides that no one at the cannery
knows what he's doing — "I don't tell
my boss. I'm not too sure why I don't
tell him, but I don't." Hines does not
work through an agency.
At Sears, Santa Claus is a big deal.

"We started the Saturday before
Thanksgiving," Hines recalls. "I heard
on the news that night that Santa was
going to enter Sears."
While working, Hines sits in a
conspicuous display with a draped red
background, a white furry chair and
huge candy canes. He is right next to
the main door, and Santa signs point
him out.
Macy's Santa, on the other hand, is
almost impossible to find. Hidden in
the children's department in a room
filled with old cribs, Kubiak and his
"elf" Jane Vantamelen complain that
people don't notice them.
No Child Molesters
There are relatively few
requirements to play a Santa. At Sears,
Hines needed only a personal
recommendation. The agency,
however, is a little more picky. "You
don't want some people with a high,
squeaky voice which doesn't work for
Santa," Kubiak explains. "And anyone
who's been arrested for child
molesting is sort of out."
Both Kubiak and Hines said that
they have a hard time telling boys
from girls. "A little girl with long hair
said 'Hiya Santa' in a deep voice," said

Kubiak. "1 thought I'd made another
mistake and said, 'Hiya Son.' She said
'I'm a girl.' "
Despite the similarity in hair styles,
boys and girls still ask for traditional
toys, according to the two Santas.
Both mentioned "Baby Alive," a doll
that drinks and wets, as being the most
popular girls' toy. "They must have
done a real advertising job on her,"
says Kubiak. Boys usually ask for war
toys — especially G.I. Joe sets.
'Damn Near Everything'
Occasionally, children can't think
of anything they want when they sit
on Santa's lap. "I had this one kid last
year who invented a toy," said
Kubiak. "He was at a loss for words so
he invented it. I kept asking him what
it was and he went on and on. As near
as I could tell this toy did damn near
everything."
Fewer kids believe in Santa Claus
this year, according to Kubiak. Hines
remembers one six-year-old who
noticed his "fake moustache."
Some kids try to trip up Santa.
"Yesterday I had one little boy ask me
the names of the reindeer," said
Kubiak. "For the first time in my life I

got all nine right. Then he asked me
the names of the reindeer's wives."
About a fourth of the kids are still
afraid of Santa Claus, according to the
two Santas. "A lot of the time 1 think
it's the parents' fault," said Kubiak.
"They keep asking the kid whether
he's going to cry — until he does."
Often parents are really anxious to
get the "picture with Santa" and will
force their children up to Kubiak.
"I've seen the kid get kicked in the
shin to get him up there," says
Vantamelen.
"From age one-and-a-half to
two-and-a-half there's the 'God, what
is this?' reaction," says Hines. "Before
and after that they're 0.K." Both have
talked to children under six weeks old.
Both Santas say that they love their
jobs. Although they remember some
grim parts, like the time a little boy
got his sucker stuck in Kubiak's beard,
they can recall countless wonderful
times. "A week ago I asked a little boy
what he wanted and he said 'world
peace,' " said Kubiak. "I was pretty
impressed and asked if he wanted
anything else. He thought a minute
and then said, 'A machine gun — to
kill all the bad people.' "

SUFFERIN' SANTA — The übiquitous Santa Claus dispenses goodies to one of
his avid fans at a local department store. Santa is expected to remain in the area
for another few weeks, before heading for his retreat at the North Pole.
It's pretty hard to keep a kid
believing in Santa Claus any more. But
for one month a year, Don Hines and
Milton Kubiak make that their job.
Any child who talks to them will leave
fairly sure, if not certain, that Santa
Claus is alive and well and living at
Sears or Macy's.
Kubiak, a 25-year-old math major
at San Jose State, has doubled as Santa
Claus for two years, although this is
his first year at Macy's. He's hired by a
temporary help agency, which rents
him out to department stores and
private parties. The agency provides
