# Stanford Invitational
## USC Swimmers Weather Storm 
### STEVE BAKER 
In weather that at times
seemed more fitting for a trip
around Cape Horn than for a
swim meet, Stanford opened its
swim season last weekend with
the Stanford Invitational.
The performances of coach
Gaughran's swimmers can only be
described as encouraging for some
and not quite as encouraging for
others. Nevertheless, it was a good
indication of what sort of shape
they're in.
Although California, Pacific,
and Foothill Aquatic Club were
there too, USC and Stanford
grossly overshadowed them. And
as expected, USC dominated the
stormy encounter, winning nine
of 16 events. Southern Cal, with
incredible depth, has perhaps the
best chance of anyone to overtake
six-time NCAA Champion
Indiana.
In the 400-yard individual

medley, the top four finishers
were Trojans, as were the top two
finishers in the 200-yard freestyle
and the 100-yard butterfly.
Freshman John Naber was a triple
winner for the Trojans, taking the
200-yard backstroke, the
500-yard freestyle and the
1650-yard freestyle in times of
1:58.8, 4:42.2 ' and 16:36.6,
respectively.
Stanford showed some bright
spots of its own during the cloud>
weekend, led of course, by
sophomore John Hencken, the
meet's only other triple winner.
After winning the 200-yard
individual medley in the rain on
Friday, Hencken walked away
with the 100 and 200-yard
breastroke Saturday. His 200-yard
breastroke time of 2:06.7 was
more than seven seconds ahead of
second place.
There were other strong
performances by the Cards. Steve

Strong and Terry Sutton turned in
some good early season times in
the 500 and 1650. In the sprints
Bruce Goodwin and Dave
Fairbank were one-two in the
100-yard free and combined with
Dean Anderson and Martin Pedley
to take the sprint relay easily over
USC in a great time of 3:09.6.
Now the swimmers start heavy
training in preparation for the
dual meet season beginning
January. After voting down the
annual trip to Hawaii, they plan
to work out through Christmas
vacation. This is the time when
the dual meets of winter quarter
are won or lost — how tough the
swimmers get over the next few
weeks will determine their 1974
success.

respectively.
Stanford showed some bright
spots of its own during the cloud>
weekend, led of course, by
sophomore John Hencken, the
meet's only other triple winner.
After winning the 200-yard
individual medley in the rain on
Friday, Hencken walked away
with the 100 and 200-yard
breastroke Saturday. His 200-yard
breastroke time of 2:06.7 was
more than seven seconds ahead of
second place.
There were other strong
performances by the Cards. Steve

Strong and Terry Sutton turned in
some good early season times in
the 500 and 1650. In the sprints
Bruce Goodwin and Dave
Fairbank were one-two in the
100-yard free and combined with
Dean Anderson and Martin Pedley
to take the sprint relay easily over
USC in a great time of 3:09.6.
Now the swimmers start heavy
training in preparation for the
dual meet season beginning
January. After voting down the
annual trip to Hawaii, they plan
to work out through Christmas
vacation. This is the time when
the dual meets of winter quarter
are won or lost — how tough the
swimmers get over the next few
weeks will determine their 1974
success.
In weather that at times
seemed more fitting for a trip
around Cape Horn than for a
swim meet, Stanford opened its
swim season last weekend with
the Stanford Invitational.
The performances of coach
Gaughran's swimmers can only be
described as encouraging for some
and not quite as encouraging for
others. Nevertheless, it was a good
indication of what sort of shape
they're in.
Although California, Pacific,
and Foothill Aquatic Club were
there too, USC and Stanford
grossly overshadowed them. And
as expected, USC dominated the
stormy encounter, winning nine
of 16 events. Southern Cal, with
incredible depth, has perhaps the
best chance of anyone to overtake
six-time NCAA Champion
Indiana.
In the 400-yard individual

medley, the top four finishers
were Trojans, as were the top two
finishers in the 200-yard freestyle
and the 100-yard butterfly.
Freshman John Naber was a triple
winner for the Trojans, taking the
200-yard backstroke, the
500-yard freestyle and the
1650-yard freestyle in times of
1:58.8, 4:42.2 ' and 16:36.6,
respectively.
