# Alums Fall In IM Thriller
## Hornets Win Women's Title 
### STAN WILSON 
It was everything it had been
billed to be — the battle of the
century; a titanic; Stanford's own
civil war. And when the smoke
had cleared and the tears had
dried, the Guthrie Hornets had
outlasted the Guthrie Alums in
overtime for a 30-18 victory to
capture the Women's Intramural
flag football championship.
A cheering, jeering,
standing-room-only Sunday
afternoon crowd witnessed what
has to be one of the most exciting
football games in Stanford
gridiron history, as the Hornets
scored twice in overtime to stave
off the Alums' comeback bid.
In the end it was the Hornets'
relentless three yards-and-a-cloud
of-dust ground attack which
proved superior to the Alums'
vaunted aerial assault. Hornet
quarterback Marianne Hallisey
enjoyed one of the finest
afternoons of her career as she ran
for three touchdowns, passed for
another and returned an
interception for a fourth TD in
overtime — a play which proved
to be the turning point in the
game.
The Hornets opened the
scoring on a 47-yard touchdown
run by Hallisey early in the game.
After an exchange of possessions,
Guthrie scored again on a bomb
from Hallisey to wide receiver
Terry Brown, one of Hallisey's
few passes in the game.
The Alums came right back,
driving from their own 20 yard
line, and scored on a seven-yard
pass from quarterback Nancy
Miller to split end Chris Michel
with 7:38 to go in the first half.
But the Hornets countered
with their effective ground game,
and it was Hallisey again this time,
scoring on a 39-yard dash to make
the score 18-16 in the first half,
giving head coaches Dennis
Peterson and Brad Williams,
whom split end Sarah Goodan
said deserved a great deal of credit
for the victory, needed breathing
room.
The second half belonged to
the Alums, as Miller, after an
exchange of possessions, drove her
team to the Hornet five yard line
before leaving the game
temporarily with a sprained ankle.
Lawson ran it over from there,
and when the Alums' failed once
more to score the conversion,
they trailed 18-12 midway

through the second half.
After a brief defensive struggle,
the Alums drove to the Hornet
15, and with only seven seconds
remaining in regulation time,
Miller fired a touchdown pass to
Lawson on an out pattern to tie
the game.
The Alums threatened to take
the lead for the first time in the
game early in the overtime period,
but Hallisey picked off a Miller
pass on the Hornet seven and
returned it 73 yards for the score.
With 1:38 left in the contest
Hallisey added icing to the victory
when she ran for a 24-yard
touchdown to make the final
score 30-18.
