# Season Starts Early For Card Gymnasts
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
A contingent from the
Stanford gymnastics team will get
an early start on the 1974 season
tonight at 8 p.m. on the
Sacramento State Invitational.
Sadao Hamada will begin his
second year as head coach of the
Card gymnasts in the meet, which
features some of the top
competitors from across the state.
"We're going to concentrate on
individual performances in this
meet," Hamada explained. "I
don't even know if they're going
to have team scoring, and it
doesn't make any difference.
We're just going into this meet to
get some competitive experience."
Hamada's list of entries would
seem to justify his claim. He
doesn't plan on taking any of his
all-around men, which include
two-time Olympian and NCAA
champion Steve Hug, who is
spending fall quarter doing
independent study in Japan (Hug
will return in the winter), and
standouts Bob Anderson and Ted
Miyamoto.
"The all-around competitors
need more time to prepare their
routines," said Hamada

fall-around competitors do all six
gymnastics events). Both
Anderson and Miyamoto have also
been plagued by minor injuries, so
a competition for them at this
point would probably do more
harm than good.
The gymnasts Hamada plans to
take to Sacramento are Howard
Bessen, George Negrete, BHI
Madsen, Shawn Skerrett and Ted
Marcy.
Bessen is a senior rings
specialist who two years ago
placed sixth in the NCAA and last
season led the Pac-8 in that event.
Negrete is also strong on the rings
and should provide good depth in
that event with the addition of
the all-around men in the winter.
Madsen is a sophomore whose
speciality is floor exercise. Along
with him in that event is Skerrett,
who is also one of the top vaulters
around, placing second in the
Pac-8 in that event last year.
Marcy completes the Card
squad for the Sacramento meet.
The sophomore from Oak Brook,
111. is one of the premier side
horse artists in the country. He
took the Pac-8 championship last
year and placed fourth in the
NCAA's.
