# Women Swimmers Win League Championship
## 
### MARCY O. KEEFE 
At 2:30 a.m. last Sunday a
busload of tired but happy
swimmers finally returned from
Humboldt State and the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC)
Championships. Finishing off an
undefeated season, the Stanford
women's varsity swim team placed
first in the Championships with a
total score of 304 points.
UC-Davis placed second, trailing
Stanford by 17 points, and
Sacramento State came in third.
"It [the Championships]
proved to be a very satisfying
conclusion to a successful
season," remarked coach Betsy
Weeks. "I think one of the main
reasons we did so well was that
the team worked well together as
a unit."
Out of the 14 events held, the
Cards took three first places, three
seconds, three thirds, four
fourths, two fifths and four
sixths.
Freshman Vickie Hayes
secured two of Stanford's first
place ribbons by winning both the

50-meter and 100-meter
breaststroke events. Setting
NCIAC records in both races,
Hayes swam the 50 in 32.4 and
the 100 in 110.2.
The 400 medley relay team of
Mei Ong, Vickie Hayes, Kathy
Heinze and Vickie King took
Stanford's remaining first place by
clocking 4:25.5 (also an NCIAC
record).
Second place winners included
Kathy Heinze, swimming the
100-meter fly in 1:03.4; the 400
free relay team of Diane Dillon,
Vickie Hayes, Jackie Brink and
Vickie King, clocking 4:02.5; and
the 200 medley relay team of Mei
Ong, Vickie Hayes, Sue Trupin
and Nan Leuschel, covering the
distance in 2:01.5.
New Stanford records were set
by Mei Ong, who swam the
50-meter backstroke in 31.2, and
Nan Leuschel, who clocked 27.0
for the 50 freestyle.
"We were really close with
Davis during the finals," Weeks
said. "In fact no one knew who
had won when all the events were
finished. We had to wait around

for an hour before we finally got
the scores."
Total point scores showed a
definite split between Stanford,
UC-Davis and Sacramento State
and the other schools in the
conference. Stanford's winning
total was 304 points, followed by
UC-Davis with 287 and
Sacramento State with 238. San
Jose State came in fourth with
148.5 points and Hayward placed
fifth with 146.
Five Stanford swimmers
qualified for the Women's
Nationals to be held next March
at Penn State. Ong, Trupin, Brink,
Heinze and Hayes all qualified and
will compete along with
approximately 350 other
swimmers from various schools
across the nation.
Co-captains of this year's team
were Margie Meek and Sandy
Weller. Laurel Treon, a graduate
student and 1972 team member,
acted as manager.
The NCIAC Championships
marked the end of the regular
conference season, but Weeks
welcomes all old team members
and any interested to participate
in a winter swimming program,
designed to prepare those who
qualify for the Nationals. A few
invitational meets involving some
of the schools in the Northern
California Conference will also be
held during winter quarter.

Out of the 14 events held, the
Cards took three first places, three
seconds, three thirds, four
fourths, two fifths and four
sixths.
Freshman Vickie Hayes
secured two of Stanford's first
place ribbons by winning both the

50-meter and 100-meter
breaststroke events. Setting
NCIAC records in both races,
Hayes swam the 50 in 32.4 and
the 100 in 110.2.
The 400 medley relay team of
Mei Ong, Vickie Hayes, Kathy
Heinze and Vickie King took
Stanford's remaining first place by
clocking 4:25.5 (also an NCIAC
record).
Second place winners included
Kathy Heinze, swimming the
100-meter fly in 1:03.4; the 400
free relay team of Diane Dillon,
Vickie Hayes, Jackie Brink and
Vickie King, clocking 4:02.5; and
the 200 medley relay team of Mei
Ong, Vickie Hayes, Sue Trupin
and Nan Leuschel, covering the
distance in 2:01.5.
New Stanford records were set
by Mei Ong, who swam the
50-meter backstroke in 31.2, and
Nan Leuschel, who clocked 27.0
for the 50 freestyle.
"We were really close with
Davis during the finals," Weeks
said. "In fact no one knew who
had won when all the events were
finished. We had to wait around

for an hour before we finally got
the scores."
Total point scores showed a
definite split between Stanford,
UC-Davis and Sacramento State
and the other schools in the
conference. Stanford's winning
total was 304 points, followed by
UC-Davis with 287 and
Sacramento State with 238. San
Jose State came in fourth with
148.5 points and Hayward placed
fifth with 146.
Five Stanford swimmers
qualified for the Women's
Nationals to be held next March
at Penn State. Ong, Trupin, Brink,
Heinze and Hayes all qualified and
will compete along with
approximately 350 other
swimmers from various schools
across the nation.
Co-captains of this year's team
were Margie Meek and Sandy
Weller. Laurel Treon, a graduate
student and 1972 team member,
acted as manager.
The NCIAC Championships
marked the end of the regular
conference season, but Weeks
welcomes all old team members
and any interested to participate
in a winter swimming program,
designed to prepare those who
qualify for the Nationals. A few
invitational meets involving some
of the schools in the Northern
California Conference will also be
held during winter quarter.
