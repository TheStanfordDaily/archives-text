# Players ’ Spirits High
## Party Atmosphere At Rugby Tourney 
### CHRIS BAKER 
"What the hell is this?" asked
the bewildered onlooker. "I came
to buy tickets for the USF
basketball game and it looks like
it's still Big Game from the
tailgating going on over there."
No, he wasn't seeing the
onslaught of motorists before the
Stanford-Cal extravaganza — he
was witnessing the players in the
Stanford 10-a-side rugby
tournament held last Saturday.
But the observations of this
onlooker weren't totally wrong,
for a plethora of vehicles running
the gambit from custom trailers to
old World War 2 ambulances
crowded the road in front of
Harry Maloney Field. The vehicles
were full of rugby players
psyching themselves up for their
next contest with the aid of such

tested thirst quenchers as Country
Club and Jim Beam.
There were rugby games in
progress on all of the available
fields in the annual kickoff of the
Northern California rugby season.
This was supposed to be a
10-a-side tournament but some
teams were helped by furry
four-legged auxiliary members
who roamed onto the fields. The
sidelines were filled with players
taking a rest from the action, glass
of ale in hand.
Midnight Greeting
Their teammates were engaging
in something which resembled a
midnight greeting in Central Park,
with everyone trying to get an
oversized football. When a player
did get possession of the ball he
headed for the goal line, using an
offense that made Pepper

Rodgers' Wishbone look like an
infringement of a patent.
When players scored they
actually did touch the ball down.
The extra point in the game was
simplified, for the kicker was
permitted to perform without
being hurried by a rush.
Woody Hayes would have had
a fit, for the officials on the
sidelines occasionally took breaks
while the game was going on,
handing over their duties to
spectators. The public address
system periodically asked for
volunteers to referee contests.
Undaunted by these flaws, play
continued. Players dressed in
everything from shirts with bats
on them to jailshirts. One wonders
what would have happened if the
BATS (Bay Area Touring Side)
had brought their mascot with
them.
Familiar Faces
Stanford's rugby team was one
of the participants in this event.
The team had such familiar names
as Craig Zaltosky, Eric Test and
Gordy Riegel. The Cards managed
to win two of the three games in
the freestyle tourney.
Stanford defeated San Jose
State and Monterey Rugby Club
before losing to BATS, 12-7. This
gave the Cards a third place finish
in their division.. It was a
combination of Mr. Z and Test
which led the Cards during all the
games.
But even though the Stanford
Cards lost the tournament, the
Stanford Redbirds won the event.

The Redbirds, a team of Stanford
Alumni that included Don Bunce
and Jack Schultz, defeated BATS
8-4 in the championship game.
"This was pretty much a
one-shot deal," said Bunce. "A
bunch of us just decided to get
together and have some fun."
Indeed the event was fun for
winner and loser alike. The real
competition came after the
tournament was over, as the
players gathered around six kegs.
