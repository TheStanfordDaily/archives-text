## Theta Delts Lead 
### PETE BHATIA 
Fall Quarter intramurals are
completed and the Theta Delts are
in their customary first place
position in the point standings.
The Theta Delts scored 273'/2
points, a new autumn quarter
record, easily outdistancing
runnerup Biz I, who carded 212.
The previous autumn quarter
record was 183 points, set by the
1968 Theat Delts.
The Axe thieves scored at least
10 points in each of the eight fall
events, including 85 points in
two-player volleyball, 58 in
football, 50 in free throws and 30
in golf.
The only championship the
Theta Delts won in the quarter
was two-player vollej ball, where
Jim lams and Steve Hoch teamed
to win the title, which was worth
60 points. lams and Hoch didn't
lose a game in the entire quarter
of competition, topped off by an
11-7, 11-8 victory over Shakey's
in the finals.
Rounding out the top 10 point
scorers for fall were Biz I with
212, followed by the Zetes with
185 and the DU's with 174'/2. The
Zetes won both "A" and "B"
football while Biz I won free
throws. Fifth place went to El
Toro with 157 followed by JRA
(138), SAE (117), Shakey's (108),
Phi Delts (90) and Biz II (88). The
top dorm in the point standings is

Adclfa, in eleventh place with 87
points.
To recap the individual sports
winners, the Culos, with Rich
Cortez and Bill Uhle, won the golf
championship with a 1-up victory
on the 25th hole over DU's Mark
and Mike Mcßride. The match was
a very strange one, as both teams
consistently missed short birdie
putts and made miraculous
30-footers. The victory earned the
Culos 50 IM points.
In tennis, the 143-team
tourney amazingly was finished in
time for dead week with McSears
topping DU in the final 6-1, 6-2.
McSears was scheduled to play
Econometrica in the finals, until
some astute individual noticed
that one of the Econometrica
players was a former captain of
the Stanford varsity tennis team,
clearly in violation of IM rules.
McSears earned 65 IM points for
the tennis win and is in 15th
position in the fall quarter
standings.
In billiards, Cro Mem took the
title with a resounding victory
over SAE, earning 35 IM points
with the victory.
In "B" volleyball, the Zetes,
led by former high school
All-American Craig Johnson, won
the title and 20 IM points with an
11-9, 11-9 over the Nooners,
whose top player is Stanford
professor Vahe Petrosian. It was
the third title won by the Zetes in
the quarter and their 185 points
surpasses their entire 1972-73
total.
