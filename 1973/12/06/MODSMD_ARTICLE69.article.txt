Rain and mud forced an early
ending at the Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) field hockey
championships last weekend in
Hay ward, but Stanford emerged
from the shortened tourney as the
only undefeated team in Northern
California.
The eight-team women's
tournament was cancelled after
the second round because of the
sloppy conditions. Stanford, after
defeating Sacramento State 3-0 in
the first round and recording a 2-0
victory over UC-Davis in second
round play, was scheduled to
meet Chico State in the finals.
That game never materialized,
however, and the Cards were
forced to accept the unofficial

conference championship on the
basis of their regular season and
tournament records. "We were the
only team in Northern California
to finish the season undefeated in
both regular season and
tournament play," said pleased
coach Shirley Schoof.
The varsity concluded its
season with a 7-0-1 record. Junior
Marina Ballyntine, who scored all
three goals in the tournament
victory over Sacramento, was the
team's leading scorer, while
freshman Kathy Levinson finished
second on the varsity scoring
charts.
Ann Walker, meanwhile,
averaged nearly two goals per
game to lead the junior varsity to
a 4-3-1 season.
