# Department Rules Stifle Creativity
## Scholars Need Freedom To Explore 
### 
It is with hesitation, but not
without hope, that I respond to
inquiry about university reform.
Many years ago, when the word
ombudsman was unknown in the
English language, I explained in a
faculty meeting the role of such
an individual and the service he
could provide in settling
individual problems at Stanford.
The suggestion was greeted with
incredulity and general laughter,
but we have an ombudsman, and a
good one, too.
Some time later I said that it
was unhealthy to have simply a
university administration and a
captive audience named the
Academic Council, and that a
university senate was necessary to
bridge the gap. A minor
administrator denounced me
furiously for not believing that all
was for the best in the best of all
possible worlds, but the Senate
came into being.
While I therefore have reason
to hope, one may wonder why I
am willing to express unwelcome
opinions once more. Firstly, I am
convinced that the American
university is in some degree
responsible for the international
plight of this country, and
secondly there are a number of
faculty members who feel like
lions with their tails caught in a
mouse-trap.
I grew up in a world like that
of John Caspar Branner in which
the curious mind wandered freely
but cautiously, thinking nothing
alien. We now find ourselves
trapped in an Alcatraz of
departments, each with its jargon
and power politics. The wardens
may find this the best way to
establish some kind of order, but
is it the best for the bird-men in
the cells? It is convenient to
assume that the cosmos may
neatly be divided according to
departments, but in fact this is
not so; the most significant
research is taking place in fields
which do not correspond to our
departmental pattern.
Creativity Stifled
The departments sometimes
fall into the clutches of a
chairman and his cohorts, who
impose their concepts with no
regard for other, and often more
creative members of the
department. This is the road to
sterility. We read that X is highly
competent in his field, but he is
unqualified to speak outside of it,
even if he has a first-class mind
and has devoted years to his later
interest.
Scholars are apparently
expected to stick to the field to
which they devoted a few years in
their early twenties. In fact,
creative minds do not operate
thus. Often the most creative
work is done by a scholar who
moves in from another field, free
from the stifling conventions of
those who grew up in it. Roscoe
Pound studied biology and never
took a law course in his life, but
he became the leading authority
on the Common Law and dean of
the Harvard Law School.
Inadequate Reforms
The reforms invented to date
have not been satisfactory.
Interdepartmental committees can
become as tyrannical as
departments. "University
professors" have been appointed
in some universities, but they have
little more than a label and they
are not numerous. Stanford has
adopted a strange system by
which professors are given
appointments in several
departments according to some
mathematical formula, but the
professor normally operates only
in one department.
Graduate special courses and
even undergraduate special
courses have adopted inquisitorial
methods which may be necessary
to meet possible departmental

criticism but which a
self-respecting senior professor
cannot accept. One solution has
been the team approach, and this
can be excellent, but it does not
answer the problem of the
individual scholar. Professor
Raymond Williams recently
remarked: "A different
intellectual tradition — now
vigorously developing in Western
Europe and among younger
intellectuals in the United States
and Britain — attempts general
analysis, as opposed to the
aggregation of specializations
which is our institutionalized
method."
In brief, the creative and
serious scholar should be free to
wander where his research takes
him. We might follow with
modifications the system of the
College de France, in which there
are no departments, and chairs are
named to suit the interest of the
individual.
How can one say that the
American university is in some
degree responsible for the
international plight of this
country? The departmental

system has led to the dilemma
that few of our language faculty
have an adequate understanding
of anything outside the field of
belles lettres, while our behavioral
scientists often have an
inadequate knowledge of the
language and civilization of the
countries about which they were
giving advice. I shuddered when I
saw some behavioral scientists
going to Vietnam, armed with
little more than their theories and
their jargon, to prepare a report
which might have a decisive
influence on the lives of millions
of people.
Stanford established a
geography department when the
government said it would not
grant funds for area studies unless
there were such a department, and
it abolished the department when
the behavioral approach, which
the Ford Foundation supported,
made geography seem expendable.
As a result of this decision
(against which I protested with
unwelcome and useless vigor), a
lack of geographical sense is
evident in all our international
studies. The arguments to prove

Ronald Hilton

that geography does not exist can
easily be used to prove that
history does not exist. Some time
ago while addressing a group of
students on the Malta problem,
then the flashpoint of
international tensions, it occurred
to me to ask where Malta was. No
one knew.
International studies requires a
careful analysis of a vast
multitude of data. Our activists
are usually dismally uninformed,
and all our students should read
more; the only common
denominator seems to be someone
called Jeanne Dixon. The facts
must be analyzed in a critical way.
The debate has been replaced by
the teach-in and the White Plaza
harangue, or the Memorial Church
meeting (Gott mit uns) in which
the bourdon is thanks for our not
being made like the sinners we
denounce. As serious analysis all
this is rather silly, and indeed it is
not convincing or effective. This is
not a question of being a leftist or
a rightist; it is a question of
understanding what a university
is.

came into being.
While I therefore have reason
to hope, one may wonder why I
am willing to express unwelcome
opinions once more. Firstly, I am
convinced that the American
university is in some degree
responsible for the international
plight of this country, and
secondly there are a number of
faculty members who feel like
lions with their tails caught in a
mouse-trap.
I grew up in a world like that
of John Caspar Branner in which
the curious mind wandered freely
but cautiously, thinking nothing
alien. We now find ourselves
trapped in an Alcatraz of
departments, each with its jargon
and power politics. The wardens
may find this the best way to
establish some kind of order, but
is it the best for the bird-men in
the cells? It is convenient to
assume that the cosmos may
neatly be divided according to
departments, but in fact this is
not so; the most significant
research is taking place in fields
which do not correspond to our
departmental pattern.
Creativity Stifled
The departments sometimes
fall into the clutches of a
chairman and his cohorts, who
impose their concepts with no
regard for other, and often more
creative members of the
department. This is the road to
sterility. We read that X is highly
competent in his field, but he is
unqualified to speak outside of it,
even if he has a first-class mind
and has devoted years to his later
interest.
Scholars are apparently
expected to stick to the field to
which they devoted a few years in
their early twenties. In fact,
creative minds do not operate
thus. Often the most creative
work is done by a scholar who
moves in from another field, free
from the stifling conventions of
those who grew up in it. Roscoe
Pound studied biology and never
took a law course in his life, but
he became the leading authority
on the Common Law and dean of
the Harvard Law School.
Inadequate Reforms
The reforms invented to date
have not been satisfactory.
Interdepartmental committees can
become as tyrannical as
departments. "University
professors" have been appointed
in some universities, but they have
little more than a label and they
are not numerous. Stanford has
adopted a strange system by
which professors are given
appointments in several
departments according to some
mathematical formula, but the
professor normally operates only
in one department.
Graduate special courses and
even undergraduate special
courses have adopted inquisitorial
methods which may be necessary
to meet possible departmental

criticism but which a
self-respecting senior professor
cannot accept. One solution has
been the team approach, and this
can be excellent, but it does not
answer the problem of the
individual scholar. Professor
Raymond Williams recently
remarked: "A different
intellectual tradition — now
vigorously developing in Western
Europe and among younger
intellectuals in the United States
and Britain — attempts general
analysis, as opposed to the
aggregation of specializations
which is our institutionalized
method."
In brief, the creative and
serious scholar should be free to
wander where his research takes
him. We might follow with
modifications the system of the
College de France, in which there
are no departments, and chairs are
named to suit the interest of the
individual.
How can one say that the
American university is in some
degree responsible for the
international plight of this
country? The departmental

system has led to the dilemma
that few of our language faculty
have an adequate understanding
of anything outside the field of
belles lettres, while our behavioral
scientists often have an
inadequate knowledge of the
language and civilization of the
countries about which they were
giving advice. I shuddered when I
saw some behavioral scientists
going to Vietnam, armed with
little more than their theories and
their jargon, to prepare a report
which might have a decisive
influence on the lives of millions
of people.
Stanford established a
geography department when the
government said it would not
grant funds for area studies unless
there were such a department, and
it abolished the department when
the behavioral approach, which
the Ford Foundation supported,
made geography seem expendable.
As a result of this decision
(against which I protested with
unwelcome and useless vigor), a
lack of geographical sense is
evident in all our international
studies. The arguments to prove

Ronald Hilton

that geography does not exist can
easily be used to prove that
history does not exist. Some time
ago while addressing a group of
students on the Malta problem,
then the flashpoint of
international tensions, it occurred
to me to ask where Malta was. No
one knew.
International studies requires a
careful analysis of a vast
multitude of data. Our activists
are usually dismally uninformed,
and all our students should read
more; the only common
denominator seems to be someone
called Jeanne Dixon. The facts
must be analyzed in a critical way.
The debate has been replaced by
the teach-in and the White Plaza
harangue, or the Memorial Church
meeting (Gott mit uns) in which
the bourdon is thanks for our not
being made like the sinners we
denounce. As serious analysis all
this is rather silly, and indeed it is
not convincing or effective. This is
not a question of being a leftist or
a rightist; it is a question of
understanding what a university
is.

'OUR PRESIDENT HAS HIS ECCENTRICITIES—HE THROWS OUT THE GOOD STUFF AND KEEPS
THE GARBAGE INSIDE!'
It is with hesitation, but not
without hope, that I respond to
inquiry about university reform.
Many years ago, when the word
ombudsman was unknown in the
English language, I explained in a
faculty meeting the role of such
an individual and the service he
could provide in settling
individual problems at Stanford.
The suggestion was greeted with
incredulity and general laughter,
but we have an ombudsman, and a
good one, too.
Some time later I said that it
was unhealthy to have simply a
university administration and a
captive audience named the
Academic Council, and that a
university senate was necessary to
bridge the gap. A minor
administrator denounced me
furiously for not believing that all
was for the best in the best of all

the cells? It is convenient to
assume that the cosmos may
neatly be divided according to
departments, but in fact this is
not so; the most significant
research is taking place in fields
which do not correspond to our
departmental pattern.
Creativity Stifled
The departments sometimes
fall into the clutches of a
chairman and his cohorts, who
impose their concepts with no
regard for other, and often more
creative members of the
department. This is the road to
sterility. We read that X is highly
competent in his field, but he is
unqualified to speak outside of it,
even if he has a first-class mind
and has devoted years to his later
interest.
Scholars are apparently
expected to stick to the field to
which they devoted a few years in
their early twenties. In fact,
creative minds do not operate
thus. Often the most creative
work is done by a scholar who
moves in from another field, free
from the stifling conventions of
those who grew up in it. Roscoe
Pound studied biology and never
took a law course in his life, but
he became the leading authority
on the Common Law and dean of
the Harvard Law School.
Inadequate Reforms
The reforms invented to date
have not been satisfactory.
Interdepartmental committees can
become as tyrannical as
departments. "University
professors" have been appointed
in some universities, but they have
little more than a label and they
are not numerous. Stanford has
adopted a strange system by
which professors are given
appointments in several
departments according to some
mathematical formula, but the
professor normally operates only
in one department.
Graduate special courses and
even undergraduate special
courses have adopted inquisitorial
methods which may be necessary
to meet possible departmental

criticism but which a
self-respecting senior professor
cannot accept. One solution has
been the team approach, and this
can be excellent, but it does not
answer the problem of the
individual scholar. Professor
Raymond Williams recently
remarked: "A different
intellectual tradition — now
vigorously developing in Western
Europe and among younger
intellectuals in the United States
and Britain — attempts general
analysis, as opposed to the
aggregation of specializations
which is our institutionalized
method."
In brief, the creative and
serious scholar should be free to
wander where his research takes
him. We might follow with
modifications the system of the
College de France, in which there
are no departments, and chairs are
named to suit the interest of the
individual.
How can one say that the
American university is in some
degree responsible for the
international plight of this
country? The departmental

system has led to the dilemma
that few of our language faculty
have an adequate understanding
of anything outside the field of
belles lettres, while our behavioral
scientists often have an
inadequate knowledge of the
language and civilization of the
countries about which they were
giving advice. I shuddered when I
saw some behavioral scientists
going to Vietnam, armed with
little more than their theories and
their jargon, to prepare a report
which might have a decisive
influence on the lives of millions
of people.
Stanford established a
geography department when the
government said it would not
grant funds for area studies unless
there were such a department, and
it abolished the department when
the behavioral approach, which
the Ford Foundation supported,
made geography seem expendable.
As a result of this decision
(against which I protested with
unwelcome and useless vigor), a
lack of geographical sense is
evident in all our international
studies. The arguments to prove

Ronald Hilton

that geography does not exist can
easily be used to prove that
history does not exist. Some time
ago while addressing a group of
students on the Malta problem,
then the flashpoint of
international tensions, it occurred
to me to ask where Malta was. No
one knew.
International studies requires a
careful analysis of a vast
multitude of data. Our activists
are usually dismally uninformed,
and all our students should read
more; the only common
denominator seems to be someone
called Jeanne Dixon. The facts
must be analyzed in a critical way.
The debate has been replaced by
the teach-in and the White Plaza
harangue, or the Memorial Church
meeting (Gott mit uns) in which
the bourdon is thanks for our not
being made like the sinners we
denounce. As serious analysis all
this is rather silly, and indeed it is
not convincing or effective. This is
not a question of being a leftist or
a rightist; it is a question of
understanding what a university
is.

'OUR PRESIDENT HAS HIS ECCENTRICITIES—HE THROWS OUT THE GOOD STUFF AND KEEPS
THE GARBAGE INSIDE!'
It is with hesitation, but not
without hope, that I respond to
inquiry about university reform.
Many years ago, when the word
ombudsman was unknown in the
English language, I explained in a
faculty meeting the role of such
an individual and the service he
could provide in settling
individual problems at Stanford.
The suggestion was greeted with
incredulity and general laughter,
but we have an ombudsman, and a
good one, too.
Some time later I said that it
was unhealthy to have simply a
university administration and a
captive audience named the
Academic Council, and that a
university senate was necessary to
bridge the gap. A minor
administrator denounced me
furiously for not believing that all
was for the best in the best of all
possible worlds, but the Senate
came into being.
While I therefore have reason
to hope, one may wonder why I
am willing to express unwelcome
opinions once more. Firstly, I am
convinced that the American
university is in some degree
responsible for the international
plight of this country, and
secondly there are a number of
faculty members who feel like
lions with their tails caught in a
mouse-trap.
I grew up in a world like that
of John Caspar Branner in which
the curious mind wandered freely
but cautiously, thinking nothing
alien. We now find ourselves
trapped in an Alcatraz of
departments, each with its jargon
and power politics. The wardens
may find this the best way to
establish some kind of order, but
is it the best for the bird-men in
the cells? It is convenient to
