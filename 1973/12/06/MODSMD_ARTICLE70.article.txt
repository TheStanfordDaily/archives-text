# Energetic Coaches Revitalize Club Teams
## Steenbakkers Brings Stability To Sailors 
### TOM WINOKUR 
The day Joe Ruetz screams "Starboard!" out his driver side
window and rushes through a busy intersection, Wim Steenbakkers
will sit back in his chair and smile a satisfied smile.
Wim (pronounced Vim) is the new Stanford sailing coach. As a
matter of fact, he is the first Stanford sailing coach ever and one of his
primary goals is to awaken the athletic department to the sport of
sailing.
Steenbakkers is from Holland, where people take their sailing
seriously. It's the national sport there and is treated with the kind of
respect that basketball and football receive here. Wim was trained in
an extensive Dutch Junior sailing program and graduated into the
European international circuit. After sailing for several years in
intense competition, he returned to Holland to coach other sailors,
most notably the Dutch Olympic team.
Obviously, Wim is one of the few club sport coaches around with
Olympic coaching experience and the obvious question is: How did he
come to be the Stanford sailing coach?
Sailing Consultant
The odyssey began when he married his wifi, Susan, a swimmer
from Santa Clara Swim Club. After arriving here, Wim worked as a
sailing consultant and instructor in the Folsom area. By some obscure
turn of events he was introduced to Stanford athletic director Joe
Ruetz and Ruetz introduced him to some members of the Stanford
Sailing Association. It was a match made in heaven and the sailing
club hired Wim as a maintenance man coordinator. The sailing team
claimed him as coach a short time later.
Despite his youthful, bearded looks, Wim has managed to provide a
stabilizing influence for the team and to centralize many of the
administrative chores of the sailing club. Both the team and club
appreciate Wim's efficiency and seemingly unlimited energy. Although
he was hired for only 20 hours a week, he puts in considerable
amounts of time above and beyond the call of duty.
One of Wim's first coups here at Stanford was the acquisition of a
fall practice site for the team. In past years the team has been forced
to trailor boats to Redwood City for practices. Wim managed to
convince the concessionaire at Searsville Lake to allow Stanford to
keep boats at the lake as long as Lake Lag was empty.
California Leaders
Wim's presence has also allowed Stanford to take a leading role in
California sailing. Earlier this year Wim and Craig Daniels were elected
to the executive committee of PCIYRA, the collegiate sailing
organization in California.
One of the longer term goals made possible by having a coach is a
large fund drive which will allow the club to maintain itself at a
slightly higher level with regard to boats and equipment and will allow
the team to travel more. To accomplish this goal Wim has already
sorted through more than a thousand old membership cards and
convinced his wife to alphabetize them.
One of Wim's long-term personal goals involves the establishment
of an intercollegiate sailing center at Half Moon Bay. The center is
already in the planning stage and several Bay Area sailing enthusiasts
are involved in the idea.
The training center would presumably be similar to the sailing
centers in Europe, where promising young sailors are supplied with
sophisticated boats and first-rate coaching. Such a center would go a
long way toward improving competitive sailing in the United States.
While waiting for this plan to materialize, Wim will continue to
coach here at Stanford and this winter he will teach beginning sailing
classes on Lake Lag. He'll also, of course, be working on Joe Ruetz'
nautical vocabulary.
