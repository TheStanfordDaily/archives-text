# Pat Baldwin Directs Hangloose Icemen
## 
### QUIGLEY S. PETERSON 
A freshman is leafing through his winter quarter time schedule and,
since he needs another unit, takes a gander at Physical Education for
Men. Under By Arrangement he comes across P.E. 1100 — Ice
Hockey. "You've got to be kidding," he says to himself.
Well, it's for real. Even though there was no mention of them in a
recent Daily outlook for winter sports, Stanford's ice hockey team is
alive and kicking. The Cards wound up fall quarter with a 5-4-2 record
and their season will extend through the first week of April.
The team is selected from members of the Stanford Ice Hockey
Club. The club exists for anyone willing to come out and skate on
Sunday nights from 10:30 p.m. until 11:45 p.m. In addition to
skating, the club gets together for things like beer and hamburgers
after a football game.
Being an ice hockey player is not like playing for any other athletic
team here at Stanford, varsity or club. The band does not come to any
games. There are no cheerleaders, female coxwains or managers.
Although the team receives an annual stipend from the athletic
department, team members still have to pay for ice time
($l5/quarter), sticks (4-6/ quarter, at $5 each) and skate sharpening
every 10 days. Besides Sunday night, the team also works out
Thursday at 11 a.m.
So why do they play? Ask any one of them and he'll no doubt
leave the impression that he enjoys it. They all played in high school,
and graduate student Tom Heckler even played in college. As 33
year-old player-coach Pat Baldwin put it, "When you've been playing
since you were five, it's hard to quit, even in California."
But there is more to it than that. Ereshman Danny Schley
remarked, "Having a few beers with the coach and the fans after a
game is a real trip. That's not how we did it in prep school."
Another incentive is weekend road trips. This year, the team has
traveled to Sacramento and Squaw Valley. In the past, the icemen
have been to Las Vegas, Colorado Springs and Eresno.
Last Saturday I had a talk with Baldwin at the Rats about Stanford
ice hockey and what it means to him. Pat played for the Dutch
national team in 1968 after playing four years at Michigan State. Now
he sells computers and works as a marshall at the golf course on the
side.
Pat got started coaching for Stanford five years ago. "A guy I
coached in junior hockey in Michigan told me Stanford had a
program. I started playing with them, and halfway through the season
I was asked to be player-coach."
This year Pat had intended to coach from the bench "because it's
easier to just coach than play and coach." Injuries, however, forced
him out of retirement and he played in all but three games fall
quarter.
Pat is not salaried but his reasons for coaching (and playing)
involve more than love of the game. "Hockey's been good to me," he
says."It put me through high school in Toronto and then Michigan
State." He figures he owes something to the game, so "as long as I can
help these guys improve, I'll stay out there."
There is a more personal side to how Stanford has affected Pat
Baldwin. Referring to current student attitudes toward politics, dope,
etc., he said, "Getting to know the guys off the ice has made me
aware of a lot of things I wouldn't have been aware of." He added
that it "has helped me a lot in business — I'm not as narrow-minded. I
can realize that there are a lot more things in life than money."
Sound like a computer salesman? Not really. One thing Pat forgot
to mention, though, was how he has helped Stanford's ice hockey
program grow to what it is today. But that's like him.
If you want to see a coach who can relate to and command the
respect of his players in an unusual light, just stop by the Rats some
Tuesday night after a game and see Pat in action. He's number 11 in
the red jersey.

Well, it's for real. Even though there was no mention of them in a
recent Daily outlook for winter sports, Stanford's ice hockey team is
alive and kicking. The Cards wound up fall quarter with a 5-4-2 record
and their season will extend through the first week of April.
The team is selected from members of the Stanford Ice Hockey
Club. The club exists for anyone willing to come out and skate on
Sunday nights from 10:30 p.m. until 11:45 p.m. In addition to
skating, the club gets together for things like beer and hamburgers
after a football game.
Being an ice hockey player is not like playing for any other athletic
team here at Stanford, varsity or club. The band does not come to any
games. There are no cheerleaders, female coxwains or managers.
Although the team receives an annual stipend from the athletic
department, team members still have to pay for ice time
($l5/quarter), sticks (4-6/ quarter, at $5 each) and skate sharpening
every 10 days. Besides Sunday night, the team also works out
Thursday at 11 a.m.
So why do they play? Ask any one of them and he'll no doubt
leave the impression that he enjoys it. They all played in high school,
and graduate student Tom Heckler even played in college. As 33
year-old player-coach Pat Baldwin put it, "When you've been playing
since you were five, it's hard to quit, even in California."
But there is more to it than that. Ereshman Danny Schley
remarked, "Having a few beers with the coach and the fans after a
game is a real trip. That's not how we did it in prep school."
Another incentive is weekend road trips. This year, the team has
traveled to Sacramento and Squaw Valley. In the past, the icemen
have been to Las Vegas, Colorado Springs and Eresno.
Last Saturday I had a talk with Baldwin at the Rats about Stanford
ice hockey and what it means to him. Pat played for the Dutch
national team in 1968 after playing four years at Michigan State. Now
he sells computers and works as a marshall at the golf course on the
side.
Pat got started coaching for Stanford five years ago. "A guy I
coached in junior hockey in Michigan told me Stanford had a
program. I started playing with them, and halfway through the season
I was asked to be player-coach."
This year Pat had intended to coach from the bench "because it's
easier to just coach than play and coach." Injuries, however, forced
him out of retirement and he played in all but three games fall
quarter.
Pat is not salaried but his reasons for coaching (and playing)
involve more than love of the game. "Hockey's been good to me," he
says."It put me through high school in Toronto and then Michigan
State." He figures he owes something to the game, so "as long as I can
help these guys improve, I'll stay out there."
There is a more personal side to how Stanford has affected Pat
Baldwin. Referring to current student attitudes toward politics, dope,
etc., he said, "Getting to know the guys off the ice has made me
aware of a lot of things I wouldn't have been aware of." He added
that it "has helped me a lot in business — I'm not as narrow-minded. I
can realize that there are a lot more things in life than money."
Sound like a computer salesman? Not really. One thing Pat forgot
to mention, though, was how he has helped Stanford's ice hockey
program grow to what it is today. But that's like him.
If you want to see a coach who can relate to and command the
respect of his players in an unusual light, just stop by the Rats some
Tuesday night after a game and see Pat in action. He's number 11 in
the red jersey.
