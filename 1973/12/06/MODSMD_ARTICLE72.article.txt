# Horpel Wins Wrestling Tourney
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Chris Horpel established
himself as one of the best
wrestlers in the eountry at the
University of Arizona Invitational
Tournament last weekend.
The 150-pound senior pinned
all of his opponents and was
named the outstanding wrestler of
the meet. Horpel's effort, plus a
good job by Ken Krebs (142),
who won two matches, helped
Stanford place ninth out of 23
teams.
Most of the best squads and
wrestlers in the country
participated in the tourney,
providing rough competition for
the seven Card grapplers who
accompanied coach Joe De Meo
to Tucson.
De Meo, though admittedly
optimistic, said that Horpel's
performance was "better than I
had ever expected."
In his final match, Horpel
pinned University of Washington
star Tom Brown, who placed third
in the NCAA last season.
There was one very
unfortunate side note to the
Cards' fine showing. John Govea
(190), last year's best freshman,
tore a ligament in his knee. He
was operated on Monday and will
be out for the season.
Most of the other Stanford
wrestlers were in action at the San
Jose Invitational Tournament,
also last weekend, under the
guidance of assistant coach Rich
Zweig.
De Meo cited Jim Tatarakis
(126), Jeff Richardson (167) and
Kris Westersund (Hwy) as the top
Card competitors in the local
meet.
Richardson won his first two
matches before suffering a
separated shoulder in the third.
He is expected to be back in
action in January.
The Cards will receive added
strength following winter break,
as Csary Anderson and Art
Estrada, both football players,
will be ready to see action.
Cal State-Humboldt will be
visiting Stanford on Jan. 3 to kick
off a tough winter quarter
schedule. The 7:30 p.m. contest is
slated for Encina Gym, but may
be changed to Maples Pavilion
because of the good turnouUat
the Cards' opening meet of the
season.
