# IBM Computer Purchase Causes Debate On Long-Term Policy
## 
### EZRA GREENHOUSE 
The University has made changes in
campus computer operations in the
past six months that will profoundly
affect both administrative and
academic computing in the next
decade.
The changes will centralize the
storage of administration, hospital,
and medical school data in Encina
Hall, and increase Stanford's overall
computer capacity 10 to 20 percent.
However, some faculty members
and students directly involved in
computer systems teaching and
research view the new situation
skeptically. They say the University's
expansion and centralization of
computer resources represents not
only a move away from faculty input
in computer policy, but also a
long-term commitment to machinery
suited more to administrative than
academic tasks.
Integrates Work
The controversial machinery is the
newly-purchased IBM 370/158, which
in conjunction with the University's
IBM 370/145 will integrate work
formerly done by separate computer
systems at the hospital and medical
school.
In a Nov. 26 interview, Charles
Dickens, director of administration
computer systems, said the University
purchased the IBM 370/158 when the
National Institute of Health (NIH)
terminated a $500,000 annual grant
that funded the medical school's
computer facility.
Dickens said the grant had been
renewed six years in succession, but
that medical school officials,
anticipating its discontinuation, had
been considering alternative plans for
more than a year.
High Cost Computer
Dickens, who valued the IBM
370/158 at over $1 million,
maintained that the computer would
serve a number of academic and
economic interests.
He claimed the combination of
medical school and hospital data had
been considered "intellectually sound"
for some time. He said the closing of
the medical school systems merely
catalyzed the larger changes.

Dickens alleged that the use of the
new computer would save costs by
allowing ACME (Advanced Computing
for Medical Education) work to be
carried on during the day, and hospital
administrative work at night.
Grant Money Saved
Conceding that technicians had
encountered greater difficulty in
transferring information from the
hospital's IBM 370/135 to the IBM
370/158 than had been originally
anticipated, Dickens nevertheless
pointed out that half the NIH grant
had been saved in lower computer
costs this year.
He added that Stanford was
fortunate to have the expertise on
campus that could install and service
the new computer.
Arguing that Encina Hall was the
safest, coolest and most spacious
location for the IBM 370/158, Dickens
claimed the computer's central
location made it accessible to most
students, and eased eventual problems
of distribution to the rest of the
campus.
Necessary Purchase
Dickens admitted that the addition
to Stanford's computer systems gave
the University more computer
capacity than it could use in the next
few years, but he asserted that the
saturation of previous facilities made
its acquisition necessary.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy disagrees strongly with the

University's decision to purchase the
IBM 370/158.
Expressing his reservations in a
Nov. 27 interview, McCarthy said the
new computer represented a "major,
long-term commitment in cash."
He claimed the purchase "seriously
reduced Stanford's freedom of choice"
in computer technology, and might
hamper effective use of computers in
teaching.
McCarthy alleged that IBM
equipment and policy were oriented
more to administrative "batch work"
than "interactive computing," the
type he insisted is needed for research
and education.
Past Dissatisfaction
Noting his long dissatisfaction with
University computer policy, McCarthy
revealed that he sent a letter to Pres.
Richard Lyman two years ago which
argued Stanford spent more per capita
on administrative computing than any
school in the country.
McCarthy added that the
acquisition of the IBM 370/158 by the
Provost's Committee had the effect of
bypassing the work of the Faculty
Committee on Computer Facilities
(CCF).
Although he did not deny that
circumstances demanded a change in
computer systems, McCarthy
maintained that Stanford opted for
greater administrative computer
facilities than the situation required.
Problems Expected
In defense of the University, Peter

Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, said dissatisfaction
with the new computer was inevitable,
but that the IBM 370/158 was an
"investment for the future."
Carpenter argued in a Nov. 28
interview that the University decision
was complex but not irresponsible.
Pointing out that labor costs have been
increasing steadily, Carpenter said that
administration would be cheaper and
more efficient when the value of the
new system was realized.
Dual Purpose
He claimed the IBM 370/158 served
a dual purpose; it merged the hitherto
separate responsibilities of hospital
and administration for in-patient and
out-patient records, and it satisfied the
needs of the medical school.
In answer to charges that the new
system was "batch work" oriented,
Carpenter maintained that Stanford
did more administrative than research
work, and that the University had to
weigh the demands of computer
science against computer uses on the
rest of the campus.
He ntoed that IBM had promised to
add "software" to the new computer
to facilitate "interactive computing."
Carpenter insisted that the CCF had
not been delegated responsibility for
University policy. He called the
Committee a "you call us, we're not
going to call you" advisory group.
The CCF is presently attempting to
make the new system work.

maintained that Stanford opted for
greater administrative computer
facilities than the situation required.
Problems Expected
In defense of the University, Peter

Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, said dissatisfaction
with the new computer was inevitable,
but that the IBM 370/158 was an
"investment for the future."
Carpenter argued in a Nov. 28
interview that the University decision
was complex but not irresponsible.
Pointing out that labor costs have been
increasing steadily, Carpenter said that
administration would be cheaper and
more efficient when the value of the
new system was realized.
Dual Purpose
He claimed the IBM 370/158 served
a dual purpose; it merged the hitherto
separate responsibilities of hospital
and administration for in-patient and
out-patient records, and it satisfied the
needs of the medical school.
In answer to charges that the new
system was "batch work" oriented,
Carpenter maintained that Stanford
did more administrative than research
work, and that the University had to
weigh the demands of computer
science against computer uses on the
rest of the campus.
He ntoed that IBM had promised to
add "software" to the new computer
to facilitate "interactive computing."
Carpenter insisted that the CCF had
not been delegated responsibility for
University policy. He called the
Committee a "you call us, we're not
going to call you" advisory group.
The CCF is presently attempting to
make the new system work.
The University has made changes in
campus computer operations in the
past six months that will profoundly
affect both administrative and
academic computing in the next
decade.
The changes will centralize the
storage of administration, hospital,
and medical school data in Encina
Hall, and increase Stanford's overall
computer capacity 10 to 20 percent.
However, some faculty members
and students directly involved in
computer systems teaching and
research view the new situation
skeptically. They say the University's
expansion and centralization of
computer resources represents not
only a move away from faculty input
in computer policy, but also a
long-term commitment to machinery
suited more to administrative than
academic tasks.
Integrates Work
The controversial machinery is the
newly-purchased IBM 370/158, which
in conjunction with the University's
IBM 370/145 will integrate work
formerly done by separate computer
systems at the hospital and medical
school.
In a Nov. 26 interview, Charles
Dickens, director of administration
computer systems, said the University
purchased the IBM 370/158 when the
National Institute of Health (NIH)
terminated a $500,000 annual grant
that funded the medical school's
computer facility.
Dickens said the grant had been
renewed six years in succession, but
that medical school officials,
anticipating its discontinuation, had
been considering alternative plans for
more than a year.
High Cost Computer
Dickens, who valued the IBM
370/158 at over $1 million,
maintained that the computer would
serve a number of academic and
economic interests.
He claimed the combination of
medical school and hospital data had
been considered "intellectually sound"
for some time. He said the closing of
the medical school systems merely
catalyzed the larger changes.

Dickens alleged that the use of the
new computer would save costs by
allowing ACME (Advanced Computing
for Medical Education) work to be
carried on during the day, and hospital
administrative work at night.
Grant Money Saved
Conceding that technicians had
encountered greater difficulty in
transferring information from the
hospital's IBM 370/135 to the IBM
370/158 than had been originally
anticipated, Dickens nevertheless
pointed out that half the NIH grant
had been saved in lower computer
costs this year.
He added that Stanford was
fortunate to have the expertise on
campus that could install and service
the new computer.
Arguing that Encina Hall was the
safest, coolest and most spacious
location for the IBM 370/158, Dickens
claimed the computer's central
location made it accessible to most
students, and eased eventual problems
of distribution to the rest of the
campus.
Necessary Purchase
Dickens admitted that the addition
to Stanford's computer systems gave
the University more computer
capacity than it could use in the next
few years, but he asserted that the
saturation of previous facilities made
its acquisition necessary.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy disagrees strongly with the

University's decision to purchase the
IBM 370/158.
Expressing his reservations in a
Nov. 27 interview, McCarthy said the
new computer represented a "major,
long-term commitment in cash."
He claimed the purchase "seriously
reduced Stanford's freedom of choice"
in computer technology, and might
hamper effective use of computers in
teaching.
McCarthy alleged that IBM
equipment and policy were oriented
more to administrative "batch work"
than "interactive computing," the
type he insisted is needed for research
and education.
Past Dissatisfaction
Noting his long dissatisfaction with
University computer policy, McCarthy
revealed that he sent a letter to Pres.
Richard Lyman two years ago which
argued Stanford spent more per capita
on administrative computing than any
school in the country.
McCarthy added that the
acquisition of the IBM 370/158 by the
Provost's Committee had the effect of
bypassing the work of the Faculty
Committee on Computer Facilities
(CCF).
Although he did not deny that
circumstances demanded a change in
computer systems, McCarthy
maintained that Stanford opted for
greater administrative computer
facilities than the situation required.

of distribution to the rest of the
campus.
Necessary Purchase
Dickens admitted that the addition
to Stanford's computer systems gave
the University more computer
capacity than it could use in the next
few years, but he asserted that the
saturation of previous facilities made
its acquisition necessary.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy disagrees strongly with the

University's decision to purchase the
IBM 370/158.
Expressing his reservations in a
Nov. 27 interview, McCarthy said the
new computer represented a "major,
long-term commitment in cash."
He claimed the purchase "seriously
reduced Stanford's freedom of choice"
in computer technology, and might
hamper effective use of computers in
teaching.
McCarthy alleged that IBM
equipment and policy were oriented
more to administrative "batch work"
than "interactive computing," the
type he insisted is needed for research
and education.
Past Dissatisfaction
Noting his long dissatisfaction with
University computer policy, McCarthy
revealed that he sent a letter to Pres.
Richard Lyman two years ago which
argued Stanford spent more per capita
on administrative computing than any
school in the country.
McCarthy added that the
acquisition of the IBM 370/158 by the
Provost's Committee had the effect of
bypassing the work of the Faculty
Committee on Computer Facilities
(CCF).
Although he did not deny that
circumstances demanded a change in
computer systems, McCarthy
maintained that Stanford opted for
greater administrative computer
facilities than the situation required.
Problems Expected
In defense of the University, Peter

Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, said dissatisfaction
with the new computer was inevitable,
but that the IBM 370/158 was an
"investment for the future."
Carpenter argued in a Nov. 28
interview that the University decision
was complex but not irresponsible.
Pointing out that labor costs have been
increasing steadily, Carpenter said that
administration would be cheaper and
more efficient when the value of the
new system was realized.
Dual Purpose
He claimed the IBM 370/158 served
a dual purpose; it merged the hitherto
separate responsibilities of hospital
and administration for in-patient and
out-patient records, and it satisfied the
needs of the medical school.
In answer to charges that the new
system was "batch work" oriented,
Carpenter maintained that Stanford
did more administrative than research
work, and that the University had to
weigh the demands of computer
science against computer uses on the
rest of the campus.
He ntoed that IBM had promised to
add "software" to the new computer
to facilitate "interactive computing."
Carpenter insisted that the CCF had
not been delegated responsibility for
University policy. He called the
Committee a "you call us, we're not
going to call you" advisory group.
The CCF is presently attempting to
make the new system work.
The University has made changes in
campus computer operations in the
past six months that will profoundly
affect both administrative and
academic computing in the next
decade.
The changes will centralize the
storage of administration, hospital,
and medical school data in Encina
Hall, and increase Stanford's overall
computer capacity 10 to 20 percent.
However, some faculty members
and students directly involved in
computer systems teaching and
research view the new situation
skeptically. They say the University's
expansion and centralization of
computer resources represents not
only a move away from faculty input
in computer policy, but also a
long-term commitment to machinery
suited more to administrative than
academic tasks.
Integrates Work
The controversial machinery is the
newly-purchased IBM 370/158, which
in conjunction with the University's
IBM 370/145 will integrate work
formerly done by separate computer
systems at the hospital and medical
school.
In a Nov. 26 interview, Charles
Dickens, director of administration
computer systems, said the University
purchased the IBM 370/158 when the
National Institute of Health (NIH)
terminated a $500,000 annual grant
that funded the medical school's
computer facility.
Dickens said the grant had been
renewed six years in succession, but
that medical school officials,
anticipating its discontinuation, had
been considering alternative plans for
more than a year.
High Cost Computer
Dickens, who valued the IBM
370/158 at over $1 million,
maintained that the computer would
serve a number of academic and
economic interests.
He claimed the combination of
medical school and hospital data had
been considered "intellectually sound"
for some time. He said the closing of
the medical school systems merely
catalyzed the larger changes.

Dickens alleged that the use of the
new computer would save costs by
allowing ACME (Advanced Computing
for Medical Education) work to be
carried on during the day, and hospital
administrative work at night.
Grant Money Saved
Conceding that technicians had
encountered greater difficulty in
transferring information from the
hospital's IBM 370/135 to the IBM
370/158 than had been originally
anticipated, Dickens nevertheless
pointed out that half the NIH grant
had been saved in lower computer
costs this year.
He added that Stanford was
fortunate to have the expertise on
campus that could install and service
the new computer.
Arguing that Encina Hall was the
safest, coolest and most spacious
location for the IBM 370/158, Dickens
claimed the computer's central
location made it accessible to most
students, and eased eventual problems
of distribution to the rest of the
campus.
