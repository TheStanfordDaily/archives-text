# Pre-Meds Examine Doctors' 'Real World'
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
Like rats trapped in a Skinner box,
some Stanford pre-meds hemmed in
by depressing statistics of med school
acceptance ratios, MCAT averages, and
grade-point cut-offs seem to be
developing new behavior patterns to
cope with the fierce competition.
Eschewing the straight and narrow
path of pure academia, they are asking
for, and getting, programs that involve
them more directly with the realities
of the medical profession.
Last fall, senior pre-med Mary
Woodfork developed an undergraduate
special seminar, "Introduction to the
Medical Profession," with the help of
sponsors Count Gibson of the Med
School and Psychology Prof. William
Dement. The three-unit course
brought in experts on such diverse
topics as terminal illness and consumer
health.
The 15 students in the course
particiapted in guided tours of hospital
wards and research labs, including the
Stanford Heart Disease Prevention lab
and the Stanford Sleep Clinic. Each
student also presented a research paper
to the class on some area in medicine.
Woodfork had realized that
pre-meds need to confront the often
painful and gruesome realities of
clinical practice after taking a course
in "Community and Preventive
Medicine."
"The course made me think

seriously about the profession," she
said. "We talked about death and
dying, drug problems, minorities in
medicine, and the social aspects of
medicine," she said.
Students were generally
enthusiastic about "Introduction to
the Medical Profession." Liz Vasquez,
a sophomore, thought the course had
been "really great. Taking that class
really got me into medicine again. This
brought experience down to a personal
level. Most pre-med students go into
med school without knowing what it's
really about."
Exposure to Problems
Dave Beck, a freshman in the
course, thought it provided "good
exposure to some of the current
problems" by allowing the students to
visit the autopsy and the infectious
disease labs.
Freshman John Bassett also praised
the chance to "get to see the inner
workings of the med school," but
admitted that he might have gotten
too close at one point. During the
autopsy session, he had "gotten sick"
and been forced to leave the room.
Woodfork says that
"pre-professional exposure" to all
facets of medicine is important in
dispelling "Marcus Wellby illusions"
that might plague pre-meds.
"Interviewers are interested in
finding out how realistic an idea
students have of medicine," she said.
Course Expanded
This winter, Woodfork and Med
School Prof. Martin Karasek will work
on expanding the course to
accomodate perhaps 100 students.
They also hope that the improved
spring quarter version will be able to
discuss a broader range of topics,
including alternatives to medicine in
health-related fields such as dentistry,
pharmacology and ecological
engineering.
However, Karasek was pessimistic
in discussing students' probable
reactions to such alternatives. "Most
students are not intrigued by dentistry
after they've set their minds on
medical school," he said.
For those not planning to take
"Introduction to the Medical
Profession," the Stanford Pre-Med
Society offers coffee hours and talks
with medicine professors. It also
arranges "Day With a Doctor"
programs in which students follow
specialists on their rounds.
"It's much more exciting when
you're applying knowledge," said
Pre-Med Society Liaison Mike Roller.
"Many freshmen have their only
contact with medicine in their
classes."
