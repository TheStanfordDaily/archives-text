# Beutelsbach Youth Center
## Pub-Club Provides Liaison 
### 
Stanford-in-Germany is not Beutelsbach's only
significant organization. The town now has a highly
successful Jugendzentrum (Youth Center). It is one
of many in West Germany, but its growth and
strength are unusual, and its connection with
Stanford is one of its strong points.
The Center began in February, 1972, when a
handful of people started meeting on a regular basis.
Gisela Harle, one of the few, explained, "At first it
was difficult. About three of us kept it going, and in
the summer everyone seemed to lose interest."
However in September momentum picked up again
and a solid group of young people coalesced. The
Burgermeister granted them the use of a one-time
prison tower on the wall of the town's 450 year old
church which they christened Spatzennest
(Sparrow's Nest), and opened in December.
At the same time they set down their rules of
government. There are no formally elected leaders,
except for a financial officer who processes all
transactions. At regular Wednesday meetings there
are four "clerks" who maintain order and record the
minutes. These positions are filled by different
members of the Center each week. All activities and
policies are decided by majority vote.
The Spatzennest is run like a sort of pub-club. It
is open everyday from afternoon until evening,
sometimes as late as one or two a.m. Beer, Coke,
Fanta, and Fruit Juices chilled in a refrigerator are
sold. There is a record player, lots of comfortable
furniture, books, and games. Posters,
announcements, and the monthly calendar of events
cover the walls. Other facilities are open for the use
of the Center; 1) An Old-School-Kitchen, where a
crafts evening and weekly meetings are held; 2) The
Zehntscheuer houses bathrooms, a ping-pong table,
and a pair of basketball hoops; 3) The Gymnastics
Room, shared with other organizations, is used for
films.
Numerous Activities
The life of the Center is embodied in the prolific
activities, invented and supervised solely by the
youth. In addition to weekly meetings there is a
film evening, a crafts evening, and a weekly political
discussion group.
Single events include hikes, parties (for example,
a Christmas tree bonfire with food and wine on the
hill behind Stanford-in-Germany), a book sale,
refreshment and information booths at town
festivals, soccer games with Stanford and Schon
Buhl (a local corrective facility for juveniles), stage
plays, and rock and jazz concerts.
In mid-June of this year, the Center hosted a
Polish Dixieland Jazz Band, the "Old Metropolitan"
Band from Krakow, in an outdoor concert. It was a
huge success, attended by more than 800 people.
"We weren't out to make money, like commercial
Beerfests," said Robi Loffler. "The main point was
to offer something to the community that it
couldn't normally get, to bring the people
together." Which is what happened.
Fulfilling Relationship
The relationship between the Youth Center and
Stanford is a fulfilling one in several respects. There
is, of course, much socializing. There were Stanford
students at the Dixieland Concert, and at the
Christmas tree bonfire. Whenever there is a party in
the Ratskeller, the campus pub, a large number

from the Spatzennest art 1 usually there. Howeve
eontact has increased. In the present group (XXXI
about ten students went on a camping trip with a
equal number from the Center in the Schwabis
Alps.
Group XXXI presented a slide-lecture o
Vietnam early in the present quarter, which seven
from the Center saw. They were so impressed tha
they arranged to have it reshown in Beutelsbach th
following week.
Students also have contributed to the Center
activities. One student from group XXVII
organized a production of four Brecht one-act play
last June. Two other students assisted with th
technical preparations. Stanford loaned the Cente
some flats and its lighting system.
Involvement In German Culture
This contact is significant for both sides. Fo
Stanford it is an excellent way of becoming involve'
in the culture. For the Youth Center it is both
source of personal interaction and a public relation
benefit. Hans-Jorg Maier said, "If we keep u
contact with the campus, it lends prestige to th
Jugenzentrum in the eyes of the community."
Public relations is something of a problem for th
Center. In establishing their existence, they hav
found many skeptics among the elde
Beutelsbachers, who feel that it is all just a passin
fancy. Many would like to see the youth turn to th
YMCA for involvement. However, one of the prim
reasons for founding the Center was the stagnatioi
of all other youth groups.
In a Statement of Purpose (Selbstverstandnis) th
youth claimed that "The YMCA is run by adult
and is solely Christian. It is not responsive to th
real needs of the young, and it is not of any interes
to the large number of atheists. Therefore ai
organization run for and by young people i
required." However, the Beutelsbach Center is no
working against the community. In nearb-
Strumpfelbach, where this attitude of antagonist
was adopted, tensions resulted in the Burgermeiste
closing down that Center. Robi Loffler commented
"Ours is not a fight against the town. We are strivin
for integral work." Constantly they are trying t<
improve relations through publication of thei
monthly calendar of events in the town newspape
and information evenings for parents a chance ti
find out about the Center. The success of th
Dixielandfest increased their level of acceptance.
Promising Future
The future of the Jugendzentrum appears strong
There are some problems to be met such as fightinj
resulting fromdrunkennessand repeated burglary o
the Spatzennest and theft of the cashbox.
Nonetheless the outlook is bright. The mos
recent, and by far the most important, developmen
for the Center was the approval of a sum of 300,00(
Marks ($120,000), 50,000 from the county aiu
250,000 from Beutelsbach, for structura
modification. Construction may be hindered bj
winter and snow, but should be complete by thi
summer of 1974. The youth are confident of ai
exciting future, when they will explore and develof
more fully their new found political and socia
independence.
