Black Panther Programs
Editor:
The article concerning Bobby Seale's speech which appeared in the
Nov. 29 issue of the Daily was, in part, a misrepresentation of what he
said.
First, and most importantly, the "proposed organization of '1000
escorts and 100 vans' " is not, as the article stated "to protect
blacks," but is for the protection of senior citizens, regardless of race.
As Mr. Seale said, an organization called Gray Power asked the Black
Panther Party for help to protect the senior citizens, after the Oakland
Police Department refused to offer any such assistance.
Secondly, the Community Learning Center, as I understand it, is
"an alternative education center," period, not just for minority
groups. The emphasis is on improving the abilities of minority
children, but as a whole, the Center serves as a model educational
institute. Although the primary beneficiaries of Panther programs are
black people, I think you should have brought out that the general
focus of the Party is community-wide, as Mr. Seale stated. I hope that
you will take care in representing the views of speakers on campus
more conscientiously in the future as I believe have generally done
until now.

In Retrospect
Editor:
It was difficult for us to believe the news that there is some
intention of transferring the Stanford Campus from Beutelsbach to
Berlin or another big city.
We, the youth from Beutelsbach and the surroundings, are the
initiators and the visitors of the Beutelsbach Youth House, which
opens its doors to all youth, including the students from Stanford.
Up to now, a good relationship has developed between every
Group and the local young people, a relationship that not only
extends to personal and general conversations but also to mutual
enterprises and work activities (among them a weekend together in
Urach, a slide presentation on Vietnam, theatre performances, etc.).
Therefore, we are of the opinion that the transfer of
Stanford-in-Germany would mean a great loss both for the American
students as well as the young people and also the older members of
Beutelsbach and surrounding communities with whom excellent
relations have been established. Close human relationship cannot be
replaced by the atmosphere of a large city and the anonymity which
prevails in that atmosphere.
We heard that a reason for the transfer to a big city was the
cultural attractions to be found there (for example, theatre, ballet,
etc.). But Stuttgart lies only a distance of approximately 12 miles
from Beutelsbach. So the students are also in the position to visit the
cultural events in Stuttgart and simultaneously to acquaint themselves
with our way of life in the friendly atmosphere of our small town.
In these students we have not only found acquaintances but also
real friends. For this reason we hope that the decision will not be
made effective and that Stanford will remain in Beutelsbach.

Publications Board Procedures
Editor:
I would like to clarify several points raised in John Freed's article
on the ASSU Publications Board (Daily, Nov. 28).
First, "establishment" publications did not usurp a fee assessment
that was "ostensibly to aid new or struggling media." The fee

assessment that students approved in a Spring 1972 referendum was
proposed by the Publications Board member publications — the
Chaparral, Daily, Quad, and Sequoia — for their own benefit; only a
Daily opinion column supporting it mentioned the possibility that
funds might also be granted as "seed money" to new publications.
(This, by the way, was the first refundable fee assessment, before
refunds were made mandatory.)
In Autumn 1972, when the money was collected, these
"establishment" publications plus the Blotter controlled an absolute
majority of Board votes (student government and Administration, not
other publications, accounted for the rest); they could easily and
justifiably have shared the assessment solely among themselves.
Instead the members solicited widespread proposals and appropriated
fully half the money spent to "new or struggling" publications. For
this they deserve credit, not blame. Moreover, far from consolidating
their power,they initiated by-law changes in the ASSU Senate to allow
the admission of new members to the Board.
Second, the Board has not naively or selfishly hidden an $8000
surplus. Income from the Blotter and the Money Book, used in the
past primarily to pay the debt incurred by the Quad, has increased
dramatically this year, so that unaccustomed revenue will indeed
eventually be available. These funds, however, flow in gradually, not
as a lump sum, and so far exist only on paper. A committee to
consider how to spend the money will meet in January at a time that
will be well publicized in the Daily. Meanwhile all publications are
invited to seek space, advice, or membership from the Board; call the
Chair, Gordon Imrie, at 321-3017.

KZSU's New Format Praised
Ed itor:
John Broholm is absolutely right in calling (in last Friday's Daily)
for Stanford community members to make their feelings known to
KZSU management about the station's new music format.
All right, Mr. Broholm, I will. I like it.
The new format is not "Top-40" in the sense that programmers are
compelled to play the songs on Billboard's weekly charts. KZSU
programmers do not, in the words of one unforgettable AM jingle,
have to play "all the hits all the time." The new format simply insures
that those of us who don't care for three solid hours of
"In-A-Gada—Da-Vida" and Black Sabbath have some reason to listen
to the station besides news and public affairs.
The format may have some flaws that will hopefully be worked
out, but overall I find it a commendable effort to bring the station's
musical programming more in line with the varied tastes of the
community.

Chileans Speak Out
Editor:
As an unconcerned Latin American student (but no scholar), I
would like to comment on the Concerned Latin American Scholar s
column in the Daily, Nov. 27.
The authors themselves refer to Chile as 'a country which, we must
confess, we scarcely know.' Their call for repudiation of views
different from their own is thus based on their superior moral position
(upon which they expatiate at loving length), and on the 'fact' that
Chilean students 'cannot dare answer them |Mr. Philippi and Mr.
Vinuela] publicly' for fear of retaliation eitheragainst them or against
their families.
Although I admire the CLAS authors for their skill at creating
facts, their argument is a shade too circular, isn't it? If Chilean

students do not write in the Daily, it is because they fear for the lives
of their families. If they do, and support the present Junta, it i<
presumably because they have been forced to under dire threats.
Hence, either Chilean students support the CLAS position in writing
or they 'confirm 1 it by not doing so. Quite Charming.

Carpool To Work
Editor:
For those employees interested in forming car pools to and from
work, this suggestion from a fellow worker might be worth passing on
Just look down the Faculty-Staff Directory for telephone prefixe'
that you recognize are in the area where you live, and give them a call
It takes only a few minutes, and really works!

Correspond With An Inmate
Editor:
The Prison Information Center is organizing several project;
relating to the prison system of California, but we are restricted by i
severe shortage of volunteer help. Right now our immediate concern i>
Inside/Out, a program which establishes correspondence betweei
people on the outside and prisoners in more than a dozen pena
institutions in California.
We're short of woman or manpower in three major areas: 1
processing and filing of incoming letters to get correspondences going
We need a number of people to volunteer an hour or so a week o!
their time for this; 2) helping out with publicity and genera
dissemination of information to the community to get mon
"outsiders" involved in the program; 3) On the most basic levei
people willing to write to prisoners. Inside/Out isn't necessarily »
"pen-pal" program.
In addition to the attempt at keeping an inmate aware of life oi
the outside, the person on the outside may become increasingly awan
of conditions in the prisons through the correspondence. Often orv
can be instrumental in referring prisoners to various service ant
resource centers which provide legal assistance, job placement, etc
The PIC provides specific channels for such requests. Letters we gc
from some prisoners indicate they have had no correspondence for a
many as seven years or more (not unlike some Stanford students!) anc
since time inside the walls flows on with very little to remind theri
they are human, that there arc things to become aware of anr
motivated about, this lack in combination with all the routine
dehumanizing processes of prison life can really take its to<
emotionally.
If anyone is willing to correspond with a prisoner and/or help ou
with any aspect of the Inside/Out program, we need you! Even if
you'd like to wait until after exam period to begin, please leave your
name at the Prison Information Center in the Old Firehouse, or in thr
box at the ASSU office or the Round Room of Memorial Church
with your address and phone and an indication of how you'd like to
become involved. Or call the PIC at x 2677, or 326-4057. If you leavv
your name to be matched with a prisoner's, the responsibility restf
with the inmate to write the first letter.
