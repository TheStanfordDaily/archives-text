# Injury-Prone Frost 'Makes It Happen'
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Dave Frost may score 30 points tonight
against Colorado State. Or he may not even
suit up.
The rugged senior from Long Beach scored
23 points against nationally-ranked Houston
in his collef»p debut two years ago, but
because of injuries, he has yet to play a full
season. The 6-6, 220 lb. swingman has
endured two long seasons with chronic back
trouble.
And as if the muscle spasms in his back
weren't enough, Frost unveiled a new injury
this season — a damaged right knee that would
probably make Joe Namath cringe.
"His game performance has been hurt quite
a bit by injuries," explains assistant coach Bub
Bowling. "Only those people who see him
practice every day realize how good he really
is."
Well, not exactly. For the past two seasons,
those people who have seen Stanford's David
Challenge the Goliath of college basketball,
the UCLA Bruins, realize how good he is.
Those who witnessed his one-man second half
scoring assault on Virginia Tech last season are
not ignorant of Frost's talent. And the 5,000
fans in Maples Pavilion who watched him shut
off USF's Kevin Restani have a pretty good
idea of what he can do on the basketball
court.

"Dave's always looking to create
something, to make something happen — he
won't hide in the background," says Bowling.
"He puts in a consistently hard effort in every
practice."
Injuries willing, that is. Dave explains that,
"This year I play a little more cautiously — I
think it's wiser not to push it."
When he's healthy Frost plays the game
with a smoothness that belies an athlete of his
physical stature. His quickness, mobility and
shooting touch combine with his heighth and
physical strength to form a player who's
tough to defend. "He must be guarded by a
quick player," says Bowling, and "it's difficult
to find someone who's as quick and as big."
Frost's quickness was hampered a year ago
by his size — he was 10-15 pounds heavier —
and head coach Howie Dallmar ordered him
to trim down, afraid that his weight was
aggravating his back problems.
He lost the weight, but his back and knee
problems remain, making his playing time a
continual question mark.
He did clock enough playing time the past
two seasons to be one of the Cards' top
scorers each year, averaging nine points a
game last season, and 10.5 his sophomore
campaign. And he's managed to stay out of
the doctor's office each spring, enabling him
to become one of Stanford's top pitchers
during two years of Stanford baseball.

In fact, baseball is probably his best sport,
and the opportunity to play both baseball and
basketball was one of the reasons he chose to
come to the Farm. The curly-haired Political
Science major has his eye on a career with a
professional baseball team.
Frost came to Stanford after a year at
Long Beach City College, where he was named
All-State in both basketball and baseball. At
Long Beach he was converted to a forward
from the center position he had played in high
school, and the move apparently paid off, as
LBCC won the State championship.
Frost brought a winning tradition with him
to Stanford. The year before he came the
Cards finished 6-20; last year they had their
first winning season in six years with a 14-11
mark, and Frost is confident the Cards will
improve on that record this year.
His goal is second place in the Pac-8, and
believes that "we could beat UCLA on a given
night." The change in attitude is apparent —
the team is playing with more confidence this
year.
Much of the credit for the new attitude
must go to the coaches, who have created a
"common goal" while allowing each team
member to retain a sense of individuality.
"The coaches don't try to run your life off
the court,"says Frost. Obviously, the way the
talented senior performs on the court is
enough for coaches Dallmar and Bowling.

member to retain a sense of individuality.
"The coaches don't try to run your life off
the court,"says Frost. Obviously, the way the
talented senior performs on the court is
enough for coaches Dallmar and Bowling.
Dave Frost may score 30 points tonight
against Colorado State. Or he may not even
suit up.
The rugged senior from Long Beach scored
23 points against nationally-ranked Houston
in his collef»p debut two years ago, but
because of injuries, he has yet to play a full
season. The 6-6, 220 lb. swingman has
endured two long seasons with chronic back
trouble.
And as if the muscle spasms in his back
weren't enough, Frost unveiled a new injury
this season — a damaged right knee that would
probably make Joe Namath cringe.
"His game performance has been hurt quite
a bit by injuries," explains assistant coach Bub
Bowling. "Only those people who see him
practice every day realize how good he really
is."
Well, not exactly. For the past two seasons,
those people who have seen Stanford's David
Challenge the Goliath of college basketball,
the UCLA Bruins, realize how good he is.
Those who witnessed his one-man second half
scoring assault on Virginia Tech last season are
not ignorant of Frost's talent. And the 5,000
fans in Maples Pavilion who watched him shut
off USF's Kevin Restani have a pretty good
idea of what he can do on the basketball
court.

"Dave's always looking to create
something, to make something happen — he
won't hide in the background," says Bowling.
"He puts in a consistently hard effort in every
practice."
Injuries willing, that is. Dave explains that,
"This year I play a little more cautiously — I
think it's wiser not to push it."
When he's healthy Frost plays the game
with a smoothness that belies an athlete of his
physical stature. His quickness, mobility and
shooting touch combine with his heighth and
physical strength to form a player who's
tough to defend. "He must be guarded by a
quick player," says Bowling, and "it's difficult
to find someone who's as quick and as big."
Frost's quickness was hampered a year ago
by his size — he was 10-15 pounds heavier —
and head coach Howie Dallmar ordered him
to trim down, afraid that his weight was
aggravating his back problems.
He lost the weight, but his back and knee
problems remain, making his playing time a
continual question mark.
He did clock enough playing time the past
two seasons to be one of the Cards' top
scorers each year, averaging nine points a
game last season, and 10.5 his sophomore
campaign. And he's managed to stay out of
the doctor's office each spring, enabling him
to become one of Stanford's top pitchers
during two years of Stanford baseball.

In fact, baseball is probably his best sport,
and the opportunity to play both baseball and
basketball was one of the reasons he chose to
come to the Farm. The curly-haired Political
Science major has his eye on a career with a
professional baseball team.
Frost came to Stanford after a year at
Long Beach City College, where he was named
All-State in both basketball and baseball. At
Long Beach he was converted to a forward
from the center position he had played in high
school, and the move apparently paid off, as
LBCC won the State championship.
Frost brought a winning tradition with him
to Stanford. The year before he came the
Cards finished 6-20; last year they had their
first winning season in six years with a 14-11
mark, and Frost is confident the Cards will
improve on that record this year.
His goal is second place in the Pac-8, and
believes that "we could beat UCLA on a given
night." The change in attitude is apparent —
the team is playing with more confidence this
year.
Much of the credit for the new attitude
must go to the coaches, who have created a
"common goal" while allowing each team
member to retain a sense of individuality.
"The coaches don't try to run your life off
the court,"says Frost. Obviously, the way the
talented senior performs on the court is
