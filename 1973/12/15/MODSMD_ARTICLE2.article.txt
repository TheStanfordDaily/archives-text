# Veteran Coaches Direct Towering Teams Tonight
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
When Howie Dallmar and Jim
Williams began coaching at
Stanford and Colorado State,
rulesmakers hadn't even begun to
think about goaltending, dunking
or offensive interference. Tall
meant 6-4 or so, and the game was
characterized by hustling guards
with crew cuts who tossed in
two-handed set shots.
Now, though, 20 years and
more than 500 victories later,
Dallmar and Williams are coaching
a pair of teams that epitomize the
modern game. Dallmar's
skyscraping Cardinals meet
Williams' equally towering Rams
at 8 p.m. tonight in a contest
neither coach even dreamed about
in 1954.
Dallmar's 20th anniversary at
the Farm should be brightened
considerably by giant Rich Kelley
(7-0), Tim Patterson (6-11), Mike
Mann (6-9) and Ed Schweitzer
(6-BV2). Williams, meanwhile, is
also spending his 20th season
looking upward. His roster
includes Brent Wilson (6-11), Ed
Mullaney (6-9), Como Pontliana
(6-8) and Tim Hall (6-8).
Dallmar, whose 341-288
coaching record (including six
years) at Pennsylvania) places him
sixth among active coaches, is still
mystified by his current Cardinal
squad. "It'll take a few more
games before we really discover
our major strengths and
weaknesses," he said after a

typically unpredictable opening
weekend.
'World Of Difference'
Stanford looked miserable in a
76-69 debacle against
Nevada-Reno last Friday and then
bounced back three days later to
defeat nationally ranked USF,
63-61. "There was a world of
difference in the two games in our
whole approach and execution,"
Dallmar understated.
Tonight, the Cards might do
anything. Final exams occupied
most of the week, and the team
was able to squeeze in only two
normal workouts. Colorado State,
meanwhile, stayed sharp with
games against Air Force and
Fresno State.
But exams are over now, and
the eased pressure may produce
some frenetic performances.
Kelley, having conquered
developmental and physiological
psychology, may release all his
inhibitions on the court tonight.
Last year, when the same two
teams met in Fort Collins
following finals, he wildly
scrambled to a 22-point,
20-rebound, 12-tumover effort as
the Cards dropped an error-filled
77-72 decision in the final 30
seconds.
Only two starters return from
that opportunistic Ram squad,
but Williams hopes height can
successfully replace experience.
Last year's top three scorers all
graduated, however, including

guard Gary Rhoades, who led the
team in both scoring and
rebounding.
Hall Outstanding
In Rhoades' absence, forward
Tim Hall has filled the void,
scoring 38 points and grabbing 23
rebounds in Colorado State's first
two games.
The only other returning
starter, 6-8 forward Como
Pontliana, is still fighting a strange
penchant for referees' whistles.
Last year Pontliana committed
114 infractions and fouled out of
16 games — a fact that brings back
nostalgic memories of famed
Stanford hacker Jack Loomis.
Rounding out the CSU starting
five are center Brent Wilson, one
of two married players on the
Ram squad (he is appropriately
majoring in child development
and family relations), and guards
Danny Phillips and Rudy Carey.
Dal I mar will probably start
Kelley, Mann, Scott Trobbe,
Melvin Arterberry and Jim
Montague, but he continues to
emphasize that starting lineups are
irrelevent. "We'll probably use at
least 10 players tonight and
Monday |against St. Mary's]," he
said, indicating that one probable
combination will feature
Patterson at one wing position
with Kelley and Schweitzer in the
posts — a huge lineup that was
devastating against USF.
More Time For Bluitt
Dallmar also said that guard
Ben Bluitt ("our quickest player
besides Arterberry") will see
considerable action.
Stanford's coaching staff is still
puzzled by two major question
marks. Starting guards Montague
and Arterberry are shooting only
11.1 and 22.2 percent
respectively, and the physical
condition of Mann and Dave Frost
remains in doubt.
"The guards are a lot better
than they've shown," Dallmar
insists. "They were just awfully
tight in those two games."
And the injuries? "I think
Mann will be OK," he said, "but
with Frost it's just a day to day
thing ... we just never know
when he's going to be able to
play."

Dal I mar will probably start
Kelley, Mann, Scott Trobbe,

irrelevent. "We'll probably use at

Monday |against St. Mary's]," he
said, indicating that one probable
combination will feature
Patterson at one wing position
with Kelley and Schweitzer in the
posts — a huge lineup that was
devastating against USF.
More Time For Bluitt
Dallmar also said that guard
Ben Bluitt ("our quickest player
besides Arterberry") will see
considerable action.
Stanford's coaching staff is still
puzzled by two major question
marks. Starting guards Montague
and Arterberry are shooting only
11.1 and 22.2 percent
respectively, and the physical
condition of Mann and Dave Frost
remains in doubt.
"The guards are a lot better
than they've shown," Dallmar
insists. "They were just awfully
tight in those two games."
And the injuries? "I think
Mann will be OK," he said, "but
with Frost it's just a day to day
thing ... we just never know
when he's going to be able to
play."

FROST FOR TWO—Senior forward Dave Frost scores two points on a
drive in the Cards' opening loss to Nevada-Reno. The 6-6,
220-pounder from Long Beach has played brilliantly at times, but has
been slowed for most of his career with injuries.
When Howie Dallmar and Jim
Williams began coaching at
Stanford and Colorado State,
rulesmakers hadn't even begun to
think about goaltending, dunking
or offensive interference. Tall
meant 6-4 or so, and the game was
characterized by hustling guards
with crew cuts who tossed in
two-handed set shots.
Now, though, 20 years and
more than 500 victories later,
Dallmar and Williams are coaching
a pair of teams that epitomize the
modern game. Dallmar's
skyscraping Cardinals meet
Williams' equally towering Rams
at 8 p.m. tonight in a contest
neither coach even dreamed about
in 1954.
Dallmar's 20th anniversary at
the Farm should be brightened
considerably by giant Rich Kelley
(7-0), Tim Patterson (6-11), Mike
Mann (6-9) and Ed Schweitzer
(6-BV2). Williams, meanwhile, is
also spending his 20th season
looking upward. His roster
includes Brent Wilson (6-11), Ed
Mullaney (6-9), Como Pontliana
(6-8) and Tim Hall (6-8).
Dallmar, whose 341-288
coaching record (including six
years) at Pennsylvania) places him
sixth among active coaches, is still
mystified by his current Cardinal
squad. "It'll take a few more
games before we really discover
our major strengths and
weaknesses," he said after a

typically unpredictable opening
weekend.
'World Of Difference'
Stanford looked miserable in a
76-69 debacle against
Nevada-Reno last Friday and then
bounced back three days later to
defeat nationally ranked USF,
63-61. "There was a world of
difference in the two games in our
whole approach and execution,"
Dallmar understated.
Tonight, the Cards might do
anything. Final exams occupied
most of the week, and the team
was able to squeeze in only two
normal workouts. Colorado State,
meanwhile, stayed sharp with
games against Air Force and
Fresno State.
But exams are over now, and
the eased pressure may produce
some frenetic performances.
Kelley, having conquered
developmental and physiological
psychology, may release all his
inhibitions on the court tonight.
Last year, when the same two
teams met in Fort Collins
following finals, he wildly
scrambled to a 22-point,
20-rebound, 12-tumover effort as
the Cards dropped an error-filled
77-72 decision in the final 30
seconds.
Only two starters return from
that opportunistic Ram squad,
but Williams hopes height can
successfully replace experience.
Last year's top three scorers all
graduated, however, including

guard Gary Rhoades, who led the
team in both scoring and
rebounding.
Hall Outstanding
In Rhoades' absence, forward
Tim Hall has filled the void,
scoring 38 points and grabbing 23
rebounds in Colorado State's first
two games.
The only other returning
starter, 6-8 forward Como
Pontliana, is still fighting a strange
penchant for referees' whistles.
Last year Pontliana committed
114 infractions and fouled out of
16 games — a fact that brings back
nostalgic memories of famed
Stanford hacker Jack Loomis.
Rounding out the CSU starting
five are center Brent Wilson, one
of two married players on the
Ram squad (he is appropriately
majoring in child development
and family relations), and guards
Danny Phillips and Rudy Carey.
Dal I mar will probably start
Kelley, Mann, Scott Trobbe,

squad. "It'll take a few more
games before we really discover
our major strengths and
weaknesses," he said after a

typically unpredictable opening
weekend.
'World Of Difference'
Stanford looked miserable in a
76-69 debacle against
Nevada-Reno last Friday and then
bounced back three days later to
defeat nationally ranked USF,
63-61. "There was a world of
difference in the two games in our
whole approach and execution,"
Dallmar understated.
Tonight, the Cards might do
anything. Final exams occupied
most of the week, and the team
was able to squeeze in only two
normal workouts. Colorado State,
meanwhile, stayed sharp with
games against Air Force and
Fresno State.
But exams are over now, and
the eased pressure may produce
some frenetic performances.
Kelley, having conquered
developmental and physiological
psychology, may release all his
inhibitions on the court tonight.
Last year, when the same two
teams met in Fort Collins
following finals, he wildly
scrambled to a 22-point,
20-rebound, 12-tumover effort as
the Cards dropped an error-filled
77-72 decision in the final 30
seconds.
Only two starters return from
that opportunistic Ram squad,
but Williams hopes height can
successfully replace experience.
Last year's top three scorers all
graduated, however, including

guard Gary Rhoades, who led the
team in both scoring and
rebounding.
Hall Outstanding
In Rhoades' absence, forward
Tim Hall has filled the void,
scoring 38 points and grabbing 23
rebounds in Colorado State's first
two games.
The only other returning
starter, 6-8 forward Como
Pontliana, is still fighting a strange
penchant for referees' whistles.
Last year Pontliana committed
114 infractions and fouled out of
16 games — a fact that brings back
nostalgic memories of famed
Stanford hacker Jack Loomis.
Rounding out the CSU starting
five are center Brent Wilson, one
of two married players on the
Ram squad (he is appropriately
majoring in child development
and family relations), and guards
Danny Phillips and Rudy Carey.
Dal I mar will probably start
Kelley, Mann, Scott Trobbe,
Melvin Arterberry and Jim
Montague, but he continues to
emphasize that starting lineups are
irrelevent. "We'll probably use at
least 10 players tonight and
Monday |against St. Mary's]," he
said, indicating that one probable
combination will feature
Patterson at one wing position
with Kelley and Schweitzer in the
posts — a huge lineup that was
devastating against USF.
More Time For Bluitt
Dallmar also said that guard
Ben Bluitt ("our quickest player
besides Arterberry") will see
considerable action.
Stanford's coaching staff is still
puzzled by two major question
marks. Starting guards Montague
and Arterberry are shooting only
11.1 and 22.2 percent
respectively, and the physical
condition of Mann and Dave Frost
remains in doubt.
"The guards are a lot better
than they've shown," Dallmar
insists. "They were just awfully
tight in those two games."
And the injuries? "I think
Mann will be OK," he said, "but
with Frost it's just a day to day
thing ... we just never know
when he's going to be able to
play."

FROST FOR TWO—Senior forward Dave Frost scores two points on a
drive in the Cards' opening loss to Nevada-Reno. The 6-6,
220-pounder from Long Beach has played brilliantly at times, but has
been slowed for most of his career with injuries.
When Howie Dallmar and Jim
Williams began coaching at
Stanford and Colorado State,
rulesmakers hadn't even begun to
think about goaltending, dunking
or offensive interference. Tall
meant 6-4 or so, and the game was
characterized by hustling guards
with crew cuts who tossed in
two-handed set shots.
Now, though, 20 years and
more than 500 victories later,
Dallmar and Williams are coaching
a pair of teams that epitomize the
modern game. Dallmar's
skyscraping Cardinals meet
Williams' equally towering Rams
at 8 p.m. tonight in a contest
neither coach even dreamed about
in 1954.
Dallmar's 20th anniversary at
the Farm should be brightened
considerably by giant Rich Kelley
(7-0), Tim Patterson (6-11), Mike
Mann (6-9) and Ed Schweitzer
(6-BV2). Williams, meanwhile, is
also spending his 20th season
looking upward. His roster
includes Brent Wilson (6-11), Ed
Mullaney (6-9), Como Pontliana
(6-8) and Tim Hall (6-8).
Dallmar, whose 341-288
coaching record (including six
years) at Pennsylvania) places him
sixth among active coaches, is still
mystified by his current Cardinal
squad. "It'll take a few more
games before we really discover
our major strengths and
weaknesses," he said after a
