# Tough Foes Await Cardinals On Eastern Holiday Swing
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
With finals over, Stanford's basketball team can
look forward to an enjoyable trip to Lexington,
Kentucky, and New York City. But it will definitely
be a working vacation.
It'll take a lot of work for Stanford to beat either
of the team's initial foes, Ohio State at the
Kentucky Invitational Dec. 21 and LaSalle at the
Holiday Invitational in Madison Square Garden Dec.
27.
Ohio State has beaten Penn State and Texas —
Arlington, and took sixth-ranked Notre Dame into
overtime before bowing 76-72. The Buckeyes, a
perennial Big 10 basketball power, are led by 6-7
forward Wardell Jackson, who averaged 15.9 points
per game last season. Jackson has met up with Rich
Kelley in stranger places than the blue grass state —
the two were on the State Department sponsored
team that toured China this past summer.
Kelley will have some advantage in this game, as
Ohio State's center, sophomore Craig Taylor, is only
6-9.
In the other bracket, Kentucky hosts Dartmouth.
The winners and losers play the next day. Kentucky
is obviously favored, despite problems in the pivot,
because of hot-shooting Kevin Grevey, a 6-5 junior
forward who averaged over 30 points per game in

his last six games last season and also played with
Kelley in China.
After the Kentucky tourney, the Cardinals fly
to New York, where they'll enjoy Christmas dinner.
The players will have to get their minds off the
showgirls pretty fast, however, as the opening test
with LaSalle should be a rough one.
The Explorers have beaten Army, Lehigh and
Hofstra in compiling a 3-0 record so far. The team
has good veteran cornermen and a reportedly-tough
Philadelphia center, 6-10 sophomore Joe Bryant.
After LaSalle, Stanford faces the winner or loser
of the Manhattan-St. Louis game. The other bracket
includes Illinois, Dusquene, St. John's and
Princeton.
Coach Howie Dallmar welcomes his team's visit
to the colder sections of the U.S. "They're both
very outstanding tournaments, both in the way
they're run and in the teams involved. It'll be good
to play teams from other sections of the country."
Currently, LaSalle and Ohio State, the Cards'
certain foes, and Kentucky and St. Johns, potential
foes, are all ranked among the "others" in the
Associated Press basketball poll. Chances are that by
the end of the vacation, one of these teams — or
maybe even Stanford — will have cracked the top
20.

YOU'VE GOT TO BE KlDDlNG—Stanford's Mike Mann is obviously
suffering considerable pain on this play, but the foul was called on
Mann, not USF's Eric Fernsten (41). Despite the officiating blunder,
Stanford defeated the Dons, 63-61.
