# Holiday Travels End In Consolation
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
NEW YORK — Including the ushers,
policemen, vendors, players, coaches and
referees, there were about 150 people on
hand for last Saturday's game between
Stanford and St. Louis. Tip-off was 10:30
a.m., and when the public address
announcer said, "Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen, and welcome to the magic
world of Madison Square Garden Center,"
the familiar words sounded strangely
hollow as they echoed off 19,350 empty
seats.
That was the conclusion to Stanford's
10-day basketball vacation — a trip that
included stops at the Kentucky Classic and
the ECAC Holiday Festival. "Do you
realize if [Rich] Kelley didn't foul out of
those games we might have won the whole
thing," a frustrated Howie Dallmar sighed as
the weary team neared home.
But instead of winning them both, the
trip ended at that ungodly hour amidst all
those empty seats. The indignity of it all.
Nevertheless, it ended in victory, as the
Cards defeated St. Louis, 79-63, in
Saturday's morning's appropriately labeled
"consolation" game. And despite a
succession of ill-timed referees' whistles
that continually sent Kelley to the
sidelines, Stanford's record stands at a
respectable 5-3 going into this weekend's
Pacific Eight openers against Oregon and
Oregon State.
Unique Situations
"The trip was good for us," Dallmar
said. "We played in some unique situations
and the experience has to help — we always
emphasize the conference."
Now that the league season has arrived,
Dallmar is keeping his fingers crossed.
"Rich just has to realize that unnecessary
fouling cannot occur," he said. "With his
enthusiasm, he tries to do too much, and
sometimes a needless foul is the result. .. .
He's just too valuable."
Valuable is an understatement. Kelley
has fouled out of five games so far,
including all three Cardinal losses. He left
the Nevada-Reno game with 2:56
remaining, fouled out against Kentucky
with 5:32 left and exited against La Salle
with 10:15 remaining.
Each time Stanford seemed on the verge
of victory. But each time Kelley's absence
demoralized his teammates and revitalized
the opposition. And each time Stanford
wound up a very frustrated loser.
Kelley has managed to average 17.3
points and 11.9 rebounds despite the
limited playing time. And if it hadn't been
for those fateful whistles....

Willard and Wayne Smith are a pair of
twins well versed in a peculiar sort of
Southern hospitality. The Smith brothers
are gracious hosts when visitors are merely
tangling among themselves in Bluegrass
country. But when those visitors dare to
defy the Kentucky Wildcats, Wayne and
Wiliard don their striped officials' shirts
and suddenly become as vicious as
Kentucky's fanatic fans.
The Smith brothers were quite friendly
and quite fair when Stanford met Ohio
State in the opening round of the
Kentucky Classic. Fouls were called on
both teams, and the Cardinals triumphed

68-53 mainly because Dave Frost and Tim
Patterson each scored 18 points. Buckeye
coach Fred Taylor was angry after the
game, but not at the referees. He was
simply mad at his own starters, four of
whom he replaced for the following night's
consolation game.
No Justice
But Saturday night, Howie Dallmar was
the loser, and he was very mad at the
Smiths. Stanford lost 78-77 to the host
Kentuckians and the Cards "committed"
28 fouls, compared to only 17 for the
Wildcats. Tim Patterson fouled out with
6:52 remaining, Kelley exited with 5:32
left and Dave Frost fouled out two minutes
later.
But that's not what Dallmar was mad
about. Following Frost's alleged fifth foul,
the 6-6 foward writhed on the floor and
screamed obscenities at Wayne and Willard.
The Smiths didn't respond. But when Frost
calmly walked to the bench and asked one
of the twins if the basket counted, he was

immediately slapped with a technical.
"It's ridiculous to have an important
game like that determined by a technical
foul we didn't deserve," Dallmar said.
The nightmarish finish unfortunately
obscured a magnificent performance by
Kelley. He scored 26 points, grabbed a
career-high 27 rebounds and was named to
the All-Tournament team.
But for Kelley, the statistics and honors
were of little consolation. "We were
robbed," he said as the stunned Cardinals
arrived in New York.
♦ * *
The Big City greeted Stanford with
headlines that proclaimed the Cards
"second best in the West." The word
around New York was that St. John's
would emerge as the lower bracket finalist,
and the Stanford-La Salle winner was a
cinch in the upper bracket of the
eight-team tourney. Explorer coach Paul
Westhead was particularly confident.
"Whoever wins this game will win the

tournament," Westhead said on the eve of
the 22nd annual event.
Westhead turned out to be dead wrong
(Manhattan eventually won), and so was
the New York press — twice. The same
newspapers that called Stanford "second
best in the West" (maybe in a few weeks,
but right now it's hard to ignore USC and
Long Beach State), a day later said the
Cards were "some very tall, very slow
trees."
The cause of all this mind-changing was
a 77-66 La Salle victory in the opening
round — a contest that ranked right up
there with the Kentucky game on
Dallmar's nightmare list.
Stanford was shaky from the start ("We
played with tenseness — there was no
excuse for it," Dallmar said). Still, the
Cards managed to open up an early 16-8
lead against the equally nervous Explorers.
But Kelley was charged with three fouls
before the score changed and left the game
for 10 minutes.
Closed The Gap
With Kelley out, Stanford maintained
its height advantage and temporarily kept
La Salle awe-struck. ("What scared me,"
said Explorer center Joe Bryant, no midget
himself at 6-10, "was that they would take
out a seven-foot guy and put in somebody
6-11. When I came out on the floor, I said
to myself, 'God, what did I ever get myself
into.' ") But La Salle gradually closed the
gap and led 33-31 at halftime.
In the second half, Stanford started
strong and threatened to pull away. Once
the Cards led by seven, and twice they
built six-point margins. But with 10:15
remaining, disaster struck. Kelley turned to
block a La Salle shot and cautiously
aborted the ball's flight. "I didn't touch
him," he said later, but at the tirfte he
could only grimace and walk dejectedly to
the bench with five fouls.
Patterson's fifth foul came four minutes
later, and the Cards were unable to
maintain control. A brilliant 26-oint effort
by Dave Frost was wasted, and Dallmar's
thoughts turned from fictories to ironies.
"It's a funny thing," he said. "Coming
into the tournament our strength was our
depth. But all of a sudden three of our big
guys are on the bench [Kelley and
Patterson with five fouls and Mike Mann
with a bruised knee] and our strength
turns out to be our weakness."
* * *
Now, as the Cards begin their idealistic
assault on the Pac-8 championship and set
their realistic goals toward second place,
Dallmar thinks he has a better conception
of Stanford's strengths.
Dave Frost, who scored 88 points in
Stanford's last five games "has played
really outstanding basketball," and the
still questionable backcourt was "more
consistent" in the consolation victory over
St. Louis. The combination of Melvin
Arterberry and Mark Gilberg was poised
and aggressive, if not explosive offensively.
Tim Patterson and Ed Scheitzer have
continued to play extremely well, and
Kelley is only whistles away from
greatness. "He has all the tools," Boston
Celtics coach Tommy Heinsohn said in
New York. "Great players find a way not
to foul out, but it's only a matter of time."

to myself, 'God, what did I ever get myself
into.' ") But La Salle gradually closed the
gap and led 33-31 at halftime.
In the second half, Stanford started
strong and threatened to pull away. Once
the Cards led by seven, and twice they
built six-point margins. But with 10:15
remaining, disaster struck. Kelley turned to
block a La Salle shot and cautiously
aborted the ball's flight. "I didn't touch
him," he said later, but at the tirfte he
could only grimace and walk dejectedly to
the bench with five fouls.
Patterson's fifth foul came four minutes
later, and the Cards were unable to
maintain control. A brilliant 26-oint effort
by Dave Frost was wasted, and Dallmar's
thoughts turned from fictories to ironies.
"It's a funny thing," he said. "Coming

depth. But all of a sudden three of our big
guys are on the bench [Kelley and
Patterson with five fouls and Mike Mann
with a bruised knee] and our strength
turns out to be our weakness."

Now, as the Cards begin their idealistic
assault on the Pac-8 championship and set
their realistic goals toward second place,
Dallmar thinks he has a better conception
of Stanford's strengths.
Dave Frost, who scored 88 points in
Stanford's last five games "has played
really outstanding basketball," and the
still questionable backcourt was "more
consistent" in the consolation victory over
St. Louis. The combination of Melvin
Arterberry and Mark Gilberg was poised
and aggressive, if not explosive offensively.
Tim Patterson and Ed Scheitzer have
continued to play extremely well, and
Kelley is only whistles away from
greatness. "He has all the tools," Boston

New York. "Great players find a way not

HOLIDAY DESPIAR—Tim Patterson (55) and Rich Kelley watch helplessly as La
Salle's Joe Bryant (30) tips in a basket in the opening round of the ECAC Holiday
Festival at Madison Square Garden. The Explorers defeated the Cards, 77-66.
NEW YORK — Including the ushers,
policemen, vendors, players, coaches and
referees, there were about 150 people on
hand for last Saturday's game between
Stanford and St. Louis. Tip-off was 10:30
a.m., and when the public address
announcer said, "Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen, and welcome to the magic
world of Madison Square Garden Center,"
the familiar words sounded strangely
hollow as they echoed off 19,350 empty
seats.
That was the conclusion to Stanford's
10-day basketball vacation — a trip that
included stops at the Kentucky Classic and
the ECAC Holiday Festival. "Do you
realize if [Rich] Kelley didn't foul out of
those games we might have won the whole
thing," a frustrated Howie Dallmar sighed as
the weary team neared home.
But instead of winning them both, the
trip ended at that ungodly hour amidst all
those empty seats. The indignity of it all.
Nevertheless, it ended in victory, as the
Cards defeated St. Louis, 79-63, in
Saturday's morning's appropriately labeled
"consolation" game. And despite a
succession of ill-timed referees' whistles
that continually sent Kelley to the
sidelines, Stanford's record stands at a
respectable 5-3 going into this weekend's
Pacific Eight openers against Oregon and
Oregon State.
Unique Situations
"The trip was good for us," Dallmar
said. "We played in some unique situations
and the experience has to help — we always
emphasize the conference."
Now that the league season has arrived,
Dallmar is keeping his fingers crossed.
"Rich just has to realize that unnecessary
fouling cannot occur," he said. "With his
enthusiasm, he tries to do too much, and
sometimes a needless foul is the result. .. .
He's just too valuable."
Valuable is an understatement. Kelley
has fouled out of five games so far,
including all three Cardinal losses. He left
the Nevada-Reno game with 2:56
remaining, fouled out against Kentucky
with 5:32 left and exited against La Salle
with 10:15 remaining.
Each time Stanford seemed on the verge
of victory. But each time Kelley's absence
demoralized his teammates and revitalized
the opposition. And each time Stanford
wound up a very frustrated loser.
Kelley has managed to average 17.3
points and 11.9 rebounds despite the
limited playing time. And if it hadn't been
for those fateful whistles....

Willard and Wayne Smith are a pair of
twins well versed in a peculiar sort of
Southern hospitality. The Smith brothers
are gracious hosts when visitors are merely
tangling among themselves in Bluegrass
country. But when those visitors dare to
defy the Kentucky Wildcats, Wayne and
Wiliard don their striped officials' shirts
and suddenly become as vicious as
Kentucky's fanatic fans.
The Smith brothers were quite friendly
and quite fair when Stanford met Ohio
State in the opening round of the
Kentucky Classic. Fouls were called on
both teams, and the Cardinals triumphed

68-53 mainly because Dave Frost and Tim
Patterson each scored 18 points. Buckeye
coach Fred Taylor was angry after the
game, but not at the referees. He was
simply mad at his own starters, four of
whom he replaced for the following night's
consolation game.
No Justice
But Saturday night, Howie Dallmar was
the loser, and he was very mad at the
Smiths. Stanford lost 78-77 to the host
Kentuckians and the Cards "committed"
28 fouls, compared to only 17 for the
Wildcats. Tim Patterson fouled out with
6:52 remaining, Kelley exited with 5:32
left and Dave Frost fouled out two minutes
later.
But that's not what Dallmar was mad
about. Following Frost's alleged fifth foul,
the 6-6 foward writhed on the floor and
screamed obscenities at Wayne and Willard.
The Smiths didn't respond. But when Frost
calmly walked to the bench and asked one
of the twins if the basket counted, he was

immediately slapped with a technical.
"It's ridiculous to have an important
game like that determined by a technical
foul we didn't deserve," Dallmar said.
The nightmarish finish unfortunately
obscured a magnificent performance by
Kelley. He scored 26 points, grabbed a
career-high 27 rebounds and was named to
the All-Tournament team.
But for Kelley, the statistics and honors
were of little consolation. "We were
robbed," he said as the stunned Cardinals
arrived in New York.
♦ * *
The Big City greeted Stanford with
headlines that proclaimed the Cards
"second best in the West." The word
around New York was that St. John's
would emerge as the lower bracket finalist,
and the Stanford-La Salle winner was a
cinch in the upper bracket of the
eight-team tourney. Explorer coach Paul
Westhead was particularly confident.
"Whoever wins this game will win the

tournament," Westhead said on the eve of
the 22nd annual event.
Westhead turned out to be dead wrong
(Manhattan eventually won), and so was
the New York press — twice. The same
newspapers that called Stanford "second
best in the West" (maybe in a few weeks,
but right now it's hard to ignore USC and
Long Beach State), a day later said the
Cards were "some very tall, very slow
trees."
The cause of all this mind-changing was
a 77-66 La Salle victory in the opening
round — a contest that ranked right up
there with the Kentucky game on
Dallmar's nightmare list.
Stanford was shaky from the start ("We
played with tenseness — there was no
excuse for it," Dallmar said). Still, the
Cards managed to open up an early 16-8
lead against the equally nervous Explorers.
But Kelley was charged with three fouls
before the score changed and left the game
for 10 minutes.
Closed The Gap
With Kelley out, Stanford maintained
its height advantage and temporarily kept
La Salle awe-struck. ("What scared me,"
said Explorer center Joe Bryant, no midget
himself at 6-10, "was that they would take
out a seven-foot guy and put in somebody
6-11. When I came out on the floor, I said
to myself, 'God, what did I ever get myself
into.' ") But La Salle gradually closed the
gap and led 33-31 at halftime.

The Big City greeted Stanford with

Westhead was particularly confident.
"Whoever wins this game will win the

tournament," Westhead said on the eve of

Westhead turned out to be dead wrong
(Manhattan eventually won), and so was
the New York press — twice. The same
newspapers that called Stanford "second
best in the West" (maybe in a few weeks,
but right now it's hard to ignore USC and
Long Beach State), a day later said the
Cards were "some very tall, very slow
trees."
The cause of all this mind-changing was
a 77-66 La Salle victory in the opening
round — a contest that ranked right up
there with the Kentucky game on
Dallmar's nightmare list.
Stanford was shaky from the start ("We
played with tenseness — there was no
excuse for it," Dallmar said). Still, the
Cards managed to open up an early 16-8
lead against the equally nervous Explorers.
But Kelley was charged with three fouls
before the score changed and left the game
for 10 minutes.
Closed The Gap
With Kelley out, Stanford maintained
its height advantage and temporarily kept
La Salle awe-struck. ("What scared me,"
said Explorer center Joe Bryant, no midget
himself at 6-10, "was that they would take
out a seven-foot guy and put in somebody
6-11. When I came out on the floor, I said
to myself, 'God, what did I ever get myself
into.' ") But La Salle gradually closed the
gap and led 33-31 at halftime.
In the second half, Stanford started
strong and threatened to pull away. Once
the Cards led by seven, and twice they
built six-point margins. But with 10:15
remaining, disaster struck. Kelley turned to
block a La Salle shot and cautiously
aborted the ball's flight. "I didn't touch
him," he said later, but at the tirfte he
could only grimace and walk dejectedly to
the bench with five fouls.
Patterson's fifth foul came four minutes
later, and the Cards were unable to
maintain control. A brilliant 26-oint effort
by Dave Frost was wasted, and Dallmar's
thoughts turned from fictories to ironies.
"It's a funny thing," he said. "Coming
into the tournament our strength was our
depth. But all of a sudden three of our big
guys are on the bench [Kelley and

with a bruised knee] and our strength
turns out to be our weakness."

Now, as the Cards begin their idealistic
assault on the Pac-8 championship and set
their realistic goals toward second place,
Dallmar thinks he has a better conception
of Stanford's strengths.
Dave Frost, who scored 88 points in
Stanford's last five games "has played
really outstanding basketball," and the
still questionable backcourt was "more
consistent" in the consolation victory over
St. Louis. The combination of Melvin
Arterberry and Mark Gilberg was poised
and aggressive, if not explosive offensively.
Tim Patterson and Ed Scheitzer have
continued to play extremely well, and
Kelley is only whistles away from
greatness. "He has all the tools," Boston

New York. "Great players find a way not

HOLIDAY DESPIAR—Tim Patterson (55) and Rich Kelley watch helplessly as La
Salle's Joe Bryant (30) tips in a basket in the opening round of the ECAC Holiday
Festival at Madison Square Garden. The Explorers defeated the Cards, 77-66.
NEW YORK — Including the ushers,
policemen, vendors, players, coaches and
referees, there were about 150 people on
hand for last Saturday's game between
Stanford and St. Louis. Tip-off was 10:30
a.m., and when the public address
announcer said, "Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen, and welcome to the magic
world of Madison Square Garden Center,"
the familiar words sounded strangely
hollow as they echoed off 19,350 empty
seats.
That was the conclusion to Stanford's
10-day basketball vacation — a trip that
included stops at the Kentucky Classic and
the ECAC Holiday Festival. "Do you
realize if [Rich] Kelley didn't foul out of
those games we might have won the whole
thing," a frustrated Howie Dallmar sighed as
the weary team neared home.
But instead of winning them both, the
trip ended at that ungodly hour amidst all
those empty seats. The indignity of it all.
Nevertheless, it ended in victory, as the
Cards defeated St. Louis, 79-63, in
Saturday's morning's appropriately labeled
"consolation" game. And despite a
succession of ill-timed referees' whistles
that continually sent Kelley to the
sidelines, Stanford's record stands at a
respectable 5-3 going into this weekend's
Pacific Eight openers against Oregon and
Oregon State.
Unique Situations
"The trip was good for us," Dallmar
said. "We played in some unique situations
and the experience has to help — we always
emphasize the conference."
Now that the league season has arrived,
Dallmar is keeping his fingers crossed.
"Rich just has to realize that unnecessary
fouling cannot occur," he said. "With his
enthusiasm, he tries to do too much, and
sometimes a needless foul is the result. .. .
He's just too valuable."
Valuable is an understatement. Kelley
has fouled out of five games so far,
including all three Cardinal losses. He left
the Nevada-Reno game with 2:56
remaining, fouled out against Kentucky
with 5:32 left and exited against La Salle
with 10:15 remaining.
Each time Stanford seemed on the verge
of victory. But each time Kelley's absence
demoralized his teammates and revitalized
the opposition. And each time Stanford
wound up a very frustrated loser.
Kelley has managed to average 17.3
points and 11.9 rebounds despite the
limited playing time. And if it hadn't been
for those fateful whistles....

Willard and Wayne Smith are a pair of
twins well versed in a peculiar sort of
Southern hospitality. The Smith brothers
are gracious hosts when visitors are merely
tangling among themselves in Bluegrass
country. But when those visitors dare to
defy the Kentucky Wildcats, Wayne and
Wiliard don their striped officials' shirts
and suddenly become as vicious as
Kentucky's fanatic fans.
The Smith brothers were quite friendly
and quite fair when Stanford met Ohio
State in the opening round of the
Kentucky Classic. Fouls were called on
both teams, and the Cardinals triumphed

68-53 mainly because Dave Frost and Tim
Patterson each scored 18 points. Buckeye
coach Fred Taylor was angry after the
game, but not at the referees. He was
simply mad at his own starters, four of
whom he replaced for the following night's
consolation game.
No Justice
But Saturday night, Howie Dallmar was
the loser, and he was very mad at the
Smiths. Stanford lost 78-77 to the host
Kentuckians and the Cards "committed"
28 fouls, compared to only 17 for the
Wildcats. Tim Patterson fouled out with
6:52 remaining, Kelley exited with 5:32
left and Dave Frost fouled out two minutes
later.
But that's not what Dallmar was mad
about. Following Frost's alleged fifth foul,
the 6-6 foward writhed on the floor and
screamed obscenities at Wayne and Willard.
The Smiths didn't respond. But when Frost
calmly walked to the bench and asked one
of the twins if the basket counted, he was

immediately slapped with a technical.
"It's ridiculous to have an important
game like that determined by a technical
foul we didn't deserve," Dallmar said.

Valuable is an understatement. Kelley
has fouled out of five games so far,
including all three Cardinal losses. He left
the Nevada-Reno game with 2:56
remaining, fouled out against Kentucky
with 5:32 left and exited against La Salle
with 10:15 remaining.
Each time Stanford seemed on the verge
of victory. But each time Kelley's absence
demoralized his teammates and revitalized
the opposition. And each time Stanford
wound up a very frustrated loser.
Kelley has managed to average 17.3
points and 11.9 rebounds despite the
limited playing time. And if it hadn't been

Willard and Wayne Smith are a pair of
twins well versed in a peculiar sort of
Southern hospitality. The Smith brothers
are gracious hosts when visitors are merely
tangling among themselves in Bluegrass
country. But when those visitors dare to
defy the Kentucky Wildcats, Wayne and
Wiliard don their striped officials' shirts
and suddenly become as vicious as
Kentucky's fanatic fans.
The Smith brothers were quite friendly
and quite fair when Stanford met Ohio
State in the opening round of the
Kentucky Classic. Fouls were called on
both teams, and the Cardinals triumphed

68-53 mainly because Dave Frost and Tim
Patterson each scored 18 points. Buckeye
coach Fred Taylor was angry after the
game, but not at the referees. He was
simply mad at his own starters, four of
whom he replaced for the following night's
consolation game.
No Justice
But Saturday night, Howie Dallmar was
the loser, and he was very mad at the
Smiths. Stanford lost 78-77 to the host
Kentuckians and the Cards "committed"
28 fouls, compared to only 17 for the
Wildcats. Tim Patterson fouled out with
6:52 remaining, Kelley exited with 5:32
left and Dave Frost fouled out two minutes
later.
But that's not what Dallmar was mad
about. Following Frost's alleged fifth foul,
the 6-6 foward writhed on the floor and
screamed obscenities at Wayne and Willard.
The Smiths didn't respond. But when Frost
calmly walked to the bench and asked one
of the twins if the basket counted, he was

immediately slapped with a technical.
"It's ridiculous to have an important
game like that determined by a technical
foul we didn't deserve," Dallmar said.
The nightmarish finish unfortunately
obscured a magnificent performance by
Kelley. He scored 26 points, grabbed a
career-high 27 rebounds and was named to
the All-Tournament team.
But for Kelley, the statistics and honors
were of little consolation. "We were
robbed," he said as the stunned Cardinals
arrived in New York.

The Big City greeted Stanford with
headlines that proclaimed the Cards
"second best in the West." The word
around New York was that St. John's
would emerge as the lower bracket finalist,
and the Stanford-La Salle winner was a
cinch in the upper bracket of the
eight-team tourney. Explorer coach Paul
Westhead was particularly confident.
"Whoever wins this game will win the

tournament," Westhead said on the eve of
the 22nd annual event.
Westhead turned out to be dead wrong
(Manhattan eventually won), and so was
the New York press — twice. The same
newspapers that called Stanford "second
best in the West" (maybe in a few weeks,
but right now it's hard to ignore USC and
Long Beach State), a day later said the
Cards were "some very tall, very slow
trees."
The cause of all this mind-changing was
a 77-66 La Salle victory in the opening
round — a contest that ranked right up
there with the Kentucky game on
Dallmar's nightmare list.
Stanford was shaky from the start ("We
played with tenseness — there was no
excuse for it," Dallmar said). Still, the
Cards managed to open up an early 16-8
lead against the equally nervous Explorers.
But Kelley was charged with three fouls
before the score changed and left the game
for 10 minutes.
Closed The Gap
With Kelley out, Stanford maintained
its height advantage and temporarily kept
La Salle awe-struck. ("What scared me,"
said Explorer center Joe Bryant, no midget
himself at 6-10, "was that they would take
out a seven-foot guy and put in somebody
6-11. When I came out on the floor, I said
to myself, 'God, what did I ever get myself
into.' ") But La Salle gradually closed the
gap and led 33-31 at halftime.
In the second half, Stanford started
strong and threatened to pull away. Once
the Cards led by seven, and twice they
built six-point margins. But with 10:15
remaining, disaster struck. Kelley turned to
block a La Salle shot and cautiously
aborted the ball's flight. "I didn't touch
him," he said later, but at the tirfte he
could only grimace and walk dejectedly to
the bench with five fouls.
Patterson's fifth foul came four minutes
later, and the Cards were unable to
maintain control. A brilliant 26-oint effort
by Dave Frost was wasted, and Dallmar's
thoughts turned from fictories to ironies.
"It's a funny thing," he said. "Coming
into the tournament our strength was our
depth. But all of a sudden three of our big
guys are on the bench [Kelley and
Patterson with five fouls and Mike Mann
with a bruised knee] and our strength
turns out to be our weakness."
* * *
Now, as the Cards begin their idealistic
assault on the Pac-8 championship and set
their realistic goals toward second place,
Dallmar thinks he has a better conception
of Stanford's strengths.
Dave Frost, who scored 88 points in
Stanford's last five games "has played
really outstanding basketball," and the
still questionable backcourt was "more
consistent" in the consolation victory over
St. Louis. The combination of Melvin
Arterberry and Mark Gilberg was poised
and aggressive, if not explosive offensively.
Tim Patterson and Ed Scheitzer have
continued to play extremely well, and
Kelley is only whistles away from
greatness. "He has all the tools," Boston
Celtics coach Tommy Heinsohn said in
New York. "Great players find a way not
to foul out, but it's only a matter of time."

HOLIDAY DESPIAR—Tim Patterson (55) and Rich Kelley watch helplessly as La
Salle's Joe Bryant (30) tips in a basket in the opening round of the ECAC Holiday
Festival at Madison Square Garden. The Explorers defeated the Cards, 77-66.
NEW YORK — Including the ushers,
policemen, vendors, players, coaches and
referees, there were about 150 people on
hand for last Saturday's game between
Stanford and St. Louis. Tip-off was 10:30
a.m., and when the public address
announcer said, "Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen, and welcome to the magic
world of Madison Square Garden Center,"
the familiar words sounded strangely
hollow as they echoed off 19,350 empty
seats.
That was the conclusion to Stanford's
10-day basketball vacation — a trip that
included stops at the Kentucky Classic and
the ECAC Holiday Festival. "Do you
realize if [Rich] Kelley didn't foul out of
those games we might have won the whole
thing," a frustrated Howie Dallmar sighed as
the weary team neared home.
But instead of winning them both, the
trip ended at that ungodly hour amidst all
those empty seats. The indignity of it all.
Nevertheless, it ended in victory, as the
Cards defeated St. Louis, 79-63, in
Saturday's morning's appropriately labeled
"consolation" game. And despite a
succession of ill-timed referees' whistles
that continually sent Kelley to the
sidelines, Stanford's record stands at a
respectable 5-3 going into this weekend's
Pacific Eight openers against Oregon and
Oregon State.
Unique Situations
"The trip was good for us," Dallmar
said. "We played in some unique situations
and the experience has to help — we always
emphasize the conference."
Now that the league season has arrived,
Dallmar is keeping his fingers crossed.
"Rich just has to realize that unnecessary
fouling cannot occur," he said. "With his
enthusiasm, he tries to do too much, and
sometimes a needless foul is the result. .. .
He's just too valuable."
Valuable is an understatement. Kelley
has fouled out of five games so far,
