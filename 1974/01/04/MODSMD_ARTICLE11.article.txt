# Defense Is The Game For Unsung Arterberry
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
NEW YORK - Melvin
Arterberry streaked to the
baseline, stopped suddenly, faced
the basket and leaped. The ball
was poised on his fingertips, and
he gently released it from 22 feet
away. It rose in a smooth arc and
softly rippled the net as it
dropped through the basket.
The scene was Madison Square
Garden and the field goal helped
Stanford defeat St. Louis, but it
could have been any guard on any
court for any modern team. Every
guard, it seems, shoots long
baseline jumpers.
But when Arterberry sank his
22-footer, Stanford's players were
at first disbelieving, then
delighted. Melvin Arterberry, you
see, is not any modem guard. He
rarely shoots from past 15 feet
out and rarely scores from beyond
10. In these days of Pistol Pete,
ABA three-pointers and run and
gun — mostly gun — basketball,
Melvin Arterberry is an
anachronism. His game is defense.
"The way I look at it,"he says,
•'if you score 20 and your man
scores 25, you're not helping the
team."
And Arterberry, whose scoring
average is a modest 5.5 points per

game and whose shooting
percentages are too embarrassing
to print twice in the same issue
(see page 2), indeed helps the
team.
'Gets The Ball'
"Melvin's the quickest player
we have," says Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar. "He's an
outstanding defensive guard and
he always seems to get us the
ball."
Arterberry realizes his
limitations, and knows how he
can best contribute to a front
line-oriented tream. "My main
responsibility is to play good
defense and keep the offense
moving," he says.
When the Cards are playing
man-to-man, he is always assigned
to the opponent's best offensive
guard. Some of his toughest
assignments have been USF's Phil
Smith, UCLA's Larry Hollyfield
and Oregon's explosive Ron Lee.
Friday night, Arterberry and Lee
will again be involved in a crucial
matchup.
"It's a challenge," Arterberry
said. "Lee's strong, quick — he's a
good shooter and good all-around
player. He handles the ball a lot,
and that puts pressure on the
defender. I'm looking forward to
it."
Prep Standout
Arterberry has been looking
forward to defensive challenges
since high school, when he starred
for Crenshaw's Los Angeles City
champions. Melvin earned first
team All-City honors, partly
because of his 15 point scoring
average, but mainly because he
was instrumental in holding
opposing teams to less than 40
points a game.
He played forward that year,
and was a front-line starter on the
1971-72 Indian freshman squad.
That team finished with a 16-3
record, primarily because of some
explosive fast breaks. Rich Kelley
would snare the ball off the board
and toss the outlet pass to Mark
Gilberg, who would flip deft
passes to Arterberry, streaking
toward the basket for a sure two
points.

"Melvin is unstoppable going
to the basket," says forward Tim
Patterson. "He goes to the hoop
with controlled abandon."
Now Arterberry is a guard, a
switch necessitated by his height
(6-3V&). And the transition, at
least defensively, has been almost
effortless. "It wasn't hard for me
to play defense against guards,"
he said. "I always guarded quicker
forwards. Offensively, though, it's
taken time to make the
adjustment. In high school I
played with my back to the
basket, but now I have to face the
basket and handle the ball more."
And shoot from the outside.
Confidence
"I know I'm a better shooter
than I've shown," he insists. "It's
just a matter of confidence. I'm
feeling more comfortable now,
but it's tough because defenders
don't respect my outside shot.
Once I start hitting, it should
open up for some drives."
Until things do open up,
Arterberry is content to
quarterback the team, play
defense, grab long rebounds,
snatch loose balls and steady the
team with his quiet leadership.
"Melvin doesn't say much, but
he takes charge," says Patterson.
"And he keeps the team together
because he's so unselfish."
Right now, Melvin is primarily
interested in helping the Cards
win Pac-8 basketball games
("Even UCLA can be beaten," he
says), but in his spare time he is
working toward an economics
major and continuing to perfect
his musical talents — skills which
rank second only to defense.
"I've played the piano for 12
years," he says,"and the
saxaphone for six. And I've
dabbled in the organ, bass and
clarinet."
"Have you ever performed?"
he was asked.
"I've played piano in quite a
few recitals and played the sax in
some jazz concerts," he said, his
face assuming a sheepish grin.
It was almost as fun, it seemed,
as sinking 22-foot jump shots.

The scene was Madison Square
Garden and the field goal helped
Stanford defeat St. Louis, but it
could have been any guard on any
court for any modern team. Every
guard, it seems, shoots long
baseline jumpers.
But when Arterberry sank his
22-footer, Stanford's players were
at first disbelieving, then
delighted. Melvin Arterberry, you
see, is not any modem guard. He
rarely shoots from past 15 feet
out and rarely scores from beyond
10. In these days of Pistol Pete,
ABA three-pointers and run and
gun — mostly gun — basketball,
Melvin Arterberry is an
anachronism. His game is defense.
"The way I look at it,"he says,
•'if you score 20 and your man
scores 25, you're not helping the
team."
And Arterberry, whose scoring
average is a modest 5.5 points per

game and whose shooting
percentages are too embarrassing
to print twice in the same issue
(see page 2), indeed helps the
team.
'Gets The Ball'
"Melvin's the quickest player
we have," says Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar. "He's an
outstanding defensive guard and
he always seems to get us the
ball."
Arterberry realizes his
limitations, and knows how he
can best contribute to a front
line-oriented tream. "My main
responsibility is to play good
defense and keep the offense
moving," he says.
When the Cards are playing
man-to-man, he is always assigned
to the opponent's best offensive
guard. Some of his toughest
assignments have been USF's Phil
Smith, UCLA's Larry Hollyfield
and Oregon's explosive Ron Lee.
Friday night, Arterberry and Lee
will again be involved in a crucial
matchup.
"It's a challenge," Arterberry
said. "Lee's strong, quick — he's a
good shooter and good all-around
player. He handles the ball a lot,
and that puts pressure on the
defender. I'm looking forward to
it."
Prep Standout
Arterberry has been looking
forward to defensive challenges
since high school, when he starred
for Crenshaw's Los Angeles City
champions. Melvin earned first
team All-City honors, partly
because of his 15 point scoring
average, but mainly because he
was instrumental in holding
opposing teams to less than 40
points a game.
He played forward that year,
and was a front-line starter on the
1971-72 Indian freshman squad.
That team finished with a 16-3
record, primarily because of some
explosive fast breaks. Rich Kelley
would snare the ball off the board
and toss the outlet pass to Mark
Gilberg, who would flip deft
passes to Arterberry, streaking
toward the basket for a sure two
points.

"Melvin is unstoppable going
to the basket," says forward Tim
Patterson. "He goes to the hoop
with controlled abandon."
Now Arterberry is a guard, a
switch necessitated by his height
(6-3V&). And the transition, at
least defensively, has been almost
effortless. "It wasn't hard for me
to play defense against guards,"
he said. "I always guarded quicker
forwards. Offensively, though, it's
taken time to make the
adjustment. In high school I
played with my back to the
basket, but now I have to face the
basket and handle the ball more."
And shoot from the outside.
Confidence
"I know I'm a better shooter
than I've shown," he insists. "It's
just a matter of confidence. I'm
feeling more comfortable now,
but it's tough because defenders
don't respect my outside shot.
Once I start hitting, it should
open up for some drives."
Until things do open up,
Arterberry is content to
quarterback the team, play
defense, grab long rebounds,
snatch loose balls and steady the
team with his quiet leadership.
"Melvin doesn't say much, but
he takes charge," says Patterson.
"And he keeps the team together
because he's so unselfish."
Right now, Melvin is primarily
interested in helping the Cards
win Pac-8 basketball games
("Even UCLA can be beaten," he
says), but in his spare time he is
working toward an economics
major and continuing to perfect
his musical talents — skills which
rank second only to defense.
"I've played the piano for 12
years," he says,"and the
saxaphone for six. And I've
dabbled in the organ, bass and
clarinet."
"Have you ever performed?"
he was asked.
"I've played piano in quite a
few recitals and played the sax in
some jazz concerts," he said, his
face assuming a sheepish grin.
It was almost as fun, it seemed,
as sinking 22-foot jump shots.
NEW YORK - Melvin
Arterberry streaked to the
baseline, stopped suddenly, faced
the basket and leaped. The ball
was poised on his fingertips, and
he gently released it from 22 feet
away. It rose in a smooth arc and
softly rippled the net as it
dropped through the basket.

at first disbelieving, then
delighted. Melvin Arterberry, you
see, is not any modem guard. He
rarely shoots from past 15 feet
out and rarely scores from beyond
10. In these days of Pistol Pete,
ABA three-pointers and run and
gun — mostly gun — basketball,
Melvin Arterberry is an
anachronism. His game is defense.
"The way I look at it,"he says,
•'if you score 20 and your man
scores 25, you're not helping the
team."
And Arterberry, whose scoring
average is a modest 5.5 points per

game and whose shooting
percentages are too embarrassing
to print twice in the same issue
(see page 2), indeed helps the
team.
'Gets The Ball'
"Melvin's the quickest player
we have," says Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar. "He's an
outstanding defensive guard and
he always seems to get us the
ball."
Arterberry realizes his
limitations, and knows how he
can best contribute to a front
line-oriented tream. "My main
responsibility is to play good
defense and keep the offense
moving," he says.
When the Cards are playing
man-to-man, he is always assigned
to the opponent's best offensive
guard. Some of his toughest
assignments have been USF's Phil
Smith, UCLA's Larry Hollyfield
and Oregon's explosive Ron Lee.
Friday night, Arterberry and Lee
will again be involved in a crucial
matchup.
"It's a challenge," Arterberry
said. "Lee's strong, quick — he's a
good shooter and good all-around
player. He handles the ball a lot,
and that puts pressure on the
defender. I'm looking forward to
it."
Prep Standout
Arterberry has been looking
forward to defensive challenges
since high school, when he starred
for Crenshaw's Los Angeles City
champions. Melvin earned first
team All-City honors, partly
because of his 15 point scoring
average, but mainly because he
was instrumental in holding
opposing teams to less than 40
points a game.
He played forward that year,
and was a front-line starter on the
1971-72 Indian freshman squad.
That team finished with a 16-3
record, primarily because of some
explosive fast breaks. Rich Kelley
would snare the ball off the board
and toss the outlet pass to Mark
Gilberg, who would flip deft
passes to Arterberry, streaking
toward the basket for a sure two
points.

"Melvin is unstoppable going
to the basket," says forward Tim
Patterson. "He goes to the hoop
with controlled abandon."
Now Arterberry is a guard, a
switch necessitated by his height
(6-3V&). And the transition, at
least defensively, has been almost
effortless. "It wasn't hard for me
to play defense against guards,"
he said. "I always guarded quicker
forwards. Offensively, though, it's
taken time to make the
adjustment. In high school I
played with my back to the
basket, but now I have to face the
basket and handle the ball more."
And shoot from the outside.
Confidence
"I know I'm a better shooter
than I've shown," he insists. "It's
just a matter of confidence. I'm
feeling more comfortable now,
but it's tough because defenders
don't respect my outside shot.
Once I start hitting, it should
open up for some drives."
Until things do open up,
Arterberry is content to
quarterback the team, play
defense, grab long rebounds,
snatch loose balls and steady the
team with his quiet leadership.
"Melvin doesn't say much, but
he takes charge," says Patterson.
"And he keeps the team together
because he's so unselfish."
Right now, Melvin is primarily
interested in helping the Cards
win Pac-8 basketball games
("Even UCLA can be beaten," he
says), but in his spare time he is
working toward an economics
major and continuing to perfect
his musical talents — skills which
rank second only to defense.
"I've played the piano for 12
years," he says,"and the
saxaphone for six. And I've
dabbled in the organ, bass and
clarinet."
"Have you ever performed?"
he was asked.
"I've played piano in quite a
few recitals and played the sax in
some jazz concerts," he said, his
face assuming a sheepish grin.
It was almost as fun, it seemed,
as sinking 22-foot jump shots.
NEW YORK - Melvin
Arterberry streaked to the
baseline, stopped suddenly, faced
the basket and leaped. The ball
was poised on his fingertips, and
he gently released it from 22 feet
away. It rose in a smooth arc and
softly rippled the net as it
dropped through the basket.
The scene was Madison Square
Garden and the field goal helped
Stanford defeat St. Louis, but it
could have been any guard on any
court for any modern team. Every
guard, it seems, shoots long
baseline jumpers.
