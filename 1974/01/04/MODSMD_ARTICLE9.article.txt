# Bad Example In Kentucky
## Will 'Homers' Mar Pac-8? 
### BRUCE KELLEY 
"Those two little +$%/&*!"was the only way
coach Howie Dallmar could really express his
thoughts in words.
Dallmar, normally a remarkably mild man, was
referring to Willard Smith and Wayne Smith, the
officials during Stanford's 78-77 loss to Kentucky in
the finals of the Kentucky Classic over the
Christmas holiday.
Willard and Wayne just happen to be twin
brothers who, against the Cards, hit a "homer," as
hometown-oriented refereeing is so affectionately
called.
Lexington's Memorial Coliseum, where Kentucky
plays its home games, is a perfect example of the
tremendous home court advantage that reigns in
most college basketball leagues.
In the last 34 years the Wildcats have lost only
35 games at home, while also dominating their own
tournament with 16 firsts in 21 years.
Holiday tornaments seem to be the hotbed of the
biased officiating that plagues college basketball.
This year Marquette, Hawaii, New Mexico, Detroit,
UCLA, Maryland and Kentucky won their own
tourneys, and Manhattan and Temple won
tournaments right in their backyards.
Capacity Crowds
Constant capacity crowds of 12,000 was the real
reason behind the favorable officiating that host
Kentucky received at Lexington.
Assistant coach Bub Bowling explains, "You've

got 11,992 rabid, and I mean RABID, Kentucky
fans who react loudly to ever call, and eight
Stanford people who think they're the only sane
people in the place. In this situation, where the
Kentucky tradition demands winning, officials tend
to lose objectivity."
Willard and Wayne also officiated Stanford's
opening round win against Ohio State, and, because
it was a neutral court, had done a pretty good job.
When Dallmar and Bowling were given a choice of
refs for the final, they chose the twins because the
other pair "had been thoroughly intimidated by the
crowd in Kentucky's opening round win and we
didn't want any part of them," according to
Bowling.
"We figured a pair of tough southerners like
Willard and Wayne would be courageous and do a
good job. We were wrong."
Bowling feels "the Pac-B's method of insuring a
school's recommending power and stopping
'homers' works well." At least three days after each
league game (to provide them with time to cool off)
the coaches grade the officials on a 1 to 5 basis.
Reward And Punishment
At the end of the year the highest rated officials
are rewarded with the NCAA finals and other high
paying post-year games. All 24 officials are then
listed by how well they did during the year, with
their rank affecting the importance and difficulty of
the games they are assigned during the next season.
So, as Bowling puts it,"the refs are forced to try
to please both coaches. This eliminates the chance
of getting a 'homer' as bad as we did at Kentucky."
Still, Washington State, Oregon and UCLA have
well-earned reputations of having gyms where
officials can be swayed.
Another reputation that will affect the Pac-8
officiating this year is Oregon's often-labeled
"dirty" tactics. The Ducks, Stanford's Friday night
opponent, were continually blasted by opposing
coaches last year because their coach, Dick Harter,
teaches his players various intimidating actions, like
tackling opponents moving in for open layups.
Officials were continually charged with letting
Oregon's home games "get out of their control," a
condition that Bowling really emphasizes.
"All we ask is that the refs have guts and
courage. They've got to call them exactly as they
see them and not back down on close calls."

referring to Willard Smith and Wayne Smith, the
officials during Stanford's 78-77 loss to Kentucky in
the finals of the Kentucky Classic over the
Christmas holiday.
Willard and Wayne just happen to be twin
brothers who, against the Cards, hit a "homer," as
hometown-oriented refereeing is so affectionately
called.
Lexington's Memorial Coliseum, where Kentucky
plays its home games, is a perfect example of the
tremendous home court advantage that reigns in
most college basketball leagues.
In the last 34 years the Wildcats have lost only
35 games at home, while also dominating their own
tournament with 16 firsts in 21 years.
Holiday tornaments seem to be the hotbed of the
biased officiating that plagues college basketball.
This year Marquette, Hawaii, New Mexico, Detroit,
UCLA, Maryland and Kentucky won their own
tourneys, and Manhattan and Temple won
tournaments right in their backyards.
Capacity Crowds
Constant capacity crowds of 12,000 was the real
reason behind the favorable officiating that host
Kentucky received at Lexington.
Assistant coach Bub Bowling explains, "You've

got 11,992 rabid, and I mean RABID, Kentucky
fans who react loudly to ever call, and eight
Stanford people who think they're the only sane
people in the place. In this situation, where the
Kentucky tradition demands winning, officials tend
to lose objectivity."
Willard and Wayne also officiated Stanford's
opening round win against Ohio State, and, because
it was a neutral court, had done a pretty good job.
When Dallmar and Bowling were given a choice of
refs for the final, they chose the twins because the
other pair "had been thoroughly intimidated by the
crowd in Kentucky's opening round win and we
didn't want any part of them," according to
Bowling.
"We figured a pair of tough southerners like
Willard and Wayne would be courageous and do a
good job. We were wrong."
Bowling feels "the Pac-B's method of insuring a
school's recommending power and stopping
'homers' works well." At least three days after each
league game (to provide them with time to cool off)
the coaches grade the officials on a 1 to 5 basis.
Reward And Punishment
At the end of the year the highest rated officials
are rewarded with the NCAA finals and other high
paying post-year games. All 24 officials are then
listed by how well they did during the year, with
their rank affecting the importance and difficulty of
the games they are assigned during the next season.
So, as Bowling puts it,"the refs are forced to try
to please both coaches. This eliminates the chance
of getting a 'homer' as bad as we did at Kentucky."
Still, Washington State, Oregon and UCLA have
well-earned reputations of having gyms where
officials can be swayed.
Another reputation that will affect the Pac-8
officiating this year is Oregon's often-labeled
"dirty" tactics. The Ducks, Stanford's Friday night
opponent, were continually blasted by opposing
coaches last year because their coach, Dick Harter,
teaches his players various intimidating actions, like
tackling opponents moving in for open layups.
Officials were continually charged with letting
Oregon's home games "get out of their control," a
condition that Bowling really emphasizes.
"All we ask is that the refs have guts and
courage. They've got to call them exactly as they
see them and not back down on close calls."
"Those two little +$%/&*!"was the only way
coach Howie Dallmar could really express his
thoughts in words.
Dallmar, normally a remarkably mild man, was
referring to Willard Smith and Wayne Smith, the
officials during Stanford's 78-77 loss to Kentucky in
the finals of the Kentucky Classic over the
