# Sperm Solicitation Lures Prospective Donors
## 
### ROB QUICK First Of Two Parts 
People are always asking for
contributions: money, time, old
♦lothes, sperm ... yes, even sperm. An
idvertisement appeared recently in the
Daily soliciting donations from
Stanford males. A hundred freshmen
ind sophomores answered the ad,
jresumably lured by the $30 offered
'or eac'i sperm specimen, but none
lave yet qualified as donors.
Dr. Eugene Finkle, a San Carlos
(ynecologist and president of
Reproductive Systems, an artificial
risemination research firm, is
learching for sperm donors whose seed
vill be used to inseminate women
vhose husbands are infertile.
According to Arlene Demaret,
Tinkle's assistant, "We received 100
requests for information from the ad.
iome 50 students returned our initial
|uestionnaire. Of these, we considered
15 to be qualified as potential donors.
»o far, we have tested three of the 15,
ind all three have been rejected."
"We set extremely high standards,"
Tinkle explains. "We should strive for
;he most perfect. If we are unable to
jet a cadre of people who meet certain
jharacteristics, then of course we'll
lave to lower our standards."
Standards
Finkle's standards are based on a
igorous series of 20 tests which rate
ntelligence, physical condition and
jsychological well-being.
"Given a choice," he maintains,
'why should one accept a nearsighted
Jonor in spite of all other beneficial
jharacteristics? If we're going to do

this, we should do t right."
In his search fci intelligent donors,
Finkle is staying within the Stanford
community. Another gynecologist and
practitioner of artificial insemination
in Palo Alto, wishes to remain
anonymous, has had fewer problems in
finding donors.
Med Students
The doctor uses Stanford medical
students. They are tested only for
genetic defects, genetically
transmittable diseases, blood type and
sperm count. Intelligence is assumed.
Finkle, too, used to depend on
Stanford medical students as donors,
but problems in finding willing
participants and making appointments
with these busy students forced him to
look elsewhere.
At present, Finkle is combing the
undergraduate population for students
who will be in the area for the next
few years. Now, he maintains, he
inseminates on a "more scientific
basis." He states flatly, "Prospective

donors deserve the best screening
modern science can give."
The other Palo Alto doctor agrees
that "the most difficult part of
therapeutic insemination is donor
selection. It is a tremendous
responsibility."
Shoots Blanks
This responsibility involves turning
down unqualified donors. To this end,
Finkle explains, "The first thing we do
is examine the sperm specimen. If
someone comes in and shoots blanks,
obviously we can't use it"and —and the
donor is not paid for the sample.
On the other hand, a donor who is
accepted may be asked to contribute
his sperm as often as it is needed —
usually no more than a few times a
year — and is paid for each effort.
Finkle pays $30 for each sample
because "with inflation $30 seems to
be about right," he figures. He was
paid $20 for the same service as a
medical student and donor 30 years
ago.

The $30 may seei.i rather high, but
actually the money does not come
without some sacrifice. The sperm
count of each specumen must exceed
90 percent of the donor's norm, which
means that he "must be continent for
at least 48 hours before he produces
the specimen," Finkle explains.
Other than this requirement, the
insemination process is simple. Finkle
puts it bluntly: the donor "produces
the specimen by masturbation and
delivers it to us."
The sperm is then taken to Sequoia
Hospital, and within three hours the
woman is inseminated.
Finkle always uses this fresh sperm
method as opposed to freezing and
storage techniques, where the sperm is
thawed just prior to use.
"I didn't go the sperm bank route,"
Finkle says, "because I don't think the
possible long range genetic
implications have been worked out
yet. And while fresh sperm is available,
why take the chance?"

The Palo Alto doctor, on the other
hand, takes that chance when he must.
"Frozen sperm is used as a backup for
fresh," he said, recognizing the fact
that frozen semen "is not as successful
as fresh semen" for fertilizing the
ovum.
The Palo Alto doctor believes that
frozen semen "may have a shelf life,"
or that it may not survive indefinitely
in cold storage. Therefore, he keeps his
specimen for only short periods in a
liquid nitrogen-cooled tank at -321F
degrees. Since the schedules of his
donors and patients don't always
coincide, he uses storage method out
of convenience and necessity.
This method may become more
efficient as the demand for artificial
insemination grows. According to
Finkle, 10,000 babies were born as a
result of artificial insemination in
1966, and the number has increased
steadily since then.
Artificial insemination has been in
use for humans since 1890, he points

out, "but it remained hidden in the
closet until a few years ago."
Recent Growth
Finkle explains the causes for the
recent growth: "With the advent of
the birth control pill and the change in
the therapeutic abortion law, babies
are almost unavailable for adoption.
So, what was once an occasional
request for artificial insemination has
become a deluge, when compared to
what happened previously."
"Between 15 and 20 percent of the
married population is infertile," Finkle
estimates, "and of this, about 40
percent is due to the male factor. So
suddenly there's a whole group of
people who are candidates for
adopting babies, who are unable to
adopt."
If recent trends are any indication,
artificial insemination as a practice
should continue to grow. Possible
repercussions upon the population's
gene pool do not disturb either doctor.
Sperm Pool
"There are many other greater
worries in the world than the sperm
pool, and artificial insemination is not
performed at a magnitude that will
affect it,"says Finkle.
The donors themselves do not seem
to be adversely affected by the
unusual demands of their work. None
could be reached for comment, but
according to Finkle, he has witnessed
no psychological difficulties.
"I've never had anybody have
difficulty producing a masturbation
specimen," he said. However, he
concedes, "I've had donors forget —
and that might have been a euphemism
for 'I couldn't.' "
The Palo Alto doctor, too, reports
no difficulties. He says this is a
reflection upon the character of the
donors he uses.
"We use medical students who are
willing to help out someone," he says.
"Giving life is a great responsibility,
and it has to be approached as such."
