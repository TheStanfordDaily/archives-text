# Wrestlers Fifth Despite Injuries

### BRUCE KADDEN 
Despite missing its two top
grapplers due to injuries, the
Stanford wrestling team placed
fifth out of 12 teams in the Cal
State-Hayward Tournament on
Saturday.
Marc Frelier (177) and Gary
Anderson (Hwy) led the Cards in
the tourney, while co-captains
Ken Krebs (142) and Chris Horpel
(150) nursed their bruises. Frelier
did a "great job" according to
coach Joe De Meo, placing third.
Anderson, in only his second
college outing after playing frosh

football, was an "outstanding,
outstanding' wrestler according
to De Meo. After defeating
California's heavyweight,
Anderson beat a national AAU
wrestling and judo champion to
earn a spot in the finals, where he
was trimmed, 2-1.
All of Stanford's wrestlers who
participated in the Hayward
tournament won at least one
match, which pleased De Meo.
Last Thursday the Cards
opened their winter quarter
competition with a 30-16 setback
at the hands of Humboldt State.

De Meo said that Horpel and
Krebs "would have made the
difference" had they not been
injured.
Another factor in the loss was
the forfeit of the 118-pound class.
On the brighter side, De Meo
praised the victory by Roy Tolles
(190), a transfer student. Jim
Tatarakis (126) and Emmett
Stanton (158) also won their
matches.
Craig Reynolds (150), taking
over for Horpel, and Anderson
turned in good performances

despite losing efforts. De Meo
wasn't upset with the loss to
Humboldt, rated fourth in the
state, only disappointed that the
Cards didn't have their whole
squad.
Tomorrow night Stanford
takes on San Jose State, rated
sixth in California. The 7:30
match is scheduled for Encina
Gym, but De Meo hoped to have
it changed to Maples Pavilion,
expecting a good turn-out.
He is not only confident of a
large crowd, but he expects the
Cards, rated eighth in the state, to
upset San Jose, despite the
injuries. In his three years as
Stanford's wrestling coach, his
teams have never been plagued
with injuries, but this year the
grapplers have had more than
their share.
Before the vacation, John
Govea injured his knee, forcing
him out for the year. De Meo said
that he hopes to have Horpel and
Krebs back by Saturday, which
will mean they will miss the
Friday meet against Hawaii.
Saturday, the Cards host
UCLA and Cornell in a triangular
meet in Maples. De Mep, a Cornell
alumnus, has been looking
forward to match for a long
time. He sentyinvitations to all
Cornell alumni residing in
Northern California.
