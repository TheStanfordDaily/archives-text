# Buell-Led JVs Rebound To Bounce Cuesta, 73-66

### TIM FERGUSON 
Guard Terry McCartin scored 18 points and
Scott Russell grabbed 14 rebounds Saturday night
at Maples as the Cardinal junior varsity gave Bob
Buell his first "head coaching" victory, 73-66 over
Cuesta College.
The win, which evened the young Cards' record
at 2-2, balanced Friday's 76-68 shellacking bv the
Santa Clara JV.
Buell, who played forward for Stanford's varsity
last season, moved up from his assistant's post while
head coach Billy Jones embarked on a scouting
mission to Washington. While brushing aside any
personal credit for the overnight Cardinal
improvement, Buell conceded, "It was fun. I'll have
to admit it."
Stanford led Cuesta for most of the game,
trailing only for the first few minutes because of
some bad passing (the Cards led in turnovers,
23-10). The Cougars, with a maximum height of
6-4, were a much better match for Stanford than
was Santa Clara, which sported 6-11 Scott Rider
and 6-7 Bill Scott.
Up against such superior height, Stanford
committed 27 personal fouls Friday, with McCartin
and Marty Moroski fouling out. The foul total was
cut to 13 in Saturday's victory.
Most importantly, Stanford shot better. The
Cards missed only 35 attempts, while Cuesta failed
on 63. McCartin's 18 points gave him a season
average of 15.5, and two of the young Marylander's
baskets, along with two by fellow guard Bob Brain,
came in a clutch stretch after Cuesta had narrowed
the Card lead to 64-62 with five minutes left.
McCartin "has presence of mind late in the
game," Buell said afterward. He credited his while
team with showing "good judgement on shots at the
end" and possessing poise in calling time-outs when

a Cardinal was double-teamed.
Center Russell matched his rebound total
Saturday in points, as he has for the season (44 of
both). The lanky freshman (6-8, 180) is rarely
intimidating on the court, but often proves
deceptively quick. Buell says Russell has "a good
short jump shot."
The Cards were not as skillful against the better
Broncos Friday. Guard Dave Wenig scored 23 for
Santa Clara, and Bill Scott snared 13 rebounds to go
with his 17 points. Despite the height disadvantage,
Stanford lost the rebound war only 40-46, but lost
the game at the free throw line: the Broncos made
22 to Stanford's 10.
The Cardinals lost much of their punch when
McCartin fouled-out, but Buell claimed, "We lost
the game before that."
The few who attended Saturday's game nearly
lost their sanity. Cuesta brought a crew of
vociferous cheerleaders whose inane yells helped
suggest an answer to the question, "Where were you
in '62?" and prompted some wags in the press
section to suggest that the JVs not schedule Cuesta
next season.
