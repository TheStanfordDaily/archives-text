# Cards Stumble, Fumble, Lose Twice
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON STAN WILSON 
Howie Dallmar summed it up pretty well himself.
"You can definitely call it a lost weekend, in
more ways than one.
"It's different if turnovers are forced by a
physical team like last night [against Oregon], But
tonight [against Oregon State] there was no
pressure. We just couldn't complete a pass. There
was no excuse for it.
"It was the worst exhibition of basketball any
Stanford team has displayed ...
"We need some direction out there."
Stanford indeed needs something. Friday night
the Cardinals dropped a 48-47 wrestling match to
Oregon in their Pacific Eight opener and Saturday
Stanford completed its nightmarish weekend with a
56-53 loss to Oregon State.
Many had hoped that Friday's loss was a fluke.
Most of the fans even returned to Maples Saturday
night, realizing that a victory over the Beavers
would put the Cards no worse than third in the
Pac-8.
May Get Worse
But now Stanford is last. And with USC and
UCLA coming up next weekend — in Los Angeles —
things may get worse before they get better.
Never mind that both of this weekend's games
were close, and that with a few breaks Stanford
could easily be 2-0 instead of 0-2. "Good teams win
tight games," Dallmar said.
Oregon State may not be a good team, but the
Beavers "hung in there and battled," according to
freshman forward Lonnie Shelton. "We just played
hard and stuck it out."
Shelton, OSU's leading scorer and rebounder,
didn't play in the first half "because I had a terrible
headache." At least that's what he said. Oregon
State coach Ralph Miller said Shelton didn't start
because of "personal reasons" and refused to
elaborate. /
The real reason was that Shelton missed curfew
Friday night. Anyway, when Shelton finally entered
the game in the second half, Stanford had a
headache. Shelton scored six points, grabbed five
rebounds and rejected most of the shots that
threatened to soar above his monstrous 6-8, 235
pound frame.
'Got To Realize . ..'
"Our big guys were shooting like it was
automatic," Dallmar said. "They've got to take it up
strong. They've got to realize that other people can
block shots too."
But Shelton's heroics were only part of the story.
The Cardinals committed 29 turnovers ("They
didn't hold on to the ball very well," Miller
understated), and normally reliable Rich Kelley
managed only two field goals in 16 attempts and
was responsible for 11 turnovers.
But there's more bad news to come. Stanford
was held scoreless for seven minutes in the
first half, and the Cards failed to protect a 53-50
advantage they gained on a 15-foot jumper by Dave
Frost with 3:13 remaining. Steve Ericksen pulled
the Beavers within one at the 2:07 mark, and when
sophomore Paul Miller meshed a 25-foot jump shot
with 16 seconds left, Stanford was panic-stricken.
The Cards, down 54-53, tried to maneuver for
the last shot. Instead, they recorded the last
turnover as Frost caught a Mark Gilberg pass out of
bounds.
Instant Replay
It was all quite upsetting, but hardly unique.
Friday night against Oregon, the Cards were also
doomed by a last-second turnover. Stanford, having
battled back from a seven-point deficit, trailed by
only two with 12 seconds left. Scott Trobbe
dribbled the ball upcourt and passed in the corner
to Tim Patterson. But the ball glanced off
Patterson's hands and rolled out of bounds, much to
the delight of Oregon's eccentric bench.
"Defense" was an oft-heard word in Oregon's
jubilant locker room.
"We've played better defensive halves," said

Duck coach Dick Harter, "but over 40 minutes it
was the best defense we've played all year."
Dallmar concurred. "They were the best
defensive team we've faced," he said. "La Salle may
have been quicker, but Ronnie Lee makes up for
any quickness the team lacks."
Lee, a 6-4 guard who earned first team All-Pac-8
recognition as a freshman last year, converted only
5-17 field goals and 4-9 free throws. But his floor
play and defense were deciding factors.
"He dominates," said Dallmar, "which is amazing
for a guy his size."
A night later, after the double debacle had
.dropped Stanford's overall record to 5-5, Dallmar
said he "had no idea why we played a weekend like
that. I can't figure it out."

Cardinal Notes: On the positive side ... Frost
continued his outstanding play, scoring 32 points
over the weekend.... Ben Bluitt, in his first
lengthy appearance for the varsity, connected on
four of six field goal attempts Saturday night. All
four were long bombs.... Ed Schweitzer sank
seven of 10 field goal tries Saturday and grabbed
five rebounds.... Mike Mann made his first
appearance in nearly three weeks Saturday night.
Mann, who bruised his knee on Dec. 21 against Ohio
State, seems to be fully recovered.

Cardinal Notes: On the positive side ... Frost
continued his outstanding play, scoring 32 points
over the weekend.... Ben Bluitt, in his first
lengthy appearance for the varsity, connected on
four of six field goal attempts Saturday night. All
four were long bombs.... Ed Schweitzer sank
seven of 10 field goal tries Saturday and grabbed
five rebounds.... Mike Mann made his first
appearance in nearly three weeks Saturday night.
Mann, who bruised his knee on Dec. 21 against Ohio
State, seems to be fully recovered.

SOME CONSOLATION — Ed Schweitzer flips in a layup over
Oregon's Stu Jackson (32) during Friday night's 48-47 loss to the
Ducks. Saturday Stanford was Oregon State's victim, 56-53, leaving
the Cards 0-2 after their first weekend of Pacific Eight action.
Howie Dallmar summed it up pretty well himself.
"You can definitely call it a lost weekend, in
more ways than one.
"It's different if turnovers are forced by a
physical team like last night [against Oregon], But
tonight [against Oregon State] there was no
pressure. We just couldn't complete a pass. There
was no excuse for it.
"It was the worst exhibition of basketball any
Stanford team has displayed ...
"We need some direction out there."
Stanford indeed needs something. Friday night
the Cardinals dropped a 48-47 wrestling match to
Oregon in their Pacific Eight opener and Saturday
Stanford completed its nightmarish weekend with a
56-53 loss to Oregon State.
Many had hoped that Friday's loss was a fluke.
Most of the fans even returned to Maples Saturday
night, realizing that a victory over the Beavers
would put the Cards no worse than third in the
Pac-8.
May Get Worse
But now Stanford is last. And with USC and
UCLA coming up next weekend — in Los Angeles —
things may get worse before they get better.
Never mind that both of this weekend's games
were close, and that with a few breaks Stanford
could easily be 2-0 instead of 0-2. "Good teams win
tight games," Dallmar said.
Oregon State may not be a good team, but the
Beavers "hung in there and battled," according to
freshman forward Lonnie Shelton. "We just played
hard and stuck it out."
Shelton, OSU's leading scorer and rebounder,
didn't play in the first half "because I had a terrible
headache." At least that's what he said. Oregon
State coach Ralph Miller said Shelton didn't start
because of "personal reasons" and refused to
elaborate. /
The real reason was that Shelton missed curfew
Friday night. Anyway, when Shelton finally entered
the game in the second half, Stanford had a
headache. Shelton scored six points, grabbed five
rebounds and rejected most of the shots that
threatened to soar above his monstrous 6-8, 235
pound frame.
'Got To Realize . ..'
"Our big guys were shooting like it was
automatic," Dallmar said. "They've got to take it up
strong. They've got to realize that other people can
block shots too."
But Shelton's heroics were only part of the story.
The Cardinals committed 29 turnovers ("They
didn't hold on to the ball very well," Miller
understated), and normally reliable Rich Kelley
managed only two field goals in 16 attempts and
was responsible for 11 turnovers.
But there's more bad news to come. Stanford
was held scoreless for seven minutes in the
first half, and the Cards failed to protect a 53-50
advantage they gained on a 15-foot jumper by Dave
Frost with 3:13 remaining. Steve Ericksen pulled
the Beavers within one at the 2:07 mark, and when
sophomore Paul Miller meshed a 25-foot jump shot
with 16 seconds left, Stanford was panic-stricken.
The Cards, down 54-53, tried to maneuver for
the last shot. Instead, they recorded the last
turnover as Frost caught a Mark Gilberg pass out of
bounds.
Instant Replay
It was all quite upsetting, but hardly unique.
Friday night against Oregon, the Cards were also
doomed by a last-second turnover. Stanford, having
battled back from a seven-point deficit, trailed by
only two with 12 seconds left. Scott Trobbe
dribbled the ball upcourt and passed in the corner
to Tim Patterson. But the ball glanced off
Patterson's hands and rolled out of bounds, much to
the delight of Oregon's eccentric bench.
"Defense" was an oft-heard word in Oregon's
jubilant locker room.
"We've played better defensive halves," said

Duck coach Dick Harter, "but over 40 minutes it
was the best defense we've played all year."
Dallmar concurred. "They were the best
defensive team we've faced," he said. "La Salle may
have been quicker, but Ronnie Lee makes up for
any quickness the team lacks."
Lee, a 6-4 guard who earned first team All-Pac-8
recognition as a freshman last year, converted only
5-17 field goals and 4-9 free throws. But his floor
play and defense were deciding factors.
"He dominates," said Dallmar, "which is amazing
for a guy his size."
A night later, after the double debacle had
.dropped Stanford's overall record to 5-5, Dallmar
said he "had no idea why we played a weekend like
that. I can't figure it out."

Duck coach Dick Harter, "but over 40 minutes it
was the best defense we've played all year."
Dallmar concurred. "They were the best
defensive team we've faced," he said. "La Salle may
have been quicker, but Ronnie Lee makes up for
any quickness the team lacks."
Lee, a 6-4 guard who earned first team All-Pac-8
recognition as a freshman last year, converted only
5-17 field goals and 4-9 free throws. But his floor
play and defense were deciding factors.
"He dominates," said Dallmar, "which is amazing
for a guy his size."
A night later, after the double debacle had
.dropped Stanford's overall record to 5-5, Dallmar
said he "had no idea why we played a weekend like
that. I can't figure it out."

Cardinal Notes: On the positive side ... Frost
continued his outstanding play, scoring 32 points
over the weekend.... Ben Bluitt, in his first
lengthy appearance for the varsity, connected on
four of six field goal attempts Saturday night. All
four were long bombs.... Ed Schweitzer sank
seven of 10 field goal tries Saturday and grabbed
five rebounds.... Mike Mann made his first
appearance in nearly three weeks Saturday night.
Mann, who bruised his knee on Dec. 21 against Ohio
State, seems to be fully recovered.

SOME CONSOLATION — Ed Schweitzer flips in a layup over
Oregon's Stu Jackson (32) during Friday night's 48-47 loss to the
Ducks. Saturday Stanford was Oregon State's victim, 56-53, leaving
the Cards 0-2 after their first weekend of Pacific Eight action.
Howie Dallmar summed it up pretty well himself.
"You can definitely call it a lost weekend, in
more ways than one.
"It's different if turnovers are forced by a
physical team like last night [against Oregon], But
tonight [against Oregon State] there was no
pressure. We just couldn't complete a pass. There
was no excuse for it.
"It was the worst exhibition of basketball any
Stanford team has displayed ...
"We need some direction out there."
Stanford indeed needs something. Friday night
the Cardinals dropped a 48-47 wrestling match to
Oregon in their Pacific Eight opener and Saturday
Stanford completed its nightmarish weekend with a
56-53 loss to Oregon State.
Many had hoped that Friday's loss was a fluke.
Most of the fans even returned to Maples Saturday
night, realizing that a victory over the Beavers
would put the Cards no worse than third in the
Pac-8.
May Get Worse
But now Stanford is last. And with USC and
UCLA coming up next weekend — in Los Angeles —
things may get worse before they get better.
Never mind that both of this weekend's games
were close, and that with a few breaks Stanford
could easily be 2-0 instead of 0-2. "Good teams win
tight games," Dallmar said.
Oregon State may not be a good team, but the
Beavers "hung in there and battled," according to
freshman forward Lonnie Shelton. "We just played
hard and stuck it out."
Shelton, OSU's leading scorer and rebounder,
didn't play in the first half "because I had a terrible
headache." At least that's what he said. Oregon
State coach Ralph Miller said Shelton didn't start
because of "personal reasons" and refused to
elaborate. /
The real reason was that Shelton missed curfew
Friday night. Anyway, when Shelton finally entered
the game in the second half, Stanford had a
headache. Shelton scored six points, grabbed five
rebounds and rejected most of the shots that
threatened to soar above his monstrous 6-8, 235
pound frame.
'Got To Realize . ..'
"Our big guys were shooting like it was
automatic," Dallmar said. "They've got to take it up
strong. They've got to realize that other people can
block shots too."
But Shelton's heroics were only part of the story.
The Cardinals committed 29 turnovers ("They
didn't hold on to the ball very well," Miller
understated), and normally reliable Rich Kelley
managed only two field goals in 16 attempts and
was responsible for 11 turnovers.
But there's more bad news to come. Stanford
was held scoreless for seven minutes in the
first half, and the Cards failed to protect a 53-50
advantage they gained on a 15-foot jumper by Dave
Frost with 3:13 remaining. Steve Ericksen pulled
the Beavers within one at the 2:07 mark, and when
sophomore Paul Miller meshed a 25-foot jump shot
with 16 seconds left, Stanford was panic-stricken.
The Cards, down 54-53, tried to maneuver for
the last shot. Instead, they recorded the last
turnover as Frost caught a Mark Gilberg pass out of
bounds.
Instant Replay
It was all quite upsetting, but hardly unique.
Friday night against Oregon, the Cards were also
doomed by a last-second turnover. Stanford, having
battled back from a seven-point deficit, trailed by
only two with 12 seconds left. Scott Trobbe
dribbled the ball upcourt and passed in the corner
to Tim Patterson. But the ball glanced off
Patterson's hands and rolled out of bounds, much to
the delight of Oregon's eccentric bench.
"Defense" was an oft-heard word in Oregon's
jubilant locker room.

Duck coach Dick Harter, "but over 40 minutes it
