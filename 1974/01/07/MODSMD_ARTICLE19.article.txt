# Pac-8 Roundup
## Cougars Stun Trojans; Bruins Humble Huskies 
### 
While disaster struck twice at
Stanford during the Pacific Eight's
opening weekend, USC was
experiencing a faux pas of its own
in Pullman, Wash.
Led by freshman center Steve
Puidokas (22 points), Washington
State blew the Trojans out
quickly Saturday afternoon, led
37-21 at halftime, and held on for
a s 71-56 upset over the
seventh-ranked men of Troy.
Cougar coach George Raveling
said his team "caught USC on an
off-game, and we were on."
USC, along with UCLA, which
opened in high fashion at
Washington, completes a long
weekend in the northwest tonight.
The Bruins continued the
overpowering play they have
displayed since the second-half
murder of North Carolina State
December 15. Washington was the
embarrassed victim Saturday
night, suffering its worst loss in
history, 100-48.
UCLA didn't miss a shot for
the first eight minutes, and forced
the Huskies into 15 first half
turnovers. The Bruins seek to
lower Washington State from
cloud nine tonight.
Had an Oregon cheerleader not
performed a devious deed at
Harmon Gym Saturday, California
might be unbeaten in league play
along with its sister school to the
south.
Confronted with the prospect
of the ball bounding towards her,
which would have resulted in a
key Duck turnover, the lass
returned the ball to Oregon's
Bruce Coldren in an action
witnessed by everyone except the
two referees. Coldren passed to
Stu Jackson, whose basket lifted
the Ducks past the Bears, 54-52.
Cal had held Oregon State's
Lonnie Shelton to only two
points the night before in beating
the Beavers, 61-54.
