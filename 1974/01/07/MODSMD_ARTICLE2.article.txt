# Faculty Senate To Consider ROTC Reinstatement Thursday
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Reopening an issue dormant since
the tumultuous spring of 1970, the
Faculty Senate will discuss the
initiation of new ROTC military
training programs at its meeting
Thursday, Jan. 10.
Petitions signed this fall by 52
faculty members placed the matter on
the Senate agenda. It's there, said
Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler, "for informal discussion
and advice on procedure to the
Steering Committee."
Administration officials are
cautious about forecasting a
resurrection of ROTC. They
emphasize that the question is up to
the faculty.
"Any decision will be a long time in
the future," Winbigler said. "Of
course, the Senate could just say
forget it. But the general assumption is
that the Senate will ask for more
information."
"It's a faculty responsibility," said
Provost William F. Miller. "The
question is for them to decide. It's

essential for anyone who wants such a
program to have the faculty on board
in the first place — and it's their
responsibility."
Miller acknowledged that he favors
ROTC programs in general, but said he
has no position on ROTC here.
"I think the nation needs such
programs," he said. "Whether that
applies to Stanford or not is a
separable issue .... I think it depends
on whether students want to do it —
whether they're interested, whether it
can serve them, and whether it can
meet our criteria."
Those criteria — chiefly, questions
of academic credit, faculty rank and
the "punitive clause" in ROTC
contracts (which subjects students to
immediate induction if they quit the
program) — have never been clearly
defined. They were focal points of
faculty debate on the ROTC issue
between 1968 and 1970, and are likely
to provoke extended discussion this
time as well.
But the controversy raged on
several levels. Some ROTC opponents

called military training incompatible
with academic freedom, some fought
it on philosophical, anti-military
grounds, and others opposed it as part
of a stance against the Indochina war.
ROTC's defenders, too, cited reasons
ranging from academic liberalism to
national security for their position.
On May 7, 1970, after weeks of
anti-ROTC demonstrations, several
days of campus street fighting between
police and hundreds of students, and a
week-long strike that effectively closed
the University, the Faculty Senate
voted 36 to 8 to bar future academic
credit for ROTC and closed the
program "as presently constituted" to
new enrollment.
Later that year, an advisory
committee supported the Senate's
action, but noted that "the universities
and the Department of Defense ought
to be able to devise a form of officer
training that a university student
might obtain concurrently with his
education, that would impose upon
the student no compromises upon the
pursuit of his own intellectual and
academic ambitions and that would
not produce the incompatibilities
between university education and
military training inherent in the
present ROTC concept."
Robert J. Barker, a graduate
student in applied physics who
initiated this fall's faculty petition,
said military officials have agreed to
improve ROTC's intellectual quality.
The Defense Department has approved
a plan to incorporate ROTC into the
general curriculum, allowing university
professors to teach ROTC courses in
such subjects as military history and
economics, Barker said. Under the
plan, military maneuvers could be
moved to off-campus installations.
Barker proposes that ROTC courses be
granted academic credit on a
course-by-course, petition basis.
Barker believes these changes meet
the conditions specified by the 1970
committee report. Most other
objections to ROTC, he said, "became
irrelevant with the end of American
participation in the Indochina conflict

and the discontinuation of the draft."
Barker attempted to bring the issue
to the Senate last spring, but a student
petition he circulated garnered only
150 signatures — far too few to force
faculty action. The Senate's Steering
Committee declined to place ROTC on
the agenda until Barker's faculty
petition forced such action.
The question was originally placed
on the agenda of the Senate's Dec. 13
meeting, but the Senate adjourned
before the item could be raised. About
35 demonstrators marched outside the
meeting, chanting "Stop R-O-T-C" and
carrying signs.
"The demonstration showed that
there will be significant opposition to
ROTC," declared ASSU President
Kevin o'Grady, one of the protesters.

Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler, "for informal discussion
and advice on procedure to the
Steering Committee."
Administration officials are
cautious about forecasting a
resurrection of ROTC. They
emphasize that the question is up to
the faculty.
"Any decision will be a long time in
the future," Winbigler said. "Of
course, the Senate could just say
forget it. But the general assumption is
that the Senate will ask for more
information."
"It's a faculty responsibility," said
Provost William F. Miller. "The
question is for them to decide. It's

essential for anyone who wants such a
program to have the faculty on board
in the first place — and it's their
responsibility."
Miller acknowledged that he favors
ROTC programs in general, but said he
has no position on ROTC here.
"I think the nation needs such
programs," he said. "Whether that
applies to Stanford or not is a
separable issue .... I think it depends
on whether students want to do it —
whether they're interested, whether it
can serve them, and whether it can
meet our criteria."
Those criteria — chiefly, questions
of academic credit, faculty rank and
the "punitive clause" in ROTC
contracts (which subjects students to
immediate induction if they quit the
program) — have never been clearly
defined. They were focal points of
faculty debate on the ROTC issue
between 1968 and 1970, and are likely
to provoke extended discussion this
time as well.
But the controversy raged on
several levels. Some ROTC opponents

called military training incompatible
with academic freedom, some fought
it on philosophical, anti-military
grounds, and others opposed it as part
of a stance against the Indochina war.
ROTC's defenders, too, cited reasons
ranging from academic liberalism to
national security for their position.
On May 7, 1970, after weeks of
anti-ROTC demonstrations, several
days of campus street fighting between
police and hundreds of students, and a
week-long strike that effectively closed
the University, the Faculty Senate
voted 36 to 8 to bar future academic
credit for ROTC and closed the
program "as presently constituted" to
new enrollment.
Later that year, an advisory
committee supported the Senate's
action, but noted that "the universities
and the Department of Defense ought
to be able to devise a form of officer
training that a university student
might obtain concurrently with his
education, that would impose upon
the student no compromises upon the
pursuit of his own intellectual and
academic ambitions and that would
not produce the incompatibilities
between university education and
military training inherent in the
present ROTC concept."
Robert J. Barker, a graduate
student in applied physics who
initiated this fall's faculty petition,
said military officials have agreed to
improve ROTC's intellectual quality.
The Defense Department has approved
a plan to incorporate ROTC into the
general curriculum, allowing university
professors to teach ROTC courses in
such subjects as military history and
economics, Barker said. Under the
plan, military maneuvers could be
moved to off-campus installations.
Barker proposes that ROTC courses be
granted academic credit on a
course-by-course, petition basis.
Barker believes these changes meet
the conditions specified by the 1970
committee report. Most other
objections to ROTC, he said, "became
irrelevant with the end of American
participation in the Indochina conflict

and the discontinuation of the draft."
Barker attempted to bring the issue
to the Senate last spring, but a student
petition he circulated garnered only
150 signatures — far too few to force
faculty action. The Senate's Steering
Committee declined to place ROTC on
the agenda until Barker's faculty
petition forced such action.
The question was originally placed
on the agenda of the Senate's Dec. 13
meeting, but the Senate adjourned
before the item could be raised. About
35 demonstrators marched outside the
meeting, chanting "Stop R-O-T-C" and
carrying signs.
"The demonstration showed that
there will be significant opposition to
ROTC," declared ASSU President
Kevin o'Grady, one of the protesters.
Reopening an issue dormant since
the tumultuous spring of 1970, the
Faculty Senate will discuss the
initiation of new ROTC military
training programs at its meeting
Thursday, Jan. 10.
Petitions signed this fall by 52
faculty members placed the matter on

course, the Senate could just say
forget it. But the general assumption is
that the Senate will ask for more
information."
"It's a faculty responsibility," said
Provost William F. Miller. "The
question is for them to decide. It's

essential for anyone who wants such a
program to have the faculty on board
in the first place — and it's their
responsibility."
Miller acknowledged that he favors
ROTC programs in general, but said he
has no position on ROTC here.
"I think the nation needs such
programs," he said. "Whether that
applies to Stanford or not is a
separable issue .... I think it depends
on whether students want to do it —
whether they're interested, whether it
can serve them, and whether it can
meet our criteria."
Those criteria — chiefly, questions
of academic credit, faculty rank and
the "punitive clause" in ROTC
contracts (which subjects students to
immediate induction if they quit the
program) — have never been clearly
defined. They were focal points of
faculty debate on the ROTC issue
between 1968 and 1970, and are likely
to provoke extended discussion this
time as well.
But the controversy raged on
several levels. Some ROTC opponents

called military training incompatible
with academic freedom, some fought
it on philosophical, anti-military
grounds, and others opposed it as part
of a stance against the Indochina war.
ROTC's defenders, too, cited reasons
ranging from academic liberalism to
national security for their position.
On May 7, 1970, after weeks of
anti-ROTC demonstrations, several
days of campus street fighting between
police and hundreds of students, and a
week-long strike that effectively closed
the University, the Faculty Senate
voted 36 to 8 to bar future academic
credit for ROTC and closed the
program "as presently constituted" to
new enrollment.
Later that year, an advisory
committee supported the Senate's
action, but noted that "the universities
and the Department of Defense ought
to be able to devise a form of officer
training that a university student
might obtain concurrently with his
education, that would impose upon
the student no compromises upon the
pursuit of his own intellectual and
academic ambitions and that would
not produce the incompatibilities
between university education and
military training inherent in the
present ROTC concept."
Robert J. Barker, a graduate
student in applied physics who
initiated this fall's faculty petition,
said military officials have agreed to
improve ROTC's intellectual quality.
The Defense Department has approved
a plan to incorporate ROTC into the
general curriculum, allowing university
professors to teach ROTC courses in
such subjects as military history and
economics, Barker said. Under the
plan, military maneuvers could be
moved to off-campus installations.
Barker proposes that ROTC courses be
granted academic credit on a
course-by-course, petition basis.
Barker believes these changes meet
the conditions specified by the 1970
committee report. Most other
objections to ROTC, he said, "became
irrelevant with the end of American
participation in the Indochina conflict

and the discontinuation of the draft."
Barker attempted to bring the issue
to the Senate last spring, but a student
petition he circulated garnered only
150 signatures — far too few to force
faculty action. The Senate's Steering
Committee declined to place ROTC on
the agenda until Barker's faculty
petition forced such action.
The question was originally placed
on the agenda of the Senate's Dec. 13
meeting, but the Senate adjourned
before the item could be raised. About
35 demonstrators marched outside the
meeting, chanting "Stop R-O-T-C" and
carrying signs.
"The demonstration showed that
there will be significant opposition to
ROTC," declared ASSU President
Kevin o'Grady, one of the protesters.
