# Holiday Basketball Brings Mixed Results
## 
### 
When viewed in its current perspective, Stanford's 4-2
performance over the holidays would have to be considered
near-brilliant.
But there were disappointments as well as victories,
particularly in the finals of the Kentucky Classic, where
Stanford was brutally homered by a pair of twin referees, and
in the opening round of the ECAC Holiday Festival in New
York, where the Cards squandered several leads and eventually
lost to La Salle, 77-66.
Nevertheless, the trip ended in victory, as Stanford upended
St. Louis in a Holiday Festival consolation game. "We learned
a lot," said Stanford coach Howie Dallmar, "but do you
realize ... we might have won the whole thing."
The following is a summary of Stanford's vacation
accomplishments:
STANFORD 56, COLORADO STATE 45 (Dec. 15 at Maples
Pavilion) — The Cards were obviously rusty following finals, but still
managed to coast past Colorado State's tall Rams. Stanford outscored
CSU 31-20 in the second half, breaking a 25-25 halftime deadlock. Rich
Kelley converted 8- 1 2 field goal tries, 3-4 free throws (19 points in all)
and led the Cards to a decisive 45-31 rebounding edge. Dave Frost (10
points) was the only other Cardinal in double figures.
STANFORD 69, ST. MARY'S 63 (Dec. 17 at Moraga) — Highly
touted and previously undefeated St. Mary's revved up the engines on
its alleged "Super-six" and nearly upset the Cards at the Gaels' tiny
gym in Moraga. The Cards maintained precariously slim margins
throughout the game, however, and eventually recorded a six-point
victory. Frost, Kelley and Ed Schweitzer led the Stanford scoring with
17, 14 and 12 points respectively. Highlight of the game was the
play-by-play sheet distributed to the press after the contest. Instead of
the conventional scoring descriptions, an inventive St. Mary's student
wrote, "Frost chills the air," "Dr. Schweitzer, I presume," "Arterberry
aortas one," etc. to describe each basket.
STANFORD 68, OHIO STATE 53 (Dec. 21 at Lexington, Ky. —
first round of Kentucky Classic) — In the Cards' finest overall effort of
the season, 18-point performances by Frost and Tim Patterson lifted
Stanford to a decisive rout over the Buckeyes. The Cards opened up a
31-23 halftime lead and then connected on 15-26 second half shots
while increasing their margin to 15. Kelley added 12 points before
fouling out with 7:19 remaining. Ohio State coach Fred Taylor was so
disgusted by his team's performance that he replaced four of his five
starters for the following night's consolation game against Dartmouth.
KENTUCKY 78, STANFORD 77 (Dec. 22 at Lexington, Ky. -
finals of Kentucky Classic) — "We were robbed," was the only way
Kelley could describe this fiasco. Willard and Wayne Smith, a set of
twins with Southern drawls, not only called 28 fouls on Stanford —
compared to 17 on Kentucky — but also charged Dave Frost with a
technical foul that totally amazed Dallmar. Following Frost's alleged
fifth foul, he walked calmly towards one of the Smiths and asked, "Is
the basket good." Immediately, he was slapped with a technical. "It's
ridiculous to have an important game like that determined by a
technical foul we didn't deserve," said a fuming Dallmar.
Besides Frost, Kelley fouled out with 5:32 remaining and Patterson
exited with 6:52 left. All those whistles unfortunately obscured a
magnificent effort by Kelley, who scored 26 points, snared 27 rebounds
and was named to the All-Tournament team. Patterson added 15
points, Schweitzer scored 14 and Frost contributed 12.
LA SALLE 77, STANFORD 66 (Dec. 27 at Madison Square Garden
— first round of ECAC Holiday Festival) — This time, the whistles were
more justified, but they came even earlier. Stanford had opened up a
seven-point lead early in the second half, but a few minutes later Kelley
picked up his fourth foul. Before the score changed, Kelley cautiously
— and cleanly — blocked a shot. But the referee thought otherwise, and
the disappointed seven-footer left the game with 10:15 remaining.
Patterson picked up his fifth foul shortly thereafter, and Stanford was
unable to maintain control. Frost led all scorers with 26 points (9-20,
8-10, 8 rebounds, 4 assists), but in the end Dallmar was forced to speak
of ironies.
"It's a funny thing," he said. "Coming into the tournament our
strength was our depth. But all of a sudden three of our big guys are on
the bench [Kelley and Patterson with five fouls and Mike Mann with a
bruised knee] and our strength turns out to be our weakness."
STANFORD 79, ST. LOUIS 63 (Dec. 29 at Madison Square Garden
— consolation round of ECAC Holiday Festival) — Taking control from
the opening wake-up call — uh, whistle the Cards coasted past St. Louis'
uninspired Billikens. Tip-off was 10:30 a.m., and the paid attendance
was announced at 67 (including everone, there were about 150). "I
wouldn't have come if I didn't have to," said Billiken forward Bill
Morris. The players did come, though, and Stanford displayed some
superb shooting. The Cards shot 54 percent from the field and 87
percent from the line. Particularly impressive were Kelley points),
Frost (15), Patterson (12) and Melvin Arterberry, who scored 10 points
and contributed a solid floor game.

— and cleanly — blocked a shot. But the referee thought otherwise, and
the disappointed seven-footer left the game with 10:15 remaining.
Patterson picked up his fifth foul shortly thereafter, and Stanford was
unable to maintain control. Frost led all scorers with 26 points (9-20,
8-10, 8 rebounds, 4 assists), but in the end Dallmar was forced to speak
of ironies.
"It's a funny thing," he said. "Coming into the tournament our
strength was our depth. But all of a sudden three of our big guys are on
the bench [Kelley and Patterson with five fouls and Mike Mann with a
bruised knee] and our strength turns out to be our weakness."
STANFORD 79, ST. LOUIS 63 (Dec. 29 at Madison Square Garden
— consolation round of ECAC Holiday Festival) — Taking control from
the opening wake-up call — uh, whistle the Cards coasted past St. Louis'
uninspired Billikens. Tip-off was 10:30 a.m., and the paid attendance
was announced at 67 (including everone, there were about 150). "I
wouldn't have come if I didn't have to," said Billiken forward Bill
Morris. The players did come, though, and Stanford displayed some
superb shooting. The Cards shot 54 percent from the field and 87
percent from the line. Particularly impressive were Kelley points),
Frost (15), Patterson (12) and Melvin Arterberry, who scored 10 points
and contributed a solid floor game.
When viewed in its current perspective, Stanford's 4-2
performance over the holidays would have to be considered
near-brilliant.
But there were disappointments as well as victories,
particularly in the finals of the Kentucky Classic, where
Stanford was brutally homered by a pair of twin referees, and
in the opening round of the ECAC Holiday Festival in New
York, where the Cards squandered several leads and eventually
lost to La Salle, 77-66.
Nevertheless, the trip ended in victory, as Stanford upended
St. Louis in a Holiday Festival consolation game. "We learned
a lot," said Stanford coach Howie Dallmar, "but do you
realize ... we might have won the whole thing."
The following is a summary of Stanford's vacation
accomplishments:
STANFORD 56, COLORADO STATE 45 (Dec. 15 at Maples
Pavilion) — The Cards were obviously rusty following finals, but still
managed to coast past Colorado State's tall Rams. Stanford outscored
CSU 31-20 in the second half, breaking a 25-25 halftime deadlock. Rich
Kelley converted 8- 1 2 field goal tries, 3-4 free throws (19 points in all)
and led the Cards to a decisive 45-31 rebounding edge. Dave Frost (10
points) was the only other Cardinal in double figures.
STANFORD 69, ST. MARY'S 63 (Dec. 17 at Moraga) — Highly
touted and previously undefeated St. Mary's revved up the engines on
its alleged "Super-six" and nearly upset the Cards at the Gaels' tiny
gym in Moraga. The Cards maintained precariously slim margins
throughout the game, however, and eventually recorded a six-point
victory. Frost, Kelley and Ed Schweitzer led the Stanford scoring with
17, 14 and 12 points respectively. Highlight of the game was the
play-by-play sheet distributed to the press after the contest. Instead of
the conventional scoring descriptions, an inventive St. Mary's student
wrote, "Frost chills the air," "Dr. Schweitzer, I presume," "Arterberry
aortas one," etc. to describe each basket.
STANFORD 68, OHIO STATE 53 (Dec. 21 at Lexington, Ky. —
first round of Kentucky Classic) — In the Cards' finest overall effort of
the season, 18-point performances by Frost and Tim Patterson lifted
Stanford to a decisive rout over the Buckeyes. The Cards opened up a
31-23 halftime lead and then connected on 15-26 second half shots
while increasing their margin to 15. Kelley added 12 points before
fouling out with 7:19 remaining. Ohio State coach Fred Taylor was so
disgusted by his team's performance that he replaced four of his five
starters for the following night's consolation game against Dartmouth.
KENTUCKY 78, STANFORD 77 (Dec. 22 at Lexington, Ky. -
finals of Kentucky Classic) — "We were robbed," was the only way
Kelley could describe this fiasco. Willard and Wayne Smith, a set of
twins with Southern drawls, not only called 28 fouls on Stanford —
compared to 17 on Kentucky — but also charged Dave Frost with a
technical foul that totally amazed Dallmar. Following Frost's alleged
fifth foul, he walked calmly towards one of the Smiths and asked, "Is
the basket good." Immediately, he was slapped with a technical. "It's
ridiculous to have an important game like that determined by a
technical foul we didn't deserve," said a fuming Dallmar.
Besides Frost, Kelley fouled out with 5:32 remaining and Patterson
exited with 6:52 left. All those whistles unfortunately obscured a
magnificent effort by Kelley, who scored 26 points, snared 27 rebounds
and was named to the All-Tournament team. Patterson added 15
points, Schweitzer scored 14 and Frost contributed 12.
LA SALLE 77, STANFORD 66 (Dec. 27 at Madison Square Garden
— first round of ECAC Holiday Festival) — This time, the whistles were
more justified, but they came even earlier. Stanford had opened up a
seven-point lead early in the second half, but a few minutes later Kelley
picked up his fourth foul. Before the score changed, Kelley cautiously
— and cleanly — blocked a shot. But the referee thought otherwise, and
the disappointed seven-footer left the game with 10:15 remaining.

fouling out with 7:19 remaining. Ohio State coach Fred Taylor was so
disgusted by his team's performance that he replaced four of his five
starters for the following night's consolation game against Dartmouth.
KENTUCKY 78, STANFORD 77 (Dec. 22 at Lexington, Ky. -
finals of Kentucky Classic) — "We were robbed," was the only way
Kelley could describe this fiasco. Willard and Wayne Smith, a set of
twins with Southern drawls, not only called 28 fouls on Stanford —
compared to 17 on Kentucky — but also charged Dave Frost with a
technical foul that totally amazed Dallmar. Following Frost's alleged
fifth foul, he walked calmly towards one of the Smiths and asked, "Is
the basket good." Immediately, he was slapped with a technical. "It's
ridiculous to have an important game like that determined by a
technical foul we didn't deserve," said a fuming Dallmar.
Besides Frost, Kelley fouled out with 5:32 remaining and Patterson
exited with 6:52 left. All those whistles unfortunately obscured a
magnificent effort by Kelley, who scored 26 points, snared 27 rebounds
and was named to the All-Tournament team. Patterson added 15
points, Schweitzer scored 14 and Frost contributed 12.
LA SALLE 77, STANFORD 66 (Dec. 27 at Madison Square Garden
— first round of ECAC Holiday Festival) — This time, the whistles were
more justified, but they came even earlier. Stanford had opened up a
seven-point lead early in the second half, but a few minutes later Kelley
picked up his fourth foul. Before the score changed, Kelley cautiously
— and cleanly — blocked a shot. But the referee thought otherwise, and
the disappointed seven-footer left the game with 10:15 remaining.
Patterson picked up his fifth foul shortly thereafter, and Stanford was
unable to maintain control. Frost led all scorers with 26 points (9-20,
8-10, 8 rebounds, 4 assists), but in the end Dallmar was forced to speak
of ironies.
"It's a funny thing," he said. "Coming into the tournament our
strength was our depth. But all of a sudden three of our big guys are on
the bench [Kelley and Patterson with five fouls and Mike Mann with a
bruised knee] and our strength turns out to be our weakness."
STANFORD 79, ST. LOUIS 63 (Dec. 29 at Madison Square Garden
— consolation round of ECAC Holiday Festival) — Taking control from
the opening wake-up call — uh, whistle the Cards coasted past St. Louis'
uninspired Billikens. Tip-off was 10:30 a.m., and the paid attendance
was announced at 67 (including everone, there were about 150). "I
wouldn't have come if I didn't have to," said Billiken forward Bill
Morris. The players did come, though, and Stanford displayed some
superb shooting. The Cards shot 54 percent from the field and 87
percent from the line. Particularly impressive were Kelley points),
Frost (15), Patterson (12) and Melvin Arterberry, who scored 10 points
and contributed a solid floor game.
When viewed in its current perspective, Stanford's 4-2
performance over the holidays would have to be considered
near-brilliant.
But there were disappointments as well as victories,
particularly in the finals of the Kentucky Classic, where
Stanford was brutally homered by a pair of twin referees, and
in the opening round of the ECAC Holiday Festival in New
York, where the Cards squandered several leads and eventually
lost to La Salle, 77-66.
Nevertheless, the trip ended in victory, as Stanford upended
St. Louis in a Holiday Festival consolation game. "We learned
a lot," said Stanford coach Howie Dallmar, "but do you
realize ... we might have won the whole thing."
The following is a summary of Stanford's vacation
accomplishments:
STANFORD 56, COLORADO STATE 45 (Dec. 15 at Maples
Pavilion) — The Cards were obviously rusty following finals, but still
managed to coast past Colorado State's tall Rams. Stanford outscored
CSU 31-20 in the second half, breaking a 25-25 halftime deadlock. Rich
Kelley converted 8- 1 2 field goal tries, 3-4 free throws (19 points in all)
and led the Cards to a decisive 45-31 rebounding edge. Dave Frost (10
points) was the only other Cardinal in double figures.
STANFORD 69, ST. MARY'S 63 (Dec. 17 at Moraga) — Highly
touted and previously undefeated St. Mary's revved up the engines on
its alleged "Super-six" and nearly upset the Cards at the Gaels' tiny
gym in Moraga. The Cards maintained precariously slim margins
throughout the game, however, and eventually recorded a six-point
victory. Frost, Kelley and Ed Schweitzer led the Stanford scoring with
17, 14 and 12 points respectively. Highlight of the game was the
play-by-play sheet distributed to the press after the contest. Instead of
the conventional scoring descriptions, an inventive St. Mary's student
wrote, "Frost chills the air," "Dr. Schweitzer, I presume," "Arterberry
aortas one," etc. to describe each basket.
STANFORD 68, OHIO STATE 53 (Dec. 21 at Lexington, Ky. —
first round of Kentucky Classic) — In the Cards' finest overall effort of
the season, 18-point performances by Frost and Tim Patterson lifted
Stanford to a decisive rout over the Buckeyes. The Cards opened up a
31-23 halftime lead and then connected on 15-26 second half shots
while increasing their margin to 15. Kelley added 12 points before
fouling out with 7:19 remaining. Ohio State coach Fred Taylor was so
