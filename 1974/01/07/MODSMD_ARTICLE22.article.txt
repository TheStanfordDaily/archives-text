Troops Seal London Airport
LONDON — Troops and tanks sealed off London
airport for the second straight day yesterday amid
reports that CIA and other intelligence agencies
believe up to 20 terrorist attacks are imminent in
Europe.
"Several terrorist groups who do not share a
common aim are involved and evidence has emerged
that suggests there is growing cooperation among
them," the Sunday Times said without elaborating.
Meanwhile, an American girl detained at
Heathrow Airport Friday during investigations into
international arms smuggling flew to New York, the
Home Office said. It identified her as Robin Orban
of San Diego, a model, but stressed she was not
being deported because she had never formally
entered Britain.
On her arrival at Kennedy Airport, Orban, 25,
was taken to a private room at the Trans World
Airlines terminal for questioning by three FBI
agents, according to TWA officials.
An FBI spokesman said the agency "was not in a
position yet to comment" on the questioning.
Three persons said by detectives to be her
"known associates" — Allison Thompson, 18, of
Santa Barbara, Calif., Abdelkhir el-Hakkaoui, 25, of
Morocco, and Athar Naseem, 21, of Pakistan — were
charged Saturday with conspiracy relating to the
possession of firearms and continued without bail
until Jan. 14.
Arabs Risk U.S. Use Of Force
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense James R.
Schlesinger says Arab nations risk increasing U.S.
public demand for force against them if they carry
their oil embargo too far.
"I think that that is a risk," Schlesinger said.
However, the defense chief said he does not
believe it will come to that because the
oil-producing states already have indicated an easing
of pressure by increasing the flow to some European
countries and Japan.
"We should recognize that the independent
powers of sovereign states should not be used in
such a way as would cripple the larger mass of the
industrialized world," Schlesinger said in an
interview recorded for broadcast on public
television stations tonight.

"That is running too high a risk and it is a source
of danger, I think, not only from our standpoint,
but from the standpoint of the oil-producing
nations."
At the same time, Schlesinger said, "the
alleviation of pressure" represented by a 10 percent
increase in oil output announced last month "is an
indication that the oil-producing states recognize
their common interests with the industrialized
world."
Mideast Fighting Flares Again
Units of Egypt's 2nd Army have been trying to
consolidate a 200-yard advance on the east bank of
the Suez Canal and the Israelis have been trying to
drive them back, the U.N. Emergency Force said
yesterday.
Spokesman Birger Hallden told newsmen in Cairo
there were "brief but intense exchanges on the east
bank" 3'/2 miles southeast of Qantara on Friday,
"where according to U.N. commanders the positions
of the parties appeared to be unstable."
Questioned by newsmen, Hallden could not say
what use of the word unstable meant in military
terms. But he said it did not imply the cease-fire was
breaking down in that area.
On Tuesday Egyptian forces were reported to
have moved forward 200 yards in this area and
planted land mines. Later the Egyptians canceled a
meeting with U.N. field commanders to discuss a
withdrawal.
Birth Control Funds Inadequate
NEW YORK — Ford Foundation and Rockefeller
Foundation officials said Sunday that financial
support for research in birth control is "entirely
inadequate."
Because of declining financial support, the
officials said, it may not be possible to take
advantage of the advances in fundamental
understanding of human reproduction made during
the last 10 years.
Basic findings in biology that may not be
utilized, foundation officials said, concern chemical
details of the way the brain controls reproductive
functions through the pituitary gland, the role of
chemical mediators of hormone action, and the role
of the genetic machinery in the chemical and
physiological action of hormones.

"To use these advances in knowledge for
improved methods of fertility control," the officials
said, "increased levels of expenditures are required."
Dutch Face Gas Rationing
AMSTERDAM — After 10 weeks of a total Arab
oil embargo, Dutchmen face gasoline rationing,
reduced work weeks and the prospect of a sharp
cutback in industrial production.
Nevertheless, they are struggling to keep up
normal lives.
A Sunday driving ban began as an emergency
measure to save gas. It was treated by most
Dutchmen as a chance to bicycle down the highway.
And on an ordinary weekday, roads are crowded as
ever.
But the signs of an inevitable industrial
slowdown are beginning to multiply. Gas rationing
starts next Saturday. Short-time work schedules
have arrived. The experts predict zero growth or
worse for the 1974 economy.
Under government limitations, oil supplies
reaching industry have been cut. back to 30 percent
below normal levels.
"The effect will be felt by our total economy,"
said an industry association spokesman. "And even
if the Arabs end the embargo, it will take weeks
before things are back to normal."
MIT Study May Aid Africans
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — What started as a seminar
project on a back lot of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology may help tribesmen in
drought-stricken West Africa save water.
Five college students are going to Mali this week
to demonstrate a water-storage technique they
developed to change mud or clay granaries into
water collection and storage tanks.
Dr. Hans Guggenheim and his students will take
their ideas to the Dogon tribe and attempt to show
how traditionaM Dogon architecture can be adapted
for modern purposes.

Birth Control Funds Inadequate
NEW YORK — Ford Foundation and Rockefeller
Foundation officials said Sunday that financial
support for research in birth control is "entirely
inadequate."
Because of declining financial support, the
officials said, it may not be possible to take
advantage of the advances in fundamental
understanding of human reproduction made during
the last 10 years.
Basic findings in biology that may not be
utilized, foundation officials said, concern chemical
details of the way the brain controls reproductive
functions through the pituitary gland, the role of
chemical mediators of hormone action, and the role
of the genetic machinery in the chemical and
physiological action of hormones.

"To use these advances in knowledge for
improved methods of fertility control," the officials
said, "increased levels of expenditures are required."
Dutch Face Gas Rationing
AMSTERDAM — After 10 weeks of a total Arab
oil embargo, Dutchmen face gasoline rationing,
reduced work weeks and the prospect of a sharp
cutback in industrial production.
Nevertheless, they are struggling to keep up
normal lives.
A Sunday driving ban began as an emergency
measure to save gas. It was treated by most
Dutchmen as a chance to bicycle down the highway.
And on an ordinary weekday, roads are crowded as
ever.
But the signs of an inevitable industrial
slowdown are beginning to multiply. Gas rationing
starts next Saturday. Short-time work schedules
have arrived. The experts predict zero growth or
worse for the 1974 economy.
Under government limitations, oil supplies
reaching industry have been cut. back to 30 percent
below normal levels.
"The effect will be felt by our total economy,"
said an industry association spokesman. "And even
if the Arabs end the embargo, it will take weeks
before things are back to normal."

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — What started as a seminar

Troops Seal London Airport
LONDON — Troops and tanks sealed off London
airport for the second straight day yesterday amid
reports that CIA and other intelligence agencies
believe up to 20 terrorist attacks are imminent in
Europe.
"Several terrorist groups who do not share a
common aim are involved and evidence has emerged
that suggests there is growing cooperation among
them," the Sunday Times said without elaborating.
Meanwhile, an American girl detained at
Heathrow Airport Friday during investigations into
international arms smuggling flew to New York, the
Home Office said. It identified her as Robin Orban
of San Diego, a model, but stressed she was not
being deported because she had never formally
entered Britain.
On her arrival at Kennedy Airport, Orban, 25,
was taken to a private room at the Trans World
Airlines terminal for questioning by three FBI
agents, according to TWA officials.
An FBI spokesman said the agency "was not in a
position yet to comment" on the questioning.
Three persons said by detectives to be her
"known associates" — Allison Thompson, 18, of
Santa Barbara, Calif., Abdelkhir el-Hakkaoui, 25, of
Morocco, and Athar Naseem, 21, of Pakistan — were
charged Saturday with conspiracy relating to the
possession of firearms and continued without bail
until Jan. 14.
Arabs Risk U.S. Use Of Force
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense James R.
Schlesinger says Arab nations risk increasing U.S.
public demand for force against them if they carry
their oil embargo too far.
"I think that that is a risk," Schlesinger said.
However, the defense chief said he does not
believe it will come to that because the
oil-producing states already have indicated an easing
of pressure by increasing the flow to some European
countries and Japan.
"We should recognize that the independent
powers of sovereign states should not be used in
such a way as would cripple the larger mass of the
industrialized world," Schlesinger said in an
interview recorded for broadcast on public
television stations tonight.

"That is running too high a risk and it is a source
of danger, I think, not only from our standpoint,
but from the standpoint of the oil-producing
nations."
At the same time, Schlesinger said, "the
alleviation of pressure" represented by a 10 percent
increase in oil output announced last month "is an
indication that the oil-producing states recognize
their common interests with the industrialized
world."

there were "brief but intense exchanges on the east

common aim are involved and evidence has emerged
that suggests there is growing cooperation among
them," the Sunday Times said without elaborating.
Meanwhile, an American girl detained at
Heathrow Airport Friday during investigations into
international arms smuggling flew to New York, the
Home Office said. It identified her as Robin Orban
of San Diego, a model, but stressed she was not
being deported because she had never formally
entered Britain.
On her arrival at Kennedy Airport, Orban, 25,
was taken to a private room at the Trans World
Airlines terminal for questioning by three FBI
agents, according to TWA officials.
An FBI spokesman said the agency "was not in a
position yet to comment" on the questioning.
Three persons said by detectives to be her
"known associates" — Allison Thompson, 18, of
Santa Barbara, Calif., Abdelkhir el-Hakkaoui, 25, of
Morocco, and Athar Naseem, 21, of Pakistan — were
charged Saturday with conspiracy relating to the
possession of firearms and continued without bail
until Jan. 14.
Arabs Risk U.S. Use Of Force
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense James R.
Schlesinger says Arab nations risk increasing U.S.
public demand for force against them if they carry
their oil embargo too far.
"I think that that is a risk," Schlesinger said.
However, the defense chief said he does not
believe it will come to that because the
oil-producing states already have indicated an easing
of pressure by increasing the flow to some European
countries and Japan.
"We should recognize that the independent
powers of sovereign states should not be used in
such a way as would cripple the larger mass of the
industrialized world," Schlesinger said in an
interview recorded for broadcast on public
television stations tonight.

"That is running too high a risk and it is a source
of danger, I think, not only from our standpoint,
but from the standpoint of the oil-producing
nations."
At the same time, Schlesinger said, "the
alleviation of pressure" represented by a 10 percent
increase in oil output announced last month "is an
indication that the oil-producing states recognize
their common interests with the industrialized
world."
Mideast Fighting Flares Again
Units of Egypt's 2nd Army have been trying to
consolidate a 200-yard advance on the east bank of
the Suez Canal and the Israelis have been trying to
drive them back, the U.N. Emergency Force said
yesterday.
Spokesman Birger Hallden told newsmen in Cairo
there were "brief but intense exchanges on the east
bank" 3'/2 miles southeast of Qantara on Friday,
"where according to U.N. commanders the positions
of the parties appeared to be unstable."
Questioned by newsmen, Hallden could not say
what use of the word unstable meant in military
terms. But he said it did not imply the cease-fire was
breaking down in that area.
On Tuesday Egyptian forces were reported to
have moved forward 200 yards in this area and
planted land mines. Later the Egyptians canceled a
meeting with U.N. field commanders to discuss a
withdrawal.
Birth Control Funds Inadequate
NEW YORK — Ford Foundation and Rockefeller
Foundation officials said Sunday that financial
support for research in birth control is "entirely
inadequate."
Because of declining financial support, the
officials said, it may not be possible to take
advantage of the advances in fundamental
understanding of human reproduction made during
the last 10 years.
Basic findings in biology that may not be
utilized, foundation officials said, concern chemical
details of the way the brain controls reproductive
functions through the pituitary gland, the role of
chemical mediators of hormone action, and the role
of the genetic machinery in the chemical and
physiological action of hormones.

"To use these advances in knowledge for
improved methods of fertility control," the officials
said, "increased levels of expenditures are required."
Dutch Face Gas Rationing
AMSTERDAM — After 10 weeks of a total Arab
oil embargo, Dutchmen face gasoline rationing,
reduced work weeks and the prospect of a sharp
cutback in industrial production.
Nevertheless, they are struggling to keep up
normal lives.
A Sunday driving ban began as an emergency
measure to save gas. It was treated by most
Dutchmen as a chance to bicycle down the highway.
And on an ordinary weekday, roads are crowded as
ever.
But the signs of an inevitable industrial
slowdown are beginning to multiply. Gas rationing
starts next Saturday. Short-time work schedules
have arrived. The experts predict zero growth or
worse for the 1974 economy.
Under government limitations, oil supplies
reaching industry have been cut. back to 30 percent
below normal levels.
"The effect will be felt by our total economy,"
said an industry association spokesman. "And even
if the Arabs end the embargo, it will take weeks
before things are back to normal."
MIT Study May Aid Africans
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — What started as a seminar
project on a back lot of the Massachusetts Institute
