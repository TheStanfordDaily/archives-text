# University's Energy Consumption Drops

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
University energy consumption
dropped sharply during the Nov.
1-Dec. 20 period compared to the
same time last year, according to
figures released by Plant Services
Director Dan DeYoung.
Although the figures reflected only
the first five days of the 20-day
holiday shutdown of academic
buildings and most residences, use of
natural gas and oil declined by 16.3
percent, while electricity use fell 20.8
percent.
The total amount of energy saved
over the vacation won't be known
until about Jan. 20, when meter
readings will again be taken.
DeYoung yesterday attributed the
decline to "the kind of response we've
received from the community," both
in decreasing its energy consumption
and in "accepting some of the things
we have had to do," such as turning
down some blowers and removing
some 2000 flourescent light tubes
from buildings.
Wasteful In Past
"The fact is that we've been overlit
for some time, and we've been
wasteful in the past in our use of
heat," DeYoung said. "We've been so
extravagant that it's probably very
good that we have had to take a long
look at our consumption."
However, DeYoung noted, "we
have not cut back any exterior lighting
or security lighting, and we don't
intend to."
DeYoung said that because the
campus used less electricity for the
Nov. 1-Dec. 20 period, the dollar cost
rose only 5.3 percent over last year
despite substantial rate hikes since
then.
Energy Decline
The electricity decline was nearly
triple the area-wide decline of seven
percent reported by Pacific Gas and
Electric, and a University statement
said the drop brought the campus back
to its December, 1968 level of
consumption.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larrv Horton said yesterday that he

was "surprised at how remarkably
smoothly things seemed to go" with
the interim student housing
arrangement. However, he said he
would have to wait to make a final
evaluation of the program until more
students have returned.
DeYoung said yesterday that while
some closed buildings had to be heated
for maintenance workers, on the
whole the shutdown of academic
buildings and most residences was "95
percent effective in conserving
electricity and 85 percent effective for
heat."
PG&E interrupted gas service to the
University for 24 hours beginning last
Thursday night, forcing the use of
reserve oil supplies. However,
DeYoung said the University still has
about seven days' reserve supply of oil,
which he termed "very comfortable."
However, he revealed that planning
is going ahead for next year, when,
PG&E has estimated, service may be
interrupted for as much as 21 days.
DeYoung said an advisory panel
composed of representatives appointed
by the various University vice
presidents will begin meeting
"probably within the month" to map
out plans to cope with possible severe
shortages next winter.

DeYoung noted that the energy
situation has also created "a large
question mark" for the University
budget. Fuel oil prices have nearly
tripled, and there is a possibility that
they may rise even more. "We're
talking here of in the neighborhood of
$100,000 to $200,000, but the biggest
problem is the uncertainty."
