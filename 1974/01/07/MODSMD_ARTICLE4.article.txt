# Foothills Park Remains Closed To Non-Residents Of Palo Alto
## 
### MARY PICKETT 
Foothills Park, an open space
nature preserve located near the
campus, will remain closed to non-Palo
Alto residents, the City Council
unanimously voted last month. That
means Stanford students living on
campus will be excluded.
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) challenged the city's exclusive
use policy, which has been in effect
since the Park was dedicated in the
early 60s.
In a phone interview Larry Sleizer,
chairman of the midpeninsula chapter
of the ACLU, said, "The effect of the
original decision has prevented blacks
from East Palo Alto and students from
using the park."
Sleizer contended that because city
employees who don't reside in Palo
Alto and their families are allowed to
use the park, it should be open to the
public.
"Discrimination against

non-residents is unlawful," he claimed.
"The ACLU is considering a lawsuit
against the city to open the park."
City Councilman Alan Henderson,
whose finance and public works
committee recommended the park
remain closed to non-Palo Altans, said
the original policy was decided by the
citizens of Palo Alto through a
referendum when the idea of the park
was initiated. That vote was the main
reason for the council's decision to
continue the limited access to the
park.
Part of the land used for the park
was given to the city, but city funds
purchased the rest of the acreage.
"Any change in policy should come
about through a vote of Palo Alto
residents," said Henderson.
Citing other reasons for the City
Council vote, Henderson said that
because of the fragile nature of
Foothills Park, it can only

accommodate 2000 people a day.
That limit has now been reached on
weekends with only Palo Altans using
the park, he said.
Henderson added that residents of
the city have a "proprietary feeling"
about the park that non-residents
would not have. There is a great
difference between the maintenance
cost of Foothills Park and other city
parks because there is less vandalism
and general damage, he added.
Law Prof. Byron Sher, another
council member, pointed out that
Foothills Park is the only park closed
to the general public. All other city
parks are open.
The Midpeninsula Regional Park
District will be establishing parks
similar to Foothills in the same area
which would be open to everyone,
Sher said.

see the Foothills Park pond. The Palo Alto City Council voted last month to
limit admittance to the park to city residents only.
c» uncil, Sher said thit the committee
heard from a numbtr of Palo Alto
residents who wantej the park to
remain restricted.
Referring to the aCLU's charge
that permiting city employees to use
the park invalidated tin exclusive use
policy, Henderson said this privilege
was part of a bargain made with city
employees when their contract was
renewed last summer.
Justifying the council's vote for
ecological reasons, Councilman John
Berwald said the entire foothills are

fragile. There is slippage of the
unstable soil layers and stream banks
are eroding. The stream running
through Foothills Park might erode
away until it is just "a big ditch" said
Berwald.
Allowing more people into the park
would also increase the fire hazard of
the area, he said.
Located six miles from the
Stanford campus, Foothills Park is a
1500-acre mountain reserve with 16
miles of hiking trails, an artificial pond
and picnic tables.

Referring to the aCLU's charge
that permiting city employees to use
the park invalidated tin exclusive use
policy, Henderson said this privilege
was part of a bargain made with city
employees when their contract was
renewed last summer.
Justifying the council's vote for
ecological reasons, Councilman John
Berwald said the entire foothills are

fragile. There is slippage of the
unstable soil layers and stream banks
are eroding. The stream running
through Foothills Park might erode
away until it is just "a big ditch" said
Berwald.
Allowing more people into the park
would also increase the fire hazard of
the area, he said.
Located six miles from the
Stanford campus, Foothills Park is a
1500-acre mountain reserve with 16
miles of hiking trails, an artificial pond
and picnic tables.
Foothills Park, an open space
nature preserve located near the
campus, will remain closed to non-Palo
Alto residents, the City Council
unanimously voted last month. That
means Stanford students living on
campus will be excluded.
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) challenged the city's exclusive
use policy, which has been in effect
since the Park was dedicated in the
early 60s.
In a phone interview Larry Sleizer,
chairman of the midpeninsula chapter
of the ACLU, said, "The effect of the
original decision has prevented blacks
from East Palo Alto and students from
using the park."
Sleizer contended that because city
employees who don't reside in Palo
Alto and their families are allowed to
use the park, it should be open to the
public.
"Discrimination against

non-residents is unlawful," he claimed.
"The ACLU is considering a lawsuit
against the city to open the park."
City Councilman Alan Henderson,
whose finance and public works
committee recommended the park
remain closed to non-Palo Altans, said
the original policy was decided by the
citizens of Palo Alto through a
referendum when the idea of the park
was initiated. That vote was the main
reason for the council's decision to
continue the limited access to the
park.
Part of the land used for the park
was given to the city, but city funds
purchased the rest of the acreage.
"Any change in policy should come
about through a vote of Palo Alto
residents," said Henderson.
Citing other reasons for the City
Council vote, Henderson said that
because of the fragile nature of
Foothills Park, it can only

accommodate 2000 people a day.
That limit has now been reached on
weekends with only Palo Altans using
the park, he said.
Henderson added that residents of
the city have a "proprietary feeling"
about the park that non-residents
would not have. There is a great
difference between the maintenance
cost of Foothills Park and other city
parks because there is less vandalism
and general damage, he added.
Law Prof. Byron Sher, another
council member, pointed out that
Foothills Park is the only park closed
to the general public. All other city
parks are open.
The Midpeninsula Regional Park
District will be establishing parks
similar to Foothills in the same area
which would be open to everyone,
Sher said.
