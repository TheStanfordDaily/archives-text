# Chapin Relaxed Despite Four Indictments
## 
### JIM WASCHER Special to the Daily 
WINNETKA, 111. â€” The former White House
aide smiles, eases back on the sofa and says"I
have four indictments against me today for
perjury before a grand jury in April."
For a man whose entire future may be in
jeopardy, Dwight L. Chapin appears remarkably
relaxed. He jokes frequently and says he
wanted to attend Stanford, but enrolled at USC
instead when his future wife made the trek
south.
Chapin, who served as President Nixon's
appointments secretary during Nixon's first
term, was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Washington on Nov. 29 for denying that he had
any official ties with convicted "dirty trickster"
Donald Segretti.
If convicted, he faces up to five years'
imprisonment on each of the four counts and
could be fined as much as $10,000.
Although he doesn't consider himself "a
victim of the Watergate," Chapin admits that
the "affair has affected me, it has affected my
family and it has affected my relationship with
my friends.
"Looking back on it,"he continues, "It has
had its moments of anguish and " of

disappointment, but I'm probably a very lucky
individual to have had the experience of being
exposed to it and knowing people that are so
deeply involved in it, both from an educational
point of view and also in terms of appreciating
to a much greater degree the value of our
system and the way that it works."
Chapin, whose trial is scheduled to begin
Feb. 19 before U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gessell, insists that he is innocent. He has hired
Jacob Stine, a prominent criminal lawyer, to
defend him. Chapin spends three or four days a
week in Washington preparing for the trial.
According to Chapin, "the perjury counts
are strictly a function of my character in a
grand jury situation and are even a step
removed from the Segretti affair." He appears
confident of acquittal and says that "hopefully,
once I get this trial over with, I can get back to
my job." (He is currently on leave without pay
from his position as director of market planning
for United Air Lines.)
Wrongly Accused
Despite his belief that he has been wrongly
accused, Chapin does not think that the grand
jury or the media have victimized him unfairly.
"I think that anybody that had been a part of
the Administration would find themselves
under a microscope."
Analyzing what he believes to be one of the

more unfortunate aspects of the Watergate
affair, Chapin points out that figures implicated
in the case by the press "are immediatejy
assumed guilty and not innocent until proven
guilty. You are almost indicted the day you hit
the news."
"That's not a fault of the media," Chapin
says,"It just is a fault of the way we are
thinking now. It's something to look into later
on."
Chapin is less complimentary about the press
when it comes to reports which allege that
President Nixon is advised almost solely by his
press secretary, Ronald Ziegler, and his chief of
staff, Gen. Alexander M. Haig. "I don't believe
that's a valid criticism because I don't think
anybody knows for a fact who all he's talking
to."
'Wide Range'
Recalling his tenure as Nixon's appointments
secretary, Chapin says,"The President gets a
tremendous amount of information from a
wide range of staff and outside people in the
form of memorandums. He is much different
than President Johnson, who preferred to be
told things rather than reading them."
An important aspect of Chapin's job was
"making sure that the people who need to see
the President most are the ones that get in to

see him. Everybody is after his time, and there's
a limit as to how many hours are available."
Despite the limit on the number of people
who are able to see the President, Chapin thinks
"this whole isolation myth is just that. It's been
used by his critics as a sledgehammer to attack
him."
Aide's Duty
According to Chapin, he perceived it as the
duty of a good aide "to protect his boss from
any kind of embarrassment and, in politics, to
protect him from political embarrassment. But
I don't believe that to the exclusion of warning
him when there's a problem."
He adds that "the aide must step up to the
boss and tell him what's up at the right time. If
he doesn't do that, he's not worth his salt."
Chapin thinks "the great error in this Watergate
fiasco" is that none of those involved "stepped
up" to Nixon.
Even so, Chapin says,"I feel strongly that
the President will survive this ordeal, and come
through with flying colors. There's no question
in my mind that there are valuable lessons in
this Watergate thing, as tragic as it is for people
and for families. It may end up being a very
healthy thing for the country. It may make
Nixon into a better President than he ever
would have been without it."
