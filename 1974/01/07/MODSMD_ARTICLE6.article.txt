Stanford students are charged for
the "privilege" of listing any housing
space which they might have with the
Stanford Off-Campus Housing Office.
There is already a notorious lack of
adequate housing available to Stanford
students at grossly inflated prices, and
our niggardly University has the
audacity to imply that it is so destitute
that it must charge its own students a
fee if they wish to list housing which
they might have to rent or share with
the Housing Office.
Since students are already at the
bottom of the financial totem pole in
the academic community, they are the
least likely to be willing to pay such a
fee. Thereby, the Housing Office
makes knowledge of available housing
that much less available to those who
are seeking housing, and further limits
its already sparse listings. Is Stanford
really so near bankruptcy that it must
charge its own students for the
privilege of filling out two cards for
filing and display in the Housing
Office, which was set up to serve
Stanford students and offer at least
minor aid in the solution of a
significant student problem?

Irresponsible Journalism
Editor:
In your article, on Asst. Prof.
Renato Rosaldo (Dec. 6, 1973), one
sentence stands out: "His students and
colleagues praise him highly and in a
way that merges the categories of
'teacher' and 'person'." Perhaps we
note this sentence because throughout
the article you manage to categorize
those people you mention in ways that
deny them their humanity.
The use of Douglas
Mac Arthur's motto in connection with
Rosaldo's fieldwork is tasteless, in
addition to being incorrect. In the text
the Ilongot culture, here so jocularly
summed up in 'headhunter,' is
described as "incredibly rich and
rewarding" — but only in a direct
quote from Rosaldo more than
halfway through the article, only after
repeated references to 'headhunter,'
'fierce headhunters,' and
'decapitation.'
Closer to home (and more within
the specifically mandated concerns of
our committee, for which I am
writing), Asst. Prof. Michelle Rosaldo
— to whom you refer repeatedly as
"wife," notably as "the first-year
Harvard graduate student in
Anthropology" that Professor Renato
Rosaldo married — is nowhere in your
article accorded even the minimal
academic courtesy of full
identification by her current faculty
title.
The point we wish to emphasize is
not that Professor Michelle Rosaldo
ought — or ought not — to be
mentioned. The point is that she IS
mentioned, in an article dealing largely
with professional matters, entirely
without reference to her professional
standing and experience. She holds a

Ph.D. from Harvard, awarded on the
basis of her own, independently
funded field work in the Philippines,
and is reputed to be among the best
young scholars in the field of
anthropology. Your final reference to
her — Professor Renato Rosaldo
"succeeded in wringing out a position
(at Stanford) for Michelle" — is
stupidly offensive, not only to her, but
to the entire University community.
Actually, the Department and the
School of Humanities and Sciences
were pleased to have her join the
faculty. They "bent over backwards"
only to approve a work assignment
system which allows both of them to
function effectively on the faculty.
Women in universities do face
traditional prejudices; not the least of
them problems stems from the time
honored practice where job candidates
are married to each other, of hiring the
husband as full member of the faculty
and the wife as a lecturer, if she is
hired at all. Many people throughout
the University are committed to
changing the traditional attitudes and
practices that linger on, and are all too
obviously reflected in your article. The
continuing problem deserves full and
thoughtful exploration and discussion
in a public forum. Regrettably, the
Daily has offered us none.
This sort of journalism is
insensitive, irresponsible — and just
plain incompetent. We recommend
that, not only the writer of the article
but also the editorial staff which
passed on it and printed it, make to
your journalism that "personal
commitment of time and empathy"
for which you praise Renato Rosaldo.
Any such commitment is painfully
lacking in your article.

Inaccurate Reporting
Editor:
The Daily article (Dec. 6, 1973)
about my husband, Renato, was so
patronizing in its characterization of
the people we studied, and insulting to
my husband and myself, that I hoped
that no one would take it seriously.
But misleading journalism does,
unfortunately, influence general
opinions, and so I find it necessary,
specifically, to deny that I ever said or
implied that my husband "doggedly"
"wrung" my present appointment out
of the University.
Spouses who are both professionals
confront a difficult situation in the
search for employment, and I am
deeply grateful that the University and
the Department of Anthropology
demonstrated flexible and concerned
cooperation in opening a position I
could fill. At the same time, my
appointment to that position was
determined by my own qualifications
rather than my husband's efforts. Any
implications to the contrary are
detrimental not only to my own
self-respect, but more importantly, to
that of other individuals who find
themselves in a position like my own.
