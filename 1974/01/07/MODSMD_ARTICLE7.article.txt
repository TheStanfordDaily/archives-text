## The
						Fire Has Not Ceased In Vietnam

A recent Gallup poll shows Henry Kissinger as
this country's "most admired man" with Richard
Nixon close behind. In view of the Watergate
scandals and the sorry state of the economy, the
American people can only admire the Nixon
Administration for its policy of detente (which
failed to prevent a nuclear alert against Russia) and,
even more important, its achievement of "peace
with honor" in Vietnam. Hoping to divert public
attention from Watergate, Nixon and Kissinger in
their public appearances never fail to stress the
"positive achievements" of their first term,
especially the Vietnam settlement.
The tragedy is that the American people believe
this Administration when it tells them in effect that
"war is peace." Last November, in the same week
that Nixon boasted at a press conference that he
had "ended" the war, the Saigon government
reported over 50,000 Vietnamese deaths since the
ceasefire. And the numbers have risen steadily since.
The cruel deception that the war has "ended" or
that the US is "out" of Vietnam has been exposed
countless times in the American press, despite its
almost total reliance on censored reports from US
and Saigon official sources.
Hours after the ceasefire took effect last January
28, CBS took a camera crew into a PRG held village
in the Mekong Delta. Every house flew the PRG flag
so that observers could make no mistake as to where
sympathies lay in this long-time rebel stronghold.
The television showed a thriving town, its people
celebrating the long-awaited peace. The next day
CBS returned to the town. It was now a mass of
smoking ruins. South Vietnamese jets had
repeatedly bombed the village with napalm and high
explosives, and soldiers from Saigon were occupying
the area to prevent disorder. Thus ended a few
hours of "peace" for a Vietnamese village.
Hundreds of such violations by Saigon —
attempts to regain land lost shortly before the
ceasefire — were reported in the American media.
Almost immediately, Thieu declared that he would
"arrest or shoot on the spot" anyone suspected of
working with the PRG. He decreed death sentences
for anyone distributing PRG flags or engaging in
political activities sponsored by "pro-Communist or
neutralist elements." Thieu's own aides have
acknowledged that from the beginning, "he was
intent upon frustrating the political provisions of
the peace agreement with Hanoi and the Viet
Cong." To this end he broke off negotiations with
PRG representatives aiming at future national
elections. But his most important violations have
been military.

Only a few weeks after the ceasefire, Saigon
officials admitted that their air force, the fourth
largest in the world, was conducting between 200
and 300 air strikes a day against PRG-held territory.
These planes attacked such varied targets as a
peacekeeping headquarters under construction in
the Central Highlands and a hospital for former
Vietcong POW's. In the latter attack, thousands of
people were reportedly killed or wounded by
napalm and high explosives dropped in a half mile
area surrounding the hospital. Such action was in
line with Thieu's promise in early March, as
reported by AP, to "push the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong back to positions they held before the
ceasefire. This could account for such government
offensive operations as those Saigon classifies as
'security defense missions.' "
In the crucial northerly Binh Dinh province,
according to the Washington Post, the South
Vietnamese air force, Navy, and elite troops have,
since the ceasefire, engaged in a massive offensive to
wrest control of the land away from the PRG.
"Caught by the January ceasefire agreement with
little more than the shoulders of the main
north-south highway under their control, the South
Vietnamese are now pushing the Communists back
and are beginning to repopulate villages that were
lost in the Easter offensive of 1972." Military
commanders and Saigon officials admitted that their
operations were offensive and had begun after a
year of peace in the area. "Asked if the military
campaign here was a violation of the Paris peace
agreement," the Saigon field commander replied,
"Sure it is." The military campaign uprooted
thousands of peasants at harvest time who "are now
camped in wretched huts along highway 1."
As Thieu put it on October 1, "To ensure peace,
we must not sit around and let the Communists
attack us. In order to preserve peace, we must
actively prevent the Communists from violating it."
His attitude would account for the fact that "Saigon
troops have taken advantage of their superior
firepower and have been shelling at a much higher
rate than the Communists," according to the Los
Angeles Times. It would also account for the
inevitably lopsided casualty reports that issue from
Saigon command headquarters. Even US officials
are quoted as admitting that Saigon always wins its
"defensive operations" because they are in reality
"preemptive operations."
In one typical incident in the Mekong Delta,
Saigon claimed 29 Viet Cong soldiers killed to its
one, despite its other claim that the Viet Cong

attacked first. The LA Times received a confidential
American battlefield report which read: "23rd
ARVN division ... received firm intelligence on
location of VC battalion-sized training center in
north-western Phu My district, picked best company
in 40th regiment for action, and made detailed plan
for raid."
Although the Peace Agreement called for
freedom of movement in southern Vietnam, Saigon
systematically violates this provision for fear of the
political consequences. Literally millions of
resettled peasants still inhabit "relocation" or
concentration camps under guard by Thieu's forces,
unable to return to their land. And the Saigon
government continues to draw more people under
its rule.
On August 20, for example, the New York Times
reported on a "huge, forced resettlement in the
Mekong Delta." At least 16,000 peasants were
forcibly evicted from their land. "The primary
objective of the resettlement.. . has been to deny
population to the Viet Cong as the possibility of a
political settlement and eventual national elections
appeared on the political horizon."
Most independent reports by neutral observers
(from Agence France Presse, Reuters, Asahi
Shimbun, Le Monde, Far Eastern Economic Review,
etc.) 'indicate that the PRG forces were remarkably
controlled after the ceasefire in the face of literally
hundreds of documented violations by Thieu's
forces. They were under strict orders to respect the
terms of the agreement, if only because they had
the most to gain from seeing the United States live
up to its terms also.
But the fiction of peace can no longer be
maintained. Unable to carry on a political struggle
against an opponent who replied with military
force, the PRG finally ordered its troops on October
15 to defend the government against Saigon's
assaults. The French paper Le Monde commented
that day that "it now appears that the moment has
perhaps arrived when the PRG, exhausted by the
political stalemate and tired of the attacks of its
adversary, has... decided to return the attacks
blow by blow."
Thieu is now preparing his subjects for a long
drawn out war in response to his predicted "North
Vietnamese offensive." But sophisticated observers
in Saigon, according to the New York Times, "think
that Thieu is simply trying to distract his people
from their sharpening economic plight, camouflage
his army's own offensive actions and use the
atmosphere of crisis to reshuffle his top command."
There is no more "shaky" peace in Vietnam; there is
only war.
