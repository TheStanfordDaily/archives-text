# Reject Nixon's 'Amerika’
## Where Is Stanford Counter-Culture Now? 
### 
R.W. Dougl as

Stanford University, Dec. 1, 1973. It's Saturday night — the Saturday before
dead week. The campus is restless. None but the staunchest pre-med could drag
himself into the library tonight. It's the night to really get your ya yas out
before settling down to the grind of finals. It's been a cold autumn at Stanford.
News of an impending energy crisis makes it even colder. Walter Cronkite is
telling us that "the experts" say a full-scale depression is just around the corner.
Confidence in the president is at an all-time low. America is bewildered and
upset.
You put that all together, and what do you get? Albert King will tell you:
"You got the BLUES!!"
And what do you do when you got the blues??? You shout 'em out, shake
'em loose, and boogie till the cows come home with some of that good old rock
and roll blues music! At least that's what we used to do.
But times have indeed changed at Stanford University. It's now 1974, not
1970. Back then, under the above circumstances, a concert in Maples Pavillion
featuring some of the most talented blues musicians available (Hot Tuna, Albert
King, and the Bloomfield/Naftalin group) would have packed them in. People
would line up for two hours in the rain to get the best seats. But not on Dec. 1,
1973. The concert didn't even break even.
How did that happen? It was well-advertised. It wasn't too expensive — no
more than Winterland, and so much closer. Maples is a great place for a concert
(where else can you find a bouncing floor?). The answer must simply be that
Stanford people aren't into that kind of music anymore. 0.K., people are
entitled to their own musical tastes. But unfortunately, I fear that we may be
dealing with much more than a question of aesthetic preferences.
Remember The Sixties?
Think back, for a moment, to the glorious sixties. Remember? There was
plenty of everything in the Great Society, and America was cruisin' for burgers.
Everyone was talking about the "youth rebellion." Surely you remember the
Woodstock Generation.

We can change the world!
Rearrange the world ...
is DYING
If you believe in justice,
And if you believe in freedom,
Let a man live his own life!
Rules and regulations,
Who needs them????
Throw em out the door ....
—Graham Nash, 1970
There were millions of 'em — young, idealistic, well-educated, willing to try
anything — the Dr. Spock, World War II babies. The world was full of injustice,
and we were going to set it straight with love, peace, and good vibrations. People
were looking for a new answer, a better vision.
This "movement" manifested itself in many ways. There were the mass
anti-war demonstrations and"the Revolution." There was the turned-on world
of the drug culture, and the spiritual bliss of meditation, Hare Krishna, and
Christ Jesus. People started living communally, returning to more "organic"
lifestyles.
The places where all of these aspects of the counter-culture came together
most clearly were rock and roll concerts. The big festivals like Woodstock made
the most noise, but the same spirit was found in small bars and big auditoriums
throughout the land. Rock and roll musicians like Graham Nash became
prophets and saints. His lyrics (above) as incredibly naive as they are, expressed
the sentiments of many people. The pigs were bashing in heads in Chicago for no
good reason, and we weren't going to stand for it!
More Than Foolishness
Some called it adolescent foolishness. But it was and is much more than that.
Maybe we were naive, but at least we were doing some thing. I really don't think
that all those political demonstrations were futile. If nothing else, they brought
us all together, let us know that there were millions of other people who were
infuriated by our government's deeds. Even if we were completely ineffective
politically (which is extremely doubtful), the spiritual uplifting we all got from
those demonstrations made them more than worthwhile.
Barry Goldwater was right on the nose when he called it a communist
conspiracy. But it wasn't due to foreign infiltration. It was and is a grassroots,
American-as-apple-pie rebirth of the revolutionary spirit. For some, surely, it was
only a game of empty words and slogans. But many of us took it all very
seriously. The money-grubbing, imperialist policies of this country are evil. And
there's a whole lot of us freaks who aren't going to sell out to it.
But this is the realistic seventies. We've got to get down to business. The spirit
of the counter-culture is still alive. It's just a little older. The sixties were a time
of flamboyant display, but the seventies will require serious hard work. It's time
to get our own individual lives in order. But we've got to do it differently. And
it's happening: Free clinics, food conspiracies, communal living, life based on a
doctrine of reaching out and integration rather than isolation and
differentiation.
Come Together
But we still need to know we're not alone. And that's why the small turnout
for Hot Tuna really hurt me. Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady have long been
at the forefront of the "rock and roll revolution." Jefferson Airplane told us to
"tear down the walls" when we thought that was the answer. Hot Tuna has a
mellower message: to stick tight with your real friends and keep that love energy
flowing. I was really sad that there weren't more Stanford people there to rejoice
in the music — to celebrate life and experience real communion through a bond
of common resistence to the pigs of the world. "Then you feel that true religion,
Hallejluuu."
But now I'm getting carried away. Rock and roll isn't the only way. Surely,
there is still some kind of counter-culture at Stanford. People can't be
complacent with Ri<?hard Nixon's Amerika. They must just react differently
now. So, someone please tell me: Where is the Stanford counter-culture these
days, and what is it doing? I'd really like to know. If the current generation of
undergraduates isn't into rock and roll, please tell me that it's into something
subversive. If we don't undermine this country's bad karma, who will?
