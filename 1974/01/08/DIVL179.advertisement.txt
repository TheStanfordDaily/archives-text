Sophomore Charles Walker Heywood was
among 31 passengers killed in a Palestinian
firebombing of a Pan American jetliner in
Rome Dec. 17. Heywood, 19, was returning
home to Dhahran Saudi Arabia, where his
father is employed by the Arabian-American
Oil Company (Aramco). Heywood's father was
to retire in March, so this was to be Heywood's
last visit to Arabia. Heywood, reportedly on the
verge of declaring a political science major,
lived at 225 Kipling, Palo Alto.
