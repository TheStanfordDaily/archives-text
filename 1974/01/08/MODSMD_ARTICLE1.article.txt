# Augsburger Questions Zone Plan
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Exemption of the University from
Santa Clara County's proposed "cs"
zone is justified because "the evils that
the ordinance is designed to correct do
not-exist on the Stanford campus,"
Robert Augsburger, vice president for
business and finance, told the County
Planning Commission at a hearing last
week.
The "cs" ordinance, if enacted,
would force all areas adjacent to
municipalities in the county to seek
annexation to those cities before
developing any new construction
projects.
Augsburger cited several reasons
why he believes that Stanford merits
exemption from the ordinance.
In addition to being a residential
university and a research institution,
Stanford's status as a private
institution means that its ability to
remain an independent,
self-determining institution is a
function of financial strength and
viability, Augsburger stated.
Broad Horizons
Also, Stanford is a "perpetual
institution" whose horizons are
measured in centuries rather than in
decades, he remarked.
Augsburger noted that Stanford is a
national and international resource
whose boundaries are confined to no
jurisdictional limits.
Although the University derives
benefits from its location and has
responsibilities to its neighbors, it is
also subject to demands which are
worldwide in character, Augsburger
emphasized.
At the hearing, Augsburger and
Harry Sanders, director of planning,
claimed that the evils the "cs" zone is
designed to correct don't exist on
Stanford's campus.
The University provides its own
municipal services, they stated. It has a
fire fighting force, a police force, and
44 miles of privately built roads and
10 miles of paths. But the University
has not indulged in the irresponsible
urban growth which the ordinance is
designed to halt, Augsburger and
Sanders declared.
Also, they pointed out that while
the ordinance was designed to preserve
open space, Stanford already preserves
more open space than any property
owner in the area. More than
two-thirds of its 8800 acres have been
held open.
Although the ordinance is designed
to improve land use planning, Stanford
has always planned its use of land
carefully, Sanders told the Planning
Commission.
Ever since the Olmstead Plan of
1886, the University has
conscientiously planned its
development, Sanders said. Stanford
still attempts to retain the best
features of the Olmstead Plan and
develops new construction projects
consistent with the existing
characteristics of the University, he
added.
Questionable Effects
The Palo Alto City Council
proposal that certain Stanford lands be
designated "urban service areas" so
that they can come under the
jurisdiction of the ordinance would
have questionable effects on
Stanford's planning if adopted,
Augsburger explained.
One of the areas the City Council
proposes to include in the "cs" zone is
the only significant piece of flat
academic land immediately adjacent to

the developed campus. The region,
extending from the Medical Center to
Willow Road, should be preserved
under the University's control
At the hearing. City Councilman
Alan Henderson and Planning Director
Naphtali Knox contended that
development of certain Stanford lands
could affect Palo Alto and therefore
should be under city jurisdiction.
The County Planning Commission
appointed a committee to study the
arguments of Stanford and Palo Alto.

proposes to include in the "cs" zone is
the only significant piece of flat
academic land immediately adjacent to

the developed campus. The region,
extending from the Medical Center to
Willow Road, should be preserved
under the University's control
At the hearing. City Councilman
Alan Henderson and Planning Director
Naphtali Knox contended that
development of certain Stanford lands
could affect Palo Alto and therefore
should be under city jurisdiction.
The County Planning Commission
appointed a committee to study the
arguments of Stanford and Palo Alto.
Exemption of the University from
Santa Clara County's proposed "cs"
zone is justified because "the evils that
the ordinance is designed to correct do
not-exist on the Stanford campus,"
Robert Augsburger, vice president for
business and finance, told the County
Planning Commission at a hearing last
week.
The "cs" ordinance, if enacted,
would force all areas adjacent to
municipalities in the county to seek
annexation to those cities before
developing any new construction
projects.
Augsburger cited several reasons
why he believes that Stanford merits
exemption from the ordinance.
In addition to being a residential
university and a research institution,
Stanford's status as a private
institution means that its ability to
remain an independent,
self-determining institution is a
function of financial strength and
viability, Augsburger stated.
Broad Horizons
Also, Stanford is a "perpetual
institution" whose horizons are
measured in centuries rather than in
decades, he remarked.
Augsburger noted that Stanford is a
national and international resource
whose boundaries are confined to no
jurisdictional limits.
Although the University derives
benefits from its location and has
responsibilities to its neighbors, it is
also subject to demands which are
worldwide in character, Augsburger
emphasized.
At the hearing, Augsburger and
Harry Sanders, director of planning,
claimed that the evils the "cs" zone is
designed to correct don't exist on
Stanford's campus.
The University provides its own
municipal services, they stated. It has a
fire fighting force, a police force, and
44 miles of privately built roads and
10 miles of paths. But the University
has not indulged in the irresponsible
urban growth which the ordinance is
designed to halt, Augsburger and
Sanders declared.
Also, they pointed out that while
the ordinance was designed to preserve
open space, Stanford already preserves
more open space than any property
owner in the area. More than
two-thirds of its 8800 acres have been
held open.
Although the ordinance is designed
to improve land use planning, Stanford
has always planned its use of land
carefully, Sanders told the Planning
Commission.
Ever since the Olmstead Plan of
1886, the University has
conscientiously planned its
development, Sanders said. Stanford
still attempts to retain the best
features of the Olmstead Plan and
develops new construction projects
consistent with the existing
characteristics of the University, he
added.
Questionable Effects
The Palo Alto City Council
proposal that certain Stanford lands be
designated "urban service areas" so
that they can come under the
jurisdiction of the ordinance would
have questionable effects on
Stanford's planning if adopted,
Augsburger explained.
