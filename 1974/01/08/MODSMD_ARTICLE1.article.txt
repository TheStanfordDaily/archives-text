# Augsburger Questions Zone Plan

### BILL ROSS 
Exemption of the University from
Santa Clara County's proposed "cs"
zone is justified because "the evils that
the ordinance is designed to correct do
not-exist on the Stanford campus,"
Robert Augsburger, vice president for
business and finance, told the County
Planning Commission at a hearing last
week.
The "cs" ordinance, if enacted,
would force all areas adjacent to
municipalities in the county to seek
annexation to those cities before
developing any new construction
projects.
Augsburger cited several reasons
why he believes that Stanford merits
exemption from the ordinance.
In addition to being a residential
university and a research institution,
Stanford's status as a private
institution means that its ability to
remain an independent,
self-determining institution is a
function of financial strength and
viability, Augsburger stated.
Broad Horizons
Also, Stanford is a "perpetual
institution" whose horizons are
measured in centuries rather than in
decades, he remarked.
Augsburger noted that Stanford is a
national and international resource
whose boundaries are confined to no
jurisdictional limits.
Although the University derives
benefits from its location and has
responsibilities to its neighbors, it is
also subject to demands which are
worldwide in character, Augsburger
emphasized.
At the hearing, Augsburger and
Harry Sanders, director of planning,
claimed that the evils the "cs" zone is
designed to correct don't exist on
Stanford's campus.
