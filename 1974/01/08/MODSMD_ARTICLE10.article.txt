## Tempered Dining Prevents Fat Politicians 
### 
Stanford students with children . . .
listen.
To change the government, to
re-introduce into the American system
the concepts of integrity and
legislation for the good of the people,
I hereby propose we carefully guide
the eating habits of our children so
that when they're about 40 years old
(and for the first time seriously
considered as presidential aspirants)
they won't be GLUTTONS! They will
be worthy of governing a country.
They will have known moderation.
Let me explain my vision of
table-train politics. Implicit in the
democratic credo is the assumption
that preserving liberty rests on the
ability of the people to maintain
effective checks on the wielders of
power. What this implies is the
importance of vigilance and moral
stamina of commoners like you and
me in watchdogging our government
officials.

Horro-s of Haldeman! What a bleak
prospect. I don't have time every day
to think through the slinky sophistry
of Nixon. Nor do I have the money to
keep up a steady chain of letters to my
Congressmen to keep them informed.
What I prefer to do is raise the boy
I'll someday have on a little meat, a
little potatoes. I'll want him well, lean
and lithe so he will be content with
modest amounts on his plate, so he
will have known moderation, and
disdain, yes disdain overeating.
My son, who will be president in 40
years, will think fat is the most
heinous mark of a politician and jog to
the White House each morning to rid
himself of dollops around the midriff
instead of summoning the limousine to
work. I only hope I live long enough
to see good government.
You may think this is all
balderdash, but I assure you, some
very fine chefs have worked through
the idea of table-train politics.

They all see at the core of
democracy men working for the public
good, placing country above
self-interest and seeking virtue to make
the system run. Lycurgus had sought
to avoid evil in ancient Sparta by
eliminating wealth itself. Where wealth
flourishes, he thought, luxury is sure
to follow, and after luxury . . . fat. He
was wrong in assuming he could
achieve liberty by squelching the rights
of men wishing to own property
because in doing so he undermined the
very basis of freedom itself. Scotch
Lycurgus.
Don't forget Rome. Governors
prostated themselves beside pools and
chomped lazily on grapes while less
fortunate men toiled madly about
them. Roman politicians rose from
their fat bumpies only in time to hear
the very last dinner bell. . . .
The moral torpitude that brought
liberty in Denmark to its knees in the
1600s, as Molesworth saw it, was the
sloth of corrupt nobles more
interested in using their privileges for
self-indulgence than for service to the
state. Wealth worked an evil effect in
crushing a nation. Brrrrrrr, that's
frightening.
A Working Republic
Our founding tathers were aware of
the necessities for a working republic.
They borrowed ideas from antiquity,
from Enlightenment thought, and
from the ailing British Constitution.
They socked away the best ideas for a
democratic experiment.
John Adams realized the delicacy
of the republican polity and the
difficulty in sustaining it. The problem
as he saw it was "... a Purification
from our Vices, and an Augmentation
of our Virtues or they will be no
Blessing." Is there no rest from FAT?
"Empires," declared one workhorse
of the constitutional era, "carry in
them their own bane, and proceed, in
fatal round, from virtuous industry
and velour, to wealth and conquest,
next to luxury, then to foul
corruption and bloated morals; and,
last to sloth, anarchy, slavery, and
political death."
"Bloated" and "sloth" ... did you
see that! What he really meant was fat.
Countries don't work with FAT
people!
Quality of Functions
How do countries work? Walter
Lippmann argues that the American
democracy sustains a duality of
functions, those of governing and
representing. We, the lackeys, rise to
glory only on election day by choosing

Mike Phillips

men for office who in turn represent
the public good. They are, according
to Lippmann, no simple alembics
distilling the people's wishes, but
enlightened men, governing as they see
fit, promoting the common good.
With the mountebanks we've placed
in office we've only complicated our
obligations because now we've got to
watch them as if they were about to
boil over. It's much simpler to have
honest kids, but I'm getting ahead of
myself. .. . Put men in office, says
Lippmann, to run the affairs. Theirs is
the governing function â€” let them do
it independently of the flack from
below.
What can the people do? "They can
elect the government," says Walt. "Or
they can remove it. They can approve
or disapprove its performance. But
they cannot administer the
government. They cannot themselves
perform. They cannot normally
initiate and propose the necessary
legislation. A mass cannot govern."
Can they impeach, Walt? I take that
back ... I guess that's not the point.
Health, Honesty, Discipline
What does good government
presuppose? There's only one
possibility in a democracy: Healthy
men, honest men, lean men. Right at
the center of the platter there has to
be a man, and I guess a lonely man,
above mundane concerns. He must at
the very least be intelligent, informed,
disciplined, bold, and I think even in
some cases, a smidgeon calloused,
because he must answer to his own
inward muttering at times when
popularity is against him.
He must catch hold of divine hints
and find clues intended for him alone.
He must be a man of duty without
hopes of personal gain nor of glory.
Above all he must have a sense of
history and eye the time beyond his
death in order to sense the magnitude
of his calling and the temporality of
wealth and luxury. He must be a man
of selflessness to better serve the
people. If you can wait 40 years more,
vote for my son. Or the boy next
door.
But in the meantime there's much
that we can do. We can take only what
we can comfortably eat. Our kids will
pick up the habit. We will save on food
bills. As a result our government in the
not so distant future will be trimmer
and stronger because we will start with
lean and honest assumptions.
We'll start with our children.

back ... I guess that's not the point.
Health, Honesty, Discipline
What does good government
presuppose? There's only one
possibility in a democracy: Healthy
men, honest men, lean men. Right at
the center of the platter there has to
be a man, and I guess a lonely man,
above mundane concerns. He must at
the very least be intelligent, informed,
disciplined, bold, and I think even in
some cases, a smidgeon calloused,
because he must answer to his own
inward muttering at times when
popularity is against him.
He must catch hold of divine hints
and find clues intended for him alone.
He must be a man of duty without
hopes of personal gain nor of glory.
Above all he must have a sense of
history and eye the time beyond his
death in order to sense the magnitude
of his calling and the temporality of
wealth and luxury. He must be a man
of selflessness to better serve the
people. If you can wait 40 years more,
vote for my son. Or the boy next
door.
But in the meantime there's much
that we can do. We can take only what
we can comfortably eat. Our kids will
pick up the habit. We will save on food
bills. As a result our government in the
not so distant future will be trimmer
and stronger because we will start with
lean and honest assumptions.
We'll start with our children.
(Mike Phillips is a graduate student in
communications.)
Stanford students with children . . .
listen.
To change the government, to
re-introduce into the American system
the concepts of integrity and
legislation for the good of the people,
I hereby propose we carefully guide
the eating habits of our children so
that when they're about 40 years old
(and for the first time seriously
considered as presidential aspirants)
they won't be GLUTTONS! They will
be worthy of governing a country.
They will have known moderation.
Let me explain my vision of
table-train politics. Implicit in the
democratic credo is the assumption
that preserving liberty rests on the
ability of the people to maintain
effective checks on the wielders of
power. What this implies is the
importance of vigilance and moral
stamina of commoners like you and
me in watchdogging our government
officials.

Horro-s of Haldeman! What a bleak
prospect. I don't have time every day
to think through the slinky sophistry
of Nixon. Nor do I have the money to
keep up a steady chain of letters to my
Congressmen to keep them informed.
What I prefer to do is raise the boy
I'll someday have on a little meat, a
little potatoes. I'll want him well, lean
and lithe so he will be content with
modest amounts on his plate, so he
will have known moderation, and
disdain, yes disdain overeating.
My son, who will be president in 40
years, will think fat is the most
heinous mark of a politician and jog to
the White House each morning to rid
himself of dollops around the midriff
instead of summoning the limousine to
work. I only hope I live long enough
to see good government.
You may think this is all
balderdash, but I assure you, some
very fine chefs have worked through
the idea of table-train politics.

They all see at the core of
democracy men working for the public
good, placing country above
self-interest and seeking virtue to make
the system run. Lycurgus had sought
to avoid evil in ancient Sparta by
eliminating wealth itself. Where wealth
flourishes, he thought, luxury is sure
to follow, and after luxury . . . fat. He
was wrong in assuming he could
achieve liberty by squelching the rights
of men wishing to own property
because in doing so he undermined the
very basis of freedom itself. Scotch
Lycurgus.
Don't forget Rome. Governors
prostated themselves beside pools and
chomped lazily on grapes while less
fortunate men toiled madly about
them. Roman politicians rose from
their fat bumpies only in time to hear
the very last dinner bell. . . .
The moral torpitude that brought
liberty in Denmark to its knees in the
1600s, as Molesworth saw it, was the
sloth of corrupt nobles more
interested in using their privileges for
self-indulgence than for service to the
state. Wealth worked an evil effect in
crushing a nation. Brrrrrrr, that's
frightening.
A Working Republic
Our founding tathers were aware of
the necessities for a working republic.
They borrowed ideas from antiquity,
from Enlightenment thought, and
from the ailing British Constitution.
They socked away the best ideas for a
democratic experiment.
John Adams realized the delicacy
of the republican polity and the
difficulty in sustaining it. The problem
as he saw it was "... a Purification
from our Vices, and an Augmentation
of our Virtues or they will be no
Blessing." Is there no rest from FAT?
"Empires," declared one workhorse
of the constitutional era, "carry in
them their own bane, and proceed, in
fatal round, from virtuous industry
and velour, to wealth and conquest,
next to luxury, then to foul
corruption and bloated morals; and,
last to sloth, anarchy, slavery, and
political death."
"Bloated" and "sloth" ... did you
see that! What he really meant was fat.
Countries don't work with FAT
people!
Quality of Functions
How do countries work? Walter
Lippmann argues that the American
democracy sustains a duality of
functions, those of governing and
representing. We, the lackeys, rise to
glory only on election day by choosing

Mike Phillips

men for office who in turn represent
the public good. They are, according
to Lippmann, no simple alembics
distilling the people's wishes, but
enlightened men, governing as they see
fit, promoting the common good.
With the mountebanks we've placed
in office we've only complicated our
obligations because now we've got to
watch them as if they were about to
boil over. It's much simpler to have
honest kids, but I'm getting ahead of
myself. .. . Put men in office, says
Lippmann, to run the affairs. Theirs is
the governing function â€” let them do
it independently of the flack from
below.
What can the people do? "They can
elect the government," says Walt. "Or
they can remove it. They can approve
or disapprove its performance. But
they cannot administer the
government. They cannot themselves
perform. They cannot normally
initiate and propose the necessary
legislation. A mass cannot govern."

Quality of Functions
How do countries work? Walter
Lippmann argues that the American
democracy sustains a duality of
functions, those of governing and
representing. We, the lackeys, rise to
glory only on election day by choosing

Mike Phillips

men for office who in turn represent
the public good. They are, according
to Lippmann, no simple alembics
distilling the people's wishes, but
enlightened men, governing as they see
fit, promoting the common good.
With the mountebanks we've placed
in office we've only complicated our
obligations because now we've got to
watch them as if they were about to
boil over. It's much simpler to have
honest kids, but I'm getting ahead of
myself. .. . Put men in office, says
Lippmann, to run the affairs. Theirs is
the governing function â€” let them do
it independently of the flack from
below.
What can the people do? "They can
elect the government," says Walt. "Or
they can remove it. They can approve
or disapprove its performance. But
they cannot administer the
government. They cannot themselves
perform. They cannot normally
initiate and propose the necessary
legislation. A mass cannot govern."
Can they impeach, Walt? I take that
back ... I guess that's not the point.
Health, Honesty, Discipline
What does good government
presuppose? There's only one
possibility in a democracy: Healthy
men, honest men, lean men. Right at
the center of the platter there has to
be a man, and I guess a lonely man,
above mundane concerns. He must at
the very least be intelligent, informed,
disciplined, bold, and I think even in
some cases, a smidgeon calloused,
because he must answer to his own
inward muttering at times when
popularity is against him.
He must catch hold of divine hints
and find clues intended for him alone.
He must be a man of duty without
hopes of personal gain nor of glory.
Above all he must have a sense of
history and eye the time beyond his
death in order to sense the magnitude
of his calling and the temporality of
wealth and luxury. He must be a man
of selflessness to better serve the
people. If you can wait 40 years more,
vote for my son. Or the boy next
door.
But in the meantime there's much
that we can do. We can take only what
we can comfortably eat. Our kids will
pick up the habit. We will save on food
bills. As a result our government in the
not so distant future will be trimmer
and stronger because we will start with
lean and honest assumptions.
We'll start with our children.
(Mike Phillips is a graduate student in
communications.)
Stanford students with children . . .
listen.
To change the government, to
re-introduce into the American system
the concepts of integrity and
legislation for the good of the people,
I hereby propose we carefully guide
the eating habits of our children so
that when they're about 40 years old
(and for the first time seriously
considered as presidential aspirants)
they won't be GLUTTONS! They will
be worthy of governing a country.
They will have known moderation.
Let me explain my vision of
table-train politics. Implicit in the
democratic credo is the assumption
that preserving liberty rests on the
ability of the people to maintain
effective checks on the wielders of
power. What this implies is the
importance of vigilance and moral
stamina of commoners like you and
me in watchdogging our government
officials.

Horro-s of Haldeman! What a bleak
prospect. I don't have time every day
to think through the slinky sophistry
of Nixon. Nor do I have the money to
keep up a steady chain of letters to my
Congressmen to keep them informed.
What I prefer to do is raise the boy
I'll someday have on a little meat, a
little potatoes. I'll want him well, lean
and lithe so he will be content with
modest amounts on his plate, so he
will have known moderation, and
disdain, yes disdain overeating.
My son, who will be president in 40
years, will think fat is the most
heinous mark of a politician and jog to
the White House each morning to rid
himself of dollops around the midriff
instead of summoning the limousine to
work. I only hope I live long enough
to see good government.
You may think this is all
balderdash, but I assure you, some
very fine chefs have worked through
the idea of table-train politics.

They all see at the core of
democracy men working for the public
good, placing country above
self-interest and seeking virtue to make
the system run. Lycurgus had sought
to avoid evil in ancient Sparta by
eliminating wealth itself. Where wealth
flourishes, he thought, luxury is sure
to follow, and after luxury . . . fat. He
was wrong in assuming he could
achieve liberty by squelching the rights
of men wishing to own property
because in doing so he undermined the
very basis of freedom itself. Scotch
Lycurgus.
Don't forget Rome. Governors
prostated themselves beside pools and
chomped lazily on grapes while less
fortunate men toiled madly about
them. Roman politicians rose from
their fat bumpies only in time to hear
the very last dinner bell. . . .
The moral torpitude that brought
liberty in Denmark to its knees in the
1600s, as Molesworth saw it, was the
sloth of corrupt nobles more
interested in using their privileges for
self-indulgence than for service to the
state. Wealth worked an evil effect in
crushing a nation. Brrrrrrr, that's
frightening.
A Working Republic
Our founding tathers were aware of
the necessities for a working republic.
They borrowed ideas from antiquity,
from Enlightenment thought, and
from the ailing British Constitution.
They socked away the best ideas for a
democratic experiment.
John Adams realized the delicacy
of the republican polity and the
difficulty in sustaining it. The problem
as he saw it was "... a Purification
from our Vices, and an Augmentation
of our Virtues or they will be no
Blessing." Is there no rest from FAT?
"Empires," declared one workhorse
of the constitutional era, "carry in
them their own bane, and proceed, in
fatal round, from virtuous industry
and velour, to wealth and conquest,
next to luxury, then to foul
corruption and bloated morals; and,
last to sloth, anarchy, slavery, and
political death."

prostated themselves beside pools and
chomped lazily on grapes while less
fortunate men toiled madly about
them. Roman politicians rose from
their fat bumpies only in time to hear
the very last dinner bell. . . .
The moral torpitude that brought
liberty in Denmark to its knees in the
1600s, as Molesworth saw it, was the
sloth of corrupt nobles more
interested in using their privileges for
self-indulgence than for service to the
state. Wealth worked an evil effect in
crushing a nation. Brrrrrrr, that's
frightening.
A Working Republic
Our founding tathers were aware of
the necessities for a working republic.
They borrowed ideas from antiquity,
from Enlightenment thought, and
from the ailing British Constitution.
They socked away the best ideas for a
democratic experiment.
John Adams realized the delicacy
of the republican polity and the
difficulty in sustaining it. The problem
as he saw it was "... a Purification
from our Vices, and an Augmentation
of our Virtues or they will be no
Blessing." Is there no rest from FAT?
"Empires," declared one workhorse
of the constitutional era, "carry in
them their own bane, and proceed, in
fatal round, from virtuous industry
and velour, to wealth and conquest,
next to luxury, then to foul
corruption and bloated morals; and,
last to sloth, anarchy, slavery, and
political death."
"Bloated" and "sloth" ... did you
see that! What he really meant was fat.
Countries don't work with FAT
people!
Quality of Functions
How do countries work? Walter
Lippmann argues that the American
democracy sustains a duality of
functions, those of governing and
representing. We, the lackeys, rise to
glory only on election day by choosing

men for office who in turn represent
the public good. They are, according
to Lippmann, no simple alembics
distilling the people's wishes, but
enlightened men, governing as they see
fit, promoting the common good.
With the mountebanks we've placed
in office we've only complicated our
obligations because now we've got to
watch them as if they were about to
boil over. It's much simpler to have
honest kids, but I'm getting ahead of
myself. .. . Put men in office, says
Lippmann, to run the affairs. Theirs is
the governing function â€” let them do
it independently of the flack from
below.
What can the people do? "They can
elect the government," says Walt. "Or
they can remove it. They can approve
or disapprove its performance. But
they cannot administer the
government. They cannot themselves
perform. They cannot normally
initiate and propose the necessary
legislation. A mass cannot govern."
Can they impeach, Walt? I take that
back ... I guess that's not the point.
Health, Honesty, Discipline
What does good government
presuppose? There's only one
possibility in a democracy: Healthy
men, honest men, lean men. Right at
the center of the platter there has to
be a man, and I guess a lonely man,
above mundane concerns. He must at
the very least be intelligent, informed,
disciplined, bold, and I think even in
some cases, a smidgeon calloused,
because he must answer to his own
inward muttering at times when
popularity is against him.
He must catch hold of divine hints
and find clues intended for him alone.
He must be a man of duty without
hopes of personal gain nor of glory.
Above all he must have a sense of
history and eye the time beyond his
death in order to sense the magnitude
of his calling and the temporality of
wealth and luxury. He must be a man
of selflessness to better serve the
people. If you can wait 40 years more,
vote for my son. Or the boy next
door.
But in the meantime there's much
that we can do. We can take only what
we can comfortably eat. Our kids will
pick up the habit. We will save on food
bills. As a result our government in the
not so distant future will be trimmer
and stronger because we will start with
lean and honest assumptions.
We'll start with our children.
