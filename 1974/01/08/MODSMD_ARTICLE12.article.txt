# Buetens To Give Solo Lute Recital
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
Stanley Buetens, who is probably America's finest lutenist, will
give a recital of solo lute pieces and lute "ayres" from the Elizabethan
era in Dinkelspiel Auditorium tonight at 8 p.m.
Buetens taught lute and classical guitar at Stanford and San Jose
State for seven years before accepting his present position as lutenist
in residence at UCLA. He is internationally known as the author of
the definitive "Method for the Renaissance Lute," which he published
in 1969.
In 1966, Buetens helped found the Lute Society of America and,
two years later, its scholarly journal, to which he has contributed
many articles on the lute's history and practice.
Record, Concert Experience
In addition to his teaching and writing, he has recorded extensively
(on Nonesuch and other labels) and concertized solo and with
orchestras. Last October he made a concert tour of New England
which culminated in an acclaimed recital in New York's Town Hall.
The music on Buetens' recital program was composed by lutenists
in the golden age of English lute music, from about 1590 to 1620.
This was a time when there was a lute in every aristocratic and
middle-class household, and learning to play the lute was an essential
part of a good upbringing.
This was also the golden era of song in England, and songs (called
"ayres") accompanied by the lute were composed in large numbers.
Ayres and solo pieces by Thomas Morley, John Dowland, Thomas
Ford, Anthony Holborne, the übiquitous Anonymous, and others
were widely played and sung, and many of them appeared in
Shakespeare's plays.
Most Famous Composer
The greatest lutenist of them all, and one of the finest song writers
of all time, was John Dowland. Dowland was not of a sanguine
temperament — his motto was "Semper Dowland, Semper Dolens"
(always doleful) — but he consoled himself by composing some of the
most miserably beautiful songs in the repertoire.
It is assumed that Dowland sang these ayres and played the
intricate accompaniments himself. This difficult feat will be
duplicated this evening by Mr. Buetens, whose dark tenor voice is
unusually well suited to this music.

The recital is sponsored by the Department of Music. General
admission is $2, or $1 for students.

STANLEY BUETENS
Stanley Buetens, who is probably America's finest lutenist, will
give a recital of solo lute pieces and lute "ayres" from the Elizabethan
era in Dinkelspiel Auditorium tonight at 8 p.m.
Buetens taught lute and classical guitar at Stanford and San Jose
State for seven years before accepting his present position as lutenist
in residence at UCLA. He is internationally known as the author of
the definitive "Method for the Renaissance Lute," which he published
in 1969.
In 1966, Buetens helped found the Lute Society of America and,
two years later, its scholarly journal, to which he has contributed
many articles on the lute's history and practice.
Record, Concert Experience
In addition to his teaching and writing, he has recorded extensively
(on Nonesuch and other labels) and concertized solo and with
orchestras. Last October he made a concert tour of New England
which culminated in an acclaimed recital in New York's Town Hall.
The music on Buetens' recital program was composed by lutenists
in the golden age of English lute music, from about 1590 to 1620.
This was a time when there was a lute in every aristocratic and
middle-class household, and learning to play the lute was an essential
part of a good upbringing.
This was also the golden era of song in England, and songs (called
"ayres") accompanied by the lute were composed in large numbers.
Ayres and solo pieces by Thomas Morley, John Dowland, Thomas
Ford, Anthony Holborne, the übiquitous Anonymous, and others
were widely played and sung, and many of them appeared in
Shakespeare's plays.
Most Famous Composer
The greatest lutenist of them all, and one of the finest song writers
of all time, was John Dowland. Dowland was not of a sanguine
temperament — his motto was "Semper Dowland, Semper Dolens"
(always doleful) — but he consoled himself by composing some of the
most miserably beautiful songs in the repertoire.
It is assumed that Dowland sang these ayres and played the
intricate accompaniments himself. This difficult feat will be
duplicated this evening by Mr. Buetens, whose dark tenor voice is
unusually well suited to this music.

The recital is sponsored by the Department of Music. General
admission is $2, or $1 for students.
