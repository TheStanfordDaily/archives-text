# In The Color And The Noise
## Allman Brothers, Friends In New Year's Jam 
### JAY HARLOW 
Jay Harlow

DALY CITY - The Allman
Brothers Band opened the new
year at the Cow Palace with more
of the same kind of music which
paid off so well for them in 1973,
followed by an extended rock and
roll jam with some well-known
local talent.
Bill Graham's New Year's Eve
extravaganza began early,
something which may be
unprecedented in rock history.
Charlie Daniels and band finished
entertaining the early birds, some
of whom had arrived in the early
afternoon, by 8 p.m., the
scheduled starting time.
The Marshall Tucker Band, the
second-best rock and roll band to
come out of the South in recent
years, was on next. With Tucker
on lead guitar, this band puts out
hard-driving music tempered with
the all-important quality of taste
which is lacking in so many lesser
but successful groups.
The Allman Brothers opened
their pre-midnight set with
"Wasted Words," from their most
recent album Brothers and Sisters.
While they played every tune
from this album before the night
was over, they included many of
their previous works.
One standby, Sonny Boy
Williamson's "One Way Out," will
never be the same without Duane
Allman's slide guitar, but is still
one of the band's best live
numbers. This particular rendition
included a long drum interlude by
Butch Trucks and Jaimoe, who
play like one drummer with four
legs and four feet and a
mile-a-minute mind.
New Sounds
As Brothers and Sisters clearly
shows, the Allman Brothers Band
has taken some new directions
since the loss of Duane two years
ago. Part of this has been the
addition of Chuck Leavell on
pianos. On many of the older
numbers which featured dual
guitar harmonies with Dicky
Betts, Leavell fills in with the
same harmonies. On the newer
songs, however, his piano adds to
the bouncy feeling which has, for
better or for worse, replaced the
older, more swinging sound of the
band. This is especially true of
"Ramblin' Man" and "Jessica,"
two of the album's most popular
tracks.
One of the band's best concert
tunes, "Stormy Monday,"
received an excellent treatment.
Leavell was at his most expressive
level in his slow, bluesy solo,
which gave way to an uptempo
organ lead by Gregg Allman and

one of Betts' better guitar solos.
"Midnight Rider" and "Blue Sky"
followed, then the band closed
the set with a version of "In
Memory of Elizabeth Reed"
which showed the band's mastery
of different types of melody
dynamics, and tempo.
After the New Year's Eve
midnight hoohah, which included
balloons, fireworks, and a couple
of diaper-clad 1974 figures being
rolled up to the stage on a big
structure which spewed white
sytrofoam balls out into the
audience, the Allman Brothers
returned with "Statesboro Blues."
As the set progressed, Betts
retreated to the back of the stage
between the drummers in order to
avoid the foam balls which were
still being thrown around and
onto the stage by the crowd.
Plenty of Solo Time
Betts put out some of his finest
guitar work of the evening on
"Jessica," which is easily the best

song of their newer sound. He
followed with a long, searching
introduction to "Les Brers in A
Minor," which has become
another first-rate closing number.
Every member of the band had
plenty of solo space, finishing
with Betts on guitar. This led
neatly into the opening bass line
to "Whipping Post," their usual
closer. However, Gregg had left
the stage and did not sing this
one.
Instead, the band continued
the instrumental riff, and the
sound of Betts' guitar began to
mingle with that of another guitar
which sounded quite familiar.
Jerry Garcia, the mystery
guitarist, also lurking behind the
drummers, came out into the
open just enough to be seen some
of the time. In addition to Garcia,
Grateful Dead drummer Bill
Kreutzmann had replaced Butch
Trucks. "Whipping Post" gave
way to a boogie bass line, and Boz

Scaggs appeared in Gregg's place
at the organ and sang (although
none too clearly — he had
obviously been partying). With
some good improvisation by
Garcia, Betts, and Leavell, this
jam went on for the better part of
an hour. Boz got a bit out of hand
with his singing and shouting, but
otherwise it was not a bad session.
When the Allman Brothers
returned, they were still missing
Gregg and Butch, but this time
they were without a singer. They
continued with "You Don't Love
Me" from Live at the Fillmore
East and another unindentified
tune. The final number was a new
"Mountain Jam," and while it
never quite got off the ground like
the historic Fillmore East version,
it did feature some sympathetic
playing by two of rock's top
guitarists.
The evening ended (at about 4
a.m.) on a bittefsweet note for
Allman fans. After the band had

left the stage, the PA system
played "Little Martha," the
beautiful acoustic guitar duet
from Eat A Peach which is one of
the finest legacies of Duane
Allman. I'm sure I was not the
only one who wished he could
have been there.

they were without a singer. They
continued with "You Don't Love
Me" from Live at the Fillmore
East and another unindentified
tune. The final number was a new
"Mountain Jam," and while it
never quite got off the ground like
the historic Fillmore East version,
it did feature some sympathetic
playing by two of rock's top
guitarists.
The evening ended (at about 4
a.m.) on a bittefsweet note for
Allman fans. After the band had

left the stage, the PA system
played "Little Martha," the
beautiful acoustic guitar duet
from Eat A Peach which is one of
the finest legacies of Duane
Allman. I'm sure I was not the
only one who wished he could
have been there.

DALY CITY - The Allman
Brothers Band opened the new
year at the Cow Palace with more
of the same kind of music which
paid off so well for them in 1973,
followed by an extended rock and
roll jam with some well-known
local talent.
Bill Graham's New Year's Eve
extravaganza began early,
something which may be
unprecedented in rock history.
Charlie Daniels and band finished
entertaining the early birds, some
of whom had arrived in the early
afternoon, by 8 p.m., the
scheduled starting time.
The Marshall Tucker Band, the
second-best rock and roll band to
come out of the South in recent
years, was on next. With Tucker
on lead guitar, this band puts out
hard-driving music tempered with
the all-important quality of taste
which is lacking in so many lesser
but successful groups.
The Allman Brothers opened
their pre-midnight set with
"Wasted Words," from their most
recent album Brothers and Sisters.
While they played every tune
from this album before the night
was over, they included many of
their previous works.
One standby, Sonny Boy
Williamson's "One Way Out," will
never be the same without Duane
Allman's slide guitar, but is still
one of the band's best live
numbers. This particular rendition
included a long drum interlude by
Butch Trucks and Jaimoe, who
play like one drummer with four
legs and four feet and a
mile-a-minute mind.
New Sounds
As Brothers and Sisters clearly
shows, the Allman Brothers Band
has taken some new directions
since the loss of Duane two years
ago. Part of this has been the
addition of Chuck Leavell on
pianos. On many of the older
numbers which featured dual
guitar harmonies with Dicky
Betts, Leavell fills in with the
same harmonies. On the newer
songs, however, his piano adds to
the bouncy feeling which has, for
better or for worse, replaced the
older, more swinging sound of the
band. This is especially true of
"Ramblin' Man" and "Jessica,"
two of the album's most popular
tracks.
One of the band's best concert
tunes, "Stormy Monday,"
received an excellent treatment.
Leavell was at his most expressive
level in his slow, bluesy solo,
which gave way to an uptempo
organ lead by Gregg Allman and

one of Betts' better guitar solos.
"Midnight Rider" and "Blue Sky"
followed, then the band closed
the set with a version of "In
Memory of Elizabeth Reed"
which showed the band's mastery
of different types of melody
dynamics, and tempo.
After the New Year's Eve
midnight hoohah, which included
balloons, fireworks, and a couple
of diaper-clad 1974 figures being
rolled up to the stage on a big
structure which spewed white
sytrofoam balls out into the
audience, the Allman Brothers
returned with "Statesboro Blues."
As the set progressed, Betts
retreated to the back of the stage
between the drummers in order to
avoid the foam balls which were
still being thrown around and
onto the stage by the crowd.
Plenty of Solo Time
Betts put out some of his finest
guitar work of the evening on
"Jessica," which is easily the best

song of their newer sound. He
followed with a long, searching
introduction to "Les Brers in A
Minor," which has become
another first-rate closing number.
Every member of the band had
plenty of solo space, finishing
with Betts on guitar. This led
neatly into the opening bass line
to "Whipping Post," their usual
closer. However, Gregg had left
the stage and did not sing this
one.
Instead, the band continued
the instrumental riff, and the
sound of Betts' guitar began to
mingle with that of another guitar
which sounded quite familiar.
Jerry Garcia, the mystery
guitarist, also lurking behind the
drummers, came out into the
open just enough to be seen some
of the time. In addition to Garcia,
Grateful Dead drummer Bill
Kreutzmann had replaced Butch
Trucks. "Whipping Post" gave
way to a boogie bass line, and Boz

Scaggs appeared in Gregg's place
at the organ and sang (although
none too clearly — he had
obviously been partying). With
some good improvisation by
Garcia, Betts, and Leavell, this
jam went on for the better part of
an hour. Boz got a bit out of hand
with his singing and shouting, but
otherwise it was not a bad session.
When the Allman Brothers
returned, they were still missing
Gregg and Butch, but this time
they were without a singer. They
continued with "You Don't Love

drummers, came out into the
open just enough to be seen some
of the time. In addition to Garcia,
Grateful Dead drummer Bill
Kreutzmann had replaced Butch
Trucks. "Whipping Post" gave
way to a boogie bass line, and Boz

Scaggs appeared in Gregg's place
at the organ and sang (although
none too clearly — he had
obviously been partying). With
some good improvisation by
Garcia, Betts, and Leavell, this
jam went on for the better part of
an hour. Boz got a bit out of hand
with his singing and shouting, but
otherwise it was not a bad session.
When the Allman Brothers
returned, they were still missing
Gregg and Butch, but this time
they were without a singer. They
continued with "You Don't Love
Me" from Live at the Fillmore
East and another unindentified
tune. The final number was a new
"Mountain Jam," and while it
never quite got off the ground like
the historic Fillmore East version,
it did feature some sympathetic
playing by two of rock's top
guitarists.
The evening ended (at about 4
a.m.) on a bittefsweet note for
Allman fans. After the band had

left the stage, the PA system
played "Little Martha," the
beautiful acoustic guitar duet
from Eat A Peach which is one of
the finest legacies of Duane
Allman. I'm sure I was not the
only one who wished he could
have been there.

DALY CITY - The Allman
Brothers Band opened the new
year at the Cow Palace with more
of the same kind of music which
paid off so well for them in 1973,
followed by an extended rock and
roll jam with some well-known
local talent.
Bill Graham's New Year's Eve
extravaganza began early,
something which may be
unprecedented in rock history.
Charlie Daniels and band finished
entertaining the early birds, some
of whom had arrived in the early
afternoon, by 8 p.m., the
scheduled starting time.
The Marshall Tucker Band, the
second-best rock and roll band to
come out of the South in recent
years, was on next. With Tucker
on lead guitar, this band puts out
hard-driving music tempered with
the all-important quality of taste
which is lacking in so many lesser
but successful groups.
The Allman Brothers opened
their pre-midnight set with
"Wasted Words," from their most
recent album Brothers and Sisters.
While they played every tune
from this album before the night
was over, they included many of
their previous works.
One standby, Sonny Boy
Williamson's "One Way Out," will
never be the same without Duane
Allman's slide guitar, but is still
one of the band's best live
numbers. This particular rendition
included a long drum interlude by
Butch Trucks and Jaimoe, who
play like one drummer with four
legs and four feet and a
mile-a-minute mind.
New Sounds
As Brothers and Sisters clearly
shows, the Allman Brothers Band
has taken some new directions
since the loss of Duane two years
ago. Part of this has been the
addition of Chuck Leavell on
pianos. On many of the older
numbers which featured dual
guitar harmonies with Dicky
Betts, Leavell fills in with the
same harmonies. On the newer
songs, however, his piano adds to
the bouncy feeling which has, for
better or for worse, replaced the
older, more swinging sound of the
band. This is especially true of
"Ramblin' Man" and "Jessica,"
two of the album's most popular
tracks.
One of the band's best concert
tunes, "Stormy Monday,"
received an excellent treatment.
Leavell was at his most expressive
level in his slow, bluesy solo,
which gave way to an uptempo
organ lead by Gregg Allman and

one of Betts' better guitar solos.
"Midnight Rider" and "Blue Sky"
followed, then the band closed
the set with a version of "In
Memory of Elizabeth Reed"
which showed the band's mastery
of different types of melody
dynamics, and tempo.
After the New Year's Eve
midnight hoohah, which included
balloons, fireworks, and a couple
of diaper-clad 1974 figures being
rolled up to the stage on a big
structure which spewed white
sytrofoam balls out into the
audience, the Allman Brothers
returned with "Statesboro Blues."
As the set progressed, Betts
retreated to the back of the stage
between the drummers in order to
avoid the foam balls which were
still being thrown around and
onto the stage by the crowd.
Plenty of Solo Time
Betts put out some of his finest
guitar work of the evening on
"Jessica," which is easily the best

song of their newer sound. He
followed with a long, searching
introduction to "Les Brers in A
Minor," which has become
another first-rate closing number.
Every member of the band had
plenty of solo space, finishing
with Betts on guitar. This led
neatly into the opening bass line
to "Whipping Post," their usual
closer. However, Gregg had left
the stage and did not sing this
one.
Instead, the band continued
the instrumental riff, and the
sound of Betts' guitar began to
mingle with that of another guitar
which sounded quite familiar.
Jerry Garcia, the mystery
guitarist, also lurking behind the
drummers, came out into the
open just enough to be seen some

Grateful Dead drummer Bill
Kreutzmann had replaced Butch
Trucks. "Whipping Post" gave
