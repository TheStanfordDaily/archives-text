Watergate Burglars Freed
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Parole Board
yesterday ordered three of the five convicted
Watergate burglars released on parole effective
March 7.
The board freed Eugenio R. Martinea, Frank A.
Sturgis, and Virgilio R. Gonzalez who have served
more than a year in prison and now are confined at
a federal prison camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.
A Justice Department spokesman said the three
must observe customary parole conditions,
including reporting monthly to probation officers.
They will remain on parole until the end of their
sentences. For Martinez, that will be on Jan. 29,
1976 and for the other two, it will be Jan. 2, 1976.
The three were sentenced last November to one
to four years in prison after pleading guilty to
burglary, wiretapping and conspiracy charges.
They had remained in jail more than 11 months
before formal sentencing.
Court To Rule On Indigents
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide whether indigent defendants are
entitled to a free lawyer when they appeal state
convictions to the highest state and federal courts.
The justices agreed to review a decision by the
U.S. Circuit Court at Richmond, Va., which called
on the states to provide such counsel.
North Carolina appealed a decision requiring that
lawyers be furnished to the indigent defendants for
their appeals. Atty. Gen. Robert Morgan asked the
justices to reverse the appeals court.
The circuit judges had declared that as long as
the state "allows other convicted felons to seek
access to the higher court with help of retained
counsel, there is a marked absence of fairness in
denying an indigent the assistance of counsel as he
seeks access to the same court."
The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court
has upheld the indigent's right to counsel for initial
appeals but has reserved judgment on continuing
challenges.
"'What is requisite today may not have been
constitutionally requisite 10 years ago or even a few
years ago. As our legal resources grow, there is a
correlative growth in our ability to implement basic
notions of fairness," wrote Judge Clement F.
Haynsworth, chief judge of the circuit court.
Cambodia Battles Insurgents
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — More than 3000
government reinforcements backed by armored
vehicles sped to Phnom Penh's northwest defense

lines yesterday to counter a big rebel force slashing
toward the capital, field reports said.
National police sources said the insurgent thrust,
north of Pochentong Airport and five to seven miles
northwest of the city itself, was a major effort to
pierce the capital's defense perimeter. But there was
no immediate sign it was an overall assault on the
city.
Field reports said insurgent attackers abducted
an estimated 4000 villagers but that many civilians
remained in the battle zone. The rebels were
reported holding civilian captives near Tang Krasang
pagoda five miles from downtown Phnom Penh.
Ulster Party Chief Steps Down
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Brian Faulkner
quit yesterday as leader of Northern Ireland's
once-dominant Unionist party, vowing to fight on
for his power-sharing policies in the government.
He kept his job as chief executive of the
province's seven-day-old administration. But his loss
of control of the Unionist organization was a clear
setback to Britain's plan for peace between
Protestants and Roman Catholics.
The Unionists ran the province almost alone for
50 years, leaving little room for Catholic
participation. The loss of his Unionist base could
undermine Faulkner's efforts to carry out the
British plan to have Catholics and Protestants run
the new administration together.
His resignation was forced by a decisive vote
against him last week in the Ulster Unionist Council,
the party's governing body. By 457 votes to 374,
the council in effect condemned power sharing with
the Catholic minority.
Specifically, it rejected the all-Ireland council
intended by Britain to promote cooperation
between Northern Ireland, which has a 2-1
Protestant majority, and the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish republic.
Wounded Knee Trial Begins
ST. PAUL, Minn. — Two Indian leaders face trial
today on charges stemming from the 71-day
takeover of Wounded Knee.
U.S. District Judge Fred J. Nichol will begin
questioning about 35 prospective jurors for the trial
of Dennis Banks and Russell Means.
Nichol, who had granted a change of venue from
South Dakota to St. Paul, said yesterday the trial
could last three to four months.
The trial is the first arising from the Feb. 27,
1973 takeover of the South Dakota hamlet by some
250 persons.
Banks, 41, of Minneapolis, and Means, 34, of
Porcupine, S.D., are charged in a 10-count
conspiracy indictment. Four other American Indian
Movement AIM leaders will go on trial later. All face
a maximum penalty of up to 80 years in prison and
$80,000 in fines.
The indictments were brought by a federal grand
jury in Sioux Falls and range' from burglary and
larceny to assault on a federal officer. The grand
jury has indicted about 130 other persons in the
takeover.
Ervin Favors Tape Compromise
MORGANTON, N.C. — Sen. Sam J. Ervin,
D.-N.C., chairman of the Senate Watergate

committee, said yesterday he would welcome a
compromise on subpoenaed White House material,
but would want any agreement in writing.
"We've been anxious to resolve this material all
the time," he said. The agreement should be written
"so there could be no misunderstanding," he said.
Ervin's comments were made after Vice President
Gerald R. Ford hinted on Sunday at the possibility
of a compromise should the committee trim its
request for 500 White House tapes and documents.
The vice president said the subpoenas were too
broad and the committee should refine its demands
"down to things that are relevent to the
committee's responsibilities."
Ervin, who said there had been no contact with
the White House regarding a possible compromise,
said he would be willing to recommend that the
committee, "make reasonable concessions." He did
not elaborate.
Irish Guerillas Prepare Battle
LONDON — Irish guerrillas claimed yesterday
they have planes and are training pilots in
preparation for "much more spectacular"
commando strikes in Britain.
Security tightened at provincial airports across
the country and Canadian airports also went on
special alert. British authorities said their show of
force in London has apparently cut down on
guerrilla explosives smuggling.
The hardline Provisional wing of the Irish
Republican Army said in Dublin that nine guerrilla
pilots were being trained in Ireland and nine more in
Libya, bankrolled by President Moammar Khadafy.
A Provisional source claimed two small planes,
broken down and hidden in packing crates, have
already been smuggled into Dublin.
Japanese Banks Devalue Yen
TOKYO — The Japanese economy, already
buffeted by the Arab oil squeeze, got another shock
yesterday: a devaluation of the yen by 6.7 percent
against the dollar.
Although the development means lower prices
and better sales prospects for Japanese goods
overseas businessmen were unenthusiastic.
They were more concerned about the other
effect of the devaluation — higher prices for foreign
raw materials.
The drop in the value of the yen sent the value of
the dollar up in Europe, dealers in European
financial centers reported. They added that a
weakening of the yen might also mean a weakening
of European currencies.
The bank stopped intervening yesterday and
supply and demand forces quickly dropped the yen
— floating since February — to 299.50 to the dollar.
There was no formal announcement of a
devaluation, but officials at the Bank of Japan and
the Finance Ministry said a minimum rate of 300
yen to the dollar would be maintained.

Court To Rule On Indigents
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide whether indigent defendants are
entitled to a free lawyer when they appeal state
convictions to the highest state and federal courts.
The justices agreed to review a decision by the
U.S. Circuit Court at Richmond, Va., which called
on the states to provide such counsel.
North Carolina appealed a decision requiring that
lawyers be furnished to the indigent defendants for
their appeals. Atty. Gen. Robert Morgan asked the
justices to reverse the appeals court.
The circuit judges had declared that as long as
the state "allows other convicted felons to seek
access to the higher court with help of retained
counsel, there is a marked absence of fairness in
denying an indigent the assistance of counsel as he
seeks access to the same court."
The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court
has upheld the indigent's right to counsel for initial
appeals but has reserved judgment on continuing
challenges.
"'What is requisite today may not have been
constitutionally requisite 10 years ago or even a few
years ago. As our legal resources grow, there is a
correlative growth in our ability to implement basic
notions of fairness," wrote Judge Clement F.
Haynsworth, chief judge of the circuit court.
Cambodia Battles Insurgents
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — More than 3000
government reinforcements backed by armored
vehicles sped to Phnom Penh's northwest defense

lines yesterday to counter a big rebel force slashing
toward the capital, field reports said.
National police sources said the insurgent thrust,
north of Pochentong Airport and five to seven miles
northwest of the city itself, was a major effort to
pierce the capital's defense perimeter. But there was
no immediate sign it was an overall assault on the
city.
Field reports said insurgent attackers abducted
an estimated 4000 villagers but that many civilians
remained in the battle zone. The rebels were
reported holding civilian captives near Tang Krasang
pagoda five miles from downtown Phnom Penh.
Ulster Party Chief Steps Down
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Brian Faulkner
quit yesterday as leader of Northern Ireland's
once-dominant Unionist party, vowing to fight on
for his power-sharing policies in the government.
He kept his job as chief executive of the
province's seven-day-old administration. But his loss
of control of the Unionist organization was a clear
setback to Britain's plan for peace between
Protestants and Roman Catholics.
The Unionists ran the province almost alone for
50 years, leaving little room for Catholic
participation. The loss of his Unionist base could
undermine Faulkner's efforts to carry out the
British plan to have Catholics and Protestants run
the new administration together.
His resignation was forced by a decisive vote
against him last week in the Ulster Unionist Council,
the party's governing body. By 457 votes to 374,
the council in effect condemned power sharing with
the Catholic minority.
Specifically, it rejected the all-Ireland council
intended by Britain to promote cooperation
between Northern Ireland, which has a 2-1
Protestant majority, and the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish republic.
Wounded Knee Trial Begins
ST. PAUL, Minn. — Two Indian leaders face trial
today on charges stemming from the 71-day
takeover of Wounded Knee.
U.S. District Judge Fred J. Nichol will begin
questioning about 35 prospective jurors for the trial
of Dennis Banks and Russell Means.
Nichol, who had granted a change of venue from
South Dakota to St. Paul, said yesterday the trial
could last three to four months.
The trial is the first arising from the Feb. 27,
1973 takeover of the South Dakota hamlet by some
250 persons.
Banks, 41, of Minneapolis, and Means, 34, of
Porcupine, S.D., are charged in a 10-count
conspiracy indictment. Four other American Indian
Movement AIM leaders will go on trial later. All face
a maximum penalty of up to 80 years in prison and
$80,000 in fines.
The indictments were brought by a federal grand
jury in Sioux Falls and range' from burglary and
larceny to assault on a federal officer. The grand
jury has indicted about 130 other persons in the
takeover.
Ervin Favors Tape Compromise
MORGANTON, N.C. — Sen. Sam J. Ervin,
D.-N.C., chairman of the Senate Watergate

committee, said yesterday he would welcome a
compromise on subpoenaed White House material,
but would want any agreement in writing.
"We've been anxious to resolve this material all
the time," he said. The agreement should be written
"so there could be no misunderstanding," he said.
Ervin's comments were made after Vice President
Gerald R. Ford hinted on Sunday at the possibility
of a compromise should the committee trim its
request for 500 White House tapes and documents.
The vice president said the subpoenas were too
broad and the committee should refine its demands
"down to things that are relevent to the
committee's responsibilities."
Ervin, who said there had been no contact with
the White House regarding a possible compromise,
said he would be willing to recommend that the
committee, "make reasonable concessions." He did
not elaborate.
Irish Guerillas Prepare Battle
LONDON — Irish guerrillas claimed yesterday
they have planes and are training pilots in
preparation for "much more spectacular"
commando strikes in Britain.
Security tightened at provincial airports across
the country and Canadian airports also went on
special alert. British authorities said their show of
force in London has apparently cut down on
guerrilla explosives smuggling.
The hardline Provisional wing of the Irish
Republican Army said in Dublin that nine guerrilla
pilots were being trained in Ireland and nine more in
Libya, bankrolled by President Moammar Khadafy.
A Provisional source claimed two small planes,
broken down and hidden in packing crates, have
already been smuggled into Dublin.
Japanese Banks Devalue Yen
TOKYO — The Japanese economy, already
buffeted by the Arab oil squeeze, got another shock
yesterday: a devaluation of the yen by 6.7 percent
against the dollar.
Although the development means lower prices
and better sales prospects for Japanese goods
overseas businessmen were unenthusiastic.
They were more concerned about the other
effect of the devaluation — higher prices for foreign
raw materials.
The drop in the value of the yen sent the value of
the dollar up in Europe, dealers in European
financial centers reported. They added that a
weakening of the yen might also mean a weakening
of European currencies.
The bank stopped intervening yesterday and
supply and demand forces quickly dropped the yen
— floating since February — to 299.50 to the dollar.
There was no formal announcement of a
devaluation, but officials at the Bank of Japan and
the Finance Ministry said a minimum rate of 300
yen to the dollar would be maintained.

Watergate Burglars Freed
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Parole Board
yesterday ordered three of the five convicted
Watergate burglars released on parole effective
March 7.
The board freed Eugenio R. Martinea, Frank A.
Sturgis, and Virgilio R. Gonzalez who have served
more than a year in prison and now are confined at
a federal prison camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.
A Justice Department spokesman said the three
must observe customary parole conditions,
including reporting monthly to probation officers.
They will remain on parole until the end of their
sentences. For Martinez, that will be on Jan. 29,
1976 and for the other two, it will be Jan. 2, 1976.
The three were sentenced last November to one
to four years in prison after pleading guilty to
burglary, wiretapping and conspiracy charges.

Cambodia Battles Insurgents
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — More than 3000
government reinforcements backed by armored
vehicles sped to Phnom Penh's northwest defense

lines yesterday to counter a big rebel force slashing
toward the capital, field reports said.
National police sources said the insurgent thrust,
north of Pochentong Airport and five to seven miles
northwest of the city itself, was a major effort to
pierce the capital's defense perimeter. But there was
no immediate sign it was an overall assault on the
city.
Field reports said insurgent attackers abducted
an estimated 4000 villagers but that many civilians
remained in the battle zone. The rebels were
reported holding civilian captives near Tang Krasang
pagoda five miles from downtown Phnom Penh.
Ulster Party Chief Steps Down
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Brian Faulkner
quit yesterday as leader of Northern Ireland's
once-dominant Unionist party, vowing to fight on
for his power-sharing policies in the government.
He kept his job as chief executive of the
province's seven-day-old administration. But his loss
of control of the Unionist organization was a clear
setback to Britain's plan for peace between
Protestants and Roman Catholics.
The Unionists ran the province almost alone for
50 years, leaving little room for Catholic
participation. The loss of his Unionist base could
undermine Faulkner's efforts to carry out the
British plan to have Catholics and Protestants run
the new administration together.
His resignation was forced by a decisive vote
against him last week in the Ulster Unionist Council,
the party's governing body. By 457 votes to 374,
the council in effect condemned power sharing with
the Catholic minority.
Specifically, it rejected the all-Ireland council
intended by Britain to promote cooperation
between Northern Ireland, which has a 2-1
Protestant majority, and the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish republic.
Wounded Knee Trial Begins
ST. PAUL, Minn. — Two Indian leaders face trial
today on charges stemming from the 71-day
takeover of Wounded Knee.
U.S. District Judge Fred J. Nichol will begin
questioning about 35 prospective jurors for the trial
of Dennis Banks and Russell Means.
Nichol, who had granted a change of venue from
South Dakota to St. Paul, said yesterday the trial
could last three to four months.
The trial is the first arising from the Feb. 27,
1973 takeover of the South Dakota hamlet by some
250 persons.
Banks, 41, of Minneapolis, and Means, 34, of
Porcupine, S.D., are charged in a 10-count
conspiracy indictment. Four other American Indian
Movement AIM leaders will go on trial later. All face
a maximum penalty of up to 80 years in prison and
$80,000 in fines.
The indictments were brought by a federal grand
jury in Sioux Falls and range' from burglary and
larceny to assault on a federal officer. The grand
jury has indicted about 130 other persons in the
takeover.
Ervin Favors Tape Compromise
MORGANTON, N.C. — Sen. Sam J. Ervin,
D.-N.C., chairman of the Senate Watergate

committee, said yesterday he would welcome a
compromise on subpoenaed White House material,
but would want any agreement in writing.
"We've been anxious to resolve this material all
the time," he said. The agreement should be written
"so there could be no misunderstanding," he said.
Ervin's comments were made after Vice President
Gerald R. Ford hinted on Sunday at the possibility
of a compromise should the committee trim its
request for 500 White House tapes and documents.
The vice president said the subpoenas were too
broad and the committee should refine its demands
"down to things that are relevent to the
committee's responsibilities."
Ervin, who said there had been no contact with
the White House regarding a possible compromise,
said he would be willing to recommend that the
committee, "make reasonable concessions." He did
not elaborate.
Irish Guerillas Prepare Battle
LONDON — Irish guerrillas claimed yesterday
they have planes and are training pilots in
preparation for "much more spectacular"
commando strikes in Britain.
Security tightened at provincial airports across
the country and Canadian airports also went on
special alert. British authorities said their show of
force in London has apparently cut down on
guerrilla explosives smuggling.
The hardline Provisional wing of the Irish
Republican Army said in Dublin that nine guerrilla
pilots were being trained in Ireland and nine more in
Libya, bankrolled by President Moammar Khadafy.
A Provisional source claimed two small planes,
broken down and hidden in packing crates, have
already been smuggled into Dublin.
Japanese Banks Devalue Yen
TOKYO — The Japanese economy, already
buffeted by the Arab oil squeeze, got another shock
yesterday: a devaluation of the yen by 6.7 percent
against the dollar.
Although the development means lower prices
and better sales prospects for Japanese goods
overseas businessmen were unenthusiastic.
They were more concerned about the other
effect of the devaluation — higher prices for foreign
raw materials.
The drop in the value of the yen sent the value of
the dollar up in Europe, dealers in European
financial centers reported. They added that a
weakening of the yen might also mean a weakening
of European currencies.
The bank stopped intervening yesterday and
supply and demand forces quickly dropped the yen
— floating since February — to 299.50 to the dollar.
There was no formal announcement of a
devaluation, but officials at the Bank of Japan and
the Finance Ministry said a minimum rate of 300
yen to the dollar would be maintained.

Watergate Burglars Freed
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Parole Board
yesterday ordered three of the five convicted
Watergate burglars released on parole effective
March 7.
The board freed Eugenio R. Martinea, Frank A.
Sturgis, and Virgilio R. Gonzalez who have served
more than a year in prison and now are confined at
a federal prison camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.
A Justice Department spokesman said the three
must observe customary parole conditions,
including reporting monthly to probation officers.
They will remain on parole until the end of their
sentences. For Martinez, that will be on Jan. 29,
1976 and for the other two, it will be Jan. 2, 1976.
The three were sentenced last November to one
to four years in prison after pleading guilty to
burglary, wiretapping and conspiracy charges.
They had remained in jail more than 11 months
before formal sentencing.
Court To Rule On Indigents
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide whether indigent defendants are
entitled to a free lawyer when they appeal state
convictions to the highest state and federal courts.
The justices agreed to review a decision by the
U.S. Circuit Court at Richmond, Va., which called
on the states to provide such counsel.
North Carolina appealed a decision requiring that
lawyers be furnished to the indigent defendants for
their appeals. Atty. Gen. Robert Morgan asked the
justices to reverse the appeals court.
The circuit judges had declared that as long as
the state "allows other convicted felons to seek
access to the higher court with help of retained
counsel, there is a marked absence of fairness in
denying an indigent the assistance of counsel as he
seeks access to the same court."

pierce the capital's defense perimeter. But there was
no immediate sign it was an overall assault on the
city.
Field reports said insurgent attackers abducted
an estimated 4000 villagers but that many civilians
remained in the battle zone. The rebels were
reported holding civilian captives near Tang Krasang
pagoda five miles from downtown Phnom Penh.
Ulster Party Chief Steps Down
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Brian Faulkner
quit yesterday as leader of Northern Ireland's
once-dominant Unionist party, vowing to fight on
for his power-sharing policies in the government.
He kept his job as chief executive of the
province's seven-day-old administration. But his loss
of control of the Unionist organization was a clear
setback to Britain's plan for peace between
Protestants and Roman Catholics.
The Unionists ran the province almost alone for
50 years, leaving little room for Catholic
participation. The loss of his Unionist base could
undermine Faulkner's efforts to carry out the
British plan to have Catholics and Protestants run
the new administration together.
His resignation was forced by a decisive vote
against him last week in the Ulster Unionist Council,
the party's governing body. By 457 votes to 374,
the council in effect condemned power sharing with
the Catholic minority.
Specifically, it rejected the all-Ireland council
intended by Britain to promote cooperation
between Northern Ireland, which has a 2-1
Protestant majority, and the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish republic.
Wounded Knee Trial Begins
ST. PAUL, Minn. — Two Indian leaders face trial
today on charges stemming from the 71-day
takeover of Wounded Knee.
U.S. District Judge Fred J. Nichol will begin
questioning about 35 prospective jurors for the trial
of Dennis Banks and Russell Means.
Nichol, who had granted a change of venue from
South Dakota to St. Paul, said yesterday the trial
could last three to four months.
The trial is the first arising from the Feb. 27,
1973 takeover of the South Dakota hamlet by some
250 persons.
Banks, 41, of Minneapolis, and Means, 34, of
Porcupine, S.D., are charged in a 10-count
conspiracy indictment. Four other American Indian
Movement AIM leaders will go on trial later. All face
a maximum penalty of up to 80 years in prison and
$80,000 in fines.
The indictments were brought by a federal grand
jury in Sioux Falls and range' from burglary and
larceny to assault on a federal officer. The grand
jury has indicted about 130 other persons in the
takeover.
Ervin Favors Tape Compromise
MORGANTON, N.C. — Sen. Sam J. Ervin,
D.-N.C., chairman of the Senate Watergate

committee, said yesterday he would welcome a
compromise on subpoenaed White House material,
but would want any agreement in writing.
"We've been anxious to resolve this material all
the time," he said. The agreement should be written
"so there could be no misunderstanding," he said.
Ervin's comments were made after Vice President
Gerald R. Ford hinted on Sunday at the possibility
of a compromise should the committee trim its
request for 500 White House tapes and documents.
The vice president said the subpoenas were too
broad and the committee should refine its demands
"down to things that are relevent to the
committee's responsibilities."
Ervin, who said there had been no contact with
the White House regarding a possible compromise,
said he would be willing to recommend that the
committee, "make reasonable concessions." He did
not elaborate.
Irish Guerillas Prepare Battle
LONDON — Irish guerrillas claimed yesterday
they have planes and are training pilots in
preparation for "much more spectacular"
commando strikes in Britain.
Security tightened at provincial airports across
the country and Canadian airports also went on
special alert. British authorities said their show of
force in London has apparently cut down on
guerrilla explosives smuggling.
The hardline Provisional wing of the Irish
Republican Army said in Dublin that nine guerrilla
pilots were being trained in Ireland and nine more in
Libya, bankrolled by President Moammar Khadafy.
A Provisional source claimed two small planes,
broken down and hidden in packing crates, have
already been smuggled into Dublin.
Japanese Banks Devalue Yen
TOKYO — The Japanese economy, already
buffeted by the Arab oil squeeze, got another shock
yesterday: a devaluation of the yen by 6.7 percent
against the dollar.
Although the development means lower prices
and better sales prospects for Japanese goods
overseas businessmen were unenthusiastic.
They were more concerned about the other
effect of the devaluation — higher prices for foreign
raw materials.
The drop in the value of the yen sent the value of
the dollar up in Europe, dealers in European
financial centers reported. They added that a
weakening of the yen might also mean a weakening
of European currencies.
The bank stopped intervening yesterday and
supply and demand forces quickly dropped the yen
— floating since February — to 299.50 to the dollar.
There was no formal announcement of a
devaluation, but officials at the Bank of Japan and
the Finance Ministry said a minimum rate of 300
yen to the dollar would be maintained.

Watergate Burglars Freed
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Parole Board
yesterday ordered three of the five convicted
Watergate burglars released on parole effective
March 7.
The board freed Eugenio R. Martinea, Frank A.
Sturgis, and Virgilio R. Gonzalez who have served
more than a year in prison and now are confined at
a federal prison camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.
A Justice Department spokesman said the three
must observe customary parole conditions,
including reporting monthly to probation officers.
They will remain on parole until the end of their
sentences. For Martinez, that will be on Jan. 29,
1976 and for the other two, it will be Jan. 2, 1976.
The three were sentenced last November to one
to four years in prison after pleading guilty to
burglary, wiretapping and conspiracy charges.
They had remained in jail more than 11 months
before formal sentencing.
Court To Rule On Indigents
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide whether indigent defendants are
entitled to a free lawyer when they appeal state
convictions to the highest state and federal courts.
The justices agreed to review a decision by the
U.S. Circuit Court at Richmond, Va., which called
on the states to provide such counsel.
North Carolina appealed a decision requiring that
lawyers be furnished to the indigent defendants for
their appeals. Atty. Gen. Robert Morgan asked the
justices to reverse the appeals court.
The circuit judges had declared that as long as
the state "allows other convicted felons to seek
access to the higher court with help of retained
counsel, there is a marked absence of fairness in
denying an indigent the assistance of counsel as he
seeks access to the same court."
The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court
has upheld the indigent's right to counsel for initial
appeals but has reserved judgment on continuing
challenges.
"'What is requisite today may not have been
constitutionally requisite 10 years ago or even a few
years ago. As our legal resources grow, there is a
correlative growth in our ability to implement basic
notions of fairness," wrote Judge Clement F.
Haynsworth, chief judge of the circuit court.
Cambodia Battles Insurgents
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — More than 3000
government reinforcements backed by armored
vehicles sped to Phnom Penh's northwest defense

lines yesterday to counter a big rebel force slashing
toward the capital, field reports said.
National police sources said the insurgent thrust,
north of Pochentong Airport and five to seven miles
northwest of the city itself, was a major effort to
pierce the capital's defense perimeter. But there was
no immediate sign it was an overall assault on the
city.
Field reports said insurgent attackers abducted
