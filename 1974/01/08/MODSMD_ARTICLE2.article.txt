# Artificial Insemination Raises Legal And Ethical Questions
## 
### ROB QUICK Second Of Two Parts 
A number of Stanford medical
students have fathered children they'll
never know.
The thought doesn't seem to bother
those students who have contributed
sperm for artificial insemination
purposes to two Bay Area
gynecologists.
Apparently, the same thought has
not bothered either the women
involved or their husbands.
"I have never seen any problems
with donor insemination," says Dr.
Eugene Finkle, a San Carlos
gynecologist. "If they're really a loving
couple, it doesn't make a hell of a lot
of difference where the sperm comes
from."
But since the sperm does come
from a foreign source, it could create
problems, especially for the infertile
husband. "Emotionally it is the
husband I worry about," says a Palo
Alto gynecologist, who wishes to
remain anonymous. "The woman is
fulfilling her biological function. The
husband must be made to feel that he
is an important part of the procedure.
He is making this possible. It is not
merely a matter between the wife and
the physician."
Husbands Take Part
In an effort to feel more a part of
the process some husbands "squirt the
sperm in the wife's vagina themselves,"
according to Finkle.
This procedure is easily
accomplished, for the insemination
itself involves nothing more than the
injection by syringe of the semen
against the cervix. "It's just like doing
a Pap smear," Finkle explains.
Sometimes Finkle will mix the
donor's sperm with the father's "so
one would never know for sure who
the father really was."
Sperm Deficiency
Both practices boost the husband's
psychological state. Finkle speculates
that a shortage of sperm indicates
something defective about its
fertilizability. This would explain why
attempts to impregnate a woman with
the combination of three or four
sperm specimens from her infertile
husband have been unsuccessful.
Both doctors select a sperm donor
who resembles the husband.
Therefore, the child's physical
characteristics will resemble the
"father's."
Careful donor choice is a sensible
precaution. Screening couples is
equally important. "I, myself, have

never suggested artificial insemination
to a couple," the Palo Alto doctor
points out. He lets them bring it up.
Although 65 percent of his patients
have given birth, and spontaneous
abortions are rare, he stresses the
possibility of disappointment.
The Palo Alto doctor believes that
his attitude as a physician should be
both "permissive and objective." He
will not, for example, accept a patient
"too soon after the husband finds out
about his sterility." He allows "time
for the husband to get over the
shock."
Only after a suitable adjustment
period, if the couple is "mature,
well-adjusted, and well-married," will
he proceed with artificial
insemination. Sometimes, he suggests
that a couple see a psychiatrist if they
have any doubts.
Finkle, on the other hand, says he
"would never say no" to his patients.
"I inform them and give them the
freedom to make the decision. I don't
want to be too objective," he says."I
have faith in my patients."
Legitimacy Questioned
Faith alone, however, does not
insure against potential legal problems.
The most pertinent legal questions
deal with the legitimacy of the child
and problems of inheritance; visitation
rights in the event of divorce or
separation; the possibility that the
mother, doctor, or donor be guilty of
adultery; or that the doctor who signs
the birth certificate might be
commiting a crime.
Since the father is permitted to
accept the child as his own natural
heir, the above considerations present
no real problem, according to the Palo
Alto doctor.
Religious Opposition
Ethical questions
remain. The Orthodox Jewish faith
and Lutheran, Anglican and Catholic
churches are all opposed to artificial
insemination, according to Finkle.
Nevertheless, Finkle asserts,
"Religion doesn't play an important
role in people's consideration. It
would be a rare person who would let
religion get in the way."
The whole question is "ethically
neutral" to Finkle. "It's just a way of
accomplishing an end," he says.
That end is the birth of a child,
who. among all aspects of the artificial
insemination process deserves the most
consideration.
The Palo Alto doctor advises the
parents that the origin of their child

should remain private. "The welfare of
the child and the community is
paramount," he stresses.
Finkle is optimistic: "The seed is
incidental. What makes somebody my
parent is the fact that they care for me
and love me, not because of my genes.
"I see no problems," he continues.
'These people went to a hell of a lot
of trouble to have this child. This child
was really wanted."

and problems of inheritance; visitation
rights in the event of divorce or
separation; the possibility that the
mother, doctor, or donor be guilty of
adultery; or that the doctor who signs
the birth certificate might be
commiting a crime.
Since the father is permitted to
accept the child as his own natural
heir, the above considerations present
no real problem, according to the Palo
Alto doctor.
Religious Opposition
Ethical questions
remain. The Orthodox Jewish faith
and Lutheran, Anglican and Catholic
churches are all opposed to artificial
insemination, according to Finkle.
Nevertheless, Finkle asserts,
"Religion doesn't play an important
role in people's consideration. It
would be a rare person who would let
religion get in the way."
The whole question is "ethically
neutral" to Finkle. "It's just a way of
accomplishing an end," he says.
That end is the birth of a child,
who. among all aspects of the artificial
insemination process deserves the most
consideration.
The Palo Alto doctor advises the
parents that the origin of their child

should remain private. "The welfare of
the child and the community is
paramount," he stresses.
Finkle is optimistic: "The seed is
incidental. What makes somebody my
parent is the fact that they care for me
and love me, not because of my genes.
"I see no problems," he continues.
'These people went to a hell of a lot
of trouble to have this child. This child
was really wanted."
A number of Stanford medical
students have fathered children they'll
never know.
The thought doesn't seem to bother
those students who have contributed
sperm for artificial insemination
purposes to two Bay Area
gynecologists.
Apparently, the same thought has
not bothered either the women
involved or their husbands.
"I have never seen any problems
with donor insemination," says Dr.
Eugene Finkle, a San Carlos
gynecologist. "If they're really a loving
couple, it doesn't make a hell of a lot
of difference where the sperm comes
from."
But since the sperm does come
from a foreign source, it could create
problems, especially for the infertile
husband. "Emotionally it is the
husband I worry about," says a Palo
Alto gynecologist, who wishes to
remain anonymous. "The woman is
fulfilling her biological function. The
husband must be made to feel that he
is an important part of the procedure.
He is making this possible. It is not
merely a matter between the wife and
the physician."
Husbands Take Part
In an effort to feel more a part of
the process some husbands "squirt the
sperm in the wife's vagina themselves,"
according to Finkle.
This procedure is easily
accomplished, for the insemination
itself involves nothing more than the
injection by syringe of the semen
against the cervix. "It's just like doing
a Pap smear," Finkle explains.
Sometimes Finkle will mix the
donor's sperm with the father's "so
one would never know for sure who
the father really was."
Sperm Deficiency
Both practices boost the husband's
psychological state. Finkle speculates
that a shortage of sperm indicates
something defective about its
fertilizability. This would explain why
attempts to impregnate a woman with
the combination of three or four
sperm specimens from her infertile
husband have been unsuccessful.
Both doctors select a sperm donor
who resembles the husband.
Therefore, the child's physical
characteristics will resemble the
"father's."
Careful donor choice is a sensible
precaution. Screening couples is
equally important. "I, myself, have

never suggested artificial insemination
to a couple," the Palo Alto doctor
points out. He lets them bring it up.
Although 65 percent of his patients
have given birth, and spontaneous
abortions are rare, he stresses the
possibility of disappointment.
The Palo Alto doctor believes that
his attitude as a physician should be
both "permissive and objective." He
will not, for example, accept a patient
"too soon after the husband finds out
about his sterility." He allows "time
for the husband to get over the
shock."
Only after a suitable adjustment
period, if the couple is "mature,
well-adjusted, and well-married," will
he proceed with artificial
insemination. Sometimes, he suggests
that a couple see a psychiatrist if they
have any doubts.
Finkle, on the other hand, says he
"would never say no" to his patients.
"I inform them and give them the
freedom to make the decision. I don't
want to be too objective," he says."I
have faith in my patients."

insure against potential legal problems.

husband have been unsuccessful.
Both doctors select a sperm donor
who resembles the husband.
Therefore, the child's physical
characteristics will resemble the
"father's."
Careful donor choice is a sensible
precaution. Screening couples is
equally important. "I, myself, have

never suggested artificial insemination
to a couple," the Palo Alto doctor
points out. He lets them bring it up.
Although 65 percent of his patients
have given birth, and spontaneous
abortions are rare, he stresses the
possibility of disappointment.
The Palo Alto doctor believes that
his attitude as a physician should be
both "permissive and objective." He
will not, for example, accept a patient
"too soon after the husband finds out
about his sterility." He allows "time
for the husband to get over the
shock."
Only after a suitable adjustment
period, if the couple is "mature,
well-adjusted, and well-married," will
he proceed with artificial
insemination. Sometimes, he suggests
that a couple see a psychiatrist if they
have any doubts.
Finkle, on the other hand, says he
"would never say no" to his patients.
"I inform them and give them the
freedom to make the decision. I don't
want to be too objective," he says."I
have faith in my patients."
Legitimacy Questioned
Faith alone, however, does not
insure against potential legal problems.
The most pertinent legal questions
deal with the legitimacy of the child
and problems of inheritance; visitation
rights in the event of divorce or
separation; the possibility that the
mother, doctor, or donor be guilty of
adultery; or that the doctor who signs
the birth certificate might be
commiting a crime.
Since the father is permitted to
accept the child as his own natural
heir, the above considerations present
no real problem, according to the Palo
Alto doctor.
Religious Opposition
Ethical questions
remain. The Orthodox Jewish faith
and Lutheran, Anglican and Catholic
churches are all opposed to artificial
insemination, according to Finkle.
Nevertheless, Finkle asserts,
"Religion doesn't play an important
role in people's consideration. It
would be a rare person who would let
religion get in the way."
The whole question is "ethically
neutral" to Finkle. "It's just a way of
accomplishing an end," he says.
That end is the birth of a child,
who. among all aspects of the artificial
insemination process deserves the most
consideration.
The Palo Alto doctor advises the
parents that the origin of their child

should remain private. "The welfare of
the child and the community is
paramount," he stresses.
Finkle is optimistic: "The seed is
incidental. What makes somebody my
parent is the fact that they care for me
and love me, not because of my genes.
"I see no problems," he continues.
'These people went to a hell of a lot
of trouble to have this child. This child
was really wanted."
A number of Stanford medical
students have fathered children they'll
never know.
The thought doesn't seem to bother
those students who have contributed
sperm for artificial insemination
purposes to two Bay Area
gynecologists.
Apparently, the same thought has
not bothered either the women
involved or their husbands.
"I have never seen any problems
with donor insemination," says Dr.
Eugene Finkle, a San Carlos
gynecologist. "If they're really a loving
couple, it doesn't make a hell of a lot
of difference where the sperm comes
from."
But since the sperm does come
from a foreign source, it could create
problems, especially for the infertile
husband. "Emotionally it is the
husband I worry about," says a Palo
Alto gynecologist, who wishes to
remain anonymous. "The woman is
fulfilling her biological function. The
husband must be made to feel that he
is an important part of the procedure.
He is making this possible. It is not
merely a matter between the wife and
the physician."
Husbands Take Part
In an effort to feel more a part of
the process some husbands "squirt the
sperm in the wife's vagina themselves,"
according to Finkle.
This procedure is easily
accomplished, for the insemination
itself involves nothing more than the
injection by syringe of the semen
against the cervix. "It's just like doing
a Pap smear," Finkle explains.
Sometimes Finkle will mix the
donor's sperm with the father's "so
one would never know for sure who
the father really was."
Sperm Deficiency
Both practices boost the husband's
psychological state. Finkle speculates
that a shortage of sperm indicates
something defective about its
fertilizability. This would explain why
attempts to impregnate a woman with
the combination of three or four
sperm specimens from her infertile
husband have been unsuccessful.
