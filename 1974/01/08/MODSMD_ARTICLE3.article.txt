# Garriott Lauds Skylab Value
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
In his first Bay Area appearance
since returning to earth, Skylab 2
astronaut Owen K. Garriott
maintained that the results of his flight
have "provided us with important
information."
Speaking to a large audience in
Bishop Auditorium on Dec. 6, Garriott
— a Stanford professor on leave for the
past several years — predicted that "we
will be interpreting data for at least
three more years."
During their July 28-Sept. 5 flight,
Garriott and his two partners, Jack
Lousma and Alan Bean, set a record of
1427 hours, nine minutes in space.
The three-man crew conducted
studies of the sun, of man's reactions
to an environment of no gravity and of
earth resources.

Garriott, who headed the solar
study, emphasized that "it is
important that we understand the sun
well, for it provides large sources of
energy."
Observing the sun through a
"coronograph" telescope, the crew
discovered that the "dynamic activity
in the corona is far greater than we
would have predicted six months ago,"
Garriott said.
Even though the sun was at a
period of "solar minimum," the crew
saw "20-30 large helium bubbles
coming out of the sun's atmosphere."
According to Garriott, the Skylab 2
astronauts were the first ever to have
witnessed this solar activity.
The astronauts also studied their
body responses to the no-gravity

environment. They measured changes
in body fluid balance and blood
pressure by climbing into a "lower
body negative pressure device," which
simulates the pressure of gravity.
Garriott, Lousma and Bean
exercised at least one hour per day.
They either pedalled on a
"bicyclogometer," or used
spring-exercise devices.
Every third day, the astronauts
measured blood pressure, heart beat
and CO-2 output while pedalling on
the "bicyclogometer."
Garriott emphasized that while in
space the astronauts considered
"exercise very important in
maintaining a sense of well-being."
After attaching electrodes to their
heads every third night, the astronauts
discovered only an insignificant
increase of 10-15 minutes of sleep in
space.
The astronauts followed a carefully
regulated diet during the flight, and
brought back to earth a frozen 120
mil. sample of each daily waste
product pool for subsequent research.
The astronauts circled the earth 39
times to study potential natural
resources. Through "false color"
photography, the astronauts located
not only areas of crop infestation, but
also the presence of chlorophyll in
certain bodies of water in the U.S. and
off the coast of Peru.
Garriott defended the $2'/2 billion
cost of the program: "I'm impressed
by the amount of work that can be
done within that price range, and by
its potential for the future," he said.
