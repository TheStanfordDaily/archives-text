# KZSU Halts Broadcasts Of Basketball Contests
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN First Of Two Parts 
KZSU has stopped broadcasting
Stanford basketball games while the
station attempts to settle a
controversy with the Athletic
Department regarding violations of an
exclusive contract between the
Department and KSFO, a San
Francisco-based radio station.
The contract, which has been in
existence for a number of years,
forbids the Athletic Department to
grant broadcasting rights for football
and basketball games to any other
radio station in nine Bay Area
counties, including Santa Clara.
By broadcasting the games over
their FM band and by "reaching out
into the local community for
underwriters," KZSU puts the
Department in a position which
violates the contract, according to a
letter sent from Athletic Director

Joseph H. Ruetz to then-station
manager Lloyd Snook.
The Dec. 27, 1973 letter states that
because of this conflict, "a significant
source of regular budget base income
to Stanford has been placed in
jeopardy unless this issue can be
immediately resolved." Reportedly,
KSFO pays Stanford $28,000 for
broadcast rights.
AM Release Only
The issue was formerly raised
during October, 1970 in an exchange
of letters between KSFO Director of
Operations Robert A. Hansen and
then-KZSU station manager David H.
Hosley. Hansen wrote that his station
"will be happy to cooperate in having
your [KZSU's] announcers train on
Stanford games on your AM carrier
current feed to the campus dorms."
However, Hansen continued that
"Any advertising you [KZSU] would
carry, at obviously greatly reduced
rates, would . . . diminish the
desirability of our advertising . . . ."
He asked that KZSU not carry
advertising.
The letter also stated that KSFO
could not grant permission for the
requested FM release because doing so
would potentially diminish the worth
of the broadcasts to potential
advertisers.
Hosley responded that KZSU was
"most disappointed that the Stanford
University radio station cannot
broadcast its own team's games except
to the dormitories." The problem "is
something to be worked out with the
university and not with KSFO," he
added.
According to Snook, now KZSU's
business manager, Hansen and Hosley
met in San Francisco following the

correspondence and agreed that KZSU
could broadcast on FM if the station
didn't solicit advertising for the
presentations.
During the recent football season,
KZSU broadcast the six home games
plus the USC contest from Los
Angeles on AM and FM, with the
expense being underwritten by
companies in the community.
KZSU also broadcast the first three
home basketball games this season and
had planned to continue this past
weekend. But in December the station
requested credentials from Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy to
air the upcoming USC and UCLA
games.
Murphy said that he was concerned
because of limited available space at
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion and that he
was unsure whether the contract
permitted the broadcasts. He called
Don Klein who announces Stanford
basketball and football games for
KSFO and who is familiar with the
contract and has acted as a liaison
between the Athletic Department and
the station, according to Murphy.
Underwriting Questioned
During the conversation Klein
questioned Murphy about the
broadcasts and KZSU's procedure
concerning underwriting. In examining
the contract, Murphy realized the
violations created by the KZSU
broadcasts, which put the Athletic
Department in a precarious position.
Snook said that the pressure from
the Department was the reason KZSU
did not air the Oregon contests.
Negotiations between
representatives of the two radio
stations, the Athletic Department and
the University have begun.
