# Democratic Gubernatorial Hopeful Roth
## Apathy, Bureaucracy Worry Darkhorse 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
William Matson Roth is a very dark
horse.
He knows it. But his position far
down in the pack of Democratic
gubernatorial hopefuls doesn't seem to
bother him.
"Up to this point, name recognition
hasn't concerned me," Roth told the
Daily last week. "It's almost an
advantage, given the political context
we're working in."
Instead, the dogged, self-confident
Roth is deeply worried about
government's basic health. Most
Americans, he said, no longer believe
that government gives a damn about
what happens to them.
'Apathetic As Hell'
As a result, he said, the electorate
this year is "apathetic as hell."
"This is the great danger, more than
anything else. When in a democracy
you just have people throwing up their
hands and not participating, anyone
can get elected. That's what can
happen if there's no excitement in the
race — if there's no feeling that one
person offers something, not just in
terms of issues but in terms of
orientation.
"Someone who comes in from the
outside — such as I — has no chance at
all. Jerry Brown, who gets his father's
name recognition, could just float in.
All kinds of people could just float in.
It's very worrisome."
The concern in Roth's voice, hoarse
from the campaign as much as the
cold, is real. The man is not a
politician by nature; his manner is too
quiet, too dispassionate. It is easy to
see why he fails to rouse crowds to
frenzy, or even excitement.
Roth is a California aristocrat, a
member of an old San Francisco
family. He has something of an

aristocrat's conception of civic health,
the liberal aristocrat's sense of civic
duty.
He is not quite as nonpolitical as he
might suggest. He has held jobs in
government — regent of the University
of California (appointed by Pat Brown
in 1961), trade negotiator under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson —
and he has been a Democratic stalwart
for 20 years. But he has never run for

office before.
Now, he said, he's beginning to
move the campaign into a new, "more
exciting" phase.
"There are some problems here,"
he admitted. "One of them — because
you're talking here about political
theater — is that the major issues we
face do not have much political sex
appeal. ... To me, the critical problem
we face is that the fact that

government is not working now. It's
become so large and complex and
bureaucratic and unresponsive that it
simply doesn't work.
Corporate Interests
"There are several aspects of this.
One is increasing control of the large
corporate interests of the process of
government — this is of critical
importance. The need for public
financing of campaigns."
Roth wants the state government to
take a more active role in analyzing
problems and planning solutions.
"To me, I suppose, the
fundamental objective of state
government — more than anything else
— should be analysis, planning,
forecasting, information. The energy
crisis — this should have been foreseen
several years ago ... The state can
bring together, into a central agency,
all the aspects of the problem."
Wouldn't this merely increase an
already unwieldy state bureaucracy?
"No, not at all," Roth answered.
"The planning dollar, the analysis
dollar, is always the smallest and the
cheapest. .. When Reagan vetoed
$250,000 for planning money for the
Coastal Commission, this is idiocy.
Bureaucratic Excess
"It's cheap money, it involves a few
people, and it's the fundamental
planning that's required. On the other
hand, when the city of San Francisco
hires 20 nurses to check on Medi-Cal
and Medicare payments — instead of
nursing — this is what government
shouldn't be doing, this is a kind of
bureaucratic excess."
Roth said one approach to
reinvigorating state government is just
plain sound management.
"Unfortunately, Gov. Reagan
doesn't know what the hell he's

talking about," he declared, his voice
rising slightly. "He's been a very bad
financial manager. He's been a bad
financial manager because he's
undermined the authority and the
expertise of the Department of
Finance, when he gave the budget to
his agency heads to negotiate among
themselves.
"But also, never having run an
organization, he's not tackling the
bureaucratic problem the only way it
can be tackled, which is to develop
programs with as little bureaucratic
content as possible — not by just
taking existing programs and cutting
back.
As Governor, Roth said he would
work toward "restoring the University
of California to its previous greatness,"
while opposing new tuition hikes and
pushing for increased financial aid to
students; increasing the quality of
education at every level; and
decreasing penalties for victimless
crimes, including use and possession of
marijuana.
