# Looking Back
## Year Of The Hyena 
### 
Andrew Leuchter

Chinese astrologers long ago determined that 1973 would be the year of the
ox. But hindsight is more accurate than even the keenest stargazing, and in
retrospect it is apparent that 1973 was actually the year of the hyena. Only the
insane laughter of this animal can symbolize the tumult of a year in which the
uninfluential became the powerful; a year in which long-ignored, unpopular
causes became the concern of the majority; a year in which the impotent, in a
nouveau riche display of power, could occasionally stick their tongues out at the
world.
The most conspicuous minority of 1973 was the citizenry of Massachusetts.
This single bastion of McGovern solidarity was redeemed last year as the White
House scandals unfolded. The high-watermark of the "Impeach Nixon"
movement was the zenith of Massachusetts' collective pride, when a majority of
American's would have voted for George McGovern if given a second chance.
But virtue was not its own reward to the people of Massachusetts: they took
advantage of this opportunity to vaunt their foresight. "Impeachment Now"
bumper stickers are not nearly so popular on the states autos as the stickers
reading "Don't Blame Me, I'm From Massachusetts."
But a few vociferous voices stand apart from the crowd now crying for
impeachment. These are the long-time Nixon critics, whose prophetic cries for
impeachment years ago have made them the patron saints of the impeachment
movement. The foremost figure in this clan is its senior member — Helen
Gahagan Douglas. She has been a critic of Richard Nixon since their 1946
primary race for the Senate, when Representative Nixon accused her of being
"pink down to her underwear" — a statement which Mrs. Douglas resented not
so much as an intimation about her undergarments, but as a libelous insinuation
alleging her sympathy with the Communist Party. Mrs. Douglas nursed her
criticism in relative obscurity until last year, when her bitter experience with
Richard Nixon's "dirty tricks" made her one of the most influential voices in the
impeachment drive.
Lowenstein Alliance Grows
Another impeachment advocate redeemed by Mr. Nixon's recent troubles is
Allard Lowenstein. Lowenstein's Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) long
stood for the impeachment of President Nixon, but until 1973 neither
Lowenstein nor his ADA had been taken seriously. By the end of the year,
however, the ranks of ADA membership had swelled significantly. And not only
was Lowenstein able to win an impeachment debate on William Buckley's Firing
Line, but he is also considered a serious contender for a Senate seat from New
York.
Richard Nixon was not the only political figure humbled by the events of
1973; indeed, it was typical of the year of the hyena that an international host
of political leaders fell prey to their critics. Britain's Heath, Germany's Brandt,
Israel's Meir and Japan's Tanaka all suffered serious setbacks — Chile's Allende
and Greece's Papadopulos lost control entirely. The only world figure to increase
his clout during 1973 began the year in political obscurity — Saudi Arabia's King
Faisal.
The Arabs blundered to defeat on the battlefield despite the advantages that
surprise and the Russians had given them; Faisal, meanwhile, enjoyed the
diplomatic success of the oil embargo. Use of the embargo as a diplomatic tool,
however, only partially justifies Faisal's actions; the subsequent oil price hikes
and Arab visits to Western nations can only be termed flaunting of power. As
one Washington gadfly said on Sheik Yamani's departure; "He did nothing but
show off his mistletoe bustle."
Domestic Changes
The year of the hyena left its mark on world politics, but the most
encouraging turnabouts of 1973 were purely domestic. A lot of good news came
out of the South, where the pride of Texas' citizens increased dramatically.
Though they still bear the brunt of scores of cowboy jokes, the oil-soaked cattle
barons will at least be warm this winter. And of course, the fact that John
Connally finally found an office he couldn't buy further increased Texans' hope
for the future.
But the development most characteristic of the year of the hyena occurred
late last December in Wilmington, Delaware. It was there that E.I. DuPont de
Nemours and Co. chose its new chief executive. DuPont has traditionally been
headed by a member of the colony of blue-bloods that have ruled the company
throughout its 172 year history. But in a dramatic break with tradition,
DuPont's Board of Directors chose Irving S. Shapiro as the new board chairman.
Shapiro, the son of a Jewish immigrant dry-cleaner, was doing very little cackling
or gloating over his appointment. But he could certainly be permitted a
chuckle.. ..

House scandals unfolded. The high-watermark of the "Impeach Nixon"
movement was the zenith of Massachusetts' collective pride, when a majority of
American's would have voted for George McGovern if given a second chance.
But virtue was not its own reward to the people of Massachusetts: they took
advantage of this opportunity to vaunt their foresight. "Impeachment Now"
bumper stickers are not nearly so popular on the states autos as the stickers
reading "Don't Blame Me, I'm From Massachusetts."
But a few vociferous voices stand apart from the crowd now crying for
impeachment. These are the long-time Nixon critics, whose prophetic cries for
impeachment years ago have made them the patron saints of the impeachment
movement. The foremost figure in this clan is its senior member — Helen
Gahagan Douglas. She has been a critic of Richard Nixon since their 1946
primary race for the Senate, when Representative Nixon accused her of being
"pink down to her underwear" — a statement which Mrs. Douglas resented not
so much as an intimation about her undergarments, but as a libelous insinuation
alleging her sympathy with the Communist Party. Mrs. Douglas nursed her
criticism in relative obscurity until last year, when her bitter experience with
Richard Nixon's "dirty tricks" made her one of the most influential voices in the
impeachment drive.
Lowenstein Alliance Grows
Another impeachment advocate redeemed by Mr. Nixon's recent troubles is
Allard Lowenstein. Lowenstein's Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) long
stood for the impeachment of President Nixon, but until 1973 neither
Lowenstein nor his ADA had been taken seriously. By the end of the year,
however, the ranks of ADA membership had swelled significantly. And not only
was Lowenstein able to win an impeachment debate on William Buckley's Firing
Line, but he is also considered a serious contender for a Senate seat from New
York.
Richard Nixon was not the only political figure humbled by the events of
1973; indeed, it was typical of the year of the hyena that an international host
of political leaders fell prey to their critics. Britain's Heath, Germany's Brandt,
Israel's Meir and Japan's Tanaka all suffered serious setbacks — Chile's Allende
and Greece's Papadopulos lost control entirely. The only world figure to increase
his clout during 1973 began the year in political obscurity — Saudi Arabia's King
Faisal.
The Arabs blundered to defeat on the battlefield despite the advantages that
surprise and the Russians had given them; Faisal, meanwhile, enjoyed the
diplomatic success of the oil embargo. Use of the embargo as a diplomatic tool,
however, only partially justifies Faisal's actions; the subsequent oil price hikes
and Arab visits to Western nations can only be termed flaunting of power. As
one Washington gadfly said on Sheik Yamani's departure; "He did nothing but
show off his mistletoe bustle."
Domestic Changes
The year of the hyena left its mark on world politics, but the most
encouraging turnabouts of 1973 were purely domestic. A lot of good news came
out of the South, where the pride of Texas' citizens increased dramatically.
Though they still bear the brunt of scores of cowboy jokes, the oil-soaked cattle
barons will at least be warm this winter. And of course, the fact that John
Connally finally found an office he couldn't buy further increased Texans' hope
for the future.
But the development most characteristic of the year of the hyena occurred
late last December in Wilmington, Delaware. It was there that E.I. DuPont de
Nemours and Co. chose its new chief executive. DuPont has traditionally been
headed by a member of the colony of blue-bloods that have ruled the company
throughout its 172 year history. But in a dramatic break with tradition,
DuPont's Board of Directors chose Irving S. Shapiro as the new board chairman.
Shapiro, the son of a Jewish immigrant dry-cleaner, was doing very little cackling
or gloating over his appointment. But he could certainly be permitted a
chuckle.. ..

Chinese astrologers long ago determined that 1973 would be the year of the
ox. But hindsight is more accurate than even the keenest stargazing, and in
retrospect it is apparent that 1973 was actually the year of the hyena. Only the
insane laughter of this animal can symbolize the tumult of a year in which the
uninfluential became the powerful; a year in which long-ignored, unpopular
causes became the concern of the majority; a year in which the impotent, in a
nouveau riche display of power, could occasionally stick their tongues out at the
world.

impeachment years ago have made them the patron saints of the impeachment
movement. The foremost figure in this clan is its senior member — Helen
Gahagan Douglas. She has been a critic of Richard Nixon since their 1946
primary race for the Senate, when Representative Nixon accused her of being
"pink down to her underwear" — a statement which Mrs. Douglas resented not
so much as an intimation about her undergarments, but as a libelous insinuation
alleging her sympathy with the Communist Party. Mrs. Douglas nursed her
criticism in relative obscurity until last year, when her bitter experience with
Richard Nixon's "dirty tricks" made her one of the most influential voices in the
impeachment drive.
Lowenstein Alliance Grows
Another impeachment advocate redeemed by Mr. Nixon's recent troubles is
Allard Lowenstein. Lowenstein's Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) long
stood for the impeachment of President Nixon, but until 1973 neither
Lowenstein nor his ADA had been taken seriously. By the end of the year,
however, the ranks of ADA membership had swelled significantly. And not only
was Lowenstein able to win an impeachment debate on William Buckley's Firing
Line, but he is also considered a serious contender for a Senate seat from New
York.
Richard Nixon was not the only political figure humbled by the events of
1973; indeed, it was typical of the year of the hyena that an international host
of political leaders fell prey to their critics. Britain's Heath, Germany's Brandt,
Israel's Meir and Japan's Tanaka all suffered serious setbacks — Chile's Allende
and Greece's Papadopulos lost control entirely. The only world figure to increase
his clout during 1973 began the year in political obscurity — Saudi Arabia's King
Faisal.
The Arabs blundered to defeat on the battlefield despite the advantages that
surprise and the Russians had given them; Faisal, meanwhile, enjoyed the
diplomatic success of the oil embargo. Use of the embargo as a diplomatic tool,
however, only partially justifies Faisal's actions; the subsequent oil price hikes
and Arab visits to Western nations can only be termed flaunting of power. As
one Washington gadfly said on Sheik Yamani's departure; "He did nothing but
show off his mistletoe bustle."
Domestic Changes
The year of the hyena left its mark on world politics, but the most
encouraging turnabouts of 1973 were purely domestic. A lot of good news came
out of the South, where the pride of Texas' citizens increased dramatically.
Though they still bear the brunt of scores of cowboy jokes, the oil-soaked cattle
barons will at least be warm this winter. And of course, the fact that John
Connally finally found an office he couldn't buy further increased Texans' hope
for the future.
But the development most characteristic of the year of the hyena occurred
late last December in Wilmington, Delaware. It was there that E.I. DuPont de
Nemours and Co. chose its new chief executive. DuPont has traditionally been
headed by a member of the colony of blue-bloods that have ruled the company
throughout its 172 year history. But in a dramatic break with tradition,
DuPont's Board of Directors chose Irving S. Shapiro as the new board chairman.
Shapiro, the son of a Jewish immigrant dry-cleaner, was doing very little cackling
or gloating over his appointment. But he could certainly be permitted a
chuckle.. ..
