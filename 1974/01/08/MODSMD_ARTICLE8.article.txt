# Vietnam Cease-Fire Breaks Down
## U.S. Continues Support To Southeast Asia

(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion of
a two-part series.)
The Nixon Administration must bear a large part
of the responsibility for the breakdown of the
Vietnam cease-fire. It has systematically violated
key provisions of the agreement, condoned or
encouraged South Vietnamese violations, and
financed Saigon's entire post-ceasefire war effort.
The U.S. government, according to the LA
Times, "directly and indirectly underwrites all
South Vietnamese military expenditures. The South
Vietnamese budget is hopelessly out of balance
without such help." Actually, the United States
now foots about 90 percent of the Thieu
Administration's entire budget. "Saigon officials
readily admit that without massive U.S. aid, their
cause is doomed," writes the Wall Street Journal.
Last November, Nixon signed into law a Defense
Department appropriations bill granting South
Vietnam and Laos $1.1 billion in military aid, and
banning any reconstruction aid to North Vietnam,
in direct violation of the Paris agreement.
Presumably it is with these funds that the Defense
Department supplies Saigon with 22,000 barrels of
oil a day. And this sum does not include the almost
$600 million that Congress appropriated to Thieu
and Lon Nol through the Agency for International
Development.
At least another $30 million of military aid will
accrue to the Saigon government through a special
provision in the "Food for Peace" program which
helps support the Saigon prison system.
Thousands of U.S. military and technical
personnel remain in Vietnam to advise the South
Vietnamese military at all levels. The LA Times
noted on November 29 that "While many of the
new experts or technicians (or advisors) will be
wearing civilian sportshirts, the suspicion is strong
that underneath they will have dogtags, or at least
retirement papers. . . . One staff officer, already
sporting civilian clothes much of the time, admits
that the biggest change in his office will be the
removal of some awards and military knicknacks,
including a mounted AK-47 rifle, which would not
fit his 'new' identity."
Manpower Solicited
Some military personnel are being sent into
South Vietnam on "temporary duty" from
Thailand. But many others are now permanently
stationed in Vietnam in the employ of the CIA,
AID, or one of the many companies under contract
to the Department of Defense. These companies,
including Lear Siegler Inc., ITT Federal Electric
Corp., and Northrop Page are charged with
maintaining Thieu's vast and sophisticated air force
and his country-wide communications system.

Hundreds of notices for former military
personnel have appeared in newspapers around the
country, advertising "immediate openings" for
aircraft technicians, crew chiefs, propeller
specialists, airborne radio and navigational
technicians, and helicopter mechanics. Due to the
high pay offered by these companies through the
Defense Department, there are already some 20,000
"civilian" experts in South Vietnam handling the
war effort, according to Jack Anderson. Indeed,
congressman Les Aspin notes that the total value of
such U.S. defense contracts for goods and services in
Southeast Asia was $3 million higher last April 1
than it was when the cease-fire was signed.
The U.S. not only maintains but also supplies
Thieu's airforce with the latest equipment, despite
prohibitions against such unwarranted additions to
Saigon's military capability. The Nixon
Administration is replacing jet fighters destroyed
since the "cease-fire" with 100 brand new,
sophisticated F-5E supersonic fighter-bombers
which will outclass anything Saigon already has.
About 100 Saigon pilots are currently being trained
in Arizona to fly these new planes, along with the
technicians to service them.
Contempt For Peace
From the beginning, the Nixon Administration
displayedcontemptfor the peace agreement. Even as
he announced its signing, Nixon violated the spirit
of the accord by recognizing the Thieu regime as
"the whole legitimate government of South
Vietnam."
While he left the Saigon government to carry out
the most massive cease-fire violations, Nixon
repeatedly made it clear to the PRG and North
Vietnam that he would scrap the entire agreement if
necessary to save Thieu. The agreement states
specifically that "The United States will remove,
permanently deactivate or destroy all the mines in
the territorial waters, ports, harbors and waterways
of North Vietnam as soon as this agreement goes
into effect." To show its displeasure with the North,
the United States delayed its mine sweeping
operations and ultimately deactivated only a few
mines. It left North Vietnam the hazardous duty of
cleaning them out of inland waterways, where they
threatened the fragile dike system.
Likewise, the U.S. continued (and still conducts)
illegal reconnaissance flights over North Vietnam —
a clear indication that the bombing might be
resumed. "The two actions ... are similar to the
bombing of Laos this week." said one U.S. official
shortly after the cease-fire. "They are efforts to
convince the Communists we mean business."
The rest of Indochina still feels the U.S. presence

too. One day after a formal cease-fire took effect in
Laos last February, the U.S. launched a massive
B-52 attack on Pathet Lao positions in northern
Laos. The CIA still illegally maintains a large force
of up to 20,000 Thai mercenaries in Laos (not to
mention its Meo tribesmen), according to Nixon's
former Ambassador to Laos, at a cost of $26 million
a year.
Far Eastern Economic Review reports that the
CIA is prepared for a massive financial intervention
in the upcoming Laotion elections to defeat the
communist Pathet Lao candidates.
Holding to his pledge to "stand firmly" by the
Phnom Penh regime "in facing the current
challenge," Nixon maintains U.S. presence in
Cambodia. Long after the signing of the Paris
accords, of course, U.S. bombers continued their
relentless hammering of the Cambodian
countryside, in some of the heaviest raids of the
war. In the month of May alone, the U.S. dropped
107 million pounds of bombs, more than was
dropped on Cambodia in all of 1972.
The Senate Subcommittee on Refugees reports
that nearly half of Cambodia's entire civilian
population has been made homeless by the
bombing; U.S. military sources admit that the
bombing killed about 700 civilians each day. One
B-52 caused 400 casualties in the Neak Luong
tragedy. The U.S. flew an average of 60 B-52s every
day.
Planes Over Cambodia
The day of the bombing halt, Nixon pledged to
"continue to supply the maximum amount of
economic and military assistance permitted" to the
Lon Nol government. The same day the Pentagon
announced that it could still order bombing raids in
retaliation for attacks on reconnaissance or military
supply planes which still fly regularly over
Cambodia. And two days later the Pentagon
announced its plan to equip South Vietnamese
forces to invade Cambodia by land and air to aid
our tottering ally. The GAO has announced that
contrary to a specific congressional ban on such
activities, the Defense Department still maintains a
73 man military advisory team in Cambodia.
Finally, a Reuters dispatch from Phnom Penh on
Dec. 20 indicates that once again U.S. pilots are
flying bombing missions against guerrilla positions
within Cambodia. Who is going to stop them?
The United States still spends over $1 billion a
year to train, finance, and equip the armies and
paramilitary forces of dictatorial governments in
Indochina. Much of this activity is illegal, most is
covert, and all is immoral. Nixon's "Peace with
Honor" is a sham and we must demand an
immediate end to America's underwriting of war in
Southeast Asia.

Thailand. But many others are now permanently
stationed in Vietnam in the employ of the CIA,
AID, or one of the many companies under contract
to the Department of Defense. These companies,
including Lear Siegler Inc., ITT Federal Electric
Corp., and Northrop Page are charged with
maintaining Thieu's vast and sophisticated air force
and his country-wide communications system.

Hundreds of notices for former military
personnel have appeared in newspapers around the
country, advertising "immediate openings" for
aircraft technicians, crew chiefs, propeller
specialists, airborne radio and navigational
technicians, and helicopter mechanics. Due to the
high pay offered by these companies through the
Defense Department, there are already some 20,000
"civilian" experts in South Vietnam handling the
war effort, according to Jack Anderson. Indeed,
congressman Les Aspin notes that the total value of
such U.S. defense contracts for goods and services in
Southeast Asia was $3 million higher last April 1
than it was when the cease-fire was signed.
The U.S. not only maintains but also supplies
Thieu's airforce with the latest equipment, despite
prohibitions against such unwarranted additions to
Saigon's military capability. The Nixon
Administration is replacing jet fighters destroyed
since the "cease-fire" with 100 brand new,
sophisticated F-5E supersonic fighter-bombers
which will outclass anything Saigon already has.
About 100 Saigon pilots are currently being trained
in Arizona to fly these new planes, along with the
technicians to service them.
Contempt For Peace
From the beginning, the Nixon Administration
displayedcontemptfor the peace agreement. Even as
he announced its signing, Nixon violated the spirit
of the accord by recognizing the Thieu regime as
"the whole legitimate government of South
Vietnam."
While he left the Saigon government to carry out
the most massive cease-fire violations, Nixon
repeatedly made it clear to the PRG and North
Vietnam that he would scrap the entire agreement if
necessary to save Thieu. The agreement states
specifically that "The United States will remove,
permanently deactivate or destroy all the mines in
the territorial waters, ports, harbors and waterways
of North Vietnam as soon as this agreement goes
into effect." To show its displeasure with the North,
the United States delayed its mine sweeping
operations and ultimately deactivated only a few
mines. It left North Vietnam the hazardous duty of
cleaning them out of inland waterways, where they
threatened the fragile dike system.
Likewise, the U.S. continued (and still conducts)
illegal reconnaissance flights over North Vietnam —
a clear indication that the bombing might be
resumed. "The two actions ... are similar to the
bombing of Laos this week." said one U.S. official
shortly after the cease-fire. "They are efforts to
convince the Communists we mean business."
The rest of Indochina still feels the U.S. presence

too. One day after a formal cease-fire took effect in
Laos last February, the U.S. launched a massive
B-52 attack on Pathet Lao positions in northern
Laos. The CIA still illegally maintains a large force
of up to 20,000 Thai mercenaries in Laos (not to
mention its Meo tribesmen), according to Nixon's
former Ambassador to Laos, at a cost of $26 million
a year.
Far Eastern Economic Review reports that the
CIA is prepared for a massive financial intervention
in the upcoming Laotion elections to defeat the
communist Pathet Lao candidates.
Holding to his pledge to "stand firmly" by the
Phnom Penh regime "in facing the current
challenge," Nixon maintains U.S. presence in
Cambodia. Long after the signing of the Paris
accords, of course, U.S. bombers continued their
relentless hammering of the Cambodian
countryside, in some of the heaviest raids of the
war. In the month of May alone, the U.S. dropped
107 million pounds of bombs, more than was
dropped on Cambodia in all of 1972.
The Senate Subcommittee on Refugees reports
that nearly half of Cambodia's entire civilian
population has been made homeless by the
bombing; U.S. military sources admit that the
bombing killed about 700 civilians each day. One
B-52 caused 400 casualties in the Neak Luong
tragedy. The U.S. flew an average of 60 B-52s every
day.
Planes Over Cambodia
The day of the bombing halt, Nixon pledged to
"continue to supply the maximum amount of
economic and military assistance permitted" to the
Lon Nol government. The same day the Pentagon
announced that it could still order bombing raids in
retaliation for attacks on reconnaissance or military
supply planes which still fly regularly over
Cambodia. And two days later the Pentagon
announced its plan to equip South Vietnamese
forces to invade Cambodia by land and air to aid
our tottering ally. The GAO has announced that
contrary to a specific congressional ban on such
activities, the Defense Department still maintains a
73 man military advisory team in Cambodia.
Finally, a Reuters dispatch from Phnom Penh on
Dec. 20 indicates that once again U.S. pilots are
flying bombing missions against guerrilla positions
within Cambodia. Who is going to stop them?
The United States still spends over $1 billion a
year to train, finance, and equip the armies and
paramilitary forces of dictatorial governments in
Indochina. Much of this activity is illegal, most is
covert, and all is immoral. Nixon's "Peace with
Honor" is a sham and we must demand an
immediate end to America's underwriting of war in
Southeast Asia.

The Nixon Administration must bear a large part
of the responsibility for the breakdown of the
Vietnam cease-fire. It has systematically violated
key provisions of the agreement, condoned or
encouraged South Vietnamese violations, and
financed Saigon's entire post-ceasefire war effort.
The U.S. government, according to the LA
Times, "directly and indirectly underwrites all
South Vietnamese military expenditures. The South
Vietnamese budget is hopelessly out of balance
without such help." Actually, the United States
now foots about 90 percent of the Thieu
Administration's entire budget. "Saigon officials
readily admit that without massive U.S. aid, their
cause is doomed," writes the Wall Street Journal.
Last November, Nixon signed into law a Defense
Department appropriations bill granting South
Vietnam and Laos $1.1 billion in military aid, and
banning any reconstruction aid to North Vietnam,
in direct violation of the Paris agreement.
Presumably it is with these funds that the Defense
Department supplies Saigon with 22,000 barrels of
oil a day. And this sum does not include the almost
$600 million that Congress appropriated to Thieu
and Lon Nol through the Agency for International
Development.
At least another $30 million of military aid will
accrue to the Saigon government through a special
provision in the "Food for Peace" program which
helps support the Saigon prison system.
Thousands of U.S. military and technical
personnel remain in Vietnam to advise the South
Vietnamese military at all levels. The LA Times
noted on November 29 that "While many of the
new experts or technicians (or advisors) will be
wearing civilian sportshirts, the suspicion is strong
that underneath they will have dogtags, or at least
retirement papers. . . . One staff officer, already
sporting civilian clothes much of the time, admits
that the biggest change in his office will be the
removal of some awards and military knicknacks,
including a mounted AK-47 rifle, which would not
fit his 'new' identity."

into effect." To show its displeasure with the North,
the United States delayed its mine sweeping
operations and ultimately deactivated only a few
mines. It left North Vietnam the hazardous duty of
cleaning them out of inland waterways, where they
threatened the fragile dike system.
Likewise, the U.S. continued (and still conducts)
illegal reconnaissance flights over North Vietnam —
a clear indication that the bombing might be
resumed. "The two actions ... are similar to the
bombing of Laos this week." said one U.S. official
shortly after the cease-fire. "They are efforts to
convince the Communists we mean business."
The rest of Indochina still feels the U.S. presence

too. One day after a formal cease-fire took effect in
Laos last February, the U.S. launched a massive
B-52 attack on Pathet Lao positions in northern
Laos. The CIA still illegally maintains a large force
of up to 20,000 Thai mercenaries in Laos (not to
mention its Meo tribesmen), according to Nixon's
former Ambassador to Laos, at a cost of $26 million
a year.
Far Eastern Economic Review reports that the
CIA is prepared for a massive financial intervention
in the upcoming Laotion elections to defeat the
communist Pathet Lao candidates.
Holding to his pledge to "stand firmly" by the
Phnom Penh regime "in facing the current
challenge," Nixon maintains U.S. presence in
Cambodia. Long after the signing of the Paris
accords, of course, U.S. bombers continued their
relentless hammering of the Cambodian
countryside, in some of the heaviest raids of the
war. In the month of May alone, the U.S. dropped
107 million pounds of bombs, more than was
dropped on Cambodia in all of 1972.
The Senate Subcommittee on Refugees reports
that nearly half of Cambodia's entire civilian
population has been made homeless by the
bombing; U.S. military sources admit that the
bombing killed about 700 civilians each day. One
B-52 caused 400 casualties in the Neak Luong
tragedy. The U.S. flew an average of 60 B-52s every
day.
Planes Over Cambodia
The day of the bombing halt, Nixon pledged to
"continue to supply the maximum amount of
economic and military assistance permitted" to the
Lon Nol government. The same day the Pentagon
announced that it could still order bombing raids in
retaliation for attacks on reconnaissance or military
supply planes which still fly regularly over
Cambodia. And two days later the Pentagon
announced its plan to equip South Vietnamese
forces to invade Cambodia by land and air to aid
our tottering ally. The GAO has announced that
contrary to a specific congressional ban on such
activities, the Defense Department still maintains a
73 man military advisory team in Cambodia.
Finally, a Reuters dispatch from Phnom Penh on
Dec. 20 indicates that once again U.S. pilots are
flying bombing missions against guerrilla positions
within Cambodia. Who is going to stop them?
The United States still spends over $1 billion a
year to train, finance, and equip the armies and
paramilitary forces of dictatorial governments in
Indochina. Much of this activity is illegal, most is
covert, and all is immoral. Nixon's "Peace with
Honor" is a sham and we must demand an
immediate end to America's underwriting of war in
Southeast Asia.

The Nixon Administration must bear a large part
of the responsibility for the breakdown of the
Vietnam cease-fire. It has systematically violated
key provisions of the agreement, condoned or
encouraged South Vietnamese violations, and
financed Saigon's entire post-ceasefire war effort.
The U.S. government, according to the LA
Times, "directly and indirectly underwrites all
South Vietnamese military expenditures. The South
Vietnamese budget is hopelessly out of balance
without such help." Actually, the United States
now foots about 90 percent of the Thieu
Administration's entire budget. "Saigon officials
readily admit that without massive U.S. aid, their
cause is doomed," writes the Wall Street Journal.
Last November, Nixon signed into law a Defense
Department appropriations bill granting South
Vietnam and Laos $1.1 billion in military aid, and
banning any reconstruction aid to North Vietnam,
in direct violation of the Paris agreement.
Presumably it is with these funds that the Defense
Department supplies Saigon with 22,000 barrels of
oil a day. And this sum does not include the almost
$600 million that Congress appropriated to Thieu
and Lon Nol through the Agency for International
Development.
At least another $30 million of military aid will
accrue to the Saigon government through a special
provision in the "Food for Peace" program which
helps support the Saigon prison system.
Thousands of U.S. military and technical
personnel remain in Vietnam to advise the South
Vietnamese military at all levels. The LA Times
noted on November 29 that "While many of the
new experts or technicians (or advisors) will be
wearing civilian sportshirts, the suspicion is strong
that underneath they will have dogtags, or at least
retirement papers. . . . One staff officer, already
sporting civilian clothes much of the time, admits
that the biggest change in his office will be the
removal of some awards and military knicknacks,
including a mounted AK-47 rifle, which would not
fit his 'new' identity."
Manpower Solicited
Some military personnel are being sent into
South Vietnam on "temporary duty" from
Thailand. But many others are now permanently
stationed in Vietnam in the employ of the CIA,
AID, or one of the many companies under contract
to the Department of Defense. These companies,
including Lear Siegler Inc., ITT Federal Electric
Corp., and Northrop Page are charged with
maintaining Thieu's vast and sophisticated air force
and his country-wide communications system.

Hundreds of notices for former military
personnel have appeared in newspapers around the
country, advertising "immediate openings" for
aircraft technicians, crew chiefs, propeller
specialists, airborne radio and navigational
technicians, and helicopter mechanics. Due to the
high pay offered by these companies through the
Defense Department, there are already some 20,000
"civilian" experts in South Vietnam handling the
war effort, according to Jack Anderson. Indeed,
congressman Les Aspin notes that the total value of
such U.S. defense contracts for goods and services in
Southeast Asia was $3 million higher last April 1
than it was when the cease-fire was signed.
The U.S. not only maintains but also supplies
Thieu's airforce with the latest equipment, despite
prohibitions against such unwarranted additions to
Saigon's military capability. The Nixon
Administration is replacing jet fighters destroyed
since the "cease-fire" with 100 brand new,
sophisticated F-5E supersonic fighter-bombers
which will outclass anything Saigon already has.
About 100 Saigon pilots are currently being trained
in Arizona to fly these new planes, along with the
technicians to service them.
Contempt For Peace
From the beginning, the Nixon Administration
displayedcontemptfor the peace agreement. Even as
he announced its signing, Nixon violated the spirit
of the accord by recognizing the Thieu regime as
"the whole legitimate government of South
Vietnam."
While he left the Saigon government to carry out
the most massive cease-fire violations, Nixon
repeatedly made it clear to the PRG and North
Vietnam that he would scrap the entire agreement if
necessary to save Thieu. The agreement states
specifically that "The United States will remove,
permanently deactivate or destroy all the mines in
the territorial waters, ports, harbors and waterways
of North Vietnam as soon as this agreement goes
into effect." To show its displeasure with the North,
the United States delayed its mine sweeping
operations and ultimately deactivated only a few
mines. It left North Vietnam the hazardous duty of
cleaning them out of inland waterways, where they

The day of the bombing halt, Nixon pledged to
"continue to supply the maximum amount of
economic and military assistance permitted" to the
Lon Nol government. The same day the Pentagon
announced that it could still order bombing raids in
retaliation for attacks on reconnaissance or military
supply planes which still fly regularly over
Cambodia. And two days later the Pentagon
announced its plan to equip South Vietnamese
forces to invade Cambodia by land and air to aid
our tottering ally. The GAO has announced that
contrary to a specific congressional ban on such
activities, the Defense Department still maintains a
73 man military advisory team in Cambodia.
Finally, a Reuters dispatch from Phnom Penh on
Dec. 20 indicates that once again U.S. pilots are
flying bombing missions against guerrilla positions
within Cambodia. Who is going to stop them?
The United States still spends over $1 billion a
year to train, finance, and equip the armies and
paramilitary forces of dictatorial governments in
Indochina. Much of this activity is illegal, most is
covert, and all is immoral. Nixon's "Peace with
Honor" is a sham and we must demand an
immediate end to America's underwriting of war in
Southeast Asia.

The Nixon Administration must bear a large part
of the responsibility for the breakdown of the
Vietnam cease-fire. It has systematically violated
key provisions of the agreement, condoned or
encouraged South Vietnamese violations, and
financed Saigon's entire post-ceasefire war effort.
The U.S. government, according to the LA
Times, "directly and indirectly underwrites all
South Vietnamese military expenditures. The South
Vietnamese budget is hopelessly out of balance
without such help." Actually, the United States
now foots about 90 percent of the Thieu
Administration's entire budget. "Saigon officials
readily admit that without massive U.S. aid, their
cause is doomed," writes the Wall Street Journal.
Last November, Nixon signed into law a Defense
Department appropriations bill granting South
Vietnam and Laos $1.1 billion in military aid, and
banning any reconstruction aid to North Vietnam,
in direct violation of the Paris agreement.
Presumably it is with these funds that the Defense
Department supplies Saigon with 22,000 barrels of
oil a day. And this sum does not include the almost
$600 million that Congress appropriated to Thieu
and Lon Nol through the Agency for International
Development.
At least another $30 million of military aid will
accrue to the Saigon government through a special
provision in the "Food for Peace" program which
helps support the Saigon prison system.
Thousands of U.S. military and technical
personnel remain in Vietnam to advise the South
Vietnamese military at all levels. The LA Times
noted on November 29 that "While many of the
new experts or technicians (or advisors) will be
wearing civilian sportshirts, the suspicion is strong
that underneath they will have dogtags, or at least
retirement papers. . . . One staff officer, already
sporting civilian clothes much of the time, admits
that the biggest change in his office will be the
removal of some awards and military knicknacks,
including a mounted AK-47 rifle, which would not
fit his 'new' identity."
Manpower Solicited
Some military personnel are being sent into
South Vietnam on "temporary duty" from
Thailand. But many others are now permanently
stationed in Vietnam in the employ of the CIA,
AID, or one of the many companies under contract
to the Department of Defense. These companies,
including Lear Siegler Inc., ITT Federal Electric
Corp., and Northrop Page are charged with
maintaining Thieu's vast and sophisticated air force
and his country-wide communications system.

Hundreds of notices for former military
personnel have appeared in newspapers around the
country, advertising "immediate openings" for
aircraft technicians, crew chiefs, propeller
specialists, airborne radio and navigational
technicians, and helicopter mechanics. Due to the
high pay offered by these companies through the
Defense Department, there are already some 20,000
"civilian" experts in South Vietnam handling the
war effort, according to Jack Anderson. Indeed,
congressman Les Aspin notes that the total value of
such U.S. defense contracts for goods and services in
Southeast Asia was $3 million higher last April 1
than it was when the cease-fire was signed.
The U.S. not only maintains but also supplies
Thieu's airforce with the latest equipment, despite
prohibitions against such unwarranted additions to
Saigon's military capability. The Nixon
Administration is replacing jet fighters destroyed
since the "cease-fire" with 100 brand new,
sophisticated F-5E supersonic fighter-bombers
which will outclass anything Saigon already has.
About 100 Saigon pilots are currently being trained
in Arizona to fly these new planes, along with the
technicians to service them.
Contempt For Peace
From the beginning, the Nixon Administration
displayedcontemptfor the peace agreement. Even as
he announced its signing, Nixon violated the spirit
of the accord by recognizing the Thieu regime as
"the whole legitimate government of South
Vietnam."
While he left the Saigon government to carry out
the most massive cease-fire violations, Nixon
repeatedly made it clear to the PRG and North
Vietnam that he would scrap the entire agreement if
necessary to save Thieu. The agreement states
specifically that "The United States will remove,
permanently deactivate or destroy all the mines in
the territorial waters, ports, harbors and waterways
of North Vietnam as soon as this agreement goes
into effect." To show its displeasure with the North,
the United States delayed its mine sweeping
operations and ultimately deactivated only a few
mines. It left North Vietnam the hazardous duty of
cleaning them out of inland waterways, where they
threatened the fragile dike system.
Likewise, the U.S. continued (and still conducts)
illegal reconnaissance flights over North Vietnam —
a clear indication that the bombing might be
resumed. "The two actions ... are similar to the
bombing of Laos this week." said one U.S. official
shortly after the cease-fire. "They are efforts to
convince the Communists we mean business."
The rest of Indochina still feels the U.S. presence

too. One day after a formal cease-fire took effect in
Laos last February, the U.S. launched a massive
B-52 attack on Pathet Lao positions in northern
Laos. The CIA still illegally maintains a large force
of up to 20,000 Thai mercenaries in Laos (not to
mention its Meo tribesmen), according to Nixon's
former Ambassador to Laos, at a cost of $26 million
a year.
Far Eastern Economic Review reports that the
CIA is prepared for a massive financial intervention
in the upcoming Laotion elections to defeat the
communist Pathet Lao candidates.
Holding to his pledge to "stand firmly" by the
Phnom Penh regime "in facing the current
challenge," Nixon maintains U.S. presence in
Cambodia. Long after the signing of the Paris
accords, of course, U.S. bombers continued their
relentless hammering of the Cambodian
countryside, in some of the heaviest raids of the
war. In the month of May alone, the U.S. dropped
107 million pounds of bombs, more than was
dropped on Cambodia in all of 1972.
The Senate Subcommittee on Refugees reports
that nearly half of Cambodia's entire civilian
population has been made homeless by the
bombing; U.S. military sources admit that the
bombing killed about 700 civilians each day. One
B-52 caused 400 casualties in the Neak Luong
tragedy. The U.S. flew an average of 60 B-52s every
day.
