# Nixon-- Politics In Milk Deal
## 
### 
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -
President Nixon acknowledged
yesterday that he took "traditional
political considerations" into account
when he ordered a controversial 1971
hike in federal milk price supports.
But, in a pair of "white papers"
issued by the White House, Nixon
denied that pledges of campaign
contributions influenced his action in
the milk case or in settlement of an
ITT antitrust case.
Releasing the statements as part of
Nixon's so-called Operation Candor,
the White House said no presidential
documents, files or tape recordings
were being released "in view of the
fact they are on file with the special
prosecutor."
Major Points
The major points in the statements
prepared by Nixon's attorneys were:
— The President faced "first and
foremost.. . intensive congressional
pressure" to increase milk price
supports, and that he also took into
account "economic merits of the case"
and "traditional political
considerations relating to the needs of
the farm states."
— Nixon "had been informed of the
dairy industry's intentions to raise
funds for the 1972 campaign,"
although the White House asserted
that the pledges were not discussed in
presidential meetings on the milk price
support increase.
— Nixon "did not direct the
settlement or participate in the
settlement negotiations directly or
indirectly" in the antitrust case against
the International Telephone &
Telegraph Co., although he did order
that an appeal in one ITT case be
dropped — an instruction he rescinded
two days later.
— At the time, the President "was
unaware of any commitment by ITT"
to contribute up to $450,000 toward
expenses of the Republican National
Convention.
Consequences 'Beneficial'
The 17-page statement on the milk
case said the economic consequences
of the President's decision "have been
beneficial to the entire country."
The statement said "the political
power of the dairy industry lobby"
was brought to Nixon's attention at
the meeting by then-Secretary of the
Treasury John Connally who was
quoted as having said, "their votes
would be important in several
midwestern states" and that the
industry would be making 1972
campaign contributions in
congressional races.
It said that neither Connally "nor
anyone else discussed possible
contributions to the President's
campaign."
Nixon himself concluded, the White
House said, "that the final decision
