# Nixon-- Politics In Milk Deal
## 
### 
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -
President Nixon acknowledged
yesterday that he took "traditional
political considerations" into account
when he ordered a controversial 1971
hike in federal milk price supports.
But, in a pair of "white papers"
issued by the White House, Nixon
denied that pledges of campaign
contributions influenced his action in
the milk case or in settlement of an
ITT antitrust case.
Releasing the statements as part of
Nixon's so-called Operation Candor,
the White House said no presidential
documents, files or tape recordings
were being released "in view of the
fact they are on file with the special
prosecutor."
Major Points
The major points in the statements
prepared by Nixon's attorneys were:
— The President faced "first and
foremost.. . intensive congressional
pressure" to increase milk price
supports, and that he also took into
account "economic merits of the case"
and "traditional political
considerations relating to the needs of
the farm states."
— Nixon "had been informed of the
dairy industry's intentions to raise
funds for the 1972 campaign,"
although the White House asserted
that the pledges were not discussed in
presidential meetings on the milk price
support increase.
— Nixon "did not direct the
settlement or participate in the
settlement negotiations directly or
indirectly" in the antitrust case against
the International Telephone &
Telegraph Co., although he did order
that an appeal in one ITT case be
dropped — an instruction he rescinded
two days later.
— At the time, the President "was
unaware of any commitment by ITT"
to contribute up to $450,000 toward
expenses of the Republican National
Convention.
Consequences 'Beneficial'
The 17-page statement on the milk
case said the economic consequences
of the President's decision "have been
beneficial to the entire country."
The statement said "the political
power of the dairy industry lobby"
was brought to Nixon's attention at
the meeting by then-Secretary of the
Treasury John Connally who was
quoted as having said, "their votes
would be important in several
midwestern states" and that the
industry would be making 1972
campaign contributions in
congressional races.
It said that neither Connally "nor
anyone else discussed possible
contributions to the President's
campaign."
Nixon himself concluded, the White
House said, "that the final decision
came down to the fact that the
Congress was going to pass the higher
support legislation, and he could not
veto it without alienating the farmers
— an essential part of his political
constituency."
After saying it was also believed
that a 1971 hike in support levels
would preclude similar action in the
1972 election year and thus hold the
price line for two years, the statement
said:
Fundamental Themes
"The fundamental theme running
through this March 23 meeting were
two: First, the unique and very heavy
pressures being placed upon the
President by the Democratic majority
leadership in the Congress and, second,
the political advantages and
disadvantages of making a decision
regarding a vital political
constituency."
The White House statement quoted
Sen. George McGovern of South
Dakota, who was to become Nixon's
1972 Democratic opponent, as having
applauded Nixon's decision to approve
higher supports. It quoted McGovern
as saying on April 1, 1971: "This
reversal can be considered a victory for
those in Congress who spoke out
vigorously on behalf of the dairy
farmers."
The White House said the dairy
industry contributed $437,000 to
Nixon's 1972 campaign but added:
"It is also worth noting that the
ultimate contributions by the dairy
industry to the President's re-election
effort:

were far less than the industry
leaders had hoped to raise;
— were far less than the dairy
industry gave to other candidates for
the House and Senate, including many
Democrats and;
— represented less than one percent
of the total contributions to President
Nixon's re-election campaign."
Democratic Support
The White House statement dealt at
length with Democratic support in
Congress for higher milk supports and
said White House discussions took
note of the fact that legislation to
force higher supports "had the support
of two of the powerful legislators in
the country — Speaker of the House of
Representatives Carl Albert and
Chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee Wilbur Mills." Both
are Democrats.
The eight-page statement on the
ITT case said there was no relation
between the out-of-court antitrust
settlement and ITT's payment of
$100,000 as part of its pledge to help
underwrite the Republican National
Convention.
The statement asserted that
settlement of the ITT case avoided a
Supreme Court ruling "and caused the
corporation to undertake the largest
single divestiture in corporate
history."
During the 1968 presidential
campaign, the statement asserted,
Nixon made clear that he sought an
antitrust policy free of "unnecessary
government interference with free
enterprise."

case said the economic consequences
of the President's decision "have been
beneficial to the entire country."
The statement said "the political
power of the dairy industry lobby"
was brought to Nixon's attention at
the meeting by then-Secretary of the
Treasury John Connally who was
quoted as having said, "their votes
would be important in several
midwestern states" and that the
industry would be making 1972
campaign contributions in
congressional races.
It said that neither Connally "nor
anyone else discussed possible
contributions to the President's
campaign."
Nixon himself concluded, the White
House said, "that the final decision
came down to the fact that the
Congress was going to pass the higher
support legislation, and he could not
veto it without alienating the farmers
— an essential part of his political
constituency."
After saying it was also believed
that a 1971 hike in support levels
would preclude similar action in the
1972 election year and thus hold the
price line for two years, the statement
said:
Fundamental Themes
"The fundamental theme running
through this March 23 meeting were
two: First, the unique and very heavy
pressures being placed upon the
President by the Democratic majority
leadership in the Congress and, second,
the political advantages and
disadvantages of making a decision
regarding a vital political
constituency."
The White House statement quoted
Sen. George McGovern of South
Dakota, who was to become Nixon's
1972 Democratic opponent, as having
applauded Nixon's decision to approve
higher supports. It quoted McGovern
as saying on April 1, 1971: "This
reversal can be considered a victory for
those in Congress who spoke out
vigorously on behalf of the dairy
farmers."
The White House said the dairy
industry contributed $437,000 to
Nixon's 1972 campaign but added:
"It is also worth noting that the
ultimate contributions by the dairy
industry to the President's re-election
effort:

were far less than the industry
leaders had hoped to raise;
— were far less than the dairy
industry gave to other candidates for
the House and Senate, including many
Democrats and;
— represented less than one percent
of the total contributions to President
Nixon's re-election campaign."
Democratic Support
The White House statement dealt at
length with Democratic support in
Congress for higher milk supports and
said White House discussions took
note of the fact that legislation to
force higher supports "had the support
of two of the powerful legislators in
the country — Speaker of the House of
Representatives Carl Albert and
Chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee Wilbur Mills." Both
are Democrats.
The eight-page statement on the
ITT case said there was no relation
between the out-of-court antitrust
settlement and ITT's payment of
$100,000 as part of its pledge to help
underwrite the Republican National
Convention.
The statement asserted that
settlement of the ITT case avoided a
Supreme Court ruling "and caused the
corporation to undertake the largest
single divestiture in corporate
history."
During the 1968 presidential
campaign, the statement asserted,
Nixon made clear that he sought an
antitrust policy free of "unnecessary
government interference with free
enterprise."
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -
President Nixon acknowledged
yesterday that he took "traditional
political considerations" into account
when he ordered a controversial 1971
hike in federal milk price supports.
But, in a pair of "white papers"
issued by the White House, Nixon
denied that pledges of campaign
contributions influenced his action in
the milk case or in settlement of an
ITT antitrust case.
Releasing the statements as part of
Nixon's so-called Operation Candor,
the White House said no presidential
documents, files or tape recordings
were being released "in view of the
fact they are on file with the special
prosecutor."
Major Points
The major points in the statements
prepared by Nixon's attorneys were:
— The President faced "first and
foremost.. . intensive congressional
pressure" to increase milk price
supports, and that he also took into
account "economic merits of the case"
and "traditional political
considerations relating to the needs of
the farm states."
— Nixon "had been informed of the
dairy industry's intentions to raise
funds for the 1972 campaign,"
although the White House asserted
that the pledges were not discussed in
presidential meetings on the milk price
support increase.
— Nixon "did not direct the
settlement or participate in the
settlement negotiations directly or
indirectly" in the antitrust case against
the International Telephone &
Telegraph Co., although he did order
that an appeal in one ITT case be
dropped — an instruction he rescinded
two days later.
— At the time, the President "was
unaware of any commitment by ITT"
to contribute up to $450,000 toward
expenses of the Republican National
Convention.

The White House said the dairy
industry contributed $437,000 to
Nixon's 1972 campaign but added:
"It is also worth noting that the
ultimate contributions by the dairy
industry to the President's re-election
effort:

were far less than the industry
leaders had hoped to raise;
— were far less than the dairy
industry gave to other candidates for
the House and Senate, including many
Democrats and;
— represented less than one percent
of the total contributions to President
Nixon's re-election campaign."
Democratic Support
The White House statement dealt at
length with Democratic support in
Congress for higher milk supports and
said White House discussions took
note of the fact that legislation to
force higher supports "had the support
of two of the powerful legislators in
the country — Speaker of the House of
Representatives Carl Albert and
Chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee Wilbur Mills." Both
are Democrats.
The eight-page statement on the
ITT case said there was no relation
between the out-of-court antitrust
settlement and ITT's payment of
$100,000 as part of its pledge to help
underwrite the Republican National
Convention.
The statement asserted that
settlement of the ITT case avoided a
Supreme Court ruling "and caused the
corporation to undertake the largest
single divestiture in corporate
history."
During the 1968 presidential
campaign, the statement asserted,
Nixon made clear that he sought an
antitrust policy free of "unnecessary
government interference with free
enterprise."
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -
President Nixon acknowledged
yesterday that he took "traditional
political considerations" into account
when he ordered a controversial 1971
hike in federal milk price supports.
But, in a pair of "white papers"
issued by the White House, Nixon
denied that pledges of campaign
contributions influenced his action in
the milk case or in settlement of an
ITT antitrust case.
Releasing the statements as part of
Nixon's so-called Operation Candor,
the White House said no presidential
documents, files or tape recordings
were being released "in view of the
fact they are on file with the special
prosecutor."
Major Points
The major points in the statements
prepared by Nixon's attorneys were:
— The President faced "first and
foremost.. . intensive congressional
pressure" to increase milk price
supports, and that he also took into
account "economic merits of the case"
and "traditional political
considerations relating to the needs of
the farm states."
— Nixon "had been informed of the
dairy industry's intentions to raise
funds for the 1972 campaign,"
although the White House asserted
that the pledges were not discussed in
presidential meetings on the milk price
support increase.
— Nixon "did not direct the
settlement or participate in the
settlement negotiations directly or
indirectly" in the antitrust case against
the International Telephone &
Telegraph Co., although he did order
that an appeal in one ITT case be
dropped — an instruction he rescinded
two days later.
— At the time, the President "was
unaware of any commitment by ITT"
to contribute up to $450,000 toward
expenses of the Republican National
Convention.
Consequences 'Beneficial'
The 17-page statement on the milk
case said the economic consequences
of the President's decision "have been
beneficial to the entire country."
The statement said "the political
power of the dairy industry lobby"
was brought to Nixon's attention at
the meeting by then-Secretary of the
Treasury John Connally who was
quoted as having said, "their votes
would be important in several
midwestern states" and that the
industry would be making 1972
campaign contributions in
congressional races.
It said that neither Connally "nor
anyone else discussed possible
contributions to the President's
campaign."
Nixon himself concluded, the White
House said, "that the final decision
came down to the fact that the
Congress was going to pass the higher
support legislation, and he could not
veto it without alienating the farmers
— an essential part of his political
constituency."
After saying it was also believed
that a 1971 hike in support levels
would preclude similar action in the
1972 election year and thus hold the
price line for two years, the statement
said:
Fundamental Themes
"The fundamental theme running
through this March 23 meeting were
two: First, the unique and very heavy
pressures being placed upon the
President by the Democratic majority
leadership in the Congress and, second,
the political advantages and
disadvantages of making a decision
regarding a vital political
constituency."
The White House statement quoted
Sen. George McGovern of South
Dakota, who was to become Nixon's
1972 Democratic opponent, as having
applauded Nixon's decision to approve
higher supports. It quoted McGovern
as saying on April 1, 1971: "This
reversal can be considered a victory for
those in Congress who spoke out
vigorously on behalf of the dairy
farmers."
