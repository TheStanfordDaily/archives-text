# Rationalist Perspective
## A 						Challenge To Christian Religious Belief 
### 
Bill Evers

In recent years there has been a
widespread growth in evangelical
fundamentalist Christianity among
people in high schools and on college
campuses.
When such Christians speak of the
goodness of God or of their experience
of Jesus in their personal lives, it
makes sense to ask them what they
mean by such statements.
Such Christians, for instance, are
likely to accept literally Jesus' dictum:
"Consider the lilies of the field, how
they grow; they toil not, neither do
they spin. ... Take therefore no
thought for the morrow."
These Christians accept this
doctrine as valid because it is Jesus'
word as recorded in the Bible. That is,
they accept the doctrine on authority.
Yet the doctrine is manifestly

absurd. Human beings are not
constituted like lilies. A human being
must plan ahead in a purposeful
fashion if he is to survive. If this
doctrine of Jesus were accepted
universally and acted on, the human
race would shortly die of starvation.
(Jesus' doctrine is slightly more
plausible if one agrees with those
scholars of religion who think that
Jesus believed that the world would
come to an end before his listeners
died natural deaths.) This scholarly
hypothesis is irrelevant to the
fundamentalists, who stick to Jesus'
literal words.)
Contradictions
To justify the claim that the God of
Christianity exists, however, it is not
satisfactory simply to appeal to
authority (the Bible). There are other
self-proclaimed religious authorities
(like Mohammed and the Koran) that
contradict Christian belief. Instead we
must examine the reasons that have
been advanced for belief in the
Christian God.
First of all, the burden of proof lies
on the person who advances the
hypothesis of God. Entities should not
be multiplied except when necessary.
The theist is adding an explanatory
entity to the universe. All the atheist
has to do is show inadequacies in the
theist's concept of God or in the
evidence for his existence.
Before we can decide whether God
exists, the theists must supply us with
a coherent conception of God. We
must ask, "What do you mean when
you say 'God,' what is this God?"
So far all statements ever made by
theists about God's nature have been
vague and nebulous. No one has ever
provided an intelligible and
non-contradictory definition of God.
To meet this challenge is certainly the
first duty of Christians, yet the
challenge stands still unmet.
Description
In the August 9, 1973 issue of The
Listener, philosopher A.J. Ayer sums
up the Christian description of God:
"Those who believe that there is
just one God are in general agreement
that he is an intelligent person, or
something like one; that he feels
emotions such as love or moral
indignation; that he is incorporeal,
except in the case of the Christian
God, when, for a period of about
thirty years, if one assumes the
identity of the Son and the Father, he
had what are ordinarily supposed to be
the incompatible properties of being
both corporeal and incorporeal; that,
again with this exception, he is not
located in space, though capable of
acting in space; that he is either eternal
or with the same exception not
located in time, though capable of
acting in time; that he created the
world and continues to oversee it; that
he is not subject to change; that he is
all-powerful and all-knowing; that he is
morally perfect and also supremely
benevolent; and that he necessarily
exists."
The Christian account of the nature
of God is hopelessly shot through with
inconsistencies and disharmonies. Ayer
has pointed a few of them out in
describing the Christian position. But
there are many more.
Coherent Concepts?
Can an entity which experiences
emotions be said to be not subject to
change? Is the concept of
omnipotence coherent? (For instance,
can God make a rock bigger than he
can move?) Is the concept of
omniscience coherent? (For instance,
can God invent a puzzle that is more
difficult than he can solve?) Can God
destroy himself? (If he cannot, he is
not omnipotent; if he can, he is not a

necessary being, not eternal, etc.)
In addition, there is a contradiction
between divine predestination and
human free-will. As philosopher
Anthony Flew notes, in the Christian
view, "God should both be the
infinitely powerful Creator, and
possess a will which his creatures can,
and regularly do, disobey. The force of
this question is frequently not felt, not
felt fully, because people either do not
realize or forget the relevant meaning
of Creator.
"To say that the Christian God is
the Creator is to say, not only that he
brought the universe into being out of
nothing, but also that he is the
constant and essential sustaining cause
of everything within it.. . .
"As Creator ... he both designs
and makes [creatures] in full
knowledge and determination of all
that they will ever do or fail to do.. ..
In short: if creation is in, autonomy is
out."
What About 'Evil'?
Lastly, there is the problem of the
existence of evil. As Flew puts it:
'The issue is whether to assert at the
same time first that there is an
infinitely good God, second that he is
an all-powerful Creator, and third that
there are evils in his universe, is to
contradict yourself."
While we can now see that the
Christian concept of God is fraught
with self-contradiction and absurdity
and while it must be emphasized that
an adequate concept is a prerequisite
of any proof of God's existence, there
are some other arguments for God that
should be examined.
First, some argue that the universe
needs an original cause. (One illogical
aspect of this argument is discussed in
a famous passage in the
Autobiography of John Stuart Mill.
Mill notes that the hypothesis of God
"only throws the difficulty a step
further back, since the question
immediately presents itself 'Who
made God?' ")
By recognizing that the law of
identity is the presupposition of all
understanding of causality, Nathaniel
Branden pinpoints the fundamental
fallacy in the argument from the need
for a first cause: It is "the assumption
that the universe as a whole requires a
causal explanation. It does not.
Causality
"The universe is the total of that
which exists. Within the universe, the
emergence of new entities can be
explained in terms of the action of
entities that already exist: the cause of
a tree is the seed of the parent tree;
the cause of a machine is the
purposeful reshaping of matter by
men.. ..
"All causality presupposes the
existence of something that acts as a
cause. To demand a cause for all of
existence is to demand a
contradiction: if the cause exists, it is
part of existence; if it does not exist, it
cannot be a cause. ... Causality
presupposes existence, existence does

not presuppose causality."
Second, some people argue for the
existence of God from the orderly
nature of the universe. This argument
from design not only runs immediately
into the problem of where the designer
got his ideas or who designed the
designer, but also it violates the rule of
parsimony that entities should not be
multiplied, without necessity. Is it not
simpler to maintain that order and
regularity are natural to the entities
composing the universe?
Conflictions
Third, some people argue for the
existence of God on the basis of direct
mystical revelation. For us as
observers, this presents a problem
because the claims of mystics conflict
(much as the authoritative Bible
conflicts with the authoritative
Koran).
But the mystic himself faces an
even worse problem. Suppose a person
believes, for example, that God is
speaking to him, what standards can
he apply to ascertain whether it really
is God speaking or whether it is an
illusion, the Devil, etc.?
The person who argues from
revelation must answer the question
posed by Thomas Hobbes in
Leviathan: "If a man pretend to me
that God hath spoken to him
supernaturally and immediately, and I
make doubt of it, I cannot easily
perceive what argument he can
produce to oblige me to believe it. ...
No Way To Check
"To say he hath spoken to him in a
dream is no more than to say that he
dreamed that God spoke to him.*' Why
should we believe a human being's
account of revelation? As a human he
could have made a mistake or be lying,
and there is no way to check.
Lastly, some people argue for the
existence of God because they believe
that miracles have happened. Yet if
you accept the idea that miracles (like
the resurrection of Jesus) happened,
you reject the possibility of a history
that gives us knowledge about the
past. Part of what David Hume is
arguing in his essay on miracles in his
Inquiry Concerning Human
Understanding is that historical
research is the assembling of evidence
within the boundaries of the known
rules of causality. But if into a
universe of natural facts like the law of
gravity, one introduces miracles (by
definition, violations of natural law,
supernatural events), then the
conceptual possibility of history
vanishes â€” because the natural
principles of causality have vanished.
Upon examination we have seen
that the Christian theist's concept of
God is incoherent and that various
arguments advanced for the existence
of God do not make sense. The claim
that God exists has never been
justified, and the case for theism
stands refuted by critical reason.
