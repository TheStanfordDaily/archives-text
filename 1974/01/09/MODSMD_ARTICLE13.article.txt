# Film Adaptation Of Bestseller
## 'Seagull' Not Entirely For The Birds 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
Everyone has seen Jonathan
Livingston Seagull, whether in
paperback or on film, or at least
in their own subconscious. This is
perhaps because the controversial
bird liv?s within us all.
The recently released film
version of Richard Bach's
bestseller attempts to recreate the
philosophies expounded by
Jonathan Seagull. James
Fransiscus verbalizes Jonathan's
thoughts and ideals in a detracting
and irritating style. But this
annoyance by no means upsets
the impact of the film. It just

affects the understanding of what
Jonathan says, because often the
voice is whispering and muffled.
Considering the obstacles Hal
Bartlett had to overcome in
producing such an intangible
story, thematically developing
around freedom and flight, the
results are impressive.
Visually J.L.S. creates a
dynamic and flowing view of the
sky and the ocean, offset by such
panoramic sights as Yosemite
Valley, the sand dunes in the
Sahara, and the snowy
timberlands of the north. We
follow the flight and plight of

Jonathan across all of these
territories, in his endeavors to
improve his flying ability and
ultimately reach perfection.
Believability lies within our
own conceptions of the story's
expression, which makes it
vulnerable to criticism.
The story may be a little too
melodramatic or idealistic for
some cynical moviegoers. If that is
the case, than certainly there are
at least two major redeeming
factors to eliminate anyone's
apprehensions.
First, there is the
cinematography. This film is

exceptionally good in terms of
aesthetics. The use of a creative
color range in establishing the
essence of "heaven," plus the
skillful efforts of acrobatic flyers
in catching intricate and unusual
angles of the ocean waves,
shoreline, and rocky coasts from
the air, enhances the composition
of the story.
Wide Talent Search
Six thousand seagulls were
photographed and "interviewed"
before discovering three with
superior potential for the lead
role. Visually, this effort was
worthwhile, maintaining the
realism which is critical to the
film's acceptance.
The soundtrack of Jomthan
Livingston Seagull is another
strength. Originated by the
extraordinarily talented recording
artist, Neil Diamond, the music is
not merely a background. It
provides an ever-changing canvas
on which the visual illumination
of Richard Bach's metaphysical
reflections are displayed.
Diamond succeeds in achieving
that which Jonathan ultimately
strives for: "to fly straight up and
know the meaning of kindness
and love."

Livingston Seagull is another
strength. Originated by the
extraordinarily talented recording
artist, Neil Diamond, the music is
not merely a background. It
provides an ever-changing canvas
on which the visual illumination
of Richard Bach's metaphysical
reflections are displayed.
Diamond succeeds in achieving
that which Jonathan ultimately
strives for: "to fly straight up and
know the meaning of kindness
and love."
Everyone has seen Jonathan
Livingston Seagull, whether in
paperback or on film, or at least
in their own subconscious. This is
perhaps because the controversial
bird liv?s within us all.
The recently released film
version of Richard Bach's
bestseller attempts to recreate the
philosophies expounded by
Jonathan Seagull. James
Fransiscus verbalizes Jonathan's
thoughts and ideals in a detracting
and irritating style. But this
annoyance by no means upsets
the impact of the film. It just

affects the understanding of what
Jonathan says, because often the
voice is whispering and muffled.
Considering the obstacles Hal
Bartlett had to overcome in
producing such an intangible
story, thematically developing
around freedom and flight, the
results are impressive.
Visually J.L.S. creates a
dynamic and flowing view of the
sky and the ocean, offset by such
panoramic sights as Yosemite
Valley, the sand dunes in the
Sahara, and the snowy
timberlands of the north. We
follow the flight and plight of

Jonathan across all of these
territories, in his endeavors to
improve his flying ability and
ultimately reach perfection.
Believability lies within our
own conceptions of the story's
expression, which makes it
vulnerable to criticism.
The story may be a little too
melodramatic or idealistic for
some cynical moviegoers. If that is
the case, than certainly there are
at least two major redeeming
factors to eliminate anyone's
apprehensions.
First, there is the
cinematography. This film is

exceptionally good in terms of
aesthetics. The use of a creative
color range in establishing the
essence of "heaven," plus the
skillful efforts of acrobatic flyers
in catching intricate and unusual
angles of the ocean waves,
shoreline, and rocky coasts from
the air, enhances the composition
of the story.
Wide Talent Search
Six thousand seagulls were
photographed and "interviewed"
before discovering three with
superior potential for the lead
role. Visually, this effort was
worthwhile, maintaining the
realism which is critical to the
film's acceptance.

Livingston Seagull is another
