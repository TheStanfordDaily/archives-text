# Carmen McRae Helps To Keep Fine Art Of Jazz Singing Alive
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
SAN FRANCISCO—There are
very few true jazz singers around
today. Some singers in the
popular category border on jazz
because their back-up ground
plays jazz or consists of jazz
musicians. Carmen Mcßae ranks
alongside Ella Fitzgerald as one of
the handful of female jazz singers .
and yet to many she is only a
name.
The mere appearance of Mcßae
at the Great American Music Hall
December 7 elicitied a standing
ovation from the packed room.
She was over half an hour late but
the circumstances of her tardiness
satisfied a restless audience. San
Francisco was fogged in, so she
had to land in San Jose and drive
up from there.
What sets Mcßae apart from
other singers is her ability to
inject humor into a song —
through phrasing, stretching her
range, or a gesture. As she sang
her way through such tunes as
"Linger Awhile," "Them There
Eyes," "Green Dolphin Street,"
and "Younger than Spring," it
was evident that she was
comfortable and could ably
handle ballads as well as up-tempo
numbers. She is an unpretentious
entertainer whose warm and
confiding manner makes you feel
as though you've been friends for
a long time.
The skeletal accompaniment of
Tom Garvin on piano, Joe
Dißartolo on bass and Peter
Donald on drums is all that is
needed to follow her tempo
breaks and slidings up and down
the scale. Mcßae doesn't have a
prearranged act, but that doesn't
mean the performance is loose. It
seems she does the songs that she
feels like doing, which can vary on
any given occasion, and is very
intense, precise and original in her
approach to a song. She obviously
has a huge repertoire and is
capable of freshening up an old
number instantly.
For a few moments, Mcßae sat
down at the piano, a notion which

was unplanned and inspired by
the audieqjce, who pleased her
with its enthusiasm and persuaded
her to deviate from her original
intention. She presented one of
her own compositions as well as a
few others to the delight of her
listeners. She performed some scat
singing comparable to Ella's on

the last number, "No More
Blues," which was composed by
Antonio Carlos Jobim with words
by Jon Hendricks.
Carmen Mcßae deserved the
standing ovation that the capacity
crowd, ripe for her engagement
and rapturously appreciative of
her performance, awarded her.

her own compositions as well as a
few others to the delight of her
listeners. She performed some scat
singing comparable to Ella's on

the last number, "No More
Blues," which was composed by
Antonio Carlos Jobim with words
by Jon Hendricks.
Carmen Mcßae deserved the
standing ovation that the capacity
crowd, ripe for her engagement
and rapturously appreciative of
her performance, awarded her.
SAN FRANCISCO—There are
very few true jazz singers around
today. Some singers in the
popular category border on jazz
because their back-up ground
plays jazz or consists of jazz
musicians. Carmen Mcßae ranks
alongside Ella Fitzgerald as one of
the handful of female jazz singers .
and yet to many she is only a
name.
The mere appearance of Mcßae
at the Great American Music Hall
December 7 elicitied a standing
ovation from the packed room.
She was over half an hour late but
the circumstances of her tardiness
satisfied a restless audience. San
Francisco was fogged in, so she
had to land in San Jose and drive
up from there.
What sets Mcßae apart from
other singers is her ability to
inject humor into a song —
through phrasing, stretching her
range, or a gesture. As she sang
her way through such tunes as
"Linger Awhile," "Them There
Eyes," "Green Dolphin Street,"
and "Younger than Spring," it
was evident that she was
comfortable and could ably
handle ballads as well as up-tempo
numbers. She is an unpretentious
entertainer whose warm and
confiding manner makes you feel
as though you've been friends for
a long time.
The skeletal accompaniment of
Tom Garvin on piano, Joe
Dißartolo on bass and Peter
Donald on drums is all that is
needed to follow her tempo
breaks and slidings up and down
the scale. Mcßae doesn't have a
prearranged act, but that doesn't
mean the performance is loose. It
seems she does the songs that she
feels like doing, which can vary on
any given occasion, and is very
intense, precise and original in her
approach to a song. She obviously
has a huge repertoire and is
capable of freshening up an old
number instantly.
For a few moments, Mcßae sat
down at the piano, a notion which

was unplanned and inspired by
the audieqjce, who pleased her
with its enthusiasm and persuaded
her to deviate from her original
intention. She presented one of
her own compositions as well as a
few others to the delight of her
listeners. She performed some scat
singing comparable to Ella's on
