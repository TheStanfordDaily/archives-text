### 
"Dolls and Puppets from
Five Continents," an
exhibition of rare and antique
dolls and puppets from Asia,
Africa, Europe and America, is
on view at the Stanford
University Museum of Art
through January 13.
Illustrating the cultural and
artistic diversity of dolls, and
their function as objects of
magic ritual, of ceremony and
cult, as well as play, the
exhibits range from gorgeously
robed dolls representing
Japanese emperors and their
court to primitive fetishes of
barely human form. Included
in the exhibition are elaborate
shadow puppets from Java,
wood-carved Ashanti fertility
dolls from Ghana, a Brazilian
voodoo doll, a Pre-Columbian
doll from a Peruvian grave, and
fashionably dressed and coiffed
dolls of 19th century European
and American origin.
Grouped by cultures, the
dolls and puppets give an
insight into the artistic
traditions and the folkways of
the various civilizations which
they represent.
