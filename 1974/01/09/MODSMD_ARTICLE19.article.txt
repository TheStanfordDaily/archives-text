# Patterson Faces Past Pressures As Cards Prepare For L.A. Trip
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Tim Patterson has come a long
way since spending two
benchwarming seasons as a
sophomore and junior at Santa
Maria High School.
But Saturday afternoon at
Pauley Pavilion, 12,000 fans will
be expecting him to advance even
further — to live up to the
standards set by his older brother
Steve.
Two of the nine championship
banners that hang übiquitously
from Pauley's rafters belong at
least in part to the elder
Patterson. Steve started for the
Bruins of 1969-70 and 1970-71
and after his 29-point outburst in
the 1971 NCAA finals, his picture
adorned the cover of Sports
Illustrated.
But those were the glory days
for Steve Patterson. Now he is a
seldom-starting center for the
sorrowful Cleveland Cavaliers of
the NBA. And Tim, who used to
be "a super UCLA fan" and
basked in his brother's glory, will
travel south this weekend as a
Stanford Cardinal — a member of
a team that has so far failed to live
up to preseason expectations and
is currently as downtrodden as
Steve's Cavaliers.
"We have to stop being so
lackadaisacal — stop taking
everything for granted," Tim said.
"When you look at our record
[5-5) and our opponents, you
realize that we've played poorly.
But when you look at our
personnel, you see that we're not
that bad. We're just not playingup
to our capabilities."
Struggling
Stanford is now 0-2 in the
Pacific Eight. The Cards are
struggling, and at least one victory

over the weekend is crucial if
Stanford is to challenge for
second place in the conference.
There will be considerable
pressure in Los Angeles —
especially for Patterson.
"There were a lot of times in
high school when I felt I was
forced to play basketball because
I was so tall and because I was
Steve Patterson's brother," says
Tim, who played on the JVs as a
sophomore and languished on the
varsity bench as a junior. "It was
unbelievable — Steve was such a
local hero that it was hard being
his little brother."
Tim was already 6-8 as a junior
(he now stands a shade under
seven feet), but his talent
remained untapped. "I never
made a conscious decision to play
until my senior year," he said. "I
was never playing for myself until
then — I was just playing to fulfill
other peoples' expectations."
Even as Tim blossomed into a
legitimate star as a senior (23
points, 14 rebounds a game), the
pressure remained. One newspaper
ran a huge picture of Tim with a
basketball poised on his fingertips.
The caption — in headline-size
print — was "Steve's little
brother."
Escaped From Shadows
Now Tim is a Stanford
sophomore. He has escaped from
his brother's shadow and has
established a reputation of his
own — a reputation hardly
enhanced by disappointing
individual and team performances
last weekend, but a solid
reputation nonetheless.
This year he ranks fourth on
the Stanford scoring charts with a
9.0 per game average, and he
currently trails only Rich Kelley
on the rebounding list. Last year
as a freshman he averaged six
points a game coming off the

bench, and displayed flashes of
brilliance, like a 10-10 shooting
performance against UC-Santa
Barabara and a solid 12-point
effort against UCLA.
He shoots with an
uncommonly feathery touch for a
big man, often scoring from
beyond 20 feet. "I've always been
a good shooter," Patterson says.
But when asked abut his
weaknesses, he covered his mouth,
his face turned red and he blurted
out in barely audible tones,
"Rebounding and defense."
Stand Around
"I never played a lick of
defense in my life before last
year," he admits. "We played a
zone in high school and all I did
was stand around.
"But I think I've improved
considerably," he says, a thought
shared by his coaches and
teammates. "I've concentrated on
defense and rebounding more.
Last year I showed myself I was
capable of scoring in major college
basketball, but I realized I was far
from a complete player. It was
mainly a matter of adjusting to a
higher quality of basketball."
This weekend, the quality will
be very high, as it always is at the
Sports Arena and at Pauley
Pavilion, "If we can just put
together a game with a minimal
amount of turnovers, shoot a
good percentage, outrebound the
opposition — if we could just put
together a game like that I'd be
satisfied. And I think we could
win — even against UCLA."
But Patterson disregards any
personal weekend goals, even
though he'll be playing against
those amazing Bruins at that
awe-inspiring Pavilion. "I'm not
the kind that dreams about
scoring 20 at Pauley," he says."I
just want to go out there and
play."

FOINTS AT PAULEY—Tim Patterson (55) lofts a jump shot last year against UCLA as Larry Hollyfield
(53), Keith Wilkes (52) and Bill Walton look on. Patterson, whose brother Steve starred on two of the
Bruin national championship teams, will return to Pauley Pavilion Saturday afternoon when the Cards
meet the 1974 Bruins. Friday night Stanford visits USC at the L.A. Sports Arena.
Tim Patterson has come a long
way since spending two
benchwarming seasons as a
sophomore and junior at Santa
Maria High School.
But Saturday afternoon at
Pauley Pavilion, 12,000 fans will
be expecting him to advance even
further — to live up to the
standards set by his older brother
Steve.
Two of the nine championship
banners that hang übiquitously
from Pauley's rafters belong at
least in part to the elder
Patterson. Steve started for the
Bruins of 1969-70 and 1970-71
and after his 29-point outburst in
the 1971 NCAA finals, his picture
adorned the cover of Sports
Illustrated.
But those were the glory days
for Steve Patterson. Now he is a
seldom-starting center for the
sorrowful Cleveland Cavaliers of
the NBA. And Tim, who used to
be "a super UCLA fan" and
basked in his brother's glory, will
travel south this weekend as a
Stanford Cardinal — a member of
a team that has so far failed to live
up to preseason expectations and
is currently as downtrodden as
Steve's Cavaliers.
"We have to stop being so
lackadaisacal — stop taking
everything for granted," Tim said.
"When you look at our record
[5-5) and our opponents, you
realize that we've played poorly.
But when you look at our
personnel, you see that we're not
that bad. We're just not playingup
to our capabilities."
Struggling
Stanford is now 0-2 in the
Pacific Eight. The Cards are
struggling, and at least one victory

over the weekend is crucial if
Stanford is to challenge for
second place in the conference.
There will be considerable
pressure in Los Angeles —
especially for Patterson.
"There were a lot of times in
high school when I felt I was
forced to play basketball because
I was so tall and because I was
Steve Patterson's brother," says
Tim, who played on the JVs as a
sophomore and languished on the
varsity bench as a junior. "It was
unbelievable — Steve was such a
local hero that it was hard being
his little brother."
Tim was already 6-8 as a junior
(he now stands a shade under
seven feet), but his talent
remained untapped. "I never
made a conscious decision to play
until my senior year," he said. "I
was never playing for myself until
then — I was just playing to fulfill
other peoples' expectations."
Even as Tim blossomed into a
legitimate star as a senior (23
points, 14 rebounds a game), the
pressure remained. One newspaper
ran a huge picture of Tim with a
basketball poised on his fingertips.
The caption — in headline-size
print — was "Steve's little
brother."
Escaped From Shadows
Now Tim is a Stanford
sophomore. He has escaped from
his brother's shadow and has
established a reputation of his
own — a reputation hardly
enhanced by disappointing
individual and team performances
last weekend, but a solid
reputation nonetheless.
This year he ranks fourth on
the Stanford scoring charts with a
9.0 per game average, and he
currently trails only Rich Kelley
on the rebounding list. Last year
as a freshman he averaged six
points a game coming off the

bench, and displayed flashes of
brilliance, like a 10-10 shooting
performance against UC-Santa
Barabara and a solid 12-point
effort against UCLA.
He shoots with an
uncommonly feathery touch for a
big man, often scoring from
beyond 20 feet. "I've always been
a good shooter," Patterson says.
But when asked abut his
weaknesses, he covered his mouth,
his face turned red and he blurted
out in barely audible tones,
"Rebounding and defense."
Stand Around
"I never played a lick of
defense in my life before last
year," he admits. "We played a
zone in high school and all I did
was stand around.
"But I think I've improved
considerably," he says, a thought
shared by his coaches and
teammates. "I've concentrated on
defense and rebounding more.
Last year I showed myself I was
capable of scoring in major college
basketball, but I realized I was far

sophomore. He has escaped from
his brother's shadow and has
established a reputation of his
own — a reputation hardly
enhanced by disappointing
individual and team performances
last weekend, but a solid
reputation nonetheless.
This year he ranks fourth on
the Stanford scoring charts with a
9.0 per game average, and he
currently trails only Rich Kelley
on the rebounding list. Last year
as a freshman he averaged six
points a game coming off the

bench, and displayed flashes of
brilliance, like a 10-10 shooting
performance against UC-Santa
Barabara and a solid 12-point
effort against UCLA.
He shoots with an
uncommonly feathery touch for a
big man, often scoring from
beyond 20 feet. "I've always been
a good shooter," Patterson says.
But when asked abut his
weaknesses, he covered his mouth,
his face turned red and he blurted
out in barely audible tones,
"Rebounding and defense."
Stand Around
"I never played a lick of
defense in my life before last
year," he admits. "We played a
zone in high school and all I did
was stand around.
"But I think I've improved
considerably," he says, a thought
shared by his coaches and
teammates. "I've concentrated on
defense and rebounding more.
Last year I showed myself I was
capable of scoring in major college
basketball, but I realized I was far
from a complete player. It was
mainly a matter of adjusting to a
higher quality of basketball."
This weekend, the quality will
be very high, as it always is at the
Sports Arena and at Pauley
Pavilion, "If we can just put
together a game with a minimal
amount of turnovers, shoot a
good percentage, outrebound the
opposition — if we could just put
together a game like that I'd be
satisfied. And I think we could
win — even against UCLA."
But Patterson disregards any
personal weekend goals, even
though he'll be playing against
those amazing Bruins at that
awe-inspiring Pavilion. "I'm not
the kind that dreams about
scoring 20 at Pauley," he says."I
just want to go out there and
play."

FOINTS AT PAULEY—Tim Patterson (55) lofts a jump shot last year against UCLA as Larry Hollyfield
(53), Keith Wilkes (52) and Bill Walton look on. Patterson, whose brother Steve starred on two of the
Bruin national championship teams, will return to Pauley Pavilion Saturday afternoon when the Cards
meet the 1974 Bruins. Friday night Stanford visits USC at the L.A. Sports Arena.
Tim Patterson has come a long
way since spending two
benchwarming seasons as a
sophomore and junior at Santa
Maria High School.
But Saturday afternoon at
Pauley Pavilion, 12,000 fans will
be expecting him to advance even
further — to live up to the
standards set by his older brother
Steve.
Two of the nine championship
banners that hang übiquitously
from Pauley's rafters belong at
least in part to the elder
Patterson. Steve started for the
Bruins of 1969-70 and 1970-71
and after his 29-point outburst in
the 1971 NCAA finals, his picture
adorned the cover of Sports
Illustrated.
But those were the glory days
for Steve Patterson. Now he is a
seldom-starting center for the
sorrowful Cleveland Cavaliers of
the NBA. And Tim, who used to
be "a super UCLA fan" and
basked in his brother's glory, will
travel south this weekend as a
Stanford Cardinal — a member of
a team that has so far failed to live
up to preseason expectations and
is currently as downtrodden as
Steve's Cavaliers.
"We have to stop being so
lackadaisacal — stop taking
everything for granted," Tim said.
"When you look at our record
[5-5) and our opponents, you
realize that we've played poorly.
But when you look at our
personnel, you see that we're not
that bad. We're just not playingup
to our capabilities."
Struggling
Stanford is now 0-2 in the
Pacific Eight. The Cards are
struggling, and at least one victory

over the weekend is crucial if
Stanford is to challenge for
second place in the conference.
There will be considerable
pressure in Los Angeles —
especially for Patterson.
"There were a lot of times in
high school when I felt I was
forced to play basketball because
I was so tall and because I was
Steve Patterson's brother," says
Tim, who played on the JVs as a
sophomore and languished on the
varsity bench as a junior. "It was
unbelievable — Steve was such a
local hero that it was hard being
his little brother."
Tim was already 6-8 as a junior
(he now stands a shade under
seven feet), but his talent
remained untapped. "I never
made a conscious decision to play
until my senior year," he said. "I
was never playing for myself until
then — I was just playing to fulfill
other peoples' expectations."
Even as Tim blossomed into a
legitimate star as a senior (23
points, 14 rebounds a game), the
pressure remained. One newspaper
ran a huge picture of Tim with a
basketball poised on his fingertips.
The caption — in headline-size
print — was "Steve's little
brother."
