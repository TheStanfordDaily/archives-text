# Lyman Would Favor Modified ROTC Plan

### MARK SIMONIAN 
President Richard Lyman last night
said he would support a modified form
of ROTC on campus if student interest
in the program were sufficient.
Speaking on KZSU's "Campus
Conference," Lyman said he favors an
ROTC program in which the
University could be "both the
generator and teacher of courses.
"I would support a good vehicle by
which students can undergo armed
forces training, the military parts of
which are off campus, providing the
impact on this institution are not
adverse," he said.
Senate Meets Thursday
The Faculty Senate will consider
whether to reopen the controversial
debate over on-campus ROTC
programs Thursday in its first meeting
of the quarter. The Senate voted to
phase out the ROTC program in 1970.
Lyman said his principal objections
to ROTC centered around the issues of
academic credit, "quasi-faculty" status
of military personnel and punitive
clauses in ROTC students' financial aid
contracts.
He advocated a "system in which
the control in credit is firmly vested in
the University" and said he could not
endorse "courses designed by the
Pentagon and taught by its
employees," with the University
limited to veto power over these
courses.
Stanford faculty must be
responsible for the planning and
teaching of classes under an acceptable
ROTC plan, he said.

Lyman lashed out at the military
for imposing immediate induction as
the penalty for any student who chose
to drop out of previous ROTC
programs.
"I think it's highly desirable to have
the system converted to a forgivable
loan" where if the student finished his
training, the government would
"forget" his expenses. If a student
chose to drop out of ROTC, the
government could then require him to
pay his loan back, Lyman explained.
Lyman cautioned that even if the
faculty were to endorse reinstatement
of ROTC whole-heartedly, the military
may be unwilling to return here or
