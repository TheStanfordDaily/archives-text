# Lyman Would Favor Modified ROTC Plan
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
President Richard Lyman last night
said he would support a modified form
of ROTC on campus if student interest
in the program were sufficient.
Speaking on KZSU's "Campus
Conference," Lyman said he favors an
ROTC program in which the
University could be "both the
generator and teacher of courses.
"I would support a good vehicle by
which students can undergo armed
forces training, the military parts of
which are off campus, providing the
impact on this institution are not
adverse," he said.
Senate Meets Thursday
The Faculty Senate will consider
whether to reopen the controversial
debate over on-campus ROTC
programs Thursday in its first meeting
of the quarter. The Senate voted to
phase out the ROTC program in 1970.
Lyman said his principal objections
to ROTC centered around the issues of
academic credit, "quasi-faculty" status
of military personnel and punitive
clauses in ROTC students' financial aid
contracts.
He advocated a "system in which
the control in credit is firmly vested in
the University" and said he could not
endorse "courses designed by the
Pentagon and taught by its
employees," with the University
limited to veto power over these
courses.
Stanford faculty must be
responsible for the planning and
teaching of classes under an acceptable
ROTC plan, he said.

Lyman lashed out at the military
for imposing immediate induction as
the penalty for any student who chose
to drop out of previous ROTC
programs.
"I think it's highly desirable to have
the system converted to a forgivable
loan" where if the student finished his
training, the government would
"forget" his expenses. If a student
chose to drop out of ROTC, the
government could then require him to
pay his loan back, Lyman explained.
Lyman cautioned that even if the
faculty were to endorse reinstatement
of ROTC whole-heartedly, the military
may be unwilling to return here or


PRESIDENT LYMAN
may ask the University to "wait its
turn" in favor of other colleges which
have not phased ROTC out.
'Very Preliminary'
He noted that the Faculty Senate's
discussion Thursday will be "very
preliminary" and that "there may not
even be a great likelihood of ROTC
succeeding here."
"There's no point in arguing
ROTC" without first considering "the
question of student interest." Only
150 students signed a petition asking
the Faculty Senate to reconsider
ROTC, 350 short of the required
number, he added.
Chicano Adviser
Turning to other matters, Lyman
said it would probably take "a period
of several months" before he names a
new assistant for chicano affairs.

Salvador Sanchez, Lyman's former
chicano adviser, was promoted last
quarter to special assistant to the
president.
Lyman said his search committee
empowered to select a new chicano
adviser has just begun preliminary
work. He commented that the interim
"executive committee of concerned
chicanos" is working reasonably well.
Lyman also backed the Athletic
Department in asking KZSU to refrain
from broadcasting varsity basketball
games over FM. The University's
exclusive contract with KSFO is "not
being honored as long as KZSU
broadcasts over FM," he said.
He suggested that the campus radio
station continue presenting basketball
coverage "over its AM cable to the
dorms" to capture the only "original"
campus audience.

may ask the University to "wait its
turn" in favor of other colleges which
have not phased ROTC out.
'Very Preliminary'
He noted that the Faculty Senate's
discussion Thursday will be "very
preliminary" and that "there may not
even be a great likelihood of ROTC
succeeding here."
"There's no point in arguing
ROTC" without first considering "the
question of student interest." Only
150 students signed a petition asking
the Faculty Senate to reconsider
ROTC, 350 short of the required
number, he added.
Chicano Adviser
Turning to other matters, Lyman
said it would probably take "a period
of several months" before he names a
new assistant for chicano affairs.

Salvador Sanchez, Lyman's former
chicano adviser, was promoted last
quarter to special assistant to the
president.
Lyman said his search committee
empowered to select a new chicano
adviser has just begun preliminary
work. He commented that the interim
"executive committee of concerned
chicanos" is working reasonably well.
Lyman also backed the Athletic
Department in asking KZSU to refrain
from broadcasting varsity basketball
games over FM. The University's
exclusive contract with KSFO is "not
being honored as long as KZSU
broadcasts over FM," he said.
He suggested that the campus radio
station continue presenting basketball
coverage "over its AM cable to the
dorms" to capture the only "original"
campus audience.
President Richard Lyman last night
said he would support a modified form
of ROTC on campus if student interest
in the program were sufficient.
Speaking on KZSU's "Campus
Conference," Lyman said he favors an
ROTC program in which the
University could be "both the
generator and teacher of courses.
"I would support a good vehicle by
which students can undergo armed
forces training, the military parts of
which are off campus, providing the
impact on this institution are not
adverse," he said.
Senate Meets Thursday
The Faculty Senate will consider
whether to reopen the controversial
debate over on-campus ROTC
programs Thursday in its first meeting
of the quarter. The Senate voted to
phase out the ROTC program in 1970.
Lyman said his principal objections
to ROTC centered around the issues of
academic credit, "quasi-faculty" status
of military personnel and punitive
clauses in ROTC students' financial aid
contracts.
He advocated a "system in which
the control in credit is firmly vested in
the University" and said he could not
endorse "courses designed by the
Pentagon and taught by its
employees," with the University
limited to veto power over these
courses.
Stanford faculty must be
responsible for the planning and
teaching of classes under an acceptable
ROTC plan, he said.

Lyman lashed out at the military
for imposing immediate induction as
the penalty for any student who chose
to drop out of previous ROTC
programs.
"I think it's highly desirable to have
the system converted to a forgivable
loan" where if the student finished his
training, the government would
"forget" his expenses. If a student
chose to drop out of ROTC, the
government could then require him to
pay his loan back, Lyman explained.
Lyman cautioned that even if the
faculty were to endorse reinstatement
of ROTC whole-heartedly, the military
may be unwilling to return here or
