# Dallmar Jr. Tests Card JV
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Few would be surprised to
know that Howie Dallmar will be
on the Maples Pavilion floor
tomorrow night. But this Dallmar
won't be the man who has
coached Stanford basketball for
20 years — it will be his son
Howie, a sophomore forward for
Menlo College, the Stanford's
junior varsity opponent at 7 p.m.
One Bay Area basketball
observer says the 6-6 junior
Dallmar "is a real bruiser, but he
has finesse. He plays like
[Stanford varsity forward] Dave
Frost."
JV head man Billy Jones
describes both the Menlo team
and its coach, Bud Presley, as
"excellent." Jones says his team
will have to "run and work like
hell" to stay in the game with
Menlo, which won the state junior
college championship for small
schools last year.
Jones, however, will
accompany the Stanford varsity
contigent to Los Angeles this
weekend, so assistant Bob Buell
will direct the JV, as he did
Saturday night when it beat
Cuesta, 73-66.
The JV's, now 2-2, have "not
had any consistency" so far this
season, Jones says, but he hopes
that with a full quota of practices
this week, instead of just two
sessions like last week, the young
Cards will be "a lot more
consistent."
"We have not shot as well as
we can," he says, refusing to
single out any particular players.
"They all can shoot better than
they have been."
