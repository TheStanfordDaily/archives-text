# No Major Changes For Card Cagers
## 
### 
There won't be a major overhaul, but Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar plans a minor tuneup in
preparation for this weekend's games in Los Angeles
against USC and UCLA.
"There won't be any big changes," Dallmar said
yesterday. "We're just going to work hard this week,
and hopefully learn to relax a little and just play the
game." At this point, Dallmar plans no lineup
changes.
The team is working against pressure defenses,
hoping to alleviate its troublesome turnover
problems (22.9 a game) and, according to Dallmar,
"working Mike Mann back into things." Mann,
sidelined most of the season with a variety of knee
problems, should be close to 100 percent for this

weekend's games.
Dallmar also emphasized that Rich Kelley was
"shaken up" by a bad fall in Friday's loss to
Oregon, "and I'm sure he was not feeling his best
Saturday night [against Oregon State]," when he
converted only 2-16 field goal attempts.
Last year against UCLA, however, Kelley played
All-American Bill Walton to a virtual standoff,
outrebounding the big redhead 15-10 while losing
the scoring battle 23-15.
Friday night's USC game begins at 8 p.m. at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena. Saturday's
Stanford-UCLA tipoff, which will be televised
regionally (Channel 2 in the Bay Area) is scheduled
for 3 p.m.
