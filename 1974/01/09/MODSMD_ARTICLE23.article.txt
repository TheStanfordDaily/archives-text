# Walton OK

UCLA center Bill Walton sat
out the final 10 minutes of
Monday night's 55-45 victory over
Washington with a sore back, but
doctors said yesterday the
two-time All-American would be
ready for this weekend's games
against California and Stanford.
Walton, who scored 12 points
in the surprisingly tough victory
over the Cougars, has some
bruised back muscles. He did not,
as originally diagnosed, "crack a
process long, projecting point on
the vertabra just below the back
of his rib cage."
In other Monday games, USC
rolled past Washington, 90-76,
and California lost a non-league
game to Rice, 76-75 in overtime.
