# Horpel Out For Season
## SJS Trims Wrestlers 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
San Jose State's wrestling team
trimmed Stanford last night,
23-17, before a noisy crowd at
Encina Gym. One of the voices in
the crowd was that of Chris
Horpel, a pre-season Ail-American
candidate, who is out for the
season because of damaged
ligaments.
Horpel and Ken Krebs, another
top wrestler who is injured, would
have made the difference, said
Coach Joe De Meo, but the Cards
almost staged an amazing
comeback victory, without two of
their team captains.
Trailing 15-0 after three
matches because of a 7-2 loss and

two forfeits, Mark Yancey (142)
turned in an exciting 21-19
come-from-behind win. Yancey
led 5-3 after the first period, but
had a disastrous second round
which put him behind 15-8.
Round three belonged entirely
to the Stanford freshman. After
giving up another point on an
escape, he scored three
takedowns, two near-pins and an
escape while holding his opponent
to four points.
Charlie Marsh (150), another
freshman, provided the Card's
biggest win by pinning his foe
early in the second round.
Emmett Stanton (158) continued
Stanford's momentum, building
up a 4-0 lead and holding on for a
6-2 decision. That narrowed San
Jose's margin to three.
Stanford's Jeff Richardson
(167) tangled with Jim Kinsaken,
resulting in a 1-1 draw, but Marc
Frelier (177) was beaten 7-4, and
San Jose led by six.
Roy Tolles kept the Cards in
the meet by dominating his
opponent, 11-3, but Gary
Anderson (Hwy) lost to Donnel
Jackson to conclude the meet.
Horpel and Krebs weren't the
only interested wrestlers who
watched the meet from the
sidelines. The Cornell University
team, one of the Card's opponents
along with UCLA on Saturday,
scouted the match.
