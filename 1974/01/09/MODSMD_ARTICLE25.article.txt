# Pro Prognosis
## Super Bowl: 'On Any Given Day...' 
### Don Tollefson 
Forget Watergate. Forget the energy crisis.
Forget the Middle East. For many Americans,
this is the week to turn undivided attentions
towards Houston â€” and its not because of
NASA.
For the eighth year in a row, the
champions of the American and National
Football Conferences will clash this Sunday
for the distinction of being the finest football
team on this planet, at least.
But who knows what Sunday will bring.
Maybe Garo Yepremian will try to throw
another pass. Maybe ex-Stanford star Jeff
Siemon, who has matured into a genuine
all-star middle linebacker, will be more
successful at stopping the Dolphin ground
game than his Oakland counterpart Dan
Connors was. Maybe Comet Kohoutek will
simultaneously fall on Don Shula and Bob
Griese.
Regardless of what happens on the
scoreboard, there are some things which will
certainly occur this weekend. Most
importantly, a mercilessly long football season
will virtually come to a close Sunday
afternoon. Only the boredom of the Pro Bowl
will stand between millions of American
households and weekend tranquility.
But weekday tranquility will probably be
at least another few weeks off as millions of
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday morning quarterbacks will replay every
facet of the game except Joe Namath's
Noxzema commercial for a number of weeks.
Worst of all will be the idle chatter of that
lowest of all sports world creatures, the hack
sportswriter. As sure as the sun will rise next
Monday morning, you can bet the hacks will
waste tons of newsprint subjecting countless
readers to worthless tripe. Four types of

totally inane stories are sure to be written.
First off, some writer for the Franco Harris
Falls, Pennsylvania Sun-Telegram will claim
that the two best teams weren't in the Super
Bowl. He will claim that the Steelers were
actually better than the Dolphins, but that
they were beaten by the Oakland Coliseum
field.
He will methodically describe how the
Steelers would have narrowly but surely
beaten Miami had it not been for Oakland's
mud. He will propose that every NFL team be
required to build a $500 million domed
stadium to prevent the "scandalous
conditions" which "unquestionably" caused
Pittsburgh's demise in Oakland.
Next a writer from the city of the winning
team will claim that his hometown team's
victory was meaningless. His column will
begin with the phrase "on any given day,"and
will close with 'Thank you, Lady Luck."
He will claim that the winning team was
victorious because it saw "Jumbo," the night
before the game, while the opposition
watched "Magnum Force." He will point out
that many of the team's stars are "over the
hill" and will claim that the team's
management has "drafted pathetically" in
recent years. He will claim his skepticism will
stop only when the team wins 35 consecutive
Super Bowls and all the players walk on
water.
Then some writer from the city of the
losing team will write one of those famous
"alibi columns." Already the Vikings have
called their locker room facilities "terrible"
and head coach Bud Grant has screamed,
"There's no place to hang clothes."
The Dolphins have not sent any trial alibis
aloft yet, but if the Vikings win, rest assured

some Miami writer will find enough alibis for
a dozen columns. He will start with the glare
caused by the Vikings' overwaxed helmets and
end with Larry Csonka's wake-up call, which
came at 7:18 Sunday morning instead of
7:19.
He will also mention the greased shoulder
pads the Vikings were wearing; the defective
cleats which were put on the Dolphins' shoes
in an act of "clear sabotage;" and the football
which was overinflated by one sixteenth of an
ounce.
Finally, writers from "neutral cities" will
moan about how the Super Bowl really
doesn't decide who is the best pro football
team. In light of the controversy over the
finest college football team, this type of
column has already begun to appear. But the
real onslaught of these columns won't begin
until next week.
These writers will all begin their columns
by saying, "The World Series, the NBA
Championship and the Stanley Cup are not
decided by one game." "On any given day"
will surely appear in these columns also as the
writers propose a seven-game series to be
played in various neutral sites.
These writers will decry the "home field
advantage" Miami had in "nearby Houston"
and suggest that games in the seven-game
Super Series should all be played out of the
United States, so that no team can "stack the
stands with its fans." Some writer will propose
that the State Department immediately look
into the possibility of financing stadiums at
the North Pole, in downtown Rio de Janeiro
and on the Suez Canal to house the series.
Which reminds me, I think I'll leave the
country next week to avoid reading any of
these columns. Happy Super Bowl.
