Dramatic Wholesale Price Rise
WASHINGTON — Another round of sharp fuel
and food price increases in December ended the
worst annual wholesale price rise in a quarter
century, the government reported yesterday.
The Labor Department said the December
seasonally adjusted increase of 2.2 percent pushed
wholesale prices in 1973 to a level 18.2 percent
higher than a year ago, most in any year since the
31.7 percent increase in 1946 during the post-World
War II inflation.
Retail prices rose about 8 percent in 1973.
The Wholesale Price Index, a barometer of
consumer price increases forecast for the months
ahead, showed that over-all energy prices soared by
65.1 percent last year, with costs of refined
petroleum products up an unprecedented 125
percent.
The year's over-all increase meant it costs
$145.30 to buy the same amount of wholesale
goods that $100 purchased in the 1967 base period.
Farm products prices rose 36.1 percent over the
past 12 months while processed foods and feeds
climbed 20.3 percent.
At the Western White House, presidential
spokesman Gerald L. Warren attributed the rise to a
"onetime adjustment to higher energy prices" and
to adjustments due to short food supplies. He said
the administration still expects to "restore a
reasonable degree of price stability" but would not
disclose what, if any, economic steps the President
is considering to curb the upward spiral.
Chairman Herbert Stein of the President's
Council of Economic Advisers predicted the rate of
inflation would slow sharply when the current
round of price increases for petroleum and energy
supplies have ended and when the food supply
catches up with demand.
Juries Can Use Unlawful Evidence
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
granted prosecutors the right to use illegally
gathered evidence in grand jury probes.
The 6-3 decision said criminal suspects may not
prevent grand juries from using evidence police
gather unlawfully, nor may the suspects refuse to
answer questions based on the evidence.
It was the second major decision since the court
term opened in October strengthening the hand of
law enforcement. The dissenters claimed that it
came at the expense of the Fourth Amendment
prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures.
The decision carved out a substantial exception
to the controversial "exclusionary rule," a major
source of complaints that criminals go free on
"technicalities."
In the search case, the majority said suppression
of illegally gathered evidence could still be argued
when a case goes to trial.
"The grand jury's investigative power must be
broad if its public responsibility is adequately to be
discharged," said Lewis F. Powell Jr. for the
majority which included Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger, Potter Stewart, Byron R. White, Harry A.
Blackmun and William H. Rehnquist.
In dissent, Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
declared, "The court today discounts to the point
of extinction the vital function of the rule to insure
that the judiciary avoids even the slightest
appearance of sanctioning illegal government
conduct."
He was joined by Justices William O. Douglas and
Thurgood Marshall.

The case stemmed from a search by federal
agents of the home and business of a Cleveland
Heights, Ohio man, John P. Calandra, for illegal
gambling evidence. None was turned up, but agents
found evidence of alleged illegal loan-sharking
activities, which Calandra attempted to suppress as
the product of an unlawful search when he was
called before the grand jury for questioning.
Brennan Sides With Workers
WASHINGTON — Labor Secretary Peter J.
Brennan yesterday sided with workers seeking
higher pay hikes this year, saying they are entitled
to "their share of the spoils" wrought by inflation.
His comments came as yet another indication
that the administration may soon boost — or
abandon — altogether — the current salary increase
guideline of 5.5 percent. The government's blessing
already has gone to several major settlements
substantially above that mark.
At a news conference, the secretary said he does
not at this time know what action the Cost of
Living Council would take, but added that if the
inflationary trend continues wage contract demands
would be much higher in 1974.
"I believe working people are entitled to their
share of the spoils," Brennan said. "Workers will be
looking for their pound of flesh, and I'm not saying
they're wrong."
Officials ( all For Drilling
OCALA, Fla. — Oil industry officials testified
yesterday that America faces a long-term energy
crisis, making it imperative to drill for oil and
natural gas in Florida's Ocala National Forest.
Conservationists claim drilling would damage the
environment of the 366,000-acre wilderness, home
to the Florida panther, bears and deer and a
recreation area for thousands.
Conservationists also fear drilling operations
would damage the central Florida aquifer, a vital
recharge area for fresh water located in the heart of
the forest.
America's energy deficiency will exist for
another 10 to 15 years, said Jerrold M. Pachman, an
economist for Amoco, at the start of a two-day U.S.
Department of Interior hearing on proposed drilling.
"Given rational and responsible environmental
safeguards, it is imperative that all prospective areas
be explored," Pachman said.
The 30 persons at the hearing included
environmentalists, industry and oil company
representatives and state and federal officials.
Oil Cut 'Probable'
GENEVA, Switzerland — The skyrocketing price
of Persian Gulf oil may be rolled back six percent
next month because of the dollar's growing
strength, an Iranian official said yesterday.
But even if the rollback takes effect, it will be
little comfort to consumers affected by the
approximately 400 percent increase in the cost of
Persian Gulf oil in the past year.
Iranian Finance Minister Jamshid Amouzegar
told newsmen the rollback was "probable" under a
1972 agreement in oil contracts providing for
monthly readjustments tied to the strength of the
dollar.
The largest cost of producing oil comes from
taxes paid by oil companies to the producing
countries. These are calculated in dollars, and when
the dollar is strong, the oil countries get fewer of
them. Conversely, when the United States currency
is weak, they get more.

The dollar, growing stronger on foreign currency
markets because of predictions that the United
States will weather the energy crisis better than
other consuming nations, reached its highest point
since last February on Tuesday in Paris, Frankfurt,
Brussels and Milan.
Amouzegar spoke during a recess of the meeting
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries — OPEC.
Arabs Prepare For Summit
BEIRUT, Lebanon — An artillery and tank battle
between Israel and Syria broke out yesterday on the
Golan Heights while three Arab nations were laying
plans for a summit conference to coordinate policy
toward Israel.
Syria said 25 Israeli soldiers were killed in the
battle, but the Israeli command reported it suffered
only seven wounded.
Israel said the seven casualties occurred during
exchanges of artillery and tank fire on the Syrian
front that lasted almost seven hours. A communique
said the Syrians opened artillery and tank fire on
Israeli positions south of Beit Jon on the Golan
Heights, and Israeli troops returned the fire.
It said Egyptian forces also opened small-arms
and mortar fire on Israeli positions along the Suez
Canal during the day, but reported no Israeli
casualties.
The Syrian version of the battle was in a
communique broadcast over Damascus radio.
Egypt, Syria and Jordan agreed to hold a summit
meeting in Damascus to set joint policies for the
second stage of the Arab-Israeli peace talks in
Geneva, according to Arab diplomats.
They said King Hussein of Jordan wants the
three Arab countries plus the Palestinians and
Lebanon represented by one unified delegation at
the Geneva negotiations.
Hussein is expected to strongly urge the
unification move at the coming Damascus summit
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Syrian
President Hafez Assad, said one diplomatic
informant.
U.S. Considers Talks With Cuba
WASHINGTON — The State Department was
studying yesterday the possibility of U.S.-Cuban
talks on renewing diplomatic relations following
reports of Cuba's willingness to consider the subject
under certain circumstances.
Cuba's ambassador to Mexico, Fernando Lopez
Muino, said his government is "ready to discuss, not
establish" relations with the United States if
Washington is prepared to end its support of the
nine-year-old hemispheric embargo of the Caribbean
island.
The conciliatory statement appeared to at least
partially satisfy one of the two conditions for
improving relations with Cuba outlined by Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger 12 days ago. Kissinger
said then that "the hostility of the government of
Cuba" has been one of two major obstacles to
rapprochement.
