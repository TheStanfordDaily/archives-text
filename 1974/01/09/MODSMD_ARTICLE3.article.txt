## Lowenstein Wants Impeachment 
### NANCI COLVERT 
Former New York Rep. Allard
Lowenstein, number seven on the
White House enemies list, said last
night that "we want impeachment
with a trial and evidence, not a
resignation — a trial in the U.S. Senate,
not the media.
"We are given two options and it is
important to replace Nixon. To leave
him in office would be giving the seal
of public approval to all he has done,"
Lowenstein told 125 listeners at
Tresidder Union.
"Sabotaging of the political process
is one of his [Nixon's] goals and
achievements," Lowenstein declared.
The important of the enemies list,
he said, is that it represents high
officials' organized efforts to harass
and remove from effective activity
people they don't like.
'More Effective'
"The fact that I'm on the enemies
list tells me I'm more effective than I
may have thought," he said.
The Administration is attempting
to "poison the public dialogue and
pervert the political opportunities of
people so that the voters are never
confronted with real choices," said
Lowenstein, former chairman of the
Americans for Democratic Action.
In presenting his case for
impeachment, Lowenstein cited the
milk deal, San Clemente improvements
and actions of White House officials
and cabinet members in the Watergate
affair and related abuses.
"The reelection of the President
was equated with the national
security ... In the milk deal, the
people were allowed to participate in
making the country more secure by
paying three cents more for their milk
because price ceilings were lifted by
the government in exchange for Nixon
campaign contributions by the

corporations.
"A woman in Bushwood watches as
the ceiling falls on her child because
Nixon impounded the money for
public housing while at the same time
we are paying $18,000 for a brown
picket fence at San Clemente," he
said.
Lowenstein, twice a visiting
professor at Stanford, compared the
impeachment procedings of Andrew
Johnson to the case against Nixon.
"I believe Johnson's defense will be
Nixon's conviction. Johnson was
impeached for firing the secretary of
war without the approval of the
Senate. He defended himself saying
that the constitution made him
accountable for the actions of all his
appointees and so his action was
therefore justified."
Case Clear
In Nixon's case, if he is to be held
accountable for the actions of his
appointees, the case for impeachment

is clear, said Lowenstein.
"If you let him stay, we've given
public acceptance to what he has
done," he said.
Lowenstein was elected to a
congressional seat from Long Island in
1968 but was gerrymandered out of
his seat. He ran again in 1970 and
1972, but lost both times.
Senate Seat
It has been rumored that
Lowenstein will seek the seat of Sen.
Jacob Javits, R-N.Y., this year, but
Lowenstein said that he has not yet
decided and probably would not do so
for several months.
When asked about possible
candidates for the presidential election
of 1976, Lowenstein said it is too
early to tell, especially with the
possibility of new leadership before
then.
