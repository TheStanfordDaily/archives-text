# Trustees Approve Faculty Apartments
## 
### JOHN FREED 
University trustees yesterday
formally approved construction of a
100-unit, multi-story on-campus
apartment project for emeritus and
junior faculty, which will force
relocation of the Child Care Center,
Hurlburt House and the Music
department this summer.
A survey of eligible future residents
of the project, revealed that they
would be willing to live in a three- to
nine-floor building, although James
Nelson, director of the Planning
Office, said the structure will be
"probably not in excess of three
stories."
Senior and emeriti members of the
faculty are expected to dominate
occupancy in the complex . Building
at the site, the corner of Mayfield and
Santa Ynez, should start next June if
trustees approve final plans in March
or April.
Locations Uncertain
The three organizations now
occupying the land are uncertain
where they will be located next fall.
Representatives of the Child Care
Center, Hurlburt (Grove) House and
the Music Department all stated that
the University had not yet told them
where they will be relocated. Phyllis
Craig, consultant on child care to the
dean of student affairs, said that she
expects word on relocation within a
month, but contended that her major
worries are elsewhere.
'The big decision is: Where's the
money going to come from? A very
small percentage comes from the
emeritus housing contract. But we
don't know where the big part of the
money is going to come from," she
stated.
Hurlburt House resident assistant
Dave Sklar noted that the University
has not informed Hurlburt residents of
the impending move-out.
"They haven't even mentioned it. I
understood that, eventually, they

would put an extension of Campus
Drive through here. A real question in
my mind is: Do we really want new
traffic on the campus?" Sklar said.
Sites Discussed
John Planting, administrative
assistant in the Music Department, said
that several relocation sites for the
department had been discussed,
including one behind the Knoll. He
also stated that the determining factor
will be "whatever the Planning Office
decides."
Planning Office Director Nelson
was optimistic about a solution. "We
would certainly hope that a solution
acceptable to a 11... will be the
result," he said.
The pending relocation of the
Stanford Child Care Center, which
operates the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community and the Little
Kids' Place, could deal a crippling
blow to the financially struggling
organization, which is not subsidized
by the University.
Financial Problem
Craig, who formerly directed the
Children's Center, drove the point
home: "The problem is a financial
one. Somehow a new building has to
be acquired, or built... or
something," she observed. "There are
a few [relocation] sites available to us,
two of which we feel would be
feasible, one of which would be
economically feasible."
The Child Care Center's move
comes just two years after $11,000
was authorized for capital
improvements at the present site
through an ASSU fee assessment.
"At the time they [the ASSU]
voted, the center wasn't licensed. It
was thought... that the center would
have to spend an enormous amount of
money... just to get licensed.
Eighteen months ago we discovered
that this was not needed. We knew we
were going to move, so we hoarded
that money," Craig explained.

'The big decision is: Where's the
money going to come from? A very
small percentage comes from the
emeritus housing contract. But we
don't know where the big part of the
money is going to come from," she
stated.
Hurlburt House resident assistant
Dave Sklar noted that the University
has not informed Hurlburt residents of
the impending move-out.
"They haven't even mentioned it. I
understood that, eventually, they

would put an extension of Campus
Drive through here. A real question in
my mind is: Do we really want new
traffic on the campus?" Sklar said.
Sites Discussed
John Planting, administrative
assistant in the Music Department, said
that several relocation sites for the
department had been discussed,
including one behind the Knoll. He
also stated that the determining factor
will be "whatever the Planning Office
decides."
Planning Office Director Nelson
was optimistic about a solution. "We
would certainly hope that a solution
acceptable to a 11... will be the
result," he said.
The pending relocation of the
Stanford Child Care Center, which
operates the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community and the Little
Kids' Place, could deal a crippling
blow to the financially struggling
organization, which is not subsidized
by the University.
Financial Problem
Craig, who formerly directed the
Children's Center, drove the point
home: "The problem is a financial
one. Somehow a new building has to
be acquired, or built... or
something," she observed. "There are
a few [relocation] sites available to us,
two of which we feel would be
feasible, one of which would be
economically feasible."
The Child Care Center's move
comes just two years after $11,000
was authorized for capital
improvements at the present site
through an ASSU fee assessment.
"At the time they [the ASSU]
voted, the center wasn't licensed. It
was thought... that the center would
have to spend an enormous amount of
money... just to get licensed.
Eighteen months ago we discovered
that this was not needed. We knew we
were going to move, so we hoarded
that money," Craig explained.
University trustees yesterday
formally approved construction of a
100-unit, multi-story on-campus
apartment project for emeritus and
junior faculty, which will force
relocation of the Child Care Center,
Hurlburt House and the Music
department this summer.
A survey of eligible future residents
of the project, revealed that they
would be willing to live in a three- to
nine-floor building, although James
Nelson, director of the Planning
Office, said the structure will be
"probably not in excess of three
stories."
Senior and emeriti members of the
faculty are expected to dominate
occupancy in the complex . Building
at the site, the corner of Mayfield and
Santa Ynez, should start next June if
trustees approve final plans in March
or April.
Locations Uncertain
The three organizations now
occupying the land are uncertain
where they will be located next fall.
Representatives of the Child Care
Center, Hurlburt (Grove) House and
the Music Department all stated that
the University had not yet told them
where they will be relocated. Phyllis
Craig, consultant on child care to the
dean of student affairs, said that she
expects word on relocation within a
month, but contended that her major
worries are elsewhere.
