# KZSU Wants Cage Broadcasts Back

Second Of Two Parts
KZSU and Athletic Department
representatives are attempting to
resolve a controversy regarding the
radio stations broadcasting Stanford
basketball games.
Because KZSU airs the games on
FM and reaches out into the
community for underwriters, the
department is "in violation of an
exclusive contract with [San Francisco
station] KSFO that has been in
existence for a number of years,"
according to a letter from Athletic
Director Joseph H. Ruetz to
then-KZSU station manager Lloyd
Snook.
However, this procedure has been
going on since at least the beginning of
the academic year without any
previous protest from the Athletic
Department. When Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy became aware of
the conflict last month, he realized
something had to be done, he said.
The result was Ruetz's letter of
Dec. 27, which outlined the
department's position. "The
department wishes very much to
cooperate with the student radio
station on this matter and will do
everything within reason to assist
within the parameters of these
guidelines," it stated, a position
emphasized by Murphy. "I am in
sympathy with them as a radio
station," Murphy said, but added that
the Athletic Department had to
"protect areas where we're
committed."

To resolve the controversy, Ruetz
suggested that KZSU use only its AM
carrier current feed to the campus
dorms for broadcasting athletic events.
Doing this would limit the listening
audience to about 3000 students,
instead of KZSU's present potential
audience of 50,000 people.
KZSU Station Manager Gary
Fazzino said that the station could not
adequately serve the community on
AM. He cited the addition of FM
broadcasting in 1964 and the current
effort to increase KZSU's power as
examples of previous efforts toward
serving the entire community.
The other primary goal of KZSU
broadcasts, and the one emphasized by
Murphy, is the training of college
students as sportscasters â€” which can
be accomplished either on AM or FM.
The conflict intensifies where
KZSU's service to the Stanford
community interferes with KSFO's
broadcasting the games, chiefly in the
area of advertising and underwriting.
Potential Audience
The KZSU broadcast detracts from
the potential KSFO listening audience
in the immediate area which KZSU
reaches, but does not affect the major
portion of KSFO's territory. However,
the largest concentration of people
who follow Stanford athletics are no
doubt within range of KZSU,
according to KSFO Director of
Operations Robert A. Hansen.
In his recent letter, Ruetz
stipulated that KZSU could carry the
games on AM if "they do not solicit
underwriters or advertisers using

Stanford athletic contests as part of
their underwriting package, nor
mention any underwriter by name on
their broadcast."
How much KZSU's solicitation of
underwriting hurts KSFO is debatable,
but the Athletic Department wants to
take no chances that one of KSFO's
sponsors will drop the broadcasts for
this reason. KSFO lost one of its
sponsors (an oil company) this year
and "is operating at a very thin
margin," Ruetz's letter stated.
Complicate Terms
"Anything that would further
complicate the terms of the written
contract would probably cause us to
lose what we have," it added. KSFO
currently pays $28,000 for the rights
to broadcast Stanford football and
basketball games.
