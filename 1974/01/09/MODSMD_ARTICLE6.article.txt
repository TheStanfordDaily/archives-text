# Stanford, Berkeley Murders Related?
## 
### 
A Dec. 20 murder on the University
of California at Berkeley campus and a
September killing at Stanford may be
related, Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Sgt. Robert Malone said yesterday.
David Levine, a junior physics
major here, was stabbed to death near
the Undergraduate Library, sometime
between 1 and 3 a.m. on Sept. 11. He
died from at least 12 stab wounds in
the back, inflicted with a long knife.
Sheriff's investigators found no
signs of a struggle and could not
discover a motive for the Levine
murder. The case is now open but
inactive â€” detectives have no leads and
no suspects.
At Berkeley, the victim was Eric
Abramson, a chemistry graduate
student from Ardmore, Penn.
Sometime between 9:30 and 10:30
p.m. on Dec. 20, he was stabbed
several times in the chest and back.
Police found his body near the Cal
Faculty Club at 10:56 p.m., in a
partially-enclosed garage. They
theorize that Abramson struggled with
his murderer, because of "defense
wounds" on his hands and a 200-foot
long line of bloodstains leading to his
body.
U.C.-Berkeley Detective Patrick
Carroll yesterday said his department
has no promising leads and no suspects
in the Abramson case.
Police theorize that Abramson was
walking from a chemistry laboratory
to his Telegraph Avenue apartment

when he was killed. Area residents say
they heard screams at about 10 p.m.,
but did not investigate.
As soon as police discovered the
body, they sealed off the entire
Berkeley campus and searched it. They
found a blood-stained pencil and a pair
of glasses near the body, but nothing
more.
In both cases, police have ruled out
robbery as a motive, and have not
discovered a personal motive like a
feud or fight. The weapon in both
cases apparently was a knife with an
eight- to 10-inch long blade. And both
occurred at night during a
recess between academic quarters.
The day after the Berkeley murder,
two Stanford officials posted a
handbill around campus warning
residents to take "precautionary
measures" because the two cases were
"very similar."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Police Services Director
Marvin Herrington urged people
working late on campus to inform
their roommates of their location and
planned time of return, and to report
suspicious people to the Police
Services Department.
Stanford has offered a $10,000
reward for information leading tn the
arrest and conviction of Levine's killer.
An anonymous citizen in Beikeley has
posted a $1000 reward in the
Abramson slaying.
