# Fuel Use Dropped 36 Percent

### 
The University cut heating fuel consumption by more than one-third
during the holidays, Dan DeYoung, director of plant services, reported
yesterday.
The amount of fuel used during the Dec. 20-Jan. 6 period was measured
at 436,206 "therm factors," compared to 687,437 units of fuel
consumption used during the same time period last year â€” a drop of 36
percent.
The University closed most dormitories and limited the amount of heat
used in academic buildings during the holiday period in order to conserve
on both fuel and electricity.
Meter reading comparisons on the amount of electricity used during the
vacation will not be available until Jan. 20. However, DeYoung previously
noted that electrical consumption was cut 20.8 percent during the Nov.
1-Dec. 20 time period, compared to last year. This cut was accomplished
by such measures as removing unnecessary fluorescent lights and turning
down blowers.
The reduction in fuel consumption not only saved money but insured
that the University has what DeYoung called an "adequate" seven-day
supply of heating oil for use when Pacific Gas & Electric interrupts gas
service.
