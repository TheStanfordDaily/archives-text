# Middle Class Inertia

Whatever became of the efforts of
certain sections of the populace to
engage in vigorous political activity
and effect revolutionary change? Or
perchance it would be prudent to pose
the preliminary problem of precisely
who proposes to proffer his
excrement?
As seems obvious to all, political
activities of late have borne a serenity
that is really quite remarkable. We
have witnessed only the most minor of
civil commotions or social
perturbations. Inasmuch as there were
few such disquieting incidents last
year, it seems reasonable that the
Zeitgeist in the years just ahead would
entail a similar state of tranquillity.
Of utmost importance is to be
apprised of the conduct of each of the
social classes in either effecting change
or "nipping it in the bud." The
bourgeois elements, of course,
comprise the forces of reaction. It is
they who would incur irreparable loss
were they to be the object of
revolutionary transformation. On the
other side of the glass, however, the
proletarian elements, especially those
of the Third World persuasions, would
probably realize swell benefits from
such a change.
But what of the petty bourgeoisie?
What of this world-reknowned class
characterized by mediocre and insipid
living arrangements? A graduate to this
class, at various times of his waking
day, manifests multitudinous and
petty antipathies toward the
contemporary bourgeois state, and, in
his sleep, affirms his acquiescence to
the ongoing control of productive
labor and the service workers.
Humanitarian and liberal altruists
may be unearthed at any level of
society. To count actually the number
of petty bourgeois persons who will
never abandon the fight for
revolutionary transformation of this
country's structure, however, entails
difficulties not unlike those
encountered in searching for polar
bears in the Mojave desert (or in any
other desert, for that matter).
Examination
Let us then proceed to examine
why socialist revolution in the U.S.
has yet to assume any significant
degree of popularity in the minds of
the Middle class.
A middle person is typically
confronted with an election of three
possibilities: (1) One endures a
lifetime of the most modest comfort,
replete with petty luxuries; (2) One
negates his class heritage and initiates
comradery with members of a lower
class; or (3) One acquires the

attendant qualities to be classified a
"fascist pig." No difficulty is
encountered in noting that a majority
of Middle and student sectors are
electing the former choice. That
course is no more aberrant, one would
be inclined to suppose, than a man's
sauntering about on his feet, rather
than on his hands.
Let us hazard yet another
elucidation. It has been apparent that
revolutionaries in this country have
been attempting to disturb the
somewhat decadent and tranquil
nature of middle class culture by their
appearance and by the exhortative
rhetoric that is their sine qua non.
Social Copulation
An aura of galvanization and
fossilization attends many
revolutionaries, wherever they go. One
cannot help speculate on some sort of
social copulation â€” with the dead
bodies of a plan gone astray. The
existence of an appreciation of reality
in their lives is an open question.
Communist organizations have noted
with some pride their unpopularity
with the Middle classes. At the same
time, though, they attempt to induce
guilt complexes in petty-bourgeois
people, proferring rhetorical inquiries
about their non-involvement.
Yet another reason in addition to
these mentioned is an American
revolutionary's perpetual references to
his bookshelves of Communist
literature. It appears that the Middle
classes in this country cannot with
facility relate their present
conceptions of modern technological
society with the essentially foreign and
outdated attributes of extant
revolutionist writing.
What of it all? It would not be
logical to assume that Middle people
will never desire full-scale revolution in
this country. Apparently, though, such
a state of affairs must have as a
presupposition the existence of an
acceptable life style concurrent with
revolutionary change. We note with
some pretentious objective neutrality
that all Communist theoreticians scoff
at the possibility of such a
presupposition.
At this time, those petty bourgeois
persons apart from the humanitarian
and liberal altruists, have only to
determine a suitable method for
preoccupying their minds and souls
during the long hours of middle class
inertia. They have only to refrain from
prosecuting themselves on charges of
being Middle class and white. On a
mass scale such a recognition of one's
background may perhaps instill a more
reasonable social order.
