# How To Amend Your Plans
## Realistic New Year Resolutions 
### 
If there is an unknown force in
human nature which coerces us to
make New Year's Resolutions, there
must also be a demonic influence
which causes us to break them all.
Guilt complexes often develop from
this common turn of events, and
people feel frustrated with themselves
as new leaves, which are just recently
overturned, are soon turned back to
their original unhappy state.
So, in the spirit of preservation of
mental health, let us look at a few
time-worn resolutions from young Bill
Trihard's diary of last year, which
might be quite similar to some you've
made in your sordid past or present.
Remember, that like any resolution,
New Year's Resolutions don't have to
be broken if you don't follow them.
They are not ironclad self-agreements.
Like any other resolutions, New Year's
Resolutions can be amended. Here
then are a few resolutions from Bill's
diary along with some key

If there is an unknown force in
human nature which coerces us to
make New Year's Resolutions, there
must also be a demonic influence
which causes us to break them all.
Guilt complexes often develop from
this common turn of events, and
people feel frustrated with themselves
as new leaves, which are just recently
overturned, are soon turned back to
their original unhappy state.
So, in the spirit of preservation of
mental health, let us look at a few
time-worn resolutions from young Bill
Trihard's diary of last year, which
might be quite similar to some you've
made in your sordid past or present.
Remember, that like any resolution,
New Year's Resolutions don't have to
be broken if you don't follow them.
They are not ironclad self-agreements.

Resolutions can be amended. Here

fall behind in all my classes and end up

If there is an unknown force in
human nature which coerces us to
make New Year's Resolutions, there
must also be a demonic influence
which causes us to break them all.
Guilt complexes often develop from
this common turn of events, and
people feel frustrated with themselves
as new leaves, which are just recently
overturned, are soon turned back to
their original unhappy state.
So, in the spirit of preservation of
mental health, let us look at a few
time-worn resolutions from young Bill
Trihard's diary of last year, which
might be quite similar to some you've
made in your sordid past or present.

If there is an unknown force in
human nature which coerces us to
make New Year's Resolutions, there
must also be a demonic influence
which causes us to break them all.
Guilt complexes often develop from
this common turn of events, and
people feel frustrated with themselves
as new leaves, which are just recently
overturned, are soon turned back to
their original unhappy state.
So, in the spirit of preservation of
mental health, let us look at a few
time-worn resolutions from young Bill
Trihard's diary of last year, which
might be quite similar to some you've
made in your sordid past or present.
Remember, that like any resolution,
New Year's Resolutions don't have to
be broken if you don't follow them.
They are not ironclad self-agreements.
Like any other resolutions, New Year's
Resolutions can be amended. Here
then are a few resolutions from Bill's
diary along with some key
amendments and the date when these
amendments were made:

enough, other than books for classes,

fall behind in all my classes and end up
