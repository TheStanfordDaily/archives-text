WE DIDN'T MAKE IT LAST TIME

Unfortunately, no members of the Daily made the White House Enemies List. 11
I lie Daily is a college paper, and it's considered one of the best. But it can he much, much better with II
your help.
We need reporters, photographers, reviewers, night staffers â€” in fact, if you're interested in working on
the paper, there's a place for you.
We do our best. We want to do better. If you're interested, come to an orientation meeting for 11
prospective staffers Friday at I p.m. in our offices in the Storke Student Publications Building on Lomita 'Â»
Drive between Panama and Santa Teresa Streets.
We didn t make the Enemies List this time. But maybe next time . . .
