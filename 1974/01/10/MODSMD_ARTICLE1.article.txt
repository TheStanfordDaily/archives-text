# Guerard Turns Tables On Literary Conventions
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
An almost surreal melange of
objects faces the front door inside
English Prof. Albert Guerard's home.
On the hall table sits a stone bust of
Voltaire. Above it hangs a black and
white Impeach-Nixon poster, and on
the floor, a yellow "Under
Construction" sign leans playfully
against the antique table-leg.
The living room is filled with Louis
XVI furniture which seems strangely
at odds with suburban Stanford.
Albert Guerard, novelist, literary
critic and professor at Stanford since
1961, lives in the same house which
his celebrated Parisian father Albert
Leon Guerard occupied while he
taught English at Stanford
(1907-1913; 1924-1945).
"Such in fact, is my very
un-American situation. I find myself
working in his study, my study, across
the hall from where I wrote my first
short stories in 1929," Guerard wrote
in Southern Review.
Some neighbors even claim that
Guerard is even beginning to
physically resemble his father.
Comparing Guerard with his father,
Mary Maclin, his wife, said, "You
could ask Papa any historical fact, and
he could answer you. Albert has very
little sense of history. He is searching
after a greater truth. He is very
creative."
New Methods
Sitting cross-legged in his Stanford
office, Guerard discussed his
forthcoming novel.
"I'm trying something zanier. In
my previous six novels, my writing was
very carefully modulated. I feel
embarrassed about using the methods I
used 15 years ago, because they
definitely seem outmoded. I think you
shouldn't keep writing the same book
all your life. One should change."
Guerard admires anti-realist novelist
John Hawkes more than any other
modern writer. "The very best writers
feel obliged to break the novel form.
Hawkes is one of the few writers who
does his thing regardless of what is

around him. I love his absolute
originality."
Teaching Easier
Teaching comes more easily to
Guerard than writing. "I enjoy
teaching more, because in writing, you
have the agonizing sense of not
knowing if you're going anywhere."
Guerard taught English at Harvard
from 1938 to 1961, and then came to
Stanford.
In his class "The Impressionist and
Experimental Novel," which he taught
fall quarter, Guerard seemed to
converse with his students rather than
lecture to them.
After he asks a question, Guerard
scans the room, moving only his eyes,
looking for a raised hand. When a
student answers, he tilts his head
slightly to the side, listens intently,
and his eyes hardly waver from the
student who is speaking.
Guerard stresses words at almost
rhythmical intervals. When an idea
particularly appeals to him, his rhythm
slows, and his words seem to hang in
mid-air.
Occasionally, he either sweeps his
hands through his gray hair, or thrusts
them into his pockets, where he often
jangles coins or keys.
A former student, junior Craig
Seligman, confirms that "Guerard
respects his students intellectually."
Another student, senior Gene Richie,
credits Guerard with "taking time for
students."
Receptive Teacher
English Prof. Thomas Moser, who
wrote his dissertation under Guerard's
direction at Harvard, remembers him
as a devoted and much-respected
teacher.
"The most striking quality about
him was his warmth and easiness.
There was nothing he wouldn't do for
his students. He was the most popular
teacher in the English Department. I
worshipped him."
Guerard encourages innovative
teaching. "Albert loves change. He's a
terrific idea man," his wife says."He
has even dreamt of starting his own

university, and has playfully drawn up
lists of prospective faculty members."
Since his arrival in 1961, Guerard
has changed several facets of the
English Department. He began the
interdisciplinary program in Modern
Thought and Literature and the
Freshman Seminar Program in 1962.
While he was director of the Freshman
English Program from 1965 to 1967,
Guerard organized the Voice Project,
in which 10 novelists, John Hawkes
among them, experimented with new
ways to teach freshman writing.
Gide Influence
French novelist Andre Gide deeply
influenced Guerard's tendency to
experiment and innovate.
He first met Gide in Paris in 1945,
and began intensively reading his
works two years later when he taught
a course at Harvard on Conrad, Hardy
and Gide.
"I tend not to think that one figure
can change a personality, but what was
left of my puritanical side was pretty
much demolished by Gide. Gide was a
sinuous, playful person. He believed
that everything must be tried. I had
been repressing a lot of anxiety and
sexual termoil. I read every word of
Gide through. As I got into it, it got
more and more intense. I was 32 when
I began to work on Gide. It's unusual
to be changed that late in life."
Politics has always strongly affected
Guerard, and consequently his fiction.

In June, 1959, he left Harvard for
Havana, Port-au-Prince and Cuidad
Trujillo, to study the political
revolutions which had erupted there.
Describing the reasons for his
trip, Guerard wrote in 1972, "To be
away from intellectuals and academic
debate was at least part of my need. I
think I had good reason for seeking
fictional worlds outside our fat and
complacent Eisenhower America, in a
turbulence where most political
choices were matters of life-or-death."
However, the most jarring years for
Guerard were those he spent in France
during World War II as a United States
Intelligence Service (USIS) propaganda
agent.
"I was lying professionally and have
a retrospective feeling of guilt about
that.
"I had left a hardworking academic
environment, and was confronted with
a sordid and comic world. I slowly
began to realize that our liberation of
Europe was a ruinous thing. I had
considerable sympathy with the
Socialist middle, which was being
rubbed out on one side by the
Russians, and on the other side by us."
"Through all these experiences,"
Guerard wrote in Southern Review,
"There persists a distaste for the
grosser manifestations of American
moralism, and power, and a distaste,
too, for classifying whole people as
'the enemy.' "

In June, 1959, he left Harvard for
Havana, Port-au-Prince and Cuidad
Trujillo, to study the political
revolutions which had erupted there.
Describing the reasons for his
trip, Guerard wrote in 1972, "To be
away from intellectuals and academic
debate was at least part of my need. I
think I had good reason for seeking
fictional worlds outside our fat and
complacent Eisenhower America, in a
turbulence where most political
choices were matters of life-or-death."
However, the most jarring years for
Guerard were those he spent in France
during World War II as a United States
Intelligence Service (USIS) propaganda
agent.
"I was lying professionally and have
a retrospective feeling of guilt about
that.
"I had left a hardworking academic
environment, and was confronted with
a sordid and comic world. I slowly
began to realize that our liberation of
Europe was a ruinous thing. I had
considerable sympathy with the
Socialist middle, which was being
rubbed out on one side by the
Russians, and on the other side by us."
"Through all these experiences,"
Guerard wrote in Southern Review,
"There persists a distaste for the
grosser manifestations of American
moralism, and power, and a distaste,
too, for classifying whole people as
'the enemy.' "

INNOVATIVE ENGLISH PROFESSOR - Albert Guerard enlivens his classes as
well as his novels with untraditional and experimental ideas sparked by Andre
Gide's writings.
An almost surreal melange of
objects faces the front door inside
English Prof. Albert Guerard's home.
On the hall table sits a stone bust of
Voltaire. Above it hangs a black and
white Impeach-Nixon poster, and on
the floor, a yellow "Under
Construction" sign leans playfully
against the antique table-leg.
The living room is filled with Louis
XVI furniture which seems strangely
at odds with suburban Stanford.
Albert Guerard, novelist, literary
critic and professor at Stanford since
1961, lives in the same house which
his celebrated Parisian father Albert
Leon Guerard occupied while he
taught English at Stanford
(1907-1913; 1924-1945).
"Such in fact, is my very
un-American situation. I find myself
working in his study, my study, across
the hall from where I wrote my first
short stories in 1929," Guerard wrote
in Southern Review.
Some neighbors even claim that
Guerard is even beginning to
physically resemble his father.
Comparing Guerard with his father,
Mary Maclin, his wife, said, "You
could ask Papa any historical fact, and
he could answer you. Albert has very
little sense of history. He is searching
after a greater truth. He is very
creative."
New Methods
Sitting cross-legged in his Stanford
office, Guerard discussed his
forthcoming novel.
"I'm trying something zanier. In
my previous six novels, my writing was
very carefully modulated. I feel
embarrassed about using the methods I
used 15 years ago, because they
definitely seem outmoded. I think you
shouldn't keep writing the same book
all your life. One should change."
Guerard admires anti-realist novelist
John Hawkes more than any other
modern writer. "The very best writers
feel obliged to break the novel form.
Hawkes is one of the few writers who
does his thing regardless of what is

around him. I love his absolute
originality."
Teaching Easier
Teaching comes more easily to
Guerard than writing. "I enjoy
teaching more, because in writing, you
have the agonizing sense of not
knowing if you're going anywhere."
Guerard taught English at Harvard
from 1938 to 1961, and then came to
Stanford.
In his class "The Impressionist and
Experimental Novel," which he taught
fall quarter, Guerard seemed to
converse with his students rather than
lecture to them.
After he asks a question, Guerard
scans the room, moving only his eyes,
looking for a raised hand. When a
student answers, he tilts his head
slightly to the side, listens intently,
and his eyes hardly waver from the
student who is speaking.
Guerard stresses words at almost
rhythmical intervals. When an idea
particularly appeals to him, his rhythm
slows, and his words seem to hang in
mid-air.
Occasionally, he either sweeps his
hands through his gray hair, or thrusts
them into his pockets, where he often
jangles coins or keys.
A former student, junior Craig
Seligman, confirms that "Guerard
respects his students intellectually."
Another student, senior Gene Richie,
credits Guerard with "taking time for
students."
Receptive Teacher
English Prof. Thomas Moser, who
wrote his dissertation under Guerard's
direction at Harvard, remembers him
as a devoted and much-respected
teacher.
"The most striking quality about
him was his warmth and easiness.
There was nothing he wouldn't do for
his students. He was the most popular
teacher in the English Department. I
worshipped him."
Guerard encourages innovative
teaching. "Albert loves change. He's a
terrific idea man," his wife says."He
has even dreamt of starting his own

university, and has playfully drawn up
lists of prospective faculty members."
Since his arrival in 1961, Guerard
has changed several facets of the
English Department. He began the
interdisciplinary program in Modern
Thought and Literature and the
Freshman Seminar Program in 1962.
While he was director of the Freshman
English Program from 1965 to 1967,
Guerard organized the Voice Project,
in which 10 novelists, John Hawkes
among them, experimented with new
ways to teach freshman writing.
Gide Influence
French novelist Andre Gide deeply
influenced Guerard's tendency to
experiment and innovate.
He first met Gide in Paris in 1945,
and began intensively reading his
works two years later when he taught
a course at Harvard on Conrad, Hardy
and Gide.
"I tend not to think that one figure
can change a personality, but what was
left of my puritanical side was pretty
much demolished by Gide. Gide was a
sinuous, playful person. He believed
that everything must be tried. I had
been repressing a lot of anxiety and
sexual termoil. I read every word of
Gide through. As I got into it, it got
more and more intense. I was 32 when
I began to work on Gide. It's unusual
to be changed that late in life."

has even dreamt of starting his own

university, and has playfully drawn up
lists of prospective faculty members."
Since his arrival in 1961, Guerard
has changed several facets of the
English Department. He began the
interdisciplinary program in Modern
Thought and Literature and the
Freshman Seminar Program in 1962.
While he was director of the Freshman
English Program from 1965 to 1967,
Guerard organized the Voice Project,
in which 10 novelists, John Hawkes
among them, experimented with new
ways to teach freshman writing.
Gide Influence
French novelist Andre Gide deeply
influenced Guerard's tendency to
experiment and innovate.
He first met Gide in Paris in 1945,
and began intensively reading his
works two years later when he taught
a course at Harvard on Conrad, Hardy
and Gide.
"I tend not to think that one figure
can change a personality, but what was
left of my puritanical side was pretty
much demolished by Gide. Gide was a
sinuous, playful person. He believed
that everything must be tried. I had
been repressing a lot of anxiety and
sexual termoil. I read every word of
Gide through. As I got into it, it got
more and more intense. I was 32 when
I began to work on Gide. It's unusual
to be changed that late in life."
Politics has always strongly affected
Guerard, and consequently his fiction.

In June, 1959, he left Harvard for
Havana, Port-au-Prince and Cuidad
Trujillo, to study the political
revolutions which had erupted there.
Describing the reasons for his
trip, Guerard wrote in 1972, "To be
away from intellectuals and academic
debate was at least part of my need. I
think I had good reason for seeking
fictional worlds outside our fat and
complacent Eisenhower America, in a
turbulence where most political
choices were matters of life-or-death."
However, the most jarring years for
Guerard were those he spent in France
during World War II as a United States
Intelligence Service (USIS) propaganda
agent.
"I was lying professionally and have
a retrospective feeling of guilt about
that.
"I had left a hardworking academic
environment, and was confronted with
a sordid and comic world. I slowly
began to realize that our liberation of
Europe was a ruinous thing. I had
considerable sympathy with the
Socialist middle, which was being
rubbed out on one side by the
Russians, and on the other side by us."
"Through all these experiences,"
Guerard wrote in Southern Review,
"There persists a distaste for the
grosser manifestations of American
moralism, and power, and a distaste,
too, for classifying whole people as
'the enemy.' "

INNOVATIVE ENGLISH PROFESSOR - Albert Guerard enlivens his classes as
well as his novels with untraditional and experimental ideas sparked by Andre
Gide's writings.
An almost surreal melange of
objects faces the front door inside
English Prof. Albert Guerard's home.
On the hall table sits a stone bust of
Voltaire. Above it hangs a black and
white Impeach-Nixon poster, and on
the floor, a yellow "Under
Construction" sign leans playfully
against the antique table-leg.
The living room is filled with Louis
XVI furniture which seems strangely
at odds with suburban Stanford.
Albert Guerard, novelist, literary
critic and professor at Stanford since
1961, lives in the same house which
his celebrated Parisian father Albert
Leon Guerard occupied while he
taught English at Stanford
(1907-1913; 1924-1945).
"Such in fact, is my very
un-American situation. I find myself
working in his study, my study, across
the hall from where I wrote my first
short stories in 1929," Guerard wrote
in Southern Review.
Some neighbors even claim that
Guerard is even beginning to
physically resemble his father.
Comparing Guerard with his father,
Mary Maclin, his wife, said, "You
could ask Papa any historical fact, and
he could answer you. Albert has very
little sense of history. He is searching
after a greater truth. He is very
creative."
New Methods
Sitting cross-legged in his Stanford
office, Guerard discussed his
forthcoming novel.
"I'm trying something zanier. In
my previous six novels, my writing was
very carefully modulated. I feel
embarrassed about using the methods I
used 15 years ago, because they
definitely seem outmoded. I think you
shouldn't keep writing the same book
all your life. One should change."
Guerard admires anti-realist novelist
John Hawkes more than any other
modern writer. "The very best writers
feel obliged to break the novel form.
Hawkes is one of the few writers who
does his thing regardless of what is

around him. I love his absolute
originality."
Teaching Easier
Teaching comes more easily to
Guerard than writing. "I enjoy
teaching more, because in writing, you
have the agonizing sense of not
knowing if you're going anywhere."
Guerard taught English at Harvard
from 1938 to 1961, and then came to
Stanford.
In his class "The Impressionist and
Experimental Novel," which he taught
fall quarter, Guerard seemed to
converse with his students rather than
lecture to them.
After he asks a question, Guerard
scans the room, moving only his eyes,
looking for a raised hand. When a
student answers, he tilts his head
slightly to the side, listens intently,
and his eyes hardly waver from the
student who is speaking.
Guerard stresses words at almost
rhythmical intervals. When an idea
particularly appeals to him, his rhythm
slows, and his words seem to hang in
mid-air.
Occasionally, he either sweeps his
hands through his gray hair, or thrusts
them into his pockets, where he often
jangles coins or keys.
A former student, junior Craig
Seligman, confirms that "Guerard
respects his students intellectually."
Another student, senior Gene Richie,
credits Guerard with "taking time for
students."
Receptive Teacher
English Prof. Thomas Moser, who
wrote his dissertation under Guerard's
direction at Harvard, remembers him
as a devoted and much-respected
teacher.
"The most striking quality about
him was his warmth and easiness.
There was nothing he wouldn't do for
his students. He was the most popular
teacher in the English Department. I
worshipped him."
Guerard encourages innovative
teaching. "Albert loves change. He's a
terrific idea man," his wife says."He
has even dreamt of starting his own

university, and has playfully drawn up

from 1938 to 1961, and then came to
Stanford.
In his class "The Impressionist and
Experimental Novel," which he taught
fall quarter, Guerard seemed to
converse with his students rather than
lecture to them.
After he asks a question, Guerard
scans the room, moving only his eyes,
looking for a raised hand. When a
student answers, he tilts his head
slightly to the side, listens intently,
and his eyes hardly waver from the
student who is speaking.
Guerard stresses words at almost
rhythmical intervals. When an idea
particularly appeals to him, his rhythm
slows, and his words seem to hang in
mid-air.
Occasionally, he either sweeps his
hands through his gray hair, or thrusts
them into his pockets, where he often
jangles coins or keys.
A former student, junior Craig
Seligman, confirms that "Guerard
respects his students intellectually."
Another student, senior Gene Richie,
credits Guerard with "taking time for
students."
Receptive Teacher
English Prof. Thomas Moser, who
wrote his dissertation under Guerard's
direction at Harvard, remembers him
as a devoted and much-respected
teacher.
"The most striking quality about
him was his warmth and easiness.
There was nothing he wouldn't do for
his students. He was the most popular
teacher in the English Department. I
worshipped him."
Guerard encourages innovative
teaching. "Albert loves change. He's a
terrific idea man," his wife says."He
has even dreamt of starting his own

university, and has playfully drawn up
lists of prospective faculty members."
Since his arrival in 1961, Guerard
has changed several facets of the
English Department. He began the
interdisciplinary program in Modern
Thought and Literature and the
Freshman Seminar Program in 1962.
While he was director of the Freshman
English Program from 1965 to 1967,
Guerard organized the Voice Project,
in which 10 novelists, John Hawkes
among them, experimented with new
ways to teach freshman writing.
Gide Influence
French novelist Andre Gide deeply
influenced Guerard's tendency to
experiment and innovate.
He first met Gide in Paris in 1945,
and began intensively reading his
works two years later when he taught
a course at Harvard on Conrad, Hardy
and Gide.
"I tend not to think that one figure
can change a personality, but what was
left of my puritanical side was pretty
much demolished by Gide. Gide was a
sinuous, playful person. He believed
that everything must be tried. I had
been repressing a lot of anxiety and
sexual termoil. I read every word of
Gide through. As I got into it, it got
more and more intense. I was 32 when
I began to work on Gide. It's unusual
to be changed that late in life."
Politics has always strongly affected
Guerard, and consequently his fiction.

In June, 1959, he left Harvard for
Havana, Port-au-Prince and Cuidad
Trujillo, to study the political
revolutions which had erupted there.
Describing the reasons for his
trip, Guerard wrote in 1972, "To be
away from intellectuals and academic
debate was at least part of my need. I
think I had good reason for seeking
fictional worlds outside our fat and
complacent Eisenhower America, in a
turbulence where most political
choices were matters of life-or-death."
However, the most jarring years for
Guerard were those he spent in France
during World War II as a United States
Intelligence Service (USIS) propaganda
agent.
"I was lying professionally and have
a retrospective feeling of guilt about
that.
"I had left a hardworking academic
environment, and was confronted with
a sordid and comic world. I slowly
began to realize that our liberation of
Europe was a ruinous thing. I had
considerable sympathy with the
Socialist middle, which was being
rubbed out on one side by the
Russians, and on the other side by us."
"Through all these experiences,"
Guerard wrote in Southern Review,
"There persists a distaste for the
grosser manifestations of American
moralism, and power, and a distaste,
too, for classifying whole people as
'the enemy.' "
