# Supplement To Discipline Code Needed
## A 						Faculty Bill Of Rights--Long Overdue 
### 
In the fall of 1972 the Academic
Council debated the proposed faculty
discipline code. The code was sharply
criticized for the absence of definition*
of faculty rights. In response, many
advocates declared their support for a
Bill of Rights and indicated that it
could be written promptly. The
subsequent endorsement of the
discipline code by the Academic
Council was given with the
understanding by many that a Bill of
Rights would shortly be forthcoming.
Now, almost one and one-half years
later, there is no Bill of Rights. An
inadequate draft has been in the
hands of the Academic Senate since
Feb. 1973. It will not be considered
until the spring quarter of 1974.
Recent national and University events
make imperative the rapid adoption of
a strong Bill of Rights at Stanford.
During debate in the Academic
Council last year, the ambiguities and
potential for repression in the
discipline code were clearly identified.
However, supporters rejected the view
that a Bill of Rights should be enacted
simultaneously with a discipline code.
They pleaded for trust in the
administration which, they argued,
would not employ the code
repessively. They denied that it is the
constituents rather than the
administration in whom trust should
be placed.
Some also pleaded for trust in their
support of a Bill of Rights, and for a
brief time period during which the Bill
might be drawn. Since then supporters
of the discipline code have done little
to produce a Bill of Rights and the
administration may oppose it. The
issue of trust has thus become a major
one.
While a Bill of Rights has
languished at Stanford, the same issues
of rights, trust and government
manipulation have emerged on the
national scene. Deception, criminality
and repression have been exposed as
central modes of government. Deceit
has been employed to instigate and
perpetuate the Vietnam war.
Domination and exploitation of the
many for the benefit of a few have
become the modus operandi of the
Nixon administration, witness the
giving and taking of bribes, the
personal enrichment by officials, and
the scandals involving milk, wheat,
energy, prices, industrial cost overruns
and ITT. Democracy is anathema to
the Administration as evidenced by its
efforts to steal the election of 1972,
the infamous Huston Plan and the
intended gutting of the federal Bill of
Rights through the Nixon and Reagan
crime proposals.
The resultant national crisis is the
greatest of recent decades. The
economy and the resources of the
nation are being commandeered for
private rather than public advantage
while the democratic fabric of national
life is under direct assault. Public

perception of the implication of these
developments has grown rapidly; trust
in government, leaders and institutions
has dropped commensurately. But
effective counter-action by citizens has
yet to crystallize.
On a lesser scale, the circumstances
of this University arc similar. For years
the University contributed
substantially to the Vietnam war and
profited mightily thereby, while
asserting that it was merely engaged in
academic work and could not afford
to ' relinquish the money. The
University specifically rejected
responsibility to uphold the Principles
of Nuremberg, which express decades
of effort to limit war.
Without challenge from within the
University, leaders have advocated
suppression of dissent on campus and
private exploitation of the University,
and' have contributed to the Nixon
administration's subversion of
democracy. Democracy in University
function, particularly through the
judicial system, has been denied and
restricted. Critics have been harassed
and eliminated. A potentially
repressive discipline code is in force.
In consequence, both the integrity
and morale of the University have
been diminished. The external
community views this and other
universities with shrinking respect. As
sanctuaries for special privilege,
universities have been found as
wanting in moral fiber as other
"leadership" institutions. On campus
community spirit has ebbed. So too
have collegia! trust and commitment
to the University by its constituents.
Without a guarantee of rights, most
faculty hesitate to support a just cause
relating to the University, or to
organize, for fear of being accused of
interfering with University function.
Untenured faculty in particular are on
notice to be wary.
Such is the state of the University.
An analogy with the national state of
affairs would not be precise, but it
would be meaningfully close.
Events both external and internal
to the University reaffirm an ancient
truism. Those who choose expediency,
who reject humanitarian tradition,
who do not exemplify democratic
values, who do not extend trust and
commitment to their own and other
communities, erode their own
integrity and that of their institution.
That is particularly true of the
university.
Without alliance with democratic
traditions, a university is a
contradiction in terms. The central
subject of a university is knowledge,
and knowledge is both the creation
and the possession of all people a
university which does not recognize
that relationship, immerse itself in the
needs and interests of people of all
types, and stand firm against
arrogation of knowledge for private
gain and privilege, forfeits its claim to

sustenance from the community in
which it exists.
It is argued that the university is
different from other social
institutions, that it requires and can
achieve isolation. This is false. Recent
years have reaffirmed, and Stanford
exemplifies, that the university is not
and cannot be isolated. It experiences
precisely the afflictions and needs of
surrounding society. Its function as an
educational institutions requires that it
identify with and express the deepest
humanitarian values. At stake is its
soul.
Education and domination are
opposites. Genuine learning requires
openness and trust, free of
manipulation. Stanford has profited
from harm to others. It has distrusted
and manipulated its constituents, and
restricted democracy. To that extent it
is not a genuine educational

Halsted Holman

institution. To put it right is our
responsibility.
A Bill of Rights, ultimately
extended to the entire Stanford
community, is an essential step. It
would stimulate and guard the
re-emergence of ideas. It would foster
new paths for the University and
would inhibit capricious retribution. It
would contribute to a sense of
community and of mission.
Rights are not bestowed. They are
inherent. Historically they have been
suppressed unless they were asserted.
Just as action is essential now by
citizens to defend and assert their
rights if this nation is to survive and
grow as a democracy, so it is essential
if this University is to be a true
educational institution. The nation
and the university are what we make
them, nothinf more or less.

would contribute to a sense of

Rights are not bestowed. They are
inherent. Historically they have been
suppressed unless they were asserted.
Just as action is essential now by
citizens to defend and assert their
rights if this nation is to survive and
grow as a democracy, so it is essential
if this University is to be a true
educational institution. The nation
and the university are what we make
them, nothinf more or less.

In the fall of 1972 the Academic
Council debated the proposed faculty
discipline code. The code was sharply
criticized for the absence of definition*
of faculty rights. In response, many
advocates declared their support for a
Bill of Rights and indicated that it
could be written promptly. The
subsequent endorsement of the
discipline code by the Academic
Council was given with the
understanding by many that a Bill of
Rights would shortly be forthcoming.
Now, almost one and one-half years
later, there is no Bill of Rights. An
inadequate draft has been in the
hands of the Academic Senate since
Feb. 1973. It will not be considered
until the spring quarter of 1974.
Recent national and University events
make imperative the rapid adoption of
a strong Bill of Rights at Stanford.
During debate in the Academic
Council last year, the ambiguities and
potential for repression in the
discipline code were clearly identified.
However, supporters rejected the view
that a Bill of Rights should be enacted
simultaneously with a discipline code.
They pleaded for trust in the
administration which, they argued,
would not employ the code
repessively. They denied that it is the
constituents rather than the
administration in whom trust should
be placed.
Some also pleaded for trust in their
support of a Bill of Rights, and for a
brief time period during which the Bill
might be drawn. Since then supporters
of the discipline code have done little
to produce a Bill of Rights and the
administration may oppose it. The
issue of trust has thus become a major
one.
While a Bill of Rights has
languished at Stanford, the same issues
of rights, trust and government
manipulation have emerged on the
national scene. Deception, criminality
and repression have been exposed as
central modes of government. Deceit
has been employed to instigate and
perpetuate the Vietnam war.
Domination and exploitation of the
many for the benefit of a few have
become the modus operandi of the
Nixon administration, witness the
giving and taking of bribes, the
personal enrichment by officials, and
the scandals involving milk, wheat,
energy, prices, industrial cost overruns
and ITT. Democracy is anathema to
the Administration as evidenced by its
efforts to steal the election of 1972,
the infamous Huston Plan and the
intended gutting of the federal Bill of
Rights through the Nixon and Reagan
crime proposals.
The resultant national crisis is the
greatest of recent decades. The
economy and the resources of the
nation are being commandeered for
private rather than public advantage
while the democratic fabric of national
life is under direct assault. Public

perception of the implication of these
developments has grown rapidly; trust
in government, leaders and institutions
has dropped commensurately. But
effective counter-action by citizens has
yet to crystallize.
On a lesser scale, the circumstances
of this University arc similar. For years
the University contributed
substantially to the Vietnam war and
profited mightily thereby, while
asserting that it was merely engaged in
academic work and could not afford
to ' relinquish the money. The
University specifically rejected
responsibility to uphold the Principles
of Nuremberg, which express decades
of effort to limit war.
Without challenge from within the
University, leaders have advocated
suppression of dissent on campus and
private exploitation of the University,
and' have contributed to the Nixon
administration's subversion of
democracy. Democracy in University
function, particularly through the
judicial system, has been denied and
restricted. Critics have been harassed
and eliminated. A potentially
repressive discipline code is in force.
In consequence, both the integrity
and morale of the University have
been diminished. The external
community views this and other
universities with shrinking respect. As
sanctuaries for special privilege,
universities have been found as
wanting in moral fiber as other
"leadership" institutions. On campus
community spirit has ebbed. So too
have collegia! trust and commitment
to the University by its constituents.
Without a guarantee of rights, most
faculty hesitate to support a just cause
relating to the University, or to
organize, for fear of being accused of
interfering with University function.
Untenured faculty in particular are on
notice to be wary.
Such is the state of the University.
An analogy with the national state of
affairs would not be precise, but it
would be meaningfully close.
Events both external and internal
to the University reaffirm an ancient
truism. Those who choose expediency,
who reject humanitarian tradition,
who do not exemplify democratic
values, who do not extend trust and
commitment to their own and other
communities, erode their own
integrity and that of their institution.
That is particularly true of the
university.
Without alliance with democratic
traditions, a university is a
contradiction in terms. The central
subject of a university is knowledge,
and knowledge is both the creation
and the possession of all people a
university which does not recognize
that relationship, immerse itself in the
needs and interests of people of all
types, and stand firm against
arrogation of knowledge for private
gain and privilege, forfeits its claim to

sustenance from the community in
which it exists.
It is argued that the university is
different from other social
institutions, that it requires and can
achieve isolation. This is false. Recent
years have reaffirmed, and Stanford
exemplifies, that the university is not
and cannot be isolated. It experiences
precisely the afflictions and needs of
surrounding society. Its function as an
educational institutions requires that it
identify with and express the deepest
humanitarian values. At stake is its
soul.
Education and domination are
opposites. Genuine learning requires
openness and trust, free of
manipulation. Stanford has profited
from harm to others. It has distrusted
and manipulated its constituents, and
restricted democracy. To that extent it
is not a genuine educational

Halsted Holman

institution. To put it right is our
responsibility.
A Bill of Rights, ultimately
extended to the entire Stanford
community, is an essential step. It
would stimulate and guard the
re-emergence of ideas. It would foster
new paths for the University and
would inhibit capricious retribution. It
would contribute to a sense of
community and of mission.

surrounding society. Its function as an
educational institutions requires that it
identify with and express the deepest
humanitarian values. At stake is its
soul.
Education and domination are
opposites. Genuine learning requires
openness and trust, free of
manipulation. Stanford has profited
from harm to others. It has distrusted
and manipulated its constituents, and
restricted democracy. To that extent it
is not a genuine educational

institution. To put it right is our

A Bill of Rights, ultimately
extended to the entire Stanford
community, is an essential step. It
would stimulate and guard the
re-emergence of ideas. It would foster
new paths for the University and
would inhibit capricious retribution. It
would contribute to a sense of
community and of mission.
Rights are not bestowed. They are
inherent. Historically they have been
suppressed unless they were asserted.
Just as action is essential now by
citizens to defend and assert their
rights if this nation is to survive and
grow as a democracy, so it is essential
if this University is to be a true
educational institution. The nation
and the university are what we make
them, nothinf more or less.

In the fall of 1972 the Academic
Council debated the proposed faculty
discipline code. The code was sharply
criticized for the absence of definition*
of faculty rights. In response, many
advocates declared their support for a
Bill of Rights and indicated that it
could be written promptly. The
subsequent endorsement of the
discipline code by the Academic
Council was given with the
understanding by many that a Bill of
Rights would shortly be forthcoming.
Now, almost one and one-half years
later, there is no Bill of Rights. An
inadequate draft has been in the
hands of the Academic Senate since
Feb. 1973. It will not be considered
until the spring quarter of 1974.
Recent national and University events
make imperative the rapid adoption of
a strong Bill of Rights at Stanford.
During debate in the Academic
Council last year, the ambiguities and
potential for repression in the
discipline code were clearly identified.
However, supporters rejected the view
that a Bill of Rights should be enacted
simultaneously with a discipline code.
They pleaded for trust in the
administration which, they argued,
would not employ the code
repessively. They denied that it is the
constituents rather than the
administration in whom trust should
be placed.
Some also pleaded for trust in their
support of a Bill of Rights, and for a
brief time period during which the Bill
might be drawn. Since then supporters
of the discipline code have done little
to produce a Bill of Rights and the
administration may oppose it. The
issue of trust has thus become a major
one.
While a Bill of Rights has
languished at Stanford, the same issues
of rights, trust and government
manipulation have emerged on the
national scene. Deception, criminality
and repression have been exposed as
central modes of government. Deceit
has been employed to instigate and
perpetuate the Vietnam war.
Domination and exploitation of the
many for the benefit of a few have
become the modus operandi of the
Nixon administration, witness the
giving and taking of bribes, the
personal enrichment by officials, and
the scandals involving milk, wheat,
energy, prices, industrial cost overruns
and ITT. Democracy is anathema to
the Administration as evidenced by its
efforts to steal the election of 1972,
the infamous Huston Plan and the
intended gutting of the federal Bill of
Rights through the Nixon and Reagan
crime proposals.
The resultant national crisis is the
greatest of recent decades. The
economy and the resources of the
nation are being commandeered for
private rather than public advantage
while the democratic fabric of national
life is under direct assault. Public

perception of the implication of these
developments has grown rapidly; trust
in government, leaders and institutions
has dropped commensurately. But
effective counter-action by citizens has
yet to crystallize.
On a lesser scale, the circumstances
of this University arc similar. For years
the University contributed
substantially to the Vietnam war and
profited mightily thereby, while
asserting that it was merely engaged in
academic work and could not afford
to ' relinquish the money. The
University specifically rejected
responsibility to uphold the Principles
of Nuremberg, which express decades
of effort to limit war.
Without challenge from within the
University, leaders have advocated
suppression of dissent on campus and
private exploitation of the University,
and' have contributed to the Nixon
administration's subversion of
democracy. Democracy in University
function, particularly through the
judicial system, has been denied and
restricted. Critics have been harassed
and eliminated. A potentially
repressive discipline code is in force.
In consequence, both the integrity
and morale of the University have
been diminished. The external
community views this and other
universities with shrinking respect. As
sanctuaries for special privilege,
universities have been found as
wanting in moral fiber as other
"leadership" institutions. On campus
community spirit has ebbed. So too
have collegia! trust and commitment
to the University by its constituents.
Without a guarantee of rights, most
faculty hesitate to support a just cause
relating to the University, or to
organize, for fear of being accused of
interfering with University function.
Untenured faculty in particular are on
notice to be wary.
Such is the state of the University.
An analogy with the national state of
affairs would not be precise, but it
would be meaningfully close.
Events both external and internal
to the University reaffirm an ancient
truism. Those who choose expediency,
who reject humanitarian tradition,
who do not exemplify democratic
values, who do not extend trust and
commitment to their own and other
communities, erode their own
integrity and that of their institution.
That is particularly true of the
university.
Without alliance with democratic
traditions, a university is a
contradiction in terms. The central
subject of a university is knowledge,
and knowledge is both the creation
and the possession of all people a
university which does not recognize
that relationship, immerse itself in the
needs and interests of people of all
types, and stand firm against
arrogation of knowledge for private
gain and privilege, forfeits its claim to

sustenance from the community in
which it exists.
It is argued that the university is
different from other social
institutions, that it requires and can
achieve isolation. This is false. Recent
years have reaffirmed, and Stanford
exemplifies, that the university is not
and cannot be isolated. It experiences
precisely the afflictions and needs of
surrounding society. Its function as an
educational institutions requires that it
identify with and express the deepest
humanitarian values. At stake is its
soul.
Education and domination are

openness and trust, free of

and knowledge is both the creation
and the possession of all people a
university which does not recognize
that relationship, immerse itself in the
needs and interests of people of all
types, and stand firm against
arrogation of knowledge for private
gain and privilege, forfeits its claim to

sustenance from the community in
which it exists.
It is argued that the university is
different from other social
institutions, that it requires and can
achieve isolation. This is false. Recent
years have reaffirmed, and Stanford
exemplifies, that the university is not
and cannot be isolated. It experiences
precisely the afflictions and needs of
surrounding society. Its function as an
educational institutions requires that it
identify with and express the deepest
humanitarian values. At stake is its
soul.
Education and domination are
opposites. Genuine learning requires
openness and trust, free of
manipulation. Stanford has profited
from harm to others. It has distrusted
and manipulated its constituents, and
restricted democracy. To that extent it
is not a genuine educational

institution. To put it right is our
responsibility.
A Bill of Rights, ultimately
extended to the entire Stanford
community, is an essential step. It
would stimulate and guard the
re-emergence of ideas. It would foster
new paths for the University and
would inhibit capricious retribution. It
would contribute to a sense of
community and of mission.
Rights are not bestowed. They are
inherent. Historically they have been
suppressed unless they were asserted.
Just as action is essential now by
citizens to defend and assert their
rights if this nation is to survive and
grow as a democracy, so it is essential
if this University is to be a true
educational institution. The nation
and the university are what we make
them, nothinf more or less.
