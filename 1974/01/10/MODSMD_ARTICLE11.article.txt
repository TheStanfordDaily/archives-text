Clarification of Rosaldo Article
Editor:
I would like to comment on the
charges of "irresponsible journalism"
and "inaccurate reporting" levelled on
the profile of Prof. Renato Rosaldo in
the Daily. I do not think that the
article was "patronizing" toward the
Ilongots. Almost all of the piece dealt
with friendship and with the learning
experiences the Rosaldos had during
their stay in the Phillipines.
As for the use of the word
"headhunter," I was led to understand
that the Ilongots do practice this
custom and that this is one reason that
most Westerners stay away from their
territory. In any case, very little of the
article dealt with "headhunting."
The other charge, that of having
patronized Prof. Michelle Rosaldo, is
perhaps more justified and one that
bothers me more. I wanted to show
that there was a prejudice at the time
against husband-wife joint
professorships, not that Prof. M.
Rosaldo needed any professional
leeway to gain her position. Had I had
more time, I would have done an
article on both Rosaldos and given
them equal time. Unfortunately, I was
only familiar with Prof. R. Rosaldo's
work and for this reason focused
entirely on him. Perhaps the word
"wringing" is inaccurate and
misleading. If it is, then I apologize to
Prof. M. Rosaldo for the unintended
slur on her abilities.

Tresidder Program Board
JEditor:
Applications for positions on the
new Tresidder Program Board are now
available to students.
The Board is being formed this
quarter. Its responsibilities will include
all programming functions at Tresidder
Union. The Board will work closely
with the Programs Manager in
determining what kinds of programs
will take place at Tresidder. It will be a
working board, not just an advisory
one. The members will actively
participate in the initiation,
organization, execution, and
evaluation of all aspects of
programming. The projects the Board
will be involved with are: film series,
panel discussions, lectures, dances, etc.
Our goal is to make Tresidder a real
community center â€” an open forum
for the expression of a wide variety of
ideas and interests. The Program Board
will have a major role in this effort. If
we are to succeed, we will need the
active involvement of students
representing a broad spectrum of
interests.
Applications are available in the
Campus Affairs Office, room 253 on
the second floor of Tresidder. The
deadline for submitting them is 5:00
p.m. Wednesday, January 16. If you
have any questions or want more
information call extension 3542.

Programs Manager
