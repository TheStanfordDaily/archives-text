# 'Gas-By-Number' Begins In Oregon
## 
### 
SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Oregon
officials have come up with a sort
of gasoline-by-number plan in an
effort to assure all motorists of a
fair chance to get fuel, despite
shortages.
The plan, which takes effect
Monday on a voluntary basis,
involves license plates and the
calendar.
It limits motorists with
even-numbered license plates to
gasoline purchases on
even-numbered calendar days
during the week. Motorists with
odd-numbered plates get to buy
on crdd-numbered days.
Saturdays are an exception. To
avoid disrupting the recreation
industry, the plan provides that
anyone can buy gas on Saturday.
Sundays also are a sort of
exception because most of the
stations have been closed anyway
as a conservation move.
There are other special rules
involving emergency vehicles,
salesmen, out-of-state drivers and
people with license plates that
have letters instead of numbers.
The plan was worked out by
representatives of Gov. Tom
McCall and the state's 2700
service stations. It was approved
by station owner representatives
Tuesday night.
Right now, the plan's success
depends on the cooperation of the
station operators and the public,

but McCall said, "There will be a
mandatory program if this doesn't
work."
Another provision of the
Oregon plan prohibits purchases
by motorists who already have
more than half a tank of gasoline.
Dealers estimate that 25 to 30
percent of the cars they serve have
been buying less than $2 worth of
gasoline — some getting as little as
a gallon to keep their tanks full.
They say that kind of panic
buying just makes the shortage
worse. Federal officials say panic
buying may have accounted for
10 million gallons of gasoline in
Oregon in recent weeks.
The state has been particularly
hard hit by the gasoline shortage
and some January deliveries were
made ahead of schedule in an
effort to ease the situation during
the New Year's holiday period.
