## 
### 
A 15-minute movie produced by a 19-year-old Stanford sophomore
has won an honorable mention in the senior category of the eleventh
annual Kodak Teenage Movie Awards.
Steven Fierberg of Birmingham, Michigan, and hometown
co-producer William Meyer, a Princeton University sophomore, will
receive a certificate from Eastman Kodak Company in recognition of
the film, "The Geranium." It emerged as a winner in competition with
films entered by Bmm and super 8 movie-makers, age 16 through 19,
from throughout the United States and Canada.
The super 8 color film, with sound on magnetic stripe, is a
melodrama about a girl discarded by her boyfriend. She nurtures a
dying plant back to health only to discard the plant for a new
boyfriend.
"We wanted to make a smooth, visually beautiful film before the
end of summer," notes Fierberg, who says he spent 150 hours on the
production before he stopped counting. "I found an idea in a
magazine that I changed and developed into a suitable screenplay. The
movie was a learning experience, too. We tried new ideas and
techniques and gained more practice in previously developed skills."
