# 'No Liberating Experience'
## Feminist Tells Evolution 
### JULIE FAGAN 
"There was no conscious
liberating experience for me; I
simply did what I wanted to, and
didn't think of it as particularly
revolutionary," explains Assoc.
English Prof. Wendy Martin,
visiting from Queens College, New
York. She discusses the evolution
of her feminist consciousness,
which is not militantly overstated,
but evident all the same.
Maritn will expand more fully
on her ideas in a course this
quarter, "The Feminine Mystique
and American Fiction."
In her studies as an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley and
as a graduate student at UC-Davis,
Martin discovered "there are
female traditions in literature that
men just don't see." She plans to
build the course around this
theme.
The readings she has selected
include Nathaniel Hawthorne's
The Blithedale Romance, Sylvia
Plath's The Bell Jar, Willa Cather's
My Mortal Enemy, and Ernest
Hemingway's A Farewell To
Arms.
Many of these books illustrate
public condemnation of
stereotyped American heroines
who deviate from the behavior
expected of them in a world
dominated by males. Each
individual author displays a
different perspective, however.
"In addition, I will emphasize
women's search for identity and
an independent sense of self," she
says."I think it is important that
women feel they are as capable as
men of finding fulfilling lifelong
work that won't stop when they
get married and raise families."
Consistent with this
philosophy, Martin has persevered
despite bleak job prospects, and
obtained a university teaching
position at Queens College, where
she has taught for the past five
years. She says she has always
wanted to teach university
students, although her professors
repeatedly tried to direct her
towards an elementary or high

school teaching career.
"One of the worst drawbacks
for my generation was the lack of
female models in positions of
conspicuous responsibility at the
university level. There were
practically no women professors
at either Berkeley or Davis when I
was a student," she explained.
For this reason, she is eager to
advise Stanford women: "I would
like undergraduate and graduate
women who are interested in
women's studies or the special
problems of women in the
university to know that I am
available for conferences and
discussion, and that I would very
much like an opportunity to share
my knowledge and experiences
with Stanford women."
She extends this invitation to
all women, not just English
students. She edits Women's
Studies: An Interdisciplinary
Journal, and is acquainted with
women's problems in various areas
of study.
Martin feels a "tremendous
state of flux" generates tension in
many aspects of American life
today, affecting institutions such
as education and marriage.

"I feel education should be a
lifelong process, and I think adult
education will become very
important in the next few years.
The definition of education itself
is in the process of changing, so
that a university will someday
include students of all ages," she
says.
Although herself unmarried,
Martin is optimistic about the
survival of marriage as an
institution. "I think we're
currently undergoing a period of
acute stress with respect to
marriage," she stated.
"I feel the reason that the
divorce rate is so high right now is
that women, no longer dependent
on men for economic reasons,
now rely more heavily on them
for personal needs. Once we're
over this awkward transition
period, and people change their
expectations of marriage, it will
become an enjoyable state."
"To me, an 'ideal' marriage
would include a merging of the
wife's traditionally private
domestic world with the
husband's more public, active one,
and a mutual sharing of their
experiences and responsibilities."

conspicuous responsibility at the
university level. There were
practically no women professors
at either Berkeley or Davis when I
was a student," she explained.
For this reason, she is eager to
advise Stanford women: "I would
like undergraduate and graduate
women who are interested in
women's studies or the special
problems of women in the
university to know that I am
available for conferences and
discussion, and that I would very
much like an opportunity to share
my knowledge and experiences
with Stanford women."
She extends this invitation to
all women, not just English
students. She edits Women's
Studies: An Interdisciplinary
Journal, and is acquainted with
women's problems in various areas
of study.
Martin feels a "tremendous
state of flux" generates tension in
many aspects of American life
today, affecting institutions such
as education and marriage.

"I feel education should be a
lifelong process, and I think adult
education will become very
important in the next few years.
The definition of education itself
is in the process of changing, so
that a university will someday
include students of all ages," she
says.
Although herself unmarried,
Martin is optimistic about the
survival of marriage as an
institution. "I think we're
currently undergoing a period of
acute stress with respect to
marriage," she stated.
"I feel the reason that the
divorce rate is so high right now is
that women, no longer dependent
on men for economic reasons,
now rely more heavily on them
for personal needs. Once we're
over this awkward transition
period, and people change their
expectations of marriage, it will
become an enjoyable state."
"To me, an 'ideal' marriage
would include a merging of the
wife's traditionally private
domestic world with the
husband's more public, active one,
and a mutual sharing of their
experiences and responsibilities."
"There was no conscious
liberating experience for me; I
simply did what I wanted to, and
didn't think of it as particularly
revolutionary," explains Assoc.
English Prof. Wendy Martin,
visiting from Queens College, New
York. She discusses the evolution
of her feminist consciousness,
which is not militantly overstated,
but evident all the same.
Maritn will expand more fully
on her ideas in a course this
quarter, "The Feminine Mystique
and American Fiction."
In her studies as an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley and
as a graduate student at UC-Davis,
Martin discovered "there are
female traditions in literature that
men just don't see." She plans to
build the course around this
theme.
The readings she has selected
include Nathaniel Hawthorne's
The Blithedale Romance, Sylvia
Plath's The Bell Jar, Willa Cather's
My Mortal Enemy, and Ernest
Hemingway's A Farewell To
Arms.
Many of these books illustrate
public condemnation of
stereotyped American heroines
who deviate from the behavior
expected of them in a world
dominated by males. Each
individual author displays a
different perspective, however.
"In addition, I will emphasize
women's search for identity and
an independent sense of self," she
says."I think it is important that
women feel they are as capable as
men of finding fulfilling lifelong
work that won't stop when they
get married and raise families."
Consistent with this
philosophy, Martin has persevered
despite bleak job prospects, and
obtained a university teaching
position at Queens College, where
she has taught for the past five
years. She says she has always
wanted to teach university
students, although her professors
repeatedly tried to direct her
towards an elementary or high

school teaching career.
"One of the worst drawbacks
for my generation was the lack of
female models in positions of
conspicuous responsibility at the
university level. There were
practically no women professors
at either Berkeley or Davis when I
was a student," she explained.
