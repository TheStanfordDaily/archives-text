# Knapp Eyes McCloskey's House Seat
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
J. Gordon Knapp, the conservative
Atherton businessman who mounted a
hasty write-in campaign for
Congressman Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey's seat two years ago, is
running again.
Only this time he's starting early —
and planning to beat McCloskey in the
Republican primary this June.
Knapp has made no formal
announcement of candidacy, but his
spokesmen freely admit he's running.
Knapp, McCloskey, and possibly other
Republican hopefuls will vie for
nomination in the newly
reapportioned seventeenth district,
which includes Stanford, Palo Alto,
and surrounding areas.
Knapp's well-financed campaign —
"Money is not one of his major
concerns," a spokesman said, and the
budget for the primary campaign is
over $100,000 — will attempt to
appeal to what Knapp partisans believe
is widespread Republican
disenchantment with McCloskey.
McCloskey, who opposed President
Nixon in several Republican
presidential primaries in 1972, has
spoken widely in favor of the
President's impeachment.
In the 1972 Congressional primary,
McCloskey's two opponents — both of
whom identified themselves as
"conservatives" — won a majority of
the vote, but McCloskey won the
nomination with a plurality of 44
percent.
"I think I'm more in tune with
local issues than Congressman
McCloskey is," Knapp told the Daily
yesterday. "He's more
nationally-oriented. I'm more
concerned about finding solutions to
problems; I wouldn't be out fanning
disenchantment.
"I have great respect for
Congressman McCloskey — I think he's
probably the most articulate and
personally attractive candidate — but
he vacillates on issues many times. He
picks a rising tide and rides in on the
waves."
Knapp said he believes the most
important issue before the voters is "a
confidence factor." He does not
expect the Watergate scandal to affect
this year's elections severely, however.
"Watergate is a fast-falling star," he
said. "It's going down quickly in the
public mind. The issue that's next,
coming down the stream, is the
inflationary spiral . . . We've got to get
rid of price and wage controls, and let
the economy return to its proper level.
But I think we're in for four or five
agonizing years."
Knapp said he didn't wish to
"prejudge" President Nixon's
resignation, but said while confidence
in the Presidency has been
"shattered," it hasn't affected local
Republican fundraising.
Knapp plans to announce his
candidacy "in a few weeks." a
spokesman said. "We don't consider
the Stanford campus one of our
bedrock areas of support," the
inokesman noted wryly.
