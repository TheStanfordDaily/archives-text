# Stanford's Literary Magazine
## Latest 'Sequoia' Proves 'Enjoyable' 
### PAULETTE BATES 
Donna Lee's "Story" in the
Fall issue of Stanford's literary
magazine, Sequoia, is not your
basic girl meets boy tale; for this
is the story of Ethyl the
Outrageous (real name Brooks),
one of the "saints of the street
queens" and idol of the Midnight
Show at the Threatre of
Nocturnal Dreams, who one night
encounters Alice, the narrator,
while fighting over a satin dress in
a goodwill box. He wins because
he looks better in it.
Ethyl glitters with his sequins,
tinsel, his curly pink wig and silver
lame Aztec Indian outfit. Alice,
on the other hand, is not exactly
the sort to turn up in a tailored
tweed suit: she wears an 1890
swimsuit with bloomers, a pleated
top, a plastic flower swim cap,
with a ducky inner tube gracing
her waist. Also flippers. Thus
begins a beautiful thing.
Exotic Subject Matter
Although there is plenty here
just in terms of exotic subject
matter to hold most folks interest,
there is more, for Donna Lee's
prose is as sharp as her characters
are flaming. Much of the effect is
achieved through dialogue, which
is appropriately affected, rich
with the inflections suggesting the
outrageous, the funny, the snide,
the funky "in" language of people
like Chaste Waist and Bobby
Buns.
"I am plucked," said Rita.
"You two act like you're married.
Don't either of you turn tricks
anymore?" The descriptions are
often comic. When Alice is fired
from the clothing boutique where
she works, the pretty boys there
"hugged me and pouted and told
me to steal something." When
Ethyl calls Alice at her boarding

house, the next door neighbor
who answers the hall phone says,
"It's a gentleman caller." Well,
yes
The story is accompanied by a
color reproduction of Lynn Esta
Goldman's painting, "Variations
on David Bowie," who just made
the Worst Dressed Women of '73
list. Sequoia has some fine art
work this issue. Besides Bowie,
there are some black and white
works of Devin Dougherty,
including an especially nice
drawing of a nude, with the
unusual perspective of being
slightly lower than the retreating
figure, so that the hips dominate
the focus.
If the exotic per se is often
enough to capture and hold our
interest, fiction dealing with the
mundane has the added problem
of counteracting the dullness of
the world it is attempting to
explore. Written as a monologue,
which can be one of the most
interesting of fictional devices,
"The Fat Lady" by Joanne Jacobs
is the review of a life which has
culminated in a present in which
the most compelling activity is to
suck apart the peanut in an
m & m, or perhaps, to eat around
the chips on a chocolate chip
cookie.
There are some good lines here,
such as the description of her sex
life: "But it changed after we
were married. Joe would be tired
from working overtime and it got
to be like we were just anybody
doing it, not ourselves." Or, the
daughter who has "three children,
a boy and two girls, whose first
words were 'No, thank you.'"

But on the whole one can never
feel very involved with the
character. Joanne Jacobs can
write, but "The Fat Lady" is
ultimately defeated by the dead
weight of her character and her
dull existence.
Reverberating Locksmith
Ron Slate's poem
"Locksmith," also a monologue,
demonstrates the ability of a
metaphor to expand and
reverberate. Listen to the voice of
the locksmith: "What I hoped for
them I was what I once wanted/
for myself: something like a final/
room of certainty." The closing
view is that of the locksmith in his
darkening shop, toying with a
crossword, "stamping my foot/
when baffled like a man/ unable
to enter/ his own home." With its
lock and keys, the poem manages
to suggest more than can be
translated into a literal meaning,
and ends on a haunting note.
Sheridan Crawford's poem
"For My Old Man" is an elegy to
LBJ on his death. "I slipped you
off, this bright empty day,/ You
slipped out without a word, the
only surviving one —/ I dreamed
you straddling a milking stool,
ranch hand,/ 'Mr. Big Man' .. .
Full of odd insistent rhythms and
rhymes, the poem becomes a sort
of berating praise, a begrudged
tribute from a Texas daughter.
The caricature of LBJ by Mark
Rathbun is marvelous.
My favorite of Bob Weston's
four poems is the carefully
phrased "Old Dog." "Though he
lingers at the edge/ Of things, his
old head lifts in faint surprise/
Each time I call, as though I

brought him back/ Upon a scene
grown slowly unfamiliar." Barbara
Glenn expresses artfully the
nature of poetry in "Poem." "A
crystal snare to catch the light,/
The thought that time and talk
obscure —/ This prism breaks to
black on white/ The gray on gray
of what we were."
The Fall. issue of Sequoia
includes four fiction pieces, work
by several artists, and a selection
of thirteen poets. The issue itself
is pleasing in* its composition — a
balanced, interesting combination
of serious work.
A small magazine such as
Sequoia is intrinsically worthwhile
because of its accessibility to the
community, its introduction of
developing talent, its existence as
a purely artistic venture. The Fall
issue of Sequoia has all of these
qualities, plus the final necessary
criterion for success: good writing
enjoyable to read.

feel very involved with the
character. Joanne Jacobs can
write, but "The Fat Lady" is
ultimately defeated by the dead
weight of her character and her
dull existence.
Reverberating Locksmith
Ron Slate's poem
"Locksmith," also a monologue,
demonstrates the ability of a
metaphor to expand and
reverberate. Listen to the voice of
the locksmith: "What I hoped for
them I was what I once wanted/
for myself: something like a final/
room of certainty." The closing
view is that of the locksmith in his
darkening shop, toying with a
crossword, "stamping my foot/
when baffled like a man/ unable
to enter/ his own home." With its
lock and keys, the poem manages
to suggest more than can be
translated into a literal meaning,
and ends on a haunting note.
Sheridan Crawford's poem
"For My Old Man" is an elegy to
LBJ on his death. "I slipped you
off, this bright empty day,/ You
slipped out without a word, the
only surviving one —/ I dreamed
you straddling a milking stool,
ranch hand,/ 'Mr. Big Man' .. .
Full of odd insistent rhythms and
rhymes, the poem becomes a sort
of berating praise, a begrudged
tribute from a Texas daughter.
The caricature of LBJ by Mark
Rathbun is marvelous.
My favorite of Bob Weston's
four poems is the carefully
phrased "Old Dog." "Though he
lingers at the edge/ Of things, his
old head lifts in faint surprise/
Each time I call, as though I

brought him back/ Upon a scene
grown slowly unfamiliar." Barbara
Glenn expresses artfully the
nature of poetry in "Poem." "A
crystal snare to catch the light,/
The thought that time and talk
obscure —/ This prism breaks to
black on white/ The gray on gray
of what we were."
The Fall. issue of Sequoia
includes four fiction pieces, work
by several artists, and a selection
of thirteen poets. The issue itself
is pleasing in* its composition — a
balanced, interesting combination
of serious work.
A small magazine such as
Sequoia is intrinsically worthwhile
because of its accessibility to the
community, its introduction of
developing talent, its existence as
a purely artistic venture. The Fall
issue of Sequoia has all of these
qualities, plus the final necessary
criterion for success: good writing
enjoyable to read.
(Paulette Bates teaches in the
Creative Writing Department.)
Donna Lee's "Story" in the
Fall issue of Stanford's literary
magazine, Sequoia, is not your
basic girl meets boy tale; for this
is the story of Ethyl the
Outrageous (real name Brooks),
one of the "saints of the street
queens" and idol of the Midnight
Show at the Threatre of
Nocturnal Dreams, who one night
encounters Alice, the narrator,
while fighting over a satin dress in
a goodwill box. He wins because
he looks better in it.
Ethyl glitters with his sequins,
tinsel, his curly pink wig and silver
lame Aztec Indian outfit. Alice,
on the other hand, is not exactly
the sort to turn up in a tailored
tweed suit: she wears an 1890
swimsuit with bloomers, a pleated
top, a plastic flower swim cap,
with a ducky inner tube gracing
her waist. Also flippers. Thus
begins a beautiful thing.
Exotic Subject Matter
Although there is plenty here
just in terms of exotic subject
matter to hold most folks interest,
there is more, for Donna Lee's
prose is as sharp as her characters
are flaming. Much of the effect is
achieved through dialogue, which
is appropriately affected, rich
with the inflections suggesting the
outrageous, the funny, the snide,
the funky "in" language of people
like Chaste Waist and Bobby
Buns.
"I am plucked," said Rita.
"You two act like you're married.
Don't either of you turn tricks
anymore?" The descriptions are
often comic. When Alice is fired
from the clothing boutique where
she works, the pretty boys there
"hugged me and pouted and told
me to steal something." When
Ethyl calls Alice at her boarding

house, the next door neighbor
who answers the hall phone says,
"It's a gentleman caller." Well,
yes
The story is accompanied by a
color reproduction of Lynn Esta
Goldman's painting, "Variations
on David Bowie," who just made
the Worst Dressed Women of '73
list. Sequoia has some fine art
work this issue. Besides Bowie,
there are some black and white
works of Devin Dougherty,
including an especially nice
drawing of a nude, with the
unusual perspective of being
slightly lower than the retreating
figure, so that the hips dominate
the focus.
If the exotic per se is often
enough to capture and hold our
interest, fiction dealing with the
mundane has the added problem
of counteracting the dullness of
the world it is attempting to
explore. Written as a monologue,
which can be one of the most
interesting of fictional devices,
"The Fat Lady" by Joanne Jacobs
is the review of a life which has
culminated in a present in which
the most compelling activity is to
suck apart the peanut in an
m & m, or perhaps, to eat around
the chips on a chocolate chip
cookie.
There are some good lines here,
such as the description of her sex
life: "But it changed after we
were married. Joe would be tired
from working overtime and it got
to be like we were just anybody
doing it, not ourselves." Or, the
daughter who has "three children,
a boy and two girls, whose first
words were 'No, thank you.'"

But on the whole one can never
feel very involved with the
character. Joanne Jacobs can
write, but "The Fat Lady" is
ultimately defeated by the dead

her waist. Also flippers. Thus
begins a beautiful thing.
Exotic Subject Matter
Although there is plenty here
just in terms of exotic subject
matter to hold most folks interest,
there is more, for Donna Lee's
prose is as sharp as her characters
are flaming. Much of the effect is
achieved through dialogue, which
is appropriately affected, rich
with the inflections suggesting the
outrageous, the funny, the snide,
the funky "in" language of people
like Chaste Waist and Bobby
Buns.
"I am plucked," said Rita.
"You two act like you're married.
Don't either of you turn tricks
anymore?" The descriptions are
often comic. When Alice is fired
from the clothing boutique where
she works, the pretty boys there
"hugged me and pouted and told
me to steal something." When
Ethyl calls Alice at her boarding

house, the next door neighbor
who answers the hall phone says,
"It's a gentleman caller." Well,
yes
The story is accompanied by a
color reproduction of Lynn Esta
Goldman's painting, "Variations
on David Bowie," who just made
the Worst Dressed Women of '73
list. Sequoia has some fine art
work this issue. Besides Bowie,
there are some black and white
works of Devin Dougherty,
including an especially nice
drawing of a nude, with the
unusual perspective of being
slightly lower than the retreating
figure, so that the hips dominate
the focus.
If the exotic per se is often
enough to capture and hold our
interest, fiction dealing with the
mundane has the added problem
of counteracting the dullness of
the world it is attempting to
explore. Written as a monologue,
which can be one of the most
interesting of fictional devices,
"The Fat Lady" by Joanne Jacobs
is the review of a life which has
culminated in a present in which
the most compelling activity is to
suck apart the peanut in an
m & m, or perhaps, to eat around
the chips on a chocolate chip
cookie.
There are some good lines here,
such as the description of her sex
life: "But it changed after we
were married. Joe would be tired
from working overtime and it got
to be like we were just anybody
doing it, not ourselves." Or, the
daughter who has "three children,
a boy and two girls, whose first
words were 'No, thank you.'"

But on the whole one can never
feel very involved with the
character. Joanne Jacobs can
write, but "The Fat Lady" is
ultimately defeated by the dead
weight of her character and her
dull existence.
Reverberating Locksmith
Ron Slate's poem
"Locksmith," also a monologue,
demonstrates the ability of a
metaphor to expand and
reverberate. Listen to the voice of
the locksmith: "What I hoped for
them I was what I once wanted/
for myself: something like a final/
room of certainty." The closing
view is that of the locksmith in his
darkening shop, toying with a
crossword, "stamping my foot/
when baffled like a man/ unable
to enter/ his own home." With its
lock and keys, the poem manages
to suggest more than can be
translated into a literal meaning,
and ends on a haunting note.
Sheridan Crawford's poem
"For My Old Man" is an elegy to
LBJ on his death. "I slipped you
off, this bright empty day,/ You
slipped out without a word, the
only surviving one —/ I dreamed
you straddling a milking stool,
ranch hand,/ 'Mr. Big Man' .. .
Full of odd insistent rhythms and
rhymes, the poem becomes a sort
of berating praise, a begrudged
tribute from a Texas daughter.
The caricature of LBJ by Mark
Rathbun is marvelous.
My favorite of Bob Weston's
four poems is the carefully
phrased "Old Dog." "Though he
lingers at the edge/ Of things, his
old head lifts in faint surprise/
Each time I call, as though I

brought him back/ Upon a scene
grown slowly unfamiliar." Barbara
Glenn expresses artfully the
nature of poetry in "Poem." "A
crystal snare to catch the light,/
The thought that time and talk
obscure —/ This prism breaks to
black on white/ The gray on gray
of what we were."
The Fall. issue of Sequoia
includes four fiction pieces, work
by several artists, and a selection
of thirteen poets. The issue itself
is pleasing in* its composition — a
balanced, interesting combination
of serious work.
A small magazine such as
Sequoia is intrinsically worthwhile
because of its accessibility to the
community, its introduction of
developing talent, its existence as
a purely artistic venture. The Fall
issue of Sequoia has all of these
qualities, plus the final necessary
criterion for success: good writing
enjoyable to read.

Creative Writing Department.)
Donna Lee's "Story" in the
Fall issue of Stanford's literary
magazine, Sequoia, is not your
basic girl meets boy tale; for this
is the story of Ethyl the
Outrageous (real name Brooks),
one of the "saints of the street
queens" and idol of the Midnight
Show at the Threatre of
Nocturnal Dreams, who one night
encounters Alice, the narrator,
while fighting over a satin dress in
a goodwill box. He wins because
he looks better in it.
Ethyl glitters with his sequins,
tinsel, his curly pink wig and silver
lame Aztec Indian outfit. Alice,
on the other hand, is not exactly
the sort to turn up in a tailored
tweed suit: she wears an 1890
swimsuit with bloomers, a pleated
top, a plastic flower swim cap,
with a ducky inner tube gracing
her waist. Also flippers. Thus
begins a beautiful thing.
