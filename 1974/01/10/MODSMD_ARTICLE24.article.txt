# SF Symphony Opens With 'Flourish'
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Maestro Michael Tilson
Thomas and pianist John
Browning joined the San
Francisco Symphony Wednesday
evening, January 2, in Mozart and
Mahler performances that opened
the musical New Year with a

flourish.
A more difficult program
would have been hard to plan and
finer performances, under the
circumstances, even harder to
achieve.
One of the world's youngest
major conductors, Michael Tilson
Thomas made his brilliant debut
with the Boston Symphony in
1969, substituting for ailing
William Steinberg on last-minute
notice. As guest conductor in Seiji
Ozawa's absence, Maestro Thomas
led the orchestra with assurance
and skill despite his limited
experience with the musicians
under him.
Musical Consciousness
Thomas' own musical
consciousness has not yet fully
matured, of course; in ten more
years his few artistic flaws almost
certainly will have been polished
to near-perfection. He is already a
formidable conductor, whose skill
was most evident in the
performance of Gustav Mahler's
immense Ninth Symphony which
concluded the program.
One of the most difficult of
Mahler's consummately difficult
creations, the Ninth requires
enormous concentration and
empathy — as well as the most
developed technical resources —
of both conductor and orchestra
alike. Few ensembles accept so
heady a challenge in the face of
the limited rehearsal time
contemporary musical finances
dictate.
In the face of these obstacles,

Maestro Thomas led the San
Francisco Symphony through the
labyrinth of the opening Andante
commodo with feeling and
occasional flashes of genius.
Confronting Grandeur
Confronting the grandeur of
this music in score is one thing;
bringing it to life in performance
is another matter. A few errors, all
but inevitable in such music, were
easily forgiven.
The following Laendler and
Rondo burleske received even
better performances. Mahler's
sardonic dance movements, filled
with echoes of village band tunes
amid the most sophisticated
and counterpoint,
spark, d with moments of real
technical polish under Maestro
Thomas' leadership.
At last, the concluding Adagio,
Mahler's own farewell to the
world and to life —
unquestionably one of the most
touching of modern symphonic
movements, a celestial vision
epitomizing this master's richest
musical dreaming. Rising to the
occasion, Thomas and company
gave the evening's finest
performance, at once lyric and
profoundly thoughtful, fully
worthy of this masterpiece.
John Browning joined Maestro
Thomas and the orchestra in an
excellent performance of Mozart's
Piano Concerto No. 17 in G
Major, K. 453, which opened the
program. Also relatively young,
and bursting with taste and
technical prowess, Browning

played with conviction and charm
in a style fully suited to Mozart's
demanding work.
Satisfactory Backdrop
Against a fully satisfactory
orchestral backdrop Browning's
playing was at once stern, then
sweet; at once animated, then
wistful. A few mistakes and
ragged entrances marred the
instrumental interludes in the first
movement, but the Andante was
movingly tender, and the
concluding theme-and-variations
brilliance itself. Browning's
cadenzas were especially fine.
