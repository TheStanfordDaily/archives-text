Reagan's Energy Plan Attacked
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's proposal that
Californians cut their personal energy consumption by 10 percent
was attacked as one-sided yesterday by Democratic legislators.
They accused the Republican governor of failing to urge
comparable sacrifices by the oil industry. The governor also was
accused of failing to show leadership to meet the energy crisis.
Reagan asked for the voluntary 10 percent reduction in
gasoline consumption and home energy usage in his televised
eighth and final State of the State address to a joint
Senate-Assembly session.
The energy crisis was the keynote of the address, which was
received coolly by the Democrat-controlled legislature. It was the
first Reagan State of the State message which was not interrupted
even once by applause. As a result, the governor finished the
30-minute address with about two minutes of television time left.
There were even a few vacant seats both in the public gallery
and on the Assembly floor.
Republicans praised Reagan's promise to submit a balanced
budget without new taxes and his plea for a crackdown on
criminals.
Kissinger To Meet With Sadat
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will
fly to Egypt at midnight today to discuss with President Anwar
Sadat proposals by Israel for a military disengagement near the
Suez Canal.
The trip, announced by the Western White House at San
Clemente, Calif., also will take Kissinger to Israel to see Premier
Golda Meir. It will be his third visit to the Middle East since the
October war.
At the Geneva peace conference Egyptian and Israeli military
negotiators are marking time pending new high-level decisions.
Their 90-minute meeting yesterday was the shortest of six
sessions over the past two weeks.
The White House said Kissinger is being sent to Egypt and
Israel by President Nixon "in order to assist the parties in the
negotiations on the question of separation and disengagement" of
their forces.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan outlined Israel's views in
meetings with Kissinger at the State Department last Friday and
Saturday. Dayan said afterward his country is ready "to take the
first step" toward peace with Egypt by reaching an accord on the
separation of their troops. He said his government would be ready
to offer a concrete proposal after the Cabinet received his report.
Kissinger will meet with Sadat at Aswan, the Southern city on
the Nile where the Soviets built a dam for the Egyptians.
He will be gone less than a week.
The Israelis evidently are agreeable to withdrawing at least 20
miles but are seeking "mutual commitments" as Dayan has put it
from Egypt.
These could include an opening of the canal to Israeli
shipment, a thinning out of Egyptian forces on the east bank or a
demilitarization of much of the Sinai.
Kissinger has taken a personal hand in trying to work out a
settlement, leaving only details to the American ambassadors in
Cairo and Jerusalem and to other lesser officials.
Hughes Gave Nixon Blank Checks
WASHINGTON — An agent for billionaire Howard Hughes
gave a number of signed blank checks to the Nixon re-election
campaign a few days before the April 7, 1972 reporting deadline,
a secretary testified in a civil suit deposition made public
yesterday.
Sally Harmony, formerly a secretary to G. Gordon Liddy, said
she could not remember the amounts that were filled in but that
the checks were made out to the Finance Committee for the
Re-election of the President or some subsidiary committees.
An earlier Hughes contribution of $100,000 given to Nixon
intimate Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been the source of much
controversy.

Rebozo said that he later returned the $100,000, made in two
cash payments, to Hughes.
Harmony gave the deposition in a multimillion dollar civil
suit filed by the Democratic National Committee as the result of
the Watergate break-in. The portion of her testimony, given last
April 27, was unsealed yesterday.
The portion of the deposition had been sealed because it did
not relate to post-Watergate developments covered by the civil
suit. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained information about
what the deposition contained and asked the judge in the case to
release it.
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey said he unsealed the
deposition after obtaining agreement from all attorneys in the
case and from the office of the special Watergate prosecutor.
"I know one time a contributor brought some signed blank
checks to Mr. Liddy and I fillet! them out," Harmony said in
the deposition. "That is what I did with a few checks like that. I
put the amounts in."
At the time of the Watergate break-in, June 17, 1972 Liddy
was general counsel for the finance committee. He later was one
of seven men convicted of burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping
in the Democratic headquarters break-in and was sentenced to a
minimum six years, eight months in prison.
Nixon Axes Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration has decided
against including welfare reform in the fiscal 1975 federal budget.
But it plans to send Congress a proposal this year featuring
incentives for the poor to work.
The proposal, still being worked on by administration
planners, may tie welfare to the tax system in some modified
form of the so-called negative income tax, in effect, a guaranteed
annual income for those making below a certain level.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said the administration has "got to deal with this issue that has
been so divisive in the past — the relationship between work and
welfare."
He praised, without backing, a proposal by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to
provide a work bonus for the working poor. Long's plan, which
died in the last session of Congress, would have benefited about
five million families at a cost of $1 billion a year.
Ash said in a recent interview that the administration proposal
will provide a relationship to taxes and to work for welfare
recipients.
"We can't say, taxes you go one way, welfare you go another,"
he said. "The issue is not whether they are related, but how they
are related."
The negative income tax idea is based on the concept that
there is a certain income level at which a family should neither
receive welfare nor pay taxes. Under the concept, if the family
earns less than the subsistence level, it would be paid enough
welfare to reach the subsistence level.
Ash would give no details on how the administration proposal
is likely to come out, but he said the administration should try to
find new language for welfare reform, instead of such phrases as
negative income tax and family assistance.
Court Strikes Loyalty Oath
WASHINGTON — States may not bar political parties from
the ballot for refusing to renounce violent overthrow of the
government the Supreme Court held yesterday.
The court unanimously struck down an Indiana oath requiring
the foreswearing of violence. It had been challenged by the
Indiana Communist party.
Five of the justices, led by William J. Brennan Jr., found the
Indiana statute violated guarantees of the First and 14th
amendments.
The law makes no provision, Brennan said, between the
abstract doctrine of violent overthrow and advocacy of action to
topple the government.

.. The mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or
even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the
same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to
such action," Brennan quoted from an earlier high court decision.
"The statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly
intrudes on the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which
our Constitution has immunized from governmental control,"
Brennan said.
When it comes to deciding whether or not a political party
deserves a place on the ballot, he continued, a group advocating
the abstract doctrine of violent overthrow need not be regarded
as necessarily advocating unlawful action.
British Industries On Verge Of Collapse
LONDON — Pay disputes involving Britain's coal miners and
train engineers neared deadlock yesterday confronting the nation
with the possibility of almost total industrial collapse.
Prime Minister Edward Heath spurned proposals by opposition
Labor party chief Harold Wilson for a compromise with the
nation's 280,000 coal miners, whose ban on overtime has cut
output by nearly 40 percent.
Parliament was recalled to debate the emergency. In the House
of Commons lights were dimmed and heating was turned down to
save fuel.
One elderly Conservative legislator, Irene Ward, wrapped up in
a fur coat to keep warm.
k US Planned Second Bay Of Pigs'
NEW YORK — Freelance journalist Tad Szulc says the United
States during President Lyndon Johnson's administration planned
a second invasion of Cuba combined with an effort to assassinate
Premier Fidel Castro.
The plan had to be canceled, Szulc said in an article to be
published in the Jan. 17 Esquire magazine, when rebellion
unexpectedly erupted in the Dominican Republican in April,
1965, and Johnson sent troops to that country.
Szulc, a former diplomatic correspondent for the New York
Times, said the operation was planned by the Central Intelligence
Agency, "presumably acting with President Lyndon Johnson's
authority unless it was another do-it-yourself undertaking."
Nixon Calls Oil Meeting
WASHINGTON — The foreign ministers of six major
oil-consuming western European nations and Japan and Canada
have been invited to attend a meeting here next month on global
energy problems, the White House announced yesterday.
The purpose of the conference, according to the
announcement made in San Clemente, Calif., is "to discuss an
action program on international energy problems."
The announcement said President Nixon sent personal
messages to the heads of government of France, Germany,
Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway, as well as Japan and
Canada, inviting the foreign ministers to the Feb. 11 session.
Personal messages were also sent by the President, according to
the announcement, to the heads of the nations of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, informing them
of the Feb. 11 meeting and suggesting a later conference of
oil-consuming and oil-producing nations.
Plans for a similar meeting have been discussed by the
exporting organization in sessions in Geneva this week.
Today's Weather
Fair through tonight. Increasing cloudiness tomorrow.
Warming trend beginning tonight. Low tonight in the mid 30s to
mid 40s. High today in the 50s and tomorrow in the upper 50s
and low 60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to 25 mph
tomorrow.

The Israelis evidently are agreeable to withdrawing at least 20
miles but are seeking "mutual commitments" as Dayan has put it
from Egypt.
These could include an opening of the canal to Israeli
shipment, a thinning out of Egyptian forces on the east bank or a
demilitarization of much of the Sinai.
Kissinger has taken a personal hand in trying to work out a
settlement, leaving only details to the American ambassadors in
Cairo and Jerusalem and to other lesser officials.
Hughes Gave Nixon Blank Checks
WASHINGTON — An agent for billionaire Howard Hughes
gave a number of signed blank checks to the Nixon re-election
campaign a few days before the April 7, 1972 reporting deadline,
a secretary testified in a civil suit deposition made public
yesterday.
Sally Harmony, formerly a secretary to G. Gordon Liddy, said
she could not remember the amounts that were filled in but that
the checks were made out to the Finance Committee for the
Re-election of the President or some subsidiary committees.
An earlier Hughes contribution of $100,000 given to Nixon
intimate Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been the source of much
controversy.

Rebozo said that he later returned the $100,000, made in two
cash payments, to Hughes.
Harmony gave the deposition in a multimillion dollar civil
suit filed by the Democratic National Committee as the result of
the Watergate break-in. The portion of her testimony, given last
April 27, was unsealed yesterday.
The portion of the deposition had been sealed because it did
not relate to post-Watergate developments covered by the civil
suit. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained information about
what the deposition contained and asked the judge in the case to
release it.
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey said he unsealed the
deposition after obtaining agreement from all attorneys in the
case and from the office of the special Watergate prosecutor.
"I know one time a contributor brought some signed blank
checks to Mr. Liddy and I fillet! them out," Harmony said in
the deposition. "That is what I did with a few checks like that. I
put the amounts in."
At the time of the Watergate break-in, June 17, 1972 Liddy
was general counsel for the finance committee. He later was one
of seven men convicted of burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping
in the Democratic headquarters break-in and was sentenced to a
minimum six years, eight months in prison.
Nixon Axes Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration has decided
against including welfare reform in the fiscal 1975 federal budget.
But it plans to send Congress a proposal this year featuring
incentives for the poor to work.
The proposal, still being worked on by administration
planners, may tie welfare to the tax system in some modified
form of the so-called negative income tax, in effect, a guaranteed
annual income for those making below a certain level.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said the administration has "got to deal with this issue that has
been so divisive in the past — the relationship between work and
welfare."
He praised, without backing, a proposal by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to
provide a work bonus for the working poor. Long's plan, which
died in the last session of Congress, would have benefited about
five million families at a cost of $1 billion a year.
Ash said in a recent interview that the administration proposal
will provide a relationship to taxes and to work for welfare
recipients.
"We can't say, taxes you go one way, welfare you go another,"
he said. "The issue is not whether they are related, but how they
are related."
The negative income tax idea is based on the concept that
there is a certain income level at which a family should neither
receive welfare nor pay taxes. Under the concept, if the family
earns less than the subsistence level, it would be paid enough
welfare to reach the subsistence level.
Ash would give no details on how the administration proposal
is likely to come out, but he said the administration should try to
find new language for welfare reform, instead of such phrases as
negative income tax and family assistance.
Court Strikes Loyalty Oath
WASHINGTON — States may not bar political parties from
the ballot for refusing to renounce violent overthrow of the
government the Supreme Court held yesterday.
The court unanimously struck down an Indiana oath requiring
the foreswearing of violence. It had been challenged by the
Indiana Communist party.
Five of the justices, led by William J. Brennan Jr., found the
Indiana statute violated guarantees of the First and 14th
amendments.
The law makes no provision, Brennan said, between the
abstract doctrine of violent overthrow and advocacy of action to
topple the government.

.. The mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or
even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the
same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to
such action," Brennan quoted from an earlier high court decision.
"The statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly
intrudes on the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which
our Constitution has immunized from governmental control,"
Brennan said.
When it comes to deciding whether or not a political party
deserves a place on the ballot, he continued, a group advocating
the abstract doctrine of violent overthrow need not be regarded
as necessarily advocating unlawful action.
British Industries On Verge Of Collapse
LONDON — Pay disputes involving Britain's coal miners and
train engineers neared deadlock yesterday confronting the nation
with the possibility of almost total industrial collapse.
Prime Minister Edward Heath spurned proposals by opposition
Labor party chief Harold Wilson for a compromise with the
nation's 280,000 coal miners, whose ban on overtime has cut
output by nearly 40 percent.
Parliament was recalled to debate the emergency. In the House
of Commons lights were dimmed and heating was turned down to
save fuel.
One elderly Conservative legislator, Irene Ward, wrapped up in
a fur coat to keep warm.
k US Planned Second Bay Of Pigs'
NEW YORK — Freelance journalist Tad Szulc says the United
States during President Lyndon Johnson's administration planned
a second invasion of Cuba combined with an effort to assassinate
Premier Fidel Castro.
The plan had to be canceled, Szulc said in an article to be
published in the Jan. 17 Esquire magazine, when rebellion
unexpectedly erupted in the Dominican Republican in April,
1965, and Johnson sent troops to that country.
Szulc, a former diplomatic correspondent for the New York
Times, said the operation was planned by the Central Intelligence
Agency, "presumably acting with President Lyndon Johnson's
authority unless it was another do-it-yourself undertaking."
Nixon Calls Oil Meeting
WASHINGTON — The foreign ministers of six major
oil-consuming western European nations and Japan and Canada
have been invited to attend a meeting here next month on global
energy problems, the White House announced yesterday.
The purpose of the conference, according to the
announcement made in San Clemente, Calif., is "to discuss an
action program on international energy problems."
The announcement said President Nixon sent personal
messages to the heads of government of France, Germany,
Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway, as well as Japan and
Canada, inviting the foreign ministers to the Feb. 11 session.
Personal messages were also sent by the President, according to
the announcement, to the heads of the nations of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, informing them
of the Feb. 11 meeting and suggesting a later conference of
oil-consuming and oil-producing nations.
Plans for a similar meeting have been discussed by the
exporting organization in sessions in Geneva this week.
Today's Weather
Fair through tonight. Increasing cloudiness tomorrow.
Warming trend beginning tonight. Low tonight in the mid 30s to
mid 40s. High today in the 50s and tomorrow in the upper 50s
and low 60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to 25 mph
tomorrow.
Reagan's Energy Plan Attacked
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's proposal that
Californians cut their personal energy consumption by 10 percent
was attacked as one-sided yesterday by Democratic legislators.
They accused the Republican governor of failing to urge
comparable sacrifices by the oil industry. The governor also was
accused of failing to show leadership to meet the energy crisis.
Reagan asked for the voluntary 10 percent reduction in
gasoline consumption and home energy usage in his televised
eighth and final State of the State address to a joint
Senate-Assembly session.
The energy crisis was the keynote of the address, which was
received coolly by the Democrat-controlled legislature. It was the
first Reagan State of the State message which was not interrupted
even once by applause. As a result, the governor finished the
30-minute address with about two minutes of television time left.
There were even a few vacant seats both in the public gallery
and on the Assembly floor.
Republicans praised Reagan's promise to submit a balanced
budget without new taxes and his plea for a crackdown on
criminals.
Kissinger To Meet With Sadat
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will
fly to Egypt at midnight today to discuss with President Anwar
Sadat proposals by Israel for a military disengagement near the
Suez Canal.
The trip, announced by the Western White House at San
Clemente, Calif., also will take Kissinger to Israel to see Premier
Golda Meir. It will be his third visit to the Middle East since the
October war.
At the Geneva peace conference Egyptian and Israeli military
negotiators are marking time pending new high-level decisions.
Their 90-minute meeting yesterday was the shortest of six
sessions over the past two weeks.
The White House said Kissinger is being sent to Egypt and
Israel by President Nixon "in order to assist the parties in the
negotiations on the question of separation and disengagement" of
their forces.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan outlined Israel's views in
meetings with Kissinger at the State Department last Friday and
Saturday. Dayan said afterward his country is ready "to take the
first step" toward peace with Egypt by reaching an accord on the
separation of their troops. He said his government would be ready
to offer a concrete proposal after the Cabinet received his report.
Kissinger will meet with Sadat at Aswan, the Southern city on
the Nile where the Soviets built a dam for the Egyptians.
He will be gone less than a week.
The Israelis evidently are agreeable to withdrawing at least 20
miles but are seeking "mutual commitments" as Dayan has put it
from Egypt.

Nixon Axes Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration has decided
against including welfare reform in the fiscal 1975 federal budget.
But it plans to send Congress a proposal this year featuring
incentives for the poor to work.
The proposal, still being worked on by administration
planners, may tie welfare to the tax system in some modified
form of the so-called negative income tax, in effect, a guaranteed
annual income for those making below a certain level.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said the administration has "got to deal with this issue that has
been so divisive in the past — the relationship between work and
welfare."
He praised, without backing, a proposal by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to
provide a work bonus for the working poor. Long's plan, which
died in the last session of Congress, would have benefited about
five million families at a cost of $1 billion a year.
Ash said in a recent interview that the administration proposal
will provide a relationship to taxes and to work for welfare
recipients.
"We can't say, taxes you go one way, welfare you go another,"
he said. "The issue is not whether they are related, but how they
are related."
The negative income tax idea is based on the concept that
there is a certain income level at which a family should neither
receive welfare nor pay taxes. Under the concept, if the family
earns less than the subsistence level, it would be paid enough
welfare to reach the subsistence level.
Ash would give no details on how the administration proposal
is likely to come out, but he said the administration should try to
find new language for welfare reform, instead of such phrases as
negative income tax and family assistance.
Court Strikes Loyalty Oath
WASHINGTON — States may not bar political parties from
the ballot for refusing to renounce violent overthrow of the
government the Supreme Court held yesterday.
The court unanimously struck down an Indiana oath requiring
the foreswearing of violence. It had been challenged by the
Indiana Communist party.
Five of the justices, led by William J. Brennan Jr., found the
Indiana statute violated guarantees of the First and 14th
amendments.
The law makes no provision, Brennan said, between the
abstract doctrine of violent overthrow and advocacy of action to
topple the government.

.. The mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or
even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the
same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to
such action," Brennan quoted from an earlier high court decision.
"The statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly
intrudes on the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which
our Constitution has immunized from governmental control,"
Brennan said.
When it comes to deciding whether or not a political party
deserves a place on the ballot, he continued, a group advocating
the abstract doctrine of violent overthrow need not be regarded
as necessarily advocating unlawful action.
British Industries On Verge Of Collapse
LONDON — Pay disputes involving Britain's coal miners and
train engineers neared deadlock yesterday confronting the nation
with the possibility of almost total industrial collapse.
Prime Minister Edward Heath spurned proposals by opposition
Labor party chief Harold Wilson for a compromise with the
nation's 280,000 coal miners, whose ban on overtime has cut
output by nearly 40 percent.
Parliament was recalled to debate the emergency. In the House
of Commons lights were dimmed and heating was turned down to
save fuel.
One elderly Conservative legislator, Irene Ward, wrapped up in
a fur coat to keep warm.
k US Planned Second Bay Of Pigs'
NEW YORK — Freelance journalist Tad Szulc says the United
States during President Lyndon Johnson's administration planned
a second invasion of Cuba combined with an effort to assassinate
Premier Fidel Castro.
The plan had to be canceled, Szulc said in an article to be
published in the Jan. 17 Esquire magazine, when rebellion
unexpectedly erupted in the Dominican Republican in April,
1965, and Johnson sent troops to that country.
Szulc, a former diplomatic correspondent for the New York
Times, said the operation was planned by the Central Intelligence
Agency, "presumably acting with President Lyndon Johnson's
authority unless it was another do-it-yourself undertaking."
Nixon Calls Oil Meeting
WASHINGTON — The foreign ministers of six major
oil-consuming western European nations and Japan and Canada
have been invited to attend a meeting here next month on global
energy problems, the White House announced yesterday.
The purpose of the conference, according to the
announcement made in San Clemente, Calif., is "to discuss an
action program on international energy problems."
The announcement said President Nixon sent personal
messages to the heads of government of France, Germany,
Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway, as well as Japan and
Canada, inviting the foreign ministers to the Feb. 11 session.
Personal messages were also sent by the President, according to
the announcement, to the heads of the nations of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, informing them
of the Feb. 11 meeting and suggesting a later conference of
oil-consuming and oil-producing nations.
Plans for a similar meeting have been discussed by the
exporting organization in sessions in Geneva this week.
Today's Weather
Fair through tonight. Increasing cloudiness tomorrow.
Warming trend beginning tonight. Low tonight in the mid 30s to
mid 40s. High today in the 50s and tomorrow in the upper 50s
and low 60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to 25 mph
tomorrow.
Reagan's Energy Plan Attacked
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's proposal that
Californians cut their personal energy consumption by 10 percent
was attacked as one-sided yesterday by Democratic legislators.
They accused the Republican governor of failing to urge
comparable sacrifices by the oil industry. The governor also was
accused of failing to show leadership to meet the energy crisis.
Reagan asked for the voluntary 10 percent reduction in
gasoline consumption and home energy usage in his televised
eighth and final State of the State address to a joint
Senate-Assembly session.
The energy crisis was the keynote of the address, which was
received coolly by the Democrat-controlled legislature. It was the
first Reagan State of the State message which was not interrupted
even once by applause. As a result, the governor finished the
30-minute address with about two minutes of television time left.
There were even a few vacant seats both in the public gallery
and on the Assembly floor.
Republicans praised Reagan's promise to submit a balanced
budget without new taxes and his plea for a crackdown on
criminals.
Kissinger To Meet With Sadat
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will
fly to Egypt at midnight today to discuss with President Anwar
Sadat proposals by Israel for a military disengagement near the
Suez Canal.
The trip, announced by the Western White House at San
Clemente, Calif., also will take Kissinger to Israel to see Premier
Golda Meir. It will be his third visit to the Middle East since the
October war.
At the Geneva peace conference Egyptian and Israeli military
negotiators are marking time pending new high-level decisions.
Their 90-minute meeting yesterday was the shortest of six
sessions over the past two weeks.
The White House said Kissinger is being sent to Egypt and
Israel by President Nixon "in order to assist the parties in the
negotiations on the question of separation and disengagement" of
their forces.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan outlined Israel's views in
meetings with Kissinger at the State Department last Friday and
Saturday. Dayan said afterward his country is ready "to take the
first step" toward peace with Egypt by reaching an accord on the
separation of their troops. He said his government would be ready
to offer a concrete proposal after the Cabinet received his report.
Kissinger will meet with Sadat at Aswan, the Southern city on
the Nile where the Soviets built a dam for the Egyptians.
He will be gone less than a week.
The Israelis evidently are agreeable to withdrawing at least 20
miles but are seeking "mutual commitments" as Dayan has put it
from Egypt.
These could include an opening of the canal to Israeli
shipment, a thinning out of Egyptian forces on the east bank or a
demilitarization of much of the Sinai.
Kissinger has taken a personal hand in trying to work out a
settlement, leaving only details to the American ambassadors in
Cairo and Jerusalem and to other lesser officials.
Hughes Gave Nixon Blank Checks
WASHINGTON — An agent for billionaire Howard Hughes
gave a number of signed blank checks to the Nixon re-election
campaign a few days before the April 7, 1972 reporting deadline,
a secretary testified in a civil suit deposition made public
yesterday.
Sally Harmony, formerly a secretary to G. Gordon Liddy, said
she could not remember the amounts that were filled in but that
the checks were made out to the Finance Committee for the
Re-election of the President or some subsidiary committees.
An earlier Hughes contribution of $100,000 given to Nixon
intimate Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been the source of much
controversy.

Rebozo said that he later returned the $100,000, made in two
cash payments, to Hughes.
Harmony gave the deposition in a multimillion dollar civil
suit filed by the Democratic National Committee as the result of
the Watergate break-in. The portion of her testimony, given last
April 27, was unsealed yesterday.
The portion of the deposition had been sealed because it did
not relate to post-Watergate developments covered by the civil
suit. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained information about
what the deposition contained and asked the judge in the case to
release it.
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey said he unsealed the
deposition after obtaining agreement from all attorneys in the
case and from the office of the special Watergate prosecutor.
"I know one time a contributor brought some signed blank
checks to Mr. Liddy and I fillet! them out," Harmony said in
the deposition. "That is what I did with a few checks like that. I
put the amounts in."
At the time of the Watergate break-in, June 17, 1972 Liddy
was general counsel for the finance committee. He later was one
of seven men convicted of burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping
in the Democratic headquarters break-in and was sentenced to a
minimum six years, eight months in prison.

abstract doctrine of violent overthrow and advocacy of action to
topple the government.

.. The mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or
even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the
same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to
such action," Brennan quoted from an earlier high court decision.
"The statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly
intrudes on the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which
our Constitution has immunized from governmental control,"
Brennan said.
When it comes to deciding whether or not a political party
deserves a place on the ballot, he continued, a group advocating
the abstract doctrine of violent overthrow need not be regarded
as necessarily advocating unlawful action.
British Industries On Verge Of Collapse
LONDON — Pay disputes involving Britain's coal miners and
train engineers neared deadlock yesterday confronting the nation
with the possibility of almost total industrial collapse.
Prime Minister Edward Heath spurned proposals by opposition
Labor party chief Harold Wilson for a compromise with the
nation's 280,000 coal miners, whose ban on overtime has cut
output by nearly 40 percent.
Parliament was recalled to debate the emergency. In the House
of Commons lights were dimmed and heating was turned down to
save fuel.
One elderly Conservative legislator, Irene Ward, wrapped up in
a fur coat to keep warm.
k US Planned Second Bay Of Pigs'
NEW YORK — Freelance journalist Tad Szulc says the United
States during President Lyndon Johnson's administration planned
a second invasion of Cuba combined with an effort to assassinate
Premier Fidel Castro.
The plan had to be canceled, Szulc said in an article to be
published in the Jan. 17 Esquire magazine, when rebellion
unexpectedly erupted in the Dominican Republican in April,
1965, and Johnson sent troops to that country.
Szulc, a former diplomatic correspondent for the New York
Times, said the operation was planned by the Central Intelligence
Agency, "presumably acting with President Lyndon Johnson's
authority unless it was another do-it-yourself undertaking."
Nixon Calls Oil Meeting
WASHINGTON — The foreign ministers of six major
oil-consuming western European nations and Japan and Canada
have been invited to attend a meeting here next month on global
energy problems, the White House announced yesterday.
The purpose of the conference, according to the
announcement made in San Clemente, Calif., is "to discuss an
action program on international energy problems."
The announcement said President Nixon sent personal
messages to the heads of government of France, Germany,
Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway, as well as Japan and
Canada, inviting the foreign ministers to the Feb. 11 session.
Personal messages were also sent by the President, according to
the announcement, to the heads of the nations of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, informing them
of the Feb. 11 meeting and suggesting a later conference of
oil-consuming and oil-producing nations.
Plans for a similar meeting have been discussed by the
exporting organization in sessions in Geneva this week.
Today's Weather
Fair through tonight. Increasing cloudiness tomorrow.
Warming trend beginning tonight. Low tonight in the mid 30s to
mid 40s. High today in the 50s and tomorrow in the upper 50s
and low 60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to 25 mph
tomorrow.
Reagan's Energy Plan Attacked
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's proposal that
Californians cut their personal energy consumption by 10 percent
was attacked as one-sided yesterday by Democratic legislators.
They accused the Republican governor of failing to urge
comparable sacrifices by the oil industry. The governor also was
accused of failing to show leadership to meet the energy crisis.
Reagan asked for the voluntary 10 percent reduction in
gasoline consumption and home energy usage in his televised
eighth and final State of the State address to a joint
Senate-Assembly session.
The energy crisis was the keynote of the address, which was
received coolly by the Democrat-controlled legislature. It was the
first Reagan State of the State message which was not interrupted
even once by applause. As a result, the governor finished the
30-minute address with about two minutes of television time left.
There were even a few vacant seats both in the public gallery
and on the Assembly floor.
Republicans praised Reagan's promise to submit a balanced
budget without new taxes and his plea for a crackdown on
criminals.
Kissinger To Meet With Sadat
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will
fly to Egypt at midnight today to discuss with President Anwar
Sadat proposals by Israel for a military disengagement near the
Suez Canal.
The trip, announced by the Western White House at San
Clemente, Calif., also will take Kissinger to Israel to see Premier
Golda Meir. It will be his third visit to the Middle East since the
October war.
At the Geneva peace conference Egyptian and Israeli military
negotiators are marking time pending new high-level decisions.
Their 90-minute meeting yesterday was the shortest of six
sessions over the past two weeks.
The White House said Kissinger is being sent to Egypt and
Israel by President Nixon "in order to assist the parties in the
negotiations on the question of separation and disengagement" of
their forces.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan outlined Israel's views in
meetings with Kissinger at the State Department last Friday and
Saturday. Dayan said afterward his country is ready "to take the
first step" toward peace with Egypt by reaching an accord on the
separation of their troops. He said his government would be ready
to offer a concrete proposal after the Cabinet received his report.
Kissinger will meet with Sadat at Aswan, the Southern city on
the Nile where the Soviets built a dam for the Egyptians.
He will be gone less than a week.
The Israelis evidently are agreeable to withdrawing at least 20
miles but are seeking "mutual commitments" as Dayan has put it
from Egypt.
These could include an opening of the canal to Israeli
shipment, a thinning out of Egyptian forces on the east bank or a
demilitarization of much of the Sinai.
Kissinger has taken a personal hand in trying to work out a
settlement, leaving only details to the American ambassadors in
Cairo and Jerusalem and to other lesser officials.
Hughes Gave Nixon Blank Checks
WASHINGTON — An agent for billionaire Howard Hughes
gave a number of signed blank checks to the Nixon re-election
campaign a few days before the April 7, 1972 reporting deadline,
a secretary testified in a civil suit deposition made public
yesterday.
Sally Harmony, formerly a secretary to G. Gordon Liddy, said
she could not remember the amounts that were filled in but that
the checks were made out to the Finance Committee for the
Re-election of the President or some subsidiary committees.
An earlier Hughes contribution of $100,000 given to Nixon
intimate Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been the source of much
controversy.

Rebozo said that he later returned the $100,000, made in two
cash payments, to Hughes.
Harmony gave the deposition in a multimillion dollar civil
suit filed by the Democratic National Committee as the result of
the Watergate break-in. The portion of her testimony, given last
April 27, was unsealed yesterday.
The portion of the deposition had been sealed because it did
not relate to post-Watergate developments covered by the civil
suit. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained information about
what the deposition contained and asked the judge in the case to
release it.
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey said he unsealed the
deposition after obtaining agreement from all attorneys in the
case and from the office of the special Watergate prosecutor.
"I know one time a contributor brought some signed blank
checks to Mr. Liddy and I fillet! them out," Harmony said in
the deposition. "That is what I did with a few checks like that. I
put the amounts in."
At the time of the Watergate break-in, June 17, 1972 Liddy
was general counsel for the finance committee. He later was one
of seven men convicted of burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping
in the Democratic headquarters break-in and was sentenced to a
minimum six years, eight months in prison.
Nixon Axes Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration has decided
against including welfare reform in the fiscal 1975 federal budget.
But it plans to send Congress a proposal this year featuring
incentives for the poor to work.
The proposal, still being worked on by administration
planners, may tie welfare to the tax system in some modified
form of the so-called negative income tax, in effect, a guaranteed
annual income for those making below a certain level.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said the administration has "got to deal with this issue that has
been so divisive in the past — the relationship between work and
welfare."
He praised, without backing, a proposal by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to
provide a work bonus for the working poor. Long's plan, which
died in the last session of Congress, would have benefited about
five million families at a cost of $1 billion a year.
Ash said in a recent interview that the administration proposal
will provide a relationship to taxes and to work for welfare
recipients.
"We can't say, taxes you go one way, welfare you go another,"
he said. "The issue is not whether they are related, but how they
are related."
The negative income tax idea is based on the concept that
there is a certain income level at which a family should neither
receive welfare nor pay taxes. Under the concept, if the family
earns less than the subsistence level, it would be paid enough
welfare to reach the subsistence level.
Ash would give no details on how the administration proposal
is likely to come out, but he said the administration should try to
find new language for welfare reform, instead of such phrases as
negative income tax and family assistance.
Court Strikes Loyalty Oath
WASHINGTON — States may not bar political parties from
the ballot for refusing to renounce violent overthrow of the
government the Supreme Court held yesterday.
The court unanimously struck down an Indiana oath requiring
the foreswearing of violence. It had been challenged by the
Indiana Communist party.
Five of the justices, led by William J. Brennan Jr., found the
Indiana statute violated guarantees of the First and 14th
amendments.
The law makes no provision, Brennan said, between the
abstract doctrine of violent overthrow and advocacy of action to
topple the government.

.. The mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or
even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the

action program on international energy problems."
The announcement said President Nixon sent personal
messages to the heads of government of France, Germany,
Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway, as well as Japan and
Canada, inviting the foreign ministers to the Feb. 11 session.
Personal messages were also sent by the President, according to
the announcement, to the heads of the nations of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, informing them
of the Feb. 11 meeting and suggesting a later conference of
oil-consuming and oil-producing nations.
Plans for a similar meeting have been discussed by the
exporting organization in sessions in Geneva this week.

Reagan's Energy Plan Attacked
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan's proposal that
Californians cut their personal energy consumption by 10 percent
was attacked as one-sided yesterday by Democratic legislators.
They accused the Republican governor of failing to urge
comparable sacrifices by the oil industry. The governor also was
accused of failing to show leadership to meet the energy crisis.
Reagan asked for the voluntary 10 percent reduction in
gasoline consumption and home energy usage in his televised
eighth and final State of the State address to a joint
Senate-Assembly session.
The energy crisis was the keynote of the address, which was
received coolly by the Democrat-controlled legislature. It was the
first Reagan State of the State message which was not interrupted
even once by applause. As a result, the governor finished the
30-minute address with about two minutes of television time left.
There were even a few vacant seats both in the public gallery
and on the Assembly floor.
Republicans praised Reagan's promise to submit a balanced
budget without new taxes and his plea for a crackdown on
criminals.
Kissinger To Meet With Sadat
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will
fly to Egypt at midnight today to discuss with President Anwar
Sadat proposals by Israel for a military disengagement near the
Suez Canal.
The trip, announced by the Western White House at San
Clemente, Calif., also will take Kissinger to Israel to see Premier
Golda Meir. It will be his third visit to the Middle East since the
October war.
At the Geneva peace conference Egyptian and Israeli military
negotiators are marking time pending new high-level decisions.
Their 90-minute meeting yesterday was the shortest of six
sessions over the past two weeks.
The White House said Kissinger is being sent to Egypt and
Israel by President Nixon "in order to assist the parties in the
negotiations on the question of separation and disengagement" of
their forces.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan outlined Israel's views in
meetings with Kissinger at the State Department last Friday and
Saturday. Dayan said afterward his country is ready "to take the
first step" toward peace with Egypt by reaching an accord on the
separation of their troops. He said his government would be ready
to offer a concrete proposal after the Cabinet received his report.
Kissinger will meet with Sadat at Aswan, the Southern city on
the Nile where the Soviets built a dam for the Egyptians.
He will be gone less than a week.
The Israelis evidently are agreeable to withdrawing at least 20
miles but are seeking "mutual commitments" as Dayan has put it
from Egypt.
These could include an opening of the canal to Israeli
shipment, a thinning out of Egyptian forces on the east bank or a
demilitarization of much of the Sinai.
Kissinger has taken a personal hand in trying to work out a
settlement, leaving only details to the American ambassadors in
Cairo and Jerusalem and to other lesser officials.
Hughes Gave Nixon Blank Checks
WASHINGTON — An agent for billionaire Howard Hughes
gave a number of signed blank checks to the Nixon re-election
campaign a few days before the April 7, 1972 reporting deadline,
a secretary testified in a civil suit deposition made public
yesterday.
Sally Harmony, formerly a secretary to G. Gordon Liddy, said
she could not remember the amounts that were filled in but that
the checks were made out to the Finance Committee for the
Re-election of the President or some subsidiary committees.
An earlier Hughes contribution of $100,000 given to Nixon
intimate Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been the source of much
controversy.

Rebozo said that he later returned the $100,000, made in two
cash payments, to Hughes.
Harmony gave the deposition in a multimillion dollar civil
suit filed by the Democratic National Committee as the result of
the Watergate break-in. The portion of her testimony, given last
April 27, was unsealed yesterday.
The portion of the deposition had been sealed because it did
not relate to post-Watergate developments covered by the civil
suit. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained information about
what the deposition contained and asked the judge in the case to
release it.
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey said he unsealed the
deposition after obtaining agreement from all attorneys in the
case and from the office of the special Watergate prosecutor.
"I know one time a contributor brought some signed blank
checks to Mr. Liddy and I fillet! them out," Harmony said in
the deposition. "That is what I did with a few checks like that. I
put the amounts in."
At the time of the Watergate break-in, June 17, 1972 Liddy
was general counsel for the finance committee. He later was one
of seven men convicted of burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping
in the Democratic headquarters break-in and was sentenced to a
minimum six years, eight months in prison.
Nixon Axes Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration has decided
against including welfare reform in the fiscal 1975 federal budget.
But it plans to send Congress a proposal this year featuring
incentives for the poor to work.
The proposal, still being worked on by administration
planners, may tie welfare to the tax system in some modified
form of the so-called negative income tax, in effect, a guaranteed
annual income for those making below a certain level.
Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said the administration has "got to deal with this issue that has
been so divisive in the past — the relationship between work and
welfare."
He praised, without backing, a proposal by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to
provide a work bonus for the working poor. Long's plan, which
died in the last session of Congress, would have benefited about
five million families at a cost of $1 billion a year.
Ash said in a recent interview that the administration proposal
will provide a relationship to taxes and to work for welfare
recipients.
"We can't say, taxes you go one way, welfare you go another,"
he said. "The issue is not whether they are related, but how they
are related."
The negative income tax idea is based on the concept that
there is a certain income level at which a family should neither
receive welfare nor pay taxes. Under the concept, if the family
earns less than the subsistence level, it would be paid enough
welfare to reach the subsistence level.
Ash would give no details on how the administration proposal
is likely to come out, but he said the administration should try to
find new language for welfare reform, instead of such phrases as
negative income tax and family assistance.
Court Strikes Loyalty Oath
WASHINGTON — States may not bar political parties from
the ballot for refusing to renounce violent overthrow of the
government the Supreme Court held yesterday.
The court unanimously struck down an Indiana oath requiring
the foreswearing of violence. It had been challenged by the
Indiana Communist party.
Five of the justices, led by William J. Brennan Jr., found the
Indiana statute violated guarantees of the First and 14th
amendments.
The law makes no provision, Brennan said, between the
abstract doctrine of violent overthrow and advocacy of action to
topple the government.

.. The mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or
even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the
same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to
such action," Brennan quoted from an earlier high court decision.
"The statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly
intrudes on the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which
our Constitution has immunized from governmental control,"
Brennan said.
When it comes to deciding whether or not a political party
deserves a place on the ballot, he continued, a group advocating
the abstract doctrine of violent overthrow need not be regarded
as necessarily advocating unlawful action.
British Industries On Verge Of Collapse
LONDON — Pay disputes involving Britain's coal miners and
train engineers neared deadlock yesterday confronting the nation
with the possibility of almost total industrial collapse.
Prime Minister Edward Heath spurned proposals by opposition
Labor party chief Harold Wilson for a compromise with the
nation's 280,000 coal miners, whose ban on overtime has cut
output by nearly 40 percent.
Parliament was recalled to debate the emergency. In the House
of Commons lights were dimmed and heating was turned down to
save fuel.
One elderly Conservative legislator, Irene Ward, wrapped up in
a fur coat to keep warm.
k US Planned Second Bay Of Pigs'
NEW YORK — Freelance journalist Tad Szulc says the United
States during President Lyndon Johnson's administration planned
a second invasion of Cuba combined with an effort to assassinate
Premier Fidel Castro.
The plan had to be canceled, Szulc said in an article to be
published in the Jan. 17 Esquire magazine, when rebellion
unexpectedly erupted in the Dominican Republican in April,
1965, and Johnson sent troops to that country.
Szulc, a former diplomatic correspondent for the New York
Times, said the operation was planned by the Central Intelligence
Agency, "presumably acting with President Lyndon Johnson's
authority unless it was another do-it-yourself undertaking."
Nixon Calls Oil Meeting
WASHINGTON — The foreign ministers of six major
oil-consuming western European nations and Japan and Canada
have been invited to attend a meeting here next month on global
energy problems, the White House announced yesterday.
The purpose of the conference, according to the
announcement made in San Clemente, Calif., is "to discuss an
action program on international energy problems."
