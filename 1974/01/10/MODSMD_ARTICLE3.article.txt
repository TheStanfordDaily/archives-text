# Aides Under Milk, ITT Clouds
## Nixon Fails To Dispel Doubt 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon's latest statements on the milk
fund and ITT affairs defend his own
position, but leave questions about
some of his former aides.
The White House again denied that
promises of political contributions
were behind Nixon's decision to raise
dairy price supports, or administration
settlement of an antitrust case against
International Telephone and Telegraph
Corp.
In the milk-fund matter, the White
House said for the first time that it
was former special counsel Charles W.
Colson who told Nixon that the
nation's largest dairy co-operative had
promised $2 million to Nixon's
campaign.
And the ITT statement left
standing some apparent conflicts
between what Nixon now says and
what former attorneys general John N.
Mitchell and Richard G. Kleindienst
once said under oath about their own
roles.
Describing Colson's role in the
dairy matter, the White House said he
wrote a memo to brief Nixon for a
meeting on Sept. 9, 1970, with Harold
Nelson and David Parr, two leaders of
the Texas-based Associated Milk
Producers, Inc.
$2 Million Pledge
Colson said "that AMPI had
pledged $2 million to the 1972
campaign," the White House said.
"It was suggested in the
memorandum that the President
acknowledge AMPl's support. No
suggestion was made that any
commitment whatsoever be made to
do any substantive act."
The White House said Nixon didn't
take Colson's advice, and kept silent
about the $2-million promise in his
nine-minute meeting with Nelson and
Parr.
Watergate Prosecutors
Colson's memo, and others dealing
with the milk producers, are in the
hands of the Watergate special
prosecution force. The Senate

Watergate committee is seeking the
same documents, apparently with no
success.
Committee lawyers would like to
question Colson, but he has declined
on previous occasions to testify before
the Senate panel unless he is granted
immunity from prosecution.
Colson could not be reached
yesterday for comment on the White
House description of his role.
In the ITT matter, the White House
expanded on what Nixon said in a

news conference last November before
The Associated Press Managing Editors
Association.
It said Nixon ordered a temporary
halt in antitrust proceedings against
the huge conglomerate prior to ITT's
offer to help finance the Republican
National Convention.
And it said Nixon was motivated to
stop the case, which was headed for
the Supreme Court, because he
disagreed with antitrust chief Richard
