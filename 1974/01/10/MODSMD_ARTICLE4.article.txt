An explanation of campus information resources and
a defense of the value of a liberal arts education are
included in a newly published book entitled, A Stanford
Education.
"The University has switched to a curriculum that
allows students a great amount of choice in the planning
of their programs," explained Douglas Davis, associate
dean of undergraduate studies, who supervised
production of the 128-page book.
"Many students to whom I speak say that they have
had problems making decisions on their own. There is
quite a bit of evidence that they select courses in a hurry
without realizing how courses relate to one another.
"The book is designed to provide information to
students without limiting their choices. It should help
students size up their targets and see what it takes to get
the kind of education they desire."
The first half of the book discusses the merits of a
general liberal arts education, with short essays written
by Stanford faculty members, students and alumni.
"Without strong and thrustful programs in the liberal
arts, all the vocational skills in the world won't solve our
problems, either individually or as a society," University
President Richard Lyman declares in one essay.
The second half of the book explains the academic
services available on campus, especially those offered at
the Academic Information Center on the third floor of
the Old Union. It also discusses the facilities at the
Career Planning and Placement Center and the Bechtel
International Center.
A Stanford Education also explains the advantages

and disadvantages of obtaining a degree in three years ■
and offers advice on choosing a major and selecting a
career.
The last several pages are devoted to last year's senior
survey, and includes lists of the graduate schools where
Stanford students applied, the number of graduates
accepted and the academic standards of the institutions.
"The booklet isn't intended to stand by itself. We are
hoping that it will trigger dialogue on campus between
students and faculty members," Davis commented. "Wo
do not expect students to read it from cover to cover.
We hope they will read passages that are of special
interest to them."
Davis said the need for such a book became apparent
nearly three years ago, and the general approach of the
book was developed in the autumn of 1972. The
decision to produce the book was made by the
Subcommittee on Advising of the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
"We tried to get a representative sampling of
opinion," Davis said. "But of course we couldn't get a
perfect balance of opinion. There are, for example, no
essays by women students. Although we asked some to
write, none contributed."
Davis added that one problem in the production of
the book was that people asked to write essays weren't
sure of what was expected of them. If any future
editions are published, this will probably not be a
problem, he predicted.
The books will be available to students within the
next two weeks, either in the dorms or at the Academic
Information Center, Davis said.

services available on campus, especially those offered at
the Academic Information Center on the third floor of
the Old Union. It also discusses the facilities at the
Career Planning and Placement Center and the Bechtel
International Center.
A Stanford Education also explains the advantages

and disadvantages of obtaining a degree in three years ■
and offers advice on choosing a major and selecting a
career.
The last several pages are devoted to last year's senior
survey, and includes lists of the graduate schools where
Stanford students applied, the number of graduates
accepted and the academic standards of the institutions.
"The booklet isn't intended to stand by itself. We are
hoping that it will trigger dialogue on campus between
students and faculty members," Davis commented. "Wo
do not expect students to read it from cover to cover.
We hope they will read passages that are of special
interest to them."
Davis said the need for such a book became apparent
nearly three years ago, and the general approach of the
book was developed in the autumn of 1972. The
decision to produce the book was made by the
Subcommittee on Advising of the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
"We tried to get a representative sampling of
opinion," Davis said. "But of course we couldn't get a
perfect balance of opinion. There are, for example, no
essays by women students. Although we asked some to
write, none contributed."
Davis added that one problem in the production of
the book was that people asked to write essays weren't
sure of what was expected of them. If any future
editions are published, this will probably not be a
problem, he predicted.
The books will be available to students within the
next two weeks, either in the dorms or at the Academic
Information Center, Davis said.
An explanation of campus information resources and
a defense of the value of a liberal arts education are
included in a newly published book entitled, A Stanford
Education.
"The University has switched to a curriculum that
allows students a great amount of choice in the planning
of their programs," explained Douglas Davis, associate
dean of undergraduate studies, who supervised
production of the 128-page book.
"Many students to whom I speak say that they have
had problems making decisions on their own. There is
quite a bit of evidence that they select courses in a hurry
without realizing how courses relate to one another.
"The book is designed to provide information to
students without limiting their choices. It should help
students size up their targets and see what it takes to get
the kind of education they desire."
The first half of the book discusses the merits of a
general liberal arts education, with short essays written
by Stanford faculty members, students and alumni.
"Without strong and thrustful programs in the liberal
arts, all the vocational skills in the world won't solve our
problems, either individually or as a society," University
President Richard Lyman declares in one essay.
The second half of the book explains the academic
services available on campus, especially those offered at

the Old Union. It also discusses the facilities at the
