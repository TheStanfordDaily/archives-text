# Local Schools To Open One Half flour Later

### GLENN KRAMON 
Children of Stanford families will
join many other Bay Area pupils in
beginning school one half hour later
starting next Tuesday.
The decision to move back classes,
rendered by Dr. Harold T. Santee,
superintendent of the Palo Alto
Unified School District, came after a
public outcry about the danger of
children traveling to school in
darkness.
Children have been walking and
riding bicycles to school before
daylight since the country returned to
daylight savings time earlier this week.
The change in school hours, which
delays the whole school day one half
hour, will affect kindergarteners
through twelfth graders and remain in
force until Friday, Feb. 15. Schools

will then return to their present
starting times because the sun will rise
earlier.
Schools in the Palo Alto district
presently begin between 8 and 9 a.m.
Assistant to the Superintendent
Jack Alexander last night attributed
the move to "parental complaints
about the increased possibility of
accidents, particularly among the
younger children," due to the
decreased visibility caused by lack of
light.
One concerned parent, Rosemary
Killam of Escondido Village, said that
in a survey of 71 of the approximately
179 Stanford families with children in
Terman Junior High School,
approximately 60 percent favored the
move to push back the beginning of
classes. She noted that 27 percent
opposed the decision.
Killam also expressed concern over
recent attacks on Los Altos and
Cupertino school girls during the
darker morning hours. She said she
would mention the need for better
lighting in Escondido Village at the
Jan. 24 meeting of Escondido
residents who have children in Terman
Junior High School.
Alexander theorized that
opposition to the earlier daylight
savings times stemmed from concern
among working and student parents
"about leaving kids unattended at
home for the extra half hour instead of
having them on the way to, or in,
school."
Ironically, many more parents have
been driving their children to school in
the last week because of the darker

mornings, Alexander said.
Consequently, energy consumption
has probably increased among that
category of motorists.
"Also, if you delay closing of the
schools by half an hour, you'll
interfere with jobs, appointments and
extra-curricular activities, particularly
on the high school level," Alexander
said.
But he insisted that "safety of the
children is our principal concern."
