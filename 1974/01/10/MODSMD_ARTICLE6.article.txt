# Cowell Adds Gynecologist To Its Staff
## 
### MARY PICKETT 
Dr. Norman Fisk has joined the
Cowell Health Center staff as a
half-time gynecologist filling the
vacancy left by Dr. Sue Ellen Massey's
resignation last October.
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
the student health center, said Fisk, a
Palo Alto gynecologist and
psychiatrist, is at Cowell five mornings
a week.
Beth Garfield, ASSU vice president
and member of the Task Force on
Women's Medical Care which had
pressured the health center to hire a
full-time gynecologist, said, "The Task
Force was not pleased the new
gynecologist was a man. Because
women students are more at ease with
a female physician, we would have
preferred a woman hired for the
position."
However, she said, "The Task Force
is in suspension at this time in terms of
any further action about the Cowell
gynecologist. We want to wait and see
if the waiting period for gynecological
care is longer than a week."
Prompt Contraceptive Care
McClenahan said that although it
was hard to tell in the
beginning-of-the-quarter rush, he felt a
student could receive contraceptive
care within a week after calling in for
an appointment. "People with
problems are seen the same day they
come in," he added.
High Quality Care
The quality of gynecological
services for Stanford students,
McClenahan said, is, "compared to the
community and other campuses, very
adequate here.
"Problems did come up last fall
when Dr. Massey had to leave, but
with our regular staff and the addition
of Dr. Fisk, we can handle the load,"
said McClenahan.
Commenting on the progress of the
suggestions presented by the Task
Force last fall, McClenahan said that
peer group counseling, gynecological
care for non-student partners of
Stanford students and more sex and
contraception information were "still
open."
