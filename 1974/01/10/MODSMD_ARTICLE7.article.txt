# Where Is The Best Food?
## Campus Meals Differ 
### 
(Sophomore Sandy White was sent on
a mission to assess various campus
eating styles. The first part of her
results appears below.)
Your mother raised you on "brain
food" so you could become a genius
and a doctor. After 18 years of liver,
chicken soup, eating all your
vegetables, and apple pie that couldn't
be beat, you've developed that
well-nourished mind. So here you are
at Stanford. But you don't have
Mom's home cooking to sustain you
anymore.
All former ideas about food
crumble with the first food service
meal. After the initial assault on one's
senses, a student learns to judge food
by new criteria. Where meat used to be
juicy, tender, or flavorful, it is now
mercifully drowned in tomato sauce or
gravy. Vegetables, once scorned
because of trad taste, now deliver a
deadlier torture — no taste — or flavor
or color, for that matter. And if all
this weren't enough, one must
regularly submit to the hasher's
demand to "show me your meal card."
Except for the freshmen and those
who draw bad numbers, the food
service is not inevitable. Students can
choose from houses or eating clubs
with their own cooks, co-ops, or do it
themselves in a trailer or apartment. A
person's choice may be determined by
his budget, his cooking ability or lack
thereof, or his feelings about organic
and vegetarian food.
Many Differences
A visit to some of the different
dining rooms on campus brings some
interesting differences to light. The
chaotic atmosphere of a co-op is less
elegant, perhaps, than a stately
sit-down dinner on the Row, but
either one seems homier than the huge
Branner dining hall. At some small
houses, one can order breakfast
cooked on the spot, while some of the
Stern food service selections look as
though they came through rain, snow,
and dark of night before they were
reheated. In some co-ops, each person
rinses his own dishes, but on the Row,
the hashers clear the tables.
Many mysterious stories circulate
about the food service, often centering
on the origin of the food. A
frequently-encountered myth is that
the Wilbur kitchen prepares all the
food for the other dorms, and so keeps
the best food for itself. Wilbur does
bake all the cakes, cookies, rolls, etc.,
for the other food services. It supplies
hot food to Roble and Branner,
because their kitchens are small.

Sandy White

A recent Roble lunch of creamed
chipped beef on toast served as a poor
recommendation for reheated food,
but the salad bar made up for it. Roble
was the only dorm which offered
garbanzo beans and caesar dressing in
addition to the standard fare.
Some Are Better
Although all food service dorms
offer the same menus, some are
reputed to be better. The only way to
successfully compare the big three —
Stern, Wilbur, and Flo Mo — is to
sample the same meal at each one.
Since a meal card is good at any
branch of the food service, it is
possible to eat several dinners in one
evening. It is also masochistic and
guaranteed to cause indigestion to do
so.
A Sunday dinner included: pork
chops or chicken a la king, green
beans, salad, and cake. Each food
service added its own embellishments:
leftover zucchini at Flo Mo,
cauliflowers and cardboard cherry pie
at Wilbur. But the differences in the
main itdms were noticeable 1 . Although
both Wilbur and Flo Mo had breaded
and baked the pork chops, at Wilbur
they were crispy outside and moist
inside, and at Flo Mo they were soggy
outside and dry inside. Stern's offering
was dry and tough, and the
orange-colored barbeque sauce
congealed nicely on top.
The beans were no better. Stern's
were hardly recognizable, but
fortunately they were labeled. They
were odorless, colorless, flavorless, and
mushy. At Flo Mo and Wilbur, they
were still tasteless, but at least they
were not overcooked. Wilbur added
sliced almonds, giving some flavor
appeal. Even the beverages differed.
Orange soda at Stern tasted like
children's aspirin, but at Flo Mo it was
watered down.
Overall, then, for this one meal,
Stern's food was the worst and
Wilbur's the best. Another meal at
Stern featured greasy hamburgers with
protein additive, but a breakfast at
Wilbur was no better. So it is uncertain
how far these judgments can be
generalized. But it is interesting to
note the attitudes of students in their
residences. Except for co-op members,
all will.claim that a visitor has picked a
terrible meal to sample. These
apologies are discouraging — it is good
to visit a co-op, where everyone is
responsible for the food.
(The conclusion will appear tomorrow
on this page.)

Although all food service dorms
offer the same menus, some are
reputed to be better. The only way to
successfully compare the big three —
Stern, Wilbur, and Flo Mo — is to
sample the same meal at each one.
Since a meal card is good at any
branch of the food service, it is
possible to eat several dinners in one
evening. It is also masochistic and
guaranteed to cause indigestion to do
so.
A Sunday dinner included: pork
chops or chicken a la king, green
beans, salad, and cake. Each food
service added its own embellishments:
leftover zucchini at Flo Mo,
cauliflowers and cardboard cherry pie
at Wilbur. But the differences in the
main itdms were noticeable 1 . Although
both Wilbur and Flo Mo had breaded
and baked the pork chops, at Wilbur
they were crispy outside and moist
inside, and at Flo Mo they were soggy
outside and dry inside. Stern's offering
was dry and tough, and the
orange-colored barbeque sauce
congealed nicely on top.
The beans were no better. Stern's
were hardly recognizable, but
fortunately they were labeled. They
were odorless, colorless, flavorless, and
mushy. At Flo Mo and Wilbur, they
were still tasteless, but at least they
were not overcooked. Wilbur added
sliced almonds, giving some flavor
appeal. Even the beverages differed.
Orange soda at Stern tasted like
children's aspirin, but at Flo Mo it was
watered down.
Overall, then, for this one meal,
Stern's food was the worst and
Wilbur's the best. Another meal at
Stern featured greasy hamburgers with
protein additive, but a breakfast at
Wilbur was no better. So it is uncertain
how far these judgments can be
generalized. But it is interesting to
note the attitudes of students in their
residences. Except for co-op members,
all will.claim that a visitor has picked a
terrible meal to sample. These
apologies are discouraging — it is good
to visit a co-op, where everyone is
responsible for the food.

eating styles. The first part of her

Your mother raised you on "brain
food" so you could become a genius
and a doctor. After 18 years of liver,
chicken soup, eating all your
vegetables, and apple pie that couldn't
be beat, you've developed that
well-nourished mind. So here you are
at Stanford. But you don't have
Mom's home cooking to sustain you
anymore.
All former ideas about food
crumble with the first food service
meal. After the initial assault on one's
senses, a student learns to judge food
by new criteria. Where meat used to be
juicy, tender, or flavorful, it is now
mercifully drowned in tomato sauce or
gravy. Vegetables, once scorned
because of trad taste, now deliver a
deadlier torture — no taste — or flavor
or color, for that matter. And if all
this weren't enough, one must
regularly submit to the hasher's
demand to "show me your meal card."
Except for the freshmen and those
who draw bad numbers, the food
service is not inevitable. Students can
choose from houses or eating clubs
with their own cooks, co-ops, or do it
themselves in a trailer or apartment. A
person's choice may be determined by
his budget, his cooking ability or lack
thereof, or his feelings about organic
and vegetarian food.
Many Differences
A visit to some of the different
dining rooms on campus brings some
interesting differences to light. The
chaotic atmosphere of a co-op is less
elegant, perhaps, than a stately
sit-down dinner on the Row, but
either one seems homier than the huge
Branner dining hall. At some small
houses, one can order breakfast
cooked on the spot, while some of the
Stern food service selections look as
though they came through rain, snow,
and dark of night before they were
reheated. In some co-ops, each person
rinses his own dishes, but on the Row,
the hashers clear the tables.
Many mysterious stories circulate
about the food service, often centering
on the origin of the food. A
frequently-encountered myth is that
the Wilbur kitchen prepares all the
food for the other dorms, and so keeps
the best food for itself. Wilbur does
bake all the cakes, cookies, rolls, etc.,
for the other food services. It supplies
hot food to Roble and Branner,
because their kitchens are small.

Sandy White

A recent Roble lunch of creamed
chipped beef on toast served as a poor
recommendation for reheated food,
but the salad bar made up for it. Roble
was the only dorm which offered
garbanzo beans and caesar dressing in
addition to the standard fare.

juicy, tender, or flavorful, it is now
mercifully drowned in tomato sauce or
gravy. Vegetables, once scorned
because of trad taste, now deliver a
deadlier torture — no taste — or flavor
or color, for that matter. And if all
this weren't enough, one must
regularly submit to the hasher's
demand to "show me your meal card."
Except for the freshmen and those
who draw bad numbers, the food
service is not inevitable. Students can
choose from houses or eating clubs
with their own cooks, co-ops, or do it
themselves in a trailer or apartment. A
person's choice may be determined by
his budget, his cooking ability or lack
thereof, or his feelings about organic
and vegetarian food.
Many Differences
A visit to some of the different
dining rooms on campus brings some
interesting differences to light. The
chaotic atmosphere of a co-op is less
elegant, perhaps, than a stately
sit-down dinner on the Row, but
either one seems homier than the huge
Branner dining hall. At some small
houses, one can order breakfast
cooked on the spot, while some of the
Stern food service selections look as
though they came through rain, snow,
and dark of night before they were
reheated. In some co-ops, each person
rinses his own dishes, but on the Row,
the hashers clear the tables.
Many mysterious stories circulate
about the food service, often centering
on the origin of the food. A
frequently-encountered myth is that
the Wilbur kitchen prepares all the
food for the other dorms, and so keeps
the best food for itself. Wilbur does
bake all the cakes, cookies, rolls, etc.,
for the other food services. It supplies
hot food to Roble and Branner,
because their kitchens are small.

A recent Roble lunch of creamed
chipped beef on toast served as a poor
recommendation for reheated food,
but the salad bar made up for it. Roble
was the only dorm which offered
garbanzo beans and caesar dressing in
addition to the standard fare.
Some Are Better
Although all food service dorms
offer the same menus, some are
reputed to be better. The only way to
successfully compare the big three —
Stern, Wilbur, and Flo Mo — is to
sample the same meal at each one.
Since a meal card is good at any
branch of the food service, it is
possible to eat several dinners in one
evening. It is also masochistic and
guaranteed to cause indigestion to do
so.
A Sunday dinner included: pork
chops or chicken a la king, green
beans, salad, and cake. Each food
service added its own embellishments:
leftover zucchini at Flo Mo,
cauliflowers and cardboard cherry pie
at Wilbur. But the differences in the
main itdms were noticeable 1 . Although
both Wilbur and Flo Mo had breaded
and baked the pork chops, at Wilbur
they were crispy outside and moist
inside, and at Flo Mo they were soggy
outside and dry inside. Stern's offering
was dry and tough, and the
orange-colored barbeque sauce
congealed nicely on top.
The beans were no better. Stern's
were hardly recognizable, but
fortunately they were labeled. They
were odorless, colorless, flavorless, and
mushy. At Flo Mo and Wilbur, they
were still tasteless, but at least they
were not overcooked. Wilbur added
sliced almonds, giving some flavor
appeal. Even the beverages differed.
Orange soda at Stern tasted like
children's aspirin, but at Flo Mo it was
watered down.
Overall, then, for this one meal,
Stern's food was the worst and
Wilbur's the best. Another meal at
Stern featured greasy hamburgers with
protein additive, but a breakfast at
Wilbur was no better. So it is uncertain
how far these judgments can be
generalized. But it is interesting to
note the attitudes of students in their
residences. Except for co-op members,
all will.claim that a visitor has picked a
terrible meal to sample. These
apologies are discouraging — it is good
to visit a co-op, where everyone is
responsible for the food.

(Sophomore Sandy White was sent on
a mission to assess various campus
eating styles. The first part of her
results appears below.)
Your mother raised you on "brain
food" so you could become a genius
and a doctor. After 18 years of liver,
chicken soup, eating all your
vegetables, and apple pie that couldn't
be beat, you've developed that
well-nourished mind. So here you are
at Stanford. But you don't have
Mom's home cooking to sustain you
anymore.
All former ideas about food
crumble with the first food service
meal. After the initial assault on one's
senses, a student learns to judge food
by new criteria. Where meat used to be
juicy, tender, or flavorful, it is now
mercifully drowned in tomato sauce or
gravy. Vegetables, once scorned
because of trad taste, now deliver a
