# Stop ROTC
## Military On Campus? 
### 
Lenny Siegel

Will the Reserve Officers Training Corps make a comeback at Stanford? Who
cares?
There is clearly no groundswell for ROTC at Stanford. I could get more
students to sign a petition that Hoover tower be clothed.
But ROTC is not a dead issue. The Pentagon wants it back. The New York
Times reported (Oct. 25, 1973), "ROTC Officers concede that the colleges they
have lost — Harvard, Stanford, and Columbia, among others — are the ones they
would most like to have, both for their symbolic value and for the quality of
their students."
It is easy to see why the Pentagon wants to enlist such prestigious universities.
It may help stem the tide of anti-military sentiment in the U.S.
Qualifications
But why are Stanford students so qualified for military leadership? Is it
because they will humanize the military?
Hardly. In the later years of the Indochina War, servicemen of all ranks and
background were refusing to fight. A few were officers. Some were probably
from upper class universities. But the bulk were not.
Besides, the men who issued the orders to bomb cities, farms, and villages
throughout Indochina were not "redneck" drill instructors. They included
sophisticates such as Harvard's Henry Kissinger. And young Stanford graduates
like Don Segretti are not likely to improve our government's record.
Technical Personnel
No. The military wants Stanford students because Stanford produces more
qualified technical and scientific personnel. Despite all the talk about a volunteer
army, the major thrust of direct U.S. military activity is automation. To
maintain and operate the electronic battlefield and unmanned aircraft, the
military needs technically competent officers. Schools like Stanford, with strong
science and engineering curricula, play a major role.
But is ROTC all that important now? How about the cease-fire?
The withdrawal of American ground troops from Indochina was a victory for
the anti-war movement, but the fighting continues with massive U.S. aid.
Furthermore, around the world the U.S. military still maintains an apparatus
capable of intervening to serve "American interests." Short of intervention, the
U.S. trains military leaders from some 65 countries and maintains advisory teams
in more than 10. ROTC helps keep this military machine functioning.
Part of the Mood
It is difficult to imagine a new, large-scale American intervention overseas at
present. The mood of the country, it seems, will not permit it. But we are a part
of that mood, and if the campuses "return to the 19505," one important
obstacle to American aggression will be gone.
At the end of finals week 35 people protested ROTC outside the academic
senate. We'll be back at the business school, with more people, today at 3 p.m.

students to sign a petition that Hoover tower be clothed.
But ROTC is not a dead issue. The Pentagon wants it back. The New York
Times reported (Oct. 25, 1973), "ROTC Officers concede that the colleges they
have lost — Harvard, Stanford, and Columbia, among others — are the ones they
would most like to have, both for their symbolic value and for the quality of
their students."
It is easy to see why the Pentagon wants to enlist such prestigious universities.
It may help stem the tide of anti-military sentiment in the U.S.
Qualifications
But why are Stanford students so qualified for military leadership? Is it
because they will humanize the military?
Hardly. In the later years of the Indochina War, servicemen of all ranks and
background were refusing to fight. A few were officers. Some were probably
from upper class universities. But the bulk were not.
Besides, the men who issued the orders to bomb cities, farms, and villages
throughout Indochina were not "redneck" drill instructors. They included
sophisticates such as Harvard's Henry Kissinger. And young Stanford graduates
like Don Segretti are not likely to improve our government's record.
Technical Personnel
No. The military wants Stanford students because Stanford produces more
qualified technical and scientific personnel. Despite all the talk about a volunteer
army, the major thrust of direct U.S. military activity is automation. To
maintain and operate the electronic battlefield and unmanned aircraft, the
military needs technically competent officers. Schools like Stanford, with strong
science and engineering curricula, play a major role.
But is ROTC all that important now? How about the cease-fire?
The withdrawal of American ground troops from Indochina was a victory for
the anti-war movement, but the fighting continues with massive U.S. aid.
Furthermore, around the world the U.S. military still maintains an apparatus
capable of intervening to serve "American interests." Short of intervention, the
U.S. trains military leaders from some 65 countries and maintains advisory teams
in more than 10. ROTC helps keep this military machine functioning.
Part of the Mood
It is difficult to imagine a new, large-scale American intervention overseas at
present. The mood of the country, it seems, will not permit it. But we are a part
of that mood, and if the campuses "return to the 19505," one important
obstacle to American aggression will be gone.
At the end of finals week 35 people protested ROTC outside the academic
senate. We'll be back at the business school, with more people, today at 3 p.m.

Will the Reserve Officers Training Corps make a comeback at Stanford? Who
cares?
There is clearly no groundswell for ROTC at Stanford. I could get more
students to sign a petition that Hoover tower be clothed.
