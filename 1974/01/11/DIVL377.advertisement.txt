!* Little Jimmy Wascher, and dozens like him on the Daily staff, need your help. "*
I* " es got a dream — a dream that someday his newspaper will be the best around — «'
< that everyone will read the paper, and like it.
* But without help there's no hope for Jimmy. Right now the Daily just doesn't «'
k have the manpower to cover every news, feature, entertainment, sports, and
k photo assignment. So poor Jimmy is practically dying of overwork. What can cure
him? Only you. Come to a meeting for new staffers today at 1 p.m. in the Daily
t office, Storke Student Publications Building.
