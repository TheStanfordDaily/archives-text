# Augsburger Emphasizes Academic Facilities
## New Land Use Policy Proposed 
### BILL ROSS 
University land should be regarded
as an academic resource rather than as
a financial investment, Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, declared yesterday.
The purpose of the land "is to
provide the space to accommodate
academic facilities rather than being a
financial asset to be used to support
the University," Augsburger said.
A statement on "Proposed Land
Use Policy" sent by Augsburger and
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig to
the Board of Trustees' Land and
Building Committee for discussion
emphasized that new land
development should be tied to
Stanford's academic program.
"This is clearly a matter that's
within the prerogative of the Board of
Trustees," Augsburger said. Hopefully,
the committee will be prepared to
report on the paper at the March 12
meeting of the Board of Trustees, he
added.
Change In Plans
Augsburger said the new policy
would preclude the starting of several
types of developments that have
occurred here in recent years, such as
free market housing and retail
businesses.
"This isn't any attempt to deny the
past," Augsburger explained. "What
has been done in the last 20 years was
in most cases appropriate. What we're
attempting to do is to look at what is
to be most appropriate for the
University in the future."
Although full commercial
utilization of vacant lands at Stanford
would increase Stanford's endowment

by about $35 million — ten percent of
its present $342 million — keeping the
lands open for future generations is
more important than expanding the
endowment, Augsburger stated.
When the existing policy of using
land for income-producing purposes
started in the early 1950'5, Stanford
had an annual operating budget of $7
million, compared to $73 million
today. The University was attempting
to build itself into an international
research center, Augsburger explained.
But today, with the University greatly
expanded, the relative importance of
the land as a source of income has
declined.
'Unique Position'
"The availability of an 8100 acre
'campus' places Stanford University in
a unique position among American
universities," the land use policy
statement draft declares. "Of the
major research institutions, only a few,
including Stanford, still offer some
breathing space."
Stanford should learn a lesson from
the experience of Yale and Harvard,
Augsburger warned. Those universities
have antagonized local communities
by expanding into surrounding towns
and displacing revenue-producing
property.
"We don't want to find people here
in a hundred years in the kind of
position Harvard and Yale are in
today," Augsburger remarked. "It is
important to preserve flexibility."
Some of the buildings leased by the
University to commercial concerns will
be torn down when the leases expire,
while others will be used for teaching
or research, Augsburger predicted.

Rosenzweig emphasized that the
policy statement is not motivated by
Santa Clara County's proposed "cs"
zone, which would extend the control
of Palo Alto over the Stanford
campus.
The University's policy developed
long before the emergence of the "cs"
zone issue, Rosenzweig said. But
because the conflict over the "cs"
zone is due in part to the uncertainty
and fear of Palo Alto regarding
Stanford's development plans, the
University's new proposal should
reduce apprehension, he observed.

ROTC PR OTEST—About 85 demonstrators picketed the Faculty Senate meeting yesterday to protest the discussion of
possible reinstatement of the ROTC program on campus. The Senate decided not to make any decisions on the matter at
this point in time.
