# Campus Dining Experiences
## Remember Mom's Homemade Apple Pie? 
### 
(Continued from yesterday, this is the
conclusion of an assessment of various
campus eating styles.)
Theta Chi, Synergy, Columbae,
Jordan, Terra (Ecology House), and
one eating club, the Breakers, are
co-ops. They are much cheaper — up
to $100 less — than the food service.
Many are at least semi-vegetarian. At
Synergy there is always supposed to be
one vegetarian dish, but often, instead
of preparing two menus, the whole
meal is vegetarian. It is one of the few
places on campus where chopsticks are
offered as an alternative to silverware.
Many co-ops bake their own bread
and granola every night. That usually
means fresh bread for breakfast, butt
people in Terra usually gather in the
kitchen at night to "taste" the new
bread. If it is banana or nut bread, it
might be gone by moming. So the 50

cent Terra breakfast can either be
great or meager, depending on the
bread situation. However, granola and
yogurt are always plentiful, and there's
usually a box of organic-looking fruit.
Since co-op food is low-budget, it
consists mainly of fruit, vegetables,
cereals, and rice. Cheese and nuts are
protein sources. But a Synergy dinner
of curry and rice was not very filling,
although there was plenty of food.
Some people eagerly join co-ops, only
to discover that they miss the
meat-and-potatoes routine. But those
who like co-ops enthusiastically dream
of dishes like vegetarian pizza "with
40 kinds of vegetables all over it."
Individual Cooks
Many students choose houses,
fraternities, or eating clubs, which
have their own cooks. Menu selection
varies with the individual cooks and
the budgets they are given. A Whitman
House dinner was almost like a
co-op's: beef and vegetable stew, rice
with orange peels, green salad, and
steaming cornbread.
One lunch at El Tigre, an eating
club, brought the peculiar
combination of split pea soup, hot
dogs, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes,
and sweet rolls. Club members insisted
that this was a rare case, and ranked it
3 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Even though the row houses are
part of the food service, their cooks
have more flexibility than those in the
dorms. The intimacy of a Sunday

brunch, where the cook fixes whatever
you like, is a far cry from the morning
mob of sleepwalkers at Wilbur. Since
the small houses usually only serve 40
or so at a meal, the food tastes more
like home.
Rowdy Atmosphere
The all-male eating club, El Toro,
boasts not only a good cook, Tommy,
but also one of the rowdiest dinner
atmospheres on campus. This group
had such spirit that they feted a
member's birthday by dumping a
bucket of water on his head.
Whatever atmosphere seems most
appealing, certain statements are true
all over campus. First of all, every
house serves granola for breakfast, and
often other favorites such as grape
nuts or frosted flakes.
In fact, breakfasts are generally
good. Most co-ops and some
independent houses have open kitchen
— each person fixes his own. Food
services usually offer hot cereal and
eggs or pancakes. Grove House and a
few others offer short-order
breakfasts. Mr. Lim at ATO is a master
in this class. He serves bacon, sausage,
pancakes, eggs, french toast, cereal,
fruit, juice and coffee every day for
only 95 cents. Each slice of french
toast is golden and light, each pancake
perfectly round.
The Best For Last
Desserts and pastries are also
reliably good. The appearance of
jamoca almond fudge ice cream

Sandy White

usually causes a stampede, and
Velma's apple crunch is a favorite at
Durand. From baklava at the coffee
house, to sweet rolls at Wilbur,
something sweet and fattening is
always available.
It would be difficult to starve or
suffer from malnutrition in a Stanford
residence. The four magic food groups
are always represented, though more
starches are available than anything
else. Although many students go to
Cowell with stomach trouble, doctors
feel that the cause is usually viral, not
food-related. There have been no cases
of food poisoning in recent years.
Costs per quarter are about $300
for 19 meals a week from the food
service. Co-op costs range from
$100-$l5O per quarter, while most
other houses and eating clubs cost
between $250-$3OO. Smaller plans can
be purchased, too.
Those who cook for themselves can
spend a little or a lot, according to
how well they can plan ahead, what
they eat, and how often they burn the
T.V. dinners and have to go out.
Nightly runs to Jack-in-the-Box or
Round Table will up anyone's food
bill.
So if you are what you eat, what is
a Stanford student? 18 years of home
cooking tempered with chili mac and
Chinese tomato beef add up to an
unknown quantity.

40 kinds of vegetables all over it."
Individual Cooks
Many students choose houses,
fraternities, or eating clubs, which
have their own cooks. Menu selection
varies with the individual cooks and
the budgets they are given. A Whitman
House dinner was almost like a
co-op's: beef and vegetable stew, rice
with orange peels, green salad, and
steaming cornbread.
One lunch at El Tigre, an eating
club, brought the peculiar
combination of split pea soup, hot
dogs, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes,
and sweet rolls. Club members insisted
that this was a rare case, and ranked it
3 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Even though the row houses are
part of the food service, their cooks
have more flexibility than those in the
dorms. The intimacy of a Sunday

brunch, where the cook fixes whatever
you like, is a far cry from the morning
mob of sleepwalkers at Wilbur. Since
the small houses usually only serve 40
or so at a meal, the food tastes more
like home.
Rowdy Atmosphere
The all-male eating club, El Toro,
boasts not only a good cook, Tommy,
but also one of the rowdiest dinner
atmospheres on campus. This group
had such spirit that they feted a
member's birthday by dumping a
bucket of water on his head.
Whatever atmosphere seems most
appealing, certain statements are true
all over campus. First of all, every
house serves granola for breakfast, and
often other favorites such as grape
nuts or frosted flakes.
In fact, breakfasts are generally
good. Most co-ops and some
independent houses have open kitchen
— each person fixes his own. Food
services usually offer hot cereal and
eggs or pancakes. Grove House and a
few others offer short-order
breakfasts. Mr. Lim at ATO is a master
in this class. He serves bacon, sausage,
pancakes, eggs, french toast, cereal,
fruit, juice and coffee every day for
only 95 cents. Each slice of french
toast is golden and light, each pancake
perfectly round.
The Best For Last
Desserts and pastries are also
reliably good. The appearance of
jamoca almond fudge ice cream

Sandy White

usually causes a stampede, and
Velma's apple crunch is a favorite at
Durand. From baklava at the coffee
house, to sweet rolls at Wilbur,
something sweet and fattening is
always available.
It would be difficult to starve or
suffer from malnutrition in a Stanford
residence. The four magic food groups
are always represented, though more
starches are available than anything
else. Although many students go to
Cowell with stomach trouble, doctors
feel that the cause is usually viral, not
food-related. There have been no cases
of food poisoning in recent years.
Costs per quarter are about $300
for 19 meals a week from the food
service. Co-op costs range from
$100-$l5O per quarter, while most
other houses and eating clubs cost
between $250-$3OO. Smaller plans can
be purchased, too.
Those who cook for themselves can
spend a little or a lot, according to
how well they can plan ahead, what
they eat, and how often they burn the
T.V. dinners and have to go out.
Nightly runs to Jack-in-the-Box or
Round Table will up anyone's food
bill.
So if you are what you eat, what is
a Stanford student? 18 years of home
cooking tempered with chili mac and
Chinese tomato beef add up to an
unknown quantity.
(Sandy White is a sophomore.)
(Continued from yesterday, this is the
conclusion of an assessment of various
campus eating styles.)
Theta Chi, Synergy, Columbae,
Jordan, Terra (Ecology House), and
one eating club, the Breakers, are
co-ops. They are much cheaper — up
to $100 less — than the food service.
Many are at least semi-vegetarian. At
Synergy there is always supposed to be
one vegetarian dish, but often, instead
of preparing two menus, the whole
meal is vegetarian. It is one of the few
places on campus where chopsticks are
offered as an alternative to silverware.
Many co-ops bake their own bread
and granola every night. That usually
means fresh bread for breakfast, butt
people in Terra usually gather in the
kitchen at night to "taste" the new
bread. If it is banana or nut bread, it
might be gone by moming. So the 50

cent Terra breakfast can either be
great or meager, depending on the
bread situation. However, granola and
yogurt are always plentiful, and there's
usually a box of organic-looking fruit.
Since co-op food is low-budget, it
consists mainly of fruit, vegetables,
cereals, and rice. Cheese and nuts are
protein sources. But a Synergy dinner
of curry and rice was not very filling,
although there was plenty of food.
Some people eagerly join co-ops, only
to discover that they miss the
meat-and-potatoes routine. But those
who like co-ops enthusiastically dream
of dishes like vegetarian pizza "with
40 kinds of vegetables all over it."

nuts or frosted flakes.
In fact, breakfasts are generally
good. Most co-ops and some
independent houses have open kitchen
— each person fixes his own. Food
services usually offer hot cereal and
eggs or pancakes. Grove House and a
few others offer short-order
breakfasts. Mr. Lim at ATO is a master
in this class. He serves bacon, sausage,
pancakes, eggs, french toast, cereal,
fruit, juice and coffee every day for
only 95 cents. Each slice of french
toast is golden and light, each pancake
perfectly round.

Desserts and pastries are also

usually causes a stampede, and
Velma's apple crunch is a favorite at
Durand. From baklava at the coffee
house, to sweet rolls at Wilbur,
something sweet and fattening is
always available.
It would be difficult to starve or
suffer from malnutrition in a Stanford
residence. The four magic food groups
are always represented, though more
starches are available than anything
else. Although many students go to
Cowell with stomach trouble, doctors
feel that the cause is usually viral, not
food-related. There have been no cases
of food poisoning in recent years.
Costs per quarter are about $300
for 19 meals a week from the food
service. Co-op costs range from
$100-$l5O per quarter, while most
other houses and eating clubs cost
between $250-$3OO. Smaller plans can
be purchased, too.
Those who cook for themselves can
spend a little or a lot, according to
how well they can plan ahead, what
they eat, and how often they burn the
T.V. dinners and have to go out.
Nightly runs to Jack-in-the-Box or
Round Table will up anyone's food
bill.
So if you are what you eat, what is
a Stanford student? 18 years of home
cooking tempered with chili mac and
Chinese tomato beef add up to an
unknown quantity.

(Continued from yesterday, this is the
conclusion of an assessment of various
campus eating styles.)
Theta Chi, Synergy, Columbae,
Jordan, Terra (Ecology House), and
one eating club, the Breakers, are
co-ops. They are much cheaper — up
to $100 less — than the food service.
Many are at least semi-vegetarian. At
Synergy there is always supposed to be
one vegetarian dish, but often, instead
of preparing two menus, the whole
meal is vegetarian. It is one of the few
places on campus where chopsticks are
offered as an alternative to silverware.
Many co-ops bake their own bread
and granola every night. That usually
means fresh bread for breakfast, butt
people in Terra usually gather in the
kitchen at night to "taste" the new
bread. If it is banana or nut bread, it
might be gone by moming. So the 50

cent Terra breakfast can either be
great or meager, depending on the
bread situation. However, granola and
yogurt are always plentiful, and there's
usually a box of organic-looking fruit.
Since co-op food is low-budget, it
consists mainly of fruit, vegetables,
cereals, and rice. Cheese and nuts are
protein sources. But a Synergy dinner
of curry and rice was not very filling,
although there was plenty of food.
Some people eagerly join co-ops, only
to discover that they miss the
meat-and-potatoes routine. But those
who like co-ops enthusiastically dream
of dishes like vegetarian pizza "with
40 kinds of vegetables all over it."
Individual Cooks
Many students choose houses,
fraternities, or eating clubs, which
have their own cooks. Menu selection
varies with the individual cooks and
the budgets they are given. A Whitman
House dinner was almost like a
co-op's: beef and vegetable stew, rice
with orange peels, green salad, and
steaming cornbread.
One lunch at El Tigre, an eating
club, brought the peculiar
combination of split pea soup, hot
dogs, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes,
and sweet rolls. Club members insisted
that this was a rare case, and ranked it
3 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Even though the row houses are
part of the food service, their cooks
have more flexibility than those in the
dorms. The intimacy of a Sunday

brunch, where the cook fixes whatever
you like, is a far cry from the morning
mob of sleepwalkers at Wilbur. Since
the small houses usually only serve 40
or so at a meal, the food tastes more
like home.
Rowdy Atmosphere
The all-male eating club, El Toro,
boasts not only a good cook, Tommy,
but also one of the rowdiest dinner
atmospheres on campus. This group
had such spirit that they feted a
member's birthday by dumping a
bucket of water on his head.
Whatever atmosphere seems most
appealing, certain statements are true
all over campus. First of all, every
house serves granola for breakfast, and
often other favorites such as grape
nuts or frosted flakes.
