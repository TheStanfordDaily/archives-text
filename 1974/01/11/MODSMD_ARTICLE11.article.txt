Misleading Statement Clarified
Editor:
In the article concering Asst. Prof.
Renato Rosaldo published in the Daily
on Dec. 6, 1973, it was stated that
Prof. Renato Rosaldo "succeeded in
wringing out a position (at Stanford)
for Michelle." Ms. Amy J.Metcalfe, in
a recent letter to the Editor, pointed
out that Prof. Michelle Rosaldo was
fully qualified and appointed
completely on her merits.
As Chairman of the Anthropology
Department I wish to confirm this and
to affirm that the statement, as
reported in the Daily story to which I
have referred, is completely
misleading. We value Prof. Michelle
Rosaldo very highly for her services to
our Department and consider that she
was fully qualified on the basis of her
own merits.

Apparently, students are currently
into "hard" mental attitudes, cold
lucidity, science and the like. Religious
thought is apt to be characterized,
under the tutelage of Monod, Skinner,
the libertarians and tutti quanti, as
"nebulous." Now, it surely can be
nebulous and in a pejorative sense (as
well as the poetic sense of Richard
Wilbur's "cloudy cloudy is the stuff of
stones"); but there is a problem of
levels here. Traditionally, these
arguments have been made on a much
higher plane.
For example, in the crusty and
familiar "bull-session" utterances of a
William Evers (Daily, Jan. 9) one looks
in vain for even a hint of the range of
anxieties, subtleties and perceptions,

the style and the class one associates
with eminently human minds from
Dante, through Shakespeare, Pascal,
Dostoevsky, Proust, Einstein, Jung and
Camus on this subject of the world's
prime mysteries. Or even with the
schoolboy debates of a few decades
ago as one glimpses them in the
writings of Joyce.
It seems that we are in for a period
of increasingly dreary mediocrity in
the universities.

Misrepresentation of Ilongots
Editor:
I regret that the portrait of me in
the Daily (Dec. 6, 1973) was

blemished by certain misunderstanding
of what I meant to say. Sexism aside,
let me clarify the single item I most
regret.
Ilongots, the people we lived among
for nearly two years in the Philippines,
enjoy a fulfilling way of life — one
worth living and studying. To
stereotype the people as
"headhunters" and call a close friend
among them "illiterate, but eloquent"
is both unethical and a
misrepresentation of anything Ilongot.
In the future I hope to speak more
clearly.

under the tutelage of Monod, Skinner,
the libertarians and tutti quanti, as
"nebulous." Now, it surely can be
nebulous and in a pejorative sense (as
well as the poetic sense of Richard
Wilbur's "cloudy cloudy is the stuff of
stones"); but there is a problem of
levels here. Traditionally, these
arguments have been made on a much
higher plane.
For example, in the crusty and
familiar "bull-session" utterances of a
William Evers (Daily, Jan. 9) one looks
in vain for even a hint of the range of
anxieties, subtleties and perceptions,

the style and the class one associates
with eminently human minds from
Dante, through Shakespeare, Pascal,
Dostoevsky, Proust, Einstein, Jung and
Camus on this subject of the world's
prime mysteries. Or even with the
schoolboy debates of a few decades
ago as one glimpses them in the
writings of Joyce.
It seems that we are in for a period
of increasingly dreary mediocrity in
the universities.

Misrepresentation of Ilongots
Editor:
I regret that the portrait of me in
the Daily (Dec. 6, 1973) was

blemished by certain misunderstanding
of what I meant to say. Sexism aside,
let me clarify the single item I most
regret.
Ilongots, the people we lived among
for nearly two years in the Philippines,
enjoy a fulfilling way of life — one
worth living and studying. To
stereotype the people as
"headhunters" and call a close friend
among them "illiterate, but eloquent"
is both unethical and a
misrepresentation of anything Ilongot.
In the future I hope to speak more
clearly.

Misleading Statement Clarified
Editor:
In the article concering Asst. Prof.
Renato Rosaldo published in the Daily
on Dec. 6, 1973, it was stated that
Prof. Renato Rosaldo "succeeded in
wringing out a position (at Stanford)
for Michelle." Ms. Amy J.Metcalfe, in
a recent letter to the Editor, pointed
out that Prof. Michelle Rosaldo was
fully qualified and appointed
completely on her merits.
As Chairman of the Anthropology
Department I wish to confirm this and
to affirm that the statement, as
reported in the Daily story to which I
have referred, is completely
misleading. We value Prof. Michelle
Rosaldo very highly for her services to
our Department and consider that she
was fully qualified on the basis of her
own merits.

Apparently, students are currently
into "hard" mental attitudes, cold
lucidity, science and the like. Religious
thought is apt to be characterized,
under the tutelage of Monod, Skinner,
the libertarians and tutti quanti, as
"nebulous." Now, it surely can be
nebulous and in a pejorative sense (as
well as the poetic sense of Richard
Wilbur's "cloudy cloudy is the stuff of
