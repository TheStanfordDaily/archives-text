# Women's Studies Increase, Student Enrollment Surges
## 
### WENDY QUINONES 
If sheer numbers are any
indication, interest in women's
studies is booming this quarter,
with more courses about women
being given than ever before,
ranging from fiction to business to
self-defense. Turnout has also
been good: several of the courses
have enrollments much larger than
anticipated.
The people — students,
professors, men and women —
who teach these courses do so for
different reasons and in different
ways. The Daily asked the
instructors to describe their
courses so that interested students
can be better informed.
Women in Labor Force
"Women in the Labor Force"
(Business 330) will be
interdisciplinary examination of
the psychological and economic
aspects of women's roles in the
labor force, according to Myra
Strober, an economist at the
Business School. FrancineGordon,
a psychologist also at the Business
School, will be teaching with her.
Emphasizing that
undergraduates are welcome,
Strober says the topic will be
approached form an intellectual,
not a personal point of view.
"We'll be looking at both
psychological and economic
aspects of the questions we ask,"
she says. "Why do women work?
Why do they hold the jobs they
do? What is their situation now,
what are the ways of changing it,
and is change desirable?"
Feminine Mystique
In "The Feminine Mystique in
American Fiction" (English 265),
Wendy Martin wants to do more
than explore the images of women
in fiction from an academic
standpoint. "I want to develop a
critical awareness in people that
the biases in American fiction are
definitely sexist," she says.
While her emphasis will be on
the aesthetics of the novel, Martin
stresses the importance of
showing that male stereotypes of
women in fiction don't mesh with
women's views of themselves.
"Undergraduate women especially
may identify deeply with the
women in fiction," Martin, says.
"But these are defeated women,
who are idealized and
romanticized. I'd like to break
that pattern."
Virginia Woolf
"You just can't read Virginia
Woolf without raising the
question of feminine

consciousness," contends Lucio
Ruotolo, whose course in Woolf's
works (English 288B) will develop
from the book he is writing.
Ruotolo credits the "fresh
insights" of the women's
movement for a new and better
understanding of Woolf's literary
intentions.
"Virginia Woolf has been
misinterpreted in the past," he
says, "largely because of critics'
inability to see what the political
problems are for women
attempting to create their identity
in a world dominated by men. In
this course we will be trying to
discover what feminine
consciousness means through
reading Virginia Woolf."
Women and History
While "Women in European
History from 1550-1850"
(History 137) may seem only
distantly relevant to the woman
of today, Carolyn Lougee is
convinced that her course can be
extremely important in a woman's
— or a man's — college experience.
By focussing on the historical
factors "which determine the
contours of life for the great mass
of women, and how they vary
from class to class and time to
time," rather than on exceptional
women, Lougee tries to give her
students a new perspective to
bring to their own lives.
"The perspective of time," she
says, "can show that the existing
situation is not he only one there
has been or can be, and that the
women's liberation movement is
not the first proposal for
fundamental changes in women's
roles."
Sex Roles
"The Psychology of Sex
Roles" (Psychology 130), says
Sandra Bern, "is a course that
shifts everyone's politics even
though politics is never really
discussed."
Although the course deals
largely with facts about the
differences between men and
women, whether these differences
are biological or caused by
socialization, this emphasis on
hard data does not detract from
the course as a personal
experience as well as an academic
one.
"I try to legitimize the idea,"
Bern says, "that although we're
talking about scientific data, this
course is still going to have a
personal impact. Students begin
to ask the question: How has my
being bom and raised as a man or

a woman impacted my life?"
In a tribute to the success of
"Self Defense for Women"
(Physical Education 8) over the
last two years, Don Blankenhorn
is dedicating his textbook,
developed from these courses, to
the women who took them. "It's
really their book, not mine," he
explains.
While karate, judo and jujitsu
will be the "core arts" for this
quarter, other precautionary and
preventive procedures will be
stressed in an effort to acheive the
course's goal — protection from
assault. "The women I've trained
at Stanford can give a good
battle," Blankenhorn says. "They
can handle themselves."
Workshop on Women
The Swopsi "Workshop on
Women" (SWOP 174B) includes
both parts of a two-quarter
sequence, an introductory course
and a more advanced one for
those who have already completed
the first. Both workshops seek to
acquaint men and women "with
the ideas and literature of the
women's liberation movement,"
says Cary Ridder, a co-leader.
Readings in both courses
include works of Germaine Greer,
Betty Friedan, Phyllis Chesler,
and others; students also
undertake related projects. Ridder
emphasizes that the course is not
directed toward consciousness
raising. "We try to keep it
academic," she says. "We want to
give people a fairly straight idea of
what's going on."
Women and Law
"Women and the Law (SWOP
190) will seek to "demystify the
law," according to Ruth Wilson, a
legal worker at the Women's
Litigation Center in San Francisco
and one of the course leaders.
Featuring outside speakers,
specialists in areas such as credit
or employment discrimination,
the course will seek to trace the
relationship between social trends
and laws. Part of that process will
involve learning how to use the
law library. For class projects,
students will study specific cases
or laws and rewrite them.
"This course is organized
around the idea of change,"
Wilson says.
