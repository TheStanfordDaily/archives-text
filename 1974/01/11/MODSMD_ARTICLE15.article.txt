# Yalom Speaks At Med School
## Encounter Groups Probed 
### 
Psychiatry Prof. Irvin D.
Yalom said Wednesday that
encounter group leaders should
establish an intellectual structure
for the emotional experience of
group participants.
Lecturing to 500 people at the
Medical School, he asserted that
the focus of an encounter group is
"two-pronged. One experiences
the group, but one also reflects
upon the very experience in which
he is engaged."
Yalom criticized encounter
groups which "offer instant
intimacy" without a structure
that allows the individual to apply
his group experience to his "life
outside."
Research conducted three
years ago by Dr. Yalom showed
that encounter groups containing
the highest percentage of
"positive change" in its members
were led by people who "provided
members with some sort of
intellectual framework by which
they could judge their
experience."
Stanford Encounter Groups
Yalom gathered data for his
research by organizing at Stanford
18 encounter groups, which met
individually for a total of 30
hours during a 10-12 week period.
Stanford students received
academic credit for participating
in the groups.

Yalom and his colleagues
reviewed the students before and
after the 10-12 week period, and
again six months later.
The students who changed
positively during the experiment
were usually in an encounter
group whose leader "gave very
high support and a moderate
amount of stimulation to their
members," Yalom said.
'Changed Them'
At the conclusion of the
encounter group series, 75 percent
of the participants felt the group
had "changed them." Yalom
added, however, that the
percentage decreased to just over
50 percent six months later.
The leaders felt that 90 percent
of the group members had
undergone significant positive
change.
They discovered that
of the 210 original participants,

approximately one-third had
undergone a positive change either
at the end of the 10-12 weeks of
encounter groups, or six months
later. "About two-thirds found
the group to be in essence an
unrewarding experience," Yalom
said.
According to Dr. Yalom, "The
groups were powerful in that
people were moved by them, in
that strong emotions were evoked,
but they were not powerful as
active agents in changing
individuals."
Yalom discounted the
commonly-held belief that
learning experience in an
encounter group "washes out
quickly." He emphasized that
"those people who ended up with
significant amounts of learning to
a very high degree maintained it
for the six month period of the
study."

"positive change" in its members
were led by people who "provided
members with some sort of
intellectual framework by which
they could judge their
experience."
Stanford Encounter Groups
Yalom gathered data for his
research by organizing at Stanford
18 encounter groups, which met
individually for a total of 30
hours during a 10-12 week period.
Stanford students received
academic credit for participating
in the groups.

Yalom and his colleagues
reviewed the students before and
after the 10-12 week period, and
again six months later.
The students who changed
positively during the experiment
were usually in an encounter
group whose leader "gave very
high support and a moderate
amount of stimulation to their
members," Yalom said.
'Changed Them'
At the conclusion of the
encounter group series, 75 percent
of the participants felt the group
had "changed them." Yalom
added, however, that the
percentage decreased to just over
50 percent six months later.
The leaders felt that 90 percent
of the group members had
undergone significant positive
change.
They discovered that
of the 210 original participants,

approximately one-third had
undergone a positive change either
at the end of the 10-12 weeks of
encounter groups, or six months
later. "About two-thirds found
the group to be in essence an
unrewarding experience," Yalom
said.
According to Dr. Yalom, "The
groups were powerful in that
people were moved by them, in
that strong emotions were evoked,
but they were not powerful as
active agents in changing
individuals."
Yalom discounted the
commonly-held belief that
learning experience in an
encounter group "washes out
quickly." He emphasized that
"those people who ended up with
significant amounts of learning to
a very high degree maintained it
for the six month period of the
study."
Psychiatry Prof. Irvin D.
Yalom said Wednesday that
encounter group leaders should
establish an intellectual structure
for the emotional experience of
group participants.
Lecturing to 500 people at the
Medical School, he asserted that
the focus of an encounter group is
"two-pronged. One experiences
the group, but one also reflects
upon the very experience in which
he is engaged."
Yalom criticized encounter
groups which "offer instant
intimacy" without a structure
that allows the individual to apply
his group experience to his "life
outside."
Research conducted three
years ago by Dr. Yalom showed
that encounter groups containing
the highest percentage of
"positive change" in its members
were led by people who "provided
members with some sort of
intellectual framework by which
they could judge their
experience."
