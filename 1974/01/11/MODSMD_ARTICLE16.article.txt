# Small Crowd Hears R & R Revival
## 
### DAN FORTE 
REDWOOD CITY-To bring in
the New Year, the Fox Theater
presented a Rock 'n' Roll Revival
consisting of ten acts from the
past, like The Coasters, Big Joe
Turner, Bobby Day and The
Olympics, all backed by the Bay
Area's own Daily Bread.
Although the first two of the
seven shows in three days brought
fairly sizeable crowds, the
Monday afternoon show drew an
audience of less than 20 people.
Before the show, emcee P
Holden asked the audience if
would agree to exchanging their
tickets for passes to that evening's
performance, so as not to waste
their expensive budget.
But a few people had prior
commitments, so the show went
on, in front of 16 or so
enthusiastic fans.
Holden kicked things off with
a couple of Otis Redding
numbers, "Satisfaction" and
"Dock Of The Bay," whcih went
over well with the Peninsula
audience.
Jessie Hill was next with the
afternoon's only uninspired
performance, singing muddy
versions of "Knock On Wood,"
"By The Light Of The Silvery
Moon," and his one and only hit
"Ooh Poo Pah Doo."
Single-Hit Acts
Several of the performers were
appearing on the reputation of
only one hit record; which was
now maybe 15 or more years old.
Consequently, these artists were
forced to fill out their act with
slightly more up-to-date tunes
made famous by other singers.
The rock 'n' roll dinosaurs kept
coming, one after the other, with
Holden jumping out in between

for some informal jiving with the
members of the audience, who
were practically all in the front
row of the huge theater.
The Real Originators
Most historians give credit to
Bill Haley and the Comets as the
first rock 'n' roll group, the
inventors. But, long before Bill
Haley ever recorded a single
record, the afternoon's next artist,
and groups like the Orioles, the
Dominos, the Midnighters, and
Fats Domino were scoring huge
hits on the black "rhythm and
mi's" stations throughout the
country.
One of the true originators was
.Jot* Turner, who has bridge the
gap between jazz, blues, and rock
'n' roll.
With a cane in one i.'.nd,
Turner sang his classic "Shake,
Rattle, and Roll," which was later
recorded by Bill Haley, Elvis, and
many others.
Bobby Day unfortunately
started with two "contemporary"
tunes, and neglected to sing his
oldies "Over and Over" and
"Little Ditty Pretty One." But,
his powerful rendition of his rock
'n' roll classic "Rockin' Robin"
was perhaps the best number of
the show.
Day then brought out his
partner to recreate the slow ballad
"Gee Whiz" which he recorded as
Bob and Earl.
Of all the performers, Day
established the best rapport with
the audience, who clapped and
sang along inaudibly to every
song, trying hard to sound like a
full house.
Day closed, paying tribute to
the late Ritchie Valens, with a
great version of "La Bamba."
The lead singer of the Coasters,

Cornell Gunther, was absent due
to illness, so Ron Holden rounded
out the trio. The switch was
hardly noticeable. In fact, it was
almost a blessing, since of late
Gunther has resorted to a sort of
super-fag imitation of Little
Richard.
The Coasters sang four of their
many hits, "Poison Ivy," "Along
Came Jones," "Charley Brown,"
and "Yakety Yak."
The hit song of the next group,
Shirley and Lee, was the title song
of the recent movie "Let The
Good Times Roll," and has been
recorded by several artists,
including Nilsson.
To close the show as one of the
best groups to come out of the
L.A. area during the 50s, the
Olympics
"ting v/sth "Big Boy Pete," a
hit which was later turned into
"The Jolly Green Giant" by the
Kinsmen, the four Olympics

was later a much bigger hit for the
Young Rascals.
As a special added treat, Ron
Holden closed the show singing
his beautiful "Love You So,"
dedicated especially to the 16 or
so fans who had shown up.

A personal note of thanks is
due to Holden and all of the
oldies stars, who put on a 100
percent show under unusually
adverse conditions when they
could have just as easily refunded
everyone's money automatically.
