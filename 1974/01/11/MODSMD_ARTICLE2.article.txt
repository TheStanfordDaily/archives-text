# Nixon Sees Damage To World Prosperity
## 
### Associated Press 
President Richard Nixon said the
energy crisis could bring about "severe
and irreparable damage" to the world's
prosperity.
Nixon made these comments in
letters sent to the governments of
oil-consuming nations invited to a
Washington conference next month on
the energy-crisis.
Nixon said the fuel shortage has
produced "an historic crossroad" in
which nations "face a fundamental
choice that can profoundly affect the
structure of international political and
economic relations for the remainder
of the century."
Energy Balance
Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger said in Washington that the
meeting would be the first in a
conference series aimed at stabilizing
the world's energy balance and
economy.
Kissinger said at a news conference
that the Nixon administration was
launching a diplomatic effort of
unprecedented scope to deal with a
global problem of unprecedented size:
an energy crisis far more serious than,
and basically independent of, the
present Arab oil embargo.
Kissinger said this effort seeks
international agreements or
understandings on the sharing of
energy technology among nations;
efforts to determine demand for
energy; and measures for conserving
energy.
Meanwhile, also in Washington, a

Federal Energy Office official said
yesterday that the curtailment in
gasoline production may be much less
than expected because the petroleum
shortage is not as great as was feared.
William A. Johnson, director of
policy analysis for the energy office,
said it may be necessary to only
reduce production by about 15
percent instead of 30 percent, which
was the original estimate.
He also said that "evidence suggests
we will be able to avoid rationing in
the country."
"People have to give up the illusion,
the self-deception that is permeating
the country, that the energy crisis is a
hoax, plotted by major oil companies
to drive up prices or put independent
companies out of business," he said.
Real Crisis
He said the crisis is real and that the
oil industry is essential in helping to
solve it.
In San Francisco U.S. Sen. John V.
Tunney, D.-Calif., yesterday voiced
suspicions that the fuel oil shortage is
not genuine and called for an
independent federal agency to check
on supply and demand.
"The question is whether there is a
fuel shortage," the California
Democrat declared.
tilack Market
He said that in Los Angeles he had
been told middle oil distillates are
available on the black market. He said
this made him suspect that there is no
shortage.
