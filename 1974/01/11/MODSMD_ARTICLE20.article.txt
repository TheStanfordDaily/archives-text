Holiday season viewers
received outstanding gifts from
two networks in the form of
documentaries: ABC's "Green
Grows the Profits" and NBC's
"The College Money Crunch."
Both shows were thought
provoking, and both were, in their
own ways, a little frightening.
"Green Grow the Profits"

independent farmer has him
raising his chickens and then
selling them to the food
companies to be slaughtered —
but in fact, that's not how it
works. "Green Grow the Profits"
charted the steady encroachment
of the large food corporations to
the point where they now control
virtually every phase of the
system renting the chicks to the

normally included in the feed as a
growth stimulant, although
federal law stipulates that arsenic
cannot be contained in the birds'
final feed before they are
slaughtered, for fear that residues
could prove harmful to humans.
The ABC News team, with
permission of the chicken
growers, obtained and analyzed
five samples of company-provided
final feed. The results: four of the
five samples contained illegal
amounts of arsenic.
The ABC team also interviewed
federal health inspectors who told
how they were threatened and
coerced by company workers into
passing possibly substandard
birds, and interviewed Secretary
of Agriculture Earl Butz on the
problems of the inspectors. All
told, the program was one of
those rarest of TV news species:
investigative reporting. We hope
for more from the ABC News
Close-Up series.
The NBC Reports program on
"The College Money Crunch" was
less spectacular, but was
nonetheless a solidly-produced
examination of the plight of many

private colleges and their
middle-class students. Reporter
Edwin Newman and crew traced
the cash shortage through
declining enrollments, federal aid
cutbacks and other sources, and
interviewed students, parents,
federal officials and college
administrators — including
Stanford Financial Aids Director
Robert Huff.
As with the ABC program,
"The College Money Crunch" did
not hesitate to criticize when
appropriate — in this case, chiefly
Congress, which removed large
segments of the middle class from
eligibility for federal aid. While
the NBC show was less
hard-hitting than "Green Grows
the Profits," this was probably
because the topic itself was less
sensational — but it was just as
significant.
Both shows held forth the
promise of more such
documentaries, and we look
forward to them. Along with the
new season of CBS's video
newsmagazine 60 Minutes, it
looks to be a very happy new year
for public affairs-minded viewers.

investigative reporting. We hope
for more from the ABC News
Close-Up series.
The NBC Reports program on
"The College Money Crunch" was
less spectacular, but was
nonetheless a solidly-produced
examination of the plight of many

private colleges and their
middle-class students. Reporter
Edwin Newman and crew traced
the cash shortage through
declining enrollments, federal aid
cutbacks and other sources, and
interviewed students, parents,
federal officials and college
administrators — including
Stanford Financial Aids Director
Robert Huff.
As with the ABC program,
"The College Money Crunch" did
not hesitate to criticize when
appropriate — in this case, chiefly
Congress, which removed large
segments of the middle class from
eligibility for federal aid. While
the NBC show was less
hard-hitting than "Green Grows
the Profits," this was probably
because the topic itself was less
sensational — but it was just as
significant.
Both shows held forth the
promise of more such
documentaries, and we look
forward to them. Along with the
new season of CBS's video
newsmagazine 60 Minutes, it
looks to be a very happy new year
for public affairs-minded viewers.
Holiday season viewers
received outstanding gifts from
two networks in the form of
documentaries: ABC's "Green
Grows the Profits" and NBC's
"The College Money Crunch."
Both shows were thought
provoking, and both were, in their
own ways, a little frightening.
"Green Grow the Profits"

independent farmer has him
raising his chickens and then
selling them to the food
companies to be slaughtered —
but in fact, that's not how it
works. "Green Grow the Profits"
charted the steady encroachment
of the large food corporations to
the point where they now control
virtually every phase of the
system renting the chicks to the

normally included in the feed as a
growth stimulant, although
federal law stipulates that arsenic
cannot be contained in the birds'
final feed before they are
slaughtered, for fear that residues
could prove harmful to humans.
The ABC News team, with
permission of the chicken
growers, obtained and analyzed
five samples of company-provided
final feed. The results: four of the
five samples contained illegal
amounts of arsenic.
The ABC team also interviewed
federal health inspectors who told
how they were threatened and
coerced by company workers into
passing possibly substandard
birds, and interviewed Secretary
of Agriculture Earl Butz on the
problems of the inspectors. All
told, the program was one of
those rarest of TV news species:
investigative reporting. We hope
for more from the ABC News
Close-Up series.
