# New Santana Disappoints Old Fans; Schon Sparkles In Journey's Debut
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO—Once upon
a time guitarist Carlos Santana
had long hair, wore jeans, knew
nothing about religion and knew
everything about playing the
guitar. Like 1973, those days are
gone forever.
Immediately following the
midnight celebratory insanity at
Winterland on New Year's Eve,
Santana stepped up to the
microphone and asked for a
moment of silence from the
audience. Shorn and dressed in
white, the disciple of Sri Chinmoy
stood oblivious to catcalls from
the crowd.
The first tune was ominous of
what was to follow, with Carlos
dancing across the stage playing a
brass gong and looking like
something out of Dr. John the
Night Tripper' strange tribe.
Despite the efforts of Santana
regulars Mike Shrieve and Jose
Chepito Areas, the tight sound
which started the Latin rock
movement is dead. Versions of old
Santana hits such as "Black Magic
Woman," "Oye Como Va," and
"Incident at Neshabur," sparked
the crowd for a few measures.
Unfortunately, Santana extended
these songs in order to include
long solos which either left the
percussion section behind or sent
waves of screeching noise through
the hall.
New Members Muddy Sound
The general sound was muddy
despite the fine individual efforts
of Areas and Shrieve. Areas held
the group together with his
precise timbale and conga work.
Shrieve played a ten minute drum
solo equal to his performance at
Woodstock. Yet two new
percussionists and two keyboard
men confuse even the most simple
passages. By contrast, the old
seven-member Santana produced a
clean sound that was unequaled.
After their two hour set,
Santana was called back for an
encore which began with "Samba
Pa Ti," and evolved into the
pounding drums and throbbing
bass of "Soul Sacrifice," the
traditional Santana closing
number.
For those who loved the old
Santana, this was both a blessing
and a curse. Although the familiar
tunes were more pleasing than the
transcendental noise of the
present, the old songs were also
painful reminders of how much
the group had changed. New
personnel cannot recreate the
primitive perfection that was
Santana.
Journey's Bright Premiere
If the end of the evening was a
disappointment for Santana fans,
the beginning of the evening
promised good things for the new
year. Neal Schon, former second
lead guitarist behind Carlos
Santana, and keyboard genius
Gregg Rolle have formed a new
group called Journey. Journey
could be described as a blend of
the old Santana sound — minus
the congas — with the sound of

the Who. That may seem to be a
doubtful comparison, but Schon's
guitar work is inconceivable.
Listening to Schon, one
imagines hearing Carlos Santana,
Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend,
8.8. King — but it's all a
19-year-old wonder who first
jammed with Santana at the
tender age of 16. Representing the
antithesis of Santana's reverent
introspection, Schon plays
straight to the audience, smiling at
Rolle and obviously enjoying the
group's first gig.
Rolle once composed many of
Santana's songs, but his style has
widened to include a distinctly
British sound full of broad, open
chords, Rolle's vocals are
powerful, retaining some of the
hypnotism of "Black Magic
Woman."
Tight, Professional
Journey possesses what is
missing in the new Santana — an
incredibly tight sound. Each song
is perfect: just long enough to
make a complete musical
statement, long enough to let
Schon's guitar shine through, but
never too long to be efficient.
Journey possesses a degree of
professionalism seldom seen in a
warm-up group. They won't be in
the warm-up spot at Winterland
for long.
The other bright spot on the
program was Herbie Hancock's
tight jazz group, the Headhunters.
Beginning with a new album cut,
"Sly," the Headhunters stayed
together from beginning to finish.
Hancock himself was excellent on
keyboards, and the group's
drummer played fast and accurate
with no let-up. The group's sound
was far more mellow than any of
the other sounds on the bill, and
they therefore provided eardrum
relief between Malo and Santana.
Malo, appearing second on the
bill, had the unfortunate handicap
of following Journey. They
probably would have sounded
great without such a tough act to
follow, and it was a sign of poor
planning that Malo wasn't the first
group on this bill.
Malo's brass section, the
powerhouse of the band if there is
one, sounded weak and

uncoordinated after the tight
Journey sound. Jorge Santana, the
lead guitarist, would be adequate
on any show that did not include
big brother Carlos and the more
formidable Schon.
Malo did, however, provide the

familiar dance beat of their big
AM hit, "Suavecito," and several
popular album cuts. Because they
could duplicate the sound their
fans expected, Malo was in some
ways perhaps more pleasing than
Santana.


NEXT BEST THING—If you haven't been able to see Comet
Kohoutek, you can still see 4 'Comets Observed," a small exhibition
which is clearly visible every (during museum hours) day at the
Stanford Museum. Pictured above is Honore Daumier's lithograph
depicting Parisian reactions to a 1857 comet.

NEXT BEST THING—If you haven't been able to see Comet
Kohoutek, you can still see 4 'Comets Observed," a small exhibition
which is clearly visible every (during museum hours) day at the
Stanford Museum. Pictured above is Honore Daumier's lithograph
depicting Parisian reactions to a 1857 comet.
SAN FRANCISCO—Once upon
a time guitarist Carlos Santana
had long hair, wore jeans, knew
nothing about religion and knew
everything about playing the
guitar. Like 1973, those days are
gone forever.
Immediately following the
midnight celebratory insanity at
Winterland on New Year's Eve,
Santana stepped up to the
microphone and asked for a
moment of silence from the
audience. Shorn and dressed in
white, the disciple of Sri Chinmoy
stood oblivious to catcalls from
the crowd.
The first tune was ominous of
what was to follow, with Carlos
dancing across the stage playing a
brass gong and looking like
something out of Dr. John the
Night Tripper' strange tribe.
Despite the efforts of Santana
regulars Mike Shrieve and Jose
Chepito Areas, the tight sound
which started the Latin rock
movement is dead. Versions of old
Santana hits such as "Black Magic
Woman," "Oye Como Va," and
"Incident at Neshabur," sparked
the crowd for a few measures.
Unfortunately, Santana extended
these songs in order to include
long solos which either left the
percussion section behind or sent
waves of screeching noise through
the hall.
New Members Muddy Sound
The general sound was muddy
despite the fine individual efforts
of Areas and Shrieve. Areas held
the group together with his
precise timbale and conga work.
Shrieve played a ten minute drum
solo equal to his performance at
Woodstock. Yet two new
percussionists and two keyboard
men confuse even the most simple
passages. By contrast, the old
seven-member Santana produced a
clean sound that was unequaled.
After their two hour set,
Santana was called back for an
encore which began with "Samba
Pa Ti," and evolved into the
pounding drums and throbbing
bass of "Soul Sacrifice," the
traditional Santana closing
number.
For those who loved the old
Santana, this was both a blessing
and a curse. Although the familiar
tunes were more pleasing than the
transcendental noise of the
present, the old songs were also
painful reminders of how much
the group had changed. New
personnel cannot recreate the
primitive perfection that was
Santana.
Journey's Bright Premiere
If the end of the evening was a
disappointment for Santana fans,
the beginning of the evening
promised good things for the new
year. Neal Schon, former second
lead guitarist behind Carlos
Santana, and keyboard genius
Gregg Rolle have formed a new
group called Journey. Journey
could be described as a blend of
the old Santana sound — minus
the congas — with the sound of

the Who. That may seem to be a
doubtful comparison, but Schon's
guitar work is inconceivable.
Listening to Schon, one
imagines hearing Carlos Santana,
Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend,
8.8. King — but it's all a
19-year-old wonder who first
jammed with Santana at the
tender age of 16. Representing the
antithesis of Santana's reverent
introspection, Schon plays
straight to the audience, smiling at
Rolle and obviously enjoying the
group's first gig.
Rolle once composed many of
Santana's songs, but his style has
widened to include a distinctly
British sound full of broad, open
chords, Rolle's vocals are
powerful, retaining some of the
hypnotism of "Black Magic
Woman."
Tight, Professional
Journey possesses what is
missing in the new Santana — an
incredibly tight sound. Each song
is perfect: just long enough to
make a complete musical
statement, long enough to let
Schon's guitar shine through, but
never too long to be efficient.
Journey possesses a degree of
professionalism seldom seen in a
warm-up group. They won't be in
the warm-up spot at Winterland
for long.
The other bright spot on the
program was Herbie Hancock's
tight jazz group, the Headhunters.
Beginning with a new album cut,
"Sly," the Headhunters stayed
together from beginning to finish.
Hancock himself was excellent on
keyboards, and the group's
drummer played fast and accurate
with no let-up. The group's sound
was far more mellow than any of
the other sounds on the bill, and
they therefore provided eardrum
relief between Malo and Santana.
Malo, appearing second on the
bill, had the unfortunate handicap
of following Journey. They
probably would have sounded
great without such a tough act to
follow, and it was a sign of poor
planning that Malo wasn't the first
group on this bill.
Malo's brass section, the
powerhouse of the band if there is
one, sounded weak and

uncoordinated after the tight
Journey sound. Jorge Santana, the
lead guitarist, would be adequate
on any show that did not include
big brother Carlos and the more
formidable Schon.
Malo did, however, provide the

familiar dance beat of their big
AM hit, "Suavecito," and several
popular album cuts. Because they
could duplicate the sound their
fans expected, Malo was in some
ways perhaps more pleasing than
Santana.

familiar dance beat of their big
AM hit, "Suavecito," and several
popular album cuts. Because they
could duplicate the sound their
fans expected, Malo was in some
ways perhaps more pleasing than
Santana.


NEXT BEST THING—If you haven't been able to see Comet
Kohoutek, you can still see 4 'Comets Observed," a small exhibition
which is clearly visible every (during museum hours) day at the
Stanford Museum. Pictured above is Honore Daumier's lithograph
depicting Parisian reactions to a 1857 comet.
SAN FRANCISCO—Once upon
a time guitarist Carlos Santana
had long hair, wore jeans, knew
nothing about religion and knew
everything about playing the
guitar. Like 1973, those days are
gone forever.
Immediately following the
midnight celebratory insanity at
Winterland on New Year's Eve,
Santana stepped up to the
microphone and asked for a
moment of silence from the
audience. Shorn and dressed in
white, the disciple of Sri Chinmoy
stood oblivious to catcalls from
the crowd.
The first tune was ominous of
what was to follow, with Carlos
dancing across the stage playing a
brass gong and looking like
something out of Dr. John the
Night Tripper' strange tribe.
Despite the efforts of Santana
regulars Mike Shrieve and Jose
Chepito Areas, the tight sound
which started the Latin rock
movement is dead. Versions of old
Santana hits such as "Black Magic
Woman," "Oye Como Va," and
"Incident at Neshabur," sparked
the crowd for a few measures.
Unfortunately, Santana extended
these songs in order to include
long solos which either left the
percussion section behind or sent
waves of screeching noise through
the hall.
New Members Muddy Sound
The general sound was muddy
despite the fine individual efforts
of Areas and Shrieve. Areas held
the group together with his
precise timbale and conga work.
Shrieve played a ten minute drum
solo equal to his performance at
Woodstock. Yet two new
percussionists and two keyboard
men confuse even the most simple
passages. By contrast, the old
seven-member Santana produced a
clean sound that was unequaled.
After their two hour set,
Santana was called back for an
encore which began with "Samba
Pa Ti," and evolved into the
pounding drums and throbbing
bass of "Soul Sacrifice," the
traditional Santana closing
number.
For those who loved the old
Santana, this was both a blessing
and a curse. Although the familiar
tunes were more pleasing than the
transcendental noise of the
present, the old songs were also
painful reminders of how much
the group had changed. New
personnel cannot recreate the
primitive perfection that was
Santana.
Journey's Bright Premiere
If the end of the evening was a
disappointment for Santana fans,
the beginning of the evening
promised good things for the new
year. Neal Schon, former second
lead guitarist behind Carlos
Santana, and keyboard genius
Gregg Rolle have formed a new
group called Journey. Journey
could be described as a blend of
the old Santana sound — minus
the congas — with the sound of

the Who. That may seem to be a
doubtful comparison, but Schon's
guitar work is inconceivable.
Listening to Schon, one
imagines hearing Carlos Santana,
Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend,
8.8. King — but it's all a
19-year-old wonder who first
jammed with Santana at the
tender age of 16. Representing the
antithesis of Santana's reverent
introspection, Schon plays
straight to the audience, smiling at
Rolle and obviously enjoying the
group's first gig.
Rolle once composed many of
Santana's songs, but his style has
widened to include a distinctly
British sound full of broad, open
chords, Rolle's vocals are
powerful, retaining some of the
hypnotism of "Black Magic
Woman."
Tight, Professional
Journey possesses what is
missing in the new Santana — an
incredibly tight sound. Each song
is perfect: just long enough to
make a complete musical
statement, long enough to let
Schon's guitar shine through, but
never too long to be efficient.
Journey possesses a degree of
professionalism seldom seen in a
warm-up group. They won't be in
the warm-up spot at Winterland
for long.
The other bright spot on the
program was Herbie Hancock's
tight jazz group, the Headhunters.
Beginning with a new album cut,
"Sly," the Headhunters stayed
together from beginning to finish.
Hancock himself was excellent on
keyboards, and the group's
drummer played fast and accurate
with no let-up. The group's sound
was far more mellow than any of
the other sounds on the bill, and
they therefore provided eardrum
relief between Malo and Santana.
Malo, appearing second on the
bill, had the unfortunate handicap
of following Journey. They
probably would have sounded
great without such a tough act to
follow, and it was a sign of poor
planning that Malo wasn't the first
group on this bill.
Malo's brass section, the
powerhouse of the band if there is
one, sounded weak and

uncoordinated after the tight
Journey sound. Jorge Santana, the
lead guitarist, would be adequate
on any show that did not include
big brother Carlos and the more
formidable Schon.
