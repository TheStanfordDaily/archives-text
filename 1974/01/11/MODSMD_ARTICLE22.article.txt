# Berkeley Sees Masterful 'Builder'
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
BERKELEY—PhiIip Larson of
the Stanford Drama Department
has done a fine job directing the
Berkeley Repertory Theater's
production of Ibsen's "The Master
Builder," faithfully rendering the
subtleties of Ibsen's
characterization and dialogue.
The play revolves around
Halvard Solness (Michael Leibert),
a brilliant architect who abandons
his high ideals after the death of
his twin sons. Instead of building
"church spires," he now builds
"homes for human beings."
However, when an admirer
from his past, Hilda Wangel
(Laurie Walters) arrives for a visit,
her youth and vigor persuade
Solness to risk himself once more

in the pursuit of his ideals — to, as
she says, "Build castles in the air."
Director Larson has in this
production emphasized the stark
contrasts of character which are
essential to all Ibsen's plays.
Hilda Wangel and Aline Solness
represent the two poles of
Solness' own character. Hilda
embodies his unfettered artistic
aspirations, while Aline represents
his sense of commitment and duty
to society.
Walters admirably handles her
role as Hilda. Because Hilda not
only reveals many facets to her
character, but also changes
dramatically during the course of
the play, the role is difficult.
Walters captures but never
exaggerates the vitality, curiosity,

and playfulness that characterize
Hilda.
Walters' performance suffers
only in an important scene in Act
11, which should mark the turning
point of Hilda's transformation
from a rambunctious tomboy into
a mature woman. In this scene,
Solness cruelly refuses to review
the drawings of his
draftsman-employee, and
consequently Hilda's unqualified
admiration for Solness wavers for
the first time in the play.
Walters could have intensified
the scene by maintaining a long
silence after Ragnar's exit, as did
Eleonora Duse and Eva Le
Galliene when they played the
role of Hilda.
Holly Barron evokes with
chilling accuracy Aline Solness'
guilt-ridden alienation from his
husband. In Act One, she subtly
conveys Aline's jealousy over an
imagine "relationship" between
her husband and his book-keeper
Kala by simply shifting her eyes
significantly in Kala's direction
upon entering and exiting.
Michael Leibert carefully
contrasts the reactions that Hilda
and Aline evoke in Solness. With
Aline, Solness is cast into a
guilt-ridden silence, while with
Hilda, he bursts into speech that
verges on poetry. Leibert is
particularly powerful in his scenes

with Walters; both seem to thrive
on the high-pitched romanticism
which pervades these scenes.
"The Master Builder" is the
most autobiographical of Ibsen's
plays. It is believed that Ibsen
modelled Hilda after a young
woman named Emilie Bardach
with whom Ibsen fell deeply in
love.
Solness' progression from
"building church spires" to
"Homes for human beings," and
after, with Hilda's prompting, to
"castles in the air," parallels
Ibsen's own experience of three
stages of dramatic writing.
During his first, or "church
spire" period, Ibsen wrote highly
romantic verse-drama, which
included "Peer Gynt," "Brand,"
"The Pretenders," and "Love's
Comedy."
The middle period of Ibsen's
drama concentrated on social
realism, following his
experimentation in and
abandonment of active political
involvement. These plays were far
ahead of the times: in 1879,
"Doll's House" outraged the
public with its frank support of
women's psychological and lawful
rights. His "Pillars of Society"
(1875) envisioned the traditional
symbols of authority (church,
government, etc.) as destructive
social forces, and endorsed the

revolution which he saw as
inevitable.
Ibsen's last eight plays, of
which 'The Master Builder" is
one, switch in focus from a
moralistic attack on society to a
psychological exploration which is
independent of time and space.
These plays are divorced from any
special context, and therefore
take on a mythical "castles in the
air" quality.
At the end of "The Master
Builder," Solness assumes the task
the Ibsen himself never assumed
politically: He pursues his ideals
in spite of dangerous
consequences.
In a Promethean gesture of
defiance, Solness climbs to the
top of a near-by steeple. His
subsequent fall and death,
however, are not as important to
Ibsen as his courage and
conviction. It is these qualities
which cause Hilda to exclaim, "I
heard harps in the air! My, my
master builder!"
