# Rock Music Can Be Fun
## Loggins & Messina Show Real Enthusiasm 
### TERRY ANZUR 
BERKELEY—The popular
music scene of the 70s is in many
ways similar to the nostalgia a
young adult sometimes feels for
the simpler days of childhood.
The traces of a Woodstock
generation still frequent rock
concerts, but the spirit of the 60s
has become a cliche. The
mushrooming popularity of rock
'n roll revivals and films that ask,
"Where were you in '62?" reflect
a desire to return to the days
when rock music was a revolution
and not a rip-off.
In their Dec. 15 performances
at the Berkeley Community
Theater, Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina proved that a rock
concert can be more than a
commercial truism; in the hands
of real artists, it becomes an
expression of art.
Typical But Effective Show
Anyone who has listened to
Loggins and Messina's albums
more than once could probably
write a review of one of their
concerts without attending it.
Loggins appears on stage first,
singing an abbreviated version of
"Danny's Song." Messina then
joins him for "The House at Pooh
Corner." Then the band rolls in.
The rest of the concert could be
recorded and packaged as
"Loggins and Messina's Greatest
Hits."
The formula is predictable, but

not trite. Although they've
probably played the same concert
more times than this reviewer has
played their first album, the
material always retains its artistic
freshness. Their performance is
stamped with a refreshing
individuality as unmistakable as a
fingerprint.
Loggins and Messina capitalize
on the sincerity of their music
with an enthusiasm that is best
expressed by Loggins luminous
smile.
They also inject spontaneity
into their standard concert
formula. Lester Garth's violin solo
generated such an estatic audience
reaction that Messina asked the
listeners if they wanted to hear
more. They did, and Messina
coaxed several minutes of
delightful improvisation out of
Garth.
Loggins and Messina play all
the hits, but not as carbon copies
of the album versins. "Vahevalla,"
was enlivened by a long jam. It
foreshadowed many selections
from their latest LP Full Sail and
a marked trend toward Jamaican
"reggae" in Loggins and Messina's
music.

Loggins, Messina, and band left
the stage early so that they'd have
enough time to be called back for
an encore before the second show.
Their return included both old
and new material — "Nobody But
You" from Sittin' In and "My
Music" from Full Sail. Many
"funky" performers have made
audience participation into a
standing joke among cynical
concert-goers. But when Loggins
and Messina asked for help on
"My Music," the audience
cooperated unselfconsciously.
Choreographed and predictable
as it may be, it is difficult to find
many faults in Loggins and
Messina's polished performance
because of the enthusiasm that
underscores it. The most
disappointing aspect of the
concert was that most of the
audience would have liked to
listen to them play for at least

twice as long as they did.
Billy Joel and his band warmed
up the audience for Loggins and
Messina. Joel is a relatively
unknown singer-pianist-composer
who doesn't deserve to remain
obscure for long.
Unfortunatey, he began his set
by singing the "technical
difficulty blues." But the
incompetence of the equipment
gorillas was the only slur on his
performance.
Joel's easy, unpretentious
manner is ideally suited to an
auditorium the size of the
Community Theater. He joked
about his recent appearances as a
warmup act for the Beach Boys'
nationwide tour where he felt
"like a dot in a huge stadium
where everyone is wondering who
Billv Joel is."
Most of the Berkeley audience
was probably asking the same

question. But by the end of the
set, Joel's identity had been
established. He writes and
performs his music with a Carol
King-like knack for touching on
aspects of everyday life that
anyone can identify with.
One tune warned that people
pay for their "live for today"
attitude "Somewhere Along the
Line." Another was deidcated to
"the bitch that everybody meets
sooner or later" and title
"Everybody Loves You Now."
The sincerity that marks Joel's
and Loggins and Messina's stage
presences is a signpost for the
direction that popular music must
take to avoid the pitfalls of
commercial exploitation. After
more than a decade on the scene
the cliches must become artistic
traditions. The enthusiasm of
these few performers may be one
effective means to that end.

The sincerity that marks Joel's
and Loggins and Messina's stage
presences is a signpost for the
direction that popular music must
take to avoid the pitfalls of
commercial exploitation. After
more than a decade on the scene
the cliches must become artistic
traditions. The enthusiasm of
these few performers may be one
effective means to that end.
BERKELEY—The popular
music scene of the 70s is in many
ways similar to the nostalgia a
young adult sometimes feels for
the simpler days of childhood.
The traces of a Woodstock
generation still frequent rock
concerts, but the spirit of the 60s
has become a cliche. The
mushrooming popularity of rock
'n roll revivals and films that ask,
"Where were you in '62?" reflect
a desire to return to the days
when rock music was a revolution
and not a rip-off.
In their Dec. 15 performances
at the Berkeley Community
Theater, Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina proved that a rock
concert can be more than a
commercial truism; in the hands
of real artists, it becomes an
expression of art.
Typical But Effective Show
Anyone who has listened to
Loggins and Messina's albums
more than once could probably
write a review of one of their
concerts without attending it.
Loggins appears on stage first,
singing an abbreviated version of
"Danny's Song." Messina then
joins him for "The House at Pooh
Corner." Then the band rolls in.
The rest of the concert could be
recorded and packaged as
"Loggins and Messina's Greatest
Hits."
The formula is predictable, but

not trite. Although they've
probably played the same concert
more times than this reviewer has
played their first album, the
material always retains its artistic
freshness. Their performance is
stamped with a refreshing
individuality as unmistakable as a
fingerprint.
Loggins and Messina capitalize
on the sincerity of their music
with an enthusiasm that is best
expressed by Loggins luminous
smile.
They also inject spontaneity
into their standard concert
formula. Lester Garth's violin solo
generated such an estatic audience
reaction that Messina asked the
listeners if they wanted to hear
more. They did, and Messina
coaxed several minutes of
delightful improvisation out of
Garth.
Loggins and Messina play all
the hits, but not as carbon copies
of the album versins. "Vahevalla,"
was enlivened by a long jam. It
foreshadowed many selections
from their latest LP Full Sail and
a marked trend toward Jamaican
"reggae" in Loggins and Messina's
music.

Loggins, Messina, and band left
the stage early so that they'd have
enough time to be called back for
an encore before the second show.
Their return included both old
and new material — "Nobody But
You" from Sittin' In and "My
Music" from Full Sail. Many
"funky" performers have made
audience participation into a
standing joke among cynical
concert-goers. But when Loggins
and Messina asked for help on
"My Music," the audience
cooperated unselfconsciously.
Choreographed and predictable
as it may be, it is difficult to find
many faults in Loggins and
Messina's polished performance
because of the enthusiasm that
underscores it. The most
disappointing aspect of the
concert was that most of the
audience would have liked to
listen to them play for at least

twice as long as they did.
Billy Joel and his band warmed
up the audience for Loggins and
Messina. Joel is a relatively
unknown singer-pianist-composer
who doesn't deserve to remain
obscure for long.
Unfortunatey, he began his set
by singing the "technical
difficulty blues." But the
incompetence of the equipment
gorillas was the only slur on his
performance.
Joel's easy, unpretentious
manner is ideally suited to an
auditorium the size of the
Community Theater. He joked
about his recent appearances as a
warmup act for the Beach Boys'
nationwide tour where he felt
"like a dot in a huge stadium
where everyone is wondering who
Billv Joel is."
Most of the Berkeley audience
was probably asking the same

question. But by the end of the
set, Joel's identity had been
established. He writes and
performs his music with a Carol
King-like knack for touching on
aspects of everyday life that
anyone can identify with.

attitude "Somewhere Along the

aspects of everyday life that
anyone can identify with.

BERKELEY—The popular
music scene of the 70s is in many
ways similar to the nostalgia a
young adult sometimes feels for
the simpler days of childhood.
The traces of a Woodstock
generation still frequent rock
concerts, but the spirit of the 60s
has become a cliche. The
mushrooming popularity of rock
'n roll revivals and films that ask,
"Where were you in '62?" reflect
a desire to return to the days
when rock music was a revolution
and not a rip-off.
In their Dec. 15 performances
at the Berkeley Community
Theater, Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina proved that a rock
concert can be more than a
commercial truism; in the hands
of real artists, it becomes an
expression of art.
Typical But Effective Show
Anyone who has listened to
Loggins and Messina's albums
more than once could probably
write a review of one of their
concerts without attending it.
Loggins appears on stage first,
singing an abbreviated version of
"Danny's Song." Messina then
joins him for "The House at Pooh
Corner." Then the band rolls in.
The rest of the concert could be
recorded and packaged as
"Loggins and Messina's Greatest
Hits."
The formula is predictable, but

not trite. Although they've
probably played the same concert
more times than this reviewer has
played their first album, the
material always retains its artistic
freshness. Their performance is
stamped with a refreshing
individuality as unmistakable as a
fingerprint.
Loggins and Messina capitalize
on the sincerity of their music
with an enthusiasm that is best
expressed by Loggins luminous
smile.
They also inject spontaneity
into their standard concert
formula. Lester Garth's violin solo
generated such an estatic audience
reaction that Messina asked the
listeners if they wanted to hear
more. They did, and Messina
coaxed several minutes of
delightful improvisation out of
Garth.
Loggins and Messina play all
the hits, but not as carbon copies
of the album versins. "Vahevalla,"
was enlivened by a long jam. It
foreshadowed many selections
from their latest LP Full Sail and
a marked trend toward Jamaican
"reggae" in Loggins and Messina's
music.

Loggins, Messina, and band left
the stage early so that they'd have
enough time to be called back for
an encore before the second show.
Their return included both old
and new material — "Nobody But
You" from Sittin' In and "My
Music" from Full Sail. Many
"funky" performers have made
audience participation into a
standing joke among cynical
concert-goers. But when Loggins
and Messina asked for help on
"My Music," the audience
cooperated unselfconsciously.
Choreographed and predictable
as it may be, it is difficult to find
many faults in Loggins and
Messina's polished performance
because of the enthusiasm that
underscores it. The most
disappointing aspect of the
concert was that most of the
audience would have liked to
listen to them play for at least

twice as long as they did.
Billy Joel and his band warmed
up the audience for Loggins and
Messina. Joel is a relatively
unknown singer-pianist-composer
who doesn't deserve to remain
obscure for long.
Unfortunatey, he began his set
by singing the "technical
difficulty blues." But the
incompetence of the equipment
gorillas was the only slur on his
performance.
Joel's easy, unpretentious
manner is ideally suited to an
auditorium the size of the
Community Theater. He joked
about his recent appearances as a
warmup act for the Beach Boys'
nationwide tour where he felt
"like a dot in a huge stadium
where everyone is wondering who
Billv Joel is."
Most of the Berkeley audience
was probably asking the same

question. But by the end of the
set, Joel's identity had been
established. He writes and
performs his music with a Carol
King-like knack for touching on
aspects of everyday life that
anyone can identify with.
