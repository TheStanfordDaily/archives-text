# Stanford Hosts Hawaii, UCLA, Cornell
## 'Big Deal' For Cardinal Wrestlers 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
This weekend is a "big deal"
for the Stanford wrestling team
and its coach, Joe De Meo.
At least that is how
tomorrow's triangular meet
between Stanford, UCLA and
Cornell has been billed on posters
all over campus. But first, the
Cards will take on the Hawaii
grapplers tonight. Both matches
will be in Maples Pavilion at 7:30
p.m.

De Meo said that the Hawaii
team, appropriately nicknamed
the Rainbows, is "not bad." They
have "several strong weight
classes," he added.
Hawaii lost a tough match to
Cal, 29-23, earlier in the week. It's
hard to believe the Rainbows
would travel this far for nothing,
so it should be a very exciting
match.
Saturday should be a tough
match for the Cards as they take
on two highly regarded teams.
The Bruins are rated second in the
state, and De Meo calls Cornell,
his alma mater, "one of the two
or three best teams in the East."
Two Sets of Twins
The Bruins season roster
presents a rarity: two sets of
twins. The Donaldson brothers are

both NCAA place winners. Ken
was second and Kirt sixth in their
respective weight classes.
Mike and Paul Schantz are
junior college transfers with
highly respectable J.C. records.
UCLA is coached by Dave
Hollinger, who last year
"launched an extensive new
recruiting and rebuilding program
which appears to be about to pay
dividends," says the Bruin
wrestling brochure.
One of those dividends is
freshman Jerry Bishop (Hwt) who
will be matched against the Cards'
frosh stand-out Gary Anderson,
also a varsity football player.
It won't be the first time these
two heavyweights have faced each

other. Anderson defeated Bishop
for the California state high
school championship last year.
Saturday's match will probably be
the first of many chances they
will have to renew their rivalry.
'Future NCAA Champ'
De Meo said that Anderson has
been one of the most impressive
wrestlers this season, and pegs him
as a "future NCAA champ."
Mark Yancey has been another
top Card grappler this season.
"He's been terrific," were De
Meo's words about the freshman,
who turned in an exciting 21-19
come-from-behind win against San
Jose State on Tuesday.
Roy Tolles has been
"unbelievable" in De Meo's
words. Tolles won against
Humboldt State and conquered
his San Jose opponent, 11-3. De
Meo also cited Marc Frelier as
"doing well."
But for the Cards, it has been
what they haven't had that has
kept the team from achieving
greatness.
Stanford has been forced to
forfeit the 118-pound weight class
in their last two matches because
they lack a wrestler in that
division. De Meo almost feels like
putting up help wanted signs all
over the campus.
Injuries have hit the squad also.
First it was John Govea, last
year's top freshman: out for the
season. Then Chris Horpel got
hurt and will also be sidelined for
the year. Ken Krebs has been
nagged with injuries, which now
have forced him to red-shirt this
season, rather than wrestle at less
than full strength.
But De Meo is not thinking
about the injuries ... he's
thinking about the "big deal"
that's planned for the weekend.

match.
Saturday should be a tough
match for the Cards as they take
on two highly regarded teams.
The Bruins are rated second in the
state, and De Meo calls Cornell,
his alma mater, "one of the two
or three best teams in the East."
Two Sets of Twins
The Bruins season roster
presents a rarity: two sets of
twins. The Donaldson brothers are

both NCAA place winners. Ken
was second and Kirt sixth in their
respective weight classes.
Mike and Paul Schantz are
junior college transfers with
highly respectable J.C. records.
UCLA is coached by Dave
Hollinger, who last year
"launched an extensive new
recruiting and rebuilding program
which appears to be about to pay
dividends," says the Bruin
wrestling brochure.
One of those dividends is
freshman Jerry Bishop (Hwt) who
will be matched against the Cards'
frosh stand-out Gary Anderson,
also a varsity football player.
It won't be the first time these
two heavyweights have faced each

other. Anderson defeated Bishop
for the California state high
school championship last year.
Saturday's match will probably be
the first of many chances they
will have to renew their rivalry.
'Future NCAA Champ'
De Meo said that Anderson has
been one of the most impressive
wrestlers this season, and pegs him
as a "future NCAA champ."
Mark Yancey has been another
top Card grappler this season.
"He's been terrific," were De
Meo's words about the freshman,
who turned in an exciting 21-19
come-from-behind win against San
Jose State on Tuesday.
Roy Tolles has been
"unbelievable" in De Meo's
words. Tolles won against
Humboldt State and conquered
his San Jose opponent, 11-3. De
Meo also cited Marc Frelier as
"doing well."
But for the Cards, it has been
what they haven't had that has
kept the team from achieving
greatness.
Stanford has been forced to
forfeit the 118-pound weight class
in their last two matches because
they lack a wrestler in that
division. De Meo almost feels like
putting up help wanted signs all
over the campus.
Injuries have hit the squad also.
First it was John Govea, last
year's top freshman: out for the
season. Then Chris Horpel got
hurt and will also be sidelined for
the year. Ken Krebs has been
nagged with injuries, which now
have forced him to red-shirt this
season, rather than wrestle at less
than full strength.
But De Meo is not thinking
about the injuries ... he's
thinking about the "big deal"
that's planned for the weekend.

Cards will take on the Hawaii
grapplers tonight. Both matches
will be in Maples Pavilion at 7:30

De Meo said that the Hawaii
team, appropriately nicknamed
the Rainbows, is "not bad." They
have "several strong weight
classes," he added.
Hawaii lost a tough match to
Cal, 29-23, earlier in the week. It's
hard to believe the Rainbows
would travel this far for nothing,
so it should be a very exciting
match.
