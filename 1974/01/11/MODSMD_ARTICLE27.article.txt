# Swimmers Host Talented Huskies
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
Led by Olympians Rick
DeMont, Robin Backhaus and
Doug Northway, the University of
Washington Huskies come to the
Stanford Swim Stadium
tomorrow afternoon to battle
Stanford's swimmers in the first
dual meet of the '74 season.
Ranked fourth in the nation,
the powerful Huskies will be
seriously challenged by the sixth
ranked Cardinals — that is, if all
goes according to coach Jim
Gaughran's plans.
Washington has depth and
strength. The question in
Gaughran's mind is how the
Huskies will swim their big guns.
DeMont will probably swim the
1000 and the 500 but Backhaus
and Doug Northway's events have
yet to be decided.
Northway, a bronze medalist in
the 1500-meter freestyle in
Munich, has been recovering from
mononucleosis. Whether or not he
has fully recovered won't be
known until after he swims.
Backhaus, another bronze
medalist, is expected to swim the
200 fly, but his second event is
uncertain.
There will be several key events
throughout the meet, and if
Stanford is to win, the Cards will
have to take all of them. Sprint
coach Jeff Hammett cited the 50
and 100-yard freestyles as well as
the free relay as vital races.
Washington's Stan Carper will
be the man to beat in the sprints.
His best time for the year in the
100 is 46.9, compared to
Stanford's Bruce Goodwin (46.9)
and Dave Fairbank (47.0).
In the free relay, Washington

has posted a 3:10.0 to date, while
Stanford has gone but four tenths
faster at 3:09.6. Yet Hammett,
who is as wealthy in sprinters as
Bebe Rebozo is in money, is
confident that his men will come
through.
John Hencken should take the
breaststroke easily, but may find
the going tough (for a change) in
the individual medley. Hell be
going against Stan Carper, who
boasts the world's second fastest
200-meter individual medley time
for 1973.
In the diving, Wayne Wager
must contend with Washington's
Ralf Bjur, Pacific Eight champion
in both the one and three-meter
boards.
Of all the key events, the most
important will be the very first
event of the day: the 400-yard
medley relay. If Randy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Roux and Dean Anderson can
combine for a win, the
momentum just may swing
toward the Cardinals and the
points just may fall in favor of
Gaughran's plans. But as Hammett
said, "It's going to be tough."

the 1500-meter freestyle in
Munich, has been recovering from
mononucleosis. Whether or not he
has fully recovered won't be
known until after he swims.
Backhaus, another bronze
medalist, is expected to swim the
200 fly, but his second event is
uncertain.
There will be several key events
throughout the meet, and if
Stanford is to win, the Cards will
have to take all of them. Sprint
coach Jeff Hammett cited the 50
and 100-yard freestyles as well as
the free relay as vital races.
Washington's Stan Carper will
be the man to beat in the sprints.
His best time for the year in the
100 is 46.9, compared to
Stanford's Bruce Goodwin (46.9)
and Dave Fairbank (47.0).
In the free relay, Washington

has posted a 3:10.0 to date, while
Stanford has gone but four tenths
faster at 3:09.6. Yet Hammett,
who is as wealthy in sprinters as
Bebe Rebozo is in money, is
confident that his men will come
through.
John Hencken should take the
breaststroke easily, but may find
the going tough (for a change) in
the individual medley. Hell be
going against Stan Carper, who
boasts the world's second fastest
200-meter individual medley time
for 1973.
In the diving, Wayne Wager
must contend with Washington's
Ralf Bjur, Pacific Eight champion
in both the one and three-meter
boards.
Of all the key events, the most
important will be the very first
event of the day: the 400-yard
medley relay. If Randy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Roux and Dean Anderson can
combine for a win, the
momentum just may swing
toward the Cardinals and the
points just may fall in favor of
Gaughran's plans. But as Hammett
said, "It's going to be tough."
Led by Olympians Rick
DeMont, Robin Backhaus and
Doug Northway, the University of
Washington Huskies come to the
Stanford Swim Stadium
tomorrow afternoon to battle
Stanford's swimmers in the first
dual meet of the '74 season.
Ranked fourth in the nation,
the powerful Huskies will be
seriously challenged by the sixth
ranked Cardinals — that is, if all
goes according to coach Jim
Gaughran's plans.
Washington has depth and
strength. The question in
Gaughran's mind is how the
Huskies will swim their big guns.
DeMont will probably swim the
1000 and the 500 but Backhaus
and Doug Northway's events have
yet to be decided.
