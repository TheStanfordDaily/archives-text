# NCAA Relaxes Eligibility Rules
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) has
relaxed some of those
often-criticized rules which raised
the spectre of ineligibility over
any athlete who breathed near a
professional.
First, the member schools,
meeting this week in San
Francisco, voted 258-123 to allow
athletes who are professionals in
one sport to compete on, the
collegiate level in another sport.
This ruling especially affects
baseball players who turn pro out
of high school. Stanford football
coach Jack Christiansen said, "We
had cases when we were recruiting
high school kids who signed
baseball contracts," but didn't
make it to the majors. "They
might want to come back and try
college football."
Another change allows amateur
golf and tennis players to
participate in pro-am events, with
the pro allowed to take money for
the event. According to tennis

coach Dick Gould, this "keeps the
kid from getting hurt" by
professionals who say they aren't
taking money but in fact are.
"A couple years ago, there was
some suspicion when Jimmy
Connors [then of UCLA] was
playing with Pancho Gonzales
that Gonzales was taking money.
Now it's irrelevant." Contrary to
some newspaper reports, Gould
does not believe this rule allows
the amateur to take money from
the event.
A third rule change allows
athletes to try out with pro teams
without necessarily losing their
collegiate eligibility in that sport.
In other moves, the NCAA
—limited the number of
football scholarships a school
could give in any one year to 30,
while keeping the total number of
scholarships allowed at 105. This
should help Stanford, according
to Christiansen, because it will
keep a school from rebuilding by
"bringing in 40 or 50 or 60 kids
.. . UCLA signed 50-some people
last year."
| —refused to reinstate the
[ controversial 1.6 predicted grade
point average requirement, which
did little but cause confusion and
lawsuits. Instead, the schools
voted to retain the 1.0 grade level
rule for incoming high school and
junior college students.
—dropped the mid-November
date when football bowls can
contact schools. Until a new
system is adopted to replace the
old, unenforceable one, bowls can
invite schools at any time — even
now.
The NCAA coaches
recommended a ban on blocking
below the waist on kicking plays
be adopted by the Football Rules
Committee, which meets next
week. Christiansen, as well as
John McKay and Ara Parseghian,
coaches of the last two national
champions, is in favor of the rule,
designed to cut down injuries on
"cheap shots."
Another recommendation
would eliminate the "messenger"
who does nothing but carry in
plays. The change, which would
require the messenger to stay in
the game for a play, will, as one
coach put it, prevent a team from
using "a girl in hot pants" to carry
in plays.
