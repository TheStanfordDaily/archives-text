# Contract Negotiations Deadlocked
## USE, University 'Miles Apart' 
### DON COX 
University and United Stanford
Employees (USE) negotiating teams
have failed so far to reconcile any of
the numerous differences between the
union's proposed contract and the
University's counter-offer.
"We are miles apart from [the
union's] initial pay proposal," said
Doug Barton, head of the University
negotiating team.
USE called for wage increases last
November ranging from 20 to 40
percent on a one-year contract. The
University's counter proposal offered
pay hikes averaging seven percent for a
three-year pact.
The union's proposal is "far beyond
what the University can realistically be
expected to pay. Our proposal, we
feel, is truly realistic," Barton added.
In addition to the wage increases,
USE demands included a $600
minimum monthly wage, increased
jobs and vacations and a cost-of-living
escalator.
Negotiations have continued since
December, though many of the
union's demands have yet to be
discussed in the negotiating sessions
held twice a week.
Jim Berk, head of the USE
bargaining team and president of the
union, maintained that the union's

demands are reasonable. Berk added
that there is "the increased possibility
of a strike, though the union is not yet
ready to strike on specific issues. It's
too early to us to draw a line."
USE, which yesterday announced
its affiliation with San Mateo and
Santa Clara AFL-CIO Central labor
councils, is the local affiliate of the
Service Employees International
Union, AFL-CIO.

In its counter proposal, the
University has offered to write a
grievance procedure into the contract
and to reduce the total time period it
takes employees to advance to the top
of the pay range from two and a half
to one and a half years. The union had
asked for the abolition of the system
so that employees could advance to
the top of the pay range after only 90
days on the job. Berk also criticized
the proposed grievance procedure.
