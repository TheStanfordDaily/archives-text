# Menlo Trips JVs In Two Overtimes
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
The visit of Howie Dallmar Jr.
to Maples Pavilion last night was
overshadowed by an upstart
performance by the Stanford
junior varsity, which battled
Dallmar's favored Menlo College
team into double overtime before
losing, 66-58.
Dallmar's reputation as a 6-6
"bruiser" seemed deserved in a
literal sense: the son of the
veteran Cardinal cage mentor
fouled out with 14:03 left in the
game.
Scoring only six points, the
Menlo forward was hardly a key
factor in the game; a vital element
of the final result, however, was
Stanford's inability to make a
single basket through the deciding
portion of the final overtime.
"They just wouldn't fall for
us," said disappointed interim
head coach Bob Buell. "We didn't
get the breaks at the end — and
we didn't get some in the middle,
either."
Buell did say that his smaller
Cardinals were able to carry the
game to Menlo most of the way
(they led, 46-38, with 5:55 to go)
because "we can run like hell.
This is the best we've run. We
didn't get many cherry picks or
breaks, but we did get down for
five-on-fours."
Leading Card scorer was Scott
Russell with 13.
Menlo played sloppy ball for
much of the game, with its players
and coach, Bud Presley, exhibiting
extreme tension at points. Much
to the delight of amused
onlookers, Presley barked out a
"states rights" platform in the
first half: each offensive strategy
was named after one of America's
50.

Stanford worked for a last shot
that would have meant victory at
the end of both regulation play
and the first overtime, and Buell
failed to call a time-out with a few
seconds left in both cases. "We
we're movin' all right," said the
coach in his defense. "If people
started stagnating, I would have
called a time out."
The Cards failed on both final
shots, and a multitude of Stanford
fouls in the final overtime put
them out of reach of a third
clinching basket.
The JV, now 2-3, travels to
Stockton tomorrow for a 5:55
p.m. game with the University of
the Pacific JV. "We'll get 'em,"
Buell promises.

Maples. Bill Walton, the redhead in the background, isn't too bad
either.
