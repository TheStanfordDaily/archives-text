# Rugby Team Reunited After Four-Week Vacation Layoff
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Today in college athletics
vacations are usually no more
than periods where athletes
concentrate on their respective
sports. While other students enjoy
the respite from work, college
athletes are usually very busy.
Rubby, however, is an
exception. Last Monday coach
Pete Kmetovic held a four-week

reunion with his team. "Of
course they're out of shape,"
Kmetovic said, "but every rugby
team is in the same boat we're
in."
Tomorrow the Cards will test
the validity of Kmetovic's claim
when they travel to Moraga for a
1:30 p.m. game against St. Mary's.
"St. Mary's will be a good test for
us. They didn't start school until
this week, so we should be playing
in the same condition," Kmetovic
said.
St. Mary's lost to the San
Francisco Rugby Club in the
opening round of last month's
Stanford ten-a-side tournament.
The Cards looked "great" in the
tournament, according to
Kmetovic.
South of Border
In the tourney the Cards were
led by Eric Test and Craig
Zaltosky. Test hurt his wrist
earlier this week but the injury is
not expected to keep him out of
action in tomorrow's contest.
However, as of Wednesday, "Mr.
Z" had not attended practice.
He's reportedly still vacationing
south of the border.
Kmetovic is still looking for a
captain. In a player-oriented sport
such as rugby the captain plays an
important role. Stanford fields
four rugby teams and one man
can't see all the playets, so the
captain serves as a liaison between
the players and the coach. "Right
now I'm looking for someone
with a lot of experience to captain

the team," Kmetovic said.
In December there was a rumor
floating around that a good player
from the east was in Business
School. Well, that rumor, unlike
so many others in the world of
athletics, is true."Larry Lieberman
from Dartmouth has been
outstanding in the first week of
practice," said Kmetovic. Marty
Odonohue is another player who
has caught Kmetovic's eye.
Bunce, Schultz Eligible
The new NCAA rule passed
just this week also figures to help
the Cards. The rule, which states
that athletes who are professionals
in one sport may be considered
amateurs in another, makes Jack
Schultz and Don Bunce eligible to
play for the Cards. Both are fine
rugby players, and both are
currently enrolled in Stanford
graduate schools. They teamed up
with a couple of other Stanford
alumni to win the ten-a-side
tournament.
Bunce may fill in at fullback
for the Cards, a position Kmetovic
has had a hard time filling. "He
would make an ideal fullback,"
said Kmetovic, Prop Chuck
Corder has also looked good in
practice.
"We've moved the ball real well
in scrimages and right now it
looks real good," said Kmetovic.
The Cards participate in a
loosely knit league with USC,
UCLA, San Francisco Rugby
Club, Bay Area Touring Side,
California and the Ramblers.

practice.
"We've moved the ball real well
in scrimages and right now it
looks real good," said Kmetovic.
The Cards participate in a
loosely knit league with USC,
UCLA, San Francisco Rugby
Club, Bay Area Touring Side,
California and the Ramblers.
Today in college athletics
vacations are usually no more
than periods where athletes
concentrate on their respective
sports. While other students enjoy
the respite from work, college
athletes are usually very busy.
Rubby, however, is an
exception. Last Monday coach
Pete Kmetovic held a four-week

reunion with his team. "Of
course they're out of shape,"
Kmetovic said, "but every rugby
team is in the same boat we're
in."
Tomorrow the Cards will test
the validity of Kmetovic's claim
when they travel to Moraga for a
1:30 p.m. game against St. Mary's.
"St. Mary's will be a good test for
us. They didn't start school until
this week, so we should be playing
in the same condition," Kmetovic
said.
St. Mary's lost to the San
Francisco Rugby Club in the
opening round of last month's
Stanford ten-a-side tournament.
The Cards looked "great" in the
tournament, according to
Kmetovic.
South of Border
In the tourney the Cards were
led by Eric Test and Craig
Zaltosky. Test hurt his wrist
earlier this week but the injury is
not expected to keep him out of
action in tomorrow's contest.
However, as of Wednesday, "Mr.
Z" had not attended practice.
He's reportedly still vacationing
south of the border.
Kmetovic is still looking for a
captain. In a player-oriented sport
such as rugby the captain plays an
important role. Stanford fields
four rugby teams and one man
can't see all the playets, so the
captain serves as a liaison between
the players and the coach. "Right
now I'm looking for someone
with a lot of experience to captain

the team," Kmetovic said.
In December there was a rumor
floating around that a good player
from the east was in Business
School. Well, that rumor, unlike
so many others in the world of
athletics, is true."Larry Lieberman
from Dartmouth has been
outstanding in the first week of
practice," said Kmetovic. Marty
Odonohue is another player who
has caught Kmetovic's eye.
Bunce, Schultz Eligible
The new NCAA rule passed
just this week also figures to help
the Cards. The rule, which states
that athletes who are professionals
in one sport may be considered
amateurs in another, makes Jack
Schultz and Don Bunce eligible to
play for the Cards. Both are fine
rugby players, and both are
currently enrolled in Stanford
graduate schools. They teamed up
with a couple of other Stanford
alumni to win the ten-a-side
tournament.
Bunce may fill in at fullback
for the Cards, a position Kmetovic
has had a hard time filling. "He
would make an ideal fullback,"
said Kmetovic, Prop Chuck
Corder has also looked good in
practice.
"We've moved the ball real well
in scrimages and right now it
looks real good," said Kmetovic.
