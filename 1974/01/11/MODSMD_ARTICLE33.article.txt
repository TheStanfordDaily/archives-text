LOS ANGELES (AP) - UCLA
center Bill Walton, who suffered a
back injury Monday night,
probably won't play when the
Bruins put their 85-game winning
streak on the line tonight against
California, Coach John Wooden
said yesterday.
Walton "probably won't even
suit up" for Pac-8 conference
games against Cal and Stanford,
Wooden said.
Ralph Drollinger, a 7-1
sophomore, will start in Walton's
place and be backed up by 6-9
freshman Richard Washington.
Walton suffered a bruised back
muscle against Washington State
when he jumped high to take a
pass under the basket and
tumbled over a WSU player.
X-rays were negative and Walton
had been expected to play but he
was unable to practice because of
the pain, a Bruin spokesman said.

According to UCLA coach
John Wooden, "My philosophy is
that we don't try to rise to heights
occasionally because of certain
opponents, but rather we attempt
to maintain our pride through our
own play regardless of the
supposed strength of any
opponent."
The Bruins have 'maintained
their pride' for the last four and a
half seasons and 85 games with
surprising ease, and if Stanford is
to have any chance of halting that
streak at 86 tomorrow afternoon,
the Cards will have to soar to an
unbelievable new height.
But tonight at 8 p.m., 19 hours
before that moment of truth, the
Cards will challenge 17th-ranked
USC in the Sports Arena, a team
whose win streak of one is a bit
less imposing than the apparently
unending string of the irrepressible
Bruins.
The Trojans played poorly in
their upset loss to Washington
State last Saturday, guilty of a
ragged game strangely reminiscent
of Stanford's efforts last weekend.
If both teams repeat those
performances tonight, the ball
may never get past midcourt.
But SC (9-2) is capable of
playing much better. The Trojans
rebounded 48 hours after the
WSU upset to rout Washington
90-76. The hapless Huskies were
still licking their wounds after
their 100-48 mauling by the
Bruins, and the loss dropped their
record to 0-2, giving Stanford
some company in the conference
cellar.
The Trojan offense revolves
around the talented backcourt
tandem of senior Dan Anderson
(6-2) and Gus Williams (6-2),
whom Boyd describes as "the
most physically talented player
I've ever coached." Williams is the
third leading scorer in the Pac-8
with a 17.7 average, and is
connecting on better than half his
field goal attempts.
Starting Lineup
Anderson is second only to
some guy named Walton in field
goal shooting percentages at .604.
Joining Anderson and Williams in
the starting lineup tonight will
probably be John Lambert, the
teams leading rebounder with a

6.5 average, center Mike Westra
and forward Bob Trowbridge.
"Winning at home will be
extremely critical if we are to
maintain ourselves as legitimate
conference contenders," said
Boyd. "Stanford could just as well
be 2-0 as 0-2. They're capable of
beating anybody."
Capable, maybe, but so far the
Cards haven't beaten anybody at
least not in the conference. And if
they continue to play like they
did last weekend they probably
won't beat anyone, much less
USC and UCLA. The Cards upset
the Trojans a year ago, and they
desperately need another upset
tonight if they are to be
considered legitimate first division
contenders. With only 17 hours
rest after tonight's contest
Stanford will have to be prepared
to challenge the best team in the
country....
Eighty-five straight victories.
Fifty-six straight wins at Pauley
Pavilion. Thirty-six strainght
victories in NCAA competition.
Seven straight NCAA titles. Seven
straight Pac-8 titles.
'Realize We Can Lose'
"Our biggest motivation is that
we realize that we can lose every
time we step onto the court,"
explains Bruin Ail-American Keith
Wilkes. Is he putting us on? Most
basketball fans can't even
remember the last time UCLA
lost. Some probably weren't even

bom then. Was it Notre Dame?
Houston? Oregon?
Sadists will delight in knowing
that Bill Walton, who leads the
Pac-8 in field goal percentage,
rebounding, and is second in
scoring, is fully recovered from
the painful bruise he received last
Monday against WSU and will of
course start at center against Cal
tonight, and Stanford tomorrow
at 3 p.m. in the Pac-8 TV game of
the week (Channel 2).
Joining the two-time NCAA
Player of the Year in the starting
lineup will be guards Tommy
Curtis (5-11) and Pete Trgovich

(6-5), and forwards Keith Wilkes
(6-6) and Dave Meyers (6-7).
Stanford will most liekly
counter with the same lineup that
started last Saturday's game
against Oregon State — Rich
Kelley, Ed Schweitzer, Dave
Frost, Melvin Arterberry and
Mark Gilberg.
Last year at Pauley Pavilion,
the Bruins needed a second half
rally to trip the Cards, 51-45.
Stanford led 25-18 at halftime.

Cardinal Notes: Wilkes, who
scored 27 points last weekend in

the Northwest, has now joined
UCLA's elite 1000 point club, the
14th Bruin to accomplish this
feat. His career total reads 1001

the Cards will have to soar to an
unbelievable new height.
But tonight at 8 p.m., 19 hours
before that moment of truth, the
Cards will challenge 17th-ranked
USC in the Sports Arena, a team
whose win streak of one is a bit
less imposing than the apparently
unending string of the irrepressible
Bruins.
The Trojans played poorly in
their upset loss to Washington
State last Saturday, guilty of a
ragged game strangely reminiscent
of Stanford's efforts last weekend.
If both teams repeat those
performances tonight, the ball
may never get past midcourt.
But SC (9-2) is capable of
playing much better. The Trojans
rebounded 48 hours after the
WSU upset to rout Washington
90-76. The hapless Huskies were
still licking their wounds after
their 100-48 mauling by the
Bruins, and the loss dropped their
record to 0-2, giving Stanford
some company in the conference
cellar.
The Trojan offense revolves
around the talented backcourt
tandem of senior Dan Anderson
(6-2) and Gus Williams (6-2),
whom Boyd describes as "the
most physically talented player
I've ever coached." Williams is the
third leading scorer in the Pac-8
with a 17.7 average, and is
connecting on better than half his
field goal attempts.
Starting Lineup
Anderson is second only to
some guy named Walton in field
goal shooting percentages at .604.
Joining Anderson and Williams in
the starting lineup tonight will
probably be John Lambert, the
teams leading rebounder with a

6.5 average, center Mike Westra
and forward Bob Trowbridge.
"Winning at home will be
extremely critical if we are to
maintain ourselves as legitimate
conference contenders," said
Boyd. "Stanford could just as well
be 2-0 as 0-2. They're capable of
beating anybody."
Capable, maybe, but so far the
Cards haven't beaten anybody at
least not in the conference. And if
they continue to play like they
did last weekend they probably
won't beat anyone, much less
USC and UCLA. The Cards upset
the Trojans a year ago, and they
desperately need another upset
tonight if they are to be
considered legitimate first division
contenders. With only 17 hours
rest after tonight's contest
Stanford will have to be prepared
to challenge the best team in the
country....
Eighty-five straight victories.
Fifty-six straight wins at Pauley
Pavilion. Thirty-six strainght
victories in NCAA competition.
Seven straight NCAA titles. Seven
straight Pac-8 titles.
'Realize We Can Lose'
"Our biggest motivation is that
we realize that we can lose every
time we step onto the court,"
explains Bruin Ail-American Keith
Wilkes. Is he putting us on? Most
basketball fans can't even
remember the last time UCLA
lost. Some probably weren't even

bom then. Was it Notre Dame?
Houston? Oregon?
Sadists will delight in knowing
that Bill Walton, who leads the
Pac-8 in field goal percentage,
rebounding, and is second in
scoring, is fully recovered from
the painful bruise he received last
Monday against WSU and will of
course start at center against Cal
tonight, and Stanford tomorrow
at 3 p.m. in the Pac-8 TV game of
the week (Channel 2).
Joining the two-time NCAA
Player of the Year in the starting
lineup will be guards Tommy
Curtis (5-11) and Pete Trgovich

(6-5), and forwards Keith Wilkes
(6-6) and Dave Meyers (6-7).
Stanford will most liekly
counter with the same lineup that
started last Saturday's game
against Oregon State — Rich
Kelley, Ed Schweitzer, Dave
Frost, Melvin Arterberry and
Mark Gilberg.
Last year at Pauley Pavilion,
the Bruins needed a second half
rally to trip the Cards, 51-45.
Stanford led 25-18 at halftime.

Anderson is second only to
some guy named Walton in field
goal shooting percentages at .604.
Joining Anderson and Williams in
the starting lineup tonight will
probably be John Lambert, the
teams leading rebounder with a

6.5 average, center Mike Westra
and forward Bob Trowbridge.
"Winning at home will be
extremely critical if we are to
maintain ourselves as legitimate
conference contenders," said
Boyd. "Stanford could just as well
be 2-0 as 0-2. They're capable of
beating anybody."
Capable, maybe, but so far the
Cards haven't beaten anybody at
least not in the conference. And if
they continue to play like they
did last weekend they probably
won't beat anyone, much less
USC and UCLA. The Cards upset
the Trojans a year ago, and they
desperately need another upset
tonight if they are to be
considered legitimate first division
contenders. With only 17 hours
rest after tonight's contest
Stanford will have to be prepared
to challenge the best team in the
country....
Eighty-five straight victories.
Fifty-six straight wins at Pauley
Pavilion. Thirty-six strainght
victories in NCAA competition.
Seven straight NCAA titles. Seven
straight Pac-8 titles.
'Realize We Can Lose'
"Our biggest motivation is that
we realize that we can lose every
time we step onto the court,"
explains Bruin Ail-American Keith
Wilkes. Is he putting us on? Most
basketball fans can't even
remember the last time UCLA
lost. Some probably weren't even

bom then. Was it Notre Dame?
Houston? Oregon?
Sadists will delight in knowing
that Bill Walton, who leads the
Pac-8 in field goal percentage,
rebounding, and is second in
scoring, is fully recovered from
the painful bruise he received last
Monday against WSU and will of
course start at center against Cal
tonight, and Stanford tomorrow
at 3 p.m. in the Pac-8 TV game of
the week (Channel 2).
Joining the two-time NCAA
Player of the Year in the starting
lineup will be guards Tommy
Curtis (5-11) and Pete Trgovich

(6-5), and forwards Keith Wilkes
(6-6) and Dave Meyers (6-7).
Stanford will most liekly
counter with the same lineup that
started last Saturday's game
against Oregon State — Rich
Kelley, Ed Schweitzer, Dave
Frost, Melvin Arterberry and
Mark Gilberg.
Last year at Pauley Pavilion,
the Bruins needed a second half
rally to trip the Cards, 51-45.
Stanford led 25-18 at halftime.

Bulletin
LOS ANGELES (AP) - UCLA
center Bill Walton, who suffered a
back injury Monday night,
probably won't play when the
Bruins put their 85-game winning
streak on the line tonight against
California, Coach John Wooden
said yesterday.
Walton "probably won't even
suit up" for Pac-8 conference
games against Cal and Stanford,
Wooden said.
Ralph Drollinger, a 7-1
sophomore, will start in Walton's
place and be backed up by 6-9
freshman Richard Washington.
Walton suffered a bruised back
muscle against Washington State
when he jumped high to take a
pass under the basket and
tumbled over a WSU player.
X-rays were negative and Walton
had been expected to play but he
was unable to practice because of
the pain, a Bruin spokesman said.

According to UCLA coach
John Wooden, "My philosophy is
that we don't try to rise to heights
occasionally because of certain
opponents, but rather we attempt
to maintain our pride through our
own play regardless of the
supposed strength of any
opponent."
The Bruins have 'maintained
their pride' for the last four and a
half seasons and 85 games with
surprising ease, and if Stanford is
to have any chance of halting that
streak at 86 tomorrow afternoon,
the Cards will have to soar to an
unbelievable new height.
But tonight at 8 p.m., 19 hours
before that moment of truth, the
Cards will challenge 17th-ranked
USC in the Sports Arena, a team
whose win streak of one is a bit
less imposing than the apparently
unending string of the irrepressible
Bruins.
The Trojans played poorly in
their upset loss to Washington
State last Saturday, guilty of a
ragged game strangely reminiscent
of Stanford's efforts last weekend.
If both teams repeat those
performances tonight, the ball
may never get past midcourt.
But SC (9-2) is capable of
playing much better. The Trojans
rebounded 48 hours after the
WSU upset to rout Washington
90-76. The hapless Huskies were
still licking their wounds after
their 100-48 mauling by the
Bruins, and the loss dropped their
record to 0-2, giving Stanford
some company in the conference
cellar.
The Trojan offense revolves
around the talented backcourt
tandem of senior Dan Anderson
(6-2) and Gus Williams (6-2),
whom Boyd describes as "the
most physically talented player
I've ever coached." Williams is the
third leading scorer in the Pac-8
with a 17.7 average, and is
connecting on better than half his
field goal attempts.

Anderson is second only to
some guy named Walton in field
goal shooting percentages at .604.
