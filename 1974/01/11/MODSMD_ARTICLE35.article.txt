# Shuffling The Cards
## Bruin Mystique Goes On And On 
### Dave Robinson 
The scene was St. Louis and the words
were familiar.
"I'm notsmart enough to get complicated,"
said John Wooden after his Bruins had coasted
past North Carolina State's disappointing
Wolfpack. "I just get 'em in shape and teach
'em the fundamentals — and I'm very quick to
chastise a player who's unselfish. Teamwork is
essential."
"Were you surprised," a reporter asked,
"that Walton played so aggressively even when
he had four fouls?"
"I don't teach players to play passively,
regardless of the situation," Wooden
responded.
It was the 79th victory in a row for the
Bruins, and it was accomplished even though
two-time player-of-the-year Bill Walton sat
helplessly on the bench for half the game.
Well, not exactly helplessly. "As long as
he's sitting there it gave them [N.C. State]
something to think about," Wooden said. "I
had a feeling we were going to win — even if I
didn't put him back in."
"Why were you so confident?" asked
another incredulous reporter, obviously
miffed at Wooden's nonchalance following a
victory which was in doubt until Walton
stepped back onto the floor.
"Because we have been able to win very
consistently, and I believe in percentages."
Seemingly Endless
"Very consistently" is one of those
understatements that ranks right up there
with President Nixon's admission that
Rosemary Woods "made a mistake." The
Bruins win with a consistency unmatched in
the world of sport. Tonight, California will
become victim number 86 in the seemingly
endless streak. Stanford should be number 87
tomorrow afternoon, and if all goes according
to schedule, the Cards will earn a rather

ignominious place in basketball record books
by becoming victim number 100 on March 2
at Maples Pavilion.
All of those victories and streaks are as dull
and unintersting as the UCLA practices, where
the amazing Bruins are finely tuned. Those
workouts, according to freshman
forward-center Richard Washington, are "so
drastically boring you wouldn't think
anything would come out of them."
But the practices are organized with
meticulous care by a coach who spends two or
three hours a day planning a two-hour
practice — organizing his thoughts and
practice plans onto painfully neat 3 by 5
cards.
At games, he sits tensely on the bench, a
rolled-up program in his right hand while his
left hand clutches a crucifix in his suit pocket.
"He's more like a minister than a coach," said
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's mother.
Jesus Christ
And Arnold Hano, the author of a Jabbar
biography to be published next year, says
"John Wooden comes as close to an
embodiment of Jesus Christ as anyone on the
current sporting scene."
His strongest known expression is
"Goodness gracious sakes alive," and he
dresses, according to one sportswriter, "with
all the sartorical splendor of an undertaker."
And John Wooden wins. Some have
doubted his methods, others have even
questioned his sincerity("He'sa sanctimonious
asshole," said one leading figure in the Pac-8
conference). But he commands respect, even
from players whose views are considerably
more progressive than their coach's, both
socially and politically. Two Bruins are
vegetarians, several are into meditation and
Walton passed out "Impeach Nixon" petitions
in the locker room.

"He I Wooden] didn't sign the petitions,"
said Washington, "but he didn't give Bill a
hard time, either. I guess he understands Bill,
that he is trying to fight against always being
associated with basketball, like he is struggling
for a new identity other than All-American."
Searching For Identity
Washington is also searching for an
identity. He is a freshman who came to UCLA
after a high school career filled with honors
and press clippings. Now he is merely a cog in
the machine, one of 17 Bruins who received
the following annual letter from Wooden over
the summer:
"Wear no mustache, beard or goatee; have
sideburns no longer than the top of the lobes
of your ears; have the hair of reasonable
length with the coaches being the judge as to
what is reasonable length."
"Haircuts and shaves, but that's a small
thing," Washington said. "From what I can
tell, I'm pretty sure I will be allowed to be a
person here and still play ball for a
champion."
That's why Wooden is besieged each year
by countless letters from countless high
school hotshots who share a common dream
— to play for Wooden's national champions.
Like this one from a 5-11 guard in Columbus
Junction, la.:
"Coach Wooden: Don't worry about my
size. I can dunk. I can also pass the ball
behind my back. Got quick hands and I once
made 50 straight free throws at the basket in
the vacant lot down by the Phillips 66 station.
I'm a cinch to make All-County this season.
Here's my picture. Regards to your wife, Nell,
and to Bill Walton. Keep the streak
going "
And going, and going, and going. ...

consistently, and I believe in percentages."
Seemingly Endless
"Very consistently" is one of those
understatements that ranks right up there
with President Nixon's admission that
Rosemary Woods "made a mistake." The
Bruins win with a consistency unmatched in
the world of sport. Tonight, California will
become victim number 86 in the seemingly
endless streak. Stanford should be number 87
tomorrow afternoon, and if all goes according
to schedule, the Cards will earn a rather

ignominious place in basketball record books
by becoming victim number 100 on March 2
at Maples Pavilion.
All of those victories and streaks are as dull
and unintersting as the UCLA practices, where
the amazing Bruins are finely tuned. Those
workouts, according to freshman
forward-center Richard Washington, are "so
drastically boring you wouldn't think
anything would come out of them."
But the practices are organized with
meticulous care by a coach who spends two or
three hours a day planning a two-hour
practice — organizing his thoughts and
practice plans onto painfully neat 3 by 5
cards.
At games, he sits tensely on the bench, a
rolled-up program in his right hand while his
left hand clutches a crucifix in his suit pocket.
"He's more like a minister than a coach," said
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's mother.
Jesus Christ
And Arnold Hano, the author of a Jabbar
biography to be published next year, says
"John Wooden comes as close to an
embodiment of Jesus Christ as anyone on the
current sporting scene."
His strongest known expression is
"Goodness gracious sakes alive," and he
dresses, according to one sportswriter, "with
all the sartorical splendor of an undertaker."
And John Wooden wins. Some have
doubted his methods, others have even
questioned his sincerity("He'sa sanctimonious
asshole," said one leading figure in the Pac-8
conference). But he commands respect, even
from players whose views are considerably
more progressive than their coach's, both
socially and politically. Two Bruins are
vegetarians, several are into meditation and
Walton passed out "Impeach Nixon" petitions
in the locker room.

"He I Wooden] didn't sign the petitions,"
said Washington, "but he didn't give Bill a
hard time, either. I guess he understands Bill,
that he is trying to fight against always being
associated with basketball, like he is struggling
for a new identity other than All-American."
Searching For Identity
Washington is also searching for an
identity. He is a freshman who came to UCLA
after a high school career filled with honors
and press clippings. Now he is merely a cog in
the machine, one of 17 Bruins who received
the following annual letter from Wooden over
the summer:
"Wear no mustache, beard or goatee; have
sideburns no longer than the top of the lobes
of your ears; have the hair of reasonable
length with the coaches being the judge as to
what is reasonable length."
"Haircuts and shaves, but that's a small
thing," Washington said. "From what I can
tell, I'm pretty sure I will be allowed to be a
person here and still play ball for a
champion."
That's why Wooden is besieged each year
by countless letters from countless high
school hotshots who share a common dream
— to play for Wooden's national champions.
Like this one from a 5-11 guard in Columbus
Junction, la.:
"Coach Wooden: Don't worry about my
size. I can dunk. I can also pass the ball
behind my back. Got quick hands and I once
made 50 straight free throws at the basket in
the vacant lot down by the Phillips 66 station.
I'm a cinch to make All-County this season.
Here's my picture. Regards to your wife, Nell,
and to Bill Walton. Keep the streak
going "
And going, and going, and going. ...
The scene was St. Louis and the words
were familiar.
"I'm notsmart enough to get complicated,"
said John Wooden after his Bruins had coasted
past North Carolina State's disappointing
Wolfpack. "I just get 'em in shape and teach
'em the fundamentals — and I'm very quick to
chastise a player who's unselfish. Teamwork is
essential."
"Were you surprised," a reporter asked,
"that Walton played so aggressively even when
he had four fouls?"
"I don't teach players to play passively,
regardless of the situation," Wooden
responded.
It was the 79th victory in a row for the
Bruins, and it was accomplished even though
two-time player-of-the-year Bill Walton sat
helplessly on the bench for half the game.
Well, not exactly helplessly. "As long as
he's sitting there it gave them [N.C. State]
something to think about," Wooden said. "I
had a feeling we were going to win — even if I
didn't put him back in."
"Why were you so confident?" asked
another incredulous reporter, obviously
miffed at Wooden's nonchalance following a
victory which was in doubt until Walton
stepped back onto the floor.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's mother.
Jesus Christ
And Arnold Hano, the author of a Jabbar
biography to be published next year, says
"John Wooden comes as close to an
embodiment of Jesus Christ as anyone on the
current sporting scene."
His strongest known expression is
"Goodness gracious sakes alive," and he
dresses, according to one sportswriter, "with
all the sartorical splendor of an undertaker."
And John Wooden wins. Some have
doubted his methods, others have even
questioned his sincerity("He'sa sanctimonious
asshole," said one leading figure in the Pac-8
conference). But he commands respect, even
from players whose views are considerably
more progressive than their coach's, both
socially and politically. Two Bruins are
vegetarians, several are into meditation and
Walton passed out "Impeach Nixon" petitions
in the locker room.

"He I Wooden] didn't sign the petitions,"
said Washington, "but he didn't give Bill a
hard time, either. I guess he understands Bill,
that he is trying to fight against always being
associated with basketball, like he is struggling
for a new identity other than All-American."
Searching For Identity
Washington is also searching for an
identity. He is a freshman who came to UCLA
after a high school career filled with honors
and press clippings. Now he is merely a cog in
the machine, one of 17 Bruins who received
the following annual letter from Wooden over
the summer:
"Wear no mustache, beard or goatee; have
sideburns no longer than the top of the lobes
of your ears; have the hair of reasonable
length with the coaches being the judge as to
what is reasonable length."
"Haircuts and shaves, but that's a small
thing," Washington said. "From what I can
tell, I'm pretty sure I will be allowed to be a
person here and still play ball for a
champion."
That's why Wooden is besieged each year
by countless letters from countless high
school hotshots who share a common dream
— to play for Wooden's national champions.
Like this one from a 5-11 guard in Columbus
Junction, la.:
"Coach Wooden: Don't worry about my
size. I can dunk. I can also pass the ball
behind my back. Got quick hands and I once
made 50 straight free throws at the basket in
the vacant lot down by the Phillips 66 station.
I'm a cinch to make All-County this season.
Here's my picture. Regards to your wife, Nell,
and to Bill Walton. Keep the streak
going "
And going, and going, and going. ...
The scene was St. Louis and the words
were familiar.
"I'm notsmart enough to get complicated,"
said John Wooden after his Bruins had coasted
past North Carolina State's disappointing
Wolfpack. "I just get 'em in shape and teach
'em the fundamentals — and I'm very quick to
chastise a player who's unselfish. Teamwork is
essential."
"Were you surprised," a reporter asked,
"that Walton played so aggressively even when
he had four fouls?"
"I don't teach players to play passively,
regardless of the situation," Wooden
responded.
It was the 79th victory in a row for the
Bruins, and it was accomplished even though
two-time player-of-the-year Bill Walton sat
helplessly on the bench for half the game.
Well, not exactly helplessly. "As long as
he's sitting there it gave them [N.C. State]
something to think about," Wooden said. "I
had a feeling we were going to win — even if I
didn't put him back in."
"Why were you so confident?" asked
another incredulous reporter, obviously
miffed at Wooden's nonchalance following a
victory which was in doubt until Walton
stepped back onto the floor.
"Because we have been able to win very
consistently, and I believe in percentages."
Seemingly Endless
"Very consistently" is one of those
understatements that ranks right up there
with President Nixon's admission that
Rosemary Woods "made a mistake." The
Bruins win with a consistency unmatched in
the world of sport. Tonight, California will
become victim number 86 in the seemingly
endless streak. Stanford should be number 87
tomorrow afternoon, and if all goes according
to schedule, the Cards will earn a rather

ignominious place in basketball record books
by becoming victim number 100 on March 2
at Maples Pavilion.
All of those victories and streaks are as dull
and unintersting as the UCLA practices, where
the amazing Bruins are finely tuned. Those
workouts, according to freshman
forward-center Richard Washington, are "so
drastically boring you wouldn't think
anything would come out of them."
But the practices are organized with
meticulous care by a coach who spends two or
three hours a day planning a two-hour
practice — organizing his thoughts and
practice plans onto painfully neat 3 by 5
cards.
At games, he sits tensely on the bench, a
rolled-up program in his right hand while his
left hand clutches a crucifix in his suit pocket.
