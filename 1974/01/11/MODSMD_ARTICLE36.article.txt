# 'Youth Of Eternal Spring'
## 
### 
Kuo Lien Ying, an 80
year-old master in the
Chinese martial art of Tai
Chi Chuan, is teaching the
newly organized Stanford
Tai Chi Chuan club, which
meets from 4-6 p.m. on
Mondays at the Women's
Clubhouse (P.E. 137 C).
"Tai Chi Chuan,"
according to Lien Ying,
"consists of 64 motions. It
is good for men and
women, the young and old
alike. They can all practice
it. When a healthy person
practices it, it will make
him healthy all the time.
When a sick person
practices it, it will cure his
sickness. It can also help
people to recover their
mental stability and build
up strength in the body.
"As the motion is
neither slow nor fast, it is
easy to practice. You can
finish practicing one set of
Tai Chi Chuan in 10 to 15
minutes. Tai Chi Chuan is
passive in its application.
Its softness can overcome
hardness; its slowness can
overcome what is fast. It
changes wonderfully in
facing the opponent's
motion. The end purpose
of Tai Chi Chuan is to
prolong life and endow it
with the youth of eternal
spring."
