Jaworski Offers Ehrlichman 'Deal'?
LOS ANGELES — Former presidential adviser John D.
Ehrlichman was offered a deal by special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski in return for his cooperation in
Watergate-related prosecutions, the Los Angeles Times
reported in today's editions.
The deal, the newspaper said, reportedly included the
opportunity to plead guilty to one felony count in
exchange for Ehrlichman's cooperation in the prosecution
of other Watergate figures.
The Times quoted an unnamed Washington source as
saying Jaworski's office made the same offer to Ehrlichman
as was extended to and rejected by former Atty. Gen. John
N. Mitchell.
Ehrlichman's chief Washington attorney, John J. Wilson,
acknowledged that Ehrlichman and Jaworski met for 65
minutes yesterday, but he declined to discuss what they
talked about, the Times said.
Ehrlichman has not been charged in connection with the
Watergate investigations. He is under indictment in Los
Angeles for burglary, conspiracy and perjury in connection
with the September 1971 break-in at the office of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
'U.S. Military Spied On Kissinger"
CHICAGO — A 1971 White House investigation
disclosed that top military men conducted a campaign of
spying and eavesdropping on Henry A. Kissinger, the
Chicago Tribune said in its editions today.
The Tribune said the investigation turned up evidence
that a spy in Kissinger's National Security Council office
passed top secret information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
including the chairman, Adm. Thomas H. Moorer.
The White House investigation was carried out by the
White House plumbers unit and is the "national security
matter" frequently cited by President Nixon as his reason
for setting up the unit, the newspaper said.
The Tribune said White House special counsel J. Fred
Buzhardt said the story contained a "fundamental
inaccuracy." But it said he said no story "can be totally
accurate on this case."
The newspaper said sources who told of the investigation
were unable to produce any proof that Moorer was
personally involved in the alleged spying campaign. But it
said the probe resulted in "informal allegations" against
him.
Diplomats Reveal Mideast 'Peace Plan'
LONDON — Senior diplomats disclosed yesterday what
they described as the five main elements of Israel's plan for
the disengagement of Israeli and Egyptian forces in the
Suez Canal zone.
They said U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will
present the plan to President Anwar Sadat of Egypt today.
There was no confirmation of these diplomatic reports
from official quarters in Washington or Tel Aviv.
In Washington, Kissinger said he expects his trip to the
Middle East to produce a basis of negotiations between
Egypt and Israel on disengagement of their forces near the
Suez Canal.
Kissinger was scheduled to leave at midnight for Egypt
with a brief stop along the way in Spain. He said he will
take to President Anwar Sadat of Egypt some "general
ideas" about disengagement and then, in Israel, see whether
a concrete proposal for disengagement can be reached.
Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban said in Jerusalem
that Israel is awaiting Kissinger's visit to that capital before
deciding on final proposals for separating forces.
The informants in London said the Israeli plan is this:
— Withdrawal of all Israeli forces from their positions on
both sides of the canal to a line 12V& to 18 miles eastward.

- A cutback of Egyptian forces on the east bank to a
point that would reduce it to token proportions.
— Demilitarization of all intervening Sinai territory plus
the establishment of a string of United Nations observation
posts between the Israeli and Egyptian positions.
— Action to clear the Suez Canal of its obstructions in
order to reopen the waterway to the ships of all countries
including Israel.
- Alongside these first stage steps toward a complete
settlement Israel wants Egypt to join in an agreed definition
of the nature and quality of the final peace contract.
Police Suspect Fair In Foster Slaying
OAK'-AND — Two men arrested yesterday after a
shootout in nearby Concord may be linked to the
assassination of school Supt. Marcus Foster in early
November, police said.
Oakland police said "a large quantity of Symbionese
Liberation Army literature" was found in a van recovered
by Concord police after the shootout. The same group sent
letters to newspapers and a radio station claiming
responsibility for killing Foster with poisoned bullets as he
left the administration building last Nov. 6.
Two men were held on $250,000 bond each at Contra
Costa County Jail at Martinez for investigation of assault on
a police officer with intent to commit murder. Russell
Little, 27, of Oakland, and Joseph Michael Remiro, 27, of
San Francisco were to be arraigned today.
Oakland police also said that several weapons were
found in the van and that ballistics tests were underway. A
source in the department said one of the weapons was a
.38-caliber automatic pistol similar to the one police
believed was used to kill Foster.
Reagan Proposes $9.8 Billion Budget
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan proposed an
austere $9.8 billion state budget yesterday, balancing it by
deep cuts in state construction programs and optimistic
revenue estimates.
The eighth and final budget of the Reagan
administration proposes a slim 1.6 percent over-all increase
in state spending. It also predicts a 1.1 percent general fund
surplus by mid-1975.
It is balanced with a revenue projection which is based
on the assumption that the state will weather the energy
crisis without a prolonged economic slump.
The Republican governor's total spending proposal for
the fiscal year starting next July 1 is $9,812,470,481.
That would be an increase of $168.4 million over the
$9.64 billion California will spend during the current fiscal
year.
But it is $554 million more than the 1973-74 budget
Reagan recommended last January. It would hike per capita
spending by $8.29 — to a new record high of $478.20 for
each California resident.
Republican leaders praised Reagan for balancing his
budget without a tax increase. Democrats challenged
whether the Reagan budget is workable and accused him of
protecting loopholes for big tax' ~rs.
The budget proposes increase except the
one-penny-per-dollar sales tax hike which was imposed and
then temporarily repealed last year.
This is the first step in a five-month process of public
hearings. The final budget must be adopted by a two-thirds
vote of the Democrat-controlled legislature. It is subject to
item veto by the governor, who is required to sign it by
midnight June 30.
Reagan proposes no new state programs. His budget in
most areas barely matches cost-of-living increases.
He proposes increases of 3.8 percent for local schools,
8.5 percent for higher education and 9.7 percent for state

operations. He cuts construction funds by 56.1 percent,
from $561 million in the current fiscal year to $317
million.
Local Firms Receive Extortion Notes
SAN FRANCISCO — Several major companies in the
San Francisco Bay Area have received mimeographed letters
demanding payments of $1 million to be distributed in
"Robin Hood" fashion to exploited people.
The FBI has been given the copies of letters received by
the Bank of America, Standard Oil of California, Pacific
Gas and Electric and Pacific Telephone, said Thomas
Druken, assistant special agent in charge.
"One or two other corporations" also received similar
letters yesterday or Wednesday, he said, but refused to
identify them.
The letters, signed by the Economic Liberation Cadre,
have been sent to the FBI Laboratories in Washington,
D.C., for further examination, he said.
The letters that demanded the money in 10s, 20s, 50s
and 100s be delivered to various locations in the Bay Area at
various times over the weekend. The letters were identical
except for the names of the companies and the sites and
times of payoffs.
k U.S. To Sell Iran 30 F-14 Jets'
NEW YORK — The United States plans to sell 30 F-14
jet fighters to Iran for $900 million, ABC News said
last night.

The missile-carrying aircraft are expected to be delivered
in early 1976 and will give Iran a military edge over any
nation in the Middle East, the news report said.
ABC News Editor Jules Bergman said the U.S. Defense
Department refused to comment on the story of the
intended sale of F-14 "Tomcat" fighters.
(<hapin Requests Trial Reloeation
WASHINGTON — Dwight L. Chapin, the former
presidential appointments secretary charged with lying
under oath, has asked that his trial be moved from
Washington. He said he fears the city's predominant black
population will make a fair hearing difficult.
Chapin contends, in a petition filed late Wednesday in
district court, that blacks on a jury panel would be
particularly offended" by racial campaign tactics he
allegedly approved.
In addition, the paper said, 78 percent of District of
Columbia voters were for Sen. George McGovern, the
Democratic candidate, in the election.
Chapin indicated he might be satisfied with Des Moines
lowa for the trial.
