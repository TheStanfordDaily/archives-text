# County Fixes Junipero Serra
## 
### MARY PICKETT 
Improvements on Junipero Serra
Boulevard, approved at a December
meeting of the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, are nearly
completed, Supervisor Victor Calvo
said yesterday.
The improvements — narrowing the
lanes and adding reflectors and bicycle
paths — are almost finished, Calvo
said. He added that traffic lights at the
intersection of Mayfield Avenue will
be installed "within 90 days.
"We have some equipment but it
has to be modified," he said. "We also
have to do some surface work before
the lights can be put in because of the
sharp angle of the intersection."
Calvo said that county funds would
be used for the installation of the
signals.
The supervisors also considered
other measures to improve the safety
of a stretch of Junipero Serra where
there have been seven fatalities since
1968. These include a reduction of the
speed limit from 45 to 35 mph
between Mayfield and Alpine Avenues.
The supervisors also debated hiring a
consultant to make an
origin-and-destination traffic study to
determine the impact of a partial or
total closure of Junipero Serra.
After the latest fatalities there in
September, the Stanford Campus
Home Owners Association (SCHO)

requested the county and University
to improve the dangerous section of
the road.
The board also passed a
right-turn-only modification of traffic
movement onto and off of Junipero
Serra at Santa Maria.
Last fall, Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira,
member of SCHO and resident of San
Juan Hills which borders Junipero
Serra, suggested that Santa Maria be
completely closed becauseof its "lethal"
intersection with the county road.
"We are pleased with the action the
board has taken, but we're not
completely satisfied. We'll wait and see

what happens in the near future," said
Oiiveira.
Other stop signs in addition to the
new ones recently placed along
Miranda Avenue and signs warning of
dangerous curves and children playing
are still needed, Oiiveira said.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, SCHO
member, was "grateful to the board
for initiating meaningful action, but
more has to be done," he said.
He said Junipero Serra carries more
traffic than it was designed for and the
county should look to solve that
problem.

signals.
The supervisors also considered
other measures to improve the safety
of a stretch of Junipero Serra where
there have been seven fatalities since
1968. These include a reduction of the
speed limit from 45 to 35 mph
between Mayfield and Alpine Avenues.
The supervisors also debated hiring a
consultant to make an
origin-and-destination traffic study to
determine the impact of a partial or
total closure of Junipero Serra.
After the latest fatalities there in
September, the Stanford Campus
Home Owners Association (SCHO)

requested the county and University
to improve the dangerous section of
the road.
The board also passed a
right-turn-only modification of traffic
movement onto and off of Junipero
Serra at Santa Maria.
Last fall, Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira,
member of SCHO and resident of San
Juan Hills which borders Junipero
Serra, suggested that Santa Maria be
completely closed becauseof its "lethal"
intersection with the county road.
"We are pleased with the action the
board has taken, but we're not
completely satisfied. We'll wait and see

what happens in the near future," said
Oiiveira.
Other stop signs in addition to the
new ones recently placed along
Miranda Avenue and signs warning of
dangerous curves and children playing
are still needed, Oiiveira said.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, SCHO
member, was "grateful to the board
for initiating meaningful action, but
more has to be done," he said.
He said Junipero Serra carries more
traffic than it was designed for and the
county should look to solve that
problem.
