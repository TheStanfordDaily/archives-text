# Jailed Radical Freed
## 
### 
Former campus radical James Edward Johnson has been freed from jail and is
now in New York, friends have told the Daily.
Johnson, 29, left the country in March, 1971 after congressional testimony
by informer Thomas Edward Mosher accused him of involvement in several area
bombings in 1969 and 1970. Johnson was arrested last year in Trinidad and
returned to the West Coast by way of San Juan, P.R., to face
previously-outstanding charges in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz
Counties.
Johnson pleaded guilty to Santa Clara County charges of assaulting a peace
officer and served the remainder of a seven-month sentence. Meanwhile, charges
of illegal possession of firearms in San Mateo county and illegal possession of
explosives in Santa Cruz County were dropped.
Johnson was reportedly questioned in San Juan by the FBI on his knowledge
of radical activities in the late 19605.
He is apparently visiting relatives and friends say he has not made further
plans.
