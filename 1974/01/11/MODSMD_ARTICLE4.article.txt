# Faculty Senate Defers Decision On ROTC
## 
### DIANE NORBURG 
The Faculty Senate yesterday,
acting as a committee of the whole,
voted to postpone indefinitely the
consideration of an ROTC
reinstatement here.
The decision, called a
"parliamentary limbo" by one Senate
member, ended an hour-and-a-half
debate on the ROTC issue. The
discussion, which carried the Senate
45 minutes past its customary time of
adjournment, did not begin until after
demonstrators discontinued their
protest (see related article).
The effect of dissolving into a
committee of the whole is that the
decision is considered a straw vote and
not a part of official Senate action.
The future of the ROTC issue is up
to the Senate steering committee
which will slate the issue for later
consideration.
"The next step will be for the
Senate to schedule the matter for
official action, but when we just don't
know now," Academic Secretary H.
Donald Winbigler said after the
meeting.
Unofficial Action
Senate by-laws stipulate that when
the Senate acts as a committee of the
whole the media cannot record any
vote results nor attribute statements
made in debate to any Senate member.
It is therefore impossible to print
the debate which led to the
postponement decision. Within the
debate, however, there was heavy
emphasis on the feeling that campus
attitudes toward the ROTC program
have not altered enough to warrant the
possibility of reinstatement.
The lack of student input was a
primary factor in the vote for
postponement. One Senate member
said that Senate action would be
foolish when it is not known whether
any student here would enroll in an

ROTC program even if it were to be
resumed.
A second major reason for
postponement was that some Senate
members said their own feelings
toward the presence of a military
establishment on campus had not
changed since they voted in 1970 to
phase out the ROTC programs here.
Research Urged
Other members called for extensive
research prior to consideration of
reinstatement, urging a study of the
contract finalized between Princeton
and the Army. Princeton is the only
university known to the Senate which
once banned ROTC from its campus
and later resumed the program.
Questions about the academic
worth of the ROTC program within
the university structure dominated the
debate. Some members expressed
concern that the University could not
determine exactly what a reinstated
program would be without opening
negotiations with the Department of
Defense.
Graduate Report
In other regularly scheduled action,
the Senate accepted a report from
Dean of Graduate Studies Lincoln
Moses, who assessed the Affirmative
Action program in graduate studies.
Moses presented a two-part report
on women and on ethnic minorities,
which include black, Chicano and
native American students. He stated
that the number of ethnic minority
students in graduate programs here has
risen from 83 in 1968 to 465 in 1973.
Although new enrollments this year
by ethnic minority students dropped
slightly from the 1972 level, Moses
said that increases were found in the
business, law and medical schools. The
largest enrollment increase occurred in
the Chicano group, he said.
Moses said that his statistics on
women graduate students show a

much lower dropout rate among
women than men. While 27 percent of
male third-year graduate students do
not return to complete their degree,
only 18 percent of female third-year
students fail to return.
Moses said that the percentage of
women receiving Ph.D.s here had been
much lower than the national average
in the past, but is now comparable to
it. On Senate recommendation, Moses
agreed to present his findings in a
written report.
