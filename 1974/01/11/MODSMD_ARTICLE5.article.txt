# Pickets Oppose Reinstatement Of ROTC
## 
### 
About 85 demonstrators picketed
the Faculty Senate meeting yesterday
afternoon in a low-key protest against
the possible reinstatement of ROTC.
The demonstrators, some bearing
placards inscribed, "Frag ROTC,"
"Let Sleeping Monsters Lie," and
"David Starr Jordan Opposed ROTC,"
marched peacefully for about an hour
outside Room 75 of the Graduate
School of Business where the meeting
was held.
The group, chilled by an icy winter
wind, appeared to include a large
number of veterans of earlier battles,
including the one that culminated in
1970 with the University decision to
phase out ROTC.
University President Richard
Lyman stopped briefly outside the
meeting to chat with a demonstrator
about David Starr Jordan's position on
ROTC, while Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig looked on.
During the meeting the
demonstrators broke into occasional
chants and cheers, including a "Stop
ROTC" spell-out and a take-off on one
of the rallying chants of many anti-war
demonstrations: "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi
Minh, ROTC Must Not Begin." The
chants were audible inside the
meeting.
The demonstration ended before
the ROTC issue came up for
discussion. One organizer noted
afterwards that the Faculty Senate
meeting yesterday was "very
preliminary," and that if the
movement for reinstatement gained
any momentum, anti-ROTC groups
might begin a more intensive
"educational campaign" against it.
However, "the best thing would
obviously be to nip it in the bud," the
protester noted.
