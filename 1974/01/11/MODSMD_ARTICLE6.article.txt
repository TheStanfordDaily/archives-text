# Energy Buggy Cruises Campus

What's red and white and driven all
over?
The Stanford Energy Conservation
Buggy.
Part of an energy-saving drive begun
by Plant Services Director Dan
DeYoung, the two-seater white truck
now cruising around campus runs on
batteries — for about a penny a mile.
Decorated with signs proclaiming
its purpose in loyal Stanford colors,
the buggy — on loan from Pacific, Gas
and Electric (PG&E) — has attracted a
good deal of attention. "It's a mobile
billboard," says DeYoung happily.
"It uses about an eighth of the

energy used by internal combustion
engines," DeYoung explains. "One
barrel of oil will make enough
electricity [to charge the batteries] to
run it 100 miles."
Carrying building inspector
Benjamin Castillo and any of 13
student helpers to the scene of an
unnecessary light bulb, the buggy
testifies to the campus public that
Stanford wants to conserve energy.
The heat, light and water bills for
academic facilities along cost the
University $1.6 million last year; this
amount is expected to climb another
$200,000 in 1974. By contrast, the
bill in 1967 was $760,000.

DeYoung emphasizes that these
costs exclude dormitory expenses. The
University's total outlay for utilities
last year was $2.5 million. Stanford's
energy czar calculated that $200 of a
student's yearly tuition goes to keep
buildings warm and light.
Students and staff have handed
over more than 2000 light bulbs to the
Conservation Buggy team since
DeYoung first announced his
campaign Nov. 6. The team measures
the illumination of offices and
departments against standards set by
the American Society of Illumination
Engineers. The disparity prompted
willing responses from those working
in overly-lighted areas to cut back.
"In most places, they (secretaries,
faculty] like it better," DeYoung
maintains. "The ladies say it should
have been done before."
DeYoung has brainstormed slogans
for luminescent stickers like "Cool It"
— to be affixed to radiators — and
"Off It," a reminder for light switches.
Another admonishes, "Kill a watt!"
DeYoung's favorite is: "Shower in the
dark."
Judging from the pile of fluorescent
light tubes piled behind the Plant
Services building, it seems the
campaign has paid off. The Energy
Bug has been contributing its share of
bulbs for about three weeks. Two
more carts, also on loan from PG&E,
are awaiting new batteries before they
will begin their beats as shop truck and
grounds debris collector.
A ride in the buggy is bouncy and
breezy. Seat belts will be installed
soon, but not doors. Like any
self-respecting vehicle, the buggy has
signals and a horn. What's more, it
starts without a hitch at the turn of
the key — except, of course, when the
batteries run down. The buggy
averages a brisk 15 miles per hour in
service lanes; however on the open
road, it can reach a maximum of 27
miles per hour.

LIGHTING BUG — This battery powered "energy buggy" has been zipping around campus recently in search of all
unnecessary light bulbs. The Conservation Buggy Team has collected over 2000 bulbs since its campaign began.
