## Fire Dept. Problems 
### 
The Stanford Fire Department responds to about 250 rescue calls
each year, ranging from heart attacks to injuries and auto accidents,
and firemen use rescue equipment — first aid kits, resuscitators,
forcible entry equipment, hydraulic tools, and the like — on all other
emergency calls.
This sounds impressive enough, but it means next to nothing,
because the department doesn't have a vehicle to carry its rescue
equipment. And if budget-cutters in the University bureaucracy
prevail, it won't have an adequate rescue unit any time soon.
Last year the fire department received funding for two new 2000
gallon per minute pumpers, at $60,000 each. True, the department
needed new apparatus to maintain Stanford's insurance rating; but its
administrators failed to plan for rescue capability when they opted
for the new engines, even though almost one-third of their
emergency responses are rescue calls.
This bad planning has returned to haunt the department. Fire
Chief Frank Jurian has requested a $7000 rescue vehicle three times
in the last 10 months, but his superiors have rejected each request.
The University has spent $180,000 to try fired English Prof. Bruce
Franklin and $400,000 to put tunnels in the stadium, but it
apparently can't scrape up $7000.
Instead, University officials want to convert Engine 97, a 1500
gallon per minute pumper, into a rescue unit.
This approach reduces the usefulness of a first-line engine and
ignores the nature of rescue work. A rescue unit must sometimes
drive through soft dirt and mud, which the engine would sink to its
axles in; and it must slip into narrow, inaccessible places around
campus, which the big pumper is not small or manueverable enough
for.
Furthermore, the University will probably lose money by
converting Engine 97. A rescue unit, which responds on every call,
wears out more quickly than an engine. Apparently Stanford would
prefer to replace a $50,000 pumper rather than a .$7OOO light truck.
Virtually all the rescue gear is still on Rescue 95, a relic from
1945 which has been out of service for a month with a blown head
gasket — its second in a year. Mechanics still don't know when parts
for it will arrive.
Even when it's repaired, Rescue 95 won't last long. It has been the
first unit out — responding on every emergency call — for almost 30
years and about 400,000 miles. It's simply worn out. The
department will sell it as surplus in April.
For a while during 1973, the department used a converted library
van, originally acquired to carry bomb disposal gear, as a rescue unit.
When University administrators realized that it was being used on
rescue calls, they ordered it returned to the bomb squad — which is
probably just as well.
The van, the American equivalent of a Volkswagen microbus, was
dreadfully overloaded, but still did not hold all the rescue
equipment; and it had a nasty tendency to roll on turns, prompting
some of its drivers to wish for training wheels.
As if this wasn't enough, it had carburetor trouble. Firemen once
had to transfer first aid gear to an engine before responding to a
double-fatality auto accident because the van failed to start.
While the fire department waits for its new engines and decides
whether or not to convert Engine 97, it has no rescue vehicle at all.
An engine temporarily doubles as a rescue, carrying a resuscitator
and first aid kit, but the rest of the rescue gear stays in the station.
If firemen need special equipment to free someone trapped in an
automobile wreck on Interstate 280, or saw into a burning building,
they must radio back to the station for it, and wait.
