## Embo Law School Prep Course 
### 
Good morning pre-law red-hots! All set for another
quarter of nose grinding, pencil pushing competition?
You'd better be, unless the Happy Hollow Nighttime Law
School's the only one to which you've sent applications.
Now we all have heard stories about pre-med
competition: how at times it goes beyond the
self-improvement ethos towards that of
hurt-thy-neighbors'-chances.
Maybe you're acquainted with the scare stories ... you
know, pouring isoglutamic acid in the other guy's
serotonin solution while he's up talking to the T.A. And
of course before he knows it, his solution has degenerated
into a beta complex which gives him an "F" on the
experiment.
That one F means a little more effort needs be put out
on the final to get an A for the course, and a lot more
anxiety the night before.
Pre-meds Aren't Alone
Poppycock you say? C'mon ... we know it happens
.. . maybe not at Stanford but certainly in the hundreds
of undergrad labs up at Berkeley. The question for today
is, do pre-meds have any monopoly on such skullduggery?
What about pre-law?
Competition for law school is getting tough, and at the
top schools, tougher. Stanford teaches one to go for the
best, but if that's your attitude about where to apply . . .
well, going for all the gusto means aiming a hell of a lot
higher than the Schlitz School of Law.
And chances are, wherever you do aim, there'll be
others with as good or better records after that same one
spot. So don't be left behind in the use of underhanded
tactics by your pre-med brethren.
Remember Watergate?
And don't hold yourself back with notions about
ethics: look at all the lawyers in this country today who
got to the top without ethics.
Now's the time to start eliminating the competition
before they eliminate you. Put your mind at ease and
your future in competent hands by registering now for a
three week Law School Preparation Course at your local
Bosco Embo Educational Extension Center.
At Embo, we'll teach you not only how to improve
your LSAT score, but how to maximize every possible
variable leading toward successful admission into the law
school of your choice.
The Highway To Easy Street
Unlike other preparation courses, Embo doesn't waste
your time with dozens of practice LSAT tests. Instead, as
soon as we receive your $250 check (modest course fee),
we'll speed back to you — in a plain manila envelope — a
list of up to 25 people in your area who scored 800' son
past LSAT exams and are willing to act as ringers just for
you.
Yes , these genius test takers will sit in your place, sign
your name with polished accuracy, and even provide a
fingerprint: YOUR fingerprint on their finger, made
possible through the development of high impact skin
putty.
That should solve half your admission problem right
there. As for the grades, I'm afraid you'll have to work on
those without the aid of a ringer. But Embo will train you
to make those A's come as easy as honev to the bee. All it

takes are some simple techniques in elbowing your
classmates off the racetrack. Here follow two schemes
that should get you off to a good start.
The Book Buying Technique
First, get a hold of the book list of some Poli Sci
course that is a pre-law must: Con. Law, Supreme Court,
etc. Then buy all the books from the bookstore — every
one on the shelf. Go to bookstores in town and at nearby
universities and buy their copies up too. Many students
will drop out of the course just because they fear falling
behind without a book.
As for the hardy ones who remain, you can sell them
books at a tidy profit, and make the sale price include a
signed, notarized statement that they will not apply to the
same schools you are. Of, course, this transaction should
be done at secret drop-off points and by intermediaries so
your own identity will remain unknown.
But some just won't scare that easily, so you must
arrange for them to do rather poorly, gradewise. Just steal
their case summaries one night and type "Injunction"
wherever "Habeas Corpus" appears, change case dates,
and alter the names of judges giving the opinions of the
Court. Do it neatly though so it's not noticed until too
late. That should fix your challengers' wagon the next
time they speak up in class.
Results of Embo Prep Course
In fact, one of the Embo instructors sitting in on an
undergraduate constitutional law course last quarter heard
this exchange — undoubtedly caused by an anonymous
Embo prep course graduate:
Professor: Would you please explain to the class the
facts of the Pentagon Papers Case, Mr. ... Connell.
Connell: (smugly confident, glancing at his notes)
Certainly sir. The case involves Democratic President
Warren G. Harding, who during the Civil War ... ah ... he
had some top secret documents . . . well, actually they
were presidential papers ... ah, the Pentagon Papers
some called them, and ah
Professor: (annoyed) I think we've wasted enough
time. Mr. Connell, here is a dime; take it, call your
mother, and tell her there's serious doubt of your ever
getting an A in this class.
Connell: (flustered) But sir! Wait! I may not know the
case, but do you want to hear me do a fantastic imitation
of Euell Gibbons eating wild broccoli with Justice William
O. Douglas? Oh, and by the way, the phone outside is
broken, so could I have a quarter?
Do you honestly think a guy like that could get into
Harvard Law, or for that matter, even Happy Hollow
Nighttime?
See how easy it is to get rid of your competition? .. .
and so fun too! Sign up today for the Embo preparatory
coursc. One of our course representatives will be in the
Palo Alto area this coming week and plans to make a
broadcast advertisement on your campus radio station,
KZSU, 90.1 FM, next Monday night at 6:30 p.m. sharp.
Listen in and your LSAT score should go up at least 15
points.
