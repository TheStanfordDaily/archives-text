## Viewers Can't Find Kohoutek's Comet 
### SANDY WHITE 
About 150 people showed up
for "the once in a million years
treat" Thursday night at the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Standing in front of Purity
Market, squinting towards Venus
and Jupiter, the amateur
sky-watchers searched vainly for
the fizzling-sizzling Comet
Kohoutek.
It should have been one of the
best nights to see Kohoutek, but
the weather was uncooperative.
Clouds of fog obscured the
southwestern sky, and the already

dim comet escaped even the
largest telescopes brought out for
the occasion.
Members of the Peninsula
Astronomical Society
enthusiastically pointed out
Satum, Venus, Jupiter and Mars,
but the faithful would not give
up. "When can we see the comet?
When can we see the comet?"
chanted the children.
No one could answer them.
Everyone waited patiently in line
to look at the two moons of
Jupiter, hoping that a miracle
would clear the fog and expose
