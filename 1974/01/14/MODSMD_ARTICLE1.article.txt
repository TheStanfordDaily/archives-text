## Viewers Can't Find Kohoutek's Comet 
### SANDY WHITE 
About 150 people showed up
for "the once in a million years
treat" Thursday night at the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Standing in front of Purity
Market, squinting towards Venus
and Jupiter, the amateur
sky-watchers searched vainly for
the fizzling-sizzling Comet
Kohoutek.
It should have been one of the
best nights to see Kohoutek, but
the weather was uncooperative.
Clouds of fog obscured the
southwestern sky, and the already

dim comet escaped even the
largest telescopes brought out for
the occasion.
Members of the Peninsula
Astronomical Society
enthusiastically pointed out
Satum, Venus, Jupiter and Mars,
but the faithful would not give
up. "When can we see the comet?
When can we see the comet?"
chanted the children.
No one could answer them.
Everyone waited patiently in line
to look at the two moons of
Jupiter, hoping that a miracle
would clear the fog and expose

the comet. Several people had seen it
Tuesday, but even they couldn't locate
the elusive Kohoutek Thursday night.
Overbilled
Despite the efforts of prophets and
soothsayers, astronomers and
astrologers, and clever businessmen
looking for a gimmick, Kohoutek's
comet is simply not living up to its
billing as the most spectacular comet
ever to hit the skies.
In keeping with a current trend,
many people accuse astronomers of
perpetrating a hoax to win more
research grants. Putting such cynicism
aside, the question remains: where is
Kohoutek and what is it trying to
hide?
Kohoutek's reluctance to show
itself upset many theories. The
Children of God may not need their
end-of-the-world stockpiles just yet.
Those who tried to blame the energy
crisis, Watergate, rising prices or the
Super Bowl on the comet now have
little evidence for their accusations.
'Dirty Snowball'
Even the scientific "dirty
snowball" theory, which fits other
comets — including Halley's — doesn't
apply to the temperamental
Kohoutek. Astronomers used that
theory to accurately predict
Kohoutek's position in the sky, but
their predictions about its appearance
were way off.
Scientists speculated that comet
tails were made of ice covered with
dust which reflects the sunlight; thus
the "dirty snowball." According to
that theory, Kohoutek would have
been brighter than the moon. Instead,
at its brightest, it was only of the third
magnitude, and the human eye can
only see to the fifth magnitude. In
urban areas, smog reflects city lights
onto the sky, making it very difficult
to see the comet without binoculars.
Comets baffle astronomers in many

ways. One similar to Kohoutek was
discovered in 1948, but when it passed
behind the sun, it disintegrated. If
scientists can determine the
composition of the comet head, they
say they may be able to solve such
puzzles.
Laboratory
Kohoutek has served as a
laboratory for astronomers, who for
the first time are using spectroscopy to
find out just what's in a comet. Some
scientists believe that comets may be
cosmological fossils, unchanged for
five billion years. If so, they may
provide clues to the origin of the sun.
Researchers from Stanford to Skylab
have already made some exciting
discoveries.
Methyl cyanide and hydrogen
cyanide are molecules usually found in
gas clouds, explains Nick Suntzeff of
the Stanford Observatory. But they
have been found in Kohoutek's tail,
and may account for some of the
differences between Halley and
Kohoutek.
Dr. Lubos Kohoutek discovered the
comet by accident while searching for
new asteroids. On this, its first trip
around the sun, it has two tails — one
of dust and one of ionized particles.
On each successive trip, it will ionize
more particles, and the dust will fall
away. With its tail aimed away from
the sun, it resembles a giant
exclamation point in the sky.
Even though Kohoutek has been
hard to see, it is amazing that an
object only 10 kilometers in diameter
is visible from beyond Jupiter. It was
brightest at its perihelion (the point
nearest the sun), when it was on the
other side of the sun, but it may still
be visible this week on clear nights.
From sunset until about 8:30 p.m.,
it will be above Jupiter and Venus in
the southwestern sky. Except for
those with good eyes, binoculars are
almost a necessity.

the comet. Several people had seen it
Tuesday, but even they couldn't locate
the elusive Kohoutek Thursday night.
Overbilled
Despite the efforts of prophets and
soothsayers, astronomers and
astrologers, and clever businessmen
looking for a gimmick, Kohoutek's
comet is simply not living up to its
billing as the most spectacular comet
ever to hit the skies.
In keeping with a current trend,
many people accuse astronomers of
perpetrating a hoax to win more
research grants. Putting such cynicism
aside, the question remains: where is
Kohoutek and what is it trying to
hide?
Kohoutek's reluctance to show
itself upset many theories. The
Children of God may not need their
end-of-the-world stockpiles just yet.
Those who tried to blame the energy
crisis, Watergate, rising prices or the
Super Bowl on the comet now have
little evidence for their accusations.
'Dirty Snowball'
Even the scientific "dirty
snowball" theory, which fits other
comets — including Halley's — doesn't
apply to the temperamental
Kohoutek. Astronomers used that
theory to accurately predict
Kohoutek's position in the sky, but
their predictions about its appearance
were way off.
Scientists speculated that comet
tails were made of ice covered with
dust which reflects the sunlight; thus
the "dirty snowball." According to
that theory, Kohoutek would have
been brighter than the moon. Instead,
at its brightest, it was only of the third
magnitude, and the human eye can
only see to the fifth magnitude. In
urban areas, smog reflects city lights
onto the sky, making it very difficult
to see the comet without binoculars.
Comets baffle astronomers in many

ways. One similar to Kohoutek was
discovered in 1948, but when it passed
behind the sun, it disintegrated. If
scientists can determine the
composition of the comet head, they
say they may be able to solve such
puzzles.
Laboratory
Kohoutek has served as a
laboratory for astronomers, who for
the first time are using spectroscopy to
find out just what's in a comet. Some
scientists believe that comets may be
cosmological fossils, unchanged for
five billion years. If so, they may
provide clues to the origin of the sun.
Researchers from Stanford to Skylab
have already made some exciting
discoveries.
Methyl cyanide and hydrogen
cyanide are molecules usually found in
gas clouds, explains Nick Suntzeff of
the Stanford Observatory. But they
have been found in Kohoutek's tail,
and may account for some of the
differences between Halley and
Kohoutek.
Dr. Lubos Kohoutek discovered the
comet by accident while searching for
new asteroids. On this, its first trip
around the sun, it has two tails — one
of dust and one of ionized particles.
On each successive trip, it will ionize
more particles, and the dust will fall
away. With its tail aimed away from
the sun, it resembles a giant
exclamation point in the sky.

and may account for some of the
differences between Halley and
Kohoutek.
Dr. Lubos Kohoutek discovered the
comet by accident while searching for
new asteroids. On this, its first trip
around the sun, it has two tails — one
of dust and one of ionized particles.
On each successive trip, it will ionize
more particles, and the dust will fall
away. With its tail aimed away from
the sun, it resembles a giant
exclamation point in the sky.
Even though Kohoutek has been
hard to see, it is amazing that an
object only 10 kilometers in diameter
is visible from beyond Jupiter. It was
brightest at its perihelion (the point
nearest the sun), when it was on the
other side of the sun, but it may still
be visible this week on clear nights.
From sunset until about 8:30 p.m.,
it will be above Jupiter and Venus in
the southwestern sky. Except for
those with good eyes, binoculars are
almost a necessity.
About 150 people showed up
for "the once in a million years
treat" Thursday night at the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Standing in front of Purity
Market, squinting towards Venus
and Jupiter, the amateur
sky-watchers searched vainly for
the fizzling-sizzling Comet
Kohoutek.
It should have been one of the
best nights to see Kohoutek, but
the weather was uncooperative.
Clouds of fog obscured the
southwestern sky, and the already

dim comet escaped even the
largest telescopes brought out for
the occasion.

the comet. Several people had seen it
Tuesday, but even they couldn't locate
the elusive Kohoutek Thursday night.
Overbilled
Despite the efforts of prophets and
soothsayers, astronomers and
astrologers, and clever businessmen
looking for a gimmick, Kohoutek's
comet is simply not living up to its
billing as the most spectacular comet
ever to hit the skies.
In keeping with a current trend,
many people accuse astronomers of
perpetrating a hoax to win more
research grants. Putting such cynicism
aside, the question remains: where is
Kohoutek and what is it trying to
hide?
Kohoutek's reluctance to show
itself upset many theories. The
Children of God may not need their
end-of-the-world stockpiles just yet.
Those who tried to blame the energy
crisis, Watergate, rising prices or the
Super Bowl on the comet now have
little evidence for their accusations.
'Dirty Snowball'
Even the scientific "dirty
snowball" theory, which fits other
comets — including Halley's — doesn't
apply to the temperamental
Kohoutek. Astronomers used that
theory to accurately predict
Kohoutek's position in the sky, but
their predictions about its appearance
were way off.
Scientists speculated that comet
tails were made of ice covered with
dust which reflects the sunlight; thus
the "dirty snowball." According to
that theory, Kohoutek would have
been brighter than the moon. Instead,
at its brightest, it was only of the third
magnitude, and the human eye can
only see to the fifth magnitude. In
urban areas, smog reflects city lights
onto the sky, making it very difficult
to see the comet without binoculars.
Comets baffle astronomers in many

ways. One similar to Kohoutek was
discovered in 1948, but when it passed
behind the sun, it disintegrated. If
scientists can determine the
composition of the comet head, they
say they may be able to solve such
puzzles.
Laboratory
Kohoutek has served as a
laboratory for astronomers, who for
the first time are using spectroscopy to
find out just what's in a comet. Some
scientists believe that comets may be
cosmological fossils, unchanged for
five billion years. If so, they may
provide clues to the origin of the sun.
Researchers from Stanford to Skylab
have already made some exciting
discoveries.
Methyl cyanide and hydrogen
cyanide are molecules usually found in
gas clouds, explains Nick Suntzeff of
the Stanford Observatory. But they
have been found in Kohoutek's tail,
and may account for some of the
differences between Halley and
Kohoutek.
