# Response To Brody's Critique
## Editors Interpret 'The Other Stanford' 
### 
Appel, Peterson 9 Schoenau

(This is the first part of a response
to Prof. Brody's review of the
publication, The Other Stanford,
printed on this page at the end of fall
quarter.)
Prof. Brody's carefully written
critique of The Other Stanford is
welcome. His response is evidence that
the report has succeeded in sparking
renewed debate about undergraduate
education at Stanford.
We believe that some of Prof.
Brody's concerns are well founded;
however, we also believe that most of
his criticisms are based on a
mis-reading of the scope and contents
of the report. The crucial difficulty in
Prof. Brody's analysis arises from his
reconstruction of our argument. We
believe it strays too far from the actual
structure found in the report to be a
totally accurate representation.
Therefore, let us restate our argument
briefly once more:
I. In spite of satisfaction in several
important areas, Stanford
undergraduate students are dissatisfied
with student-faculty relations.
11. This dissatisfaction is positively
correlated with three types of
stu d en t-faculty interaction
("academic," "social," and
"personal").
111. These low interaction patterns
are moderately to strongly correlated
with four important outcomes of the
educational process, the incidence of
which among undergraduates is low.
IV. To increase the occurrence of
these four outcomes, the level of
student-faculty interaction should be
increased.

V. Student-faculty interaction can
be increased if four factors of the
Stanford environment are altered.
Thus, Prof. Brody misstates our
argument when he elevates our brief
discussion of "critical thinking" to be
the major premise of our report. This
phrase is used only twice in the
fifty-six pages of text. The major
premise of our report is that the four
outcomes of the educational process
(i.e., professors critiquing papers,
stimulating ideas outside of class,
challenging students to think on a
one-to-one basis, and having
intellectual impact on students) were
desirable.
Misunderstanding
This misunderstanding is the basis
of Prof. Brody's statement that "when
the data ran out. .. premises are
transposed to become conclusions."
This would have been true if the
report claimed that critical thinking
would necessarily occur if the four
outcomes were realized. But the report
makes no such claim.
The report simply stated that we
"doubted" that the faculty could
encourage "critical thinking" if it did
not occasionally extensively critique
student work, stimulate ideas beyond
the subject matter of classes, challenge
students to think on a one-to-one
basis, and have intellectual impact on
students. We made no attempt to
operationalize critical thinking; rather,
we indicated four outcomes of the
educational process that we thought
necessary, though possibly n<Dt
sufficient, if the faculty is to play a
role in the stimulation of critical

thinking among students.
Prof. Brody may well disagree with
this assertion, but it is by no means
central to the report. What is central
to our report, however, is the assertion
that the four outcomes are desirable.
As stated in his review, Prof. Brody
agrees with this assertion.
Given the inaccurate reconstruction
of the report's argument, the following
points made by Prof. Brody are moot:
no data are provided showing the
relationship between critical thinking
and the four outcomes, and no
comparisons are made between critical
thinking and different "interaction
settings."
Five Measures
Also, as a direct result of the way in
which Prof. Brody reconstructs our
argument, the purpose of our
discussion of satisfaction escapes him.
We used five measures of satisfaction
as diagnostic devices to determine how
students regarded various aspects of
their undergraduate experience. We
found that, in sharp contrast to other
indices, students were dissatisfied with
the quality of student-faculty relations
and the advising system. Because of
this contrast, we decided to examine
these two areas in the report a
four-page discussion (not 15) of
satisfaction only to demonstrate to the
reader that students were dissatisfied
with these two aspects and to explain
why we focused the remainder of the
report on them.
Prof. Brody states that "it cannot
be the case that the demonstrated low
level of academic and personal
interaction is 'inadequate' to promote
student satisfaction with their
education because the level of
satisfaction is quite high." This
statement is inaccurate, for while 63
and 61 percent of the students
surveyed expressed satisfaction with
the quality of the intellectual
environment and instruction, only 28
and 31 percent expressed satisfaction
with student-faculty relations and the
advising system. Thus, the level of
satisfaction is "quite high" in two
areas, but it is "quite low" in two
others, i.e., precisely those areas upon
which the analysis in the report is
focused.
In closing his discussion about
satisfaction, Prof. Brody suggests that
reliance on it alone may be insufficient
grounds for policy-making. In this we
agree with Prof. Brody but wish to
note that our report and its policy
recommendations do not rest on
satisfaction and its relationship with

interaction but rather on the four
educational outcomes and their strong
relationship with interaction. Prof.
Brody agrees with us on the strength
of this relationship when he writes
"the data are clear, the interpretations
are sound, and the message is
unmistakable . .
