No Need For A Counter-Culture
Editor:
In regard to your statement of
opinion, "Where is Stanford
Counter-Culture Now?", it is where
panty raids are — and deservedly so.
In your "Amerika" this little
editorial of disorganization and non
sequiturs can go unnoticed, even by
your student body.
In a real fascist state at this
moment you are about to see how a
dissident writer is going to be treated.
Mind you, it will occur in a communist
wonderland where all is flowers and
people "reach out" for each other (by
the throat) and "integrate" (deport
the Jews who are lucky).
I have never understood how you
would explain the difficulties you
would run into philosophically by so
dehumanizing every member of a
profession as to call them all "pigs,"
but I for one would like to see the
Palo Alto Police withdraw their
"oppressive" services for 48 hours,
with advance notice, to allow your
editorial staff the "sense of
community" and taste of reality that
the vicious of the world would treat
you to.
I have never seen a letter of this
sort in The Stanford Daily, and I'll bet
you won't publish this. My experience
with Messianic types is that though
they are often mistaken, they are
never in doubt. Just thought I'd give
you this opportunity for a truly liberal
outlook. At another time in another
culture medium, you are the kind that
the Brown shirts were made of.
