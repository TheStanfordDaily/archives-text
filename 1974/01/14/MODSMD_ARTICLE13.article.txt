# Over Holiday Break
## Thefts Increase Slightly 
### DENIS CUFF 
Only two more thefts occurred
in or near student residences this
Christmas break than last, despite
the fact that many students
remaining on campus were
quartered in rooms of other
students on vacation.
Some students whose rooms
were occupied by strangers
expressed fear of thefts, but,
according to police files, there
were no thefts in any of the
rooms where 192 students were
temporarily relocated.
Of the 14 thefts that students
reported: four involved ski
equipment stolen from storage
lockers in Abrams and Hoskins;
10 involved bicycles stolen near
student residences and academic
buildings.
During the 1972 break, there
were 12 thefts reported, most of
them bicycles.
For 1973, students had more

bicycles stolen than any other
item, files showed. Some 568
bicycles valued at $46,704 were
stolen in the Stanford area, 40
more bikes and $2000 more than
in 1972.
"They know what they want
when they steal bicycles ... 10-
speeds," Officer Jack Donals of
the Police Services Department
said. He cited last Christmas break
as an example; seven of the 10
bikes stolen were 10-speeds.
Details for the recovery rate of
bikes and other stolen articles
were not available.
Burglaries for the Stanford area
were down from 495 in 1972 to
332 in 1973, but this figure
doesn't necessarily indicate a
downward trend in crime. They
explained that a different system
of reporting burglaries accounted
for most of the drop in the figure,
also influenced by an increase in
patrolling and a decrease in

"outsiders" on campus
accompanying the decrease in
student demonstrations.
Officials said they expect the
reported burglary rate to rise next
year because of the switch to the
new method of reporting them.
They declined to give specifics but
said the method will give a more
accurate picture of how many
burglaries take place.
Other figures that showed
decreases from 1972 to 1973
were: auto thefts, 63 (with 17
recoveries) to 41 (with 14
recoveries); robberies down from
12 to 9; petty thefts down from
1048 to 1020.
