# Ruggers Defeat St. Mary's
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
While most of the attention of
Stanford sports fans was focused
on Pauley Pavilion, Stanford's
rugby team traveled to tiny
Moraga Saturday. The Cards
defeated St. Mary's 14-0 on a field
which resembled the marsh land
around San Francisco Bay.
"This wasn't really a big win,
but it was important because it
gave me a chance to look at all the
players in a game situation," said

Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic.
"Larry Lieberman really
impressed me. He scored two tries
on great plays."
The Cards took control from
the start, dominating the scrum.
"I didn't really expect it to be a
high scoring game because the
field wasn't in great shape," said
Kmetovic.
Jack Schultz returned to rubgv
action by scoring on a long try.

The Cards' kicking game was also
good, with Marty Odonohue
scoring one conversion for the
Cards. Prop Chuck Corder played
an outstanding game and John
Snider's play also impressed
Kmetovic.
Kmetovic has been searching
for a fullback and he may have
found one in Eric Test. Although
bothered by a sprained wrist, Test
played an "outstanding game."
On the first try, Craig Zaltosky
started out with a nice
breakthrough run and then passed
to Schultz for the score. "Craig
played a fine game for us,"
Kmetovic said. "He seemed to be
a bit tight, but he hasn't practiced
with the team that much.
"Reese Milner did a good job
hooking for us," Kmetovic
continued. "I was really pleased
with the game. We have only
practiced a week so we'll have to
play ourselves into shape. Looking
ahead to March, it looks like we'll
have a pretty good shot at the
Monterey Nationals."
Stanford's second team
defeated St. Mary's 10-0.
Reynaud Moore scored both tries
for the B's. "Reynaud looked real
good. He wasn't able to get in a
lot of practice time, but I think
he'll probably move up to the
varsity before too long," said
Kmetovic. "He has had a lot of
experience, playing rugby for
UCLA and the Santa Monica
Rugby Club," Kmetovic added.
He also praised Jack Green and Ed
Snowden.
The Cards face the San
Francisco Rugby Club next
Saturday at Stanford.

started out with a nice
breakthrough run and then passed
to Schultz for the score. "Craig
played a fine game for us,"
Kmetovic said. "He seemed to be
a bit tight, but he hasn't practiced
with the team that much.
"Reese Milner did a good job
hooking for us," Kmetovic
continued. "I was really pleased
with the game. We have only
practiced a week so we'll have to
play ourselves into shape. Looking
ahead to March, it looks like we'll
have a pretty good shot at the
Monterey Nationals."
Stanford's second team
defeated St. Mary's 10-0.
Reynaud Moore scored both tries
for the B's. "Reynaud looked real
good. He wasn't able to get in a
lot of practice time, but I think
he'll probably move up to the
varsity before too long," said
Kmetovic. "He has had a lot of
experience, playing rugby for
UCLA and the Santa Monica
Rugby Club," Kmetovic added.
He also praised Jack Green and Ed
Snowden.
The Cards face the San
Francisco Rugby Club next
Saturday at Stanford.

MOROSKI FOR TWO — Sophomore Marty Moroski, a
"never-say-die-guy" according to varsity star Rich Kelley, scores two
points in the Junior Varsity's double-overtime loss to Menlo. The
addition of Moroski to the JV's has added a welcome scoring punch to
Billy Jopes' 3-3 team.
While most of the attention of
Stanford sports fans was focused
on Pauley Pavilion, Stanford's
rugby team traveled to tiny
Moraga Saturday. The Cards
defeated St. Mary's 14-0 on a field
which resembled the marsh land
around San Francisco Bay.
"This wasn't really a big win,
but it was important because it
gave me a chance to look at all the
players in a game situation," said

Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic.
"Larry Lieberman really
impressed me. He scored two tries
on great plays."
The Cards took control from
the start, dominating the scrum.
"I didn't really expect it to be a
high scoring game because the
field wasn't in great shape," said
Kmetovic.
Jack Schultz returned to rubgv
action by scoring on a long try.

The Cards' kicking game was also
good, with Marty Odonohue
scoring one conversion for the
Cards. Prop Chuck Corder played
an outstanding game and John
Snider's play also impressed
Kmetovic.
Kmetovic has been searching
for a fullback and he may have
found one in Eric Test. Although
bothered by a sprained wrist, Test
played an "outstanding game."
On the first try, Craig Zaltosky
started out with a nice
breakthrough run and then passed
to Schultz for the score. "Craig
played a fine game for us,"
Kmetovic said. "He seemed to be
a bit tight, but he hasn't practiced
with the team that much.
