# Moroski Sparks Third JV Victory
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Led by sophomore Marty
Moroski's finest performance of
the season, the Stanford junior
varsity cagers Friday rallied for a
73-70 come-from-behind win over
the University of the Pacific JV at
Stockton.
Moroski scored 18 points, and
made six of seven field goals in
the first half, keeping Stanford in
the game after it had fallen
behind, 12-2.
"We got blown out at the
beginning and made a great
comeback," said acting head
coach Bob Buell, who recorded
his second win of the season while
filling in for Billy Jones. Jones
was in Los Angeles with the
varsity.
Another key to the Card
victory was Stanford's free throw
shooting, which at one time was
23 of 27. The Cardinals ran up a
seven-point lead late in the game
after trailing by two at the half,
but then, according to Buell, "our
free-throw shooting deserted us.
We missed on four straight
one-and-ones."
'Won At The Line'
Still, Stanford finished with a
.742 free-throw percentage,
prompting Buell to say, "We won
it at the line."
Buell admitted that his team
was "a little tired" in the first
half, but "we settled down. We
called a time out and got in gear."
Stanford's transmission proved
in order, and the Cards built a

solid lead in the second half. Only
the missed foul shots allowed
Pacific to narrow the gap.
"We were out-rebounded —
again," Buell said, referring to
Pacific's 44-28 advantage on the
boards, and Stanford's perpetual
weakness in that facet of the
game.
Session Stars
Making up for a dearth of
caroms was the second half
ball-handling of reserve Warner
Session. He recorded six
recoveries in the second half, and
his numerous steals rattled Pacific.
Session also scored 11 points, his
season high.
Stanford connected on 51
percent of its shots, while the
Tigers could manage only 42
percent.
The win gave the JV a 3-3
record for the season. Stanford
will travel to Oakland Tuesday for
an 8 p.m. meeting with Merritt
College. Buell says of Merritt's
cagers, "They're always running,
they're quick, and they're good
jumpers."

the season, the Stanford junior
varsity cagers Friday rallied for a
73-70 come-from-behind win over
the University of the Pacific JV at
Stockton.
Moroski scored 18 points, and
made six of seven field goals in
the first half, keeping Stanford in
the game after it had fallen
behind, 12-2.
"We got blown out at the
beginning and made a great
comeback," said acting head
coach Bob Buell, who recorded
his second win of the season while
filling in for Billy Jones. Jones
was in Los Angeles with the
varsity.
Another key to the Card
victory was Stanford's free throw
shooting, which at one time was
23 of 27. The Cardinals ran up a
seven-point lead late in the game
after trailing by two at the half,
but then, according to Buell, "our
free-throw shooting deserted us.
We missed on four straight
one-and-ones."
'Won At The Line'
Still, Stanford finished with a
.742 free-throw percentage,
prompting Buell to say, "We won
it at the line."
Buell admitted that his team
was "a little tired" in the first
half, but "we settled down. We
called a time out and got in gear."
Stanford's transmission proved
in order, and the Cards built a

solid lead in the second half. Only
the missed foul shots allowed
Pacific to narrow the gap.
"We were out-rebounded —
again," Buell said, referring to
Pacific's 44-28 advantage on the
boards, and Stanford's perpetual
weakness in that facet of the
game.
Session Stars
Making up for a dearth of
caroms was the second half
ball-handling of reserve Warner
Session. He recorded six
recoveries in the second half, and
his numerous steals rattled Pacific.
Session also scored 11 points, his
season high.
Stanford connected on 51
percent of its shots, while the
Tigers could manage only 42
percent.
The win gave the JV a 3-3
record for the season. Stanford
will travel to Oakland Tuesday for
an 8 p.m. meeting with Merritt
College. Buell says of Merritt's
cagers, "They're always running,
they're quick, and they're good
jumpers."
