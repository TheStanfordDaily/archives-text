# Class Seeks Alternative Energy Sources

A hundred pairs of eyes stare
intently at the table of figures,
projected on a screen at the front of
the darkened room. They watch
attentively as the guest lecturer
gestures toward the screen with a long
stick.
"Geothermal energy is down
there ... somewhere," he says."The
problem is getting it out."
The class is Engineering 235,
"Alternatives to the Petroleum
Economy." The speaker is Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Thomas Connolly.
The audience is a group of Stanford
students and faculty who will, over the
next two quarters, grapple with a
dilemma which everyone recognizes
but no one can solve â€” the energy
crisis.
The study group is concerned with
the inevitable depletion of fossil fuels:
oil, coal and natural gas.
Non-Depletable Energy
When these fuels are used up, the
United States faces disaster unless new
energy sources are found and tapped.
This group is seeking ways to harness
non-depletable energy sources, such as
solar and geothermal energy, and
convert them into power which can
run the economy.
A detailed report of the project will
be published in the summer and sent
to scientists, government agencies and

political leaders. Prof. William
Reynolds, chairman of the Mechanical
Engineering Department and one of
the organizers of the project, hopes
that the recommendations in the
report will influence private and
government research, diverting more
energy and money into non-fossil fuel
studies and development.
The project may also have an effect
on research at Stanford. "What we
expect to happen here is that we'll
turn a lot of faculty on to some
interesting problems and they'll then
go out individually to get research
support to deal with smaller
subphases," Reynolds said.
Alternative Sources
In the course of the study, a large
spectrum of alternative energy
possibilities will be narrowed down to
concentrate on one or two which are
most feasible.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lucignan, director of the project, said,
"The area which will probably take
the most man-hours will be
solar-agricultural energy processes."
"Other preliminary studies have
looked good," he said. "It appears that
total energy needs could be met if 15
to 30 percent of our farmlands were
converted to a single energy crop, such
as sugar beets."
Sugar beets and some other crops
yield especially high amounts of

energy when they are burned as a
substitute for coal or converted into
liquid form, such as methanol alcohol.
Engineering 235 bears little
resemblance to a conventional,
academic class. Reynolds pointed out,
"The lectures are just useful
background. The real learning comes
in the process of independently
digging out something and reporting it
to the student group."
To handle all the research and
analysis, the 85 students and 15
faculty members are divided into five
groups. Each group will tackle a
different aspect of the energy
problem, ranging from the
development of energy sources to the
legal and political angles of
implementing the study's
recommendations.

The class includes graduates and
seniors with relevant experience in
disciplines ranging from chemistry and
electrical engineering to law and
business. This diversity is necessary
because the study is investigating all
aspects of energy from the technology
of exploiting new sources to the
effects of different alternatives on the
economy.
The study is divided into three
phases. The first phase consists of the
guest speaker program and
information gathering by the students.
In the second part, the class will
evaluate and compare the different
energy alternatives and decide upon
the specific recommendations of the
study.
The final phase is the actual
write-up of the findings.
