## League Games Easy For Unbeaten Ducks 
### 
The Oregon Ducks, chastised a
few weeks ago for playing a
"patsy" non-league schedule, have
shown those skeptics that winning
Pacific Eight games is easier than
beating teams like Montana State,
UC-Davis and Puget Sound.
The Ducks, who swept a league
series in the Bay Area last
weekend, swept another one this
weekend, defeating Washington
State and Washington before
boisterous crowds at Mac Arthur
Court. Friday night Oregon
opened up a 14-point halftime
lead and coasted home for a 69-54
victory over the Cougars. Ron Lee
led the Ducks with 18 points, a
figure matched by WSU frosh
sensation Steve Puidokas.
Saturday the going was tougher

but the result the same. Oregon
trailed winless Washington by 12
points with 12 minutes remaining,
but stormed back for a 90-88
victory. Lee poured in 26 points
and Gerald Willett added 19, but
Washington's Larry Pounds
grabbed game honors with 27
points.
Oregon State and Washington
State were each 1-1 for the second
straight weekend. OSU rolled over
Washington 87-63 Friday night in
Corvallis as six Beavers scored in
double figures. Saturday night,
Washington State rallied in the
final 1:42 to oust the Beavers,
72-69. The Cougars converted
9-10 free throws during that
period.
Puidokas topped all scorers
with 26 points.
California had even worse luck
than Stanford in Los Angeles.
Friday the Bears absorbed a 92-56
thrashing at Pauley Pavilion as
Keith Wilkes led the Bruins with
24 points.
Saturday Cal trailed USC by
only one point with 11 minutes
left, but Biff Burrell came off the
bench and sparked a three-minute
11-2 Trojan spurt. USC eventually
recorded a 76-61 victory, but
Cal's Rickie Hawthorne led the
scoring with 22 points.
All Pac-8 teams play
non-league games next weekend,
highlighted by UCLA's showdown
with Notre Dame at South Bend.
At least one Bruin, though, is
downplaying next week's action.
"Notre Dame is a non-conference
game," said Tommy Curtis, "and
we treat all non-conference games
with the same unimportance."

BEST IN THE WEST — At least for a week or two, as Bill Walton
recovers from a back injury, Stanford's Rich Kelley is the number one
center on the West Coast. Saturday Kelley scored 26 points against
the Bruins, including this short jumper over Rich Washington. Keith
Wilkes looks on.
