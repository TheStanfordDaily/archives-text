# Vocal Crowds At Maples
## Wrestlers Win One Of Three Meets 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Maybe, just maybe, collegiate wrestling
has caught on on the West Coast. Saturday
night a large vocal turnout saw UCLA and
Cornell top Stanford in a triangular meet.
Friday, the Cards found the pot of gold at
the end of the Hawaii Rainbows and cashed
in for a 36-9 triumph, before a moderate
gathering in Maples Pavilion.
The Saturday crowd seemed evenly
divided between backers of the three schools.
Stanford Coach Joe De Meo had sent
invitations to all Cornell Alumni residing in
Northern California, and a considerable
number showed up to root for their alma
mater.
The eastern school is also UCLA Coach
Dave Auble's and De Meo's alma mater,
adding significarce to the meet.
Stanford turned in a good performance
against the tough Bruin grapplers, rated
second in the state. With their wrestling
budget "they should be ten times as good as
us and they aren't," commented De Meo.
Only three times.
There were a few bright point in the

33-11 loss. Jim Tatarakis (126), who had
earlier been pinned by his Cornell opponent,
pinned the Bruins' Steve Pitcher, the only fall
of the evening against UCLA.
Comeback Victory
Roy Tolles (190) excited Card rooters
with a 6-5 comeback victory and Marc Frelier
worked for a 3-3 tie to complete Stanford's
scoring.
The heavyweight contest between
freshmen Gary Anderson and UCLA's Jerry
Bishop, a rematch of last year's state high
school finals (Anderson won), proved as
exciting as De Meo predicted, while it lasted.
Anderson scored a takedown in the last
seven seconds of the first period to lead 2-0.
Bishop escaped early in the second round,
then took down Anderson to lead 3-2. But
while on the bottom, Anderson injured his
leg and was forced to forfeit the match.
The Cards fared better against Cornell,
and with a few breaks could have turned
around the 26-16 score.
Decision Wins
Charlie Masch (150) and Gary
Manglesdorf (134) decisioned their

opponents. Mark Yancey (142) scored an
impressive pin during the second round and
Jeff Richardson (167) dominated his man for
a superior decision. t*
UCLA and Cornell ateo faced each other
Saturday, with the Bruirls victorious, 23-11.
The Hawaii match was one-sided from the
start. After forfeiting the 118-pound class,
the Cards only lost once. Tatarakis came
from behind with two near falls in the last
period for a 7-6 win. After Manglesdorf lost,
Yancey pinned his opponent after building
up a 14-6 lead.
Masch, Craig Reynolds (158), and
Richardson each won by decision to put the
Cards comfortably ahead, 18-9. The three
remaining matches were all Stanford pins.
Frelier topped his man in just over 35
seconds of the first period. Kris Westersund
(190) held a commanding 12-1 lead before
his second period win, and Anderson beat the
Hawaii heavyweight in the third round.
Tomorrow, the Cards travel to San Luis
Obispo to take on Cal Poly, the top team in
the state.
