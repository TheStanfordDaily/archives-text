# Cards Still Winless In Conference
## Trojans Capitalize On Cardinal Breakdown 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
LOS ANGELES — It was an
appropriate ending to another one
of those frustrating Stanford
basketball games. Ed Schweitzer
missed a layup with about five
seconds left, grabbed the rebound
and put it up again. It rolled
around the rim, hit the
backboard, rolled the rim again.
The buzzer sounded. The ball fell
to the floor.
The missed basket didn't affect
the final outcome, but it was
frustrating nonetheless. And so it
goes for Stanford's Cardinals, who
seem to play any team of any
calibre close — only to lose in the
waning moments.
Last week against Oregon and
Oregon State, turnovers were to
blame. Last month against
Kentucky, it was the referees.
Friday night at the Sports Arena,
it was a combination of the two.
The Cards committed 27
miscues, but still might have
defeated the 17th ranked Trojans
if it weren't for some amazing
officiating. Both teams scored 24
field goals, but the Trojans
stepped to the line 28 times,
compared to only 13 for the
Cardinals.
USC connected on 16 of those
charity tosses, which accounted
for its 64-57 victory.
The free throw totals were
especially amazing since Stanford
played a collapsing zone defense
most of the game while USC
pressured the Cards with an
aggressive man to man. The
Trojan defense caused turnovers,
as expected, but didn't cause
fouls, which was very unexpected.
'Lost Control'
Still, Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar refused to blame the
referees. "We just had a
four-minute breakdown when we
built up a lead," he said in the
subdued Cardinal locker room.
"We were in control and lost it —
that's all."
Stanford had stretched a 34-32
halftime lead to 43-35 with 15:43
remaining and seemed on the
verge of blowing the Trojans right
out of the sparsely populated
Sports Arena. But USC gradually
closed the gap, and eventually
exploded with about seven
minutes left.
John Lambert gave USC its
first lead of the second half on a
layup with 6:58 remaining, and
then Biff Burrell scored five
points in the next
minute-and-a-half to put the Cards
six points back. Three of those
points were free throws, one
following a technical foul on
Melvin Arterberry.
Two clutch buckets by Rich
Kelley narrowed the gap to two
points, but the Cardinal rally was
short-lived. USC outscored the
Cards 9-2 in the final minutes to
insure the victory.
"We didn't panic," said Trojan
forward Clint Chapman, who

helped bury the Cards with 22
points and eight rebounds. "Poise
won it in the end."
USC coach Bob Boyd agreed.
"We seemed to rush everything in
the first half," he said, "but we
took our time toward the finish
and played OK."
In the opening period,
Stanford employed a delay game
much of the time and scored
repeatedly on backdoor passes
from Kelley to his streaking
teammates. But in the second
half, the delay offense was
ineffective.
"In the first half we tried to
pressure the leads anhgot burned
on the backdoor," Biyd said. "In
the second half we layed off
everyone else and just pressured
Kelley — he's the key to that
offense.
"From what I can gather,"
Boyd continued, "Stanford
played a lot tougher than they did
last week. I thought we beat a fine
team."
The starting Cardinal front line
of Kelley, Schweitzer and Dave
Frost was particularly impressive,
combining for 41 points and 23
rebounds.

on hand were treated to a spirited

USJUMB in style and attire, but
the consensus, at least in the
opinion of a handful of Stanford
fans, was that the Incomparables
won again.

USC coach Bob Boyd agreed.
"We seemed to rush everything in

In the opening period,
Stanford employed a delay game
much of the time and scored
repeatedly on backdoor passes
from Kelley to his streaking
teammates. But in the second

ineffective.
"In the first half we tried to

last week. I thought we beat a fine

The starting Cardinal front line
of Kelley, Schweitzer and Dave

Cardinal Notes: The 5157 fans
on hand were treated to a spirited
"Battle of the Bands." USC's
Trojan Band parodied the
USJUMB in style and attire, but

fans, was that the Incomparables
won again.

LOS ANGELES — It was an
appropriate ending to another one
of those frustrating Stanford
basketball games. Ed Schweitzer
missed a layup with about five
seconds left, grabbed the rebound
and put it up again. It rolled
around the rim, hit the
backboard, rolled the rim again.
The buzzer sounded. The ball fell
to the floor.
The missed basket didn't affect
the final outcome, but it was
frustrating nonetheless. And so it
goes for Stanford's Cardinals, who
seem to play any team of any
calibre close — only to lose in the
waning moments.
Last week against Oregon and
Oregon State, turnovers were to
blame. Last month against
Kentucky, it was the referees.
Friday night at the Sports Arena,
it was a combination of the two.
The Cards committed 27
miscues, but still might have
defeated the 17th ranked Trojans
if it weren't for some amazing
officiating. Both teams scored 24
field goals, but the Trojans
stepped to the line 28 times,
compared to only 13 for the
Cardinals.
USC connected on 16 of those
charity tosses, which accounted
for its 64-57 victory.
The free throw totals were
especially amazing since Stanford
played a collapsing zone defense
most of the game while USC
pressured the Cards with an
aggressive man to man. The
Trojan defense caused turnovers,
as expected, but didn't cause
fouls, which was very unexpected.
'Lost Control'
Still, Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar refused to blame the
referees. "We just had a
four-minute breakdown when we
built up a lead," he said in the
subdued Cardinal locker room.
"We were in control and lost it —
that's all."
Stanford had stretched a 34-32
halftime lead to 43-35 with 15:43
remaining and seemed on the
verge of blowing the Trojans right
out of the sparsely populated
Sports Arena. But USC gradually
closed the gap, and eventually
exploded with about seven
minutes left.
John Lambert gave USC its
first lead of the second half on a
layup with 6:58 remaining, and
then Biff Burrell scored five
points in the next
minute-and-a-half to put the Cards
six points back. Three of those
points were free throws, one
following a technical foul on
Melvin Arterberry.
Two clutch buckets by Rich
Kelley narrowed the gap to two
points, but the Cardinal rally was
short-lived. USC outscored the
Cards 9-2 in the final minutes to
insure the victory.
"We didn't panic," said Trojan
forward Clint Chapman, who

helped bury the Cards with 22
points and eight rebounds. "Poise
won it in the end."
