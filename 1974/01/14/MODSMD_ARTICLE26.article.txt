# Solid Stanford Effort Scares Mighty Bruins
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
LOS ANGELES - About five
minutes into Saturday's
Stanford-UCLA game, John
Wooden sat pensively on the
bench, his program rolled up and
pressed to his mouth. He figdeted
with his glasses as Rich Kelley
scored on a reverse layup. He
nervously winced when Kelley
sank a free throw. He slapped his
wrist with the program when Ed
Schweitzer sank a turnaround
jumper.
There was 14:56 remaining in
the first half and Stanford led
11-6. Wooden was upset, maybe
even scared.
It didn't take long, though, for
the 25-year Bruin coach to relax.
Keith Wilkes tipped in a rebound,
Pete Trgovich scored on a short
jumper, Dave Meyers banked in a
13-footer. The score was tied.
Five minutes later the Bruins
parlayed four consecutive
Cardinal turnovers into a 10-2
scoring spree. From then on it was
no contest, as UCLA coasted to
its 87th straight victory, a 66-52
decision over Stanford's
disappointed Cardinals.
For you numbers freaks and
sadists, it was the Bruins' 47th
straight conference victory, 58th
straight at Pauley Pavilion and
16th straight over Stanford.
The Cards, adding another
game to their own streak — Pac-8
losses — are now 0-4 in the league
and 5-7 overall.
'Played Us Well'
"Stanford played us well,"
Wooden said afterward, "but I
was very pleased with our play.
We played tough defense, and as I
told my players before the game,

champions win on defense ... We
had patience and when we got
behind early in the game, we
didn't rush things."
UCLA played without
two-time NCAA player-of-the
year Bill Walton, but the big
redhead wasn't missed. "With Bill
out, Keith [Wilkes] and I feel an
extra responsibility," said guard
Tommy Curtis. "We feel we have
to do certain things."
For Curtis, one of those things
was assuming floor leadership,
shouting instructions and
controlling the tempo of the game
as he dribbled around and through
the Card defense.
For Wilkes, it was a quieter
type of leadership. He sank 8-14
field goal attempts, 5-6 free
throws and led UCLA in
rebounding with nine caroms. It
was effortless, but devastating.
"He's amazing — just a super
player," said Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar. "He's so solid in
every aspect of the game —
passing, shooting, defense. He's
smart, he anticipates. He's
outstanding."
Foul Trouble
Enough for the superlatives.
Wilkes was simply the difference
in a game that might have been
very close if Kelley hadn't gotten
into early foul trouble. He picked
up his third foul in the first half
and was charged with number
four after only two-and-a-half
minutes of the second period.
Amazingly, he played the
remainder of the game, but he was
unable to dominate defensively.
"Obviously, Rich had to be
careful," Dallmar said. "When he
got his third and fourth fouls he
was walking on eggs. He just
couldn't be aggressive and block
shots."
Offensively, though, Kelley's
performance was brilliant. He was
the game's top scorer with 26
points, in addition to leading all
rebounders with 11.
"He was tough," said freshman
Richard Washington, who along
with sohpomore Ralph Drollinger
played creditably at center in
Walton's absence. "I
underestimated him at first, but
he gave us trouble."
Were you at all worried in the
first half?
"I was confident all through
the game," Washington 'said. "I
knew something had to break."
For UCLA, it always does.

Cardinal Notes: Tim Patterson,
playing in the same pavilion where
his brother Steve starred for two
UCLA national champions,
converted 5-6 field goals and 2-3
free throws for 12
points .... Melvin Arterberry
played an aggressive floor game
and was second only to Kelley in
rebounding (seven) .... The game
was marred by seven TV
timeouts.
