# Swimmers Storm Past Favored Huskies
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
In a performance that can only
be described as magnificent, the
Stanford Cardinals upset the
University of Washington Huskies
at the Stanford Swim Stadium
Saturday afternoon. The score
was 62-51, and the weather was
just as brilliant.
The Huskies, ranked fourth in
the nation, boast four Olympians,
including Rick DeMont, but they
weren't enough as the Cards threw
all they had at them in a total
team effort.
The only things that this show
lacked were the Stanford Band
and a kitchen sink. Down to the
last relay, the formidable
foursome of Dave Fairbank, Bruce

Goodwin, Martin Pedley and Dean
Anderson clinched it with a
clocking of 3:05.8, fastest in the
nation so far, leaving the Huskie
swimmers back with the tadpoles.
Pedley, the team captain said,
"This is the first time we've
planned a meet, strategy-wise, and
followed through on our plans."
There was some outside help,
however. The Huskies were
obviously hurting without the
services of sprinter Stan Carper,
missing because of eligibility
problems. But whether or not he
could have turned things around
can only be left to conjecture.
Carper's absence forced Husky
coach Eari Ellis to use Olympian
Robin Backhaus in the 100 and

200 freestyle instead of his
specialty, the 200 fly.
Resounding Win
In the first event of the day,
the 400-yard medley relay, Randy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Roux and Dean Anderson got
things rolling with a resounding
win. Once again, it was Hencken
who broke it open.
Behind by half a body length
going into his leg, Hencken passed
and built up a body length lead
over the Husky swimmer, allowing
anchorman Anderson to coast in
with the win.
Washington held the lead only
once, after sweeping the 200 free.
But the Cards came right back
with a sweep of their own in the
50. Dave Fairbank, also a winner
in the 100 and Dean Anderson,
combined for the one-two finish.
Fairbank's time of 20.7 was a new
Stanford record.
Nonchalant Victories
Hencken then did his thing,
nonchalantly winning both the
200 individual medley and the
200 breast. So what else is new?
The incredible world champion
recorded his season's best times in
both events.
Fairbank and Hencken
provided the meat of the Stanford
attack. But the key points came in
the backstroke, the diving and the
distances.
Randy Whitchurch edged Bill
Patterson, an English Olympian,
for second in the 200
breaststroke.
Sutton Surprises
Terry Sutton showed the' big
crowd on hand what he's made of,
placing second in the 1000 and
500 ahead of Olympian Doug
Northway and behind Olympian
Rick DeMont.
In the diving, freshman Wayne
Wager dazzled his way to a first in
the three-meter event over Ralf
Bjur, Pacific Eight champion for

the Huskies.
To be sure, the Huskies didn't
play dead; they had several
outstanding performances.
Fighting for its life, Washington's
effort was admirable.
But when Dean Anderson
finished the last leg of the free
relay and raised a clenched fist in
exultation, it was easy to see who
outclassed whom.

The Huskies, ranked fourth in
the nation, boast four Olympians,
including Rick DeMont, but they
weren't enough as the Cards threw
all they had at them in a total
team effort.
The only things that this show
lacked were the Stanford Band
and a kitchen sink. Down to the
last relay, the formidable
foursome of Dave Fairbank, Bruce

Goodwin, Martin Pedley and Dean
Anderson clinched it with a
clocking of 3:05.8, fastest in the
nation so far, leaving the Huskie
swimmers back with the tadpoles.
Pedley, the team captain said,
"This is the first time we've
planned a meet, strategy-wise, and
followed through on our plans."
There was some outside help,
however. The Huskies were
obviously hurting without the
services of sprinter Stan Carper,
missing because of eligibility
problems. But whether or not he
could have turned things around
can only be left to conjecture.
Carper's absence forced Husky
coach Eari Ellis to use Olympian
Robin Backhaus in the 100 and

200 freestyle instead of his
specialty, the 200 fly.
Resounding Win
In the first event of the day,
the 400-yard medley relay, Randy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Roux and Dean Anderson got
things rolling with a resounding
win. Once again, it was Hencken
who broke it open.
Behind by half a body length
going into his leg, Hencken passed
and built up a body length lead
over the Husky swimmer, allowing
anchorman Anderson to coast in
with the win.
Washington held the lead only
once, after sweeping the 200 free.
But the Cards came right back
with a sweep of their own in the
50. Dave Fairbank, also a winner
in the 100 and Dean Anderson,
combined for the one-two finish.
Fairbank's time of 20.7 was a new
Stanford record.
Nonchalant Victories
Hencken then did his thing,
nonchalantly winning both the
200 individual medley and the
200 breast. So what else is new?
The incredible world champion
recorded his season's best times in
both events.
Fairbank and Hencken
provided the meat of the Stanford
attack. But the key points came in
the backstroke, the diving and the
distances.
Randy Whitchurch edged Bill
Patterson, an English Olympian,
for second in the 200
breaststroke.
Sutton Surprises
Terry Sutton showed the' big
crowd on hand what he's made of,
placing second in the 1000 and
500 ahead of Olympian Doug
Northway and behind Olympian
Rick DeMont.
In the diving, freshman Wayne
Wager dazzled his way to a first in
the three-meter event over Ralf
Bjur, Pacific Eight champion for

the Huskies.
To be sure, the Huskies didn't
play dead; they had several
outstanding performances.
Fighting for its life, Washington's
effort was admirable.
But when Dean Anderson
finished the last leg of the free
relay and raised a clenched fist in
exultation, it was easy to see who
outclassed whom.
