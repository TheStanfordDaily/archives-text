# Breakthrough For Kissinger?
## Israel Proposes Troop Pullback 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
proposed a troop pullback plan for the
tense Suez front yesterday that
appeared to hand Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger a breakthrough in
his hectic Middle East diplomacy.
The Israelis declined to disclose the
nature of the proposal.
Kissinger emerged from a final
round of negotiations with Israeli
leaders looking exhausted, but
sounding pleased.
"I will now do my very best to
present the Israeli considerations when
I meet with President Anwar Sadat,"
he told newspersons.
Kissinger and his party flew back to
Egypt last night with the Israeli
proposal. Kissinger plans to return to
Jerusalem tonight with the Egyptian
reaction.
As Kissinger left Jerusalem, the
Israeli military command reported that

day-long skirmishes on the Syrian
front had killed one Israeli soldier. The
Syrian radio claimed 20 Israelis were
killed or wounded in what appeared to
be the most serious clashes on the
northern front in weeks.
Kissinger flew in from Jerusalem
with an outline of details for
withdrawal of the Israeli forces. There
are indications that the Egyptian
reception to Israel's offer might pose
problems.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismail
Fahmy declared yesterday that Egypt
will reject any separate or partial
Middle East peace deal with Israel.
General Lines
It is widely known that the general
lines of Israel's proposal involve Israeli
withdrawal from territory on the
western side of the Suez Canal
captured in the October war, plus
pullback 18 to 30 miles east of the

canal.
In return, the Israelis want Cairo to
remove most of its tanks, missiles and
artillery from east bank territory
captured by Egypt in the war.
Egyptian sources said Sadat
opposes withdrawing the big Egyptian
guns and wants Israel to commit itself
to further withdrawals from the Sinai
peninsula. Israel insists on carrying out
the first pullback before agreeing to
further withdrawals.
Peninsula Occupied
Israel had occupied the entire Sinai
peninsula up to the canal since the
Middle East war of 1967. But last
October's war left jagged cease-fire
lines, with Egyptian forces on the
western bank in some spots and Israeli
forces on the western bank in others.
The result has been frequent
clashes, adding to the urgency of
Kissinger's disengagement efforts
designed to separate the armies and
halt the clashes while the over-all
Geneva peace conference works on a
wider peace accord.
Israeli thinking has been that Egypt
would gain from an Israeli pullback
because Cairo will be able to reopen
the Suez Canal and win praise from
the Arab world for securing an Israeli
withdrawal.
Prime Interest
Israel's prime interest is a stable
cease-fire line that would allow it to
bring back the vast reserve army on

duty in the Sinai and rebuild its
war-tattered economy.
Israel also announced it was ready
to discuss separation and
disengagement with Syria — on the
condition Damascus hands over the
names of the estimated 120 Israeli
troops it captured in the October war.
Israeli sources said Sadat had asked
Kissinger during their talks Friday and
Saturday in Egypt to press for an
Israeli-Syrian deal to allay suspicions
among Egypt's Arab friends that Sadat
was working for private settlement
with the Jewish state.

Henry A. Kissinger a breakthrough in
his hectic Middle East diplomacy.
The Israelis declined to disclose the
nature of the proposal.
Kissinger emerged from a final
round of negotiations with Israeli
leaders looking exhausted, but
sounding pleased.
"I will now do my very best to
present the Israeli considerations when
I meet with President Anwar Sadat,"
he told newspersons.
Kissinger and his party flew back to
Egypt last night with the Israeli
proposal. Kissinger plans to return to
Jerusalem tonight with the Egyptian
reaction.
As Kissinger left Jerusalem, the
Israeli military command reported that

day-long skirmishes on the Syrian
front had killed one Israeli soldier. The
Syrian radio claimed 20 Israelis were
killed or wounded in what appeared to
be the most serious clashes on the
northern front in weeks.
Kissinger flew in from Jerusalem
with an outline of details for
withdrawal of the Israeli forces. There
are indications that the Egyptian
reception to Israel's offer might pose
problems.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismail
Fahmy declared yesterday that Egypt
will reject any separate or partial
Middle East peace deal with Israel.
General Lines
It is widely known that the general
lines of Israel's proposal involve Israeli
withdrawal from territory on the
western side of the Suez Canal
captured in the October war, plus
pullback 18 to 30 miles east of the

canal.
In return, the Israelis want Cairo to
remove most of its tanks, missiles and
artillery from east bank territory
captured by Egypt in the war.
Egyptian sources said Sadat
opposes withdrawing the big Egyptian
guns and wants Israel to commit itself
to further withdrawals from the Sinai
peninsula. Israel insists on carrying out
the first pullback before agreeing to
further withdrawals.
Peninsula Occupied
Israel had occupied the entire Sinai
peninsula up to the canal since the
Middle East war of 1967. But last
October's war left jagged cease-fire
lines, with Egyptian forces on the
western bank in some spots and Israeli
forces on the western bank in others.
The result has been frequent
clashes, adding to the urgency of
Kissinger's disengagement efforts
designed to separate the armies and
halt the clashes while the over-all
Geneva peace conference works on a
wider peace accord.
Israeli thinking has been that Egypt
would gain from an Israeli pullback
because Cairo will be able to reopen
the Suez Canal and win praise from
the Arab world for securing an Israeli
withdrawal.
Prime Interest
Israel's prime interest is a stable
cease-fire line that would allow it to
bring back the vast reserve army on

duty in the Sinai and rebuild its
war-tattered economy.
Israel also announced it was ready
to discuss separation and
disengagement with Syria — on the
condition Damascus hands over the
names of the estimated 120 Israeli
troops it captured in the October war.
Israeli sources said Sadat had asked
Kissinger during their talks Friday and
Saturday in Egypt to press for an
Israeli-Syrian deal to allay suspicions
among Egypt's Arab friends that Sadat
was working for private settlement
with the Jewish state.
