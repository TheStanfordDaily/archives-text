Heath To Call Election?
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath is
ready to call a general election next month in a bid
to win emphatic public support for his handling of
Britain's energy crisis, London newspapers reported
yesterday.
The likely date was published as Feb. 7.
In what appeared to be a leak from government
sources, all seven Sunday papers printed front-page
stories saying Heath would decide this week
whether to send the power-starved nation to the
polls.
The consensus was that the Prime Minister would
call elections if talks with labor union leaders
scheduled for today fail to produce agreement on
ending a calamitous slowdown by Britain's 280,000
coal miners.
The Conservative government says the miners'
slowdown was the prime factor that forced it to
order a three-day work week and other fuel-saving
measures designed to combat what Heath calls
Britain's greatest economic crisis since World War 11.
Miami Wins Super Bowl
HOUSTON — The Miami Dolphins, led by
running back Larry Csonka, defeated the Minnesota
Vikings 24-7 yesterday to win their second straight
Super Bowl and earn the right to meet the College
All-Stars this August at Soldier's Field in Chicago.
Csonka, a 6-foot-2, 237-pounder, rushed for a
Super Bowl record 145 yards on a record 33 carries
and scored two of the three Miami touchdowns.
With quarterback Bob Griese's passing picking
the Minnesota secondary apart and Mercury Morris
providing an outside running threat, the Dolphins
jumped to a 14-point lead on their first two
possessions, increased it to 17-0 at the half and
moved ahead 24-0 early in the third period.
Crosby's Lung Partly Removed
BURGLINGAME — Bing Crosby had two-fifths
of his left lung removed in an operation yesterday
after tests suggested the ailing singer might have
cancer, his doctor said.
But an initial study of tissue removed in the
operation indicated the 69-year old Crosby might
have a rare fungus infection in the abcessed lung,
said Dr. Stanley Hanfling, Crosby's family
physician.
He said tests were continuing to determine
whether cancer was present.
Hanfling said Crosby tolerated the surgery well
and was in satisfactory condition at Peninsula
Hospital, where he has been hospitalized since New
Year's Eve with an undetermined lung ailment.
Houston Murder Trial Begins
HOUSTON — The trial of one of two teen-agers
accused in the Houston mass murders gets under
way today with arguments on pretrial motions.
Elmer Wayne Henley, 17, goes on trial for
murder on one of the six counts against him. The
prosecution alleges that over a three-year period
Henley and David Owen Brooks, 18, lured other
teen-agers into a homosexual rape, torture and
murder ring.
Henley will be tried in the death of Charles Ray
Cobble, 17, who lived across the street from him
and disappeared two weeks before his body was
discovered — along with 16 others — buried in a
rented boat shed.
The outcome of the trial could depend on two

motions filed by the defense to suppress oral and
written statements given by Henley to police.
Kidnap Victim Found Dead
JAMESTOWN, N.Y. — A 14-year-old boy who
was kidnaped last week for $15,000 ransom was
found dead yesterday, tied to a tree in a wooded
area near this western New York community, the
FBI said.
Special Agent Richard Ash said a sheriffs deputy
and an FBI man found the body of Daniel Ebersole
following an anonymous telephone call from an
unidentified citizen. He said the boy's father, Dr.
Glen M. Bersole, identified the body.
The boy, clothed in blue jeans and an orange
jacket, had a ski mask pulled down over his head
and a glove stuffed in his mouth, Ash said. He also
was missing one shoe.
The cause of death was not immediately
determined. County Coroner Frederick Hitchcock
said results of an autopsy will be released today.
Three young men were being held on $100,000
cash bond each in Buffalo, after their arraignment
Saturday on federal kidnaping charges. Nearly all
the money was recovered and the trio arrested
Friday, the FBI said.
"We have not discounted the possibility of other
suspects, but we are not seeking anyone else at this
time," Ash said.
"Demos Won't Sit Idly'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., said yesterday he doesn't believe Democrats
"would sit idly by and allow Vice President Gerald
Ford to become president" if President Nixon
resigned.
"I think they might start an effort for a
constitutional amendment whereby there would be
a special election," Goldwater said in an interview
on the NBC-TV program, "Meet the Press."
"If anything like this came about, where we
didn't have an orderly transition, at this time in the
world's history I think it could raise havoc with the
whole world," Goldwater said.
Leary's Group Largest Dealer
WASHINGTON - Dr. Timothy Leary's
Brotherhood of Eternal Love religious organization
expanded to become the largest supplier of hashish
and LSD in the United States, according to Senate
testimony released yesterday.
Federal agents told the Senate Internal Security
subcommittee that the organization, granted
tax-exempt status by California in 1966, has been
severely crippled, although not entirely put out of
business, by federal agents.
They said it reached its high position in the drug
operations by 1969.
They also testified the Internal Revenue Service
and the California Franchise Tax Board have now
assessed the group for more than $70 million in
back taxes.
The subcommittee was told that the drug
operations relied heavily on using false passports,
many obtained with counterfeit birth certificates
and other false documents.
Skepticism Over Tunisia-Libya
TUNIS, Tunisia — Some Arab commentators
expressed open skepticism yesterday that the
sharply different regimes of Tunisia and Libya could
realize the old dream of Arab unity where others

have failed.
They wondered aloud what made Tunisia's
President Habib Bourguiba change his mind and
embrace Col. Moammar Khadafy's union call only
months after he ridiculed it.
The papers said the Libyan leader — a strong
proponent of Arab union — was particularly upset
by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's rejection of a
complete and immediate merger of Egypt and Libya
last year.
But Khadafy's resentment of Egypt left
unanswered the problems raised in the short term
by his differences with Bourguiba, his new partner.
Bourguiba had been the only Arab leader to call
openly for recognition of Israel and negotiations
with that country provided it withdraws from all
occupied territories.
Khadafy continues to call for a holy war on
Israel and liquidation of the Jewish state.
Mercy Killing Trial Begins
MINEOLA, N.Y. — Dr. Vincent Montemarano
goes on trial today charged with the so-called mercy
killing of a patient suffering from neck and throat
cancer, heart disease and pneumonia.
The patient, Eugene Bauer, 59, was in a coma
and had been given less than 48 hours to live when,
the state charges, Dr. Montemarano injected a fatal
dose of potassium chloride on Dec. 7, 1972.
Dr. Montemarano, 33, has pleaded innocent and
is free on $25,000 bail. He has refused to disclose
what line his defense will take.
Dr. Montemarano was chief resident surgeon at
the Nassau County Medical Center at East Meadow
at the time of Bauer's death. He signed a certificate
saying it was due to cancer.
However, Nassau County Dst. Atty. William
Cahn termed it an apparent mercy killing and said
he had evidence, including testimony from a nurse
who was present, about the alleged fatal injection.
"The motive appears to have been a mercy
killing," he said. "The evidence indicates the only
reason was euthanasia."
An autopsy showed no trace to potassium
chloride.
Inflation Will Continue
WASHINGTON — A middle-income family had
to spend $1100 more in 1973 than in 1972 just to
maintain its 1972 living standard, congressional
economists report.
Inflation hit the nation's poor hardest. It shows
no sign of abating this year when rising joblessness,
a sluggish economy and the energy crisis could cause
a recession, according to the report by the staff of
Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
The report said the findings "sketch a gloomy
picture of consumer losses totally at odds with the
administration's litany that the consumer never had
it so good."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain by
evening. Rain likely at times tonight and tomorrow.
Continued mild temperatures. Low both nights in
upper 40s and low 50s. High both days in upper 50s
to mid 60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to
25 mph today. Chance of rain 40 percent today and
60 percent tonight.

back taxes.
The subcommittee was told that the drug
operations relied heavily on using false passports,
many obtained with counterfeit birth certificates
and other false documents.
Skepticism Over Tunisia-Libya
TUNIS, Tunisia — Some Arab commentators
expressed open skepticism yesterday that the
sharply different regimes of Tunisia and Libya could
realize the old dream of Arab unity where others

have failed.
They wondered aloud what made Tunisia's
President Habib Bourguiba change his mind and
embrace Col. Moammar Khadafy's union call only
months after he ridiculed it.
The papers said the Libyan leader — a strong
proponent of Arab union — was particularly upset
by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's rejection of a
complete and immediate merger of Egypt and Libya
last year.
But Khadafy's resentment of Egypt left
unanswered the problems raised in the short term
by his differences with Bourguiba, his new partner.
Bourguiba had been the only Arab leader to call
openly for recognition of Israel and negotiations
with that country provided it withdraws from all
occupied territories.
Khadafy continues to call for a holy war on
Israel and liquidation of the Jewish state.
Mercy Killing Trial Begins
MINEOLA, N.Y. — Dr. Vincent Montemarano
goes on trial today charged with the so-called mercy
killing of a patient suffering from neck and throat
cancer, heart disease and pneumonia.
The patient, Eugene Bauer, 59, was in a coma
and had been given less than 48 hours to live when,
the state charges, Dr. Montemarano injected a fatal
dose of potassium chloride on Dec. 7, 1972.
Dr. Montemarano, 33, has pleaded innocent and
is free on $25,000 bail. He has refused to disclose
what line his defense will take.
Dr. Montemarano was chief resident surgeon at
the Nassau County Medical Center at East Meadow
at the time of Bauer's death. He signed a certificate
saying it was due to cancer.
However, Nassau County Dst. Atty. William
Cahn termed it an apparent mercy killing and said
he had evidence, including testimony from a nurse
who was present, about the alleged fatal injection.
"The motive appears to have been a mercy
killing," he said. "The evidence indicates the only
reason was euthanasia."
An autopsy showed no trace to potassium
chloride.
Inflation Will Continue
WASHINGTON — A middle-income family had
to spend $1100 more in 1973 than in 1972 just to
maintain its 1972 living standard, congressional
economists report.
Inflation hit the nation's poor hardest. It shows
no sign of abating this year when rising joblessness,
a sluggish economy and the energy crisis could cause
a recession, according to the report by the staff of
Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
The report said the findings "sketch a gloomy
picture of consumer losses totally at odds with the
administration's litany that the consumer never had
it so good."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain by
evening. Rain likely at times tonight and tomorrow.
Continued mild temperatures. Low both nights in
upper 40s and low 50s. High both days in upper 50s

25 mph today. Chance of rain 40 percent today and
60 percent tonight.
Heath To Call Election?
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath is
ready to call a general election next month in a bid
to win emphatic public support for his handling of
Britain's energy crisis, London newspapers reported
yesterday.
The likely date was published as Feb. 7.
In what appeared to be a leak from government
sources, all seven Sunday papers printed front-page
stories saying Heath would decide this week
whether to send the power-starved nation to the
polls.
The consensus was that the Prime Minister would
call elections if talks with labor union leaders
scheduled for today fail to produce agreement on
ending a calamitous slowdown by Britain's 280,000
coal miners.
The Conservative government says the miners'
slowdown was the prime factor that forced it to
order a three-day work week and other fuel-saving
measures designed to combat what Heath calls
Britain's greatest economic crisis since World War 11.
Miami Wins Super Bowl
HOUSTON — The Miami Dolphins, led by
running back Larry Csonka, defeated the Minnesota
Vikings 24-7 yesterday to win their second straight
Super Bowl and earn the right to meet the College
All-Stars this August at Soldier's Field in Chicago.
Csonka, a 6-foot-2, 237-pounder, rushed for a
Super Bowl record 145 yards on a record 33 carries
and scored two of the three Miami touchdowns.
With quarterback Bob Griese's passing picking
the Minnesota secondary apart and Mercury Morris
providing an outside running threat, the Dolphins
jumped to a 14-point lead on their first two
possessions, increased it to 17-0 at the half and
moved ahead 24-0 early in the third period.
Crosby's Lung Partly Removed
BURGLINGAME — Bing Crosby had two-fifths
of his left lung removed in an operation yesterday
after tests suggested the ailing singer might have
cancer, his doctor said.
But an initial study of tissue removed in the
operation indicated the 69-year old Crosby might
have a rare fungus infection in the abcessed lung,
said Dr. Stanley Hanfling, Crosby's family
physician.
He said tests were continuing to determine
whether cancer was present.
Hanfling said Crosby tolerated the surgery well
and was in satisfactory condition at Peninsula
Hospital, where he has been hospitalized since New
Year's Eve with an undetermined lung ailment.
Houston Murder Trial Begins
HOUSTON — The trial of one of two teen-agers
accused in the Houston mass murders gets under
way today with arguments on pretrial motions.
Elmer Wayne Henley, 17, goes on trial for
murder on one of the six counts against him. The
prosecution alleges that over a three-year period
Henley and David Owen Brooks, 18, lured other
teen-agers into a homosexual rape, torture and
murder ring.
Henley will be tried in the death of Charles Ray
Cobble, 17, who lived across the street from him
and disappeared two weeks before his body was
discovered — along with 16 others — buried in a
rented boat shed.
The outcome of the trial could depend on two

motions filed by the defense to suppress oral and
written statements given by Henley to police.
Kidnap Victim Found Dead
JAMESTOWN, N.Y. — A 14-year-old boy who
was kidnaped last week for $15,000 ransom was
found dead yesterday, tied to a tree in a wooded
area near this western New York community, the
FBI said.
Special Agent Richard Ash said a sheriffs deputy
and an FBI man found the body of Daniel Ebersole
following an anonymous telephone call from an
unidentified citizen. He said the boy's father, Dr.
Glen M. Bersole, identified the body.
The boy, clothed in blue jeans and an orange
jacket, had a ski mask pulled down over his head
and a glove stuffed in his mouth, Ash said. He also
was missing one shoe.
The cause of death was not immediately
determined. County Coroner Frederick Hitchcock
said results of an autopsy will be released today.
Three young men were being held on $100,000
cash bond each in Buffalo, after their arraignment
Saturday on federal kidnaping charges. Nearly all
the money was recovered and the trio arrested
Friday, the FBI said.
"We have not discounted the possibility of other
suspects, but we are not seeking anyone else at this
time," Ash said.
"Demos Won't Sit Idly'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., said yesterday he doesn't believe Democrats
"would sit idly by and allow Vice President Gerald
Ford to become president" if President Nixon
resigned.
"I think they might start an effort for a
constitutional amendment whereby there would be
a special election," Goldwater said in an interview
on the NBC-TV program, "Meet the Press."
"If anything like this came about, where we
didn't have an orderly transition, at this time in the
world's history I think it could raise havoc with the
whole world," Goldwater said.
Leary's Group Largest Dealer
WASHINGTON - Dr. Timothy Leary's
Brotherhood of Eternal Love religious organization
expanded to become the largest supplier of hashish
and LSD in the United States, according to Senate
testimony released yesterday.
Federal agents told the Senate Internal Security
subcommittee that the organization, granted
tax-exempt status by California in 1966, has been
severely crippled, although not entirely put out of
business, by federal agents.
They said it reached its high position in the drug
operations by 1969.
They also testified the Internal Revenue Service
and the California Franchise Tax Board have now
assessed the group for more than $70 million in
back taxes.
The subcommittee was told that the drug
operations relied heavily on using false passports,
many obtained with counterfeit birth certificates
and other false documents.

Hanfling said Crosby tolerated the surgery well
and was in satisfactory condition at Peninsula
Hospital, where he has been hospitalized since New
Year's Eve with an undetermined lung ailment.
Houston Murder Trial Begins
HOUSTON — The trial of one of two teen-agers
accused in the Houston mass murders gets under
way today with arguments on pretrial motions.
Elmer Wayne Henley, 17, goes on trial for
murder on one of the six counts against him. The
prosecution alleges that over a three-year period
Henley and David Owen Brooks, 18, lured other
teen-agers into a homosexual rape, torture and
murder ring.
Henley will be tried in the death of Charles Ray
Cobble, 17, who lived across the street from him
and disappeared two weeks before his body was
discovered — along with 16 others — buried in a
rented boat shed.
The outcome of the trial could depend on two

motions filed by the defense to suppress oral and
written statements given by Henley to police.
Kidnap Victim Found Dead
JAMESTOWN, N.Y. — A 14-year-old boy who
was kidnaped last week for $15,000 ransom was
found dead yesterday, tied to a tree in a wooded
area near this western New York community, the
FBI said.
Special Agent Richard Ash said a sheriffs deputy
and an FBI man found the body of Daniel Ebersole
following an anonymous telephone call from an
unidentified citizen. He said the boy's father, Dr.
Glen M. Bersole, identified the body.
The boy, clothed in blue jeans and an orange
jacket, had a ski mask pulled down over his head
and a glove stuffed in his mouth, Ash said. He also
was missing one shoe.
The cause of death was not immediately
determined. County Coroner Frederick Hitchcock
said results of an autopsy will be released today.
Three young men were being held on $100,000
cash bond each in Buffalo, after their arraignment
Saturday on federal kidnaping charges. Nearly all
the money was recovered and the trio arrested
Friday, the FBI said.
"We have not discounted the possibility of other
suspects, but we are not seeking anyone else at this
time," Ash said.
"Demos Won't Sit Idly'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., said yesterday he doesn't believe Democrats
"would sit idly by and allow Vice President Gerald
Ford to become president" if President Nixon
resigned.
"I think they might start an effort for a
constitutional amendment whereby there would be
a special election," Goldwater said in an interview
on the NBC-TV program, "Meet the Press."
"If anything like this came about, where we
didn't have an orderly transition, at this time in the
world's history I think it could raise havoc with the
whole world," Goldwater said.
Leary's Group Largest Dealer
WASHINGTON - Dr. Timothy Leary's
Brotherhood of Eternal Love religious organization
expanded to become the largest supplier of hashish
and LSD in the United States, according to Senate
testimony released yesterday.
Federal agents told the Senate Internal Security
subcommittee that the organization, granted
tax-exempt status by California in 1966, has been
severely crippled, although not entirely put out of
business, by federal agents.
They said it reached its high position in the drug
operations by 1969.
They also testified the Internal Revenue Service
and the California Franchise Tax Board have now
assessed the group for more than $70 million in
back taxes.
The subcommittee was told that the drug
operations relied heavily on using false passports,
many obtained with counterfeit birth certificates
and other false documents.
Skepticism Over Tunisia-Libya
TUNIS, Tunisia — Some Arab commentators
expressed open skepticism yesterday that the
sharply different regimes of Tunisia and Libya could
realize the old dream of Arab unity where others

have failed.
They wondered aloud what made Tunisia's
President Habib Bourguiba change his mind and
embrace Col. Moammar Khadafy's union call only
months after he ridiculed it.
The papers said the Libyan leader — a strong
proponent of Arab union — was particularly upset
by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's rejection of a
complete and immediate merger of Egypt and Libya
last year.
But Khadafy's resentment of Egypt left
unanswered the problems raised in the short term
by his differences with Bourguiba, his new partner.
Bourguiba had been the only Arab leader to call
openly for recognition of Israel and negotiations
with that country provided it withdraws from all
occupied territories.
Khadafy continues to call for a holy war on
Israel and liquidation of the Jewish state.
Mercy Killing Trial Begins
MINEOLA, N.Y. — Dr. Vincent Montemarano
goes on trial today charged with the so-called mercy
killing of a patient suffering from neck and throat
cancer, heart disease and pneumonia.
The patient, Eugene Bauer, 59, was in a coma
and had been given less than 48 hours to live when,
the state charges, Dr. Montemarano injected a fatal
dose of potassium chloride on Dec. 7, 1972.
Dr. Montemarano, 33, has pleaded innocent and
is free on $25,000 bail. He has refused to disclose
what line his defense will take.
Dr. Montemarano was chief resident surgeon at
the Nassau County Medical Center at East Meadow
at the time of Bauer's death. He signed a certificate
saying it was due to cancer.
However, Nassau County Dst. Atty. William
Cahn termed it an apparent mercy killing and said
he had evidence, including testimony from a nurse
who was present, about the alleged fatal injection.
"The motive appears to have been a mercy
killing," he said. "The evidence indicates the only
reason was euthanasia."
An autopsy showed no trace to potassium
chloride.
Inflation Will Continue
WASHINGTON — A middle-income family had
to spend $1100 more in 1973 than in 1972 just to
maintain its 1972 living standard, congressional
economists report.
Inflation hit the nation's poor hardest. It shows
no sign of abating this year when rising joblessness,
a sluggish economy and the energy crisis could cause
a recession, according to the report by the staff of
Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
The report said the findings "sketch a gloomy
picture of consumer losses totally at odds with the
administration's litany that the consumer never had
it so good."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain by
evening. Rain likely at times tonight and tomorrow.
Continued mild temperatures. Low both nights in
upper 40s and low 50s. High both days in upper 50s
to mid 60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to
25 mph today. Chance of rain 40 percent today and
60 percent tonight.
Heath To Call Election?
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath is
ready to call a general election next month in a bid
to win emphatic public support for his handling of
Britain's energy crisis, London newspapers reported
yesterday.
The likely date was published as Feb. 7.
In what appeared to be a leak from government
sources, all seven Sunday papers printed front-page
stories saying Heath would decide this week
whether to send the power-starved nation to the
polls.
The consensus was that the Prime Minister would
call elections if talks with labor union leaders
scheduled for today fail to produce agreement on
ending a calamitous slowdown by Britain's 280,000
coal miners.
The Conservative government says the miners'
slowdown was the prime factor that forced it to
order a three-day work week and other fuel-saving
measures designed to combat what Heath calls
Britain's greatest economic crisis since World War 11.
Miami Wins Super Bowl
HOUSTON — The Miami Dolphins, led by
running back Larry Csonka, defeated the Minnesota
Vikings 24-7 yesterday to win their second straight
Super Bowl and earn the right to meet the College
All-Stars this August at Soldier's Field in Chicago.
Csonka, a 6-foot-2, 237-pounder, rushed for a
Super Bowl record 145 yards on a record 33 carries
and scored two of the three Miami touchdowns.
With quarterback Bob Griese's passing picking
the Minnesota secondary apart and Mercury Morris
providing an outside running threat, the Dolphins
jumped to a 14-point lead on their first two
possessions, increased it to 17-0 at the half and
moved ahead 24-0 early in the third period.
Crosby's Lung Partly Removed
BURGLINGAME — Bing Crosby had two-fifths
of his left lung removed in an operation yesterday
after tests suggested the ailing singer might have
cancer, his doctor said.
But an initial study of tissue removed in the
operation indicated the 69-year old Crosby might
have a rare fungus infection in the abcessed lung,
said Dr. Stanley Hanfling, Crosby's family
physician.
He said tests were continuing to determine
whether cancer was present.
Hanfling said Crosby tolerated the surgery well
and was in satisfactory condition at Peninsula
Hospital, where he has been hospitalized since New
Year's Eve with an undetermined lung ailment.

"The motive appears to have been a mercy
killing," he said. "The evidence indicates the only
reason was euthanasia."
An autopsy showed no trace to potassium
chloride.
Inflation Will Continue
WASHINGTON — A middle-income family had
to spend $1100 more in 1973 than in 1972 just to
maintain its 1972 living standard, congressional
economists report.
Inflation hit the nation's poor hardest. It shows
no sign of abating this year when rising joblessness,
a sluggish economy and the energy crisis could cause
a recession, according to the report by the staff of
Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
The report said the findings "sketch a gloomy
picture of consumer losses totally at odds with the
administration's litany that the consumer never had
it so good."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain by
evening. Rain likely at times tonight and tomorrow.
Continued mild temperatures. Low both nights in
upper 40s and low 50s. High both days in upper 50s
to mid 60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to
25 mph today. Chance of rain 40 percent today and
60 percent tonight.
Heath To Call Election?
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath is
ready to call a general election next month in a bid
to win emphatic public support for his handling of
Britain's energy crisis, London newspapers reported
yesterday.
The likely date was published as Feb. 7.
In what appeared to be a leak from government
sources, all seven Sunday papers printed front-page
stories saying Heath would decide this week
whether to send the power-starved nation to the
polls.
The consensus was that the Prime Minister would
call elections if talks with labor union leaders
scheduled for today fail to produce agreement on
ending a calamitous slowdown by Britain's 280,000
coal miners.
The Conservative government says the miners'
slowdown was the prime factor that forced it to
order a three-day work week and other fuel-saving
measures designed to combat what Heath calls
Britain's greatest economic crisis since World War 11.
Miami Wins Super Bowl
HOUSTON — The Miami Dolphins, led by
running back Larry Csonka, defeated the Minnesota
Vikings 24-7 yesterday to win their second straight
Super Bowl and earn the right to meet the College
All-Stars this August at Soldier's Field in Chicago.
Csonka, a 6-foot-2, 237-pounder, rushed for a
Super Bowl record 145 yards on a record 33 carries
and scored two of the three Miami touchdowns.
With quarterback Bob Griese's passing picking
the Minnesota secondary apart and Mercury Morris
providing an outside running threat, the Dolphins
jumped to a 14-point lead on their first two
possessions, increased it to 17-0 at the half and
moved ahead 24-0 early in the third period.
Crosby's Lung Partly Removed
BURGLINGAME — Bing Crosby had two-fifths
of his left lung removed in an operation yesterday
after tests suggested the ailing singer might have
cancer, his doctor said.
But an initial study of tissue removed in the
operation indicated the 69-year old Crosby might
have a rare fungus infection in the abcessed lung,
said Dr. Stanley Hanfling, Crosby's family
physician.
He said tests were continuing to determine
whether cancer was present.
Hanfling said Crosby tolerated the surgery well
and was in satisfactory condition at Peninsula
Hospital, where he has been hospitalized since New
Year's Eve with an undetermined lung ailment.
Houston Murder Trial Begins
HOUSTON — The trial of one of two teen-agers
accused in the Houston mass murders gets under
way today with arguments on pretrial motions.
Elmer Wayne Henley, 17, goes on trial for
murder on one of the six counts against him. The
prosecution alleges that over a three-year period
Henley and David Owen Brooks, 18, lured other
teen-agers into a homosexual rape, torture and
murder ring.
Henley will be tried in the death of Charles Ray
Cobble, 17, who lived across the street from him
and disappeared two weeks before his body was
discovered — along with 16 others — buried in a
rented boat shed.
The outcome of the trial could depend on two

motions filed by the defense to suppress oral and
written statements given by Henley to police.
Kidnap Victim Found Dead
JAMESTOWN, N.Y. — A 14-year-old boy who
was kidnaped last week for $15,000 ransom was
found dead yesterday, tied to a tree in a wooded
area near this western New York community, the
FBI said.
Special Agent Richard Ash said a sheriffs deputy
and an FBI man found the body of Daniel Ebersole
following an anonymous telephone call from an
unidentified citizen. He said the boy's father, Dr.
Glen M. Bersole, identified the body.
The boy, clothed in blue jeans and an orange
jacket, had a ski mask pulled down over his head
and a glove stuffed in his mouth, Ash said. He also
was missing one shoe.
The cause of death was not immediately
determined. County Coroner Frederick Hitchcock
said results of an autopsy will be released today.
Three young men were being held on $100,000
cash bond each in Buffalo, after their arraignment
Saturday on federal kidnaping charges. Nearly all
the money was recovered and the trio arrested
Friday, the FBI said.
"We have not discounted the possibility of other
suspects, but we are not seeking anyone else at this
time," Ash said.
"Demos Won't Sit Idly'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., said yesterday he doesn't believe Democrats
"would sit idly by and allow Vice President Gerald
Ford to become president" if President Nixon
resigned.
"I think they might start an effort for a
constitutional amendment whereby there would be
a special election," Goldwater said in an interview
on the NBC-TV program, "Meet the Press."
"If anything like this came about, where we
didn't have an orderly transition, at this time in the
world's history I think it could raise havoc with the
whole world," Goldwater said.
Leary's Group Largest Dealer
WASHINGTON - Dr. Timothy Leary's
Brotherhood of Eternal Love religious organization
expanded to become the largest supplier of hashish
and LSD in the United States, according to Senate
testimony released yesterday.
Federal agents told the Senate Internal Security
subcommittee that the organization, granted
tax-exempt status by California in 1966, has been
severely crippled, although not entirely put out of
business, by federal agents.
They said it reached its high position in the drug
operations by 1969.
They also testified the Internal Revenue Service
and the California Franchise Tax Board have now
assessed the group for more than $70 million in
back taxes.
The subcommittee was told that the drug
operations relied heavily on using false passports,
many obtained with counterfeit birth certificates
and other false documents.
Skepticism Over Tunisia-Libya
TUNIS, Tunisia — Some Arab commentators
expressed open skepticism yesterday that the
sharply different regimes of Tunisia and Libya could
realize the old dream of Arab unity where others

have failed.
They wondered aloud what made Tunisia's
President Habib Bourguiba change his mind and
embrace Col. Moammar Khadafy's union call only
months after he ridiculed it.
The papers said the Libyan leader — a strong
proponent of Arab union — was particularly upset
by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's rejection of a
complete and immediate merger of Egypt and Libya
last year.
But Khadafy's resentment of Egypt left
unanswered the problems raised in the short term
by his differences with Bourguiba, his new partner.
Bourguiba had been the only Arab leader to call
openly for recognition of Israel and negotiations
with that country provided it withdraws from all
occupied territories.
Khadafy continues to call for a holy war on
Israel and liquidation of the Jewish state.
Mercy Killing Trial Begins
MINEOLA, N.Y. — Dr. Vincent Montemarano
goes on trial today charged with the so-called mercy
killing of a patient suffering from neck and throat
cancer, heart disease and pneumonia.
The patient, Eugene Bauer, 59, was in a coma
and had been given less than 48 hours to live when,
the state charges, Dr. Montemarano injected a fatal
dose of potassium chloride on Dec. 7, 1972.
Dr. Montemarano, 33, has pleaded innocent and
is free on $25,000 bail. He has refused to disclose
what line his defense will take.
Dr. Montemarano was chief resident surgeon at
the Nassau County Medical Center at East Meadow
at the time of Bauer's death. He signed a certificate
saying it was due to cancer.
However, Nassau County Dst. Atty. William
Cahn termed it an apparent mercy killing and said
he had evidence, including testimony from a nurse
who was present, about the alleged fatal injection.
"The motive appears to have been a mercy
killing," he said. "The evidence indicates the only
reason was euthanasia."
An autopsy showed no trace to potassium
chloride.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., said yesterday he doesn't believe Democrats
"would sit idly by and allow Vice President Gerald
Ford to become president" if President Nixon
resigned.
"I think they might start an effort for a
constitutional amendment whereby there would be
a special election," Goldwater said in an interview
on the NBC-TV program, "Meet the Press."
"If anything like this came about, where we
didn't have an orderly transition, at this time in the
world's history I think it could raise havoc with the
whole world," Goldwater said.
Leary's Group Largest Dealer
WASHINGTON - Dr. Timothy Leary's
Brotherhood of Eternal Love religious organization
expanded to become the largest supplier of hashish
and LSD in the United States, according to Senate
testimony released yesterday.
Federal agents told the Senate Internal Security
subcommittee that the organization, granted
tax-exempt status by California in 1966, has been
severely crippled, although not entirely put out of
business, by federal agents.
They said it reached its high position in the drug
operations by 1969.
They also testified the Internal Revenue Service
and the California Franchise Tax Board have now
assessed the group for more than $70 million in
back taxes.
The subcommittee was told that the drug
operations relied heavily on using false passports,
many obtained with counterfeit birth certificates
and other false documents.
Skepticism Over Tunisia-Libya
TUNIS, Tunisia — Some Arab commentators
expressed open skepticism yesterday that the
sharply different regimes of Tunisia and Libya could
realize the old dream of Arab unity where others

have failed.
They wondered aloud what made Tunisia's
President Habib Bourguiba change his mind and
embrace Col. Moammar Khadafy's union call only
months after he ridiculed it.
The papers said the Libyan leader — a strong
proponent of Arab union — was particularly upset
by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's rejection of a
complete and immediate merger of Egypt and Libya
last year.
But Khadafy's resentment of Egypt left
unanswered the problems raised in the short term
by his differences with Bourguiba, his new partner.
Bourguiba had been the only Arab leader to call
openly for recognition of Israel and negotiations
with that country provided it withdraws from all
occupied territories.
Khadafy continues to call for a holy war on
Israel and liquidation of the Jewish state.
Mercy Killing Trial Begins
MINEOLA, N.Y. — Dr. Vincent Montemarano
goes on trial today charged with the so-called mercy
killing of a patient suffering from neck and throat
cancer, heart disease and pneumonia.
The patient, Eugene Bauer, 59, was in a coma
and had been given less than 48 hours to live when,
the state charges, Dr. Montemarano injected a fatal
dose of potassium chloride on Dec. 7, 1972.
Dr. Montemarano, 33, has pleaded innocent and
is free on $25,000 bail. He has refused to disclose
what line his defense will take.
Dr. Montemarano was chief resident surgeon at
the Nassau County Medical Center at East Meadow
at the time of Bauer's death. He signed a certificate
saying it was due to cancer.
However, Nassau County Dst. Atty. William
Cahn termed it an apparent mercy killing and said
he had evidence, including testimony from a nurse
who was present, about the alleged fatal injection.
"The motive appears to have been a mercy
killing," he said. "The evidence indicates the only
reason was euthanasia."
An autopsy showed no trace to potassium
chloride.
Inflation Will Continue
WASHINGTON — A middle-income family had
to spend $1100 more in 1973 than in 1972 just to
maintain its 1972 living standard, congressional
economists report.
Inflation hit the nation's poor hardest. It shows
no sign of abating this year when rising joblessness,
a sluggish economy and the energy crisis could cause
a recession, according to the report by the staff of
Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
The report said the findings "sketch a gloomy
picture of consumer losses totally at odds with the
administration's litany that the consumer never had
it so good."
