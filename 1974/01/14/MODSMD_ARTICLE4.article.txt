# Stanford, Palo Alto End Dispute Over County Zoning Ordinance
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Stanford and Palo Alto officials
Friday announced a settlement in their
dispute regarding whether Santa Clara
County's proposed "cs" zone should
be extended to the University campus.
Palo Alto and University officials
agreed to ask the county for
"permitted land use" for Stanford
under the "cs" ordinance, a request
that would preclude an extension of
the city's control over Stanford.
"It looks as if we've reached an
amicable decision," Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, declared. "The initiative
is with the County Planning
Commission and the Board of
Supervisors now."
The compromise was reached in an
Encina Hall meeting attended by
Augsburger, Geraldine Steinberg and
Ed Teresi of the County Planning
Commission, and Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson and Stanly Norton of the
Palo Alto City Council.
Compromise Recommended
The three city council members will
recommend the compromise plan to
the full council at its Jan. 21 meeting.
The Santa Clara County Planning
Commission will discuss the "cs" zone
and the proposed amendment
regarding Stanford probably no sooner
than Feb. 7, according to Augsburger.
In return for Palo Alto's
cooperation with Stanford's case
against inclusion in the "cs" zone, the
University agreed to seek removal of
certain Stanford lands from a blanket
use permit issued by the county in
1962. Areas affected by the removal
of the permit would be the arboretum
and the land along Willow Road, as
well as portions of the golf course.
But Stanford would still retain a
minimal blanket use permit for those
areas as well as a blanket use perquisite
for the rest of the campus, Augsburger
explained.
Furthermore, Stanford agreed to

supply Palo Alto with notification of
all future projects and plans. This
courtesy would give Palo Alto an
opportunity to protest development
proposals at hearings of the County
Planning Commission if the city
believed that such plans would have a
harmful environmental impact.
The "cs" zone dispute, an example
of the ancient "town/gown" conflict
between universities and their
environs, threatened to disrupt
normally smooth relations between
Stanford and Palo Alto.
The controversy concerned the
"city services combining zone," an
ordinance proposed by the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors in an
effort to halt indiscriminate urban
growth.
Annexation Forced
Under the provisions of the
ordinance, anyone who wanted to
develop land adjacent to municipalities
would be forced to apply to the
county for annexation of those lands
to the cities they bordered. The
proposed ordinance would therefore
have had the effect of extending Palo
Alto control over Stanford lands.
The city had sought a virtual veto
power over development of University
lands fronting on El Camino Real and
the area along Willow Road west of
Pasteur Drive.
Palo Alto officials contended that
those lands weren't used for academic
purposes and since they bordered the
city, Palo Alto had a legitimate right
to exercise some control over their
use. Stanford's past record of excellent
planning did not insure careful
development in the future, Palo Alto
City Planning Director Naphtali Knox
argued.
Stanford officials claimed that an
extension of the city's control would
impair academic freedom. They
contended that Stanford's provisions
for its own municipal services made
the application of the "cs" ordinance

to the University superfluous.
In a letter to the Palo Alto City
Council in November, at the height of
the controversy, University President
Richard Lyman stated, "We would be
the first to pay the price if we were to
let expansion run rampant. We take
pride in the fact that this University
undertook sensitive development
policies long before that became
fashionable. Then again, we would be
foolhardy to take an action that
damaged Palo Alto. We want to exist
as a good neighbor and respect each
other's rights and wishes.
"Instead of striving to control and

to homogenize, we should be
recognizing and nurturing initiative
and diversity wherever they exist. We
should be rejoicing in the uniqueness
of an institution that is neither a
private firm nor another city. We
should be finding ways for Stanford
and Palo Alto to coexist without one
dominating the other."
Most observers of the dispute
between the city and the University
were surprised by the rapidity with
which the compromise was reached at
Friday's meeting after months of
stalemate.

harmful environmental impact.
The "cs" zone dispute, an example
of the ancient "town/gown" conflict
between universities and their
environs, threatened to disrupt
normally smooth relations between
Stanford and Palo Alto.
The controversy concerned the
"city services combining zone," an
ordinance proposed by the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors in an
effort to halt indiscriminate urban
growth.
Annexation Forced
Under the provisions of the
ordinance, anyone who wanted to
develop land adjacent to municipalities
would be forced to apply to the
county for annexation of those lands
to the cities they bordered. The
proposed ordinance would therefore
have had the effect of extending Palo
Alto control over Stanford lands.
The city had sought a virtual veto
power over development of University
lands fronting on El Camino Real and
the area along Willow Road west of
Pasteur Drive.
Palo Alto officials contended that
those lands weren't used for academic
purposes and since they bordered the
city, Palo Alto had a legitimate right
to exercise some control over their
use. Stanford's past record of excellent
planning did not insure careful
development in the future, Palo Alto
City Planning Director Naphtali Knox
argued.
Stanford officials claimed that an
extension of the city's control would
impair academic freedom. They
contended that Stanford's provisions
for its own municipal services made
the application of the "cs" ordinance

to the University superfluous.
In a letter to the Palo Alto City
Council in November, at the height of
the controversy, University President
Richard Lyman stated, "We would be
the first to pay the price if we were to
let expansion run rampant. We take
pride in the fact that this University
undertook sensitive development
policies long before that became
fashionable. Then again, we would be
foolhardy to take an action that
damaged Palo Alto. We want to exist
as a good neighbor and respect each
other's rights and wishes.
"Instead of striving to control and

to homogenize, we should be
recognizing and nurturing initiative
and diversity wherever they exist. We
should be rejoicing in the uniqueness
of an institution that is neither a
private firm nor another city. We
should be finding ways for Stanford
and Palo Alto to coexist without one
dominating the other."
Most observers of the dispute
between the city and the University
were surprised by the rapidity with
which the compromise was reached at
Friday's meeting after months of
stalemate.
Stanford and Palo Alto officials
Friday announced a settlement in their
dispute regarding whether Santa Clara
County's proposed "cs" zone should
be extended to the University campus.
Palo Alto and University officials
agreed to ask the county for
"permitted land use" for Stanford
under the "cs" ordinance, a request
that would preclude an extension of
the city's control over Stanford.
"It looks as if we've reached an
amicable decision," Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, declared. "The initiative
is with the County Planning
Commission and the Board of
Supervisors now."
The compromise was reached in an
Encina Hall meeting attended by
Augsburger, Geraldine Steinberg and
Ed Teresi of the County Planning
Commission, and Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson and Stanly Norton of the
Palo Alto City Council.
Compromise Recommended
The three city council members will
recommend the compromise plan to
the full council at its Jan. 21 meeting.
The Santa Clara County Planning
Commission will discuss the "cs" zone
and the proposed amendment
regarding Stanford probably no sooner
than Feb. 7, according to Augsburger.
In return for Palo Alto's
cooperation with Stanford's case
against inclusion in the "cs" zone, the
University agreed to seek removal of
certain Stanford lands from a blanket
use permit issued by the county in
1962. Areas affected by the removal
of the permit would be the arboretum
and the land along Willow Road, as
well as portions of the golf course.
But Stanford would still retain a
minimal blanket use permit for those
areas as well as a blanket use perquisite
for the rest of the campus, Augsburger
explained.
Furthermore, Stanford agreed to

supply Palo Alto with notification of
all future projects and plans. This
courtesy would give Palo Alto an
opportunity to protest development
proposals at hearings of the County
Planning Commission if the city
believed that such plans would have a
harmful environmental impact.
