# Races Shaping Up In Area Elections
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Many local politicians and would-be
politicians are still testing the waters
for possible legislative races this year,
but although filing deadlines for the
June primaries are still some weeks
away, some races already appear to be
shaping up.
As has been generally expected, it
appears that there will again be a
conservative challenge to U.S. Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park,
in the Republican congressional
primary. J. Gordon Knapp, the
wealthy president of Calso Water
Corp. in Menlo Park, has already hired
a press secretary — two-time ASSU
presidential candidate Chris Hocker —
and has been spending several hours a
day setting up his campaign.
Knapp ran as a write-in in the 1972
general election on a platform of
support for President Nixon. He
received about nine percent of the
vote against the maverick McCloskey
and liberal Democratic challenger
James Stewart.
In the 1972 primary, McCloskey
won renomination over two
challengers who split the conservative
vote, Palo Alto physician Royce Cole
and former Rep. Robert Barry,
R-N.Y., now living in Woodside.
McCloskey received a plurality, but
well less than a majority, in that
election.
However, the situation has changed
somewhat since then, this may work in
McCloskey's favor. For one thing,
reapportionment has modified
McCloskey's district — formerly the
17th and now the 12th — and has
eliminated some former pockets of
conservatism in the north as well as
some liberal Democratic strength in
the south. Local McCloskey staffers
were openly pleased with the district;
they feel it increases his chances.
On the Democratic side, no
opposition for McCloskey has formally
surfaced, but 1972 nominee Stewart
and Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor,

beaten by Stewart in the primary, have
both been mentioned as possible
contenders. McCloskey easily beat
Stewart last time out, but some
observers predict that the Palo Alto
attorney will run again and hope that
Knapp upsets McCloskey in the GOP
primary, on the theory that Knapp
would be easier to beat in November.
In the race for the newly-created
10th state Senate district, freshman
Sen. Arlen P. Gregorio, D-San Mateo,
received a boost of sorts when
Assemblyman Dixon Amett,
R-Redwood City, announced last
month that he'll seek reelection to the
Assembly rather than oppose
Gregorio.
Instead, Donald W. Spicer, a health
care consultant from Palo Alto,
announced his candidacy last week. He
told the Daily yesterday that he plans
to stress the theme that "people are
part of the ecology too" — that
ecologists may be overemphasizing
conservation and that "we ought to
restore some balance."
The new 21st state Assembly
district will have no incumbent
running. Santa Clara County
Supervisor Victor J. Calvo has already
announced his candidacy for the
Democratic nomination . the former
mayor of Mountain View is considered
a strong candidate.
For the Republicans, several names
have been mentioned, with the
strongest candidate — if he runs —
apparently Michael Cobb, chairman of
the Santa Clara County Republican
Central Committee. Others mentioned
have been Sunnyvale City
Councilwoman Etta Albert, Lockheed
Aircraft employee Clarence Jackson of
Palo Alto and Los Altos attorney
Herbert Smith.
Prospective candidates must file
declarations of intent to run between
Jan. 28 and Feb. 6. Actual
declarations of candidacy are due
several weeks later.

politicians are still testing the waters
for possible legislative races this year,
but although filing deadlines for the
June primaries are still some weeks
away, some races already appear to be
shaping up.
As has been generally expected, it
appears that there will again be a
conservative challenge to U.S. Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park,
in the Republican congressional
primary. J. Gordon Knapp, the
wealthy president of Calso Water
Corp. in Menlo Park, has already hired
a press secretary — two-time ASSU
presidential candidate Chris Hocker —
and has been spending several hours a
day setting up his campaign.
Knapp ran as a write-in in the 1972
general election on a platform of
support for President Nixon. He
received about nine percent of the
vote against the maverick McCloskey
and liberal Democratic challenger
James Stewart.
In the 1972 primary, McCloskey
won renomination over two
challengers who split the conservative
vote, Palo Alto physician Royce Cole
and former Rep. Robert Barry,
R-N.Y., now living in Woodside.
McCloskey received a plurality, but
well less than a majority, in that
election.
However, the situation has changed
somewhat since then, this may work in
McCloskey's favor. For one thing,
reapportionment has modified
McCloskey's district — formerly the
17th and now the 12th — and has
eliminated some former pockets of
conservatism in the north as well as
some liberal Democratic strength in
the south. Local McCloskey staffers
were openly pleased with the district;
they feel it increases his chances.
On the Democratic side, no
opposition for McCloskey has formally
surfaced, but 1972 nominee Stewart
and Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor,

beaten by Stewart in the primary, have
both been mentioned as possible
contenders. McCloskey easily beat
Stewart last time out, but some
observers predict that the Palo Alto
attorney will run again and hope that
Knapp upsets McCloskey in the GOP
primary, on the theory that Knapp
would be easier to beat in November.
In the race for the newly-created
10th state Senate district, freshman
Sen. Arlen P. Gregorio, D-San Mateo,
received a boost of sorts when
Assemblyman Dixon Amett,
R-Redwood City, announced last
month that he'll seek reelection to the
Assembly rather than oppose
Gregorio.
Instead, Donald W. Spicer, a health
care consultant from Palo Alto,
announced his candidacy last week. He
told the Daily yesterday that he plans
to stress the theme that "people are
part of the ecology too" — that
ecologists may be overemphasizing
conservation and that "we ought to
restore some balance."
The new 21st state Assembly
district will have no incumbent
running. Santa Clara County
Supervisor Victor J. Calvo has already
announced his candidacy for the
Democratic nomination . the former
mayor of Mountain View is considered
a strong candidate.
For the Republicans, several names
have been mentioned, with the
strongest candidate — if he runs —
apparently Michael Cobb, chairman of
the Santa Clara County Republican
Central Committee. Others mentioned
have been Sunnyvale City
Councilwoman Etta Albert, Lockheed
Aircraft employee Clarence Jackson of
Palo Alto and Los Altos attorney
Herbert Smith.
Prospective candidates must file
declarations of intent to run between
Jan. 28 and Feb. 6. Actual
declarations of candidacy are due
several weeks later.
