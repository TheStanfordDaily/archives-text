# 'Claw' Undergoes $15,000 Renovation
## 
### MARTHA OURIEFF 
White Memorial Fountain,
commonly known as "Mem Claw,"
will be under wraps for the next five
to seven weeks while it undergoes a
complete renovation by its creator,
San Francisco artist Aristides
Demetrios.
The project will cost about

$15,000, according to Dan DeYoung,
director of Plant Services.
The renovation of the fountain
involves opening the arms of the
sculpture and replacing the copper
tubing through which the water runs.
This tubing has become clogged and
corroded by chemicals in the water
and hair from animals that play in the
fountain. The new tubes will probably
also be made of copper, but with
plastic tubing inside so that in the
future, any clogged tubes will merely
require removal of the innertubes and
insertion of new ones.
"It'll be a hell of a job, even with
three people working on it,"
commented Demetrios. But, he said, it
will be "cheaper in the long run" than
continually repairing the faulty tubes.
Work on the claw will include a
considerable amount of arc welding. A
closed barricade is being constructed
around the fountain to protect
passers-by from the machines.
However, transparent covered
peep-holes may be cut into the
barricade so that people can observe
the construction.
Funds for the project will be drawn
from the endowment left by Raymond
White for the creation of White Plaza.
Along with the renovation of the
fountain, a special separate
maintenance budget is being
established for the plaza.
The reopening of the renovated
fountain will also mark the first day of
the second annual spring campus
clean-up.
