# Experience Offers Proof
## Faith Over Reason

(In response to "A Challenge to
Christian Religious Belief" by Bill
Evers, appearing in the Daily Jan. 9,
1974.)
In order to evaluate objectively his
position in existence, a man must try
to give up all a priori judgments. The
attempt to derive knowledge from the
void thus created seems to be the main
objective of modern analytic
philosophy and has become the central
problem of modern theology as well.
If he is to claim any non-subjective
validity for his beliefs, the Christian
must defend the source of his
knowledge as being beyond reproach.
Bill Evers is correct in assuming that
for evangelical Christians this source is
the Bible, but he deals inadequately
with the basic question: whether or
not Scripture is reliable.
The defense of Biblical inspiration
is two-fold. Primarily, the individual
must depend on subjective evidence,
e.g. the witness of the Spirit. But
Evers' objection that personal
revelation is insufficient justification
for making any type of absolute claims
is certainly valid. Thus it is necessary
to state the case for the verity of the
Bible in somewhat objective terms.
Primarily, Christian apologists
derive their arguments from history —
and feel the need to reconcile any
conflict between Christian belief and
the historical method. Lack of space
(and time and intellect) prevents me
from offering any more than an
outline of the basic method by which
this is accomplished. A fuller argument
is presented in Daniel P. Fuller's Easter
Faith and History (Grand Rapids:
William B. Eerdmans, 1965), from
which some of the following is taken.

booktable in White Plaza.
Analogy And Correlation
Important to an historical
interpretation of the Bible are two
principles of Ernst Troeltch: the
principle of analogy and the principle
of correlation. The former states that
we can make no judgment at all unless
we assume that past experiences are
not too greatly different from present.
The latter concludes that events in
time are not isolated but are related to
and interdependent with surrounding
events.
If these principles are valid, their
implications when applied to the Bible
should be examined. As Evers points
out, a number of questions thus arise.
First, if there is no such thing as
absolute knowledge from the historical
standpoint, how can absolute faith be
reconciled with historically uncertain
facts? Then, if one assumes the
principle of analogy, is it possible to
take one event (such as the
resurrection) as unique in occurrence
and importance? Lastly, can the idea
of miracles be entertained if one holds
that all events are inseparable from the
historical context in which they
occur?
In Festivals of the Jewish Year,
Theodor Gastor offers some comments
which clarify the relation between
history and the Bible:
Properly understood, the Seder
ceremony is no mere act of pious
recollection, but a unique and
inspired device for blending the
past, the present and the future
into a single comprehensive and
transcendental experience. The
actors in the story are not merely
the particular Israelites who happen

to have been led out of bondage by
Moses but all the generations of
Israel throughout all of time. In an
ideal sense, all Israel went forth out
of Egypt, and all Israel moved
through darkness to the presence of
God, in the wake of a pillar of fire.
Whenever the trumpets sound in
history, they sound for all ages; and
when the bell tolls the echo lives
forever.
Similar Attitudes
Thus, in many respects, a Jew
celebrating Passover is assuming the
same attitude as an historian. First, he
is taking the place of his ancestors,
taking their conditions and viewpoint
as his own. This he does, not in just
the Seder ceremony, but throughout
Jewish "ritual," from the Festival of
Booths to Hanukkah. He sees each
event as having an effect throughout
history.
But despite, or rather because of,
his use of an historical perspective the
Jew possesses intimate knowledge of
the exodus. He knows because he took
part in it. For him, the order and
interdependence of history does not
preclude the possibility of divine
intervention but rather shows that
God does work in the world. The
purpose and order are part of God's
plan.
It is in this context that Christians
should view the Bible — not as
something past, but as alive and
present. The believer escapes the
uncertainty of the historian because he
can experience the Bible first hand. If
the Holy Spirit did not exist, this
would not be possible. But if the
Christian is right in his belief that he
has within him that divine guide, it is
possible for him to understand what
an unaided man cannot.
Conflicts Disappear
With this understanding of the
Christian's relation to the Bible, the
conflicts between Christianity and the
assumptions of the historical method
seem to disappear. The existence of
God and a divine plan and the order
and interdependence of historical
events are mutually confirming. The
lack of absolute historical knowledge
does not prevent faith, it merely
confirms what we already know — that
we can never fully understand all the
implications of the Bible.
In their use of the historical
method, both the Christian and the
historian must take into account the
limits of reason. As Luigi Pirandello
says in Six Characters in Search of an
Author, "there are a great many things
in the world that don't even need to
appear possible because they are true."
Thus an event, no matter how
improbable it may seem to a historian,
need only occur for it to be true. In
the end, experience must transcend
reason.

should view the Bible — not as
something past, but as alive and
present. The believer escapes the
uncertainty of the historian because he
can experience the Bible first hand. If
the Holy Spirit did not exist, this
would not be possible. But if the
Christian is right in his belief that he
has within him that divine guide, it is
possible for him to understand what
an unaided man cannot.
Conflicts Disappear
With this understanding of the
Christian's relation to the Bible, the
conflicts between Christianity and the
assumptions of the historical method
seem to disappear. The existence of
God and a divine plan and the order
and interdependence of historical
events are mutually confirming. The
lack of absolute historical knowledge
does not prevent faith, it merely
confirms what we already know — that
we can never fully understand all the
implications of the Bible.
In their use of the historical
method, both the Christian and the
historian must take into account the
limits of reason. As Luigi Pirandello
says in Six Characters in Search of an
Author, "there are a great many things
in the world that don't even need to
appear possible because they are true."
Thus an event, no matter how
improbable it may seem to a historian,
need only occur for it to be true. In
the end, experience must transcend
reason.

In order to evaluate objectively his
position in existence, a man must try
to give up all a priori judgments. The
attempt to derive knowledge from the
void thus created seems to be the main
objective of modern analytic
philosophy and has become the central
problem of modern theology as well.
If he is to claim any non-subjective
validity for his beliefs, the Christian
must defend the source of his
knowledge as being beyond reproach.
Bill Evers is correct in assuming that
for evangelical Christians this source is
the Bible, but he deals inadequately
with the basic question: whether or
not Scripture is reliable.
The defense of Biblical inspiration
is two-fold. Primarily, the individual
must depend on subjective evidence,
e.g. the witness of the Spirit. But
Evers' objection that personal
revelation is insufficient justification
for making any type of absolute claims
is certainly valid. Thus it is necessary
to state the case for the verity of the
Bible in somewhat objective terms.
Primarily, Christian apologists
derive their arguments from history —
and feel the need to reconcile any
conflict between Christian belief and
the historical method. Lack of space
(and time and intellect) prevents me
from offering any more than an
outline of the basic method by which
this is accomplished. A fuller argument
is presented in Daniel P. Fuller's Easter
Faith and History (Grand Rapids:
William B. Eerdmans, 1965), from
which some of the following is taken.

Analogy And Correlation
Important to an historical
interpretation of the Bible are two
principles of Ernst Troeltch: the
principle of analogy and the principle
of correlation. The former states that
we can make no judgment at all unless
we assume that past experiences are
not too greatly different from present.
The latter concludes that events in
time are not isolated but are related to
and interdependent with surrounding
events.
If these principles are valid, their
implications when applied to the Bible
should be examined. As Evers points
out, a number of questions thus arise.
First, if there is no such thing as
absolute knowledge from the historical
standpoint, how can absolute faith be
reconciled with historically uncertain
facts? Then, if one assumes the
principle of analogy, is it possible to
take one event (such as the
resurrection) as unique in occurrence
and importance? Lastly, can the idea
of miracles be entertained if one holds
that all events are inseparable from the
historical context in which they
occur?
In Festivals of the Jewish Year,
Theodor Gastor offers some comments
which clarify the relation between
history and the Bible:
Properly understood, the Seder
ceremony is no mere act of pious
recollection, but a unique and
inspired device for blending the
past, the present and the future
into a single comprehensive and
transcendental experience. The
actors in the story are not merely
the particular Israelites who happen

to have been led out of bondage by
Moses but all the generations of
Israel throughout all of time. In an
ideal sense, all Israel went forth out
of Egypt, and all Israel moved
through darkness to the presence of
God, in the wake of a pillar of fire.
Whenever the trumpets sound in
history, they sound for all ages; and
when the bell tolls the echo lives
forever.
Similar Attitudes
Thus, in many respects, a Jew
celebrating Passover is assuming the
same attitude as an historian. First, he
is taking the place of his ancestors,
taking their conditions and viewpoint
as his own. This he does, not in just
the Seder ceremony, but throughout
Jewish "ritual," from the Festival of
Booths to Hanukkah. He sees each
event as having an effect throughout
history.
But despite, or rather because of,
his use of an historical perspective the
Jew possesses intimate knowledge of
the exodus. He knows because he took
part in it. For him, the order and
interdependence of history does not
preclude the possibility of divine
intervention but rather shows that
God does work in the world. The
purpose and order are part of God's
plan.
It is in this context that Christians
should view the Bible — not as
something past, but as alive and
present. The believer escapes the
uncertainty of the historian because he

transcendental experience. The
actors in the story are not merely
the particular Israelites who happen

to have been led out of bondage by
Moses but all the generations of
Israel throughout all of time. In an
ideal sense, all Israel went forth out
of Egypt, and all Israel moved
through darkness to the presence of
God, in the wake of a pillar of fire.
Whenever the trumpets sound in
history, they sound for all ages; and
when the bell tolls the echo lives
forever.
Similar Attitudes
Thus, in many respects, a Jew
celebrating Passover is assuming the
same attitude as an historian. First, he
is taking the place of his ancestors,
taking their conditions and viewpoint
as his own. This he does, not in just
the Seder ceremony, but throughout
Jewish "ritual," from the Festival of
Booths to Hanukkah. He sees each
event as having an effect throughout
history.
But despite, or rather because of,
his use of an historical perspective the
Jew possesses intimate knowledge of
the exodus. He knows because he took
part in it. For him, the order and
interdependence of history does not
preclude the possibility of divine
intervention but rather shows that
God does work in the world. The
purpose and order are part of God's
plan.
It is in this context that Christians
should view the Bible — not as
something past, but as alive and
present. The believer escapes the
uncertainty of the historian because he
can experience the Bible first hand. If
the Holy Spirit did not exist, this
would not be possible. But if the
Christian is right in his belief that he
has within him that divine guide, it is
possible for him to understand what
an unaided man cannot.
Conflicts Disappear
With this understanding of the
Christian's relation to the Bible, the
conflicts between Christianity and the
assumptions of the historical method
seem to disappear. The existence of
God and a divine plan and the order
and interdependence of historical
events are mutually confirming. The
lack of absolute historical knowledge
does not prevent faith, it merely
confirms what we already know — that
we can never fully understand all the
implications of the Bible.
In their use of the historical
method, both the Christian and the
historian must take into account the
limits of reason. As Luigi Pirandello
says in Six Characters in Search of an
Author, "there are a great many things
in the world that don't even need to
appear possible because they are true."
Thus an event, no matter how
improbable it may seem to a historian,
need only occur for it to be true. In
the end, experience must transcend
reason.

Christian Religious Belief" by Bill
Evers, appearing in the Daily Jan. 9,
1974.)
In order to evaluate objectively his
position in existence, a man must try
to give up all a priori judgments. The
attempt to derive knowledge from the
void thus created seems to be the main
objective of modern analytic
philosophy and has become the central
problem of modern theology as well.
If he is to claim any non-subjective
validity for his beliefs, the Christian
must defend the source of his
knowledge as being beyond reproach.
Bill Evers is correct in assuming that
for evangelical Christians this source is
the Bible, but he deals inadequately
with the basic question: whether or
not Scripture is reliable.
The defense of Biblical inspiration
is two-fold. Primarily, the individual
must depend on subjective evidence,
e.g. the witness of the Spirit. But
Evers' objection that personal
revelation is insufficient justification
for making any type of absolute claims
is certainly valid. Thus it is necessary
to state the case for the verity of the
Bible in somewhat objective terms.
Primarily, Christian apologists
derive their arguments from history —
and feel the need to reconcile any
conflict between Christian belief and
the historical method. Lack of space
(and time and intellect) prevents me
from offering any more than an
outline of the basic method by which
this is accomplished. A fuller argument
is presented in Daniel P. Fuller's Easter
Faith and History (Grand Rapids:
William B. Eerdmans, 1965), from
which some of the following is taken.

Analogy And Correlation
Important to an historical
interpretation of the Bible are two
principles of Ernst Troeltch: the
principle of analogy and the principle
of correlation. The former states that
we can make no judgment at all unless
we assume that past experiences are
not too greatly different from present.
The latter concludes that events in
time are not isolated but are related to
and interdependent with surrounding
events.
If these principles are valid, their
implications when applied to the Bible
should be examined. As Evers points
out, a number of questions thus arise.
First, if there is no such thing as
absolute knowledge from the historical
standpoint, how can absolute faith be
reconciled with historically uncertain
facts? Then, if one assumes the
principle of analogy, is it possible to
take one event (such as the
resurrection) as unique in occurrence
and importance? Lastly, can the idea
of miracles be entertained if one holds
that all events are inseparable from the
historical context in which they
occur?
In Festivals of the Jewish Year,
Theodor Gastor offers some comments
which clarify the relation between
history and the Bible:
Properly understood, the Seder
ceremony is no mere act of pious
recollection, but a unique and
inspired device for blending the
past, the present and the future
into a single comprehensive and
transcendental experience. The
actors in the story are not merely
the particular Israelites who happen

to have been led out of bondage by
Moses but all the generations of
Israel throughout all of time. In an
