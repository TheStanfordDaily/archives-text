# The 						Burden Of Free Speech
## William Shockley And His Opponents 
###

Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley
completed another of his celebrated speaking tours
on race and intelligence last month. All concerned
seemed hell-bent on outdoing each other in rank
foolishness.
By his very appearance on a scene, Prof.
Shockley seems to engender a shortage of clear
thinking, possibly by sheer force of example. When
he hits the Chautaqua circuit — as he does often,
and with unscholarly glee — reason flies in his path.
It is a discredit to his critics, with whom we could
otherwise not agree more.
A stirring defense of Prof. Shockley is not the
sort of piece to win friends for a reporter on this
campus. The professor's work in what he calls
"dysgenics" is mired in professional scom; most
geneticists agree with the seven members of the
National Academy of Sciences who called his efforts
marked by "such simplistic notions of race,
intelligence, and 'human quality' as to be unworthy
of consideration by a body of scientists." His
vaunted suggestion that blacks, because they are (in
his words) "genetically inferior," should receive
cash incentives for sterilization is, indeed, genocidal,
and repugnant to a well-developed appreciation of
civil liberties.
Ass And Seer
Nor is Prof. Shockley the sort to inspire
confidence or sympathy by sheer charisma. His
insistence on tape-recording every word spoken to
or by him is enough to unnerve the most jaded
observer of human behavior. His penchant for
bestowing immense packages of public-relations
material on the unwilling press has led the less
tolerant to brand him a mere crackpot.
But what many of this curious man's critics seem
to have forgotten is that the First Amendment
protects the ass as well as the seer. Giving Prof.
Shockley his say — which does not, of course,
include encouraging it — is merely one of the
burdens of what liberty we still have.

Those who disrupted Prof. Shockley's classes on
this campus some years ago did so in favor of tighter
University restrictions on who may teach and what
they may say. That is a curiously shortsighted
policy, especially for radicals — who have no reason
on earth to confide in the University's 'liberality' —
and especially on this campus, where only the
thinnest thread of bourgeois liberalism saved the
brilliant Marxist economist Paul Baran from being
fired (and failed to spare Bruce Franklin the same
fate).
Martyrdom
The absolute freedom of speech promised by the
First Amendment is, and always will be, the
radical's best friend. That it is also Prof. Shockley's
best friend is no reason to throw the baby out with
the bathwater.
When Prof. Shockley was prevented from
speaking at Columbia and Harvard, it made him into
something he may not deserve to be: a martyr to
the cause of liberty. As a result, his foolish theories,
which otherwise might have easily succumbed to the
attack of reason, took on the stature of serious
ideas; his racialism took on the stature of embattled,
but scholarly, eccentricity; and his rather dull
lectures on the ludicrous "three moral postulates"
were taken seriously by a great number of people
who should have known better.
More zealous critics of Prof. Shockley will
protest that his apparent support among the bearers
of American racism propelled the roving engineer to
stardom, and that forceful opposition (i.e.,
disruption) is a necessary counter to the ruling
racism.
Racism
But Prof. Shockley's earnest efforts have resulted
in no legislation or mass movement; the hoary
pseudoscience of eugenics has little real chance of
becoming social policy in its present reincarnation.
Nor should the attention paid to Shockley be
ascribed at every turn to the racism that is still a

virulent strain in American life.
When the waspish gentlemen of Princeton's
Whig-Clio Society fell all over themselves inviting
Shockley to speak at their Tory sanctum, it
confirmed the suspicions of many about Princeton.
But the national press, conspiracy theories aside,
was hardly driven to the scene by its
barely-suppressed redneck nature. No, it was the
wild spectacle of a slightly dotty professor being
chased the length of the Ivy League by the hounds
of 'liberal' academic orthodoxy that attracted the
reporters and cameramen. The outcome was more
theater than scholarship, but it gave Shockley's
message unmerited publicity.
If repression is counterproductive, what, then,
are Shockley's opponents to do? The answer is not,
as some have argued, to ignore him; that way lies
only cowardly passivity in the face of repugnant
ideas. Instead, it still falls to Shockley's opponents
to expose hifn .to counter his unreason with reason
at every turi, and to ensure that his arguments go
nowhere unanswered. Without the publicity of
disruption, Shockley will be left to academic
audiences, who already find it difficult to take him
seriously.
There are many fronts in the struggle for black
liberation . on some of them the ideal of 'rational
debate' has been closed off by the forces of racism,
and there the tactics of direct action are appropriate
and effective. In Shockley's case they are neither.
The apostle of 'dysgenics' has chosen the way of
rational debate himself; he should be left to it, for
so left he will simply fade away. Otherwise, he will
continue to divert the attention and energies of the
oppressed from the real problem, which is the
subtle, institutional racism that pervades American
society, not a few noisy fringe characters. In any
case, the man and his theories are hardly worth
more blows against our few remaining liberties.
