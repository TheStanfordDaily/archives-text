# Mr. Chang: Watchman Living On 15 Cents A Day
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Mr. Chang shuffles through the
Main Library, his stockingless feet
slipping out of his old, cracked shoes.
He seems to walk without moving his
legs, his trousers are so loose. An
enormous white laboratory smock
droops from his 4'10" frame.
For 24 years, Mr. Chang, now in his
seventies, has never missed a night's 10
o'clock lock-up. After he puts the
library to bed, he hustles back to the
place he calls home, the physics
department. There, he keeps the rest
of his nightly vigil.
"He knows the people over here
better than anyone else," says David
Haskin, administrative officer of the
physics department. In fact, Mr. Chang
can blitz through the names of all the
physics professors and when they
taught, and of students and their class
rankings.
Mr. Chung-Kuei Chang came here
from the faculty of Peking University
on a China Foundation research

scholarship in 1937. In one way or
another, his life has revolved around
the physics department ever since.
Numerous Jobs
His jobs have descended "down the
scale" from researcher, to lab
technician at Hansen Labs, to
watchman, says Alan Grundmann,
former administrative director of the
department. However, a good
indication that Mr. Chang belongs to
the department as much today as ever
before is a booksheld in the library
stacked with heavy tomes and labeled
"Mr. Chang's Shelf."
Although his jobs have become less
prestigious, his power, ironically, has
increased. As watchman, he holds the
key to every lock in the building. He
roves the premises like an emperor
strolling through gardens. Haskins calls
him affectionately, "our old retainer."
The set up is almost feudal.
Grundmann explains, "Mr. Chang's
lord is the physics department, and the
physics department, in turn, protests

and takes care of him. It's quite an
unusual case of responsibility."
For example, the stock room
keeper and several secretaries do his
shopping. Ruth Running, physics
library specialist, says she occasionally
brings him bananas and takes him to
the bank.
Simple Needs
"He asks precious little,"
Grundmann says. "His needs are
simple, and he is paid only a fraction
of a salary" — not much more than
$100 per month.
Mr. Chang lives on 15 cents a day.
He spends not more than $10 a month
for food. "I eat bread, cabbage and
peanut butter," he says cheerfully. He
is frail, but healthy. His skin is
youthful, and his big, buck-teeth are
white. "I've never been sick, not one
day,"he says proudly.
With penny-pinching that would
appal even his idol Ben Franklin, Mr.
Chang has made a coca-cola last for
three days, saving it for "a little

inspiration" he says. Once he chocked
the department refrigerators full of
peanut butter, because he says he
could buy a gigantic case for "such a
good price." He even removes
unnecessary coils from a small electric
heater in his room to save a few
kilowatts.
'Matter Of Principle'
"To him, it's a matter of principle
to live like a poor Chinese," Haskins
explains. "He's virtually possessionless.
He has very few clothes and wears
them continuously."
Mr. Chang could certainly afford to
live better. He has amassed a sizeable
fortune by saving his meager salaries.
Mr. Chang explains, "The more
money I have, the less I spend. When I
was a young man, I used to spend
about 30 cents a day on food. I would
drink maybe two cokes each dav —
that was when they cost only five
cents."
With fatherly foresight verging on
parsimony, he has sent just enough

money to his family in mainland China
for them to survive — maybe 50
dollars a quarter. He wants to save
them from the laziness which spoiled
his uncles back in their profligate,
opium-smoking days before the
revolution. As if to spite the memory,
Mr. Chang draws a coarse paper towel
from his pocket and roughly wipes his
nose.
Ascetic Life
Mr. Chang has led an ascetic but
useful life. He says, "I'm a rich man. I
don't have to work. But I'd rather
work. This is my duty, my
contribution." He grins
self-consciously, "I don't think
anybody could do a better job than I
do."
Mr. Chang is pleased with himself.
He has spent his whole life pleasing
just himself — never kowtowing to
those in the academic world. For
example, he never finished his Ph.D. in
either electrical engineering or physics.
Mr. Chang explains, "I quit without

saying anything. 1 am not interested in
the degree. I am interested in learning
for myself. In China, the best scholars
don't have degrees."
Haskin says, "It's possible he knows
as much about some fields of physics
as anybody." Grundmann cautions,
"However he's never done anything to
demonstrate he has assimilated it all."
Looks At Mail
Mr. Chang sifts through each day's
mail looking for the latest physics
journals. Running says that he reads
voraciously. Grundmann reports that
when he was once honored to visit Mr.
Chang's office, it had "the biggest pile
of stuff you've ever seen. He had
physics reprints in great stacks on an
old cot."
Whether Mr. Chang is a muted
genius is a moot question. But there is
no doubt he has photographic
memory. "He's a walking reference
system," says Grundmann. He has
nearly memorized the voluminous
