# 'The Highest Religion Is Truthâ€™
## Individual Perception Develops Faith 
### 
Tim Knaak

Whatever one may think of the
validity and scope of Bill Evers'
arguments against traditional Christian
beliefs (Opinion, 1-9), they do show
independent thought. In this sense
Professor Cohn's charge of "dreary
mediocrity" (Letters, 1-11) is unfair.
It would be mediocre to accept a
belief in God or theology merely
because the church or some renowned
philosopher does. There is a place for
faith, but it must be a reasonable one
and one developed by the individual
perception of the believer, not
imposed by authority.
Moreover, correct perception of
ultimate mysteries is less important for
the moment than the more immediate
problems facing humanity. Persons of
many different theoretical persuasions,
including atheists, have done much in
this regard and Evers cannot be
slighted as unconcerned with current
social problems, as his other articles

show. Indeed, the socially-conscious
atheist shows a more spontaneous,
unselfish motivation for social causes
by clearly not involving the glamor of
heaven or fear of hell with right
action.
Besides, the questions raised by Mr.
Evers are serious ones. Some Eastern
thinkers are driven similarly to
conclude that one can never really
name or fully describe that in which
all things exist. Western theology also
states that the finite mind cannot
comprehend the Infinite.
This word "infinity" is easy to say
but almost impossible to grasp. The
mathematician defines it in a manner
similar to the Buddhist formula
"beyond all beyonds." But who
really understands it? We are put in
the same bind regarding materialist
theories of the creation as Evers
mentions for the Creator idea. There
must be a cause beyond the so-called
"Big Bang" theory and one beyond
that and.... Some philosophers
reject the idea of an infinite regression,
but what would this do to
mathematics? We cannot live with it
and we cannot live without it.
Immanent and Transcendent
God is both immanent and
transcendent. Of course, there really is
no existence apart from that One
which fills all space, both physical and
spiritual, immediate and efficient
Cause. The circle makes infinity easier
to grasp. Remember that the One is
both Alpha and Omega, beginning and
end. Circular reasoning may be invalid,
but that does not destroy any circles
you see. I will claim spiritual circles
are as valid as physical ones and even
"invalid" mental ones are still there.
So the materialist does us a favor
by pointing out the inadequacy of
Medieval theological notions for the
world of today. The materialist has
correctly questioned the conceited
assumption that the earth is the center
of creation and humanity the major
concern of . . . well, of something the
materialist cannot conceive of in his or
her haughty presumption that human
beings are the only conscious entities,
or at least the most conscious and
intelligent ones of this planet.
The materialist will argue that the
latter assumption is more reasonable in
view of the tangible evidence. Unless
one trusts one's ability to discriminate
between the dreamy mysticism Evers
complains about and real spiritual
insight, this is so.
Inventions Revise Theories
Last century materialist physics
thought everything was taken care of
in its explanation of the universe and
then along came x-rays, radioactivity,
quantum theory and relativity. Now
some physicists are talking again as if
the Big Picture were finally coming
into view. Do you believe that? One
actually has to argue with some people
that a physical-mechanical description
is insufficient to explain
consciousness. Perhaps some people
are different, but let's assume others
really do perceive things, make choices
and say things with meaning behind
them.
Or perhaps some form of
consciousness and even will is inherent
in every form of existence, even as
motion is. The Greeks saw a similarity
between man the microcosm and the
Great Man of the macrocosm (maybe a
Great Woman, more probably beyond
such distinctions). The analogy may
seem just poetic or even puerile, but I
think it points to a great fact of
existence, of wheels within wheels,
lesser beings within greater. The
greater is much more powerful than
the lesser surely, but not necessarily
omnipotent. The earth has its karma
also, but has evolved both physically

and spiritually far beyond the "cells"
of its body, so far in fact that physical
expression means little more to It than
giving of itself that smaller lives may
grow.
The theosophists also speak of a
Hierarchy of superhumans who make
no big splash in our history because
this is their high purpose: that we may
grow by our own efforts to be as they,
conscious of each other and of those
beyond us. The Hindus say that divine
Avatars appear from time to time to
guide us. If they do, if the new
teaching of a Christ or Buddha bring
such divine ideas, the rest is still the
result of human memory, exposition
and interpretation, which may be good
or bad, a groping towards the light
that higher beings see clearly. This is

only an hypothesis now, but one
important enough to think about.
Perhaps the ideas of any group,
whether aborigines who believe in a
Spirit of the Yarth, or students who
question outworn theologies, deserve
consideration. The negative view is
that all religions are illusory, the
positive view that any system of
thought holds seeds which, if correctly
understood, are enlightening. The
Vedas say: "The highest religion is
Truth." As long as we remain true to
ourselves, believe what is real and take
those actions which enlightened reason
dictates, that Truth will keep
unfolding, synthesizing the many
lesser truths.
