Scandalous, Tragic Article
Editor:
For those of us who dare to hope
that a lasting settlement of the Middle
East conflict will emerge from the
current talks in Geneva, an article that
appeared recently in the influential
Cairo weekly, Akher Saa, gives cause
for renewed pessimism. On Nov. 28,
1973 Akher Saa (as reported by the
Hebrew daily Maariv, Dec. 14, 1973)
published a play entitled "The
Tragedy of the Good Father Toma"
which, in reality, is only a thinly veiled
rehash of the famous Damascus blood
libel charge of 1840.
The blood libel charge, which first
arose in twelfth century Germany and
England and was most recently
depicted in Bernard Malamud's The
Fixer, represents the most virulent
kind of anti-semitism. Although there
are a large number of grotesque
variations, the basic blood libel accuses
the Jews of the given community of
murdering (often ritually) innocent
Christians (often children) in order to
use their blood for secret cultic
purposes.
In the Damascus—lB4o version the
Jews of Damascus were accused of
killing the Christian monk Tomaso and
his Muslim servant Ibrahim and of
using their blood to make unleavened
bread for Passover.
After many Jews, including 63
children, were imprisoned on the
charge and the world Jewish
community was aroused, the British

government intervened with the Sultan
to obtain their release, and the vicious
charges were dropped. The
Cairo—l 973 dramatic version, set in
Damascus in 1840 and complete with
pictures of the "blood-thirsty" Jews,
also has the Jews using blood for
circumcision rites.
That such an incredible account
could find a place in any respected
journal in the twentieth century is
scandalous. That it should appear in an
important journal in the leading Arab
nation represented at the Geneva
peace talks is tragic. The play presents
Jews as sub-human creatures of Satan
capable of the most unspeakable
crimes. Against such creatures all
punishments are permitted. Indeed,
the massacre and mutilation of Israeli
prisoners of war by Syrian soldiers is a
"punishment" which may well
proceed from such a distorted, warped
mind-set.
The revival of the blood libel hardly
seems designed to prepare the
Egyptian people for peace with their
Israeli neighbors. I trust that such an
article does not represent .the
sentiments of the Egyptian
government. In a nation with a free
press (which, unfortunately, Egypt is
not), the article would not be so
interpreted. Nonetheless, we optimists
would do well to remember the words
of the prophet Jeremiah who
cautioned against those who cry
"peace, peace, when there is no
peace."
