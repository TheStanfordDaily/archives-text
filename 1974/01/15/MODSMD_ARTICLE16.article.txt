For its first event of the winter quarter, the Office of Public

in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The performers are Robert Mann, first violinist, who has been
the Quartet's guiding light for 20 years; Earl Carlyss, second
violinist, former concert master of the New York City Ballet
Orchestra; Samuel Rhodes, violist, formerly with the Marlboro
Music Festival; and Claus Adam, cellist, composer, and former
member of the New Music Quartet.
The program consists of Mozart's Quartet in C major, K. 465
("Dissonant") (1785); the Northern California premiere of Elliott
Carter's String Quartet No. 3 (1971); and Debussy's Quartet in G
minor, Opus 10 (1893).
Since the Juilliard began its activities in 1946, its repertoire
has included more than 375 works, ranging from Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven, and Schubert to Bartok, Webern, Schoenberg, and
Ginastera.
