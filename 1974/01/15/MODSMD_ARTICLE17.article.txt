# ‘The Way We Were'
## Redford, Streisand Strengthen Film 
### DAN FORTE 
Can a handsome, All-American
WASP-jock who happens to be a
talented, sensitive writer find
happiness with an ugly-duckling
New York Jew who happens to be
president of the Young
Communist League?
If this sounds more than
slightly like another Love Story,
hang on, it's not. The Way We
Were stars Robert Redford as the
good-looking, athletic Hubbel
Gardiner, and Barbara Streisand as
political activist Katie Moranski.
Producer Ray Stark and
director Sidney Pollack have
succeeded in transforming Arthur
Laurents' novel into a deeply
moving, neatly packaged film.
The film deals in part, but not
entirely, with the Hollywood
blacklist era of the early 50s.
Unfortunately, this segment, only
a part of the two decades covered,
is handled less realistically and
shallower than the earlier scenes.
Atmosphere Not Recreated
The actual "witch hunt"
atmosphere which the House
Committee on Unamerican
Activities provided during that
time does not come to the
surface.
The House Committee's
hearings, and the Red panic from
which they arose, were not unlike
the Salem witch trials in The
Crucible by Arthur Miller, who,
by the way, was among those
questioned by the committee.
The late Edward G. Robinson
described in his autobiography his
experiences with the committee:
"What they wanted me to say was
that I was a dupe, a sucker, a fool,

an idiot, that I'd been
double-crossed, that everything I
believed in was negated by the
clubs to which I belonged — that I
was a tool, an unsuspecting agent
of the Communist conspiracy."
After two years without any
acting jobs, he finally said what
the Committee wanted to hear,
although he still didn't believe it.
"My defenses were down and I
said it. My judgment was warped
and I said it. My heart was sick
and I said it."
Flashbacks Most Enjoyable
The most enjoyable scenes in
The Way We were are the
flashbacks; from 1937, when
Hubbel and Katie are graduating
from a New York college, to
1941, when they are reunited.

Hubbel is best described by a
line from his first short story, The
All-American Smile: "Everything
came too easily to him.. .."
As the film progresses, this
characterization gradually
deteriorates until we see Hubbel
selling out to Hollywood and
cheating on his wife (Streisand)
with his college flame (played by
Lois Chiles).
On the other hand, Katie
remains a constant, or near
constant, throughout. As Hubbel
says in both the beginning and
end of the movie, "You never
quit, do you?"
Good Casting
Redford, who is perhaps the
most prolific actor in the business,
starring in three films released this

year alone, couldn't have been a
better choice for the part of
Hubbel.
Streisand not only comes up
with her best performance to
date, but also sings the beautiful
theme song, written by Marvin
Hamlisch, which is her best
musical effort since "People."
She was also more exotically
attractive than ever in her 1940ish
fashions, and may stand a chance
to pick up her second Oscar.
Special attention should be
given to the timing of the
different scenes. Everything was
short and concise, so as not to
become boring or irritating, and
the whole thing held together
well.

succeeded in transforming Arthur
Laurents' novel into a deeply
moving, neatly packaged film.
The film deals in part, but not
entirely, with the Hollywood
blacklist era of the early 50s.
Unfortunately, this segment, only
a part of the two decades covered,
is handled less realistically and
shallower than the earlier scenes.
Atmosphere Not Recreated
The actual "witch hunt"
atmosphere which the House
Committee on Unamerican
Activities provided during that
time does not come to the
surface.
The House Committee's
hearings, and the Red panic from
which they arose, were not unlike
the Salem witch trials in The
Crucible by Arthur Miller, who,
by the way, was among those
questioned by the committee.
The late Edward G. Robinson
described in his autobiography his
experiences with the committee:
"What they wanted me to say was
that I was a dupe, a sucker, a fool,

an idiot, that I'd been
double-crossed, that everything I
believed in was negated by the
clubs to which I belonged — that I
was a tool, an unsuspecting agent
of the Communist conspiracy."
After two years without any
acting jobs, he finally said what
the Committee wanted to hear,
although he still didn't believe it.
"My defenses were down and I
said it. My judgment was warped
and I said it. My heart was sick
and I said it."
Flashbacks Most Enjoyable
The most enjoyable scenes in
The Way We were are the
flashbacks; from 1937, when
Hubbel and Katie are graduating
from a New York college, to
1941, when they are reunited.

Hubbel is best described by a
line from his first short story, The
All-American Smile: "Everything
came too easily to him.. .."
As the film progresses, this
characterization gradually
deteriorates until we see Hubbel
selling out to Hollywood and
cheating on his wife (Streisand)
with his college flame (played by
Lois Chiles).
On the other hand, Katie
remains a constant, or near
constant, throughout. As Hubbel
says in both the beginning and
end of the movie, "You never
quit, do you?"
Good Casting
Redford, who is perhaps the
most prolific actor in the business,
starring in three films released this

year alone, couldn't have been a
better choice for the part of
Hubbel.
Streisand not only comes up
with her best performance to
date, but also sings the beautiful
theme song, written by Marvin
Hamlisch, which is her best
musical effort since "People."
She was also more exotically
attractive than ever in her 1940ish
fashions, and may stand a chance
to pick up her second Oscar.
Special attention should be
given to the timing of the
different scenes. Everything was
short and concise, so as not to
become boring or irritating, and
the whole thing held together
well.
Can a handsome, All-American
WASP-jock who happens to be a
talented, sensitive writer find
happiness with an ugly-duckling
New York Jew who happens to be
president of the Young
Communist League?
If this sounds more than
slightly like another Love Story,
hang on, it's not. The Way We
Were stars Robert Redford as the
good-looking, athletic Hubbel
Gardiner, and Barbara Streisand as
political activist Katie Moranski.
Producer Ray Stark and
director Sidney Pollack have
succeeded in transforming Arthur
Laurents' novel into a deeply
moving, neatly packaged film.
