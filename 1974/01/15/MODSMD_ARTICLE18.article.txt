# Freedom, Humor Mark Creations Of Murray Louis Dance Company

### JANICE ROSS 
BERKELEY — Twenty-seven years ago Murray
Louis left San Francisco for New York City,
believing that it was too difficult to create art in
beautiful surroundings. Wednesday night in U.C.
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium the Murray Louis
Dance Company presented an example of the
beautiful dance that flourishes, with his help, in the
drab environment of New York.
After leaving California, Louis soon became
principal dancer with Alwin Nikolais' company. He
has since become an independent choreographer
with his own company, still continuing a close
artistic association with Nikolais.
Although Nikolais' influence was apparent in
much of Louis' choreography Wednesday night, so
too was Louis' very personal brand of humor While
Nikolais is often accused of making his dancers
subservient to technical effects, Louis retains his
own choreographic humor and integrity regardless
of whether he is working in Nikolais' idiom or his
own.
Wednesday's concert opened with a preview of
Porcelain Dialogues, set to Tchaikovsky's First
String Quartet. Despite a technically uneven
performance by the six member company, due in
part to the newness of the piece, Louis' masterful
handling of time and his flair for movement design
were clearly in evidence. Singly or in groups of twos
or threes the dancers easily shifted from one
sculptural arrangement to another on an easy breath
impulse. Louis is concerned with space as "unity of
molecular activity"; he sees his dancers as forms
that give shape and consequently reality to the
invisibleness of empty volume. Both the space
occupied by the dancer and the space surrounding
him are of equal importance in Louis' conception of
form.
Timing to Louis is a sensory process of knowing
just how to achieve a perfect balance between stasis
and motion. In Porcelain Dialogues this sense is

refined to an art. Nikolais provided the pale lighting
and color projections which further enhance the
careful design and delicacy of the movements.
Nikolais also designed the lighting for Louis'
second offering, a whimsical dance for seven
entitled Index to necessary neuroses. . . (1973).
The movement alternates between grotesque and
fanciful, a menacing head thrust suddenly dissolves
into a silly grin; one martial line of dancers
confronts another and both break into laughter. It is
precisely this knack of doing the unexpected that
makes Louis' choreography so much fun to watch.
In Index Louis has three solo sequences, the best
involving a series of scratching ape-like gestures in
which Louis demonstrates his extraordinary skill for
mime. The entire dance is a succession of images
like these; eccentric solos alternate with lyric trios,
against a continually changing background tableau
of lights and music.
Hoopla (1972), the third and final piece, was a
farcical circus dance. The acts included trapeze
artists, magicians and even a timid lion tamer
(delightfully danced by Louis) who struggled with a
hydra-headed elastic worm (an obvious satirical
reference to Nikolais). Hoopla is one of those light
dances in which both the audience and the
performers can relax and enjoy themselves. The
music was traditional circus music performed by the
Lisbon State Police Band, and the minute it began,
even before the curtain was up, the atmosphere was
vibrant. Hoopb is a real spectacle; it is ordered and
well-planned to give the audience a total theatre
experience that is at once environmental and
objective.
It is clear that Louis has rejected the idea of
over-structuring dance. He has tried to avoid
weighting down a dance with too many theatrical
crutches (elaborate lighting, costumes, special
affects, etc.). His dances today are exhilirating
and free. As he recently explained, "To me dancing
is like cooking — good fresh vegetables can stand by
themselves."
