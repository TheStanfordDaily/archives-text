Egypt Counters Kissinger's Plan
ASWAN, Egypt — Egypt rejected parts of Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger's troop pullback plan for the Suez
front yesterday and gave him counterproposals an Egyptian
spokesman called "the first step toward peace."
Kissinger said, "The gap has been substantially
narrowed."
Kissinger's comment was made in a statement read by
U.S. Ambassador Hermann Eilts, as the secretary of state
flew to Jerusalem for another session with Israeli officials.
Eilts said Kissinger, who met with Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat for Vh hours last night, was expected back in
Aswan within the next couple of days in hopes that the
"gap will be narrowed further."
In Jerusalem, the Israelis announced that today's
meeting of the Arab and Israeli military delegations, which
have been negotiating troop pullbacks in Geneva, was
canceled at the request of the Egyptians.
State No-Knock Law Proposed
SACRAMENTO - California would get its own "no
knock" law under legislation introduced yesterday.
Assemblyman Robert McLennan (R-Downey),
introduced the bill giving law enforcement officers the right
to enter a person's home without knocking first if they
have a judge's warrant okaying the action.
McLennan said his bill was in response to a recent
California Supreme Court ruling that judges issue warrants
giving officers permission to enter a home without
knocking.
Candidate Reply Right Considered
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed yesterday
to consider whether states may force newspapers to print
editorial replies from political candidates.
The justices will hear arguments late; this term on the
constitutionality of Florida's right-to-reply law, which
grants candidates access to newspapers that "assail" the
candidate's record or character.
The Florida Supreme Court upheld the law, finding that
it enhanced freedom of speech in pursuit of free and fair
elections. The Miami Herald appealed the decision, and
several major news and civil liberties organizations called
the ruling a major and unprecedented violation of the First
Amendment.
Simon, Nader Oil Testimonies Clash
WASHINGTON — Federal Energy Director William E.
Simon told Congress yesterday the nation is threatened
with "dangerously low levels" of petroleum products, but
consumer advocate Ralph Nader said the world is

"drowning in oil."
Their sharply conflicting views were presented in
testimony before a House-Senate economic subcommittee
looking into the accuracy of government energy statistics.
"While many doubt the accuracy of the data being
provided by industry," said Simon, "there is no doubt in
my mind that we do indeed have a serious shortage.
"As of Dec. 29, the American Petroleum Institute
reported we have only slightly over 30 days' supply of the
major petroleum products. The shortage caused by a full
effective embargo will quickly reduce these to dangerously
low levels unless we act quickly to reduce demand and
equitably allocate the available supplies," he said.
Nader described America's energy problem as "unarmed
robbery by oil companies in collusion with government
support." Denying an energy shortage exists, he said,
everything that has happened in the name of the energy
crisis has been to the advantage of the major petroleum
companies.
"The world is literally drowning in oil," Nader said.
"Any government agency can create a shortage simply by
announcing it."
Energy Office Issues New Rules
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office (FEO)
issued regulations last night that in effect will force owners
of oil-heated residences to lower their thermostats six
degrees and leave gasoline stations last in line for available
supplies.
John Hill, an assistant director of FEO, said in an
interview that gasoline stations probably would get about
15 to 20 percent less gasoline than the public would use if
there were no shortage.
Essential services which purchase gasoline in bulk were
assigned all the fuel they need. Other commercial bulk
buyers such as taxi fleets will receive as much as they did in
1972.
The regulation itself, however, described this
second-priority category as "all other business ventures"
and spokesmen for the FEO at first told newsmen, in
answer to questions, that gasoline stations were in that
category.
But Hill later said they were not in either the first or
second priority categories, but right where they were in the
regulations as originally proposed last Dec. 12-last in line,
to receive whatever is left after the priority users are served.

Candidate Reply Right Considered
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed yesterday
to consider whether states may force newspapers to print
editorial replies from political candidates.
The justices will hear arguments late; this term on the
constitutionality of Florida's right-to-reply law, which
grants candidates access to newspapers that "assail" the
candidate's record or character.
The Florida Supreme Court upheld the law, finding that
it enhanced freedom of speech in pursuit of free and fair
elections. The Miami Herald appealed the decision, and
several major news and civil liberties organizations called
the ruling a major and unprecedented violation of the First
Amendment.
Simon, Nader Oil Testimonies Clash
WASHINGTON — Federal Energy Director William E.
Simon told Congress yesterday the nation is threatened
with "dangerously low levels" of petroleum products, but
consumer advocate Ralph Nader said the world is

"drowning in oil."
Their sharply conflicting views were presented in
testimony before a House-Senate economic subcommittee
looking into the accuracy of government energy statistics.
"While many doubt the accuracy of the data being
provided by industry," said Simon, "there is no doubt in
my mind that we do indeed have a serious shortage.
"As of Dec. 29, the American Petroleum Institute
reported we have only slightly over 30 days' supply of the
major petroleum products. The shortage caused by a full
effective embargo will quickly reduce these to dangerously
low levels unless we act quickly to reduce demand and
equitably allocate the available supplies," he said.
Nader described America's energy problem as "unarmed
robbery by oil companies in collusion with government
support." Denying an energy shortage exists, he said,
everything that has happened in the name of the energy
crisis has been to the advantage of the major petroleum
companies.
"The world is literally drowning in oil," Nader said.
"Any government agency can create a shortage simply by
announcing it."
Energy Office Issues New Rules
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office (FEO)
issued regulations last night that in effect will force owners
of oil-heated residences to lower their thermostats six
degrees and leave gasoline stations last in line for available
supplies.
John Hill, an assistant director of FEO, said in an
interview that gasoline stations probably would get about
15 to 20 percent less gasoline than the public would use if
there were no shortage.
Essential services which purchase gasoline in bulk were
assigned all the fuel they need. Other commercial bulk
buyers such as taxi fleets will receive as much as they did in
1972.
The regulation itself, however, described this
second-priority category as "all other business ventures"
and spokesmen for the FEO at first told newsmen, in
answer to questions, that gasoline stations were in that
category.
But Hill later said they were not in either the first or
second priority categories, but right where they were in the
regulations as originally proposed last Dec. 12-last in line,
to receive whatever is left after the priority users are served.

Egypt Counters Kissinger's Plan
ASWAN, Egypt — Egypt rejected parts of Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger's troop pullback plan for the Suez
front yesterday and gave him counterproposals an Egyptian
spokesman called "the first step toward peace."
Kissinger said, "The gap has been substantially
narrowed."
Kissinger's comment was made in a statement read by
U.S. Ambassador Hermann Eilts, as the secretary of state
flew to Jerusalem for another session with Israeli officials.
Eilts said Kissinger, who met with Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat for Vh hours last night, was expected back in
Aswan within the next couple of days in hopes that the
"gap will be narrowed further."
In Jerusalem, the Israelis announced that today's
meeting of the Arab and Israeli military delegations, which
have been negotiating troop pullbacks in Geneva, was
canceled at the request of the Egyptians.

"As of Dec. 29, the American Petroleum Institute
reported we have only slightly over 30 days' supply of the
major petroleum products. The shortage caused by a full
effective embargo will quickly reduce these to dangerously
low levels unless we act quickly to reduce demand and
equitably allocate the available supplies," he said.
Nader described America's energy problem as "unarmed
robbery by oil companies in collusion with government
support." Denying an energy shortage exists, he said,
everything that has happened in the name of the energy
crisis has been to the advantage of the major petroleum
companies.
"The world is literally drowning in oil," Nader said.
"Any government agency can create a shortage simply by
announcing it."
Energy Office Issues New Rules
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office (FEO)
issued regulations last night that in effect will force owners
of oil-heated residences to lower their thermostats six
degrees and leave gasoline stations last in line for available
supplies.
John Hill, an assistant director of FEO, said in an
interview that gasoline stations probably would get about
15 to 20 percent less gasoline than the public would use if
there were no shortage.
Essential services which purchase gasoline in bulk were
assigned all the fuel they need. Other commercial bulk
buyers such as taxi fleets will receive as much as they did in
1972.
The regulation itself, however, described this
second-priority category as "all other business ventures"
and spokesmen for the FEO at first told newsmen, in
answer to questions, that gasoline stations were in that
category.
But Hill later said they were not in either the first or
second priority categories, but right where they were in the
regulations as originally proposed last Dec. 12-last in line,
to receive whatever is left after the priority users are served.
