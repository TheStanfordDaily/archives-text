# Judiciary Panel Advises Disbarment For Agnew
## 
### 
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) â€” A panel
of Maryland judges said yesterday that
former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
is unfit to practice law and should be
disbarred because of deceitful and
dishonest conduct.
In a recommendation to the
Maryland Court of Appeals, the special
three-judge panel said Agnew "has
admitted his guilt to a crime involving
moral turpitude."
The recommendation resulted from
disciplinary proceedings brought by
the Maryland Bar Association after
Agnew resigned the vice presidency
and pleaded no contest Oct. 10 to a
federal income tax evasion charge.
The judges emphasized that their
recommendation was based solely on
Agnew's no contest plea to the charge
that he listed his taxable income for
1967 as $26,099 instead of $55,599
and that he paid taxes of $6,416
instead of the $19,967 which he owed.
Allegations Disregarded
They said they gave no
consideration to allegations made in
court by federal prosecutors that
Agnew had accepted kickbacks from
contractors doing business with
Maryland while he was governor.
Agnew's lawyers had argued that
the tax plea alone was not enough to
justify disbarment and that other
charges could not be considered.
There was no comment from
Agnew on the panel's decision. "Mr.
Agnew will not be making a statement

at this particular time," said Ann
Breen, a receptionist in his Washington
office.
In their decision the judges said,
"His conduct, characterized as it must
be as deceitful and dishonest, strikes at
the heart of the basic object of the
legal profession.
"We see no extenuating
circumstances allowing a lesser
sanction," they said in calling for
disbarment rather than the suspension
Agnew had sought.
"In our opinion, the proper
administration of justice, the proper
respect of the court for itself and a
proper regard for the integrity of the
legal profession compel us to conclude
that the respondent is unfit to
continue as a member of the bar of
this state," the report said.
Appellate Possibilities
The final decision on whether to
suspend, disbar or reprimand the
former Maryland governor will be
made by the Court of Appeals,
Maryland's highest court.
That court has sustained lower
court judges in a majority of
disbarment cases, but occasionally has
assessed stiffer or lesser penalties.
Agnew has 30 days in which to
challenge the recommendation and ask
for a hearing before the Court of
Appeals. A court spokesman said a
hearing could be scheduled by late
February or early March.

Agnew appealed to the special
panel, Judges Ridgely P. Melvin,
Shirley B. Jones and William H.
McCullough, at a Dec. 18 hearing not
to deprive him of his ability to make a
living.
He said that rather than disbarment
he should be suspended for a suitable
period, saying such action would be "a
reasonable protection for the courts
and the bar."
Agnew told the panel he had great
love and respect for the legal
profession and the practice of law.
"Should I be permitted to resume
my practice, I would conduct myself
in a way that would not bring discredit
to the bar, the legal profession or the
courts," he said.
