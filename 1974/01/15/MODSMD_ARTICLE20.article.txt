# 'Quad' Sales End—Outlook Good
## 
### 
Sales of the Quad officially end
today, with staffers of the yearbook
confident the organization will wind
up in the black by selling 1300 books.
Alan Bush, the Quad's editor, noted
that the annual's initial costs were
donated, thus making the book
solvent.
"This year we had $6000 donated
to us to start up the book —
'pre-publication' costs. Any profit we
get this year will go into next year's
book," Bush stated.
Kevin McDermott, Quad business
manager, estimated that 1300 of the
$10 books will be sold by today,
leaving the 1975 Quad with an extra
$2000 working capital.
"We expect a profit of at least
$2000 or more," McDermott stated.
He noted, however, that the profit
does not include this year's $6000 in
donations which will be used as
"pre-publication money" for next
year's production, he said.
"Basically, the money is in the
bank to assure creditors we can pay,
just like any other company. It's more
or less a security," McDermott said.
Most of the funds eventually go to
photographic equipment and supplies,
and sales promotion.
Bush added that this year's
336-page yearbook will feature a
nostalgia section, recapping the years

during which the Quad did not
publish.
He added that the Quad still seeks
ideas for candid shots suggested by
groups on campus.
"We're still asking for any inputs
from groups for events that they're

holding that are worth remembering.
We are also asking photographers to
help us or to donate pictures they have
taken," Bush said.
The Quad has scheduled senior
picture retakes tomorrow through
Friday from 1 to 5 p.m. in the lobby
of the Old Union.
