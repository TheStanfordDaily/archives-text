Stanford police were unable to
locate the source of the blast
heard on campus at 12:15 a.m.
yesterday. According to Chief
Marvin Herrington, the
department received several calls
from different areas on campus
regarding the explosion.
Herrington theorized that a large
firecracker or sonic boom might
have caused the loud noise.
Neither the Menlo Park nor Palo
Alto police departments had any
information on the explosion.
