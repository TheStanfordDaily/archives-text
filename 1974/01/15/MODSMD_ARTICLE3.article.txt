# Nuclear Power Lauded As Energy Source

### GEORGE TIBBITS 
Nuclear power, despite the
unsolved environmental problems it
creates, is an energy option this
society can't afford to ignore,
according to Milton Levenson, director
of the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), of Palo Alto.
Levenson, a specialist in reactor
safety measures, spoke yesterday
afternoon in Skilling Auditorium at
the first session of the winter program
seminar on energy, sponsored by
Stanford Institute for Energy Studies
and the EPRI.
Levenson said that nuclear power is

"cheaper than oil or coal." Reactors
"have higher reliability and lower costs
than plants of comparable size using
other fuels.
'Cleanest Fuel'
"In steady-state normal operation,"
he added, "nuclear power is also the
cleanest fuel environmentally." He
granted that disposal of excess heat
and radioactive wastes are serious
questions, but he suggested that they
are preferable to putting tons of
sulfur, mercury and ash in the air from
burning coal and other fuels.
"Everyone ought to accept the fact
that we know of no way to generate

electricity without insulting the
environment," Levenson said. "If you
want energy, somebody is going to
have to insult the environment in your
behalf."
Levenson pointed out that these
were judgmental questions that society
must answer, and that his role with the
EPRI was only to provide technical
information to utilities and the public
so they might make better decisions.
Breeder Reactors
Water-cooled reactors, by far the
most common in use today, can
provide an adequate but not unlimited
source of power for the immediate
future, Levenson said. But he believes
that dwindling resources of high grade
uranium ore will eventually make
breeder reactors essential.
Liquid metal fast breeder reactors
utilize large amounts of plutonium —
roughly a ton — in a high temperature
reactor that produces both energy and
a greater amount of plutonium than it
consumes, thus "breeding" fuel.
Such reactors have come under
attack lately from economists and
various environmental groups such as
Friends of the Earth. Breeders, they
maintain, are expensive to build and
operate, are hard to control, offer
increased danger of catastrophic
accidents, and present difficult
radioactive waste disposal problems.
Reactor Parks
Levenson said he thinks breeder
reactors can operate safely if they are
built in special "reactor parks" where
all plutonium is kept isolated within
the complex.
He added that breeder reactors are
essential to take care of power
demands until fusion reactors become
operational, probably not until the
next century.
Although he admitted that
scientists were "not always clear as to

what is a promise and what is a
problem" in every aspect of nuclear
power, Levenson was critical of those
who use statistically remote
possibilities of accidents as arguments
against reactors.
"There was talk that nuclear power
would provide power so cheap that we
wouldn't need meters, and others said
nuclear power was so deadly we would
wipe out society," he said. "These are
extremes, and the answer lies
between."
