# Loan To South Africa Questioned
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
In response to Wells Fargo's recent
$2 million loan to the South African
government, a committee of students,
faculty and staff will inquire into the
University's criteria for granting the
contract to the campus bank, ASSU
vice-president Charles Ogletree said at
the Senate meeting last night.
Ogletree said he wants the group to
inquire why Wells Fargo made the loan
and request that it make no further
loans to the South African

government. If the bank does not
show social responsibility toward the
Stanford community then the
University should look into alternative
banking services, Ogletree said. He
explained that the group, which meets
for the first time this Friday, will
consult with Wells Fargo officials
before making recommendations.
In response to a letter from
Ogletree, President of Wells Fargo
Robert Arbuckle said social
responsibility was a valid issue, but

defended the bank's loan.
Arbuckle said he thought
investment in the South African
economy "will upgrade jobs for blacks
now employed, create new jobs for the
unemployed, and contribute to the
gradual breakdown of the apartheid,
which we both reject."
In other business, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons announced he
will appoint an Assistant to the Dean
of Student Affairs for Women
The new position results from a
report by the Committee on
Education and Employment of
Women stating "the process of change
[in the university] needs some help in
recognizing where the problems are in
regard to women students," Lyons
said.
He explained the responsibility of
the assistant will be "to identify and
organize a network of people at
Stanford who have a special awareness
of and sensitivity to the needs and
problems of women scudents at
Stanford."
Lyons will appoint someone
already employed by the University to
devote half her time to the new
position.
