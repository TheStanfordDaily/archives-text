# Tresidder Store Offers Discounts
## 
### MARY PICKETT 
The newly-remodeled Tresidder
Store, in the past a losing operation,
now offers discount prices to attract
more customers, said Gary Ding, store
manager.
"The store was renovated during
the Christmas vacation to add more
room and reorganize the merchandise
so we can give better service," said
Ding.
He said the magazines and cold
boxes for refrigerated food were
moved into the space where the old
office used to be.
"The aisles are now larger and it's
not as congested as it was before. It's
easier to find the particular item the
customer wants," Ding added.
"The biggest complaint about the
store in the past has been the high
prices, so we are going discount to
increase our volume," he said.
"This is a trial period for the
discount program — if the volume
doesn't increase, we'll discontinue the
reduced prices."
Ranging from 10 to 30 percent off,
the discount will only effect health
and beauty items and notions, said
Ding. "Our prices on these products
now compare with those at other
discount houses like K-Mart," he
contended.
Commenting on the drugstore's
deficit, Ding said, "Part of the
problem is the rip-off situation. It's as
bad here as it is in the worse places in
San Francisco."
Attributing shoplifting to the
attitude of many students "who think
we're an easy touch," Ding said
students think the drugstore is
privately owned and run on a
commission basis.
However, hepointed out,the store is
actually owned by Stanford and
staffed by students. "When students
rip-off the store, they're ripping-off
themselves.
"The store isn't trying to make a
profit, but just trying to break even,"
he said.
To discourage shoplifting, Ding
said, the fastest moving products that
are easy to slip into pockets are now
separated and out where the cashier
can see them.
