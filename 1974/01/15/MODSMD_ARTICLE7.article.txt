# City Council Action On College Terrace
## Traffic Problem Goes To Committees 
### BILL ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council last night voted to refer the
problem of College Terrace traffic to its Policy and
Procedures Committee and to the Stanford/Palo Alto
liaison committee for further study.
The Policy and Procedures Committee had
recommended to the Council that city staff members be
directed to implement the plan submitted by the College
Terrace Residents Association for three months and then
report the results to the committee, but the council decided
that further study of the issue was needed.
In the proposal, Plan A, submitted to the city of Palo
Alto, members of the College Terrace Residents Association
had recommended that accesses to Stanford Avenue be
closed at the corners of Escondido, Bowdoin, Amherst and
Hanover. They claimed that the large volume of traffic
which employs Stanford Avenue as a substitute for Page
Mill Road is an inconvenience to residents of the
neighborhood.
A number of Pine Hill residents have argued that closing
Stanford Avenue would make it more difficult to reach
Palo Alto.
Vice Mayor Enid Pearson, in introducing the motion to
delay a decision on thy matter, noted that the issue should
be ready for consideration by the Council within a month.
The Stanford/Palo Alto liaison committee will meet on
Friday and the city's Policy and Procedure Committee will
meet again next month.

Mayor Kirke Comstock emphasized that the liaison
committee can act only in an advisory capacity and that the
final decisions in the matter must rest with the Palo Alto
City Council.
Pearson urged that the liaison committee's meetings,
normally held privately, be opened to the public on Friday.
"I think College Terrace people should be allowed to
hear what Stanford has to say," she remarked. "I urge you
to go there and speak to your representatives," Pearson told
the audience. A large number of people had attended the
meeting, hoping to discuss the issue.
The Council voted 7-1 to pass Pearson's motion, with
Councilman Roy Clay dissenting. Clay contended the
Council had all the information it needed to form a
decision.
The Council also decided not to pass a recommendation
of the Planning and Advisory Committee that Stanford be
requested to accelerate its schedule for the completion of
Campus Drive.
"I have met with Stanford officials and I am convinced
that the University is accelerating the completion of
Campus Drive to the best of its ability," Council John
Berwald said.
A motion to refer the matter to the Stanford/Palo Alto
liaison committee and the Planning and Policy Committee
for further consideration passed 6-2, with Pearson and Alan
Henderson opposing the measure.

meeting, hoping to discuss the issue.
The Council voted 7-1 to pass Pearson's motion, with
Councilman Roy Clay dissenting. Clay contended the
Council had all the information it needed to form a
decision.
The Council also decided not to pass a recommendation
of the Planning and Advisory Committee that Stanford be
requested to accelerate its schedule for the completion of
Campus Drive.
"I have met with Stanford officials and I am convinced
that the University is accelerating the completion of
Campus Drive to the best of its ability," Council John
Berwald said.
A motion to refer the matter to the Stanford/Palo Alto
liaison committee and the Planning and Policy Committee
for further consideration passed 6-2, with Pearson and Alan
Henderson opposing the measure.
The Palo Alto City Council last night voted to refer the
problem of College Terrace traffic to its Policy and
Procedures Committee and to the Stanford/Palo Alto
liaison committee for further study.
The Policy and Procedures Committee had
recommended to the Council that city staff members be
directed to implement the plan submitted by the College
Terrace Residents Association for three months and then
report the results to the committee, but the council decided
that further study of the issue was needed.
In the proposal, Plan A, submitted to the city of Palo
Alto, members of the College Terrace Residents Association
had recommended that accesses to Stanford Avenue be
closed at the corners of Escondido, Bowdoin, Amherst and
Hanover. They claimed that the large volume of traffic
which employs Stanford Avenue as a substitute for Page
Mill Road is an inconvenience to residents of the
neighborhood.
A number of Pine Hill residents have argued that closing
Stanford Avenue would make it more difficult to reach
Palo Alto.
Vice Mayor Enid Pearson, in introducing the motion to
delay a decision on thy matter, noted that the issue should
be ready for consideration by the Council within a month.
The Stanford/Palo Alto liaison committee will meet on
Friday and the city's Policy and Procedure Committee will
meet again next month.

Mayor Kirke Comstock emphasized that the liaison
committee can act only in an advisory capacity and that the
final decisions in the matter must rest with the Palo Alto
City Council.
Pearson urged that the liaison committee's meetings,
normally held privately, be opened to the public on Friday.
"I think College Terrace people should be allowed to
hear what Stanford has to say," she remarked. "I urge you
to go there and speak to your representatives," Pearson told
the audience. A large number of people had attended the
meeting, hoping to discuss the issue.
