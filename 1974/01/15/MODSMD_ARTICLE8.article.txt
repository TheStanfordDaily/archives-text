# The 						Other Stanford
## Editors Rebut Review

Appel, Peterson, Schoenau

(This is the conclusion of a
two-part response to Prof. Brody's
critique of the publication, The Other
Stanford, which appeared on this page
at the end of fall quarter.)
Prof. Brody states that the report
and its recommendations are without
focus in that they urge doing
"everything to reform the system." He
implies that the recommendations are
solely (and inappropriately) directed
towards University-wide legislation. He
is mistaken in these criticisms.
First, the data and the
recommendations do not urge faculty
to interact with students in every
possible way. Rather, the data
demonstrate that of three types of
interaction, only two are effective in
increasing the occurence of four
outcomes of the educational process,
while one, social, is not. This is a
significant finding for it suggests that
the University may be misdirecting its
energies by overly encouraging social
interaction between faculty and
freshman.
Second, we have organized the
recommendations around four general
objectives so that if readers disagree
with specific mechanisms they at least
will understand the goals toward
which they are directed. If, as
Professor Brody wishes, we were to
organize them around the University's
organizational structure, eight of them
would call for university-wide
legislation, eight would be directed to
particular administrative entities, five
would be recommended to
departments and seven would be
directed toward individual students
and faculty.
Professor Brody asserts that the
data in the report do not support its
claim that "the present level and
quality of interaction between faculty
and students is inadequate. . One
might argue, as he does, that the fact
that 76 percent of all undergraduates
have never engaged in independent
study and 61 percent have never felt
personally close to a faculty member,
does not constitute proof that
interaction is insufficient.
If, however, one believes that the
outcome of having work extensively
critiqued by a faculty member is
important, and is confronted by the
report's findings that 59 percent of all
undergraduates (and 48 percent of all
seniors) have never experienced this,
and further, is presented with the fact
that students who did report having
experienced the outcome were about
80 percent more likely also to have
been those who had engaged in
independent study or reported feeling
close to a faculty member, then the
conclusion that the data are

inadequate hardly seems justified.
It is unclear what Professor Brody
means when he comments that the
material in Chapters II and 111 "is not
adequate for the task of reasoned
commentary." If his concern is one of
the data upon which we made the
judgment that four factors in the
Stanford environment must be altered
in order to increase student-faculty
interaction, then the sources are noted
in footnotes throughout Chapter 11.
Quickly summarized, the data came
from three empirical studies of
Stanford and its faculty, twenty-five
interviews with faculty from four
departments, and discussions with over
a score of administrators and Advisory
Board members.
If, however, his statement reflects a
disagreement with the conclusions we
drew from these data then we can only
state that this is an area where
reasonable men may disagree and we
invite him to disprove our judgments.
We must note, nevertheless, that when,
for instance, it is the shared perception
of most faculty members in three
empirical studies and twenty-five
interviews that the faculty reward
structure does not encourage and
sometimes mitigates against their
making commitments to
undergraduate teaching, it seems
reasonable to us to conclude that this
reward system needs to be modified if
more interaction is to occur.
These observations aside, Prof.
Brody has raised some valuable
criticisms. Some of the
recommendations were not based on
the data presented in Chapter I;
instead, they arose out of the analysis
found in Chapter II and logical
extensions of the data from the
student survey (the TA
recommendation, for instance). It
would have been helpful to ask
questions about "one-to-few" and
"one-to-many" in regard to the basis
of critical thinking. In addition, more
work could be done with the causes of
student satisfaction. Lastly,
exploration into what exactly
constitutes critical thinking, an
analysis the report did not attempt,
seems a fruitful direction for further
research.
In closing, we would like to urge all
members of the Stanford community
to give The Other Stanford similar
searching, direct criticism. Intensive
criticism such as Prof. Brody's can
only heighten our understanding of
the issues. Such awareness makes
changing the "other Stanford" more
likely.
