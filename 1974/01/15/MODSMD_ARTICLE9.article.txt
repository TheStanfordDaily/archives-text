# Times Have Changed
## 'Off ROTC' No Longer Applies 
### 
Larry Diamond

For anyone who lived through the political convulsions
on this campus four years ago in which the issue of ROTC
was so prominent, the present discussion regarding its
possible reinstatement may evoke some rather bitter and
unpleasant memories.
There was a lot of venom and violence in the political
atmosphere back then, and the ultimate decision to sever
the University's ties to ROTC came at least as much
because of the immense amount of pure community power
that was applied (petitions, sit-ins, demonstrations of all
kinds) as because of the logic of the arguments marshalled
on behalf of ROTC's dismissal.
It was not a proud moment in the history of a
University, but still it was a crucially important and
appropriate decision that was made. It was one of the few
clear ways then that a major university could disassociate
itself even in part from involvement in and endorsement of
a cruel and immoral war.
Though its impact was more symbolic than real,
Stanford's decision to terminate ROTC, coming as it did in
the midst of similar decisions by other major universities,
helped to encourage and expand the popular movement
against the Vietnam War.
It was more than simply ending a program that
compromised the University's autonomy and academic
integrity; it was also an institutional stand against mass
murder; less of a stand than the University could have, or
perhaps should have taken, but more than it would
otherwise have done had it not been for the collective
efforts of hundreds of people in this community.
Times Have Changed
It was an important victory for the anti-war movement
here, but that was three and a half years ago. Times have
changed, issues have changed. America has changed. But the
chant of the dedicated remnants of the anti-war movement
remains the same: "Off ROTC."
One must admire the continuing commitment of those
who are again now raising their voices in protest against
ROTC, but their arguments are no longer convincing. Like
so much of the American left (and right) they maintain the
same knee-jerk reaction to an issue long after it has changed
in fundamental respects.
Anyone today concerned about the rise of militarism in
America, about the dangers of a military divorced from
humanitarian influences and civilian control, ought to favor
there instatement of ROTC to Stanford and other major
universities, unless they believe that this country should
unilaterally disarm.
A Necessary Evil
If one accepts that we must maintain some kind of
military strength in the near future — not as top-heavy with
officers and laden with nuclear gadgetry as at present, but a
military at an adequate level of strength and readiness—then
one must accept that we will need military officers trained
somewhere.
I would much prefer to see as high a proportion of our
military officers as possible trained at universities like
Stanford, compared with the much more rigid, uniform,
and narrow environments of the military academies.
Let us educate them in schools where they might take a
course in Ethics from Robert McAfee Brown, or a course in

Problems of Good and Evil from a man like Phillip
Rhinelander, or learn about the realities of American
involvement in Southeast Asia from an authority like John
Lewis, or study our political process under someone like
Hubert Marshall.
True, not all officers trained at major universities will
take courses that challenge them to grapple with weighty
ethical, political and social questions. True, a lot of
Stanford graduates wound up designing and dropping the
bombs that so cruelly burned the flesh of so many
Vietnamese children.
Questioning Immorality
But there were also college graduates who, as officers,
questioned what was going on and refused to take part.
And an officer from Stanford would seem more likely to
question immoral practices in the future than one from
West Point.
Only a fool would argue that a more complete
integration of potential officers into quality civilian colleges
would have prevented the atrocities of Vietnam. But had
more officers come from universities like Stanford, and
perhaps, had they come from ROTC programs that were
structured to give the universities control over the
programs, the atrocities might have been fewer, the
questioning from within the military might have been more
widespread and emphatic.
At a time when any non-violent way of striking out
against the war and the military machine seemed morally
necessary, and when the removal of ROTC was one of the
few immediate and effective tactical steps available to the
university community, the campaign against ROTC was
critically important to the campaign agasinst the Vietnam
War.
But now our active military involvement in Vietnam is
done with. While we still supply Thieu with the means to
repress and wage war against his own people, and while this
must be actively opposed, opposition to ROTC no longer
makes sense as a tactical step for fighting against a bad
Vietnam policy.
The issue has changed. There is no longer the moral
necessity or the logical justification for trying to bring the
whole military machine to a screeching halt.
As far as the structure of ROTC, Stanford may well be
able to demand what it wants from the Pentagon, if indeed
Lenny Siegel is correct in emphasizing how high Stanford is
on the Pentagon's list of priorities for re-instatement. The
conditions recently outlined by President Lyman — where
ROTC courses are planned and taught and accredited by
University professors rather than military officers, and the
only penalty for dropping out of ROTC is repayment of the
scholarship — are the minimum that the University should
accept.
Should the University be able to obtain such conditions
in a newly structured ROTC program which emphasizes
university autonomy and control, ROTC ought to be
re-instated by the Faculty Senate. As one student who
beseechc d that body to remove the program four years ago,
I would urge them to restore it now.
