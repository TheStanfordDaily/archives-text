# Media Critic Cites Duties Of Press
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
"The rights of the press are blurred
by the courtroom, the newsroom and
the Oval Room," and the public must
wonder "whose First Amendment it
is," well known media critic and
former CBS News President Fred
Friendly told an audience of about
300 at Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
Friendly, currently professor of
journalism at Columbia, attacked both
the Nixon Administration and the
contemporary media for their
attitudes toward freedom of the press.
He singled out those "falsely crying
'First Amendment' in a crowded
courtroom," saying they "distort its
[the Amendment's] past" and "cloud
its future."
He also criticized the
Administration's policies toward the
news media, pointing out "nobody is
laughing now" at the idea of a
governmental "conspiracy" or "grand
design" to restrict an open society.
He cited documentation provided
by the Senate Watergate Committee
showing a great concern on the
President's part over content of news
commentaries. "The record documents
the Administration's determination to
'get' the institution of journalism," he
contended.
Journalists take advantage of press
privileges under the umbrella of the
first amendment, further shrinking its
protection for those who need it most,
Friendly also argued. The First
Amendment, he said, protects the
rights of people, not monopolistic
chains of newspapers.
Friendly also pointed out a
relationship between irresponsible
journalism and court decisions that
tend to place restrictions on press
freedom. To illustrate his point, he
cited the Miami Herald case that
reached the Supreme Court Monday.
In the Herald case, a newspaper
refused to print a letter from a state
