# Media Critic Cites Duties Of Press
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
"The rights of the press are blurred
by the courtroom, the newsroom and
the Oval Room," and the public must
wonder "whose First Amendment it
is," well known media critic and
former CBS News President Fred
Friendly told an audience of about
300 at Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
Friendly, currently professor of
journalism at Columbia, attacked both
the Nixon Administration and the
contemporary media for their
attitudes toward freedom of the press.
He singled out those "falsely crying
'First Amendment' in a crowded
courtroom," saying they "distort its
[the Amendment's] past" and "cloud
its future."
He also criticized the
Administration's policies toward the
news media, pointing out "nobody is
laughing now" at the idea of a
governmental "conspiracy" or "grand
design" to restrict an open society.
He cited documentation provided
by the Senate Watergate Committee
showing a great concern on the
President's part over content of news
commentaries. "The record documents
the Administration's determination to
'get' the institution of journalism," he
contended.
Journalists take advantage of press
privileges under the umbrella of the
first amendment, further shrinking its
protection for those who need it most,
Friendly also argued. The First
Amendment, he said, protects the
rights of people, not monopolistic
chains of newspapers.
Friendly also pointed out a
relationship between irresponsible
journalism and court decisions that
tend to place restrictions on press
freedom. To illustrate his point, he
cited the Miami Herald case that
reached the Supreme Court Monday.

assembly candidate who wished to
rebut inferences made in a news article
that he was unfit to be a lawmaker
because he had led a teacher's strike a
few years previously.
A Florida appeals court reversed a
lower court's decision that found the
rarely applied "right of reply" law
unconstitutional.
"Five men on the Supreme Court
might decide that it's legal," Friendly
said. "But the Herald didn't break the
law, they just acted irresponsibly. And
by their act they risk government
regulation for all news media."
He also cited a recent charge by the
Action In Media (AIM) organization
that an NBC news documentary on
pension plans violated the fairness
doctrine. Such attacks could cause
broadcasters to shy away from
presenting controversial issues to the
public, Friendly predicted.
On a related matter, Friendly
explained the Administration's

"contagion" has spread even to the
courts, the traditional guardian of
First Amendment rights.
In support of this, he cited the
numerous subpoenas issued to
newsmen in the wake of the Supreme
Court's decision in the Caldwell case,
which concerned a grand jury
subpoena of a newsman's notes. He
criticized "lazy prosecutors and
judges," who, he said, fail in the
majority of cases to prove the
reporter's information either is
essential to solving the case or cannot
be obtained from other sources.
He further criticized judges' orders
that prohibit coverage of current trials,
attacking especially the current
requirement that reporters obey such
orders while appealing them. He listed
numerous contempt citations issued
reporters, newspapers, and broadcast
stations, either for violation of such
rules or for refusing to divulge sources.
Friendly emphasized not only shall
Congress make "no law" regarding

freedom of the press, but "we cannot
give that power to anyone else,
either." He told his audience they, as
consumers, must be "as discriminating
in news judgement" as in selecting
"other commodities."
"You are robbed of your birthright
when cheated on news output,"
Friendly concluded.

assembly candidate who wished to
rebut inferences made in a news article
that he was unfit to be a lawmaker
because he had led a teacher's strike a
few years previously.
A Florida appeals court reversed a
lower court's decision that found the
rarely applied "right of reply" law
unconstitutional.
"Five men on the Supreme Court
might decide that it's legal," Friendly
said. "But the Herald didn't break the
law, they just acted irresponsibly. And
by their act they risk government
regulation for all news media."
He also cited a recent charge by the
Action In Media (AIM) organization
that an NBC news documentary on
pension plans violated the fairness
doctrine. Such attacks could cause
broadcasters to shy away from
presenting controversial issues to the
public, Friendly predicted.
On a related matter, Friendly
explained the Administration's

"contagion" has spread even to the
courts, the traditional guardian of
First Amendment rights.
In support of this, he cited the
numerous subpoenas issued to
newsmen in the wake of the Supreme
Court's decision in the Caldwell case,
which concerned a grand jury
subpoena of a newsman's notes. He
criticized "lazy prosecutors and
judges," who, he said, fail in the
majority of cases to prove the
reporter's information either is
essential to solving the case or cannot
be obtained from other sources.
He further criticized judges' orders
that prohibit coverage of current trials,
attacking especially the current
requirement that reporters obey such
orders while appealing them. He listed
numerous contempt citations issued
reporters, newspapers, and broadcast
stations, either for violation of such
rules or for refusing to divulge sources.
Friendly emphasized not only shall
Congress make "no law" regarding

freedom of the press, but "we cannot
give that power to anyone else,
either." He told his audience they, as
consumers, must be "as discriminating
in news judgement" as in selecting
"other commodities."
"You are robbed of your birthright
when cheated on news output,"
Friendly concluded.
"The rights of the press are blurred
by the courtroom, the newsroom and
the Oval Room," and the public must
wonder "whose First Amendment it
is," well known media critic and
former CBS News President Fred
Friendly told an audience of about
300 at Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
Friendly, currently professor of
journalism at Columbia, attacked both
the Nixon Administration and the
contemporary media for their
attitudes toward freedom of the press.
He singled out those "falsely crying
'First Amendment' in a crowded
courtroom," saying they "distort its
[the Amendment's] past" and "cloud
its future."
He also criticized the
Administration's policies toward the
news media, pointing out "nobody is
laughing now" at the idea of a
governmental "conspiracy" or "grand
design" to restrict an open society.
He cited documentation provided
by the Senate Watergate Committee
showing a great concern on the
President's part over content of news
commentaries. "The record documents
the Administration's determination to
'get' the institution of journalism," he
contended.
Journalists take advantage of press
privileges under the umbrella of the
first amendment, further shrinking its
protection for those who need it most,
Friendly also argued. The First
Amendment, he said, protects the
rights of people, not monopolistic
chains of newspapers.
Friendly also pointed out a
relationship between irresponsible
journalism and court decisions that
tend to place restrictions on press
freedom. To illustrate his point, he
cited the Miami Herald case that
reached the Supreme Court Monday.
