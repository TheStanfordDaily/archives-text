# 'The Advent Of Yesterday'
## Take The Present A Little More Seriously 
### 
Stan Baker

The ways we look, act, dress and feel out ourselves here in the beginning of
1974 lead one to suspect that somewhere back in the late 60s Father Time must
have wound the clock backwards. Because the differenter we get the samer we
are, and the more seriously we chase after y&terday's shadows the funnier the
whole scene becomes.
Today's tastes in fashion, music, entertainment, and living styles seem to
carry one message: the advent of yesterday. Baggy pants, with cuffs, no less,
wide lapels, oxfords, argyles, plaids, and wool, for God's sake, adorn the best
dressed men. High heeled pumps, ankle length dresses, floppy hats and veils, and
countless other catastrophes frequent women's wardrobes. And you have to look
closely to see the differences.
Musically, we're not looking backwards as much as into a mirror, circus
variety, the kind that distorts images â€” for better or worse. Because in the mad
struggle for new directions, a few clever entertainers like Bette Midler,
Sha-Na-Na, Elton John, Tiny Tim, and others (dare I mention even those in the
same breath?) beat the struggle for creativity by re-creating what we never
understood in the first place, the past and ourselves especially. And it pays big
bucks because everyone wants a chance to change, or at least see a little
differently, the parts of ourselves which never can change.
The comic parody of it all is the payoff because the only thing we learn in
trying to be yesterday's people is that each time around there are new mistakes
to be made. What tasted bad with ketchup probably tastes worse with mustard.
So maybe we'll continue to fool ourselves by trying pickle-relish the next time
around. The harder we try the worse it gets, but as long as every attempt at
recreating the past turns out a little different we needn't fear the contradiction
of redundancy, and stand to gain at least a little by our new mistakes.
Living Styles
The more important and alarming aspects of our regressions into the past are
not in clothing or music or in the cars we drive or the schools we go to (or
choose not to go to), but in the styles of living, and thought, and socializing, and
politicizing which at first glance appear to accompany the new movement.
What to call the movement itself is even puzzling. "Nostalgia"? Certainly
"revolution" is inaccurate, perhaps if I may be permitted to recoin old terms
then "contra-revolution" or "involution" might be appropriate. In any case, the
remarkably sad societal stagnation and deterioration we are witnessing may or
may not be related to the hangups with our past, but it makes one wonder.
Tricky Dick has been around for abut 25 years now, and though he's been
saying and doing pretty much the same things for as long, we haven't got rid of
him yet and it's beginning to look like we never will.
The corruption in both public and private life, take as examples Watergate,
the oil companies, milk producers, etc., have been with us all the time but
perhaps now it is better documented by the media. Though one could hope that
such massive exposure would eradicate the problems, it appears unfortunately to
have multiplied the corruption by glamorizing those involved and instead, to
have merely heightened public cynicism.
Social Mechanisms Weaken
The increasing politization of what once were nonpolitical issues give
evidence to the failure of society's social mechanisms, take as examples the
Mideast oil crisis on an international scale (not to mention the Munich killings).

the massive strikes, governmental mismanagement, and labor-management
disputes on a national scale, the deterioration of our cities on a local level, and
on a personal level the "equal everything for everybody, now, with a little extra
for backpay" movements in their militancy and incontinent demands have
reversed in many ways the gains made in times when we weren't as uptight as we
were just plain mad.
Hope is in sight, or hindsight, if we choose to spend less time joking about the
past and taking the present a little more seriously. It takes strong individuals,
nations, and a world to do that, and the question which lies restlessly within us
all is "Do we have it in us?" Of course we'll never answer that completely
because today's answer is tomorrow's question. But, for now, I'm going to put
my thumb back in my mouth and go back to play with my hula hoop and
skateboard.
