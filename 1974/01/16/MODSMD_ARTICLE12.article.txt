# Haydn, Schumann, Hoist
## Ozawa's 'Intimate' Program 
### KENNETH DeLONG 
Works of an intimate nature
were the fare for the second series
of concerts of the new year given
by the San Francisco Symphony.
Conductor Seiji Ozawa lead the
orchestra in a program that
featured the Schuman Cello
Concerto with Ken Yasuda as
soloist, and concluded with a
sterling rendition of Gustav
Hoist's most popular work, The
Planets.
The concert opened with the
Notturno in C (No. 1) by Haydn,
continuing Ozawa's three-year
Haydn survey. H.C.
Robbins-Landon, the high priest
of Haydn scholarship, was quoted
in the program notes as placing
the work on the level of Haydn's
mature symphonies. This was
patently not the case. The work,
although pleasant, is definitely
lightweight, and was not enhanced
by the routine treatment it
received.
Although Ozawa drastically
reduced the size of the orcehstra
and valiantly attempted to
capture the grace and charm of
the style, the actual result was
mediocre. It was not so much that
the performance was particularly
inaccurate, it is just that so much
more was possible. Any modern
virtuoso orchestra like the San
Francisco Symphony can read a
Haydn notturno at sight and make
it sound passable. The San
Francisco Symphony on this
occasion did little more.
Schumann Cello Concerto
Ken Yasuda, the young
Japanese cellist, was the soloist in
a musically satisfying though
technically flawed performance of
the Schumann Cello Concerto.
The concerto is late Schumann,
filled with melodies that are at
once deeply expressive and
rhythmically indeterminate.
Yasuda's performance was
admirable in its undertanding of
the musical and poetical qualities
of the score. Unfortunately, there
were several passages where his
technique let him down, and the
occasional buzzing noises that
emerged from his cello grew more
numerous and more irritating.
Ozawa was again, as usual, the
perfect accompanist. The

orchestral tuttis were well played
and the ensemble was admirable
in a work difficult to keep
together. Ozawa's skill in this line
fully equals his considerable talent
as a solo conductor.
Brilliant 'Planets'
The second half of the concert
was devoted to Hoist's orchestral
suite The Planets. The score is
filled with brilliant orchestral
touches and is Hoist's most
"characteristic" composition. It
was certainly here that the
rehearsal time was spent, and it
payed off in an exceptionally fine
performance which brought the
audience to its feet. Particularly
outstanding both in musical
quality and in performance was
the popular "Jupiter" movement
with its wonderfully
good-humoured tunes which at
times rival those of Elgar.
(Incidentally, Canadian readers
will know this piece as the source
for the theme song of the CTV
national news.)
The final movement, entitled

"Neptune," brought the evening
to a quiet and peaceful close,
concluding the concert on the
same intimate note in which it
had begun.

I-CENTER ART SHOW—This ink painting of Mount Fuji in the snow is from the current exhibit at the
Bechtel International Center. The artist is Sohaku Nasu of Japan. The paintings in the exhibit are done in
a new, individual style developed by the artist using black, blue, and brown inks freely rather than the
traditional black alone. Nasu's paintings have been widely shown in Japan, but this is his first overseas
exhibit. The show continues at the International Center throughout the month of January.
