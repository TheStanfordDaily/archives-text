# 'Happy Talk' Invades TV News
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Am I the only person in the
Bay Area who winces every time
Channel 7 newsman Jerry Jensen
turns slightly in his chair and
begins, "Well, Van, a tragic story
coming out of the East Bay
tonight...."?
Jensen, along with anchorman
Van Amburg, sportscaster John
O'Reilly and weatherman Pete
Giddings, comprise the cast of
KGO's News Scene, "the Bay
Area's award-winning news team"
(it won an Emmy last year) and
the top-ranked TV news program
in the area.
Long-time local viewers recall
that KGO, which is owned and
operated by ABC, was less than
spectacularly successful with a
series of anihormen in the 19605,
including ftoger Grimsby, now
kingpin of*the New York City
ratings on W ABC-TV, and Peter
Jennings, now ABC News'
excellent Mideast correspondent.
Sugar-Coated News
News Scene began to click with
the institution of what has
popularly become known as
"happy-talk" news. Judging from
the results broadcast onto local
screens, "happy talk" simply
means sugar-coating the news,
making it palatable for the lowest
common denominator, with little
jokes, asides and chatty bridges
between items. How can viewers
avoid feeling that they are held in
contempt by the show's
producers, who appear to aim the

program at a 12-year-old
mentality?
If there were just one such
station in San Francisco, there
would be less reason to complain
— we could simply watch another
station. But in the breakneck rush
for ratings, it appears that all
three commercial stations in the
City have landed on the same
bandwagon.
The trend has been most
immediately apparent at
KRON-TV, owned by the

Entertainment

Chronicle Publishing Corp. Ever
sihce bland veteran newscaster Art
Brown was discharged last year,
there has been a rush of KRON
anchormen, with the Phil Wilsons
replacing the Dave Valentines
replacing the Kevin McCulloughs
at a maddening pace.
Two weeks ago, KRON
introduced a new face, Fred
LaCosse from KNTV in San Jose,
as anchorman, and replaced
weatherperson Terry Lowry with
something named Jack McKenna,
who succeeds in making KPIX
(Channel 5) Eyewitness News
weatherperson Bob Lobertini look
almost intelligent.
LaCosse is pleasant enough,

and looks as though he might even
be a good newsman given the
chance. But McKenna and
sportscaster Eddie Alexander
range from the incoherent to the
unintelligible — Alexander mostly
because he talks a mile a minute.
And of course, the obligatory
"Good job, Jack" 'sand "Thanks,
Eddie" 'sand other side
comments eat time and distract
viewers who tuned in to get the
news, not watch a sensitivity
session.

Gradual Shift At KPIX
The change at Westinghouse
Broadcasting's KPIX — the best
news operation in the area as
recently as last year — has been
more insidious only because the
personnel shift has not been quite
as sudden as at KRON.
First, weatherman Leon
Hunsaker departed, succeeded this
past summer by the
above-mentioned Lobertini, a
grinning gargoyle imported from
Nashville, Tenn. at $70,000 a
year. Then co-anchorman Joe
Glover left, along with several
lower-level figures, in a shakeup
initiated by new news
directorship.
Word recently came down that

excellent sportscaster Barry
Tompkins is being replaced by
Milt Kahn, a Los Angeles radio
figure. And anchorman Ron
Magers, far and away the best in
the area, is now also said to be
leaving at the end of the month.
The material he's had to do in the
last few months has been
embarrassing — and Magers looks
like he's been embarrassed to do
it.
Only Late-Evening Entrants
For all intents and purposes,
KGO, KRON and KPIX are the
only entrants in the late evening
news sweepstakes. Cox
Broadcasting's KTVU in Oakland,
the only other local commercial
VHP station, comes on at 10 p.m.
Happy-talk producers point to
the ratings their stations have
gathered — but of course, if happy
talk is all there is, that's what will
take the ratings. KPIX was not a
not-too-distant second to KGO
in the ratings when it was still a
journalistically-respectable
operation and not a sideshow. It's
hard to believe that an
allegedly-cosmopolitan area like
San Francisco won't support a
good news team.
The biggest nightmare, of
course, is that the happy-talk
trend might spread to the
networks. God help us if Howard
K. Smith ever turns slightly in his
chair and begins, "Well, Harry, a
tragic story coming out of
Washington tonight. . .

Bay Area who winces every time

Brown was discharged last year,
there has been a rush of KRON
anchormen, with the Phil Wilsons
replacing the Dave Valentines
replacing the Kevin McCulloughs
at a maddening pace.
Two weeks ago, KRON
introduced a new face, Fred
LaCosse from KNTV in San Jose,
as anchorman, and replaced
weatherperson Terry Lowry with
something named Jack McKenna,
who succeeds in making KPIX
(Channel 5) Eyewitness News
weatherperson Bob Lobertini look
almost intelligent.
LaCosse is pleasant enough,

and looks as though he might even
be a good newsman given the
chance. But McKenna and
sportscaster Eddie Alexander
range from the incoherent to the
unintelligible — Alexander mostly
because he talks a mile a minute.
And of course, the obligatory
"Good job, Jack" 'sand "Thanks,
Eddie" 'sand other side
comments eat time and distract
viewers who tuned in to get the
news, not watch a sensitivity
session.

Gradual Shift At KPIX
The change at Westinghouse
Broadcasting's KPIX — the best
news operation in the area as
recently as last year — has been
more insidious only because the
personnel shift has not been quite
as sudden as at KRON.
First, weatherman Leon
Hunsaker departed, succeeded this
past summer by the
above-mentioned Lobertini, a
grinning gargoyle imported from
Nashville, Tenn. at $70,000 a
year. Then co-anchorman Joe
Glover left, along with several
lower-level figures, in a shakeup
initiated by new news
directorship.
Word recently came down that

excellent sportscaster Barry
Tompkins is being replaced by
Milt Kahn, a Los Angeles radio
figure. And anchorman Ron
Magers, far and away the best in
the area, is now also said to be
leaving at the end of the month.
The material he's had to do in the
last few months has been
embarrassing — and Magers looks
like he's been embarrassed to do
it.
Only Late-Evening Entrants
For all intents and purposes,
KGO, KRON and KPIX are the
only entrants in the late evening
news sweepstakes. Cox
Broadcasting's KTVU in Oakland,
the only other local commercial
VHP station, comes on at 10 p.m.
Happy-talk producers point to
the ratings their stations have
gathered — but of course, if happy
talk is all there is, that's what will
take the ratings. KPIX was not a
not-too-distant second to KGO
in the ratings when it was still a
journalistically-respectable
operation and not a sideshow. It's
hard to believe that an
allegedly-cosmopolitan area like
San Francisco won't support a
good news team.
The biggest nightmare, of
course, is that the happy-talk
trend might spread to the
networks. God help us if Howard
K. Smith ever turns slightly in his
chair and begins, "Well, Harry, a
tragic story coming out of
Washington tonight. . .
Am I the only person in the
Bay Area who winces every time
Channel 7 newsman Jerry Jensen
turns slightly in his chair and
begins, "Well, Van, a tragic story
coming out of the East Bay
tonight...."?
Jensen, along with anchorman
Van Amburg, sportscaster John
O'Reilly and weatherman Pete
Giddings, comprise the cast of
KGO's News Scene, "the Bay
Area's award-winning news team"
(it won an Emmy last year) and
the top-ranked TV news program
in the area.
Long-time local viewers recall
that KGO, which is owned and
operated by ABC, was less than
spectacularly successful with a
series of anihormen in the 19605,
including ftoger Grimsby, now
kingpin of*the New York City
ratings on W ABC-TV, and Peter
Jennings, now ABC News'
excellent Mideast correspondent.
Sugar-Coated News
News Scene began to click with
the institution of what has
popularly become known as
"happy-talk" news. Judging from
the results broadcast onto local
screens, "happy talk" simply
means sugar-coating the news,
making it palatable for the lowest
common denominator, with little
jokes, asides and chatty bridges
between items. How can viewers
avoid feeling that they are held in
contempt by the show's
producers, who appear to aim the

program at a 12-year-old
mentality?
If there were just one such
station in San Francisco, there
would be less reason to complain
— we could simply watch another
station. But in the breakneck rush
for ratings, it appears that all
three commercial stations in the
City have landed on the same
bandwagon.

immediately apparent at

embarrassing — and Magers looks
like he's been embarrassed to do
it.
Only Late-Evening Entrants
For all intents and purposes,
KGO, KRON and KPIX are the
only entrants in the late evening
news sweepstakes. Cox
Broadcasting's KTVU in Oakland,
the only other local commercial
VHP station, comes on at 10 p.m.
Happy-talk producers point to
the ratings their stations have
gathered — but of course, if happy
talk is all there is, that's what will
take the ratings. KPIX was not a
not-too-distant second to KGO
in the ratings when it was still a
journalistically-respectable
operation and not a sideshow. It's
hard to believe that an
allegedly-cosmopolitan area like
San Francisco won't support a
good news team.
The biggest nightmare, of
course, is that the happy-talk
trend might spread to the
networks. God help us if Howard
K. Smith ever turns slightly in his
chair and begins, "Well, Harry, a
tragic story coming out of
Washington tonight. . .
Am I the only person in the
Bay Area who winces every time
Channel 7 newsman Jerry Jensen
turns slightly in his chair and
begins, "Well, Van, a tragic story
coming out of the East Bay
tonight...."?
Jensen, along with anchorman
Van Amburg, sportscaster John
O'Reilly and weatherman Pete
Giddings, comprise the cast of
KGO's News Scene, "the Bay
Area's award-winning news team"
(it won an Emmy last year) and
the top-ranked TV news program
in the area.
Long-time local viewers recall
that KGO, which is owned and
operated by ABC, was less than
spectacularly successful with a
series of anihormen in the 19605,
including ftoger Grimsby, now
kingpin of*the New York City
ratings on W ABC-TV, and Peter
Jennings, now ABC News'
excellent Mideast correspondent.
Sugar-Coated News
News Scene began to click with
the institution of what has
popularly become known as
"happy-talk" news. Judging from
the results broadcast onto local
screens, "happy talk" simply
means sugar-coating the news,
making it palatable for the lowest
common denominator, with little
jokes, asides and chatty bridges
between items. How can viewers
avoid feeling that they are held in
contempt by the show's
producers, who appear to aim the

program at a 12-year-old
mentality?
If there were just one such
station in San Francisco, there
would be less reason to complain
— we could simply watch another
station. But in the breakneck rush
for ratings, it appears that all
three commercial stations in the
City have landed on the same
bandwagon.
The trend has been most
immediately apparent at
KRON-TV, owned by the

Entertainment

Chronicle Publishing Corp. Ever
sihce bland veteran newscaster Art
Brown was discharged last year,
there has been a rush of KRON
anchormen, with the Phil Wilsons
replacing the Dave Valentines
replacing the Kevin McCulloughs
at a maddening pace.
Two weeks ago, KRON
introduced a new face, Fred
LaCosse from KNTV in San Jose,
as anchorman, and replaced
weatherperson Terry Lowry with
something named Jack McKenna,
who succeeds in making KPIX
(Channel 5) Eyewitness News
weatherperson Bob Lobertini look
almost intelligent.
LaCosse is pleasant enough,

and looks as though he might even
be a good newsman given the
chance. But McKenna and
sportscaster Eddie Alexander
range from the incoherent to the
unintelligible — Alexander mostly
because he talks a mile a minute.
And of course, the obligatory
"Good job, Jack" 'sand "Thanks,
Eddie" 'sand other side
comments eat time and distract
viewers who tuned in to get the
news, not watch a sensitivity
session.

Gradual Shift At KPIX
The change at Westinghouse
Broadcasting's KPIX — the best
news operation in the area as
recently as last year — has been
more insidious only because the
personnel shift has not been quite
as sudden as at KRON.
First, weatherman Leon
Hunsaker departed, succeeded this
past summer by the
above-mentioned Lobertini, a
grinning gargoyle imported from
Nashville, Tenn. at $70,000 a
year. Then co-anchorman Joe
Glover left, along with several
lower-level figures, in a shakeup
initiated by new news
directorship.
Word recently came down that

excellent sportscaster Barry
Tompkins is being replaced by
Milt Kahn, a Los Angeles radio
figure. And anchorman Ron
Magers, far and away the best in
the area, is now also said to be
leaving at the end of the month.
The material he's had to do in the
last few months has been
