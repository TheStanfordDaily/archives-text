# 'The Sting' Simple, Entertaining
## Newman, Redford Reunited 
### ED HARRIS 
The Sting has all the
ingredients of good
entertainment: an intriguing
story, big name actors, a wry
sense of humor, fine color
cinematography, a good score,
and convincing and unobtrusive
sets. It's a good film in the simple
sense, enjoyable but not
thought-provoking; it makes no
ideological points, plumbs no
emotional depths.
It is not a film you will want to
see more than once; the whole
interest of the film depends on
the twists and turns of its
ingenious plot and once the plot is

unravelled there is little left to the
film. (The plot is not all that
baffling; I figured out the last
twist in the scheme half an hour
before the end, but it still did not
lose any suspense for me.) But the
first time is well worth the price
of admission.
Robert Redford plays a
smalltime con artist who wants to
move on to Chicago to take a
crack at the "big con." He finds
himself forced to flee when his
black partner Lucas is rubbed out
by the mob, which is now hot on
his tail. In Chicago he meets
Henry Gondorf (Paul Newman),
an old hand at big-time rip-offs,
who is in the process of
concocting a scheme to cheat
mobster-financier Robert Shaw
(in the day of Maurice Stans and
Robert Vesco those terms are
almost equivalent) out of half a
cool million.
This is not quite the same
Butch-Cassidy-Sundance Kid
team; they are more serious and
reserved, less playful now.
However, with Newman as the
sly old pro and Redford the often
foolish novice, the chemistry is
the same and the' result equally
successful as their first film
together.
The Sting is a good example of
the new Hollywood morality, the
updated American Dream. Like

Peckinpah in The Getaway,
George Roy Hill has realized that
American audiences are too
sophisticated nowadays to
stomach the "crime-doesn't-pay"
morality plays which were so
popular in the heyday of J. Edgar
Hoover and Thomas E. Dewey.
The way to get rich quick
nowadays is to rip off gangsters; it
is all right to rob and kill people
who are already criminals anyway.
Of course there is more suspense
in this too. Given the well-known
ineffectiveness of the police, it is
more dangerous to steal from
gangsters than it is from honest
citizens. The courts only punish;
the mob retaliates.
Of all the films that have
capitalized on nostalgia, I
somehow found this one least
offensive in its exploitation of the
past. The past (the late 30s), is no
longer history but fantasy, a
tremendous funhouse where
convention and appearance are
turned on their heads. The
costumes are not imitations of
styles of the period, but costumes
in an enormous masquerade,
