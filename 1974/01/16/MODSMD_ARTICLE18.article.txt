# Shuffling The Cards
## Pac-8 Cage Notes 
### Dave Robinson 
Scoring-wise, Stanford's backcourt has hardly made opposing
oaches lose sleep and devise intricate defenses. The prevailing
strategy has been to virtually ignore Melvin Arterberry (4.7 scoring
average) and Mark Gilberg (1.4), while swarming over Stanford's big
rr>en.
Defensively, though, the Cardinal guards have been brilliant. Friday
night against USC, Stanford held the high-scoring Trojan tandem of
Gus Williams and Dan Anderson to 15 points total.
Saturday against UCLA, Tommy Curtis and Pete Trgovich managed
only 14 points, and last week Oregon superstar Ron Lee flipped in
only five field goals and four free throws at Maples — five points
below his average.
Overall, Stanford ranks third in the Pac-8 in team defense, trailing
UCLA and Oregon. The Cards trail everybody in team offense and
rank a disappointing sixth in rebounding margin.
Oregon's Ducks, who end every practice by forming a huddle and
shouting "DEFENSE" loud enough to cause a few more creaks at
ancient Mac Arthur Court, have used their watchword to reach the top
spot in the Pac-8 standings. Except for Saturday's shooting showdown
igainst Washington (the Ducks beat the Huskies 90-88), Oregon has
held Pac-8 opposition to a microscopic average of 47.7 points per
game.
The hottest individual in the conference is a 6-1 lVfe, 258 pound
monster from Chicago named Steve Puidokas, The 18 year-old
Washington State freshman leads the league in scoring with a 22.5
average, is tied with Stanford's Rich Kelley for second in rebounding
(11.3) and also ranks eighth in field goal percentage (.544).
Puidokas, whose favorite athlete is Dick Butkus (the WSU press
book is loaded with such tidbits of fascinating information), was "a
real shock" to Cougar coach George Raveling in early-season practices.
"He's a super pleasant surprise," Raveling said two weeks before
opening day. "He's as good as any freshman I've ever worked with."
And Raveling, who was an assistant at Maryland before heading to
Pullman, worked with Terrapin Ail-Americans Len Elmore and Tom
McMillen when they were frosh.

Several other freshmen are already making their marks in the
conference statistics. UCLA's Marques Johnson, billed as "another
Curtis Rowe in the making," leads the league in field goal percentage
(12-16, .750), while bruising Oregon forward Greg Ballard tops the
rebounding charts (12.5).
Another talented rookie, UCLA's Richard Washington, used to be a
seven-foot high school All-American. Now he's a 6-9 Bruin substitute.
"I guess I know how that seven-foot business got started,"
Washington said. "Our coach just had a measuring tape on the wall
and one day I measured seven feet. But it wasn't very accurate."
And his real height?
Washington replied with a figure exactly in the middle of his high
school roster and the UCLA press book — "6-10'/2."
Size notwithstanding, Washington, who along with Ralph
Drollinger played creditably at center Saturday in Bill Walton's
absence, doesn't have any far-reaching individual goals. He doesn't
care about scoring totals, winning streaks or All-America teams.
"My ultimate goal," he says, "is blocking one of Keith Wilkes'
shots in practice."
Walton, meanwhile, is still doubtful for this weekend's Bruin
clashes in the Midwest against lowa and Notre Dame — games that
could up the UCLA winning streak to 89 games. For those of you
who missed the news, victory number 100 is scheduled for Maples
Pavilion on March 2.

rr>en.
Defensively, though, the Cardinal guards have been brilliant. Friday
night against USC, Stanford held the high-scoring Trojan tandem of
Gus Williams and Dan Anderson to 15 points total.
Saturday against UCLA, Tommy Curtis and Pete Trgovich managed
only 14 points, and last week Oregon superstar Ron Lee flipped in
only five field goals and four free throws at Maples — five points
below his average.
Overall, Stanford ranks third in the Pac-8 in team defense, trailing
UCLA and Oregon. The Cards trail everybody in team offense and
rank a disappointing sixth in rebounding margin.
Oregon's Ducks, who end every practice by forming a huddle and
shouting "DEFENSE" loud enough to cause a few more creaks at
ancient Mac Arthur Court, have used their watchword to reach the top
spot in the Pac-8 standings. Except for Saturday's shooting showdown
igainst Washington (the Ducks beat the Huskies 90-88), Oregon has
held Pac-8 opposition to a microscopic average of 47.7 points per
game.
The hottest individual in the conference is a 6-1 lVfe, 258 pound
monster from Chicago named Steve Puidokas, The 18 year-old
Washington State freshman leads the league in scoring with a 22.5
average, is tied with Stanford's Rich Kelley for second in rebounding
(11.3) and also ranks eighth in field goal percentage (.544).
Puidokas, whose favorite athlete is Dick Butkus (the WSU press
book is loaded with such tidbits of fascinating information), was "a
real shock" to Cougar coach George Raveling in early-season practices.
"He's a super pleasant surprise," Raveling said two weeks before
opening day. "He's as good as any freshman I've ever worked with."
And Raveling, who was an assistant at Maryland before heading to
Pullman, worked with Terrapin Ail-Americans Len Elmore and Tom
McMillen when they were frosh.

Several other freshmen are already making their marks in the
conference statistics. UCLA's Marques Johnson, billed as "another
Curtis Rowe in the making," leads the league in field goal percentage
(12-16, .750), while bruising Oregon forward Greg Ballard tops the
rebounding charts (12.5).
Another talented rookie, UCLA's Richard Washington, used to be a
seven-foot high school All-American. Now he's a 6-9 Bruin substitute.
"I guess I know how that seven-foot business got started,"
Washington said. "Our coach just had a measuring tape on the wall
and one day I measured seven feet. But it wasn't very accurate."
And his real height?
Washington replied with a figure exactly in the middle of his high
school roster and the UCLA press book — "6-10'/2."
Size notwithstanding, Washington, who along with Ralph
Drollinger played creditably at center Saturday in Bill Walton's
absence, doesn't have any far-reaching individual goals. He doesn't
care about scoring totals, winning streaks or All-America teams.
"My ultimate goal," he says, "is blocking one of Keith Wilkes'
shots in practice."
Walton, meanwhile, is still doubtful for this weekend's Bruin
clashes in the Midwest against lowa and Notre Dame — games that
could up the UCLA winning streak to 89 games. For those of you
who missed the news, victory number 100 is scheduled for Maples
Pavilion on March 2.
