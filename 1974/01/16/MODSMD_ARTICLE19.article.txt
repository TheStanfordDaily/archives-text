# Northern Cal Invitationals
## Sierra Surprises Ski Team 
### 
Last weekend at Donner Ski
Ranch, the Stanford Ski team
finished second to surprisingly
strong Sierra college in the
nine-team Northern California
Invitationals.
Sierra won both Alpine events
(slalom and grand slalom), with
Stanford a close second. Stanford
won the jump, and Sierra cleaned
up in the cross country.
Saturday morning, Sierra took
the lead by placing racers first,
fourth and ninth over the short
grand slalom course. Stanford was
close behind as Dave Horth, Gary
Wright and Tom Hutton finished
fifth, sixth and eighth. Horth and
Hutton, thinking the course
would be faster than it really was,
skied high, conservative lines and
Wright took two gates wrong,
which slowed his otherwise fast
run.
Dave Andrews, skiing on new
skis and with almost no training,
finished a respectable 22nd. Phil
Barnes, after smoking through the
steep top section, hit a rut and fell
on the flat.
For the women, Lynn
Little field finished third and Lori
Gibson placed 13th despite an
early fall.
Saturday afternoon, Stanford
took the lead, winning the small
20-meter jump at Boreal. Andrews
hit the longest jump of the day,
but finished third because of
penalties for jumping on Alpine
skis instead of Nordics. Hutton
was fifth, Mark Colville 10th,
Frank Johns 17th and Ed
McKinley, who before the jump
had never gone more than four
m.p.h. except in a car, flew to a
26th place finish.
Sunday morning's two-run
slalom was very short, but also

very confusing. Skiers had to rely
on a start by a radio that was
intermittently audible, and only
about half the entrants finished.
Sierra again won, finishing second,
fourth and ninth, while Stanford
was second as Hutton skied
conservatively to a third place
individual finish.
Dave Horth's first run was the
most spectacular of the day, as he
skied through a series of about
three gates on his back. He went
on to finish fifth. Mark Colville
was 11th. For the women, Kathy
Frankland was fifth, Lori Gibson
seventh, Dee Gates eighth and
Helen Gordon 22nd.
Stanford brought a slight lead

into the cross country, but Sierra
cleaned up in that event, finishing
four runners in the top nine.
Meanwhile, Stanford's
inexperience and lack of training
showed, Colville's 14th being the
best Stanford finish.
Coaches Skip Stritter and Mike
Iker, who spent the weekend
racing grand slalom at Sugar Bowl,
feel cross country is sure to
improve as the runiwis work
themselves into better condition
and get more experience. Four of
the five Stanford runners had
never raced before.
Stanford continues its ski
schedule on Jan. 26-27 at the
Vanderbilt Cup at Squaw Valley.
