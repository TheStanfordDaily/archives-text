# Women Series Starts With Success Spiel
## 
### AMY SABRIN 
Women have to confront the
nervous anxiety they feel when they
deliberately set out to succeed.
That was the message of Nancy
Donham's talk to 25 women who
attended the first meeting of the
YWCA's Winter Sandwich Series
yesterday.
Donham, drawing on her
experiences as an academic affairs
writer for the University News Service,
spoke on "The Ambivalence of
Success."
Describing how she applied for a
job reclassification and a raise in pay,
Donham said she was nervous at the
possibility she might succeed. When
her job classification was finally
upgraded, she was hesitant to tell her
colleagues about it, especially men.
Theories
There are several theories to explain
why women fear the possibility of
succeeding, Donham said. One is that
success threatens a woman's feminine
self-image. "I just don't buy that
theory. I think they're nervous
because they realize the reality of
what's going to happen to them:
People will not like them.
"I discovered I was incredibly
reluctant to tell my male colleagues I
had been reclassified, and their
response was very hostile. That made
me nervous and I went around trying
to appease them," Donham said.
She reported other women were
"appalled by the idea that I asked to
be reclassified." Unlike men, "women
think if they just sit there quietly and
do a good job, they'll get promoted.
Women seem to be unaware of the
"hidden apprenticeship system" that
exists in most professional
organizations, Donham continued. She
described a system in which men
gravitate towards those in power who
are doing what they would like to
eventually do. "This is probably the
most important system for getting
ahead," she added.
"You have to tap the system
yourself. It's the best way to move
up," Donham advised. "Take yourself
seriously. Take your work seriously."
There's a step beyond deciding to
be liberated and going to work that
many women just don't take, Donham
said. They are "still in a quandry
about being a wife and having a career.
Very often women decide their job is
the thing in their life they are going to
do with their left hand," she said. She

added that this was a valid response
for women with heavy family
obligations.
Donham said women often tell her,
"I like my job because I don't have
any responsibility." The danger of this
attitude, according to Donham, is that
these women don't even assert
themselves to obtain the pay raises and
benefits which they are due, and
which they will not get unless they ask
for them.

deliberately set out to succeed.
That was the message of Nancy
Donham's talk to 25 women who
attended the first meeting of the
YWCA's Winter Sandwich Series
yesterday.
Donham, drawing on her
experiences as an academic affairs
writer for the University News Service,
spoke on "The Ambivalence of
Success."
Describing how she applied for a
job reclassification and a raise in pay,
Donham said she was nervous at the
possibility she might succeed. When
her job classification was finally
upgraded, she was hesitant to tell her
colleagues about it, especially men.
Theories
There are several theories to explain
why women fear the possibility of
succeeding, Donham said. One is that
success threatens a woman's feminine
self-image. "I just don't buy that
theory. I think they're nervous
because they realize the reality of
what's going to happen to them:
People will not like them.
"I discovered I was incredibly
reluctant to tell my male colleagues I
had been reclassified, and their
response was very hostile. That made
me nervous and I went around trying
to appease them," Donham said.
She reported other women were
"appalled by the idea that I asked to
be reclassified." Unlike men, "women
think if they just sit there quietly and
do a good job, they'll get promoted.
Women seem to be unaware of the
"hidden apprenticeship system" that
exists in most professional
organizations, Donham continued. She
described a system in which men
gravitate towards those in power who
are doing what they would like to
eventually do. "This is probably the
most important system for getting
ahead," she added.
"You have to tap the system
yourself. It's the best way to move
up," Donham advised. "Take yourself
seriously. Take your work seriously."
There's a step beyond deciding to
be liberated and going to work that
many women just don't take, Donham
said. They are "still in a quandry
about being a wife and having a career.
Very often women decide their job is
the thing in their life they are going to
do with their left hand," she said. She

added that this was a valid response
for women with heavy family
obligations.
Donham said women often tell her,
"I like my job because I don't have
any responsibility." The danger of this
attitude, according to Donham, is that
these women don't even assert
themselves to obtain the pay raises and
benefits which they are due, and
which they will not get unless they ask
for them.
Women have to confront the
nervous anxiety they feel when they
deliberately set out to succeed.
