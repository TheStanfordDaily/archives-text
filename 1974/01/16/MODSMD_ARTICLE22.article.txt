## Finley's Worrisome Winter 
### Don Tollefson 
A veteran Bay Area sports observer once claimed
that the Oakland Athletics didn't need a mule for a
mascot since they have an ass for an owner.
But in defense of Charlie Finley, he does deserve
some credit for making the off season of America's
dullest sport a little more exciting. And we
shouldn't forget that he was at least somewhat
responsible for bringing colorful uniforms, a
brilliant m?rager and eventually two world
championships to one of America's less notable
cities.
Ironically, some experts claim that the
dissension Finley caused within his organization
was one of the Athletics' main ingredients of
success. But in the last four months, the Finley
eccentricity which caused so much of that
dissension passed the point of diminishing returns.
Finley never learned his lesson and he is now on the
verge of leaving the baseball world as a despised and
broken man.
Finely, who became a sports patriarch after
fashioning a lucrative Midwest insurance business,
has always been a controversial figure in the
tradition-dominated world of baseball. Not many
people have ever loved him, but few have been able
to ignore him.
At the conclusion of the 1972 World Series,
Finely, his brilliant manager Dick Williams and
their wives embraced on the roof of a dugout in a
scene that was the picture of joy to millions of
American television viewers.
Silenced Critics
But although his A's would silence their critics
and win their second consecutive World Series this
past fall, Finley had little time to savor his victory.
Finley's rapid decline began on a sunny Sunday
afternoon in Oakland last October. Usually a
brilliant strategist, Williams made a rare blunder
that afternoon when he inserted sure-armed Mike
Andrews at second base and the seldomly-used
veteran committed two costly errors that allowed
the Mets to tie the Series at one game apiece.
Finley was incensed. He threw a tantrum
befitting a spoiled brat and forced Andrews to sign
a medical waiver that would place him on the
disabled list. Few people hesitated to call it an
outright firing.
By the time the World Champions arrived in
New York, they were on the verge of rebellion.
Rumors of a total strike were rampant, but the
players opted for the symbolism of wearing
Andrews' number in black on their uniforms during
a workout. One articulate player summed up his
teammates' feelings toward their owner; "Every
time I call him he's out walking his pet rat."
In an untypical display of guts, baseball
commissioner Bowie Kuhn called Finley's bluff and
reinstated Andrews. And when the beleaguered
second baseman entered the fourth Series game as a
pinch-hitter, 54,817 Shea Stadium spectators gave
him a tremendous ovation. As the applause
continued, TV cameras zoomed in on Finley, who
was laughing quietly. But inwardly you knew he

was bruised, not amused.
Finley's ego was undoubtedly damaged even
further by rumors that Williams was fed up and
ready to quit immediately following the Series. But
four days later, when the A's won it all again,
Finley seemed the picture of momentary
contentment. His statements contained some,
indirect, yet seemingly clear references to the fact
that Williams was free to leave the A's.
Williams didn't wait long to indicate his desire to
manage the Yankees. But just as quickly Finley
backed off from his previously announced "best
wishes!" For weeks, the rumors, charges and
counter-charges kept baseball in the news.
Finley could not be faulted for demanding
compensation for allowing Williams to leave with
two years left on his contract. But it was clear that
his earlier statements had been made in extreme
bad faith and it was hard to forgive him for that.
So Williams sat on a fence while the A's and
Yankees bartered, and lame-duck American League
President Joe Cronin did nothing. As if waiting for
divine guidance, Cronin let the entire situation
deteriorate into an ugly mess.
Contract Dispute
Then in mid-December, Williams announced that
he had actually signed with the Yankees. Finley
quickly filed suit in federal court to enjoin Williams
from managing the New Yorkers, but that action
became irrelevant when Cronin ruled that the
Yankees could not sign Williams unless the A's
released him.
Finley continued to negotiate with the Yankee
management over possible compensation for
releasing Williams, but the negotiations ended
fruitlessly and the New Yorkers signed Bill Virdon
to take the job Williams never really held. Despite
pleas from his players, Williams refuses to return
to Oakland and he has recently announced plans to
be an administrative aide to a wealthy Florida
developer during his exile from the sport.
But now it appears that all these complicated
hassles have taken a tremendous toll on Finley,
who has a history of heart trouble. Last week, he
announced that his doctors have advised him to sell
the A's, as well as the California Seals hockey team
and the Memphis Tams basketball club.
Skeptics feel that this may just be another
famous Finley play, but maybe Charlie has finally
realized that all his eccentric antics have inevitably
shortened his life. It's doubtful that his heart can
stand much more pressure.
So baseball may soon lose one of its greatest
managers, for at least a few years, and one of its
most controversial owners, forever. I never could
understand why as brilliant a judge of talent as
Finley wouldn't let Williams run his own show. But
he just couldn't keep his hand out of each and
every pie. It is hard to tell how baseball historians
will finally judge him; but it is certain that his
effect on the game won't soon be forgotten.
