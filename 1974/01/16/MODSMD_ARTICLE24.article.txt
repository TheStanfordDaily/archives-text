# JV Mauled At Merritt
## 
### 
Merritt College opened up an
early 24-12 lead and coasted to an
88-72 victory over Stanford's
junior varsity last night in
Oakland.
Hashiem Day scored 24 points
and Imani Martin added 23 as the
quick Merritt quintet literally ran
past the Cardinals. Stanford
threatened once when two free
throws by Mike Simons
(temporarily down from the
varsity) pulled the Cards within
seven at 69-62, but the Stanford
rally was short-lived.

Scott Russell led the JV
scoring with 17 points, while Sven
Walker added 16 and Simons
contributed 10.
Stanford, now 3-4 on the
season, is off for 10 days before
resuming its schedule on Jan. 25
against San Jose State.
