Oil Industry Regulation Saves Jobs?
WASHINGTON — The deputy director of the Federal
Energy Office said yesterday the nation's petroleum
industry has been placed under unprecedented federal
regulation to save jobs in the face of an energy crisis.
John Sawhill told newsmen the nation could expect to
have some 20 percent less gasoline than it otherwise could
use in early 1974, and the shortage could get worse by
summer if the Arab oil embargo against the United States
continues.
The new fuel allocation regulations, governing
distribution of major petroleum products and crude oil,
were signed into effect by Sawhill late Monday.
They impose fuel-oil cutbacks that require heating
reductions equivalent to six degrees below 1972 thermostat
settings in residences and 10 degrees below 1972 in other
buildings.
Israelis Evaluate Troop Pull-Back
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday that Israel was finding "constructive aspects"
to Cairo's proposal for disengagement of the Egyptian and
Israeli armies along the Suez Canal area.
But an Israeli Cabinet statement said later there would
be no final decision until after Kissinger makes another trip
to the Egyptian capital.
Foreign Minister Abba Eban, asked whether he agreed
with Kissinger's hopeful assessment, replied: "I would like
the Egyptians to see constructive aspects in our proposal."
In Aswan, an Egyptian government spokesman said it
had informed the Soviet Union yesterday of developments
in the talks between Kissinger and President Anwar Sadat.
Israeli sources suggested the disagreement between their
own withdrawal offer and the Egyptian plan was
considerable. Eban, in talking to newsmen, said negotiators
had gone over the Egyptian plan and map "in very great
detail and the talks were at "a delicate intermediate
stage."
Gas Rationing Plan Spelled Out
WASHINGTON — Gasoline coupons would be issued to
all licensed drivers at least 18 years old under the
government's proposed plan for rationing gasoline.
The proposed plan, spelled out yesterday by the Federal
Energy Office, was made public for discussion and
comment. There has been no decision whether rationing
will in fact be necessary.
Under the plan made public by energy chief William E.
Simon the number of coupons and, thus, the amount of
gasoline rationed to each individual, would depend on
residence.
Drivers living in areas with low population density would
get relatively more gasoline coupons and those in areas of
poor mass transit facilities would get more than those in
areas with well developed mass transit systems.
To give a rough idea about what this would mean, the
Federal Energy Office gave examples of possible situations
in which drivers might receive from 33 to 41 gallons of
gasoline per month if suppliers were tight and from 40 to
49 gallons per month if supplies were relatively ample.
The agency emphasized that these numbers were only
examples using hypothetical situations and were not
proposed as actual rationing levels.
The plan would apply only to gasoline sold in retail
service stations.
It would not apply to gasoline sold in bulk quantities or
to diesel fuel.
Bulk purchases of gasoline are controlled under the
mandatory petroleum allocation system which took effect
Monday night.
While the plan would distribute varying amounts of
coupons geographically, these coupons could be sold,
donated, or traded among individuals and there would thus
develop a market for buying and selling gasoline coupons.
That is part of the plan, allowing drivers who need more
gasoline to buy it at the prevailing price.
There would be no priorities entitling any individuals to
more gasoline coupons issued by the government than other
individuals in the same region.
Tunney Assails Gas Black Market
SACRAMENTO — Huge amounts of gasoline are being
funneled into a growing black market and the government
must find out who is behind it, Sen. John Tunney said
yesterday.
"I am convinced that there is a black market," the

California Democrat told a Capitol news conference.
He said he would hold hearings next week in San
Francisco and San Diego in an effort to find out where the
fuel is coming from and who is supplying it.
"It's my understanding that the suppliers are the ones
who are offering to sell oil and fuel at black market prices.
As to which suppliers, I would prefer to leave that answer
until the hearings," Tunney said.
He said he drew his information from"the literally
hundreds of conversations I have had" throughout the
state.
"I am basing my reflections and opinions on what I have
heard from people who are directly involved," he said.
"I met with the owner of a plastics factory in San
Francisco and he said he receives offers for black market
products all the time."
Tunney said his conversations with farmers, dock
workers and manufacturers also gave him "serious
suspicions" about the extent of the fuel crisis.
Social Security Taxes Criticized
WASHINGTON — A congressional economists' report
giving Social Security taxes part blame for last year's sharp
cost of living increase has fueled the argument over
changing the financing of the retirement system.
Rep. James A. Burke hailed the report published Sunday
as justification of his position that the general federal
treasury should take over some of the cost of Social
Security, now supported by payroll taxes on employers and
employees.
The Massachusetts Democrat, a senior member of the
House Ways and Means Committee, was unable to persuade
the committee last year to include such a provision in
Social Security legislation. He said in an interview he will
try again at the first opportunity.
The report by the staff of the Joint Economic
Committee concluded that the 1973 inflation was
extremely severe.
"The budget costs of consumers rose dramatically during
1973, primarily as a result of inflation, but to some extent
because of increased tax payments."
Ehrlichman Comments On Nixon
SEATTLE, Wash. — John Ehrlichman says President
Nixon has "a longer distance to travel now" than he did
five months ago in his efforts to win back Americans'
support.
Ehrlichman, Nixon's former chief domestic adviser, is
more subdued than he was during the summer about
Nixon's prospects for restoring public confidence in the
scandal-ridden administration.
It was last August, shortly after Ehrlichman finished his
testimony before the Senate Watergate committee and
moved back to the old family home on Lake Washington
that he said of the scandals:
"My sense of it is that the effect on the presidency is
short-ranged." He also said he expected Nixon to display a
fresh "force and vitality" to the office ... There's a
resiliency to the presidency that I think will be felt rather
soon."
State Income Refunds Estimated
SACRAMENTO — The average California taxpayer will
get a state income tax refund of $145 this year, state
officials estimated yesterday.
That is nearly double last year's average refunds of $78
dollars.
The State Franchise Tax Board also expects more
taxpayers to get refunds this year.
Board spokesman Doug Anderson said an estimated 5.5
million state taxpayers will be entitled to refunds totaling
$750 million this year on 1973 taxes.
Refunds totaling $369.1 million were issued last year to
4.7 million California taxpayers, he said.
The big reason for the increase is the one-time rebate
granted by Gov. Ronald Reagan and the 1973 legislature.
Thoe rebates excuse all state income taxes for individuals
earning $4000 or less and couples earning $8000 or less.
For higher income taxpayers, the rebates vary from 20 to
35 percent of the tax due.

gasoline rationed to each individual, would depend on
residence.
Drivers living in areas with low population density would
get relatively more gasoline coupons and those in areas of
poor mass transit facilities would get more than those in
areas with well developed mass transit systems.
To give a rough idea about what this would mean, the
Federal Energy Office gave examples of possible situations
in which drivers might receive from 33 to 41 gallons of
gasoline per month if suppliers were tight and from 40 to
49 gallons per month if supplies were relatively ample.
The agency emphasized that these numbers were only
examples using hypothetical situations and were not
proposed as actual rationing levels.
The plan would apply only to gasoline sold in retail
service stations.
It would not apply to gasoline sold in bulk quantities or
to diesel fuel.
Bulk purchases of gasoline are controlled under the
mandatory petroleum allocation system which took effect
Monday night.
While the plan would distribute varying amounts of
coupons geographically, these coupons could be sold,
donated, or traded among individuals and there would thus
develop a market for buying and selling gasoline coupons.
That is part of the plan, allowing drivers who need more
gasoline to buy it at the prevailing price.
There would be no priorities entitling any individuals to
more gasoline coupons issued by the government than other
individuals in the same region.
Tunney Assails Gas Black Market
SACRAMENTO — Huge amounts of gasoline are being
funneled into a growing black market and the government
must find out who is behind it, Sen. John Tunney said
yesterday.
"I am convinced that there is a black market," the

California Democrat told a Capitol news conference.
He said he would hold hearings next week in San
Francisco and San Diego in an effort to find out where the
fuel is coming from and who is supplying it.
"It's my understanding that the suppliers are the ones
who are offering to sell oil and fuel at black market prices.
As to which suppliers, I would prefer to leave that answer
until the hearings," Tunney said.
He said he drew his information from"the literally
hundreds of conversations I have had" throughout the
state.
"I am basing my reflections and opinions on what I have
heard from people who are directly involved," he said.
"I met with the owner of a plastics factory in San
Francisco and he said he receives offers for black market
products all the time."
Tunney said his conversations with farmers, dock
workers and manufacturers also gave him "serious
suspicions" about the extent of the fuel crisis.
Social Security Taxes Criticized
WASHINGTON — A congressional economists' report
giving Social Security taxes part blame for last year's sharp
cost of living increase has fueled the argument over
changing the financing of the retirement system.
Rep. James A. Burke hailed the report published Sunday
as justification of his position that the general federal
treasury should take over some of the cost of Social
Security, now supported by payroll taxes on employers and
employees.
The Massachusetts Democrat, a senior member of the
House Ways and Means Committee, was unable to persuade
the committee last year to include such a provision in
Social Security legislation. He said in an interview he will
try again at the first opportunity.
The report by the staff of the Joint Economic
Committee concluded that the 1973 inflation was
extremely severe.
"The budget costs of consumers rose dramatically during
1973, primarily as a result of inflation, but to some extent
because of increased tax payments."
Ehrlichman Comments On Nixon
SEATTLE, Wash. — John Ehrlichman says President
Nixon has "a longer distance to travel now" than he did
five months ago in his efforts to win back Americans'
support.
Ehrlichman, Nixon's former chief domestic adviser, is
more subdued than he was during the summer about
Nixon's prospects for restoring public confidence in the
scandal-ridden administration.
It was last August, shortly after Ehrlichman finished his
testimony before the Senate Watergate committee and
moved back to the old family home on Lake Washington
that he said of the scandals:
"My sense of it is that the effect on the presidency is
short-ranged." He also said he expected Nixon to display a
fresh "force and vitality" to the office ... There's a
resiliency to the presidency that I think will be felt rather
soon."
State Income Refunds Estimated
SACRAMENTO — The average California taxpayer will
get a state income tax refund of $145 this year, state
officials estimated yesterday.
That is nearly double last year's average refunds of $78
dollars.
The State Franchise Tax Board also expects more
taxpayers to get refunds this year.
Board spokesman Doug Anderson said an estimated 5.5
million state taxpayers will be entitled to refunds totaling
$750 million this year on 1973 taxes.
Refunds totaling $369.1 million were issued last year to
4.7 million California taxpayers, he said.
The big reason for the increase is the one-time rebate
granted by Gov. Ronald Reagan and the 1973 legislature.
Thoe rebates excuse all state income taxes for individuals
earning $4000 or less and couples earning $8000 or less.
For higher income taxpayers, the rebates vary from 20 to
35 percent of the tax due.

Oil Industry Regulation Saves Jobs?
WASHINGTON — The deputy director of the Federal
Energy Office said yesterday the nation's petroleum
industry has been placed under unprecedented federal
regulation to save jobs in the face of an energy crisis.
John Sawhill told newsmen the nation could expect to
have some 20 percent less gasoline than it otherwise could
use in early 1974, and the shortage could get worse by
summer if the Arab oil embargo against the United States
continues.
The new fuel allocation regulations, governing
distribution of major petroleum products and crude oil,
were signed into effect by Sawhill late Monday.
They impose fuel-oil cutbacks that require heating
reductions equivalent to six degrees below 1972 thermostat
settings in residences and 10 degrees below 1972 in other
buildings.
Israelis Evaluate Troop Pull-Back
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday that Israel was finding "constructive aspects"
to Cairo's proposal for disengagement of the Egyptian and
Israeli armies along the Suez Canal area.
But an Israeli Cabinet statement said later there would
be no final decision until after Kissinger makes another trip
to the Egyptian capital.
Foreign Minister Abba Eban, asked whether he agreed
with Kissinger's hopeful assessment, replied: "I would like
the Egyptians to see constructive aspects in our proposal."
In Aswan, an Egyptian government spokesman said it
had informed the Soviet Union yesterday of developments
in the talks between Kissinger and President Anwar Sadat.
Israeli sources suggested the disagreement between their
own withdrawal offer and the Egyptian plan was
considerable. Eban, in talking to newsmen, said negotiators
had gone over the Egyptian plan and map "in very great
detail and the talks were at "a delicate intermediate
stage."

products all the time."
Tunney said his conversations with farmers, dock
workers and manufacturers also gave him "serious

Social Security Taxes Criticized
WASHINGTON — A congressional economists' report
giving Social Security taxes part blame for last year's sharp
cost of living increase has fueled the argument over
changing the financing of the retirement system.
Rep. James A. Burke hailed the report published Sunday
as justification of his position that the general federal
treasury should take over some of the cost of Social
Security, now supported by payroll taxes on employers and
employees.
The Massachusetts Democrat, a senior member of the
House Ways and Means Committee, was unable to persuade
the committee last year to include such a provision in
Social Security legislation. He said in an interview he will
try again at the first opportunity.
The report by the staff of the Joint Economic
Committee concluded that the 1973 inflation was
extremely severe.
"The budget costs of consumers rose dramatically during
1973, primarily as a result of inflation, but to some extent
because of increased tax payments."
Ehrlichman Comments On Nixon
SEATTLE, Wash. — John Ehrlichman says President
Nixon has "a longer distance to travel now" than he did
five months ago in his efforts to win back Americans'
support.
Ehrlichman, Nixon's former chief domestic adviser, is
more subdued than he was during the summer about
Nixon's prospects for restoring public confidence in the
scandal-ridden administration.
It was last August, shortly after Ehrlichman finished his
testimony before the Senate Watergate committee and
moved back to the old family home on Lake Washington
that he said of the scandals:
"My sense of it is that the effect on the presidency is
short-ranged." He also said he expected Nixon to display a
fresh "force and vitality" to the office ... There's a
resiliency to the presidency that I think will be felt rather
soon."
State Income Refunds Estimated
SACRAMENTO — The average California taxpayer will
get a state income tax refund of $145 this year, state
officials estimated yesterday.
That is nearly double last year's average refunds of $78
dollars.
The State Franchise Tax Board also expects more
taxpayers to get refunds this year.
Board spokesman Doug Anderson said an estimated 5.5
million state taxpayers will be entitled to refunds totaling
$750 million this year on 1973 taxes.
Refunds totaling $369.1 million were issued last year to
4.7 million California taxpayers, he said.
The big reason for the increase is the one-time rebate
granted by Gov. Ronald Reagan and the 1973 legislature.
Thoe rebates excuse all state income taxes for individuals
earning $4000 or less and couples earning $8000 or less.
For higher income taxpayers, the rebates vary from 20 to
35 percent of the tax due.

Oil Industry Regulation Saves Jobs?
WASHINGTON — The deputy director of the Federal
Energy Office said yesterday the nation's petroleum
industry has been placed under unprecedented federal
regulation to save jobs in the face of an energy crisis.
John Sawhill told newsmen the nation could expect to
have some 20 percent less gasoline than it otherwise could
use in early 1974, and the shortage could get worse by
summer if the Arab oil embargo against the United States
continues.
The new fuel allocation regulations, governing
distribution of major petroleum products and crude oil,
were signed into effect by Sawhill late Monday.
They impose fuel-oil cutbacks that require heating
reductions equivalent to six degrees below 1972 thermostat
settings in residences and 10 degrees below 1972 in other
buildings.
Israelis Evaluate Troop Pull-Back
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday that Israel was finding "constructive aspects"
to Cairo's proposal for disengagement of the Egyptian and
Israeli armies along the Suez Canal area.
But an Israeli Cabinet statement said later there would
be no final decision until after Kissinger makes another trip
to the Egyptian capital.
Foreign Minister Abba Eban, asked whether he agreed
with Kissinger's hopeful assessment, replied: "I would like
the Egyptians to see constructive aspects in our proposal."
In Aswan, an Egyptian government spokesman said it
had informed the Soviet Union yesterday of developments
in the talks between Kissinger and President Anwar Sadat.
Israeli sources suggested the disagreement between their
own withdrawal offer and the Egyptian plan was
considerable. Eban, in talking to newsmen, said negotiators
had gone over the Egyptian plan and map "in very great
detail and the talks were at "a delicate intermediate
stage."
Gas Rationing Plan Spelled Out
WASHINGTON — Gasoline coupons would be issued to
all licensed drivers at least 18 years old under the
government's proposed plan for rationing gasoline.
The proposed plan, spelled out yesterday by the Federal
Energy Office, was made public for discussion and
comment. There has been no decision whether rationing
will in fact be necessary.
Under the plan made public by energy chief William E.
Simon the number of coupons and, thus, the amount of
gasoline rationed to each individual, would depend on
residence.
Drivers living in areas with low population density would
get relatively more gasoline coupons and those in areas of
poor mass transit facilities would get more than those in
areas with well developed mass transit systems.
To give a rough idea about what this would mean, the
Federal Energy Office gave examples of possible situations
in which drivers might receive from 33 to 41 gallons of
gasoline per month if suppliers were tight and from 40 to
49 gallons per month if supplies were relatively ample.
The agency emphasized that these numbers were only
examples using hypothetical situations and were not
proposed as actual rationing levels.
The plan would apply only to gasoline sold in retail
service stations.
It would not apply to gasoline sold in bulk quantities or
to diesel fuel.
Bulk purchases of gasoline are controlled under the
mandatory petroleum allocation system which took effect
Monday night.
While the plan would distribute varying amounts of
coupons geographically, these coupons could be sold,
donated, or traded among individuals and there would thus
develop a market for buying and selling gasoline coupons.
That is part of the plan, allowing drivers who need more
gasoline to buy it at the prevailing price.
There would be no priorities entitling any individuals to
more gasoline coupons issued by the government than other
individuals in the same region.
Tunney Assails Gas Black Market
SACRAMENTO — Huge amounts of gasoline are being
funneled into a growing black market and the government
must find out who is behind it, Sen. John Tunney said
yesterday.
"I am convinced that there is a black market," the

California Democrat told a Capitol news conference.
He said he would hold hearings next week in San
Francisco and San Diego in an effort to find out where the
fuel is coming from and who is supplying it.
"It's my understanding that the suppliers are the ones
who are offering to sell oil and fuel at black market prices.
As to which suppliers, I would prefer to leave that answer
until the hearings," Tunney said.
He said he drew his information from"the literally
hundreds of conversations I have had" throughout the
state.
"I am basing my reflections and opinions on what I have
heard from people who are directly involved," he said.
"I met with the owner of a plastics factory in San

SACRAMENTO — The average California taxpayer will
get a state income tax refund of $145 this year, state
officials estimated yesterday.
That is nearly double last year's average refunds of $78
dollars.
The State Franchise Tax Board also expects more
taxpayers to get refunds this year.
Board spokesman Doug Anderson said an estimated 5.5
million state taxpayers will be entitled to refunds totaling
$750 million this year on 1973 taxes.
Refunds totaling $369.1 million were issued last year to
4.7 million California taxpayers, he said.
The big reason for the increase is the one-time rebate
granted by Gov. Ronald Reagan and the 1973 legislature.
Thoe rebates excuse all state income taxes for individuals
earning $4000 or less and couples earning $8000 or less.
For higher income taxpayers, the rebates vary from 20 to
35 percent of the tax due.

Oil Industry Regulation Saves Jobs?
WASHINGTON — The deputy director of the Federal
Energy Office said yesterday the nation's petroleum
industry has been placed under unprecedented federal
regulation to save jobs in the face of an energy crisis.
John Sawhill told newsmen the nation could expect to
have some 20 percent less gasoline than it otherwise could
use in early 1974, and the shortage could get worse by
summer if the Arab oil embargo against the United States
continues.
The new fuel allocation regulations, governing
distribution of major petroleum products and crude oil,
were signed into effect by Sawhill late Monday.
They impose fuel-oil cutbacks that require heating
reductions equivalent to six degrees below 1972 thermostat
settings in residences and 10 degrees below 1972 in other
buildings.
Israelis Evaluate Troop Pull-Back
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday that Israel was finding "constructive aspects"
to Cairo's proposal for disengagement of the Egyptian and
Israeli armies along the Suez Canal area.
But an Israeli Cabinet statement said later there would
be no final decision until after Kissinger makes another trip
to the Egyptian capital.
Foreign Minister Abba Eban, asked whether he agreed
with Kissinger's hopeful assessment, replied: "I would like
the Egyptians to see constructive aspects in our proposal."
In Aswan, an Egyptian government spokesman said it
had informed the Soviet Union yesterday of developments
in the talks between Kissinger and President Anwar Sadat.
Israeli sources suggested the disagreement between their
own withdrawal offer and the Egyptian plan was
considerable. Eban, in talking to newsmen, said negotiators
had gone over the Egyptian plan and map "in very great
detail and the talks were at "a delicate intermediate
stage."
Gas Rationing Plan Spelled Out
WASHINGTON — Gasoline coupons would be issued to
all licensed drivers at least 18 years old under the
government's proposed plan for rationing gasoline.
The proposed plan, spelled out yesterday by the Federal
Energy Office, was made public for discussion and
comment. There has been no decision whether rationing
will in fact be necessary.
Under the plan made public by energy chief William E.
Simon the number of coupons and, thus, the amount of
gasoline rationed to each individual, would depend on
residence.
Drivers living in areas with low population density would
get relatively more gasoline coupons and those in areas of
poor mass transit facilities would get more than those in
areas with well developed mass transit systems.
To give a rough idea about what this would mean, the
Federal Energy Office gave examples of possible situations
in which drivers might receive from 33 to 41 gallons of
gasoline per month if suppliers were tight and from 40 to
49 gallons per month if supplies were relatively ample.
The agency emphasized that these numbers were only
examples using hypothetical situations and were not
proposed as actual rationing levels.
The plan would apply only to gasoline sold in retail
service stations.
It would not apply to gasoline sold in bulk quantities or
to diesel fuel.
Bulk purchases of gasoline are controlled under the
mandatory petroleum allocation system which took effect
Monday night.
While the plan would distribute varying amounts of
coupons geographically, these coupons could be sold,
donated, or traded among individuals and there would thus
develop a market for buying and selling gasoline coupons.
That is part of the plan, allowing drivers who need more
gasoline to buy it at the prevailing price.
There would be no priorities entitling any individuals to
more gasoline coupons issued by the government than other
individuals in the same region.
Tunney Assails Gas Black Market
SACRAMENTO — Huge amounts of gasoline are being
funneled into a growing black market and the government
must find out who is behind it, Sen. John Tunney said
yesterday.
"I am convinced that there is a black market," the

California Democrat told a Capitol news conference.
He said he would hold hearings next week in San
Francisco and San Diego in an effort to find out where the
fuel is coming from and who is supplying it.
"It's my understanding that the suppliers are the ones
who are offering to sell oil and fuel at black market prices.
As to which suppliers, I would prefer to leave that answer
until the hearings," Tunney said.
He said he drew his information from"the literally
hundreds of conversations I have had" throughout the
state.
"I am basing my reflections and opinions on what I have
heard from people who are directly involved," he said.
"I met with the owner of a plastics factory in San
Francisco and he said he receives offers for black market
products all the time."
Tunney said his conversations with farmers, dock
workers and manufacturers also gave him "serious
suspicions" about the extent of the fuel crisis.
Social Security Taxes Criticized
WASHINGTON — A congressional economists' report
giving Social Security taxes part blame for last year's sharp
cost of living increase has fueled the argument over
changing the financing of the retirement system.
Rep. James A. Burke hailed the report published Sunday
as justification of his position that the general federal
treasury should take over some of the cost of Social
Security, now supported by payroll taxes on employers and
employees.
The Massachusetts Democrat, a senior member of the
House Ways and Means Committee, was unable to persuade
the committee last year to include such a provision in
Social Security legislation. He said in an interview he will
try again at the first opportunity.
The report by the staff of the Joint Economic
Committee concluded that the 1973 inflation was
extremely severe.
"The budget costs of consumers rose dramatically during
1973, primarily as a result of inflation, but to some extent
because of increased tax payments."
Ehrlichman Comments On Nixon
SEATTLE, Wash. — John Ehrlichman says President
Nixon has "a longer distance to travel now" than he did
five months ago in his efforts to win back Americans'
support.
Ehrlichman, Nixon's former chief domestic adviser, is
more subdued than he was during the summer about
Nixon's prospects for restoring public confidence in the
scandal-ridden administration.
It was last August, shortly after Ehrlichman finished his
testimony before the Senate Watergate committee and
moved back to the old family home on Lake Washington
that he said of the scandals:
"My sense of it is that the effect on the presidency is
short-ranged." He also said he expected Nixon to display a
fresh "force and vitality" to the office ... There's a
resiliency to the presidency that I think will be felt rather
soon."
