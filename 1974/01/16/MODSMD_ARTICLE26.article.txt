machines visible through the large
plate glass windows of the lobby.
Their clothes and hands lack the
usual coating of black ink and grease
so characteristic in the newspaper
trade.
The walls of the room are a clean
yellow and the floors are unlittered.
No one seems to talk much. And no
one swears.

Road, the Journal printers are quietly

Jones & Co., Inc. and has its executive
headquarters in New York City, is

craft people.

Phillips. "One of the reasons we chose
the Stanford Industrial Park was
because of the cheerful surroundings."
The closest newsgathering offices of
the Journal are in San Francisco.

facsimile through telephone lines to
Chikapee, Mass., where it is punched
onto computer tape.
It then makes one more journey
through the phone lines to a master
computer in South Brunswick, N.J.
where it is stored, and each story is
ranked in importance. There is awaits
summons from the Journal's four
regional offices.
