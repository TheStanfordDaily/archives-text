## Ruetz, KSFO To Talk 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz has
agreed to talk with representatives of
KSFO, a San Francisco-based radio
station, in order to attempt to work
out a compromise concerning KZSU's
right to broadcast Stanford basketball
games.
Ruetz and other Athletic
Department officials met with
representatives of KZSU and the
administration yesterday to discuss the
problems created by the broadcasts,
and possible solutions.
Although no definite decisions were
made, KZSU Station Manager Gary
Fazzino said he was confident the
issue could be resolved.
The problems center around airing
of the games by the Stanford station
in violation of a contract between the

Athletic Department and KSFO.
The contract forbids the
Department from granting broadcast
rights for football and basketball
games to any other radio station in
nine Bay Area counties, including
Santa Clara.
Fazzino said that KZSU has agreed
to suspend broadcasts for now,
pending the discussions between Ruetz
and KSFO Operations Director Robert
Hansen.
The station halted the broadcasts
when the controversy surfaced in late
December, and may not do another
game this season, depending on the
results of the negotiations.
Ruetz promised to start talks with
KSFO "as soon as possible," but,
because of the complexity of the
situation and the money involved, it
could be a while before any
compromise is reached.
KSFO pays Stanford $28,000 for
the broadcast rights. Ruetz said the
contract is "important to Stanford"
and he must protect that contract
while presenting KZSU's arguments
for airing the games.
Ruetz emphasized that his relations
with both stations are good, and
although he didn't sound as confident
as Fazzino, he seemed determined to
work out a mutually satisfactory
decision. Fazzino said that "Ruetz is a
very good friend of ours," and
appeared happy with the results of the
meeting.
The outcome of the compromise
discussions may depend greatly on
how much KSFO representatives
believe the KZSU broadcasts detract

from its listening audience, and how
much KSFO's advertisers care about
the situation.
KSFO lost one of its sponsors, an
oil company, this year and "is
operating at a very thin margin,"
Ruetz wrote in a letter last month to
then-KZSU Station Manager Lloyd
Snook.
"Anything that would further
complicate the terms of the written
contract would probably cause us to
lose what we have," it added. The
letter also stated that Stanford, as a
University, "is unique in this Northern
California area in having radio
coverage and an income source on
such favorable terms."

Hansen.
The station halted the broadcasts
when the controversy surfaced in late
December, and may not do another
game this season, depending on the
results of the negotiations.
Ruetz promised to start talks with
KSFO "as soon as possible," but,
because of the complexity of the
situation and the money involved, it
could be a while before any
compromise is reached.
KSFO pays Stanford $28,000 for
the broadcast rights. Ruetz said the
contract is "important to Stanford"
and he must protect that contract
while presenting KZSU's arguments
for airing the games.
Ruetz emphasized that his relations
with both stations are good, and
although he didn't sound as confident
as Fazzino, he seemed determined to
work out a mutually satisfactory
decision. Fazzino said that "Ruetz is a
very good friend of ours," and
appeared happy with the results of the
meeting.
The outcome of the compromise
discussions may depend greatly on
how much KSFO representatives
believe the KZSU broadcasts detract

from its listening audience, and how
much KSFO's advertisers care about
the situation.
KSFO lost one of its sponsors, an
oil company, this year and "is
operating at a very thin margin,"
Ruetz wrote in a letter last month to
then-KZSU Station Manager Lloyd
Snook.
"Anything that would further
complicate the terms of the written
contract would probably cause us to
lose what we have," it added. The
letter also stated that Stanford, as a
University, "is unique in this Northern
California area in having radio
coverage and an income source on
such favorable terms."
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz has
agreed to talk with representatives of
KSFO, a San Francisco-based radio
station, in order to attempt to work
out a compromise concerning KZSU's
right to broadcast Stanford basketball
games.
Ruetz and other Athletic
Department officials met with
representatives of KZSU and the
administration yesterday to discuss the
problems created by the broadcasts,
and possible solutions.
Although no definite decisions were
made, KZSU Station Manager Gary
Fazzino said he was confident the
issue could be resolved.
The problems center around airing
of the games by the Stanford station
in violation of a contract between the

Athletic Department and KSFO.
The contract forbids the
Department from granting broadcast
rights for football and basketball
games to any other radio station in
nine Bay Area counties, including
Santa Clara.
Fazzino said that KZSU has agreed
to suspend broadcasts for now,
pending the discussions between Ruetz
and KSFO Operations Director Robert
Hansen.
