# Losing Pounds Is No Picnic
## Pudgies Try Diets, Spas 
### CAROL KENDRICK 
Fad diets, easy reducing plans, health spas and popular
literature all exhort Americans to be thin. Sugar-free soft
drinks, diet meals, appetite suppressors — everything from
diet soup to low calorie nuts emphasize a national
preoccupation with fat.
Seventy-nine million fat Americans spend $10 billion a
year on reducing aids. The results vary, but optimistic
claims and counter-claims abound.
"People are exploiting the obese. Everybody's got a
gimmick," said Barbara Brown, secretary of
"Counterweight," a weight reduction program being
market-tested in Palo Alto by General Mills.
Describing her program as a "personalized alternate day
eating system," she criticized the "pounds lost painlessly or
your money back" approach to overweight.
Counterweight is based on a conservative, nutritionally
balanced diet, combining one day of strict dieting with one
day of moderate caloric intake.
Discussions
For a $10 registration fee and $3 per weekly session,
members meet and discuss their weight problems.
According to Brown, the group is about 85 percent women
— most needing to lose between 20 and 50 pounds.
Counterweight's slogan is "Learn how to eat, not how to
diet." Their brochure asks, "Who can't diet for one day at a
time?"
For many, drastic dieting is a less demanding procedure
than prolonged sensible eating. To the banana hot fudge
sundae addict, a balanced diet can be the most extreme
torture.
Education
But according to Dr. John Schroeder, assistant professor
of medicine in cardiology here, the most successful dieting
program is educationally oriented, aimed at teaching proper
everyday eating activities.
Schroeder said most Americans are 10 to 20 pounds
overweight. Americans eat too much rich food, don't get
enough exercise and, perhaps consequently, have the
highest heart attack rate in the world.
Stanford Hospital is studying the problem of eating
habits and their relation to heart disease in a patient
re-education program. All patients at the hospital are now
fed low-fat menus during their stay. According to a

preliminary follow-up of discharged patients, "it looks like
50 percent are making some modification in diet," said
Schroeder.
New Habits
Awareness of the consequences of poor eating patterns is
the first step in establishing new habits, both for general
health and for weight control.
As a health phenomenon, Schroder said that even food
faddism, like the health food craze, is encouraging because,
at least, it "means people are interested in nutrition."
He said it is gratifying to lose weight fast, perhaps
starting out on a 500 calorie-a-day diet if you are healthy.
But he said one must remain conscious of the dangers to
health. He added that one can lose about two pounds a
week at most. "Anyone who promises more is selling false
hope."
Dangerous
Schroeder is especially critical of the Atkins Diet, a low
carbohydrate, high fat diet popularized by Dr. Robert
Atkirts. The AMA has attacked this diet as potentially
dangerous.
Schroeder cited both short and long-term hazards of the
Atkins diet and others like it. The immediate effects of a
poorly balanced starvation diet may be abnormalities in the
blood, degeneration of muscle and organ tissue, and vitamin
deficiency, he said.
Schroeder said theories about dieting are often
conflicting. It is also unclear exactly what role exercise
should play in weight reduction. To lose one pound, a
person has to take in 3500 calories less than he needs.
"Exercise is a terrible way to lose weight," ventured
Schroeder. "It takes 15 minutes of running to burn off one
apple."
Physique
Nevertheless, a great number of health clubs and spas
have sprung up to cater to the popular concern with fitness
and physique. Schroeder explained that health spas are a
bargain if they are used conscientiously. They do stimulate
body building and muscle tone.
In Palo Alto, there are several reducing centers,
luxuriously equipped with massage machines, muscle
builders, saunas, steam rooms and swimming pools.
Carrie Liepke, service coordinator of the Spa Fitness
Center, said that men generally are more interested in
converting flab to muscle while women try to lose pounds
and slim down.
