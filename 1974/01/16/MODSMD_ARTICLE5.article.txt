# At Least Five Erasures Discovered In Tape Gap
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
18-minute gap on a key White House
tape was made by someone pushing
the record-erase button at least five
separate times, a panel of technical
experts testified yesterday. They were
not permitted to say whether the acts
were deliberate.
James D. St. Clair, a new White
House attorney in the Watergate tape
controversy, objected to all questions
leading to any conclusion on whether
the tape could have been purposely
erased.
President Nixon's secretary, Rose
Mary Woods, had testified in
November that she accidentally
pushed the record button while
transcribing the tape, but for no longer
than five minutes.
The experts said any speech that
had been on the tape cannot be
recovered.

The recording, one of nine
subpoenaed by the Special Watergate
prosecutor, was of a conversation
between Nixon and H.R. Haldeman on
June 20, 1972 — three days after the
break-in at Democratic party
headquarters.
18-Minute Gap
The 18-minute gap, showing as a
loud buzz, apparently obliterated the
conversation about Watergate that
took place at that time according to
Haldeman's notes.
"The buzzing sounds were put on
the tape in the process of erasing and
re-recording at least five, and perhaps
as many as nine, separate and
continuous segments," said the report
by six experts chosen jointly by the
White House and the special
prosecutor.
"The 18.5 minute section could not
have been produced by any single,
continuous operation ... the
recording controls must have been
operated by hand in the making of
each segment."
The experts said they came to their
conclusions by the appearance of
"signatures" — magnetic marks left on
the tape when the erase head lifts off.
Thomas G. Stockham, a professor
of computer science at the University
of Utah, was asked whether it was
likely the marks "were caused
accidentally or inadvertently."
St. Clair objected that Stockham
was not qualified to reply.
"Suppose someone listening to the
tape with no intention to erase the
obliterated section," asked assistant
prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste. "Is it
likely ... that five stops and starts
could have been accidentally made
without the person listening to the
tape knowing that occurred?"
Again St. Clair objected and the
question went unanswered.
"The total evidence ... clearly

indicates somehow at some time this
particular tape was energized and
de-energized through a manual
operation," Stockham said. "I have no
idea when it occurred or who is
responsible, but it occurred after the
original tape was made."
Even U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica ran into St. Clair's objections
when he asked "can you say with any
degree of certainty ... whether it was
caused by accident or deliberately
done?"
Eventually the judge will decide on
any further action to be taken in the
case. He has the option of turning the
matter over to a grand jury.
Miss Woods' attorney, Charles
Rhyne, also contributed his share of
objections.
"We have no view who did what for
what reason," said another expert,
Richard Bolt, a former professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
how now heads his own research firm.
'Potentially Damaging'
The experts' report was described
as "potentially damaging" by Sen.
Howard Baker of Tennessee, the
ranking Republican on the Senate
Watergate Committee.
After the hearing, Ben-Veniste was
asked whether he will pursue the
question of whether the erasure was
deliberate when the experts return to
court Friday.
"I think the point has been made,"
he said without elaboration.
St. Clair was overheard after court
telling Bolt that the White House
might summon its own experts.
"I thought we were your experts,"
Bolt said heatedly. In earlier stages of
the hearing, which was recessed Dec.
6, the prosecution at times had an
expert at its counsel table.
St. Clair told newsmen he made it a
practice not to comment on a case
while it was in court.
