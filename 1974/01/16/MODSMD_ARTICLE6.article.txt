# Energy Institute Established
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Prof. William Reynolds, chairman
of the Mechanical Engineering
Department, yesterday announced the
formation of a new Institute for
Energy Studies to serve as "a central
focus for the energy activities that we
have on campus."
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Reynolds said that the
institute "grew out of a study that we
made here last summer to see what
was going on in the energy area. We
found an awful lot of stuff and
decided to give it some external
visibility and cohesiveness."
The Institute for Energy Studies,
which Reynolds will head, will provide

some support for individual research
by University faculty and will seek
funds from private foundations for
additional research. In addition, the
institute is sponsoring an energy
seminar and co-sponsoring an
engineering class studying, among
other energy alternatives, the
possibility of tapping solar energy
through agricultural production.
Initial funding for the institute
came from the School of Engineering,
which gave the organizers $10,000 last
summer. Since then, the institute has
received grants of $25,000 from the
General Electric Foundation and
$20,000 from a major oil company.
Both grants will be renewed for the
same amounts every year, for the next
five years.
Speaking in general terms about the
energy crisis, Reynolds said that
although the current problem is
serious, "The accumulation of
circumstance has probably made the
problem seem worse than it really is."
He added that research at the
University would not effect the
immediate oil shortage, and that the
institute would deal with the long
term dilemma — the depletion of fossil
energy sources.
Reynolds indicated that the United
States has enough coal to power its

economy for a number of decades, but
when coal reserves are gone, the real
energy crisis will begin.
"We are going to run out of fossil
fuels [oil, coal and natural gas]," he
said. "The only real question is
when ... and what do we do after
that."
Reynolds said that nuclear energy is
not a feasible alternative because it is
difficult to transport power from
reactors to homes. He also said that
"estimates of nuclear reserves vary,
but the people who think seriously
about this, I believe, feel that nuclear
energy is something that might carry
us 100 or 200 years at the most."
A much more likely alternative is
solar energy in the form of agricultural
products. Certain high energy yield
crops, such as sugar beets, can be
grown and converted into methane gas
and methanol alcohol. "They are
things which lend themselves... to
our natural gas and oil pipeline
systems," he said.
Reynolds explained that history
indicates that it takes about 50 years
for a "new energy technology to really
become significant on the energy
scene." He said that the research at the
University will lay the groundwork for
the energy technology of the future.

difficult to transport power from
reactors to homes. He also said that
"estimates of nuclear reserves vary,
but the people who think seriously
about this, I believe, feel that nuclear
energy is something that might carry
us 100 or 200 years at the most."
A much more likely alternative is
solar energy in the form of agricultural
products. Certain high energy yield
crops, such as sugar beets, can be
grown and converted into methane gas
and methanol alcohol. "They are
things which lend themselves... to
our natural gas and oil pipeline
systems," he said.
Reynolds explained that history
indicates that it takes about 50 years
for a "new energy technology to really
become significant on the energy
scene." He said that the research at the
University will lay the groundwork for
the energy technology of the future.

ENERGETIC PROFESSOR — William Reynolds, Chairman of the Mechanical
Engineering Department will head the new Institute for Energy Studies.
Prof. William Reynolds, chairman
of the Mechanical Engineering
Department, yesterday announced the
formation of a new Institute for
Energy Studies to serve as "a central
focus for the energy activities that we
have on campus."
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Reynolds said that the
institute "grew out of a study that we
made here last summer to see what
was going on in the energy area. We
found an awful lot of stuff and
decided to give it some external
visibility and cohesiveness."
The Institute for Energy Studies,
which Reynolds will head, will provide

some support for individual research
by University faculty and will seek
funds from private foundations for
additional research. In addition, the
institute is sponsoring an energy
seminar and co-sponsoring an
engineering class studying, among
other energy alternatives, the
possibility of tapping solar energy
through agricultural production.
Initial funding for the institute
came from the School of Engineering,
which gave the organizers $10,000 last
summer. Since then, the institute has
received grants of $25,000 from the
General Electric Foundation and
$20,000 from a major oil company.
Both grants will be renewed for the
same amounts every year, for the next
five years.
Speaking in general terms about the
energy crisis, Reynolds said that
although the current problem is
serious, "The accumulation of
circumstance has probably made the
problem seem worse than it really is."
He added that research at the
University would not effect the
immediate oil shortage, and that the
institute would deal with the long
term dilemma — the depletion of fossil
energy sources.
Reynolds indicated that the United
States has enough coal to power its

economy for a number of decades, but
when coal reserves are gone, the real
energy crisis will begin.
"We are going to run out of fossil
fuels [oil, coal and natural gas]," he
said. "The only real question is
when ... and what do we do after
that."
Reynolds said that nuclear energy is
not a feasible alternative because it is
difficult to transport power from
reactors to homes. He also said that
"estimates of nuclear reserves vary,
but the people who think seriously
about this, I believe, feel that nuclear
energy is something that might carry
us 100 or 200 years at the most."
