Human Limitations And Infinity
Editor:
As a Christian, I feel I must rise to
Bill Evers' "Challenge to Christian
Religious Belief' as set forth in the
Jan. 9 issue of the Daily.
In his article, Mr. Evers presses for
an "intelligible and non-contradictory
definition" of the Christian's God. We,
as Christians, believe in a God who is
beyond human definition. To attempt
to describe Him would be to place
distinctly human limitations on the
infinite.
When dealing with the term
"infinity," no one every really
understands what exactly it describes.
We know it only as a concept, the full
impact of which is beyond our wildest
human perceptions, yet it is an
accepted and often used term in
mathematics, the sciences, philosophy,
and logic. Why, then should God, who
is referred to as infinite in nearly every
context, be subject to man-imposed
boundaries? If we restrict him in this
way, he becomes no better than
ourselves, and unworthy of our
worship. ,
There can be only one description
of God, that being God's own
description of himself found in
Exodus 3:14, "Ehyeh asher ehyeh,"
translated as I AM WHO I AM or I
WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE or I AM
THAT I AM. As mortals, we cannot
hope or expect to attach a designation
to something beyond our perceptions.
To claim that we could know infinity
would be to raise ourselves to the level
of the infinitely knowledgeable.
The parable of the lilies of the field
as it appeared in the article was quoted
entirely out of context and I feel it
only just that it be restored to its
original text. Christ said to consider
that though the flowers do no work,
they are arrayed in a beauty
unmatched by any of man's
accomplishments.
We should, therefore, not be
concerned with earthly needs, because
God knows they are needed. "But seek
ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you." (Matthew
6:28-34 King James Version) Jesus did
not teach to disregard work or the
future. He simply stated that it should
not be our first concern.
In refuting the possibility of God's
existence, Mr. Evers makes a critical
mistake in his assumption that history
must conform to "known rules of
causality." There is nothing to
discount the possibility of the
existence and equal (perhaps greater)
validity of other presently unknown
rules.
These rules, unknown to man,
would be known to an infinite being
and just as much at his disposal and
command as any of man's "Natural
Laws" which are, after all, only
theories. The miracles which are
incomprehensible to man would be
sensible, perhaps commonplace, to
God.
The atheist demands of the
Christian an exact description and
proof of God's existence. The
Christian does not seek an explanation
or any sort of proof from the atheist;
he seeks only to display God's love
and power as he has come to know it.
If there is no God, why does the
atheist need to disprove His existence;
If God could be rationally and
logically proven to exist, would the
non-believers then believe? I doubt it,
as this would bring Him down to the
level of simply another of man's
proofs, all of which are imperfect and
impermanent. Until it is proven to me
that God cannot possibly exist, I shall
stand firm in my faith and continue to
live my life for Him.

It occurs to me that, this being the
beginning of a new quarter, Stanford
students are again evaluating their
academic and extracurricular
priorities. They are making new
commitments and abandoning old ones,
searching for the most deserving
outlets for their time, energy, and
money.
Importantly, this period of student
decision-making comes at a time when
the United Farm Workers of America
is undergoing a similar, and crucial,
period of evaluation of priorities. The
recent loss of contracts to the
Teamsters has so changed the
bargaining position of the U.F.W. that,
within just the past few weeks, the
union's leaders decided that the long
battle against Safeway must be
postponed in order to utilize most
effectively public support of the Gallo
boycott.
The boycott against Gallo wines is a
battle which can be won in a few
months if traditional Gallo drinkers
(such as college students) choose
instead from the many alternative, and
equally good (actually, better), wines.
(Almaden and Italian Swiss Colony are
among those with U.F.W. contracts.)
Stanford students wishing to educate
themselves about the union or to help
with the boycott effort may attend
the weekly meetings of the Stanford
Farm Worker Support Committee

(every Thursday at 4 p.m. in the
Zapata lounge). In taking stock at the
outset of this new quarter, we must
not neglect to consider the needs of
this very young union, the future of
which may determine the fate of those
who cultivate the food we so casually
swallow.

I have just read the report in the
Daily about your [Dan DeYoung,
Director, Plant Services] energy
buggy, with its statement that
"secretaries like the [reduction in light
bulbs) better."
A large percentage of us secretaries
are well into the middle-aged bracket,
myself included, and I have always
suffered from the low light intensity in
my office. I would object strongly to
the removal of one light tube from
over my desk, in fact I would insist on
any burned out tube being replaced.
However, I do have a suggestion
that might improve the lighting to
such a degree that removal of some
tubes would not beobjectionable.Most
of the fixtures in the engineering
building where I work have opaque
glass diffusers which have been
allowed to get covered with dust over
the years. They are never cleaned. I
suggest that the University institute a
cleaning program, and remove the dust
from all the fixtures, so that the
intensity of light can be maintained at
its highest level. Then, perhaps, fewer
light tubes would provide sufficient
light. Thank you for your
consideration.

Editor:
I would like to state a complaint
that I have had for some time in regard
to the blocking up of traffic which
results when people turning off Alma
Street (Central Expressway) going
towards Stanford University which
becomes University Avenue before
going under the bridge. A number of
people stopping for the sign before
going onto University Avenue before
going under the bridge continue to
stay at the stop sign even when there
are two lanes and another oncoming
car is in the other lane permitting the
stopped car to go.
The stopped car can see far enough
to the left for oncoming cars so that
they could move on if their lane is
free, but some people wait until both
lanes are free before going which
results in traffic being backed up
about two blocks or so at times. It also
prevents people on Alma Street from
going on past the turn off point if they
do not wish to go towards the
University.
Another problem occurs when going
under the bridge towards Stanford on
University Avenue going up the small
hill the line that separates the two
lanes becomes very dim. Some cars will
take both lanes at a short notice which
may result in an accident. If the lines
were more evident, then maybe people
wouldn't do this.

Editor:
The new "Faculty-Staff Directory
74" is selling at the Bookstore for $3,
but I'd like to warn your readers that
they might be better off with the 1973
issue. In my group, the Center for
Radar Astronomy, there are 19 people
listed and 14 are wrong in some way.
(74 percent). My entry takes the cake;
I'm listed as an "Animal Caretaker"
and, while I try to be kind to animals,
that's not my title. An asterisk by my
name indicates (correctly) that I'm
married, if you believe the key on page
4. However, it eventually becomes
clear from context that the asterisk
means "married" only on page 4, but
on pages 11-85 it means "member of
the academic council;" this is never
explained.
A look at our list of 19 entries leads
us to conclude that the many gross
errors in this directory will impede
communications within the University.
Four of our telephone numbers are
missing and a fifth is wrong; Ten room
locations are wrong and another is
missing. Consider a person who tries to
contact our secretary Harriet Smith.
No phone extension is given, and her
location is cited as "Durand/Raley." A
reader experienced with this botched
archive might correctly infer that she
works for Lon Raley (among others)
but, under his name, there is neither a
phone nor a location!
Among the five of our people
whose entries are nominally correct,
two are on leave and yet no clue to
that fact is in the directory. If this is
counted an error, then only three of
nineteen entries are correct (16
percent).
Save your $3 and your '73
Directory. If you expect to need our
group's 1974 numbers, send a note to
Shayne Barrom or Harriet Smith at
Durand 232 and we'll mail you our
corrected list.

It occurs to me that, this being the
beginning of a new quarter, Stanford
students are again evaluating their
academic and extracurricular
priorities. They are making new
commitments and abandoning old ones,
searching for the most deserving
outlets for their time, energy, and
money.
Importantly, this period of student
decision-making comes at a time when
the United Farm Workers of America
is undergoing a similar, and crucial,
period of evaluation of priorities. The
recent loss of contracts to the
Teamsters has so changed the
bargaining position of the U.F.W. that,
within just the past few weeks, the
union's leaders decided that the long
battle against Safeway must be
postponed in order to utilize most
effectively public support of the Gallo
boycott.
The boycott against Gallo wines is a
battle which can be won in a few
months if traditional Gallo drinkers
(such as college students) choose
instead from the many alternative, and
equally good (actually, better), wines.
(Almaden and Italian Swiss Colony are
among those with U.F.W. contracts.)
Stanford students wishing to educate
themselves about the union or to help
with the boycott effort may attend
the weekly meetings of the Stanford
Farm Worker Support Committee

(every Thursday at 4 p.m. in the
Zapata lounge). In taking stock at the
outset of this new quarter, we must
not neglect to consider the needs of
this very young union, the future of
which may determine the fate of those
who cultivate the food we so casually
swallow.

I have just read the report in the

buggy, with its statement that
"secretaries like the [reduction in light
bulbs) better."
A large percentage of us secretaries
are well into the middle-aged bracket,
myself included, and I have always
suffered from the low light intensity in
my office. I would object strongly to
the removal of one light tube from
over my desk, in fact I would insist on
any burned out tube being replaced.
However, I do have a suggestion
that might improve the lighting to
such a degree that removal of some
tubes would not beobjectionable.Most
of the fixtures in the engineering
building where I work have opaque
glass diffusers which have been
allowed to get covered with dust over
the years. They are never cleaned. I
suggest that the University institute a
cleaning program, and remove the dust
from all the fixtures, so that the
intensity of light can be maintained at
its highest level. Then, perhaps, fewer
light tubes would provide sufficient
light. Thank you for your

I would like to state a complaint
that I have had for some time in regard
to the blocking up of traffic which
results when people turning off Alma
Street (Central Expressway) going
towards Stanford University which
becomes University Avenue before
going under the bridge. A number of
people stopping for the sign before
going onto University Avenue before
going under the bridge continue to
stay at the stop sign even when there
are two lanes and another oncoming
car is in the other lane permitting the
stopped car to go.
The stopped car can see far enough
to the left for oncoming cars so that
they could move on if their lane is
free, but some people wait until both
lanes are free before going which
results in traffic being backed up
about two blocks or so at times. It also
prevents people on Alma Street from
going on past the turn off point if they
do not wish to go towards the
University.
Another problem occurs when going
under the bridge towards Stanford on
University Avenue going up the small
hill the line that separates the two
lanes becomes very dim. Some cars will
take both lanes at a short notice which
may result in an accident. If the lines
were more evident, then maybe people
wouldn't do this.

I'm listed as an "Animal Caretaker"
and, while I try to be kind to animals,
that's not my title. An asterisk by my

married, if you believe the key on page
4. However, it eventually becomes
clear from context that the asterisk
means "married" only on page 4, but
on pages 11-85 it means "member of
the academic council;" this is never
explained.
A look at our list of 19 entries leads
us to conclude that the many gross
errors in this directory will impede
communications within the University.
Four of our telephone numbers are
missing and a fifth is wrong; Ten room
locations are wrong and another is
missing. Consider a person who tries to
contact our secretary Harriet Smith.
No phone extension is given, and her
location is cited as "Durand/Raley." A
reader experienced with this botched
archive might correctly infer that she
works for Lon Raley (among others)
but, under his name, there is neither a
phone nor a location!
Among the five of our people
whose entries are nominally correct,
two are on leave and yet no clue to
that fact is in the directory. If this is
counted an error, then only three of
nineteen entries are correct (16
percent).

Human Limitations And Infinity
Editor:
As a Christian, I feel I must rise to
Bill Evers' "Challenge to Christian
Religious Belief' as set forth in the
Jan. 9 issue of the Daily.
In his article, Mr. Evers presses for
an "intelligible and non-contradictory
definition" of the Christian's God. We,
as Christians, believe in a God who is
beyond human definition. To attempt
to describe Him would be to place
distinctly human limitations on the
infinite.
When dealing with the term
"infinity," no one every really
understands what exactly it describes.
We know it only as a concept, the full
impact of which is beyond our wildest
human perceptions, yet it is an
accepted and often used term in
mathematics, the sciences, philosophy,
and logic. Why, then should God, who
is referred to as infinite in nearly every
context, be subject to man-imposed
boundaries? If we restrict him in this
way, he becomes no better than
ourselves, and unworthy of our
worship. ,
There can be only one description
of God, that being God's own
description of himself found in
Exodus 3:14, "Ehyeh asher ehyeh,"
translated as I AM WHO I AM or I
WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE or I AM
THAT I AM. As mortals, we cannot
hope or expect to attach a designation
to something beyond our perceptions.
To claim that we could know infinity
would be to raise ourselves to the level
of the infinitely knowledgeable.
The parable of the lilies of the field
as it appeared in the article was quoted
entirely out of context and I feel it
only just that it be restored to its
original text. Christ said to consider
that though the flowers do no work,
they are arrayed in a beauty
unmatched by any of man's
accomplishments.
We should, therefore, not be
concerned with earthly needs, because
God knows they are needed. "But seek
ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you." (Matthew
6:28-34 King James Version) Jesus did
not teach to disregard work or the
future. He simply stated that it should
not be our first concern.
In refuting the possibility of God's
existence, Mr. Evers makes a critical
mistake in his assumption that history
must conform to "known rules of
causality." There is nothing to
discount the possibility of the
existence and equal (perhaps greater)
validity of other presently unknown
rules.
These rules, unknown to man,
would be known to an infinite being
and just as much at his disposal and
command as any of man's "Natural
Laws" which are, after all, only
theories. The miracles which are
incomprehensible to man would be
sensible, perhaps commonplace, to
God.
The atheist demands of the
Christian an exact description and
proof of God's existence. The
Christian does not seek an explanation
or any sort of proof from the atheist;
he seeks only to display God's love
and power as he has come to know it.
If there is no God, why does the
atheist need to disprove His existence;
If God could be rationally and
logically proven to exist, would the
non-believers then believe? I doubt it,
as this would bring Him down to the
level of simply another of man's
proofs, all of which are imperfect and
impermanent. Until it is proven to me

that I have had for some time in regard
to the blocking up of traffic which
results when people turning off Alma
Street (Central Expressway) going
towards Stanford University which
becomes University Avenue before
going under the bridge. A number of
people stopping for the sign before
going onto University Avenue before
going under the bridge continue to
stay at the stop sign even when there
are two lanes and another oncoming
car is in the other lane permitting the
stopped car to go.
The stopped car can see far enough
to the left for oncoming cars so that
they could move on if their lane is
free, but some people wait until both
lanes are free before going which
results in traffic being backed up
about two blocks or so at times. It also
prevents people on Alma Street from
going on past the turn off point if they
do not wish to go towards the
University.
Another problem occurs when going
under the bridge towards Stanford on
University Avenue going up the small
hill the line that separates the two
lanes becomes very dim. Some cars will
take both lanes at a short notice which
may result in an accident. If the lines
were more evident, then maybe people
wouldn't do this.

I'm listed as an "Animal Caretaker"
and, while I try to be kind to animals,
that's not my title. An asterisk by my

married, if you believe the key on page

clear from context that the asterisk
means "married" only on page 4, but
on pages 11-85 it means "member of
the academic council;" this is never
explained.
A look at our list of 19 entries leads
us to conclude that the many gross
errors in this directory will impede
communications within the University.
Four of our telephone numbers are
missing and a fifth is wrong; Ten room
locations are wrong and another is
missing. Consider a person who tries to
contact our secretary Harriet Smith.
No phone extension is given, and her
location is cited as "Durand/Raley." A
reader experienced with this botched
archive might correctly infer that she
works for Lon Raley (among others)
but, under his name, there is neither a
phone nor a location!
Among the five of our people
whose entries are nominally correct,
two are on leave and yet no clue to
that fact is in the directory. If this is
counted an error, then only three of
nineteen entries are correct (16

Human Limitations And Infinity
Editor:
As a Christian, I feel I must rise to
Bill Evers' "Challenge to Christian
Religious Belief' as set forth in the
Jan. 9 issue of the Daily.
In his article, Mr. Evers presses for
an "intelligible and non-contradictory
definition" of the Christian's God. We,
as Christians, believe in a God who is
beyond human definition. To attempt
to describe Him would be to place
distinctly human limitations on the
infinite.
When dealing with the term
"infinity," no one every really
understands what exactly it describes.
We know it only as a concept, the full
impact of which is beyond our wildest
human perceptions, yet it is an
accepted and often used term in
mathematics, the sciences, philosophy,
and logic. Why, then should God, who
is referred to as infinite in nearly every
context, be subject to man-imposed
boundaries? If we restrict him in this
way, he becomes no better than
ourselves, and unworthy of our
worship. ,
There can be only one description
of God, that being God's own
description of himself found in
Exodus 3:14, "Ehyeh asher ehyeh,"
translated as I AM WHO I AM or I
WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE or I AM
THAT I AM. As mortals, we cannot
hope or expect to attach a designation
to something beyond our perceptions.
To claim that we could know infinity
would be to raise ourselves to the level
of the infinitely knowledgeable.
The parable of the lilies of the field
as it appeared in the article was quoted
entirely out of context and I feel it
only just that it be restored to its
original text. Christ said to consider
that though the flowers do no work,
they are arrayed in a beauty
unmatched by any of man's
accomplishments.
We should, therefore, not be
concerned with earthly needs, because
God knows they are needed. "But seek
ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you." (Matthew
6:28-34 King James Version) Jesus did
not teach to disregard work or the
future. He simply stated that it should
not be our first concern.
In refuting the possibility of God's
existence, Mr. Evers makes a critical
mistake in his assumption that history
must conform to "known rules of
causality." There is nothing to
discount the possibility of the
existence and equal (perhaps greater)
validity of other presently unknown
rules.
These rules, unknown to man,
would be known to an infinite being
and just as much at his disposal and
command as any of man's "Natural
Laws" which are, after all, only
theories. The miracles which are
incomprehensible to man would be
sensible, perhaps commonplace, to
God.
The atheist demands of the
Christian an exact description and
proof of God's existence. The
Christian does not seek an explanation
or any sort of proof from the atheist;
he seeks only to display God's love
and power as he has come to know it.
If there is no God, why does the
atheist need to disprove His existence;
If God could be rationally and
logically proven to exist, would the
non-believers then believe? I doubt it,
as this would bring Him down to the
level of simply another of man's
proofs, all of which are imperfect and
impermanent. Until it is proven to me
that God cannot possibly exist, I shall
stand firm in my faith and continue to
live my life for Him.

It occurs to me that, this being the
beginning of a new quarter, Stanford
students are again evaluating their
academic and extracurricular
priorities. They are making new
commitments and abandoning old ones,
searching for the most deserving
outlets for their time, energy, and
money.
Importantly, this period of student
decision-making comes at a time when
the United Farm Workers of America
is undergoing a similar, and crucial,
period of evaluation of priorities. The
recent loss of contracts to the
Teamsters has so changed the
bargaining position of the U.F.W. that,
within just the past few weeks, the
union's leaders decided that the long
battle against Safeway must be
postponed in order to utilize most
effectively public support of the Gallo
boycott.
The boycott against Gallo wines is a
battle which can be won in a few
months if traditional Gallo drinkers
(such as college students) choose
instead from the many alternative, and
equally good (actually, better), wines.
(Almaden and Italian Swiss Colony are
among those with U.F.W. contracts.)
Stanford students wishing to educate
themselves about the union or to help
with the boycott effort may attend
the weekly meetings of the Stanford
Farm Worker Support Committee

(every Thursday at 4 p.m. in the
Zapata lounge). In taking stock at the
outset of this new quarter, we must
not neglect to consider the needs of
this very young union, the future of
which may determine the fate of those
who cultivate the food we so casually
swallow.

I have just read the report in the

A large percentage of us secretaries
are well into the middle-aged bracket,

suffered from the low light intensity in
my office. I would object strongly to
the removal of one light tube from
over my desk, in fact I would insist on
any burned out tube being replaced.
However, I do have a suggestion
that might improve the lighting to
such a degree that removal of some
tubes would not beobjectionable.Most
of the fixtures in the engineering
building where I work have opaque
glass diffusers which have been
allowed to get covered with dust over
the years. They are never cleaned. I
suggest that the University institute a
cleaning program, and remove the dust
from all the fixtures, so that the
intensity of light can be maintained at

Human Limitations And Infinity
Editor:
As a Christian, I feel I must rise to
Bill Evers' "Challenge to Christian
Religious Belief' as set forth in the
Jan. 9 issue of the Daily.
In his article, Mr. Evers presses for
an "intelligible and non-contradictory
definition" of the Christian's God. We,
as Christians, believe in a God who is
beyond human definition. To attempt
to describe Him would be to place
distinctly human limitations on the
infinite.
When dealing with the term
"infinity," no one every really
understands what exactly it describes.
We know it only as a concept, the full
impact of which is beyond our wildest
human perceptions, yet it is an
accepted and often used term in
mathematics, the sciences, philosophy,
and logic. Why, then should God, who
is referred to as infinite in nearly every
context, be subject to man-imposed
boundaries? If we restrict him in this
way, he becomes no better than
ourselves, and unworthy of our
worship. ,
There can be only one description
of God, that being God's own
description of himself found in
Exodus 3:14, "Ehyeh asher ehyeh,"
translated as I AM WHO I AM or I
WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE or I AM
THAT I AM. As mortals, we cannot
hope or expect to attach a designation
to something beyond our perceptions.
To claim that we could know infinity
would be to raise ourselves to the level
of the infinitely knowledgeable.
The parable of the lilies of the field
as it appeared in the article was quoted
entirely out of context and I feel it
only just that it be restored to its
original text. Christ said to consider
that though the flowers do no work,
they are arrayed in a beauty
unmatched by any of man's
accomplishments.
We should, therefore, not be
concerned with earthly needs, because
God knows they are needed. "But seek
ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you." (Matthew
6:28-34 King James Version) Jesus did
not teach to disregard work or the
future. He simply stated that it should
not be our first concern.
In refuting the possibility of God's
existence, Mr. Evers makes a critical
mistake in his assumption that history
must conform to "known rules of
causality." There is nothing to
discount the possibility of the
existence and equal (perhaps greater)
validity of other presently unknown
rules.
These rules, unknown to man,
would be known to an infinite being
and just as much at his disposal and
command as any of man's "Natural
Laws" which are, after all, only
theories. The miracles which are
incomprehensible to man would be
sensible, perhaps commonplace, to
God.
The atheist demands of the
Christian an exact description and
proof of God's existence. The
Christian does not seek an explanation
or any sort of proof from the atheist;
he seeks only to display God's love
and power as he has come to know it.
If there is no God, why does the
atheist need to disprove His existence;
If God could be rationally and
logically proven to exist, would the
non-believers then believe? I doubt it,
as this would bring Him down to the
level of simply another of man's
proofs, all of which are imperfect and
impermanent. Until it is proven to me
that God cannot possibly exist, I shall
stand firm in my faith and continue to
live my life for Him.

It occurs to me that, this being the
beginning of a new quarter, Stanford
students are again evaluating their
academic and extracurricular
priorities. They are making new
commitments and abandoning old ones,
searching for the most deserving
outlets for their time, energy, and
money.
Importantly, this period of student
decision-making comes at a time when
the United Farm Workers of America
is undergoing a similar, and crucial,
period of evaluation of priorities. The
recent loss of contracts to the
Teamsters has so changed the
bargaining position of the U.F.W. that,
within just the past few weeks, the
union's leaders decided that the long
battle against Safeway must be
postponed in order to utilize most
effectively public support of the Gallo
boycott.
The boycott against Gallo wines is a
battle which can be won in a few
months if traditional Gallo drinkers
(such as college students) choose
instead from the many alternative, and
equally good (actually, better), wines.
(Almaden and Italian Swiss Colony are
among those with U.F.W. contracts.)
Stanford students wishing to educate
themselves about the union or to help
with the boycott effort may attend
the weekly meetings of the Stanford
Farm Worker Support Committee

(every Thursday at 4 p.m. in the
Zapata lounge). In taking stock at the
outset of this new quarter, we must
not neglect to consider the needs of
this very young union, the future of
which may determine the fate of those
who cultivate the food we so casually
swallow.

I have just read the report in the
Daily about your [Dan DeYoung,
Director, Plant Services] energy
buggy, with its statement that
"secretaries like the [reduction in light
bulbs) better."
A large percentage of us secretaries
are well into the middle-aged bracket,
myself included, and I have always
suffered from the low light intensity in
my office. I would object strongly to
the removal of one light tube from
over my desk, in fact I would insist on
any burned out tube being replaced.
However, I do have a suggestion
that might improve the lighting to
such a degree that removal of some
tubes would not beobjectionable.Most
of the fixtures in the engineering
building where I work have opaque
glass diffusers which have been
allowed to get covered with dust over
the years. They are never cleaned. I
suggest that the University institute a
cleaning program, and remove the dust
from all the fixtures, so that the
intensity of light can be maintained at
its highest level. Then, perhaps, fewer
light tubes would provide sufficient
light. Thank you for your
consideration.

I would like to state a complaint
that I have had for some time in regard
to the blocking up of traffic which
results when people turning off Alma
Street (Central Expressway) going
towards Stanford University which
becomes University Avenue before
going under the bridge. A number of
people stopping for the sign before
going onto University Avenue before
going under the bridge continue to
stay at the stop sign even when there
are two lanes and another oncoming
car is in the other lane permitting the
stopped car to go.
The stopped car can see far enough
to the left for oncoming cars so that
they could move on if their lane is
free, but some people wait until both
lanes are free before going which
results in traffic being backed up
about two blocks or so at times. It also
prevents people on Alma Street from
going on past the turn off point if they
do not wish to go towards the
University.
Another problem occurs when going
under the bridge towards Stanford on
University Avenue going up the small
hill the line that separates the two
lanes becomes very dim. Some cars will
take both lanes at a short notice which
may result in an accident. If the lines
were more evident, then maybe people
wouldn't do this.

The new "Faculty-Staff Directory

they might be better off with the 1973
issue. In my group, the Center for
Radar Astronomy, there are 19 people
listed and 14 are wrong in some way.
(74 percent). My entry takes the cake;
I'm listed as an "Animal Caretaker"
and, while I try to be kind to animals,
that's not my title. An asterisk by my
name indicates (correctly) that I'm
married, if you believe the key on page
4. However, it eventually becomes
clear from context that the asterisk
means "married" only on page 4, but
on pages 11-85 it means "member of
the academic council;" this is never
explained.
A look at our list of 19 entries leads
us to conclude that the many gross
errors in this directory will impede
communications within the University.
Four of our telephone numbers are
missing and a fifth is wrong; Ten room
locations are wrong and another is
missing. Consider a person who tries to
contact our secretary Harriet Smith.
No phone extension is given, and her
location is cited as "Durand/Raley." A
reader experienced with this botched
archive might correctly infer that she
works for Lon Raley (among others)
but, under his name, there is neither a
phone nor a location!
Among the five of our people
whose entries are nominally correct,
two are on leave and yet no clue to
that fact is in the directory. If this is
counted an error, then only three of
nineteen entries are correct (16
percent).
Save your $3 and your '73

non-believers then believe? I doubt it,
as this would bring Him down to the
level of simply another of man's
proofs, all of which are imperfect and
impermanent. Until it is proven to me
that God cannot possibly exist, I shall
stand firm in my faith and continue to
live my life for Him.

It occurs to me that, this being the
beginning of a new quarter, Stanford
students are again evaluating their
academic and extracurricular
priorities. They are making new
commitments and abandoning old ones,
searching for the most deserving
outlets for their time, energy, and
money.
Importantly, this period of student
decision-making comes at a time when
the United Farm Workers of America
is undergoing a similar, and crucial,
period of evaluation of priorities. The
recent loss of contracts to the
Teamsters has so changed the
bargaining position of the U.F.W. that,
within just the past few weeks, the
union's leaders decided that the long
battle against Safeway must be
postponed in order to utilize most
effectively public support of the Gallo
boycott.
The boycott against Gallo wines is a
battle which can be won in a few
months if traditional Gallo drinkers
(such as college students) choose
instead from the many alternative, and
equally good (actually, better), wines.
(Almaden and Italian Swiss Colony are
among those with U.F.W. contracts.)
Stanford students wishing to educate
themselves about the union or to help
with the boycott effort may attend
the weekly meetings of the Stanford
Farm Worker Support Committee

(every Thursday at 4 p.m. in the
Zapata lounge). In taking stock at the
outset of this new quarter, we must
not neglect to consider the needs of
this very young union, the future of
which may determine the fate of those
who cultivate the food we so casually
swallow.

I have just read the report in the
Daily about your [Dan DeYoung,
Director, Plant Services] energy
buggy, with its statement that
"secretaries like the [reduction in light
bulbs) better."
A large percentage of us secretaries
are well into the middle-aged bracket,
myself included, and I have always
suffered from the low light intensity in
my office. I would object strongly to
the removal of one light tube from
over my desk, in fact I would insist on
any burned out tube being replaced.
However, I do have a suggestion
that might improve the lighting to
such a degree that removal of some
tubes would not beobjectionable.Most
of the fixtures in the engineering
building where I work have opaque
glass diffusers which have been
allowed to get covered with dust over
the years. They are never cleaned. I
suggest that the University institute a
cleaning program, and remove the dust
from all the fixtures, so that the
intensity of light can be maintained at
its highest level. Then, perhaps, fewer
light tubes would provide sufficient
light. Thank you for your
consideration.

Traffic Bottleneck
Editor:
I would like to state a complaint
that I have had for some time in regard
to the blocking up of traffic which
results when people turning off Alma
Street (Central Expressway) going
towards Stanford University which
becomes University Avenue before
going under the bridge. A number of
people stopping for the sign before
going onto University Avenue before
going under the bridge continue to
stay at the stop sign even when there
are two lanes and another oncoming
car is in the other lane permitting the
stopped car to go.
The stopped car can see far enough
to the left for oncoming cars so that
they could move on if their lane is
free, but some people wait until both
lanes are free before going which
results in traffic being backed up
about two blocks or so at times. It also
prevents people on Alma Street from
going on past the turn off point if they
do not wish to go towards the
University.
Another problem occurs when going
under the bridge towards Stanford on
University Avenue going up the small
hill the line that separates the two
lanes becomes very dim. Some cars will
take both lanes at a short notice which
may result in an accident. If the lines
were more evident, then maybe people
wouldn't do this.

The new "Faculty-Staff Directory
74" is selling at the Bookstore for $3,
but I'd like to warn your readers that
they might be better off with the 1973
issue. In my group, the Center for
Radar Astronomy, there are 19 people
listed and 14 are wrong in some way.
(74 percent). My entry takes the cake;
I'm listed as an "Animal Caretaker"
and, while I try to be kind to animals,
that's not my title. An asterisk by my
name indicates (correctly) that I'm
married, if you believe the key on page
4. However, it eventually becomes
clear from context that the asterisk
means "married" only on page 4, but
on pages 11-85 it means "member of
the academic council;" this is never
explained.
A look at our list of 19 entries leads
us to conclude that the many gross
errors in this directory will impede
communications within the University.
Four of our telephone numbers are
missing and a fifth is wrong; Ten room
locations are wrong and another is
missing. Consider a person who tries to
contact our secretary Harriet Smith.
No phone extension is given, and her
location is cited as "Durand/Raley." A
reader experienced with this botched
archive might correctly infer that she
works for Lon Raley (among others)
but, under his name, there is neither a
phone nor a location!
Among the five of our people
whose entries are nominally correct,
two are on leave and yet no clue to
that fact is in the directory. If this is
counted an error, then only three of
nineteen entries are correct (16
percent).
Save your $3 and your '73
Directory. If you expect to need our
group's 1974 numbers, send a note to
Shayne Barrom or Harriet Smith at
Durand 232 and we'll mail you our
corrected list.

Human Limitations And Infinity
Editor:
As a Christian, I feel I must rise to
Bill Evers' "Challenge to Christian
Religious Belief' as set forth in the
Jan. 9 issue of the Daily.
In his article, Mr. Evers presses for
an "intelligible and non-contradictory
definition" of the Christian's God. We,
as Christians, believe in a God who is
beyond human definition. To attempt
to describe Him would be to place
distinctly human limitations on the
infinite.
When dealing with the term
"infinity," no one every really
understands what exactly it describes.
We know it only as a concept, the full
impact of which is beyond our wildest
human perceptions, yet it is an
accepted and often used term in
mathematics, the sciences, philosophy,
and logic. Why, then should God, who
is referred to as infinite in nearly every
context, be subject to man-imposed
boundaries? If we restrict him in this
way, he becomes no better than
ourselves, and unworthy of our
worship. ,
There can be only one description
of God, that being God's own
description of himself found in
Exodus 3:14, "Ehyeh asher ehyeh,"
translated as I AM WHO I AM or I
WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE or I AM
THAT I AM. As mortals, we cannot
hope or expect to attach a designation
to something beyond our perceptions.
To claim that we could know infinity
would be to raise ourselves to the level
of the infinitely knowledgeable.
The parable of the lilies of the field
as it appeared in the article was quoted
entirely out of context and I feel it
only just that it be restored to its
original text. Christ said to consider
that though the flowers do no work,
they are arrayed in a beauty
unmatched by any of man's
accomplishments.
We should, therefore, not be
concerned with earthly needs, because
God knows they are needed. "But seek
ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you." (Matthew
6:28-34 King James Version) Jesus did
not teach to disregard work or the
future. He simply stated that it should
not be our first concern.
In refuting the possibility of God's
existence, Mr. Evers makes a critical
mistake in his assumption that history
must conform to "known rules of
causality." There is nothing to
discount the possibility of the
existence and equal (perhaps greater)
validity of other presently unknown
rules.
These rules, unknown to man,
would be known to an infinite being
and just as much at his disposal and
command as any of man's "Natural
Laws" which are, after all, only
theories. The miracles which are
incomprehensible to man would be
sensible, perhaps commonplace, to
God.
The atheist demands of the
Christian an exact description and
proof of God's existence. The
Christian does not seek an explanation
or any sort of proof from the atheist;
he seeks only to display God's love
and power as he has come to know it.
If there is no God, why does the
atheist need to disprove His existence;
If God could be rationally and
logically proven to exist, would the
non-believers then believe? I doubt it,
as this would bring Him down to the
level of simply another of man's
proofs, all of which are imperfect and
impermanent. Until it is proven to me
that God cannot possibly exist, I shall
stand firm in my faith and continue to
live my life for Him.
