# Should We Restore ROTC?
## Consensus And Open Minds Sorely Needed 
### 
• Chris L. Murray

The ROTC issue is the first major question the
Stanford Community will have to face for 1974,
and it has already shown considerable potential for
becoming controversial. The old "No" vanguard has
arisen from senescenece ready to lead the way with
dusty signs and obvious senility, paying little
attention to the changed times and the new twist
historical tum of events have given to the question.
Attempts have been made to declare the issue of
little significance and coincidently judicate a
decision that belongs to the community.
As just one student of the Stanford Community,
I think it's only fair that this question should not be
resolved solely by the administration, or the faculty,
or the Academic Council, or a minority of students
operating in a hypo, nor even by the Board of
TVustees or the "student" community alone — but
should come about as the consensus of all, since all
comprise the Stanford Community and as
constituencies have a stake in the outcome.
What are the questions involved with the Reserve
Officer's Training Corps coming back and why was
it ousted in the first place? There is no easy answer
there, but the main reason it had to go dealt with
the clear repugnance of having Stanford participate
in a military program which merely turned men into
machines — trained to kill.
The program was financed, sponsored, and
auspiciously run by our former Department of War
which currently goes under the euphemism of the
Department of Defense. The "teachers" were
Pentagon Specialists who could tell you all about
"gooks" and what to do with them. Specifically
speaking, there were grave ethical questions

involved, some seriously questioning the propriety
of Stanford's role in "going along."
Many Stanford students were caught in the
Pentagon's punitive clause which called for
immediate induction for the student who joined
ROTC but found out later that it was not to his
liking. There were questions of Stanford becoming
"overly beholden" to the Military Establishment
which lavished taxpayer's dollars on this institution
in exchange for "classified" research involving
deadly flesh-searing napalm gas, high powered
explosives, camouflaged booby-traps guaranteed to
wipe out whole platoons (or at least leave all
maimed for life) and also questionable
"psychology" studies relating to "training" — which
incidently brings us back to the ROTC program.
There was the draft which laid heavily on the
student, giving him the "choice" of becoming an
enlisted man or a "trained" officer. And there was
that raving-hell-on-earth which all of us since have
learned to call the Vietnam War.
Things haven't changed that much. And even
though U.S. men are physically participating less in
the present Indochina War — the killing goes on, still
on a massive scale. Taxpayer's dollars still help to
sustain the automated war we started, and no one,
least of all we students, believes that the
Military-Pentagon-Establishment has had a change
of heart or has acquired some sudden inspiration of
benevolence.
No, this talk about establishing a "new and
improved" Pentagon ROTC program at Stanford is a
lot of poppycock but this doesn't mean that

rejection is our only option, or at this stage of the
game even a wise course in the light of the evident
decadence in our "Military Monster" and the
erroding effect it and other factors are having on
our national fibre.
In fact it has occurred that maybe Stanford can
recapture institutional leadership and national
acclaim by initiating a modified ROTC program
with the Stanford faculty, via the various
departments, "teaching" Military History, Military
Strategy Science, Military Attitude Analysis in
Psychology, etc., without the help of the retired
colonels who before served as the Pentagon's
"Specialists." Those men were specialists alright,
but specialists in nothing conducive to the good
Stanford Community, this nation, or the world.
It's essential that all of us keep an open mind as
to other possibilities besides outright rejection. It's
even more essential that the Stanford Community
and all of its constituencies feel out a consensus
collectively. For only in this manner can an
impartial, equitable, and truly beneficial resolution
be reached. No one could ask for more; no one
should settle for less.
Our country is sorely troubled now, and
thoughts about rebuilding it amidst the rabbles
should be utmost in all of our minds. We can rebuild
starting our oppressive military establishment, and
the attitudes and thinking of the men who control
our means of war. Maybe someday the men in the
Pentagon and our nation's capital will realize the
war is the game of fools since "victory" can only be
achieved by one side while "peace" can be achieved
by all.
