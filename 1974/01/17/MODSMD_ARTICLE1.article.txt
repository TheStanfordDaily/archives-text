# Withdrawals Cloud Race For Governor
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY News Analysis 
Recent developments have further
clouded the already-muddy
gubernatorial campaign in both the
Democratic and Republican parties.
First came word two weeks ago that
state Senate Majority Leader George
Moscone, D-San Francisco, was pulling
out of the race; then, yesterday,
sources disclosed that Atty. Gen.
Evelle Younger will seek reelection to
his present post instead of going after
the Republican gubernatorial
nomination.
The Younger disclosure, if true,
could be the more significant, since
polls had placed him at or near the top
of the list of GOP hopefuls. His
departure would leave just two
formally announced candidates, Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke and Controller
Houston Flournoy, in the race.
Both are considered vulnerable —
Reinecke because of his outspoken
conservative views and a recent scandal
in his office uncovered by the Los
Angeles Times, and Flournoy because
he may be too liberal for mainstream
Republicans.
Younger's decision cannot help but
fuel speculation that Gov. Ronald
Reagan will reverse his previous
decision and seek a third term in
Sacramento.
Reagan has been saying for some
time that he won't run again; for a
time he examined the merits of
opposing Democratic Sen. Alan
Cranston before announcing he would
return to private life to prepare for his
widely-expected 1976 Presidential
race.
Changed Situation
But Reagan's decision was made
when Spiro T. Agnew was still
considered the man to beat for the
GOP Presidential nomination; in view
of the national tumult that has placed
Vice President Gerald Ford in the
spotlight, the governor may decide
that he needs the platform and
prestige of elected office to be a
serious contender in two years.
This speculation has been further
fueled by the failure of Republican
money men to come up with a suitable
compromise candidate. Both Health,
Education and Welfare Secretary
Caspar Weinberger and former Deputy
Defense Secretary David Packard
apparently rejected requests to run,
and Reagan may be the only hope of
avoiding a bloody primary battle.
The man in the middle is former
HEW Secretary Robert Finch, also a
former state lieutenant governor.
Finch left a job as White House
counselor with the expressed intention
of running for California office; he has
long been rumored to be after the
governorship, but has been remarkably
quiet for a candidate.
First Casualty
Moscone cited a lack of money and
a lack of enthusiasm among the voters
as his principal reasons for bowing out
of the Democratic race, thus becoming
the first casualty of that campaign. He
denies an oft-repeated rumor that has
him backing San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto for governor this year in
return for Alioto's support for a try at
the mayoralty next year, and has said
he'll now seek reelection to the
Senate.
Moscone's departure narrows the
field to five contenders: Alioto,
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown
.Jr., Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti,
Rep. Jerome Waldie, UC Regent
William Matson Roth, and Claremont
attorney Herb Hafif. Many observers —
including Moscone, when he was in
Palo Alto several months ago — say
that the race will eventually narrow
down to just two serious candidates.
At the moment. Brown and Alioto
continue to be the frontrunners, but
there are still 4'/2 months to primary
day — more than enough time for the
situation to change radically.
