# A 						Reply To Evers
## Christian God Is Not A Cosmic Superman 
### 
Peter Payne

Last week in the Daily there was an
article in which supposedly rational
objections were raised against
Christian belief. Hopefully this may
encourage some to investigate more
fully the claims of Jesus Christ and the
case for Christianity.
Because the article is not before
you, I shall summarize the objections
given and then respond accordingly.
Objections To Belief
The objections raised in the article
can generally be categorized into two
groups. The first asks for a meaningful
definition of God and then goes on to
try to show that the Christian
definition of God is both incoherent
and self-contradictory. The second
raises objections to the arguments and
'proofs' for the existence of God.
The article raises four objections of
the first type. First, 'omnipotence' and
'omniscience' are said to be incoherent
concepts because they imply that God
can do what he can't do, e.g. 'make a
rock bigger than he can move,' and
'invent a puzzle that is more difficult
than he can solve.' Second, human
autonomy is said to be in
contradiction to the idea of God being
Creator, hence all-powerful. Third,
God who is personal and acts in
history is said to be in contradiction to
the assertion that God is unchanging.
Finally, it is said that the existence of
evil is incompatible with there being
an infinitely good God who is also the
all-powerful Creator. (Note:
Omniscience should have been
included in this last objection.)
Those objections of the second
type included objections to the
traditional 'proofs' for the existence of
God, objections to the appeal to direct

mystical revelation, objections to the
appeal to Biblical authority, and lastly
objections to the appeal to miracles.
(Although responses can and have
been given to all these latter
objections, to do so here is impossible
due to limited space. What I shall do is
to outline one rational argument for
belief in the Christian God and
respond to objections applicable to
this line of argument.)
Finally, the article asserted that the
burden of proof for the existence of
God rests on the theist; this being
based on the principle that entities
should not be multiplied except when
required.
Claim of Contradiction
The assertion that Christian belief is
self-contradictory stems from a failure
to understand the nature of the
subject in question, and thereby
statements about God have become
misunderstood.
The demand is made for a
definition of God, and rightly so, but
we must recognize both that any such
definition will have its limitations and
that no comprehensive definition is
possible. God, being the infinite
Creator, cannot be comprehended
within our experience; rather, any
understanding which we may have of
God comes to us only as God relates
to us and as he tells us about himself.
But, even with this, we must realize
that our understanding of God is in
terms of our experience in a finite
world. Our affirmations contain truth
about God, but we must not think
that we can transfer everything which
they imply within our experience to
also be true of God. We must keep in
mind the nature of our subject and the

finitude of ourselves.
A helpful illustration to understand
this point might be the following:
suppose a friend is trying to relate an
experience of his to you, but it
happens that this experience is
completely alien to your own. As your
friend seeks to describe it to you, you
are unable to fully understand. His
statements about the experience are
true statements, but they must not be
taken as more than pointers by which
you are able to catch glimpses of the
nature of his experience. Likewise our
understanding of God and our
assertions about him are necessarily
limited.

This is the first of two parts by
Peter Payne. The second part
will appear tomorrow on this
page.

When we have understood this, it is
fairly easy to see that the so-called
contradictions of the Christian faith
are nothing more than that. First,
'omnipotence' obviously states that all
power is of God, but hardly need this
imply that God can do what is
logically impossible. Nor does this
mean that God cannot limit himself.
Second, consider the supposed
contradiction between God being
Creator and the Biblical assertion of
human responsibility. Granted, we do
not know how to relate these two
assertions, but contradiction arises
only if we assume that these
statements must mean that God
dictates our actions and that we are
autonomous from God. If we are
honest, we must admit that we do not

understand enough either about what
'omnipotence' means for God or about
our status as active agents.
Third, we are told by God that he is
unchanging and that he is outside of
our time framework. It is obvious to
the Christian that God's character does
not change, but are we justified in
saying that God cannot be both
unchanging and yet be active in
history, relating to us personally.
Surely, even science should humble us
to recognize how little we know about
time.
Fourth, we are told that God is
righteous and good, 'in him is no
darkness at all.' Is it not, however, a
bit presumptuous to take this and say
that God is 'infinitely good' and
thereby insist that he must adhere to
all of our human moral standards
(which, by the way, would be
impossible since sometimes different
people's standards conflict).
Obviously God does things which
we neither understand nor like;
nonetheless he has repeatedly
demonstrated his love for us and
demonstrated that he is worthy of our
trust. We ought to recognize that
complete goodness for God does not
mean the same thing as it would mean
for us. We need to acknowledge his
goodness even though we do not
understand how this fits with God's
other assertions about his justice and
judgment.
Let us not forget that the God of
the Bible is not some cosmic
superman; he is the infinite eternal
God, the 'I AM.'
