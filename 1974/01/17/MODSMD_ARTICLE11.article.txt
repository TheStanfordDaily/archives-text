# Terror, Brutality Continue
## Resistance Builds Against Chilean Junta 
### 
Concerned Latin American Scholars

Recent events in Chile point toward the spectre
of increased repression and a rising tide of fascism.
An article just sent from Chile said "The military is
in control of Chile, and there is no doubt that it will
be a long march for the democratic liberation forces
in Chile, no matter which road they choose to
follow. Equally important, however, is that the
resistance is both continuing and emerging in new
forms, despite the shock and terror."
Direct terror and brutality continues unabated.
The junta executed, without any trial, 14
construction workers who led a strike against the
wage freeze in Chile. Twenty Chilean doctors have
been killed or have disappeared since the coup. The
Swedish ambassador Harold Edelstam, was expelled
following his courageous defense of the rights of
refugees. This followed an incident in which he was
severely beaten by the junta's military police while
protecting a Uruguayan woman hospitalized while
under his charge.
The junta continues to imprison members of the
previous government on Dawson Island. Under the
severe prison conditions the lives of many former
government officials are in extreme danger;
Clodomiro Almeyda, the ex-foreign minister is
seriously ill and many not survive; Daniel Vergara,
ex-subsecretary of the Interior Ministry, has had to
have his arm amputated due to gangrene. Since the
coup 47 journalists have been arrested and at least
one executed.
Meanwhile, U.S. banks, the U.S. government and
international lending agencies have been quick to
announce plans to finance the junta. Manufacturer's
Hanover Trust Co. issued a $20 million note to the
Chilean Central Bank and a short term note to the
government. James Greene, Vice President of
Manufacturers, said: "This is a question of
psychological assistance and an expression of good
faith.... In financial circles in my country there is
full confidence in the government." (Le Monde,
Dec. 1) A banking group, including Bankers Trust,

Irving Trust, Citibank and some Canadian banks,
issued a 170 million credit line to the junta. The
Inter-American Development Bank extended a 519.5
million loan to the Chilean Development Corp. after
cutting all loans to the Allende government.
Congress Votes Aid
The 1974 Foreign Aid bill passed by Congress in
December provided $11 million in military grants
and credits to the junta. The Kennedy
ammendment, prohibiting all aid to Chile, was
passed by the Senate, but defeated in the
Senate-House joint conference.
Despite the terrors, the Chilean forces of
democracy are regrouping and planning for the
future. Last month, negotiations between the
Communist Party and the Christian Democrats, who
initially favoured the coup, began toward the
formation of a national front of all democratic
parties. Guerrilla warfare is reported to have begun
in the rural south of Chile and urban resistance has
been increasing. There was a series of comando
actions, the most spectacular of which was an attack
on the Santiago residence of junta member Torribio
Merino. The admiral, howeve,r was not there and
the commandos escaped without losses.
Carlos Altimarano, leader of the Socialist party
and the junta's most wanted man, turned up in
Havana on January 2.
The resistancy in Chile continues to command
world-wide support. British trade unions have
refused to handle any goods either bound for or
coming from Chile. Workers at the Rolls-Royce
factory are refusing to fit or re-equip any engines
for the Chilean air force planes.
Support For Junta Wanes
Venezuela deported a group of "good will"
ambassadors sent by the junta. They were earlier
refused visas by Mexico. The junta is even losing the
middle class support it claimed in Chile. The New
York Times reported "the sudden drop in
purchasing owner and the spectre of hunger (in

Chile) have caused a dramatic shift in attitude
toward the junta. Dozens of the same housewives
and workers who once expressed support for the
junta are now openly critical of the new
government's economic policies."
What does all of this mean to us and what can we
do? The Nixon administration is intent upon
supporting the fascist Chilean junta. They intend to
spend our tax dollars, needed to support our schools
and communities, to finance the purchase of
weapons for the junta. If this upsets uou, write
Cong. Dante Fascell, House Office Bldg. and Sen.
Gale McGee, Senate Office Bldg., Washington, D.C.,
and demand that hearings on U.S. involvement in
Chile begin immediately. Also write Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, Washington D.C. 20520,
urging quick and effective action to begin granting
of asylum to refugees.

Recent events in Chile point toward the spectre
of increased repression and a rising tide of fascism.
An article just sent from Chile said "The military is
in control of Chile, and there is no doubt that it will
be a long march for the democratic liberation forces
in Chile, no matter which road they choose to
follow. Equally important, however, is that the
resistance is both continuing and emerging in new
forms, despite the shock and terror."
Direct terror and brutality continues unabated.
The junta executed, without any trial, 14
construction workers who led a strike against the
wage freeze in Chile. Twenty Chilean doctors have
been killed or have disappeared since the coup. The
Swedish ambassador Harold Edelstam, was expelled
following his courageous defense of the rights of
refugees. This followed an incident in which he was
severely beaten by the junta's military police while
protecting a Uruguayan woman hospitalized while
under his charge.
The junta continues to imprison members of the
previous government on Dawson Island. Under the
severe prison conditions the lives of many former
government officials are in extreme danger;
Clodomiro Almeyda, the ex-foreign minister is
seriously ill and many not survive; Daniel Vergara,
ex-subsecretary of the Interior Ministry, has had to
have his arm amputated due to gangrene. Since the
coup 47 journalists have been arrested and at least
one executed.
Meanwhile, U.S. banks, the U.S. government and
international lending agencies have been quick to
announce plans to finance the junta. Manufacturer's
Hanover Trust Co. issued a $20 million note to the
Chilean Central Bank and a short term note to the
government. James Greene, Vice President of
Manufacturers, said: "This is a question of
psychological assistance and an expression of good
faith.... In financial circles in my country there is
full confidence in the government." (Le Monde,
Dec. 1) A banking group, including Bankers Trust,

Irving Trust, Citibank and some Canadian banks,
issued a 170 million credit line to the junta. The
Inter-American Development Bank extended a 519.5
million loan to the Chilean Development Corp. after
cutting all loans to the Allende government.
Congress Votes Aid
The 1974 Foreign Aid bill passed by Congress in
December provided $11 million in military grants
and credits to the junta. The Kennedy
ammendment, prohibiting all aid to Chile, was
passed by the Senate, but defeated in the
Senate-House joint conference.
Despite the terrors, the Chilean forces of
democracy are regrouping and planning for the
future. Last month, negotiations between the
Communist Party and the Christian Democrats, who
initially favoured the coup, began toward the
formation of a national front of all democratic
parties. Guerrilla warfare is reported to have begun
in the rural south of Chile and urban resistance has
been increasing. There was a series of comando
actions, the most spectacular of which was an attack
on the Santiago residence of junta member Torribio
Merino. The admiral, howeve,r was not there and
the commandos escaped without losses.
Carlos Altimarano, leader of the Socialist party
and the junta's most wanted man, turned up in
Havana on January 2.
The resistancy in Chile continues to command
world-wide support. British trade unions have
refused to handle any goods either bound for or
coming from Chile. Workers at the Rolls-Royce
factory are refusing to fit or re-equip any engines
for the Chilean air force planes.
Support For Junta Wanes
Venezuela deported a group of "good will"
ambassadors sent by the junta. They were earlier
refused visas by Mexico. The junta is even losing the
middle class support it claimed in Chile. The New
York Times reported "the sudden drop in
purchasing owner and the spectre of hunger (in

Chile) have caused a dramatic shift in attitude
toward the junta. Dozens of the same housewives
and workers who once expressed support for the
junta are now openly critical of the new
government's economic policies."

refused to handle any goods either bound for or
coming from Chile. Workers at the Rolls-Royce
factory are refusing to fit or re-equip any engines
for the Chilean air force planes.
Support For Junta Wanes
Venezuela deported a group of "good will"
ambassadors sent by the junta. They were earlier
refused visas by Mexico. The junta is even losing the
middle class support it claimed in Chile. The New
York Times reported "the sudden drop in
purchasing owner and the spectre of hunger (in

Chile) have caused a dramatic shift in attitude
toward the junta. Dozens of the same housewives
and workers who once expressed support for the
junta are now openly critical of the new
government's economic policies."
What does all of this mean to us and what can we
do? The Nixon administration is intent upon
supporting the fascist Chilean junta. They intend to
spend our tax dollars, needed to support our schools
and communities, to finance the purchase of
weapons for the junta. If this upsets uou, write
Cong. Dante Fascell, House Office Bldg. and Sen.
Gale McGee, Senate Office Bldg., Washington, D.C.,
and demand that hearings on U.S. involvement in
Chile begin immediately. Also write Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, Washington D.C. 20520,
urging quick and effective action to begin granting
of asylum to refugees.

Recent events in Chile point toward the spectre
of increased repression and a rising tide of fascism.
An article just sent from Chile said "The military is
in control of Chile, and there is no doubt that it will
be a long march for the democratic liberation forces
in Chile, no matter which road they choose to
follow. Equally important, however, is that the
resistance is both continuing and emerging in new
forms, despite the shock and terror."
Direct terror and brutality continues unabated.
The junta executed, without any trial, 14
construction workers who led a strike against the
wage freeze in Chile. Twenty Chilean doctors have
been killed or have disappeared since the coup. The
Swedish ambassador Harold Edelstam, was expelled
following his courageous defense of the rights of
refugees. This followed an incident in which he was
severely beaten by the junta's military police while
protecting a Uruguayan woman hospitalized while
under his charge.
The junta continues to imprison members of the
previous government on Dawson Island. Under the
severe prison conditions the lives of many former
government officials are in extreme danger;
Clodomiro Almeyda, the ex-foreign minister is
seriously ill and many not survive; Daniel Vergara,
ex-subsecretary of the Interior Ministry, has had to
have his arm amputated due to gangrene. Since the
coup 47 journalists have been arrested and at least
one executed.
Meanwhile, U.S. banks, the U.S. government and
international lending agencies have been quick to
announce plans to finance the junta. Manufacturer's
Hanover Trust Co. issued a $20 million note to the
Chilean Central Bank and a short term note to the
government. James Greene, Vice President of
Manufacturers, said: "This is a question of
psychological assistance and an expression of good
faith.... In financial circles in my country there is
full confidence in the government." (Le Monde,
Dec. 1) A banking group, including Bankers Trust,

Irving Trust, Citibank and some Canadian banks,
issued a 170 million credit line to the junta. The
Inter-American Development Bank extended a 519.5
million loan to the Chilean Development Corp. after
cutting all loans to the Allende government.
Congress Votes Aid
The 1974 Foreign Aid bill passed by Congress in
December provided $11 million in military grants
and credits to the junta. The Kennedy
ammendment, prohibiting all aid to Chile, was
passed by the Senate, but defeated in the
Senate-House joint conference.
Despite the terrors, the Chilean forces of
democracy are regrouping and planning for the
future. Last month, negotiations between the
Communist Party and the Christian Democrats, who
initially favoured the coup, began toward the
formation of a national front of all democratic
parties. Guerrilla warfare is reported to have begun
in the rural south of Chile and urban resistance has
been increasing. There was a series of comando
actions, the most spectacular of which was an attack
on the Santiago residence of junta member Torribio
Merino. The admiral, howeve,r was not there and
the commandos escaped without losses.
Carlos Altimarano, leader of the Socialist party
and the junta's most wanted man, turned up in
Havana on January 2.
The resistancy in Chile continues to command
world-wide support. British trade unions have
refused to handle any goods either bound for or
coming from Chile. Workers at the Rolls-Royce

for the Chilean air force planes.
