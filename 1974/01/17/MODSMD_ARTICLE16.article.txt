# Mentalist Kreskin Still Amazes
## 
### WAYNE MILLER 
"The Amazing Kreskin." Is he
all that amazing?
Approximately 1300 curious
people showed up at San
Francisco's Masonic Auditorium
last Friday evening to find out.
When they left two hours later,
there were very few who were not
converted into believers. For the
20 subjects who succombed
to the "power of suggestion," to
the four people who hid Kreskin's
check to the non-participating
audience, it was truly, in words of
S.F. Psychic Society member
John Campbell, "a show you'll
never forget."
"Mr. E.S.P." came out dressed
in a smart outfit and immediately
began loosening the audience.
Resembling Don Rickles, he called
the crowd "flaky" and "a bit slow
tonight." Ten minutes later, with
the audience very loose and a bit
impatient, Kreskin unleashed his
first demonstration: he asked for
three men's rings, placed them on
a pencil, and with a little
hocus-pocus, they interlocked. He
pulled the rings apart without
harming any of the jewelry.
Next, he picked up a deck of
cards, chose two volunteers, and
let each of them take a pile of
cards from the deck. He then
proceeded to name off each card
held by both participants in order
through what he called "mental
pictures." He only faltered once,
but otherwise he named each card
perfectly.
Complete Participation
Kreskin followed the card
antics with a plea for complete
audience participation — he asked
everyone to close their eyes and
"receive the impression" that he
was sending telepathically. About
50 percent "saw" a triangle inside
a circle; similarly, a good majority
perceived "37" in their mind's eye
when he told the crowd that he
was thinking of a number between
zero and 99.
Although he claims that he
does not "mind read," the
mentalist did just that for the
next half-hour. After the entire

audience had written down
personal information and sealed
the slips of paper in envelopes
provided by Kreskin (who
complained that he was "pinched
twice — both times by the same
man"), he began reciting
"impressions." For example, he
began spelling "C ... H ... E ...
N" which was the name of a
man's Spanish wife. In all but one
case, his thoughts applied to

people in the audience and were
correct.
The second part of the show
was a demonstration of the
"power of suggestion," Kreskin's
answer to hypnosis without a
swinging watch. In his now
familiar rambling style, Mr. E.SP.
explained that instead of placing
his subjects into a trance, he can
make people respond — i.e. act
crazy — to suggestion.

He then proceeded to prove his
theory that hypnosis "simply does
not exist" with 20 very willing
subjects. Without putting any to
sleep, Kreskin "helped" subjects
to forget their names, experience
extreme heat and cold, be unable
to throw a cigarette on the floor,
and feel pain originating from
nowhere.
Despite his critics, Kreskin

continues to perform before
audiences and, as well, tapes a TV
show each week. He invites
skeptics by offering $20,000 to
anyone who can "prove that I use
counterfeiters in the audience or
have unseen assistants." Watching
him perform is proof enough for
most. But if you're still
unconvinced, ask him to play a
card game with you. He'll be
happy to oblige!

He then proceeded to prove his
theory that hypnosis "simply does
not exist" with 20 very willing
subjects. Without putting any to
sleep, Kreskin "helped" subjects
to forget their names, experience
extreme heat and cold, be unable
to throw a cigarette on the floor,
and feel pain originating from
nowhere.
Despite his critics, Kreskin

continues to perform before
audiences and, as well, tapes a TV
show each week. He invites
skeptics by offering $20,000 to
anyone who can "prove that I use
counterfeiters in the audience or
have unseen assistants." Watching
him perform is proof enough for
most. But if you're still
unconvinced, ask him to play a
card game with you. He'll be
happy to oblige!
"The Amazing Kreskin." Is he
all that amazing?
Approximately 1300 curious
people showed up at San
Francisco's Masonic Auditorium
last Friday evening to find out.
When they left two hours later,
there were very few who were not
converted into believers. For the
20 subjects who succombed
to the "power of suggestion," to
the four people who hid Kreskin's
check to the non-participating
audience, it was truly, in words of
S.F. Psychic Society member
John Campbell, "a show you'll
never forget."
"Mr. E.S.P." came out dressed
in a smart outfit and immediately
began loosening the audience.
Resembling Don Rickles, he called
the crowd "flaky" and "a bit slow
tonight." Ten minutes later, with
the audience very loose and a bit
impatient, Kreskin unleashed his
first demonstration: he asked for
three men's rings, placed them on
a pencil, and with a little
hocus-pocus, they interlocked. He
pulled the rings apart without
harming any of the jewelry.
Next, he picked up a deck of
cards, chose two volunteers, and
let each of them take a pile of
cards from the deck. He then
proceeded to name off each card
held by both participants in order
through what he called "mental
pictures." He only faltered once,
but otherwise he named each card
perfectly.
Complete Participation
Kreskin followed the card
antics with a plea for complete
audience participation — he asked
everyone to close their eyes and
"receive the impression" that he
was sending telepathically. About
50 percent "saw" a triangle inside
a circle; similarly, a good majority
perceived "37" in their mind's eye
when he told the crowd that he
was thinking of a number between
zero and 99.
Although he claims that he
does not "mind read," the
mentalist did just that for the
next half-hour. After the entire

audience had written down
personal information and sealed
the slips of paper in envelopes
provided by Kreskin (who
complained that he was "pinched
twice — both times by the same
man"), he began reciting
"impressions." For example, he
began spelling "C ... H ... E ...
N" which was the name of a
man's Spanish wife. In all but one
case, his thoughts applied to

people in the audience and were
correct.
The second part of the show
was a demonstration of the
"power of suggestion," Kreskin's
answer to hypnosis without a
swinging watch. In his now
familiar rambling style, Mr. E.SP.
explained that instead of placing
his subjects into a trance, he can
make people respond — i.e. act
crazy — to suggestion.
