# David Steinberg Succeeds Despite Wasserman's Words
## 
### RONALD BECK 
David Steinberg put on an
excellent show for capacity
crowds last week at the Boarding
House. His humor ranged from
political satire, a la Mort Sahl, to
pure comical monologues.
Although Steinberg's style of
joke telling is a little unorthodox
(in the fact that not only does he
laugh at all of his jokes, but that
he starts to laugh before he even
begins the joke), in an intimate
club like the Boarding House, his
manner seems to bring him closer
to the audience. Steinberg's
material is good enough to let him
deliver it in any style he cares to.
His monologue started with a
large amount of Watergate
material. One of his finer lines was
describing John Connally as "one
of those rare instances of a rat
swimming towards a sinking
ship."
Steinberg has a real dislike for
critics and lets it be known. He
recalled his last San Francisco
appearance during which he was
panned mercilessly by local
reporters. He described his feeling
for the press. "I don't think too
much of critics. I regard critics as
the eunuchs at a gang bang. They
watch it all, they record it all, but
they can't really do it
themselves."

The Chronicle's reporter got
the better of Steinberg though.
The next morning John
Wasserman blasted Steinberg's
show, continuing a pointless
verbal war.
Steinberg spent a lot of his
performance joking about ethnic
groups, which might just well be
the backbone behind any
comedian today.
He ran through a number of
Jewish, Puerto Rican, and black
jokes. He said that he feels
qualified to take about

generalizations. "Some Jews are
good with money, some blacks
have rhythm, and some Orientals
all look alike ..
Rather than making up
ridiculous situations to get laughs,
Steinberg analyzes real life, like
the daily news, and points out the
humor in it."I heard that Nixon
announced that Operation Candor
is over. To believe that, you first
have to assume that it
started . .. which is impossible."
Recounting a story about a
past moment of fear, he said that

he was "trembling like David
Eisenhower at an orgy." He
managed to put in another jab at
reporters before continuing on.
Steinberg picked up a guitar
and sang and played all of Shel
Silverstein's "Freakin' at the
Freaker's Ball." The change of
pace was perfectly timed, and
kept the interest high during his
hour long monologue.

humor in it."I heard that Nixon
announced that Operation Candor
is over. To believe that, you first
have to assume that it
started . .. which is impossible."
Recounting a story about a
past moment of fear, he said that

he was "trembling like David
Eisenhower at an orgy." He
managed to put in another jab at
reporters before continuing on.
Steinberg picked up a guitar
and sang and played all of Shel
Silverstein's "Freakin' at the
Freaker's Ball." The change of
pace was perfectly timed, and
kept the interest high during his
hour long monologue.
David Steinberg put on an
excellent show for capacity
crowds last week at the Boarding
House. His humor ranged from
political satire, a la Mort Sahl, to
pure comical monologues.
Although Steinberg's style of
joke telling is a little unorthodox
(in the fact that not only does he
laugh at all of his jokes, but that
he starts to laugh before he even
begins the joke), in an intimate
club like the Boarding House, his
manner seems to bring him closer
to the audience. Steinberg's
material is good enough to let him
deliver it in any style he cares to.
His monologue started with a
large amount of Watergate
material. One of his finer lines was
describing John Connally as "one
of those rare instances of a rat
swimming towards a sinking
ship."
Steinberg has a real dislike for
critics and lets it be known. He
recalled his last San Francisco
appearance during which he was
panned mercilessly by local
reporters. He described his feeling
for the press. "I don't think too
much of critics. I regard critics as
the eunuchs at a gang bang. They
watch it all, they record it all, but
they can't really do it
themselves."

The Chronicle's reporter got
the better of Steinberg though.
The next morning John
Wasserman blasted Steinberg's
show, continuing a pointless
verbal war.
Steinberg spent a lot of his
performance joking about ethnic
groups, which might just well be
the backbone behind any
comedian today.
He ran through a number of
Jewish, Puerto Rican, and black
jokes. He said that he feels
qualified to take about

generalizations. "Some Jews are
good with money, some blacks
have rhythm, and some Orientals
all look alike ..
Rather than making up
ridiculous situations to get laughs,
Steinberg analyzes real life, like
the daily news, and points out the
humor in it."I heard that Nixon
announced that Operation Candor
is over. To believe that, you first
have to assume that it
started . .. which is impossible."
