'Warships In South China Sea'
SAIGON — The South Vietnamese military command accused
China today of sending two warships into the area of the disputed
Paracels Islands in the South China Sea, and"the Vietnamese
navy is keeping track of them."
Lt. Col. Le Trung Hien, chief spokesman for the South
Vietnamese military command, said the Chinese ships moved into
the area early yesterday.
Hien said no incidents had been reported and added that he
could not state whether South Vietnam was planning any
retaliatory action.
"I am not qualified to answer that," he said. He said the
warships "are still cruising in that area."
South Vietnam and China both claim possession of the
archipelagoes about 250 miles east of the South Vietnamese city
of Hue and 175 miles southeast of the Chinese island of Hainan.
The Paracels are a group of uninhabited coral reefs and islands
with little more than strategic value.
Kissinger Flies Mideast Shuttle
ASWAN, Egypt — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger flew
the diplomatic shuttle back and forth between Egypt and Israel
yesterday, confident that the two sides were nearing agreement
on disengagement.
Kissinger arrived at Aswan from Jerusalem yesterday morning,
and huddled twice with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat before
flying back to Israel late last night.

Kissinger went to the airport from an evening meeting with
Sadat, escorted by Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy.
Both Fahmy and the United States ambassador to Egypt,
Hermann Eilts, said Kissinger would return to Aswan this week.
Kissinger, reflecting the optimism he has expressed since
arriving in the Mideast, said in Aswan that "the gap is narrowing."
"I am coming here with the hope of narrowing it further, or
even eliminating it,"he added.
It was Kissinger's third trip to Aswan on his current Mideast
mediation mission. Talks there with President Anwar Sadat
followed his second stop in Israel for meetings with Foreign
Minister Abba Eban and other Israeli leaders.
50-50 Chanee Of Gas Rationing
WASHINGTON — The nation faces a 50-50 chance of gasoline
rationing but a final decision is unlikely before this summer, a top
federal energy official said yesterday.
John Sawhill, deputy director of the Federal Energy Office,
said the Nixon administration will face more pressure in the
summer to ration gasoline as use of the fuel rises sharply during
vacation time.
Although the government will be ready to put the plan into
effect within 60 days, if necessary, "it might be more likely that
the plan would go into effect in summer as peak gasoline
demands go up," he said.
Sawhill said at a news conference that the standby rationing
plan unveiled by the energy office Tuesday would require as
many as 17,000 people and cost as much as $1 billion to operate.
He urged the American people to send their comments to the
energy office on the rationing proposal, under which coupons
would be issued to all licensed drivers over 18.
Under the proposed system, if the gasoline shortage remains at
its current 20 percent level, drivers could expect to get ration
coupons to buy from 33 to 41 gallons a month, depending on
where they live.
Getty Kidnappers Arrested
ROME — Police arrested three men yesterday on charges of
kidnapping J. Paul Getty 111 and said a gang known as the
mainland Mafia was involved in the crime.
The police said they were looking for a fourth man on charges
of kidnapping Getty, released last Dec. 15 after five months'
captivity.
The police also recovered a cache of money believed to be part
of the $2.7-million ransom paid for the release of the 17-year-old
grandson of American billionaire J. Paul Getty, a source said. The
police would not confirm the report.
The police said they had acted against the Calabrian
underworld, known in Italy as ihe mainland Mafia and said to be
as vicious as the Mafia organization in Sicily.
The arrested men were charged with kidnapping, criminal

association and causing a person serious injury. The last charge
was believed to be a result of the kidnappers having cut off one of
Getty's ears and mailing it to a Rome newspaper to show that the
abduction was not a hoax.
'Houston Death Price: $200'
HOUSTON — A police detective testified yesterday in the
Houston mass murders pretrial hearings that a suburban Pasadena
man bought teen-age boys for $200 then ended their lives in
gruesome homosexual torture.
David Mullican spoke in calm, unemotional tones as the state
prepared to try Elmer Wayne Henley, 17, in the death of Charles
R. Cobble, 17.
Henley is charged with five other killings in the mass slayings
case in which 27 young men died over a three-year period.
Henley was arrested Aug. 8 at the home of Dean A. Corll, 33,
whose bullet-ripped body was found following what Henley said
was a sex and paint-sniffing party.
Mullican, a Pasadena police detective who led the
investigation, said Henley gave oral and written statements
admitting he had shot Corll during the orgy.
He said Henley told him that Corll had once confided that he
belonged to a "homosexual ring which bought and sold boys."
Prosecutor Lacks Law Degree
MIAMI, Fla. — Frank Joyce came a long way in his one-year
career as a prosecutor with the Dade County State Attorney's
office.
He rose to supervisor in the misdemeanor courts in seven
months, was promoted to a job trying felony cases, and won the
praise of a judge who says he gives praise stingily.
Yesterday, Frank Joyce was out of a job after officials
discovered he did not have a law degree. They said the Chicago
law school he claimed had given him a degree reports he dropped
out the day he enrolled.
No charges have been filed against Joyce.
