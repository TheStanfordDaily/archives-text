# FBI Undertakes Probe Of Nixon Tape Erasures
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Federal Bureau of Investigation said
last night it will investigate the erasure
of an 18.5-minute segment from a tape
recording of a White House
conversation.
An FBI spokesman said the
investigation was being undertaken at
the request of special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
Earlier, Stephen B. Bull, a special
assistant to the President, told a
federal court hearing that the only
people he knew of who had access to
that tape were himself; the President;
his secretary, Rose Mary Woods; J.
Fred Buzhardt, a White House lawyer;
Gen. John Bennett, an aide.
On Tuesday a panel of technical
experts said there were at least five
and perhaps as many as nine instances
of erasing and re-recording in the
18.5-minute obliterated segment.
Questions Access
Most of the questions directed to
Bull and a Secret Service official who
preceded him on the stand dealt with
who had access to the tape and the
Uher 5000 recording machine the
experts pinpointed as the one used
when the conversation was obliterated.
Bull startled the spectators in the
courtroom, when, upon being shown a
receipt indicating he had received the
Uher recorder last Oct. 1, he said,
"That is not my signature ... that is
not even close."
Bull did acknowledge that he had
received the machine that day and had
passed it on to Woods to use while

trying to transcribe the June 20 tape.
Bull said he had listened to the
tapes to determine where the
subpoenaed conversations began on
each reel and had marked them so that
Woods would know where to begin
transcribing.
He said he had never listened to the
Haldeman portion of the June 20 tape
and never heard the buzz later found
on the recording.
Louis Sims, chief of the technical
service division of the Secret Service,
testified that he was unable to supply
documentary evidence on who had
used the tape recorders at various
times. He said those records were
destroyed each time a machine was
returned to Secret Service custody.
According to Haldeman's notes, the
obliterated segment contained the
only discussion, at that meeting, of the
Watergate break-in which had occurred
three days before.
Judgments Premature
The White House said "premature
judgments" about the cause of the gap
"are altogether unwarranted."
"Further discussion would be
improper while this matter is in
court," said a formal statement from
the office of White House counsel J.
Fred Buzhardt.
When Deputy Press Secretary
Gerald L. Warren was asked by a
reporter "Did the President erase the
tape?" he said: "The answer to your
question is no."
In a related development, U.S.

District Judge John J. Sirica raised the
possibility yesterday that the case of
the White House tape gap may be
referred to a grand jury.
"I have to decide whether or not
I'm going to recommend to the special
prosecutor that this case should be
submitted or whether the special
prosecutor should seriously consider
submitting it to the grand jury," Sirica
said.
Sirica made his comment in a
judicial argument with Charles Rhyne,
the lawyer for President Nixon's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods. Woods
earlier had said that she had pushed
the record-erase button on a tape
recorder while transcribing the June
20 conversation.

submitting it to the grand jury," Sirica
said.
Sirica made his comment in a
judicial argument with Charles Rhyne,
the lawyer for President Nixon's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods. Woods
earlier had said that she had pushed
the record-erase button on a tape
recorder while transcribing the June
20 conversation.

AT EASE — Former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson visited the campus
yesterday to answer questions in an informal session with members of the news
media. Richardson centered his comments around the newest Presidential
dilemma created by recent reports of tape tampering.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Federal Bureau of Investigation said
last night it will investigate the erasure
of an 18.5-minute segment from a tape
recording of a White House
conversation.
An FBI spokesman said the
investigation was being undertaken at
the request of special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
Earlier, Stephen B. Bull, a special
assistant to the President, told a
federal court hearing that the only
people he knew of who had access to
that tape were himself; the President;
his secretary, Rose Mary Woods; J.
Fred Buzhardt, a White House lawyer;
Gen. John Bennett, an aide.
On Tuesday a panel of technical
experts said there were at least five
and perhaps as many as nine instances
of erasing and re-recording in the
18.5-minute obliterated segment.
Questions Access
Most of the questions directed to
Bull and a Secret Service official who
preceded him on the stand dealt with
who had access to the tape and the
Uher 5000 recording machine the
experts pinpointed as the one used
when the conversation was obliterated.
Bull startled the spectators in the
courtroom, when, upon being shown a
receipt indicating he had received the
Uher recorder last Oct. 1, he said,
"That is not my signature ... that is
not even close."
Bull did acknowledge that he had
received the machine that day and had
passed it on to Woods to use while

trying to transcribe the June 20 tape.
Bull said he had listened to the
tapes to determine where the
subpoenaed conversations began on
each reel and had marked them so that
Woods would know where to begin
transcribing.
He said he had never listened to the
Haldeman portion of the June 20 tape
and never heard the buzz later found
on the recording.
Louis Sims, chief of the technical
service division of the Secret Service,
testified that he was unable to supply
documentary evidence on who had
used the tape recorders at various
times. He said those records were
destroyed each time a machine was
returned to Secret Service custody.
According to Haldeman's notes, the
obliterated segment contained the
only discussion, at that meeting, of the
Watergate break-in which had occurred
three days before.
Judgments Premature
The White House said "premature
judgments" about the cause of the gap
"are altogether unwarranted."
"Further discussion would be
improper while this matter is in
court," said a formal statement from
the office of White House counsel J.
Fred Buzhardt.
When Deputy Press Secretary
Gerald L. Warren was asked by a
reporter "Did the President erase the
tape?" he said: "The answer to your
question is no."
In a related development, U.S.

District Judge John J. Sirica raised the
possibility yesterday that the case of
the White House tape gap may be
referred to a grand jury.
"I have to decide whether or not
I'm going to recommend to the special
prosecutor that this case should be
submitted or whether the special
prosecutor should seriously consider
submitting it to the grand jury," Sirica
said.
Sirica made his comment in a
judicial argument with Charles Rhyne,
the lawyer for President Nixon's
secretary, Rose Mary Woods. Woods
