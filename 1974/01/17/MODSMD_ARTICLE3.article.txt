# McCloskey Alleges Erasures Deliberate
## 
### MIKE PHILLIPS 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, believes the erasures discovered in a
key White House tape were deliberate and that whoever tampered with them
should be prosecuted.
Only minutes after taking his first question in an informal question and
answer session at Tresidder Union yesterday, McCloskey said, "It might have
been Steven Bull, H.R. Haldeman, Rosemary Woods or President Nixon.
Somebody erased those tapes."
In the give and take session which lasted nearly two hours, McCloskey went
on to discuss a "strong" move in the House of Representatives to impeach
Nixon. He also talked about the

energy crisis, saying it was partially a
result of "non-action" on the part of
the White House, which has been slow
to react after accepting campaign
contributions from oil companies.
In the move to impeach Nixon, the
House has appropriated $1 million
McCloskey said. He mentioned that
representatives will take up the task of
defining Nixon's impeachable offenses
next week.
According to McCloskey, Nixon has
committed four or possibly five
felonies and can be impeached for
"high crimes and misdemeanors."
"If we don't impeach on these
facts," said McCloskey "we can't help
setting a precedent for expanding the
president's power in the future."
Mixed Constituency
When asked what his constituents
felt about impeachment, McCloskey
estimated that 30 percent approved,
20 percent disapproved and 50 percent
believed Nixon was guilty but wasn't
sure that he should be removed.
When asked if Nixon should be
brought to trial even if he were to
resign, McCloskey replied that criminal
charges should be dismissed in order to
carry on quickly with the more
important task of running the
government. He asked the audience of
150 what they thought about
dismissing charges against Nixon, and
they responded with a resounding
no.
Several times McCloskey referred to
former Attorney General Elliot
Richardson as his "number-one hero,"
lauding Richardson's act of resigning
rather than firing Watergate Prosecutor
Archibalt Cox. "Richardson was the
first man to resign rather than carry
out those hideous requests,"
McCloskey said.
He also praised Vice-President
Gerald Ford, calling him "a very
decent man."
Years Ahead
In discussing the energy crisis,
McCloskey said it will be at least ten
years and possibly longer before the
U.S. is self-sufficient in energy
resources.
He also said that professors and
scientists in and around Stanford
could make decisions about energy
policy as well as any committee in
Congress.
McCloskey was asked about Federal
Energy chief William Simon and
praised Simon because "he cuts
through red tape and doesn't do what
the oil companies dictate."
