## Pocket Calculators Aid Students 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Faster than a slide rule, more
powerful than the human mind, able
to scale complex equations in a single
bound. A pre-med red hot? — no, it's a
pocket calculator.
This computer-like mechanism,
disguised by its snug leather case,
performs mathematical marvels.
Squares, square roots, sines, cosines
and tangents are computed easily with
this mild-mannered brain substitute.
Like Clark Kent, the calculator is
unassuming when "not in action." It
rests comfortably on the corner of the
desk, ready to spring into action at the
touch of a button.
Solving endless computations, the
calculator aids the businessman, the
engineer and the citizen figuring his
income tax return. The calculator is
also welcome here in academic
departments, like engineering.

Engineering Prof. Thomas Kane
freely permits the use of calculators.
"We [engineering professors] should
not stand in the way of progress,"
Kane said. "Our students should be
encouraged to use calculators. It's like
the automobile replacing the horse and
buggy."
Kane conceded that the use of
calculators necessarily raises the issue
of fairness — whether some students
should have more "superior tools"
than others. "I try to structure the
numerical work in tests and
examinations so that calculators
become minimally important," he
said.
Those who oppose the use of
calculators by students during tests
insist the cost is prohibitively large, so
only the affluent can afford to foot
the bill.

At UC-Berkeley, there is talk of
banning them during all examinations.
Here, the decision is left up to the
individual professor.
Sophomore Mark Shaw, an
engineering student, said, "I think
calculators are a gross disadvantage to
those who don't own them. They're
simply not fair." Shaw does not own a
calculator.
Most students say that calculators
do little more than reassure them that
answers are correct. Freshman George
Lenes, enrolled in Kane's fall quarter
engineering course, said, "I felt secure
that my computations were correct
while I used my calculator during the
final exam. In engineering, though, the
method of arriving at an answer is
more important than the answer
itself."
In the mathematics department,
where computing machines and slide
rules are rarely used, no policy exists
on calculators, according to the vice
chairman, Prof. Paul Berg.
Berg pointed out that calculators
are useful only in the Calculus 40
series, designed primarily for
mathematics and engineering students.
"In other math courses, the use of
calculators is an irrelevant issue"
because mathematical concepts —
rahter than solutions — are stressed,
Berg said.
Mathematics Emeritus Prof. Harold
Bacon, an instructor of the Calculus
40 series, refuses "out of fairness for
those who don't have them" to allow
calculators during exams, he said.
Engineering students find
calculators as indispensible as math
students Find them unnecessary'. Asst.
Engineering Dean Alfred Kirkland
recommends them to all prospective
students. "In some cases, the use of
calculators dscriminates against those
who can't afford them, but they are
easily available in many of our
departments for anyone to use,"
Kirkland said.
At last year's commencement
ceremonies of the School of
Engineering, both the outstanding
faculty member and graduating senior
were awarded a scroll — and a
Hewlett-Packard 45 Advanced
Scientific Calculator.

POCKET WIZARD — This student joins the mathematical and engineering ranks
of those with pocket calculators. The use of these instruments in math and
science classes has sparked "fairness" controversy.
