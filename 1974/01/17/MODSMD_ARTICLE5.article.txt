# Richardson's Message
## Nixon Urged To Cooperate 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Former Nixon Cabinet member
Elliot L. Richardson yesterday urged
the President to pursue a policy of
"full cooperation with the
investigative process and full
disclosure" of all evidence related to
the Watergate case. "There has to be
the assurance that all the factors are
available," he said.
Richardson made his remarks while
answering questions from a small
group of professional journalism
fellows and members of the news
media in the Law School yesterday
afternoon. His appearance followed by
one day the release of expert reports
that the 18 minute gap in one of the
Watergate tapes was caused by
repeated erasures.
"I still believe that the judgment
should be withheld until the evidence
is in," Richardson said in regard to
possible impeachment of the
President.
Richardson recommended that
Nixon "subject himself to sustained
interrogation by people deeply
immersed in the evidence," such as
members of the Special Prosecutor's
office, the Senate Watergate
Committee or the House Judiciary

Committee which is investigating
grounds for impeachment.
He said such an interrogation
should not be televised, but that a
public transcript should be published.
Cooperation Needed
In addition, Richardson said,
"There ought to be some
understanding between the Special
Prosecutor and the Rodino Committee
[the House Judiciary Committee]"
that the Special Prosecutor make
available to the Judiciary Committee
"the substance of significant findings"
turned up by the Special Prosecutor.
Richardson said the phrase in the
Constitution "high crimes and
misdemeanors," for which a President
can be impeached, "ought to be
subject to an interpretation broader
than ordinary crimes.
"I think it should embrace serious
abuses of presidential authority or
power, and I think it is possible to
make a strong argument that the
framers of the Constitution intended it
to embrace such abuses," he said.
'Harder All The Time'
Asked whether there was any way
Nixon could resotre confidence in his
administration, Richardson replied,
"It's getting harder all the time, but I

think he could effectively combine
three elements:
— "First," Richardson said,"Nixon
should undertake the
disclosure/cooperation with the
investigative processes." He said it
must be emphasized that "this
cooperation was complete."
— Second, Richardson said Nixon
should show "some acceptance of
theoretical responsibility, if not
personal blame." Richardson declared
he "never believed that any of the
evidence we have now convicts the
President of any crime," but added,
"The President should acknowledge
that he has responsibility. I think the
American people would tend to be
reassured that the President was sorry
about this."
— Third, Richardson said Nixon
should take solid measures "to lock
the door on such abuses in the
future." Richardson listed four areas
in which he thought abuses of
government power could be corrected:
campaign dirty tricks, campaign
financing, invasion of privacy and
accountability of the Executive
Branch.
Push For Solutions
"One of the things the President
should do," Richardson said, "is come
forward and push for remedies for the
kinds of things that have gone wrong."
Asked whether he believed the
White House explanation that two of
the subpoenaed tapes never existed,
Richardson replied, "It's perfectly
possible and I have no evidence to the
contrary."
Richardson said he currently has no
plans to run for the Presidency in
1976, but added that he wouldn't rule
out the possibility.
