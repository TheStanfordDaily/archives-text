# Court Asked To Decide Death Issue
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The answer to the question of What
constitutes death may finally be
legally resolved as the result of two
separate court cases in Oakland and
Santa Rosa.
Both cases involve heart transplants
performed by famed Stanford heart
surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway, and
both defense attorneys claim that the
donors died because of the removal of
their hearts.
In Oakland, where Andrew D.
Lyons is accused of murdering Samuel
M. Moore, Alameda Superior Court
Judge Hugh Koford last month refused
to quash a murder indictment against
Lyons.
Koford ruled, at a pre-trial hearing,
that there is enough evidence that the
bullet would have caused death to go
to trial. He set the case for Feb. 27
before Superior Court Judge William
McGuinness.
Lyons' attorney, John Cruikshank,
says that he will argue that death
occurs "when the heart stops beating."
Prosecutor Albert Meloling, a county
deputy district attorney, says he will
show that the cause of death was the
bullet in the brain, not the removal of
life support systems.
In the Santa Rosa case, the donor
was Colenda Ward, 12, who suffered
massive brain damage in an auto
accident last September. Frank Flores,
23, driver of a car in which Ward was
one of 10 persons injured in an
accident, was originally charged with
manslaughter.
Last month. Municipal Court Judge
Frank Passalacqua dismissed the
charge against Flores because he said
that the cause of death was not clear.
However, that ruling was overturned
by Sonoma County Superior Judge
Kenneth Eymann on Tuesday, saying
that Flores must stand trial on the
manslaughter charge.
In his decision, Eymann questioned
whether there was any reason why "a
criminal might escape the legal
consequences of a criminal act because
his victim or his family elects to
donate a part of his body to another."
He asked if it makes sense to say
that the doctor who performed the
transplant was responsible for Ward's
death, and answered, "This court
thinks not."
The current state law requires one
or more physicians to declare a
potential donor dead, but does not
establish the criteria to be used.
Both hearts were kept beating by a
life support system after the donors
were declared neurologically dead. The
brain death criteria are: inability to
breathe spontaneously, no brain
activity recorded by
electroencephalograms made 24 hours
apart and lack of response to
stimulation.

Lyons.
Koford ruled, at a pre-trial hearing,
that there is enough evidence that the
bullet would have caused death to go
to trial. He set the case for Feb. 27
before Superior Court Judge William
McGuinness.
Lyons' attorney, John Cruikshank,
says that he will argue that death
occurs "when the heart stops beating."
Prosecutor Albert Meloling, a county
deputy district attorney, says he will
show that the cause of death was the
bullet in the brain, not the removal of
life support systems.
In the Santa Rosa case, the donor
was Colenda Ward, 12, who suffered
massive brain damage in an auto
accident last September. Frank Flores,
23, driver of a car in which Ward was
one of 10 persons injured in an
accident, was originally charged with
manslaughter.
Last month. Municipal Court Judge
Frank Passalacqua dismissed the
charge against Flores because he said
that the cause of death was not clear.
However, that ruling was overturned
by Sonoma County Superior Judge
Kenneth Eymann on Tuesday, saying
that Flores must stand trial on the
manslaughter charge.
In his decision, Eymann questioned
whether there was any reason why "a
criminal might escape the legal
consequences of a criminal act because
his victim or his family elects to
donate a part of his body to another."
He asked if it makes sense to say
that the doctor who performed the
transplant was responsible for Ward's
death, and answered, "This court
thinks not."
The current state law requires one
or more physicians to declare a
potential donor dead, but does not
establish the criteria to be used.
Both hearts were kept beating by a
life support system after the donors
were declared neurologically dead. The
brain death criteria are: inability to
breathe spontaneously, no brain
activity recorded by
electroencephalograms made 24 hours
apart and lack of response to
stimulation.
The answer to the question of What
constitutes death may finally be
legally resolved as the result of two
separate court cases in Oakland and
Santa Rosa.
Both cases involve heart transplants
performed by famed Stanford heart
surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway, and
both defense attorneys claim that the
donors died because of the removal of
their hearts.
In Oakland, where Andrew D.
Lyons is accused of murdering Samuel
M. Moore, Alameda Superior Court
Judge Hugh Koford last month refused
to quash a murder indictment against
Lyons.
