Frank Donates Papers
Editor:
Frank Stradavarious announced
today that he is donating his personal
papers to Stanford University.
Mr. Stradavarious, who works as a
mechanic at Ben's Garage, says that
the papers cover the last thirty-five
years.
The University has not yet decided
on the disposition of the papers.
Possibilities mentioned include the
Mechanical Engineering Department,
the recycling center, the Shell station
at Campus and Serra, or the special
"Papers Dept." recently created.
It can now be revealed that the
Papers Dept. was set up to (e)valuate
and study certain recent donations by
an unnamed active president of a
North American nuclear power. The
bulk of the papers cover a wheat deal,
a milk deal, and a number of oil deals.
There are also a few shopping lists
from an unidentified first lady who
frosts her hair. The new department is
composed of professors from two
different fields — marketing and
abnormal psychology.
"It was really Reagan that started
me thinking about my taxes," revealed
Frank in an exclusive Daily interview.
"I used to think they were inevitable
like death and all that — but Ronnie
showed me I was wrong."
In response to questions about the
paper's historical value Frank grew
angry.
"I'd rather read mine than Nixon's.
There's some really good stuff here. I
went through the Pacific with the
Corps — Guadalcanal, Luzon,
Okinawa. And I went through three
wives too. What did Nixon do? A
supply officer who played poker and a
wife named Pat who I hear frosts her
hair. And what did he give? His
vice-presidential papers. A
vice-president is not only useless, he's
boring."
When asked if there was anything
really earthshaking in his donated
papers Frank just pointed to a nearby
telephone and grinned meaningfully.
Experts disagree as to the meaning
of this hint. Some believe it's a subtle
reference to the release of his old
phone bills, some of them apparently
still unpaid. But other authorities feel
that it's a sly indication that Frank has
released some, or all, of the transcripts
from his personal phone tap. These are
supposed to be quite torrid.
The legal aspects of the gift left
Frank unmoved. "I'm a great believer
in executive privilege, Rose Mary
Woods, tax write offs, and Santa
Claus" he remarked soberly before
pausing — "And I almost forgot —
America."

Planned Disaster
Editor:
Squeezed between the multitudes
of burgeoning bureaucracies is that
ever-diminishing realm called freedom.
It is limited on all sides by drooling
hordes clambering for the power —
and (unproductively earned) money —
on the webwork of a government
feeding on a productive few.
From the local windbags calling for
"consolidation" and "cityhood" and
"regional government," to eco-freaks
calling for more control over other
people's property (and lives), to
full-fledged parasites with their
"wage-price controls" and "rationing
plans," the name of the game is
control, and the goal is power over
other people's lives. It is the attempt
of unproductive asses — those who
have not, can not, and never will
produce a damned thing nor earn a
legitimate buck — to live off the
productive like so many parasites
stunting the growth of a host.
That they are productively
worthless is a fact they must hide from
themselves, and hope to keep hidden
from their victims behind a veil of
high-sounding but phony "moral
principles"like "self-sacrifice" (which
means you bleed for the
blood-suckers, but don't ask them to
bleed for you), and equally worthless
mumblings of "emergency legislation"
like the latest gas rationing plan.
The "emergency" has been forced
by a combination of environmental
laws, growth-incentive reducing price
controls and the funny-money policies
of the Federal Reserve System,
coupled with the double-cross of
foreign policies so as to curtail oil well
exploration (and impede the

deployment of alternate energy
sources), stunt the growth of refinery
capacity, and effect an abrupt end to
the oil imports on which we were
forced to become increasingly
dependent.
In other words, the "energy crisis"
is a planned disaster intended to foster
the growth of another bureaucracy, to
feed the "friendly gangs" of
incompetents and unproductives with
the power and money taken from and
at the expense of everyone else. And
like every other disaster with its
screwed-u p b igger-governmen t-is-the
remedy, it reduces the ability of the
producers to produce and to feed the
parasites.
There will eventually come a time
when the world and the U.S. in
particular is so full of these parasites
that there aren't enough of the
producers left to support them —
when they have run out of victims and
can only turn on themselves like
unthinking animals, and not live as
productive thinking beings. The
productive have no "moral
responsibility" to feed their
antagonists — that excuse has worn
out; they do have a right to
unimpeded existence.
If the aim is to end the "crisis" and
not to prolong it, the solution is not
more control but less — not to block
the way with more parasites, but to
get them the hell out of the way.

No Easy Victories
Editor:
Earlier this week, on Jan. 15, we
were provided the impetus to take a
critical view at the recent events which
have served to guide our lives. On this
historic day began the life of an
individual loved by many, scorned by
some, and envied by others. We've
faced many crises during the past few
years. Many of these unforgettable ills
are a result of inappropriate,
inefficient, and misguided leadership.
What pray tell, have we learned
from these flagrant episodes of
misjudgment? Apparently very little.
We have waged an unsuccessful and
unnecessary war in Vietnam, we have
murdered innocent defenseless
students at Kent State, Jackson State,
and Southern University, we have
exposed the Watergate Scandal, daily
we pay witness to the energy
conspiracy and yet we fail to recognize
the systematic oppression resultant
from such ruthless actions.
Did we not see the sign? The death
of the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. was indeed a perpetuation of
the systematic oppression that we
must face. Rather than sitting back on
this day and mourning the death of
the Great One, we must clearly
understand the implications of our
actions. We have not the time to sit
idly reminiscing over how it should
have been, but moreover, we must
dictate the way it will be.
Let no tears be shed, for the great
awakening to the reality of our present
condition demands actions that are
progressive in nature and positive in
application. To paraphrase the late
Amilcar Cabral, we can claim no easy
victories. The insane act of assasinating
Dr. King should not serve to halt the
impetus of the movement but rather
to stimulate and rejuvenate our
commitment and direct our course.
It is high time that people become a
part of the mechanism that demands
struggle. We must recommit our lives
to the principles for which he so freely
gave his. Take a look around. The
world is facing numerous problems
which are in effect placing the burden
of change upon you.
Dr. King was concerned with the
problems of the world. Can we claim a
similar conviction? Millions continue
to starve in the Sahel, the war in
Southeast Asia continues, leading
black individuals to continue to fall
prey to the bullets of maniacs, the list
goes on and on. I'm convinced that Dr.
Martin Luther King would have viewed
any tears we shed this day as being an
act of counterproductivity. I'm of the
opinion that any actions that would
serve to correct the injustices that
afflict us daily would be applauded by
Dr. King. It is hoped that you will take
a critical look at yourself and reaffirm
your commitment to the fulfillment of
Dr. King's eternal dream.
