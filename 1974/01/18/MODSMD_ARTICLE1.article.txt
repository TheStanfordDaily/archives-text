# Israel, Egypt Reach Compromise, Agree On Phased Troop Fullback
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel and
Egypt reached a compromise
agreement yesterday calling for a
phased pullback of Israeli forces from
the Suez Canal in exchange for
limitation of Egyptian military
strength on the waterway's east bank.
Premier Golda Meir and President
Anwar Sadat will sign separate
disengagement pacts to confirm the
accord, a senior United States official
disclosed. But the official said the
Israeli and Egyptian leaders would not
meet face to face.
The main agreement, worked out
by Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger in a week of shuttling
between the two October war foes,
will be signed at noon today at
Kilometer 101 on the Cairo-Suez road
by the Israeli and Egyptian military
commanders.
Both Eban and Yigal Allon, the
deputy premier who spoke to the
nation on television, did not disclose
more than the bare outline of the pact.
Significantly, Allon said that through
Kissinger the two countries had also
reached "oral understandings."
Turning Point
Similar announcements of the
disengagement agreement were made
in Egypt and by President Nixon in
Washington. Eban said he hoped "it
would mark a turning point, a first
initial, but nevertheless important,
step on the road toward peace in the
Middle East."
Eban said Israel was prepared to
hold disengagement talks with Syria,
its other major opponent in the
October war. Kissinger plans to fly to
Damascus in a bid to persuade the
Syrians to join the moves toward a
settlement.
Allon, who replaced ailing Premier
Golda Meir as chief Israeli negotiator
with Kissinger, said he could not give
details of the pact. But from his
television remarks, these points
emerged:
Israeli Withdrawal
— Israel will withdraw "a
reasonable distance" east of the
103-mile canal, giving up both the
southwest shore it captured in the
October fighting and the eastern bank
it took in the 1967 war.

— A United Nations peace force
will form a wedge separating the two
sides.
— Israel expects the agreement to
be implemented "in a fair number of
weeks, not months."
— Allon implied this would not be
Israel's final withdrawal in Sinai and
"we will not create a long-term status
quo" out of disengagement. The
agreement would preface more
withdrawals in the framework of a
peace treaty, he indicated.
Egyptian Cutback
Unofficial sources said Egypt
agreed to reduce its force east of the
canal to eight battalions or 5000 to
8000 men. The Egyptians would
install no anti-aircraft missiles in their
enclave and their armor strength
would be stripped to a token force of
about 30 tanks, the sources said.
"The agreement does not give
either side an advantage over the
other," Allon said. "The conditions
are good, maybe not excellent but
very good."
Allon heaped praise on Kissinger
saying his "indispensible role could
not be repaid in gold."
Fruitful Result
Along the same lines, Eban said,
"We believe that it was an exemplary
exercise in international conciliation
and we hope that the result will be
fruitful for the future of the Middle
East."
Allon said that under the new
agreement the chances of renewed war
would shrink. Egypt could not attack
without harming the U.N. force. If
Cairo ordered the force to leave, it
would be a warning to Israel that
would rule out a surprise attack, he
added.
The U.N. force would deter
"incidental outbreaks of fighting,"
while the new deployment of forces
would prevent both sides from "a
surprise attack or a war of attrition,"
he declared.
Allon's remarks seemed unusually
conciliatory toward Egypt. He said he
was sure Cairo would now concentrate
on "economic and social problems"
caused by the war, and refrain from
attacking Israel.
Allon said Israel would withdraw to

"shortened truce lines, leaning on
shorter supply lines . .. enabling Israel
to release a large number of its reserve
troops."
The prolonged call-up of Israel's
reserve army to guard the tangled
truce lines has severely damaged the
economy and increased Israel's
eagerness for troop separation.
Premier Meir, who has been
confined to her home with a shingles
attack, is to address the Knesset,
Israel's Parliament, Tuesday on the
agreement.
Any hopes that the disengagement
agreement might impel the Arab oil
nations to call off their cutbacks on
production also appeared doomed by a
comment from Saudi Arabia's oil
minister who said his nation — the
Arab world's leading oil producer —
would not increase production until
Israel vacates all Arab territories taken

in 1967.
Kissinger's latest success at Middle
East diplomacy opened the door today
to resumption of Geneva negotiations
for a final peace pact.
The negotiators at Geneva must
grapple eventually with the problem of
the dispossessed Palestinians, the
Arabs who fled their homes when
Israel was born 25 years ago.
Israel wants them absorbed into the
Arab world. But Egypt calls for "full
restoration of their legitimate rights,"
a term Israel claims is a euphemism for
destructions of the Jewish state.
Meanwhile, Nixon called the
disengagement agreement "a very
significant step... toward a
permanent peace in the Middle East."
The British government
congratulated Egypt, Israel and
Kissinger on a "significant
achievement."

Allon said Israel would withdraw to

"shortened truce lines, leaning on
shorter supply lines . .. enabling Israel

troops."
The prolonged call-up of Israel's
reserve army to guard the tangled
truce lines has severely damaged the
economy and increased Israel's
eagerness for troop separation.

confined to her home with a shingles
attack, is to address the Knesset,

Any hopes that the disengagement

Arab world's leading oil producer —
would not increase production until
Israel vacates all Arab territories taken

in 1967.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel and
Egypt reached a compromise
agreement yesterday calling for a
phased pullback of Israeli forces from
the Suez Canal in exchange for
limitation of Egyptian military
strength on the waterway's east bank.
Premier Golda Meir and President
Anwar Sadat will sign separate
disengagement pacts to confirm the
accord, a senior United States official
disclosed. But the official said the
Israeli and Egyptian leaders would not
meet face to face.
The main agreement, worked out
by Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger in a week of shuttling
between the two October war foes,
will be signed at noon today at
Kilometer 101 on the Cairo-Suez road
by the Israeli and Egyptian military
commanders.
Both Eban and Yigal Allon, the
deputy premier who spoke to the
nation on television, did not disclose
more than the bare outline of the pact.
Significantly, Allon said that through
Kissinger the two countries had also
reached "oral understandings."
Turning Point
Similar announcements of the
disengagement agreement were made
in Egypt and by President Nixon in
Washington. Eban said he hoped "it
would mark a turning point, a first
initial, but nevertheless important,
step on the road toward peace in the
Middle East."
Eban said Israel was prepared to
hold disengagement talks with Syria,
its other major opponent in the
October war. Kissinger plans to fly to
Damascus in a bid to persuade the
Syrians to join the moves toward a
settlement.
Allon, who replaced ailing Premier
Golda Meir as chief Israeli negotiator
with Kissinger, said he could not give
details of the pact. But from his
television remarks, these points
emerged:
Israeli Withdrawal
— Israel will withdraw "a
reasonable distance" east of the
103-mile canal, giving up both the
southwest shore it captured in the
October fighting and the eastern bank
it took in the 1967 war.

— A United Nations peace force
will form a wedge separating the two
sides.
— Israel expects the agreement to
be implemented "in a fair number of
weeks, not months."
— Allon implied this would not be
Israel's final withdrawal in Sinai and
"we will not create a long-term status
quo" out of disengagement. The
agreement would preface more
withdrawals in the framework of a
peace treaty, he indicated.
Egyptian Cutback
Unofficial sources said Egypt
agreed to reduce its force east of the
canal to eight battalions or 5000 to
8000 men. The Egyptians would
install no anti-aircraft missiles in their
enclave and their armor strength
would be stripped to a token force of
about 30 tanks, the sources said.
"The agreement does not give
either side an advantage over the
other," Allon said. "The conditions
are good, maybe not excellent but
very good."
Allon heaped praise on Kissinger
saying his "indispensible role could
not be repaid in gold."
Fruitful Result
Along the same lines, Eban said,
"We believe that it was an exemplary
exercise in international conciliation
and we hope that the result will be
fruitful for the future of the Middle
East."
Allon said that under the new
agreement the chances of renewed war
would shrink. Egypt could not attack
without harming the U.N. force. If
Cairo ordered the force to leave, it
would be a warning to Israel that
would rule out a surprise attack, he
added.
The U.N. force would deter
"incidental outbreaks of fighting,"
while the new deployment of forces
would prevent both sides from "a
surprise attack or a war of attrition,"
he declared.
Allon's remarks seemed unusually
conciliatory toward Egypt. He said he
was sure Cairo would now concentrate
on "economic and social problems"
caused by the war, and refrain from
attacking Israel.

— Israel expects the agreement to
be implemented "in a fair number of
weeks, not months."
— Allon implied this would not be
Israel's final withdrawal in Sinai and
"we will not create a long-term status
quo" out of disengagement. The
agreement would preface more
withdrawals in the framework of a
peace treaty, he indicated.
Egyptian Cutback
Unofficial sources said Egypt
agreed to reduce its force east of the
canal to eight battalions or 5000 to
8000 men. The Egyptians would
install no anti-aircraft missiles in their
enclave and their armor strength
would be stripped to a token force of
about 30 tanks, the sources said.
"The agreement does not give
either side an advantage over the
other," Allon said. "The conditions
are good, maybe not excellent but
very good."
Allon heaped praise on Kissinger
saying his "indispensible role could
not be repaid in gold."
Fruitful Result
Along the same lines, Eban said,
"We believe that it was an exemplary
exercise in international conciliation
and we hope that the result will be
fruitful for the future of the Middle
East."
Allon said that under the new
agreement the chances of renewed war
would shrink. Egypt could not attack
without harming the U.N. force. If
Cairo ordered the force to leave, it
would be a warning to Israel that
would rule out a surprise attack, he
added.
The U.N. force would deter
"incidental outbreaks of fighting,"
while the new deployment of forces
would prevent both sides from "a
surprise attack or a war of attrition,"
he declared.
Allon's remarks seemed unusually
conciliatory toward Egypt. He said he
was sure Cairo would now concentrate
on "economic and social problems"
caused by the war, and refrain from
attacking Israel.
Allon said Israel would withdraw to

"shortened truce lines, leaning on
shorter supply lines . .. enabling Israel
to release a large number of its reserve
troops."
The prolonged call-up of Israel's
reserve army to guard the tangled
truce lines has severely damaged the
economy and increased Israel's
eagerness for troop separation.
Premier Meir, who has been
confined to her home with a shingles
attack, is to address the Knesset,
Israel's Parliament, Tuesday on the
agreement.
Any hopes that the disengagement
agreement might impel the Arab oil
nations to call off their cutbacks on
production also appeared doomed by a
comment from Saudi Arabia's oil
minister who said his nation — the
Arab world's leading oil producer —
would not increase production until
Israel vacates all Arab territories taken

in 1967.
Kissinger's latest success at Middle
East diplomacy opened the door today
to resumption of Geneva negotiations
for a final peace pact.
The negotiators at Geneva must
grapple eventually with the problem of
the dispossessed Palestinians, the
Arabs who fled their homes when
Israel was born 25 years ago.
Israel wants them absorbed into the
Arab world. But Egypt calls for "full
restoration of their legitimate rights,"
a term Israel claims is a euphemism for
destructions of the Jewish state.
Meanwhile, Nixon called the
disengagement agreement "a very
significant step... toward a
permanent peace in the Middle East."
The British government
congratulated Egypt, Israel and
Kissinger on a "significant
achievement."

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel and
Egypt reached a compromise
agreement yesterday calling for a
phased pullback of Israeli forces from
the Suez Canal in exchange for
limitation of Egyptian military
strength on the waterway's east bank.
Premier Golda Meir and President
Anwar Sadat will sign separate
disengagement pacts to confirm the
accord, a senior United States official
disclosed. But the official said the
Israeli and Egyptian leaders would not
meet face to face.
The main agreement, worked out
by Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger in a week of shuttling
between the two October war foes,
will be signed at noon today at
Kilometer 101 on the Cairo-Suez road
by the Israeli and Egyptian military
commanders.
Both Eban and Yigal Allon, the
deputy premier who spoke to the
nation on television, did not disclose
more than the bare outline of the pact.
Significantly, Allon said that through
Kissinger the two countries had also
reached "oral understandings."
Turning Point
Similar announcements of the
disengagement agreement were made
in Egypt and by President Nixon in
Washington. Eban said he hoped "it
would mark a turning point, a first
initial, but nevertheless important,
step on the road toward peace in the
Middle East."
Eban said Israel was prepared to
hold disengagement talks with Syria,
its other major opponent in the
October war. Kissinger plans to fly to
Damascus in a bid to persuade the
Syrians to join the moves toward a
settlement.
Allon, who replaced ailing Premier
Golda Meir as chief Israeli negotiator
with Kissinger, said he could not give
details of the pact. But from his
television remarks, these points
emerged:
Israeli Withdrawal
— Israel will withdraw "a
reasonable distance" east of the
103-mile canal, giving up both the
southwest shore it captured in the
October fighting and the eastern bank
it took in the 1967 war.

— A United Nations peace force
will form a wedge separating the two
sides.
— Israel expects the agreement to
be implemented "in a fair number of
weeks, not months."
— Allon implied this would not be
Israel's final withdrawal in Sinai and
"we will not create a long-term status
quo" out of disengagement. The
agreement would preface more
withdrawals in the framework of a
