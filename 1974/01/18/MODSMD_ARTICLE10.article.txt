# Strolling Down Cowell Lane
## The 						Delights Of Being Sick At Stanford 
### 
"If you've got your health, you've
got just about everything." This trite
phrase from the TV commercial for
the miracle drug Geritol is, to a certain
extent, quite true. Neglected, however,
in its simplistic "catchiness" are all the
delightful experiences one encounters
upon losing one's health.
Take, for example, the plight of our
good friend, Joe Frosh. How shallow
this young life might have remained
had he not ventured that sunny
afternoon to the catacombs of Cowell
Student Health Center. His foxy,
blonde RA had put the idea of flu
shots in his impressionable mind, and
by the time he had sneezed thrice, he
found himself hightailing over to
Cowell.
After a pleasant wait during which
a number of patients discussed the
relative merits of smallpox, malaria
and diptheria. Joe was admitted to the
immunization room. The
administrating nurse asked him if he
was allergic to chickens, if he had a
cold and if the insertion of needles
into his arm caused him to attack
helpless nurses. When he answered
negatively, she obliged him by
squirting a fresh vial of syrum "A"
into his goose-bumped flesh.
As he walked down Campus Drive
after leaving Cowell, his heart was full;
for he knew he was invulnerable and
had Leland Stanford's promise for the
best of health.
The next morning he awoke with a
vicious sore throat that quickly
matured into laryngytis. Besides being
disillusioned with modern medicine
and totally upset with himself forever
trusting the syringe over vitamin C, he
felt exceedingly inept for not being
able to communiate without a pad and
pencil.
Every time he passed someone in
the hall, he was greeted with such
inspiring phrases as, "Would you stop
yelling?," "God, you're noisy; would
you mind shutting up?" and others,
equally empathetic with his state of
mouth.

Taking the influenzal cake — as it
were — was ihe evening Joe sat at
dinner with six of his "buddies."
Halfway through the meal — which,
incidentally, seemed as tasty as
dehydrated litmus paper — Joe's good
friend Thorn grabbed his dinner knife
and banged the metal leg of the table.
The dining hall became dead quiet and
all eyes fixed on Joe's table. With a
wide, sadistic grin, Thom stood tall
and stated: "Joe has an announcement
to make!"
As could be expected, Joe squirmed
uncomfortably, and with a minimum
of effort, proceeded to turn into a
tomato. Folks say a redder face hasn't
been seen since.
Against his better judgment, Joe
returned to Cowell the very next day.
After waiting the required half hour
while the receptionist looked under
"J" for his medical file, he was taken
to the second ante room where the
sick masses are hidden to keep from
discouraging newcomers to the center.
There was a girl and a guy ahead of
him to see Dr. Curall. The girl was
called, and emerged several minutes
later with a circular red container.
"Birth control pills!" thought Joe. The
guy was summoned next, and he came
out with the same circular red
container. "Maybe not birth control
pills. .." pondered Joe. Not until Joe
had the good doctor take a culture
from his own aching throat did he
realize the red container was a petri
dish and not a box of BCP's.
Of course, the test for strep was
negative, but his misery marched on.
The next day was his birthday, and he
couldn't breathe because histaminic
fungus was clogging his nasal tract.
Giving in to his illness, he decided to
go to bed early. His body didn't listen,
however, and it was a good two hours
,before he finally dropped out of
conscious sight.
At the stroke of midnight, the
ultimate delight occurred. Thirty
hysterical "buddies" sneaked into his

quiet bedroom, and with an artillery
of whistles and horns, proceeded to
wake poor Joe to "celebrate" the
dawning of HIS day. A few choruses
of those gross songs sung at such
occasions were howled, after which a
thoughtful gift was presented which
Joe felt like consuming in its entirety

to forget life altogether.
Anyway, it is Joe's sincere desire
that everyone may, at some time, have
the pleasure of being sick in a Stanford
dormitory.

undergraduate.)

into his arm caused him to attack
helpless nurses. When he answered
negatively, she obliged him by
squirting a fresh vial of syrum "A"
into his goose-bumped flesh.
As he walked down Campus Drive
after leaving Cowell, his heart was full;
for he knew he was invulnerable and
had Leland Stanford's promise for the
best of health.
The next morning he awoke with a
vicious sore throat that quickly
matured into laryngytis. Besides being
disillusioned with modern medicine
and totally upset with himself forever
trusting the syringe over vitamin C, he
felt exceedingly inept for not being
able to communiate without a pad and
pencil.
Every time he passed someone in
the hall, he was greeted with such
inspiring phrases as, "Would you stop
yelling?," "God, you're noisy; would
you mind shutting up?" and others,
equally empathetic with his state of
mouth.

Taking the influenzal cake — as it
were — was ihe evening Joe sat at
dinner with six of his "buddies."
Halfway through the meal — which,
incidentally, seemed as tasty as
dehydrated litmus paper — Joe's good
friend Thorn grabbed his dinner knife
and banged the metal leg of the table.
The dining hall became dead quiet and
all eyes fixed on Joe's table. With a
wide, sadistic grin, Thom stood tall
and stated: "Joe has an announcement
to make!"
As could be expected, Joe squirmed
uncomfortably, and with a minimum
of effort, proceeded to turn into a
tomato. Folks say a redder face hasn't
been seen since.
Against his better judgment, Joe
returned to Cowell the very next day.
After waiting the required half hour
while the receptionist looked under
"J" for his medical file, he was taken
to the second ante room where the
sick masses are hidden to keep from
discouraging newcomers to the center.
There was a girl and a guy ahead of
him to see Dr. Curall. The girl was
called, and emerged several minutes
later with a circular red container.
"Birth control pills!" thought Joe. The
guy was summoned next, and he came
out with the same circular red
container. "Maybe not birth control
pills. .." pondered Joe. Not until Joe
had the good doctor take a culture
from his own aching throat did he
realize the red container was a petri
dish and not a box of BCP's.
Of course, the test for strep was
negative, but his misery marched on.
The next day was his birthday, and he
couldn't breathe because histaminic
fungus was clogging his nasal tract.
Giving in to his illness, he decided to
go to bed early. His body didn't listen,
however, and it was a good two hours
,before he finally dropped out of
conscious sight.
At the stroke of midnight, the
ultimate delight occurred. Thirty
hysterical "buddies" sneaked into his

quiet bedroom, and with an artillery
of whistles and horns, proceeded to
wake poor Joe to "celebrate" the
dawning of HIS day. A few choruses
of those gross songs sung at such
occasions were howled, after which a
thoughtful gift was presented which
Joe felt like consuming in its entirety

to forget life altogether.
Anyway, it is Joe's sincere desire
that everyone may, at some time, have
the pleasure of being sick in a Stanford
dormitory.
(Doug Witkins is a Stanford
undergraduate.)
"If you've got your health, you've
got just about everything." This trite
phrase from the TV commercial for
the miracle drug Geritol is, to a certain
extent, quite true. Neglected, however,
in its simplistic "catchiness" are all the
delightful experiences one encounters
upon losing one's health.
Take, for example, the plight of our
good friend, Joe Frosh. How shallow
this young life might have remained
had he not ventured that sunny
afternoon to the catacombs of Cowell
Student Health Center. His foxy,
blonde RA had put the idea of flu
shots in his impressionable mind, and
by the time he had sneezed thrice, he
found himself hightailing over to
Cowell.
After a pleasant wait during which
a number of patients discussed the
relative merits of smallpox, malaria
and diptheria. Joe was admitted to the
immunization room. The
administrating nurse asked him if he
was allergic to chickens, if he had a
cold and if the insertion of needles
into his arm caused him to attack
helpless nurses. When he answered
negatively, she obliged him by
squirting a fresh vial of syrum "A"

Halfway through the meal — which,
incidentally, seemed as tasty as
dehydrated litmus paper — Joe's good
friend Thorn grabbed his dinner knife
and banged the metal leg of the table.
The dining hall became dead quiet and
all eyes fixed on Joe's table. With a
wide, sadistic grin, Thom stood tall
and stated: "Joe has an announcement
to make!"
As could be expected, Joe squirmed
uncomfortably, and with a minimum
of effort, proceeded to turn into a
tomato. Folks say a redder face hasn't
been seen since.
Against his better judgment, Joe
returned to Cowell the very next day.
After waiting the required half hour
while the receptionist looked under
"J" for his medical file, he was taken
to the second ante room where the
sick masses are hidden to keep from
discouraging newcomers to the center.
There was a girl and a guy ahead of
him to see Dr. Curall. The girl was
called, and emerged several minutes
later with a circular red container.
"Birth control pills!" thought Joe. The
guy was summoned next, and he came
out with the same circular red
container. "Maybe not birth control
pills. .." pondered Joe. Not until Joe
had the good doctor take a culture
from his own aching throat did he
realize the red container was a petri
dish and not a box of BCP's.
Of course, the test for strep was
negative, but his misery marched on.
The next day was his birthday, and he
couldn't breathe because histaminic
fungus was clogging his nasal tract.
Giving in to his illness, he decided to
go to bed early. His body didn't listen,
however, and it was a good two hours
,before he finally dropped out of
conscious sight.
At the stroke of midnight, the
ultimate delight occurred. Thirty
hysterical "buddies" sneaked into his

quiet bedroom, and with an artillery
of whistles and horns, proceeded to
wake poor Joe to "celebrate" the
dawning of HIS day. A few choruses
of those gross songs sung at such
occasions were howled, after which a
thoughtful gift was presented which
Joe felt like consuming in its entirety

Doug Witkins

to forget life altogether.
Anyway, it is Joe's sincere desire
that everyone may, at some time, have
the pleasure of being sick in a Stanford
dormitory.
