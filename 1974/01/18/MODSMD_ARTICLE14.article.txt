to it that there were schools,
materials, and qualified teachers
ready and available when my
generation needed them. I am
pleased by this gift to join those
who have done that job in the
past, and I invite all others to do
what they can now."
While trained as an economist,
Sharpe, 39, has been distinguished
for his scholarship in finance as

well as economics.
He is author of five books and
numerous articles in professional
journals. Among his works are
The Economics of Computers,
considered a landmark study;
Portfolio Theory and Capital
Markets, a work which has had a
major influence in the investment
industry; BASIC: An Introduction
to Computer Programming Using
the BASIC (computer) Language;
and An Introduction to

Washington after five years as an
economist with the Rand
Corporation. He spent seven years
