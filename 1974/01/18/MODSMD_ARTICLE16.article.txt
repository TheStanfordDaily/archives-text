# University Relations Office At Work
## 'Lobbying' Not The Word 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
"You do understand," the icy
voice on the phone said, "that as
far as the University is concerned
it has no representatives
undertaking any lobbying efforts
whatsoever."
Well, not exactly. Even if it
isn't a very large part of its
budget, the University Relations
office here considers lobbying for
the University one of its primary
functions.
"Do we lobby? Absolutely,"

said Frank Newman, director of
University Relations. "Of course
we do. As a matter of fact, we
haven't been good enough at it."
The problem with the word
"lobbying," Newman said, rests
on "a technical distinction." In
legal terms, - a lobbyist is one
whose primary activity is the
influence of legislation. The
activities of University officials in
promoting better government
relations is much broader — hence
a reluctance to use the word

"lobby," which also carries
unpleasant connotations of
backroom influence.
Government relations,
Newman said, extend far beyond
simply asking for increased federal
funding.
"Our Washington problems
increasingly deal all the way
across the board," he said. 'The
universities have been taken out
of their ivory tower. Once the
universities could count on special
treatment; that's all changed. We
have to deal with the whole
problem of tax reform, with the
application of the National Labor
Relations Act. The government's
in on everything here these days."
One recent problem, Newman
said, was a proposal by the
Environmental Protection Agency
to tax parking spaces on the
premises of large employers.
"We've been very concerned
with the proposed EPA
regulations," Asst. Director
Robert Freelen explained. "In
certain areas, employers with
more than a certain number of
parking spaces would be assessed,
on a formula basis, fees in a range
of $360 per year per space above
750 to a maximum of $450 a
year. Stanford's geographical
location means that most
University employees drive to
work. It's a problem peculiar to
this University. It could kill us."
Early this month, the EPA

dropped the proposal.
Most of the University's
Washington lobbying is carried on
through associations like the
American Association of
Universities, Newman said. Tax
reform, for example, is a problem
that concerns all private
universities; it's more efficient to
present the universities' case for
maintaining contributions'
tax-exempt status as a group. But
in some cases — like the EPA
parking regulations — Stanford is
particularly interested.
The University has no
permanent Washington
representative, however. "We
operate out of here," Newman
said. "People in Washington tend
to get a Washington, rather than
University, perspective — they
tend to be professional lobbyists
rathe;than professional
educators."
Instead, Newman said, most
government relations are carried
on first-hand by President Richard
Lyman, Provost William F. Miller,
Freelen and himself.
"There's a clear distinction
between contracts and grants, and
government relations, which we
interpret as being policy," Freelen
said. "Finding contracts and
grants is a matter for individual
researchers and the Research
Administration Office. If policy is
being set, then we're interested."
