# Computer To Help Medical Research
## 
### 
Medical Center News Service
A five-year federal grant of $2.75 million has been awarded to the
School of Medicine to establish the first shared national computer
facility for medical research.
The computer, expected to serve as an important research tool in
problem solving and analyzing data, will be used by medical
investigators throughout the country on a time shared basis.
Funded by the Division of Research Resources of the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), the facility will be known as the SUMEX
— Stanford University Medical Experimental Computer — and
directed by Dr. Joshua Lederberg, professor and chairman of the
Department of Genetics.
The two main objectives of the SUMEX program, Lederberg said,
are the development (with the NIH Biotechnology Resources Branch)
of the relatively new concept of national shared resources, and the
further exploration of computer science applications in medicine.
Initially, SUMEX will consist of a powerful PDP-10 computer,
scheduled to be delivered and installed in April. The computer will be
available to approved users through a computer-communication
network.
The primary focus of the SUMEX project, Lederberg said, will be
an applications of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM). A national
AIM coordinating group, now being organized, will advise on the
management of the facility and review applications for eligibility to
use it.
Artificial intelligence is a part of computer science concerned with
the symbol-manipulation processes that produce intelligent action.
Rather than employing the digital computer as merely a number
calculator, scientists in this field utilize the computer to reach
decisions and solve problems through symbolic analysis and reasoning.
SUMEX will be staffed by a group of scientists experienced in
artificial intelligence techniques, Lederberg said.
