# Windsor Cutting Lectureship
## Euler To Lecture At Med School 
### 
Medical Center Newsservice
Dr. Ulf S. von Euler, a Swedish
neurophysiologist who won the
1970 Nobel Prize in medicine and
physiology for his studies of the
chemistry of the central nervous
system, will give the first Windsor
Cutting Lecture at the School of
Medicine Monday, January 21.
He will speak on "Some
Problems Related to Adrenergic
Neurotransmission" at 4:15 p.m.
in Room MlO6 of the Medical
School. The lecture is open to the
medical community and the
public.

Dr. von Euler is professor of
physiology emeritus at the
Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm. He studied how nerve
impulses are transmitted
chemically across minute
insulating gaps — synapses —
which separate nerve from nerve
or nerve from muscle. In 1947 he
demonstrated that the transmitter
substance which diffuses from the
ends of stimulated, sympathetic
nerves to bridge the synaptic gap
is noradrenaline.
This work, according to the
Karolinska Institute, led to the

Nobel Prize which he shared with
Sir Bernard Katz and Julius
Axelrod. Dr. von Euler's work has
also stimulated the search for
remedies against nervous and
mental disturbances.
Dr. von Euler began his career
at the Karolinska Institute in
1930 as assistant professor and
advanced through the ranks to
professor of phsiology in 1939.
He is a member of the Swedish
Medical Research Council, and has
served as chairman of the board of
the Nobel Foundation since 1965.
From 1965 to 1971 he was vice
president of the International
Union of Biological Sciences. He
is a member of the Swedish
Academy of Sciences.
He is the author of
Noradrenaline (1956),
Comparative Endocrinology with
Hans Heller (1963), Structure and
Function of Inhibitory Neuronal
Mechanisms (1966); and many
papers on endocrinology.
The Windsor Cutting
Lectureship was established in
1973 by the faculty of the
Department of Pharmacology, and
supported by private
contributions. It honors the
memory of Dr. Windsor Cutting,
professor and former chairman of
the Department of Pharmacology,
who also served as dean of the
School of Medicine (1953-57),
and dean of the University of
Hawaii Medical School (1963-71).
Dr. Cutting died in 1972.
The lectures, given annually
during the Winter quarter, feature
speakers prominent in the field of
pharmacology.

professor of phsiology in 1939.
He is a member of the Swedish
Medical Research Council, and has
served as chairman of the board of
the Nobel Foundation since 1965.
From 1965 to 1971 he was vice
president of the International
Union of Biological Sciences. He
is a member of the Swedish
Academy of Sciences.
He is the author of
Noradrenaline (1956),
Comparative Endocrinology with
Hans Heller (1963), Structure and
Function of Inhibitory Neuronal
Mechanisms (1966); and many
papers on endocrinology.
The Windsor Cutting
Lectureship was established in
1973 by the faculty of the
Department of Pharmacology, and
supported by private
contributions. It honors the
memory of Dr. Windsor Cutting,
professor and former chairman of
the Department of Pharmacology,
who also served as dean of the
School of Medicine (1953-57),
and dean of the University of
Hawaii Medical School (1963-71).
Dr. Cutting died in 1972.
The lectures, given annually
during the Winter quarter, feature
speakers prominent in the field of
pharmacology.

Dr. Ulf S. von Euler, a Swedish
neurophysiologist who won the
1970 Nobel Prize in medicine and
physiology for his studies of the
chemistry of the central nervous
system, will give the first Windsor
Cutting Lecture at the School of
Medicine Monday, January 21.
He will speak on "Some
Problems Related to Adrenergic
Neurotransmission" at 4:15 p.m.
in Room MlO6 of the Medical
School. The lecture is open to the
medical community and the
public.

Dr. von Euler is professor of
physiology emeritus at the
Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm. He studied how nerve
impulses are transmitted
chemically across minute
insulating gaps — synapses —
which separate nerve from nerve
or nerve from muscle. In 1947 he
demonstrated that the transmitter
substance which diffuses from the
ends of stimulated, sympathetic
nerves to bridge the synaptic gap
is noradrenaline.
This work, according to the
Karolinska Institute, led to the

Nobel Prize which he shared with
Sir Bernard Katz and Julius
Axelrod. Dr. von Euler's work has
also stimulated the search for
remedies against nervous and
mental disturbances.
Dr. von Euler began his career
at the Karolinska Institute in
1930 as assistant professor and
advanced through the ranks to
professor of phsiology in 1939.
