# McCloskey Declares Congress Candidacy
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo
Park, declared his candidacy for
reelection to Congress yesterday and
said he would not accept any
campaign contributions in excess of
$100.
McCloskey is seeking reelection in
the new 12th District, which stretches
from southern Redwood City to
northern San Jose and includes
Stanford and Palo Alto.
In a prepared statement delivered
to a San Francisco press conference,
McCloskey proposed a five-part
campaign practices plan which, he
said, is "designed to give a full and fair
public exposure to any Republican
primary opponent."
Conservative Atherton businessman
J. Gordon Knapp is expected to
oppose McCloskey in the Republican
primary in June. Knapp received about
nine percent of the vote as a write-in
candidate in the 1972 general election.
'No Contribution Over $100'
McCloskey said he expects to spend
no more than $75,000 in the campaign
and added that, as of Jan. 1, 790
people had contributed $22,879.04 to
his reelection bid, "no contribution
being in excess of $100.
"I am going to ask all of my
supporters to contribute between $10
and $25, depending on their income,"
McCloskey said. "It seems to me broad
public support, financially indicated
by small campaign contributions from
large numbers of people, is the answer
to much of the corruption which the
Watergate story is continuing to
unveil."
The maverick Republican, who has
represented the midpeninsula since
1967, also proposed:
Debates Proposed
— a "100-debate campaign" which
would bring him back to the district at
least seven times in March, April and
May to debate his primary opposition
"with at least one debate within
walking distance of each home in the
12th District";
— congressional enactment of laws
providing for two free mailings by
no n - in cu m be nt candidates,

"minimally-expensive radio and
television coverage of debates," and a
campaign contribution reform which
would limit individual contributions to
$1000 or less;
— and public disclosure this year of
each candidate's personal financial
situation.
McCloskey himself released a
statement of net worth and taxable
income for 1973, revealing that he
made over $67,000 last year, including
more than $22,000 in speech
honoraria.
"I hope these five steps will assist in
some small manner to return public
faith in at least l/435th of American
politics," McCloskey said.
Predicts Impeachment
After his formal statement,
McCloskey predicted that the House
of Representatives will vote to
impeach President Nixon in April or
May, and said the President "is
obviously guilty of crimes."

ON THE ROAD AGAIN — Congressman Pete McCloskey, who talked with
Stanford students in Tresidder Lounge Wednesday, announced his bid for
reelection at a press conference in San Francisco yesterday. He plans to limit his
campaign contributions to $100 or less.
When contacted by the Daily
yesterday, McCloskey said he did not
ftxpect additional primary opposition
butside of Knapp. "I don't think the
big conservative money men are going
to want more than one candidate,"
McCloskey said.
He predicted "a hard tough
campaign," pointing to a December
straw poll taken in the Sharon Heights
region of Menlo Park. The poll
revealed that only 30 percent of the
200 voters contacted were favorable to
McCloskey, with 50 percent
unfavorable and 20 percent undecided.
McCloskey said this attitude was
''consistent with the
support-the-President syndrome."
