# Non-Contact Disk Throwing
## Ultimate For Frisbee People 
### GEORGE POWELL 
"Wham-0 makes lousy
Frisbees," according to
sophomore John Hadley, who
ought to know. Hadley is a
confirmed Frisbee freak who has
been involved in promoting the
sport of ultimate frisbee since his
high school days.
Ultimate frisbee is a team sport
for frisbee lovers invented by

some of friends of Hadley's at
Columbia High School in
Maplewood, New Jersey in 1969.
Up until then, the only
competition for Frisbee freaks
had been "guts" with five-person
(more or less) teams standing
opposite each other throwing the
disc back and forth. Points are
awarded when the opposition fails
to catch the frisbee.
This stationary game didn't
satisfy Hadley's friends, who
devised ultimate frisbee, with
seven or more persons on a side.
According to the rule book, the
sport is "fast-moving, competitive
and non-contact." The object is to
get points by scoring goals, which
are made by one player
successfully passing the frisbee to
a teammate in the opponents end
zone.
According to Hadley, who has
a large file of newspaper clippings
about East Coast frisbee, the sport
has caught on rapidly at high
schools and colleges. A college
league was formed in 1972, when
the first ultimate frisbee
intercollegiate competition was
held â€” Rugters against Princeton.
Rugters won the match, repeating
the victory over Princeton in the
first intercollegiate football game
over 100 years ago.
Ultimate frisbee has some of
the elements of football, soccer
and hockey, but without the body

contact. Players cannot interfere
physically with opponents passes,
but can block, intercept or kncok
them down.
And who enforces the rules?
Usually no one, according to
Hadley. Although there may be a
referee, the rules provide for an
honor system, with any disputes
settled by "the flipping of a coin"
or some other method. One
combined timer-scorekeeper is
needed to keep track of time outs
(three are permitted in each
24-minute half) and goals.
Stanford currently has ultimate
frisbee club team, and frisbee
freaks in Berkeley have expressed
some interest, Hadley says.
Wham-O, the company that
copyrighted the frisbee, also has
shown some interest, but mostly
in "stealing our game," Hadley
said in a resigned tone.
After paying Hadley and his
friends $100 to help with printing
costs for "The Official Rules of
Ultimate Frisbee," Wham-0
copyrighted Team Frisbee, a game
with similar rules, but kept it
secret from Hadley and his
friends.
"We found out about Team
Frisbee for the first time last
summer," Hadley said when he
and other ultimate frisbee freaks
went to the International
tournament in Houghton,
Michigan.
