Following is the draft text of a statement on Stanford
land use and proposed land use policies, prepared by
Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger and discussed with
the Imnd and Building Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees Jan. 8.
Copies have been given the University Committee on
Land and Building Development for their consideration
and comment and also are being made available to local
government officials prior to any trustee action. Hope
fully, the University Committee will be prepared to
report on the proposed statement and policies by the
March 12 Board of Trustees meeting.
At this time, when various governmental bodies are in
the process of developing long-range comprehensive
plans for their respective jurisdictions, it appears appro
priate that the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
review and restate the principles and policies that govern
the use of the University's lands in Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, consisting of approximately 8,100
acres. This position paper is intended to provide the
background for these policy decisions.
Characteristics of Stanford University
Any determination of land use is dependent upon an
understanding of the characteristics and purposes of the
institution. Stanford University is:
1. A residential university: The educational process,
particularly at the undergraduate level, is based upon a
close interrelationship of classroom, laboratory, library
and residence teaching facilities. From its inception, the
physical plans for Stanford have contemplated that stu
dents and faculty would, to the extent possible, live in
close proximity to each other and to their teaching and
research facilities.
2. A research institution: The hallmark of a distin
guished university is the interaction between teaching
and research. The vitality of teaching depends on the
advancement of knowledge through original research,
and scholarship is kept alive through the training of
young and lively minds. Furthermore, if research is to be
more than a sterile exercise, those who engage in it
require the opportunity for close interaction with public
and private sponsors and with users of research as well.
3. A dynamic institution: Universities are by nature
conservative institutions in the sense that they are
charged with conserving and teaching the best of man's
past learning. But they are also by their nature engaged
in change, both adjusting to the changing world around
them and providing the intellectual stimulus for the
forces which will produce change.
4. A private institution: Stanford was founded and
organized as a private trust, and its on-going financial
support and operations are derived primarily from pri
vate sources—tuition, gifts, and endowment. While Stan
ford receives public monies in return for specific serv
ices, its ability to remain an independent, self-determi
ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.
6. A national and international resource: Stanford is
looked upon to provide teaching, research, and public
service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to
demands and assumes responsibilities that are national,
indeed worldwide, in character.
Influences on Land Use Policy
Academic
The availability of an 8,100 acre "campus" places
Stanford University in a unique position among Ameri
can universities. Of the major research institutions, only
a few, including Stanford, still offer some breathing
space. Most take on the character of dense urban devel
opments with precious, internal campus open space grad

ually being consumed by necessary physical expansion.
The physical character of Stanford sets it aside as a
special kind of place-all the result of a generous land
endowment and farsighted planning in the use of that
land for both academic and other purposes related to the
institution. ,
As higher education has become more competitive
both within the private sector and with public systems,
this special quality of Stanford has become a unique
asset. Its preservation is essential to the University's
long-run health.
Both Frederick Law Olmsted and MIT President
Francis A. Walker, who assisted Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in developing the original campus plan, envisioned a
residential community of scholars, with students in small
living groups located in close proximity to faculty and
academic facilities. That original concept still prevails, in
principle, because the availability of land has permitted
it to be retained in spite of the dramatic changes and
growth which have taken place within the institution.
The community which exists, imperfect though it may
be, still helps to minimize the impersonal elements of a
large institution, and provides an environment which
permits and encourages a high degree of interaction
between faculty and students in a variety of situations.
This is a critical element in the educational process and
one which must be retained in an increasingly imper
sonal society. While the present student and faculty
residence system approaches adequacy lor the size of
institution now envisioned, future generations of edu
cators may find it desirable to expand the size ot the
student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be
preserved to provide for organized and independent re
creational opportunities for faculty, staff, and students
who reside here.
Since World War 11 Stanford has emerged as a major
research institution—a fact which has not only changed
its character but has generated great demands for a
variety of facilities. Its ability to respond to those de
mands was a key element undergirding its research
eminence in science, engineering, and medicine.
One need consider only a few changes which have
taken place over the short span of 1 5 years—the Medical
Center, the linear accelerator, astrophysics, the biologi
cal preserve—to appreciate how difficult it is to predict
the needs and demands of future generations and how
important is the capacity to respond to them. Clearly
the availability of land will have a strong influence bn
the future of Stanford, both as a teaching and as a
research institution, and it is imperative that multiple
options be retained. While other institutions are being
forced ,to purchase adjacent properties (at high prices
and often at the expense of community goodwill) or to
locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he
ability of scholars to exchange knowledge and k to
transfer research from campus laboratories to comnfer
cial applications provides a variety of benefits to faculty,
to graduate students, and to the greater society. On the
other hand, the use of presently undeveloped lands by
organizations or for purposes which do not have a strong
bond with the research and teaching functions is deemed
contrary to the long-term interests of the University and
the larger society it serves.
Financial Considerations
In the 1950s Stanford began to develop a limited
portion of its lands for interim income-producing pur
poses. In addition to the direct and indirect academic
benefits there were and still are important financial
reasons for this: 1) the increasing burden of property
taxes on undeveloped lands and 2) the view that the land
represents a financial resource imposing a fiduciary
obligation to obtain economic returns on those portions
not currently used for academic functions.
The first pressure is quite real. Property held by a
tax-exempt institution but not used for tax-exempt pur
poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while
at the same time providing incremental income to the
University. •
Efforts have been made to find agricultural uses
which would cover the carrying costs ot the property
and reduce the pressures for development. However,
income from those sources has not proven to be an
adequate offset for rising taxes. Similarly, efforts made
within the State Legislature for changes in the Land
Conservation Act to permit automatic withdrawal from
contractual open-space restrictions for academic uses
have been unsuccessful. Recent explorations with
governmental officials have indicated that certain forms
of open space or scenic easement contracts might be
devised which would permit cancellation when the land
is required for academic purposes. Under such contracts,
tax appraisals would be based upon the actual income
produced by permitted uses rather than the highest and
best use for the land. To the extent that long-term
academic flexibility can be retained at a minimal cost to
general funds, this approach would eliminate one of the
principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.

and residence teaching facilities. From its inception, the
physical plans for Stanford have contemplated that stu
dents and faculty would, to the extent possible, live in
close proximity to each other and to their teaching and
research facilities.
2. A research institution: The hallmark of a distin
guished university is the interaction between teaching
and research. The vitality of teaching depends on the
advancement of knowledge through original research,
and scholarship is kept alive through the training of
young and lively minds. Furthermore, if research is to be
more than a sterile exercise, those who engage in it
require the opportunity for close interaction with public
and private sponsors and with users of research as well.
3. A dynamic institution: Universities are by nature
conservative institutions in the sense that they are
charged with conserving and teaching the best of man's
past learning. But they are also by their nature engaged
in change, both adjusting to the changing world around
them and providing the intellectual stimulus for the
forces which will produce change.
4. A private institution: Stanford was founded and
organized as a private trust, and its on-going financial
support and operations are derived primarily from pri
vate sources—tuition, gifts, and endowment. While Stan
ford receives public monies in return for specific serv
ices, its ability to remain an independent, self-determi
ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.
6. A national and international resource: Stanford is
looked upon to provide teaching, research, and public
service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to
demands and assumes responsibilities that are national,
indeed worldwide, in character.
Influences on Land Use Policy
Academic
The availability of an 8,100 acre "campus" places
Stanford University in a unique position among Ameri
can universities. Of the major research institutions, only
a few, including Stanford, still offer some breathing
space. Most take on the character of dense urban devel
opments with precious, internal campus open space grad

ually being consumed by necessary physical expansion.
The physical character of Stanford sets it aside as a
special kind of place-all the result of a generous land
endowment and farsighted planning in the use of that
land for both academic and other purposes related to the
institution. ,
As higher education has become more competitive
both within the private sector and with public systems,
this special quality of Stanford has become a unique
asset. Its preservation is essential to the University's
long-run health.
Both Frederick Law Olmsted and MIT President
Francis A. Walker, who assisted Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in developing the original campus plan, envisioned a
residential community of scholars, with students in small
living groups located in close proximity to faculty and
academic facilities. That original concept still prevails, in
principle, because the availability of land has permitted
it to be retained in spite of the dramatic changes and
growth which have taken place within the institution.
The community which exists, imperfect though it may
be, still helps to minimize the impersonal elements of a
large institution, and provides an environment which
permits and encourages a high degree of interaction
between faculty and students in a variety of situations.
This is a critical element in the educational process and
one which must be retained in an increasingly imper
sonal society. While the present student and faculty
residence system approaches adequacy lor the size of
institution now envisioned, future generations of edu
cators may find it desirable to expand the size ot the
student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be
preserved to provide for organized and independent re
creational opportunities for faculty, staff, and students
who reside here.
Since World War 11 Stanford has emerged as a major
research institution—a fact which has not only changed
its character but has generated great demands for a
variety of facilities. Its ability to respond to those de
mands was a key element undergirding its research
eminence in science, engineering, and medicine.
One need consider only a few changes which have
taken place over the short span of 1 5 years—the Medical
Center, the linear accelerator, astrophysics, the biologi
cal preserve—to appreciate how difficult it is to predict
the needs and demands of future generations and how
important is the capacity to respond to them. Clearly
the availability of land will have a strong influence bn
the future of Stanford, both as a teaching and as a
research institution, and it is imperative that multiple
options be retained. While other institutions are being
forced ,to purchase adjacent properties (at high prices
and often at the expense of community goodwill) or to
locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he
ability of scholars to exchange knowledge and k to
transfer research from campus laboratories to comnfer
cial applications provides a variety of benefits to faculty,
to graduate students, and to the greater society. On the
other hand, the use of presently undeveloped lands by
organizations or for purposes which do not have a strong
bond with the research and teaching functions is deemed
contrary to the long-term interests of the University and
the larger society it serves.
Financial Considerations
In the 1950s Stanford began to develop a limited
portion of its lands for interim income-producing pur
poses. In addition to the direct and indirect academic
benefits there were and still are important financial
reasons for this: 1) the increasing burden of property
taxes on undeveloped lands and 2) the view that the land
represents a financial resource imposing a fiduciary
obligation to obtain economic returns on those portions
not currently used for academic functions.
The first pressure is quite real. Property held by a
tax-exempt institution but not used for tax-exempt pur
poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while
at the same time providing incremental income to the
University. •
Efforts have been made to find agricultural uses
which would cover the carrying costs ot the property
and reduce the pressures for development. However,
income from those sources has not proven to be an
adequate offset for rising taxes. Similarly, efforts made
within the State Legislature for changes in the Land
Conservation Act to permit automatic withdrawal from
contractual open-space restrictions for academic uses
have been unsuccessful. Recent explorations with
governmental officials have indicated that certain forms
of open space or scenic easement contracts might be
devised which would permit cancellation when the land
is required for academic purposes. Under such contracts,
tax appraisals would be based upon the actual income
produced by permitted uses rather than the highest and
best use for the land. To the extent that long-term
academic flexibility can be retained at a minimal cost to
general funds, this approach would eliminate one of the
principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.

Following is the draft text of a statement on Stanford
land use and proposed land use policies, prepared by
Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger and discussed with
the Imnd and Building Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees Jan. 8.
Copies have been given the University Committee on
Land and Building Development for their consideration
and comment and also are being made available to local
government officials prior to any trustee action. Hope
fully, the University Committee will be prepared to
report on the proposed statement and policies by the
March 12 Board of Trustees meeting.
At this time, when various governmental bodies are in
the process of developing long-range comprehensive
plans for their respective jurisdictions, it appears appro
priate that the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
review and restate the principles and policies that govern
the use of the University's lands in Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, consisting of approximately 8,100
acres. This position paper is intended to provide the
background for these policy decisions.

ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.
6. A national and international resource: Stanford is
looked upon to provide teaching, research, and public
service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to
demands and assumes responsibilities that are national,
indeed worldwide, in character.
Influences on Land Use Policy
Academic
The availability of an 8,100 acre "campus" places
Stanford University in a unique position among Ameri
can universities. Of the major research institutions, only
a few, including Stanford, still offer some breathing
space. Most take on the character of dense urban devel
opments with precious, internal campus open space grad

ually being consumed by necessary physical expansion.
The physical character of Stanford sets it aside as a
special kind of place-all the result of a generous land
endowment and farsighted planning in the use of that
land for both academic and other purposes related to the
institution. ,
As higher education has become more competitive
both within the private sector and with public systems,
this special quality of Stanford has become a unique
asset. Its preservation is essential to the University's
long-run health.
Both Frederick Law Olmsted and MIT President
Francis A. Walker, who assisted Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in developing the original campus plan, envisioned a
residential community of scholars, with students in small
living groups located in close proximity to faculty and
academic facilities. That original concept still prevails, in
principle, because the availability of land has permitted
it to be retained in spite of the dramatic changes and
growth which have taken place within the institution.
The community which exists, imperfect though it may
be, still helps to minimize the impersonal elements of a
large institution, and provides an environment which
permits and encourages a high degree of interaction
between faculty and students in a variety of situations.
This is a critical element in the educational process and
one which must be retained in an increasingly imper
sonal society. While the present student and faculty
residence system approaches adequacy lor the size of
institution now envisioned, future generations of edu
cators may find it desirable to expand the size ot the
student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be
preserved to provide for organized and independent re
creational opportunities for faculty, staff, and students
who reside here.
Since World War 11 Stanford has emerged as a major
research institution—a fact which has not only changed
its character but has generated great demands for a
variety of facilities. Its ability to respond to those de
mands was a key element undergirding its research
eminence in science, engineering, and medicine.
One need consider only a few changes which have
taken place over the short span of 1 5 years—the Medical
Center, the linear accelerator, astrophysics, the biologi
cal preserve—to appreciate how difficult it is to predict
the needs and demands of future generations and how
important is the capacity to respond to them. Clearly
the availability of land will have a strong influence bn
the future of Stanford, both as a teaching and as a
research institution, and it is imperative that multiple
options be retained. While other institutions are being
forced ,to purchase adjacent properties (at high prices
and often at the expense of community goodwill) or to
locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he
ability of scholars to exchange knowledge and k to
transfer research from campus laboratories to comnfer
cial applications provides a variety of benefits to faculty,
to graduate students, and to the greater society. On the
other hand, the use of presently undeveloped lands by
organizations or for purposes which do not have a strong
bond with the research and teaching functions is deemed
contrary to the long-term interests of the University and
the larger society it serves.
Financial Considerations
In the 1950s Stanford began to develop a limited
portion of its lands for interim income-producing pur
poses. In addition to the direct and indirect academic
benefits there were and still are important financial
reasons for this: 1) the increasing burden of property
taxes on undeveloped lands and 2) the view that the land
represents a financial resource imposing a fiduciary
obligation to obtain economic returns on those portions
not currently used for academic functions.
The first pressure is quite real. Property held by a
tax-exempt institution but not used for tax-exempt pur
poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while
at the same time providing incremental income to the
University. •
Efforts have been made to find agricultural uses
which would cover the carrying costs ot the property
and reduce the pressures for development. However,
income from those sources has not proven to be an
adequate offset for rising taxes. Similarly, efforts made
within the State Legislature for changes in the Land
Conservation Act to permit automatic withdrawal from
contractual open-space restrictions for academic uses
have been unsuccessful. Recent explorations with
governmental officials have indicated that certain forms
of open space or scenic easement contracts might be
devised which would permit cancellation when the land
is required for academic purposes. Under such contracts,
tax appraisals would be based upon the actual income
produced by permitted uses rather than the highest and
best use for the land. To the extent that long-term
academic flexibility can be retained at a minimal cost to
general funds, this approach would eliminate one of the
principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.

Following is the draft text of a statement on Stanford
land use and proposed land use policies, prepared by
Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger and discussed with
the Imnd and Building Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees Jan. 8.
Copies have been given the University Committee on
Land and Building Development for their consideration
and comment and also are being made available to local
government officials prior to any trustee action. Hope
fully, the University Committee will be prepared to
report on the proposed statement and policies by the
March 12 Board of Trustees meeting.
At this time, when various governmental bodies are in
the process of developing long-range comprehensive
plans for their respective jurisdictions, it appears appro
priate that the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
review and restate the principles and policies that govern
the use of the University's lands in Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, consisting of approximately 8,100
acres. This position paper is intended to provide the
background for these policy decisions.
Characteristics of Stanford University
Any determination of land use is dependent upon an
understanding of the characteristics and purposes of the
institution. Stanford University is:
1. A residential university: The educational process,
particularly at the undergraduate level, is based upon a
close interrelationship of classroom, laboratory, library
and residence teaching facilities. From its inception, the
physical plans for Stanford have contemplated that stu
dents and faculty would, to the extent possible, live in
close proximity to each other and to their teaching and
research facilities.
2. A research institution: The hallmark of a distin
guished university is the interaction between teaching
and research. The vitality of teaching depends on the
advancement of knowledge through original research,
and scholarship is kept alive through the training of
young and lively minds. Furthermore, if research is to be
more than a sterile exercise, those who engage in it
require the opportunity for close interaction with public
and private sponsors and with users of research as well.
3. A dynamic institution: Universities are by nature
conservative institutions in the sense that they are
charged with conserving and teaching the best of man's
past learning. But they are also by their nature engaged
in change, both adjusting to the changing world around
them and providing the intellectual stimulus for the
forces which will produce change.
4. A private institution: Stanford was founded and
organized as a private trust, and its on-going financial
support and operations are derived primarily from pri
vate sources—tuition, gifts, and endowment. While Stan
ford receives public monies in return for specific serv
ices, its ability to remain an independent, self-determi
ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.

service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to

endowment and farsighted planning in the use of that
land for both academic and other purposes related to the
institution. ,
As higher education has become more competitive
both within the private sector and with public systems,
this special quality of Stanford has become a unique
asset. Its preservation is essential to the University's
long-run health.
Both Frederick Law Olmsted and MIT President
Francis A. Walker, who assisted Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in developing the original campus plan, envisioned a
residential community of scholars, with students in small
living groups located in close proximity to faculty and
academic facilities. That original concept still prevails, in
principle, because the availability of land has permitted
it to be retained in spite of the dramatic changes and
growth which have taken place within the institution.
The community which exists, imperfect though it may
be, still helps to minimize the impersonal elements of a
large institution, and provides an environment which
permits and encourages a high degree of interaction
between faculty and students in a variety of situations.
This is a critical element in the educational process and
one which must be retained in an increasingly imper
sonal society. While the present student and faculty
residence system approaches adequacy lor the size of
institution now envisioned, future generations of edu
cators may find it desirable to expand the size ot the
student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be
preserved to provide for organized and independent re
creational opportunities for faculty, staff, and students
who reside here.
Since World War 11 Stanford has emerged as a major
research institution—a fact which has not only changed
its character but has generated great demands for a
variety of facilities. Its ability to respond to those de
mands was a key element undergirding its research
eminence in science, engineering, and medicine.
One need consider only a few changes which have
taken place over the short span of 1 5 years—the Medical
Center, the linear accelerator, astrophysics, the biologi
cal preserve—to appreciate how difficult it is to predict
the needs and demands of future generations and how
important is the capacity to respond to them. Clearly
the availability of land will have a strong influence bn
the future of Stanford, both as a teaching and as a
research institution, and it is imperative that multiple
options be retained. While other institutions are being
forced ,to purchase adjacent properties (at high prices
and often at the expense of community goodwill) or to
locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he
ability of scholars to exchange knowledge and k to
transfer research from campus laboratories to comnfer
cial applications provides a variety of benefits to faculty,
to graduate students, and to the greater society. On the
other hand, the use of presently undeveloped lands by
organizations or for purposes which do not have a strong
bond with the research and teaching functions is deemed
contrary to the long-term interests of the University and
the larger society it serves.
Financial Considerations
In the 1950s Stanford began to develop a limited
portion of its lands for interim income-producing pur
poses. In addition to the direct and indirect academic
benefits there were and still are important financial
reasons for this: 1) the increasing burden of property
taxes on undeveloped lands and 2) the view that the land
represents a financial resource imposing a fiduciary
obligation to obtain economic returns on those portions
not currently used for academic functions.
The first pressure is quite real. Property held by a
tax-exempt institution but not used for tax-exempt pur
poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while
at the same time providing incremental income to the
University. •
Efforts have been made to find agricultural uses
which would cover the carrying costs ot the property
and reduce the pressures for development. However,
income from those sources has not proven to be an
adequate offset for rising taxes. Similarly, efforts made
within the State Legislature for changes in the Land
Conservation Act to permit automatic withdrawal from
contractual open-space restrictions for academic uses
have been unsuccessful. Recent explorations with
governmental officials have indicated that certain forms
of open space or scenic easement contracts might be
devised which would permit cancellation when the land
is required for academic purposes. Under such contracts,
tax appraisals would be based upon the actual income
produced by permitted uses rather than the highest and
best use for the land. To the extent that long-term
academic flexibility can be retained at a minimal cost to
general funds, this approach would eliminate one of the
principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.

Following is the draft text of a statement on Stanford
land use and proposed land use policies, prepared by
Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger and discussed with
the Imnd and Building Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees Jan. 8.
Copies have been given the University Committee on
Land and Building Development for their consideration
and comment and also are being made available to local
government officials prior to any trustee action. Hope
fully, the University Committee will be prepared to
report on the proposed statement and policies by the
March 12 Board of Trustees meeting.
At this time, when various governmental bodies are in
the process of developing long-range comprehensive
plans for their respective jurisdictions, it appears appro
priate that the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
review and restate the principles and policies that govern
the use of the University's lands in Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, consisting of approximately 8,100
acres. This position paper is intended to provide the
background for these policy decisions.
Characteristics of Stanford University
Any determination of land use is dependent upon an
understanding of the characteristics and purposes of the
institution. Stanford University is:
1. A residential university: The educational process,
particularly at the undergraduate level, is based upon a
close interrelationship of classroom, laboratory, library
and residence teaching facilities. From its inception, the
physical plans for Stanford have contemplated that stu
dents and faculty would, to the extent possible, live in
close proximity to each other and to their teaching and
research facilities.
2. A research institution: The hallmark of a distin
guished university is the interaction between teaching
and research. The vitality of teaching depends on the
advancement of knowledge through original research,
and scholarship is kept alive through the training of
young and lively minds. Furthermore, if research is to be
more than a sterile exercise, those who engage in it
require the opportunity for close interaction with public
and private sponsors and with users of research as well.
3. A dynamic institution: Universities are by nature
conservative institutions in the sense that they are
charged with conserving and teaching the best of man's
past learning. But they are also by their nature engaged
in change, both adjusting to the changing world around
them and providing the intellectual stimulus for the
forces which will produce change.
4. A private institution: Stanford was founded and
organized as a private trust, and its on-going financial
support and operations are derived primarily from pri
vate sources—tuition, gifts, and endowment. While Stan
ford receives public monies in return for specific serv
ices, its ability to remain an independent, self-determi
ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.
6. A national and international resource: Stanford is
looked upon to provide teaching, research, and public
service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to
demands and assumes responsibilities that are national,
indeed worldwide, in character.
Influences on Land Use Policy
Academic
The availability of an 8,100 acre "campus" places
Stanford University in a unique position among Ameri
can universities. Of the major research institutions, only
a few, including Stanford, still offer some breathing
space. Most take on the character of dense urban devel
opments with precious, internal campus open space grad

ually being consumed by necessary physical expansion.
The physical character of Stanford sets it aside as a
special kind of place-all the result of a generous land

student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be
preserved to provide for organized and independent re
creational opportunities for faculty, staff, and students
who reside here.
Since World War 11 Stanford has emerged as a major
research institution—a fact which has not only changed
its character but has generated great demands for a
variety of facilities. Its ability to respond to those de
mands was a key element undergirding its research
eminence in science, engineering, and medicine.
One need consider only a few changes which have
taken place over the short span of 1 5 years—the Medical
Center, the linear accelerator, astrophysics, the biologi
cal preserve—to appreciate how difficult it is to predict
the needs and demands of future generations and how
important is the capacity to respond to them. Clearly
the availability of land will have a strong influence bn
the future of Stanford, both as a teaching and as a
research institution, and it is imperative that multiple
options be retained. While other institutions are being
forced ,to purchase adjacent properties (at high prices
and often at the expense of community goodwill) or to
locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he
ability of scholars to exchange knowledge and k to
transfer research from campus laboratories to comnfer
cial applications provides a variety of benefits to faculty,
to graduate students, and to the greater society. On the
other hand, the use of presently undeveloped lands by
organizations or for purposes which do not have a strong
bond with the research and teaching functions is deemed
contrary to the long-term interests of the University and
the larger society it serves.
Financial Considerations
In the 1950s Stanford began to develop a limited
portion of its lands for interim income-producing pur
poses. In addition to the direct and indirect academic
benefits there were and still are important financial
reasons for this: 1) the increasing burden of property
taxes on undeveloped lands and 2) the view that the land
represents a financial resource imposing a fiduciary
obligation to obtain economic returns on those portions
not currently used for academic functions.
The first pressure is quite real. Property held by a
tax-exempt institution but not used for tax-exempt pur
poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while
at the same time providing incremental income to the
University. •
Efforts have been made to find agricultural uses
which would cover the carrying costs ot the property
and reduce the pressures for development. However,
income from those sources has not proven to be an
adequate offset for rising taxes. Similarly, efforts made
within the State Legislature for changes in the Land
Conservation Act to permit automatic withdrawal from
contractual open-space restrictions for academic uses
have been unsuccessful. Recent explorations with
governmental officials have indicated that certain forms
of open space or scenic easement contracts might be
devised which would permit cancellation when the land
is required for academic purposes. Under such contracts,
tax appraisals would be based upon the actual income
produced by permitted uses rather than the highest and
best use for the land. To the extent that long-term
academic flexibility can be retained at a minimal cost to
general funds, this approach would eliminate one of the
principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.

Following is the draft text of a statement on Stanford
land use and proposed land use policies, prepared by
Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger and discussed with
the Imnd and Building Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees Jan. 8.
Copies have been given the University Committee on
Land and Building Development for their consideration
and comment and also are being made available to local
government officials prior to any trustee action. Hope
fully, the University Committee will be prepared to
report on the proposed statement and policies by the
March 12 Board of Trustees meeting.
At this time, when various governmental bodies are in
the process of developing long-range comprehensive
plans for their respective jurisdictions, it appears appro
priate that the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
review and restate the principles and policies that govern
the use of the University's lands in Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, consisting of approximately 8,100
acres. This position paper is intended to provide the
background for these policy decisions.
Characteristics of Stanford University
Any determination of land use is dependent upon an
understanding of the characteristics and purposes of the
institution. Stanford University is:
1. A residential university: The educational process,
particularly at the undergraduate level, is based upon a
close interrelationship of classroom, laboratory, library
and residence teaching facilities. From its inception, the
physical plans for Stanford have contemplated that stu
dents and faculty would, to the extent possible, live in
close proximity to each other and to their teaching and
research facilities.
2. A research institution: The hallmark of a distin
guished university is the interaction between teaching
and research. The vitality of teaching depends on the
advancement of knowledge through original research,
and scholarship is kept alive through the training of
young and lively minds. Furthermore, if research is to be
more than a sterile exercise, those who engage in it
require the opportunity for close interaction with public
and private sponsors and with users of research as well.
3. A dynamic institution: Universities are by nature
conservative institutions in the sense that they are
charged with conserving and teaching the best of man's
past learning. But they are also by their nature engaged
in change, both adjusting to the changing world around
them and providing the intellectual stimulus for the
forces which will produce change.
4. A private institution: Stanford was founded and
organized as a private trust, and its on-going financial
support and operations are derived primarily from pri
vate sources—tuition, gifts, and endowment. While Stan
ford receives public monies in return for specific serv
ices, its ability to remain an independent, self-determi
ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.
6. A national and international resource: Stanford is
looked upon to provide teaching, research, and public
service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to
demands and assumes responsibilities that are national,
indeed worldwide, in character.
Influences on Land Use Policy
Academic
The availability of an 8,100 acre "campus" places
Stanford University in a unique position among Ameri
can universities. Of the major research institutions, only
a few, including Stanford, still offer some breathing
space. Most take on the character of dense urban devel
opments with precious, internal campus open space grad

ually being consumed by necessary physical expansion.
The physical character of Stanford sets it aside as a
special kind of place-all the result of a generous land
endowment and farsighted planning in the use of that
land for both academic and other purposes related to the
institution. ,
As higher education has become more competitive
both within the private sector and with public systems,
this special quality of Stanford has become a unique
asset. Its preservation is essential to the University's
long-run health.
Both Frederick Law Olmsted and MIT President
Francis A. Walker, who assisted Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in developing the original campus plan, envisioned a
residential community of scholars, with students in small
living groups located in close proximity to faculty and
academic facilities. That original concept still prevails, in
principle, because the availability of land has permitted
it to be retained in spite of the dramatic changes and
growth which have taken place within the institution.
The community which exists, imperfect though it may
be, still helps to minimize the impersonal elements of a
large institution, and provides an environment which
permits and encourages a high degree of interaction
between faculty and students in a variety of situations.
This is a critical element in the educational process and
one which must be retained in an increasingly imper
sonal society. While the present student and faculty
residence system approaches adequacy lor the size of
institution now envisioned, future generations of edu
cators may find it desirable to expand the size ot the
student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be

locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he
ability of scholars to exchange knowledge and k to
transfer research from campus laboratories to comnfer
cial applications provides a variety of benefits to faculty,
to graduate students, and to the greater society. On the
other hand, the use of presently undeveloped lands by
organizations or for purposes which do not have a strong
bond with the research and teaching functions is deemed
contrary to the long-term interests of the University and
the larger society it serves.
Financial Considerations
In the 1950s Stanford began to develop a limited
portion of its lands for interim income-producing pur
poses. In addition to the direct and indirect academic
benefits there were and still are important financial
reasons for this: 1) the increasing burden of property
taxes on undeveloped lands and 2) the view that the land
represents a financial resource imposing a fiduciary
obligation to obtain economic returns on those portions
not currently used for academic functions.
The first pressure is quite real. Property held by a
tax-exempt institution but not used for tax-exempt pur
poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while
at the same time providing incremental income to the
University. •
Efforts have been made to find agricultural uses
which would cover the carrying costs ot the property
and reduce the pressures for development. However,
income from those sources has not proven to be an
adequate offset for rising taxes. Similarly, efforts made
within the State Legislature for changes in the Land
Conservation Act to permit automatic withdrawal from
contractual open-space restrictions for academic uses
have been unsuccessful. Recent explorations with
governmental officials have indicated that certain forms
of open space or scenic easement contracts might be
devised which would permit cancellation when the land
is required for academic purposes. Under such contracts,
tax appraisals would be based upon the actual income
produced by permitted uses rather than the highest and
best use for the land. To the extent that long-term
academic flexibility can be retained at a minimal cost to
general funds, this approach would eliminate one of the
principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.

Following is the draft text of a statement on Stanford
land use and proposed land use policies, prepared by
Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger and discussed with
the Imnd and Building Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees Jan. 8.
Copies have been given the University Committee on
Land and Building Development for their consideration
and comment and also are being made available to local
government officials prior to any trustee action. Hope
fully, the University Committee will be prepared to
report on the proposed statement and policies by the
March 12 Board of Trustees meeting.
At this time, when various governmental bodies are in
the process of developing long-range comprehensive
plans for their respective jurisdictions, it appears appro
priate that the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
review and restate the principles and policies that govern
the use of the University's lands in Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, consisting of approximately 8,100
acres. This position paper is intended to provide the
background for these policy decisions.
Characteristics of Stanford University
Any determination of land use is dependent upon an
understanding of the characteristics and purposes of the
institution. Stanford University is:
1. A residential university: The educational process,
particularly at the undergraduate level, is based upon a
close interrelationship of classroom, laboratory, library
and residence teaching facilities. From its inception, the
physical plans for Stanford have contemplated that stu
dents and faculty would, to the extent possible, live in
close proximity to each other and to their teaching and
research facilities.
2. A research institution: The hallmark of a distin
guished university is the interaction between teaching
and research. The vitality of teaching depends on the
advancement of knowledge through original research,
and scholarship is kept alive through the training of
young and lively minds. Furthermore, if research is to be
more than a sterile exercise, those who engage in it
require the opportunity for close interaction with public
and private sponsors and with users of research as well.
3. A dynamic institution: Universities are by nature
conservative institutions in the sense that they are
charged with conserving and teaching the best of man's
past learning. But they are also by their nature engaged
in change, both adjusting to the changing world around
them and providing the intellectual stimulus for the
forces which will produce change.
4. A private institution: Stanford was founded and
organized as a private trust, and its on-going financial
support and operations are derived primarily from pri
vate sources—tuition, gifts, and endowment. While Stan
ford receives public monies in return for specific serv
ices, its ability to remain an independent, self-determi
ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.
6. A national and international resource: Stanford is
looked upon to provide teaching, research, and public
service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to
demands and assumes responsibilities that are national,
indeed worldwide, in character.
Influences on Land Use Policy
Academic
The availability of an 8,100 acre "campus" places
Stanford University in a unique position among Ameri
can universities. Of the major research institutions, only
a few, including Stanford, still offer some breathing
space. Most take on the character of dense urban devel
opments with precious, internal campus open space grad

ually being consumed by necessary physical expansion.
The physical character of Stanford sets it aside as a
special kind of place-all the result of a generous land
endowment and farsighted planning in the use of that
land for both academic and other purposes related to the
institution. ,
As higher education has become more competitive
both within the private sector and with public systems,
this special quality of Stanford has become a unique
asset. Its preservation is essential to the University's
long-run health.
Both Frederick Law Olmsted and MIT President
Francis A. Walker, who assisted Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in developing the original campus plan, envisioned a
residential community of scholars, with students in small
living groups located in close proximity to faculty and
academic facilities. That original concept still prevails, in
principle, because the availability of land has permitted
it to be retained in spite of the dramatic changes and
growth which have taken place within the institution.
The community which exists, imperfect though it may
be, still helps to minimize the impersonal elements of a
large institution, and provides an environment which
permits and encourages a high degree of interaction
between faculty and students in a variety of situations.
This is a critical element in the educational process and
one which must be retained in an increasingly imper
sonal society. While the present student and faculty
residence system approaches adequacy lor the size of
institution now envisioned, future generations of edu
cators may find it desirable to expand the size ot the
student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be
preserved to provide for organized and independent re
creational opportunities for faculty, staff, and students
who reside here.
Since World War 11 Stanford has emerged as a major
research institution—a fact which has not only changed
its character but has generated great demands for a
variety of facilities. Its ability to respond to those de
mands was a key element undergirding its research
eminence in science, engineering, and medicine.
One need consider only a few changes which have
taken place over the short span of 1 5 years—the Medical
Center, the linear accelerator, astrophysics, the biologi
cal preserve—to appreciate how difficult it is to predict
the needs and demands of future generations and how
important is the capacity to respond to them. Clearly
the availability of land will have a strong influence bn
the future of Stanford, both as a teaching and as a
research institution, and it is imperative that multiple
options be retained. While other institutions are being
forced ,to purchase adjacent properties (at high prices
and often at the expense of community goodwill) or to
locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he

poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while
at the same time providing incremental income to the
University. •
Efforts have been made to find agricultural uses
which would cover the carrying costs ot the property
and reduce the pressures for development. However,
income from those sources has not proven to be an
adequate offset for rising taxes. Similarly, efforts made
within the State Legislature for changes in the Land
Conservation Act to permit automatic withdrawal from
contractual open-space restrictions for academic uses
have been unsuccessful. Recent explorations with
governmental officials have indicated that certain forms
of open space or scenic easement contracts might be
devised which would permit cancellation when the land
is required for academic purposes. Under such contracts,
tax appraisals would be based upon the actual income
produced by permitted uses rather than the highest and
best use for the land. To the extent that long-term
academic flexibility can be retained at a minimal cost to
general funds, this approach would eliminate one of the
principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.

Following is the draft text of a statement on Stanford
land use and proposed land use policies, prepared by
Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger and discussed with
the Imnd and Building Development Committee of the
Board of Trustees Jan. 8.
Copies have been given the University Committee on
Land and Building Development for their consideration
and comment and also are being made available to local
government officials prior to any trustee action. Hope
fully, the University Committee will be prepared to
report on the proposed statement and policies by the
March 12 Board of Trustees meeting.
At this time, when various governmental bodies are in
the process of developing long-range comprehensive
plans for their respective jurisdictions, it appears appro
priate that the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
review and restate the principles and policies that govern
the use of the University's lands in Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, consisting of approximately 8,100
acres. This position paper is intended to provide the
background for these policy decisions.
Characteristics of Stanford University
Any determination of land use is dependent upon an
understanding of the characteristics and purposes of the
institution. Stanford University is:
1. A residential university: The educational process,
particularly at the undergraduate level, is based upon a
close interrelationship of classroom, laboratory, library
and residence teaching facilities. From its inception, the
physical plans for Stanford have contemplated that stu
dents and faculty would, to the extent possible, live in
close proximity to each other and to their teaching and
research facilities.
2. A research institution: The hallmark of a distin
guished university is the interaction between teaching
and research. The vitality of teaching depends on the
advancement of knowledge through original research,
and scholarship is kept alive through the training of
young and lively minds. Furthermore, if research is to be
more than a sterile exercise, those who engage in it
require the opportunity for close interaction with public
and private sponsors and with users of research as well.
3. A dynamic institution: Universities are by nature
conservative institutions in the sense that they are
charged with conserving and teaching the best of man's
past learning. But they are also by their nature engaged
in change, both adjusting to the changing world around
them and providing the intellectual stimulus for the
forces which will produce change.
4. A private institution: Stanford was founded and
organized as a private trust, and its on-going financial
support and operations are derived primarily from pri
vate sources—tuition, gifts, and endowment. While Stan
ford receives public monies in return for specific serv
ices, its ability to remain an independent, self-determi
ning institution is dependent upon financial strength and
viability.
5. A permanent, perpetual institution: By virtue ot
its Founding Grant, its land endowment, and its plant
investment, Stanford is permanently committed to its
present location. Unlike other institutions or organiza
tions, it cannot readily change its situs. Of equal impor
tance, it is likely to exist in perpetuity. A university's
time horizons are measured in centuries, not decades.
6. A national and international resource: Stanford is
looked upon to provide teaching, research, and public
service to meet needs which know no jurisdictional
boundaries. While the University exists in a particular
place, derives important benefits from its location, and
has responsibilities to its neighbors, it is also subject to
demands and assumes responsibilities that are national,
indeed worldwide, in character.
Influences on Land Use Policy
Academic
The availability of an 8,100 acre "campus" places
Stanford University in a unique position among Ameri
can universities. Of the major research institutions, only
a few, including Stanford, still offer some breathing
space. Most take on the character of dense urban devel
opments with precious, internal campus open space grad

ually being consumed by necessary physical expansion.
The physical character of Stanford sets it aside as a
special kind of place-all the result of a generous land
endowment and farsighted planning in the use of that
land for both academic and other purposes related to the
institution. ,
As higher education has become more competitive
both within the private sector and with public systems,
this special quality of Stanford has become a unique
asset. Its preservation is essential to the University's
long-run health.
Both Frederick Law Olmsted and MIT President
Francis A. Walker, who assisted Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in developing the original campus plan, envisioned a
residential community of scholars, with students in small
living groups located in close proximity to faculty and
academic facilities. That original concept still prevails, in
principle, because the availability of land has permitted
it to be retained in spite of the dramatic changes and
growth which have taken place within the institution.
The community which exists, imperfect though it may
be, still helps to minimize the impersonal elements of a
large institution, and provides an environment which
permits and encourages a high degree of interaction
between faculty and students in a variety of situations.
This is a critical element in the educational process and
one which must be retained in an increasingly imper
sonal society. While the present student and faculty
residence system approaches adequacy lor the size of
institution now envisioned, future generations of edu
cators may find it desirable to expand the size ot the
student body and/or faculty. In planning the use ot
Stanford lands, it is imperative that these future genera
tions be provided with the flexibility which exists today
so that the personal character of the educational process
may be retained. Concurrently, adequate areas must be
preserved to provide for organized and independent re
creational opportunities for faculty, staff, and students
who reside here.
Since World War 11 Stanford has emerged as a major
research institution—a fact which has not only changed
its character but has generated great demands for a
variety of facilities. Its ability to respond to those de
mands was a key element undergirding its research
eminence in science, engineering, and medicine.
One need consider only a few changes which have
taken place over the short span of 1 5 years—the Medical
Center, the linear accelerator, astrophysics, the biologi
cal preserve—to appreciate how difficult it is to predict
the needs and demands of future generations and how
important is the capacity to respond to them. Clearly
the availability of land will have a strong influence bn
the future of Stanford, both as a teaching and as a
research institution, and it is imperative that multiple
options be retained. While other institutions are being
forced ,to purchase adjacent properties (at high prices
and often at the expense of community goodwill) or to
locate activities at sites remote from students and other
faculty, Stanford has the ability to change and grow at
its home campus.
Similarly, the use of some portion of Stanford lands
to house private, high technology companies, indejjrn
dent research institutes, and other educationally related
enterprises has important academic overtones. *he
ability of scholars to exchange knowledge and k to
transfer research from campus laboratories to comnfer
cial applications provides a variety of benefits to faculty,
to graduate students, and to the greater society. On the
other hand, the use of presently undeveloped lands by
organizations or for purposes which do not have a strong
bond with the research and teaching functions is deemed
contrary to the long-term interests of the University and
the larger society it serves.
Financial Considerations
In the 1950s Stanford began to develop a limited
portion of its lands for interim income-producing pur
poses. In addition to the direct and indirect academic
benefits there were and still are important financial
reasons for this: 1) the increasing burden of property
taxes on undeveloped lands and 2) the view that the land
represents a financial resource imposing a fiduciary
obligation to obtain economic returns on those portions
not currently used for academic functions.
The first pressure is quite real. Property held by a
tax-exempt institution but not used for tax-exempt pur
poses is still subject to property tax. Furthermore, tax
appraisals are based upon the highest and best use rather
than on the current income-producing value of the
property. As the areas surrounding Stanford land, parti

cularly those in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, have been
more intensely developed, appraisals and resulting tax
liabilities have increased substantially. Development ot
adjoining University properties has eliminated the
negative flow of general funds for property taxes while

principal financial pressures for development.
The second pressure for development is more com
plex. If the lands are viewed merely as a financial endow
ment—a financial resource—the Trustees have a fiduciary
obligation to obtain a reasonable economic return from
them to support the educational enterprise. However, if
they are viewed as an academic endowment or academic
resource, similar to a building, then the Trustees' obliga
tion is to preserve and protect the property for present
and future academic use.
In practice, both points of view have been accommo
dated to date. The use of maximum term land leases,
initially of 99 years' and more recently of 51 years'
duration, has permitted ultimate control over the land
for academic purposes while providing interim income
producing capability. While development has produced
incremental endowment income, experience has proven
that it carries with it many tangible and intangible costs
to the University. The need to provide supportive com
munity facilities and services can result in 'either addi
tional out-of-pocket costs or loss of additional land.
When the land development program was conceived
in the early 19505, Stanford was a regional university,
seeking to build itself into a major academic institution.
Its financial resources were limited—an endowment of
$40,000,000, with an annual operating budget of
$7,000,000.
Relative to its then needs, the land endowment was
appropriately viewed as a significant financial asset.
Twenty years later, the relative significance of the land
as a financial asset has diminished greatly. Stanford has
been successful in achieving a position of worldwide
distinction, deserving of support on its academic merits.
The amount of money represented by the proceeds from
prepaid leases on unincorporated lands not currently
included in the academic reserve (assuming they could
physically be fully developed at once) would be equiva
lent to a 10 percent increase in the endowment, and the
investment return on that amount would provide an
incremental flow of funds equal to a 10 percent increase
in the tuition rate. However, land represents an irreplace
able resource. Once consumed, it is essentially irretriev
able without incurring substantial political and economic
costs.
While it is appropriate to use a portion of Stanford
lands for non-University organizations and functions
which clearly support, relate to, and reinforce the
teaching and research mission of the University, such
uses should be determined primarily by academic factors
in addition to financial considerations. Further intensive
development of Stanford lands for purposes inconsistent
with the above and solely as a source of funds should be
undertaken only as a last resort, when all other financial
resources have been exhausted and the survival ol the
institution is at stake
Political Considerations
One of the greatest difficulties facing the University
has been that of protecting its land from encroachment
by surrounding public entities. Residents of surrounding
communities, individually and collectively, have looked
to Stanford land as a resource for meeting their own
particular needs. As the pendulum swings, those needs
vary from employment, tax base, housing, community
facilities, permanent open space, roads and highways.

parks and recreational facilities, to utility easements.
With the surrounding areas reaching urban densities and
most of the vacant land already consumed, the "island
of open space" which Stanford represents will become
an even more tempting target for community consump
tion. This prospect is compounded by the very severe
zoning restrictions being used by these communities to
restrict their own growth.
The risk of condemnation is real and continuing.
Some 665 acres have already been condemned for public
purposes, many for a freeway system whose route
traversing the center of Stanford lands was neither
sought nor wanted by the University.
The University, as an institution, is permanently com
mitted to its present location. It must retain the right
responsibly to use its land endowment in the furtherance
of its academic mission, subject only to reasonable re
straints which may be imposed by political jurisdictions.
When public bodies contemplate taking University land
or limiting its uses, it is submitted that they have a
serious obligation to consider in their deliberations the
social consequences of restricting the University's ability
to perform its essential missions, now and in the future.
Some of the negative reactions of surrounding com
munities in recent years are clearly attributable to the
perception that Stanford's presence and its land develop
ment policies have induced growth in the region and
contributed to alleged deterioration of the residential
quality of the area. At a time when anti-development
attitudes are strong, the absence of any clearly defined
policy from Stanford contributes to the fears and suspi
cions of its neighbors.
The use of undeveloped Stanford land for high
density manufacturing or high-density employment cen
ters is deemed inappropriate and not in the best interests
of the University, except where such use has already
been made of certain campus lands. Such activities
adversely affect the local employment market and place
pressures on the University to participate in community
services to accommodate the influx of additional em-
ployment. Conversely, the use of Stanford lands by
private research and development organizations whose
employment is of low density and predominantly profes
sional in character offers few of these problems to the
University and the surrounding communities. More im
portantly, a land use policy which limits eligibility for
location on Stanford lands to those organizations whose
presence would enhance the academic functions of the
University represents a rational extension of the concept
that the land endowment is for academic purposes.
For similar reasons, any significant use of Stanford
lands for non-university related housing seems inappro
priate. Single-family, condominium, cooperative, and, to
a lesser extent, rental housing units present definite
problems from the point of view of recapture because of
the multitude of ownership and possession interests, and
must, in effect, represent a permanent commitment of
the land to housing purposes.
Unlike most other educational institutions which
must obtain municipal services from their local commu
nities even though they do not contribute to the local
tax base, Stanford provides these services for itself. Fire
and police protection, internal road construction and
maintenance, utilities and sewage systems and other
municipal-type services are funded through the operating
budget, and the University places very few financial or
service demands on the counties in which its unincorpor
ated lands are located or the cities adjacent to them.
Furthermore, the interim use of Stanford lands by non
tax-exempt entities has contributed significantly to the
revenues of local political jurisdictions, particularly in
Santa Clara County. Efforts to develop Stanford lands
for incremental tax revenues are not justified and should
be resisted.
Conclusions
The Board of Trustees and University officers have a
right and a duty to preserve and protect Stanford's land
endowment for the use of present and future generations
of students and faculty.
While financial and political influences on land use
policy need to be taken into account, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the appropriateness of
those policies in the furtherance of the academic mission
of the University. Board policies, as adopted from time
to time, should be designed to encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics and pur
poses of Stanford and to discourage those uses or claims
which do not relate to or support the mainstream of the
University.
