# Proposed land use policies
##

needs.
3. Uses of Stanford lands shall continue to produce a
community of which all those who have the welfare of
the University at heart can be proud and shall serve in an
important way as a model in the held ol academic

neighboring jurisdictions shall be considered in the
planning process.
4. All planning within the campus boundaries shall
continue to respect hill tops and ridges of such height
and conformation as to form "skylines" so that insofar
as possible they shall be preserved free from the erection
of structures.
5. Land conservation contracts with governmental
agencies to reduce the University's oronertv tax costs

shall be encouraged provided they permit academic uses
or provide for cancellation or recapture in the event such

6. In order to preserve its land endowment for the
promotion of important public interests in its trust, the
University shall vigorously oppose efforts by public
agencies to condemn its lands.

academic use.

c. The University shall reserve the right to prohib
it any material change in the use of a leasehold or
other property interest.
d. Administrative, professional, research, or indus
