# Whistler Involves Audience
## 
### LAURA PULA 
SAN FRANCISCO—Stepping
through the doorway of the On
Broadway Theatre, one leaves
behind the raucous honky-tonk of
the entertainment district and
enters a cocoon of 19th century
splendor. The crimson carpets, the
chandeliers, and the unobtrusive
music all blend to create an
intimate atmosphere long before
any actors appear on the stage.
Then, suddenly, one is in
London, November 25, 1878, at
The Trial of James McNeill
Whistler.
Those in the audience soon
discover that they are not mere
spectators; they are players in the
drama, members of the jury. The
aura of reality is further enhanced
by using the theatre itself as an
extention of the stage. Dialogue
snaps back and forth from the
rear aisle to the front rows and
then up to the platforms on both
sides. Actors stride into the
spotlight from all directions. The
trial begins.
James Whistler, excellently
palyed by Rudy Solari, is the
now-famous, recalcitrant and
debt-ridden American artist. He is
suing art critic John Ruskin (Drew
Eshelman) for libel, in reference
to reviews calling the artist
"impudent," "ill-educated" and a
"coxcomb," among other things.
Hanging in the balance is a

possible award of one thousand
pounds, desperately needed by
Whistler.
Quick-Witted Prosecutor
The prosecution is handled
well by quick-witted Sergeant
Parry, a character given warmth
and credibility by James Doohan,
perhaps better known as "Scotty"
on Star Trek. Parry's opponent is
the Attorney General, Sir John
Holker, a blustering, theatrical
barrister who is brought to life
powerfully by Jack Aranson.
These three — Whistler, Parry, and
Sir John — are the main focus of
the drama and are involved in a
non-stop verbal sparring match.
The artist, dressed in green silk
and yellow gloves, with his
well-developed ego, does little to
arouse sympathy for his
moneyless plight. At one point, he
answers a query from Sir John
about whether genius was
hereditary with the retort, "I
don't know — heaven has as yet
granted me no offspring."
The dialogue is often
scintillating, and smoothly ironic.
For instance, it is said that Ruskin
is qualified to be an art critic
because he has spent his life
among paintings. To this Whistler
replies that therefore the aging
guards at the museum were
like-wise qualified, and by the
same token a librarian would
necessarily die a poet.
Another time, one of Ruskin's
reviews is read in which he
criticizes Whistler for putting
other colors into a "Symphony in
White." Whistler then merely asks
whether or not a composer, when

intending to call a piece
"Symphony in F" is expected to
use only the one note of F.
Not Without Faults
The Trial of James McNeill
Whistler is not faultless; indeed,
the second act gets rather badly
muddled once or twice. The
humor is occasionally hard to
follow, especially when several
actors are shouting at once.
Further, even allowing for
dramatic license, some of the
lawyer's arguments were not
nearly reasonable or strong
enough to stand up in any real
court.
These criticisms, however, are
all minor in relation to the value
of the whole play. One is almost
always too engrossed in the
dialogue to find fault; the
enthusiastic laughter and the
applause of the audience proved
that point. All in all, The TYial of
James McNeill Whistler is an
enjoyable, stimulating production,
and certainly a worthwhile
addition to San Francisco's
entertainment spectrum.
