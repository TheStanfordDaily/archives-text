### BARBARA HEINS 
The graphic work of Francisco
de Goya is both a mirror of his
reactions to the events of his time
and an exploration into the
recesses of the mind through
depiction of man's dreams, vices
and strivings. In this he is both a
prototype for the modern
Romantic artist, a pioneer of the
grotesque as aesthetic and one of
the first artists to be truly in
touch with his time — the
anxieties, struggles, spirit.
The exhibition of Goya's
etchings, aquatints, and
lithographs now on view at the
Stanford art gallery is the largest
every held in the West. The plates
are of the finest quality and
provide a view of the entire range
of Goya's graphic work, including
several working proofs and
experimental states.
Born in Spain in 1747, Goya
lived the first half of his life
calmly, as the court painter to
Charles 111. The major portion of
his graphic work reflects the
second half lived in an atmosphere
of turbulence created by the
aftermath of the French
Revolution, the Napoleonic
invasion of Spain and civil war.
The deteriation of church and
state power, the struggle of social
classes and the corruption of
culture and morality brought on
by the warfare provided him with
material for his work.
Man And His Weaknesses
The true theme of Goya's
work, however, is Man. Torn
between the supernatural world of
ancient paganism characteristic of
the 18th century and the
"enlightened" Reason of the
19th; and brought face to face
with the horrors of the Inquisition

and war, Goya's Man is also prey
to his own fantasies, vices and
selfishness.
The earliest of Goya's graphic
series, the Capriches, portrays the
suffering and depravities of
contemporary life. The plates are
filled with fantasies, horrors,
follies, eroticism and allusions to
political figures and his mistress,
the Duchess of Alba. Through
these works and the biting
commentary under them, Goya
condemns man in all his sins,

exploitations, corruption,
stupidity and cruelty.
The Disasters of War series
which followed has been called
"the most powerful indictment of
war ever conceived by a great
artist;" and chronicles the horrors
of the Napoleonic invasion.
Decapitated bodies are depicted
impailed on trees, women are
raped and bodies piled up in
mangled and diseased heaps with
inscriptions reading "Was it for
this you were born?" and"It is no
use shouting." A plate labeled the

"Consequences" shows a
human-like bat sucking at the
breast of a man who symbolizes
the Spanish at the hands of the
French.
Final Pessimistic Series
The Proverbs series, left
unfinished, depicts Goya's final
pessimism at the absurdity of life
and the stupidity of man not to
have risen above life's follies. Each
of the other series, The Art of
Bullfighting of 1815 and the rare
lithographic series The Bulls of
Bordeaux, as well as early etchings
after Velasquez are represented
and very clearly documented in
the exhibition.
The exhibition is arranged
chronologically with detailed
descriptions of the aquatint and
lithographic methods used by
Goya to achieve his luminous
shadows, free and open line and
suggestion of color and light.
The exhibition is an exciting
achievement for the Stanford art
community. It includes works on
loan from the Metropolitan
Museum, the National Gallery, the
Art Institute of Chicago, The
Cleveland Museum and the
Achenbach Foundation as well as
private collectors. It is a
comprehensive and scholarly
exhibition which will continue at
the art gallery through March 3.

are of the finest quality and
provide a view of the entire range
of Goya's graphic work, including
several working proofs and
experimental states.
Born in Spain in 1747, Goya
lived the first half of his life
calmly, as the court painter to
Charles 111. The major portion of
his graphic work reflects the
second half lived in an atmosphere
of turbulence created by the
aftermath of the French
Revolution, the Napoleonic
invasion of Spain and civil war.
The deteriation of church and
state power, the struggle of social
classes and the corruption of
culture and morality brought on
by the warfare provided him with
material for his work.
Man And His Weaknesses
The true theme of Goya's
work, however, is Man. Torn
between the supernatural world of
ancient paganism characteristic of
the 18th century and the
"enlightened" Reason of the
19th; and brought face to face
with the horrors of the Inquisition

and war, Goya's Man is also prey
to his own fantasies, vices and
selfishness.
The earliest of Goya's graphic
series, the Capriches, portrays the
suffering and depravities of
contemporary life. The plates are
filled with fantasies, horrors,
follies, eroticism and allusions to
political figures and his mistress,
the Duchess of Alba. Through
these works and the biting
commentary under them, Goya
condemns man in all his sins,

exploitations, corruption,
stupidity and cruelty.
The Disasters of War series
which followed has been called
"the most powerful indictment of
war ever conceived by a great
artist;" and chronicles the horrors
of the Napoleonic invasion.
Decapitated bodies are depicted
impailed on trees, women are
raped and bodies piled up in
mangled and diseased heaps with
inscriptions reading "Was it for
this you were born?" and"It is no
use shouting." A plate labeled the

"Consequences" shows a
human-like bat sucking at the
breast of a man who symbolizes
the Spanish at the hands of the
French.
Final Pessimistic Series
The Proverbs series, left
unfinished, depicts Goya's final
pessimism at the absurdity of life
and the stupidity of man not to
have risen above life's follies. Each
of the other series, The Art of
Bullfighting of 1815 and the rare
lithographic series The Bulls of
Bordeaux, as well as early etchings
after Velasquez are represented
and very clearly documented in
the exhibition.
The exhibition is arranged
chronologically with detailed
descriptions of the aquatint and
lithographic methods used by
Goya to achieve his luminous
shadows, free and open line and
suggestion of color and light.
The exhibition is an exciting
achievement for the Stanford art
community. It includes works on
loan from the Metropolitan
Museum, the National Gallery, the
Art Institute of Chicago, The
Cleveland Museum and the
Achenbach Foundation as well as
private collectors. It is a
comprehensive and scholarly
exhibition which will continue at
the art gallery through March 3.

LITHOGRAPH— The Famous American, Mariano Ceballos is the first of a series of lithographs by
Francisco Goya entitled "The Bulls of Bordeaux." It is included in a comprehensive exhibition of Goya s
graphic work at the Stanford Art Gallery through March 3.
The graphic work of Francisco
de Goya is both a mirror of his
reactions to the events of his time
and an exploration into the
recesses of the mind through
depiction of man's dreams, vices
and strivings. In this he is both a
prototype for the modern
Romantic artist, a pioneer of the
grotesque as aesthetic and one of
the first artists to be truly in
touch with his time — the
anxieties, struggles, spirit.
The exhibition of Goya's
etchings, aquatints, and
lithographs now on view at the
