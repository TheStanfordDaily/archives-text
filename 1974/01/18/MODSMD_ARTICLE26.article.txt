# Malo Succeeds Where Cruz Fails

SAN FRANCISCO—It is
because electric rock music strikes
me as being rather phenomenal in
terms of art that I must preface a
review of Malo's performance last
Friday at the Great American
Music Hall with a few general
observations. Perhaps the single
most noteworthy aspect of
amplified music is its incredible
power and thrust. The audience is
overwhelmed with sound, forced
to listen not with its ears, but
rather with its skin. Electric music
can be extremely superficial for
precisely that reason — that it
captures its audience from the
outside rather than from the
inside; that it is more tactile than
aural.
Electric music is art that is
projected rather than possessed by

the performer. The stereotypic
image is of the artist who is, quite
literally, plugged-in to his or her
art. The image is overworked but
still accurate. It is difficult to
accept an electronic musician as
an artist simply because the art is
more a result of the electronics
than of the musician. This is not
necessarily a criticism of the
artist, but rather an observation
on the ingredients of the product.
The degree of success that a
group in this genre will enjoy
depends upon whether they use
electronics to strengthen the
music, or allow electronics to
weaken it. The performances of
Malo and Pablo Cruz Friday night
illustrated both.
The most prominent feature of
the Pablo Cruz band is its
straight-forwardness.Although the

group competantly performed a
variety of musical styles ranging
from originals and blues to funk
and rock and roll, each showed
the same adherance to sheet
music. Beginning at the beginning
and ending at the end with a

measure of the musicians rather
than the electronics. The original
song, the basic material, is
stretched to the thinnest
recognizable thread by a complex
series of patterns within patterns
and returned, intact, to the

1 Entertainment;

bridge in-between is not
necessarily an uninteresting way
to perform a piece of music. It
can, however, be an unchallenging
one if it is carried off by rote.
On the other hand, excellent
musicians, as Malo demonstrated,
have the ability to carry a piece of
music through the kind of
thematic variation that becomes a

original fabric. The degree to
which a group can let it go before
bringing the piece of music back
home is an index not only of skill
but also of the creative effort
involved in the art of electronic
music.
Malo consists of eight
musicians, most of whom double
on vocals. The group's distinctive

sound is a result primarily of
strong horns and well-blended
percussion. The 'tongas and
timbales, punctuated by the
horns, often set the thematic line
of the music, to which organ,
guitar and vocals add depth and
complexity. Several times during a
number, the horn section can be
seen switching from trumpet or
trombone to percussion
instruments. In a piece like
"Offerings," instruments are
switched almost sequentially to
form an intricate framework of
harmony and rhythm.
MaJo's virtuosity was well
received by Friday night's crowd
at the Great American Music Hall.
Approximately half-full when
Pablo Cruz began his first set, the
house was packed before Malo
reached the stage. Most of those
in the audiencc were familiar with
the cuts from Malo's earlier
records, which were played
mostly in the first set, and all
were receptive to selections from
the newest album. Throughout
the concert, Malo held its
audience not by stage act or talk,
but by the impressive
performance and involvement of
its music.
Although they are not planning
to return to the Great American
Music Hall this month, keep an
eye out for Malo. Wherever they
appear in San Francisco, it will be
a concert worth attending.
This weekend, Cal Tjader will
be at the Great American Music
Hall tonight and tomorrow.
