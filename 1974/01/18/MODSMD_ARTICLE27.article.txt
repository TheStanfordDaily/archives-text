## Company Depth Aids 'Petrified Forest' 
### RALPH COHEN 
BERKELEY—Anyone who has
ever been a drifter will probably
envy Alan Squire, the hero in
Robert Sherwood's play The
Petrified Forest. Vaguely in search
of "America," this remorseful
poetaster happens into a roadside
cafe in Depression-hit Arizona
where he is abruptly bludgeoned
with Americana in some of -its
crudest forms.
These forms include a
star-struck young girl who would
flee to romantic Europe were she
not penniless and duty-bound to
help her family run the cafe, an
old man who helped pioneer the
West and was nearly killed by
Hilly the Kid. and a whole gang of
shoot-em-up desperados with the
law hot on their trail.
This might be material for a
boorish melodrama, but the
Berkeley Repertory Theater,
showing a depth in actors which is
exceptional for a small company,
handles it well.
'An Interesting Fossil'
Terry Wills portrays the lead
character with a sensitivity for the
forlorn and an affectation for
facile eloquence. He is a cogent
human version of the petrified
forest: "Noise without sound.
Shape without purpose ... an
interesting fossil for future
study."
But if Wills' performance is
adept, it is not arresting, and the
magnetism in this production
passes to I lolly Barron, who plays
Gabby, the star-struck girl.
Barron is aided by a raspy
voice and a simple, pretty face
which are reminiscent of
homegrown ruralism. But her
total absorption in Gabby, the
uncultured proprietor's daughter
who swears in one breath and
quotes Francois Villon in the

next, who aspires to visit French
cities whose names she Anglicizes,
is beguiling.
Sympathy Rather Than Pity
Though Wills makes a pitiable
creature, Gabby's plight a dreary
existence in the desert subject to
the advances of all male
passers-by, captures one's
sympathy.
Disillusionment and
romanticism meet in the persons
of Squire and Gabby, and then
separate as Squire departs to
continue his wandering. But
suddenly, Duke Mantee, the
notorious robber-killer played by
Joe Spano, shanghais the car
Squire is hitchhiking in and drives
it back to the cafe. With his gang,
Mantee takes over the cafe and
waits there to rendezvous with his
girlfriend and other gang
members.
Squire lamely returns to the
cafe and is held captive, along
with Gabby and several others, by
Mantee. But under the gun of the
desperado, Squire finds a bizarre
way to vindicate his wasted life
and express his newly found love
for Gabby.
Crusty Humor
Philosophy intrudes in this
play as much as it justifies it, but
the crusty humor interlaced
throughout seems especially apt,
as if to say Americans are most
profound when they don't take
themselves too seriously.
In this line of thought, several
of the minor actors give

entertaining performances. The
most memorable among them are
John Oldham as the crotchety
grandfather of Gabby, who licks
his lips at Mantee's bloody
exploits; Paul Laramore as
Cabby's bumbling father; and
Charles Baron as Mantee's
accomplice Diego, who has a wry
sense of the absurd.
The Petrified Forest was first
performed in 1935 and released as
a movie a year later. Although

Leslie Howard (Ashley in Gone
with the Wind) received most of
the plaudits originally for his part
as Alan Squire, both movie and
play are best remembered for
Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of
the outlaw Duke Mantee.
In spite of its melodramatic
qualities, director Michael Leibert
has produced in The Petrified
Forest a full-bodied play capable
of engrossing today's audiences.

Barron is aided by a raspy
voice and a simple, pretty face
which are reminiscent of
homegrown ruralism. But her
total absorption in Gabby, the
uncultured proprietor's daughter
who swears in one breath and
quotes Francois Villon in the

next, who aspires to visit French
cities whose names she Anglicizes,
is beguiling.
Sympathy Rather Than Pity
Though Wills makes a pitiable
creature, Gabby's plight a dreary
existence in the desert subject to
the advances of all male
passers-by, captures one's
sympathy.
Disillusionment and
romanticism meet in the persons
of Squire and Gabby, and then
separate as Squire departs to
continue his wandering. But
suddenly, Duke Mantee, the
notorious robber-killer played by
Joe Spano, shanghais the car
Squire is hitchhiking in and drives
it back to the cafe. With his gang,
Mantee takes over the cafe and
waits there to rendezvous with his
girlfriend and other gang
members.
Squire lamely returns to the
cafe and is held captive, along
with Gabby and several others, by
Mantee. But under the gun of the
desperado, Squire finds a bizarre
way to vindicate his wasted life
and express his newly found love
for Gabby.
Crusty Humor
Philosophy intrudes in this
play as much as it justifies it, but
the crusty humor interlaced
throughout seems especially apt,
as if to say Americans are most
profound when they don't take
themselves too seriously.
In this line of thought, several
of the minor actors give

entertaining performances. The
most memorable among them are
John Oldham as the crotchety
grandfather of Gabby, who licks
his lips at Mantee's bloody
exploits; Paul Laramore as
Cabby's bumbling father; and
Charles Baron as Mantee's
accomplice Diego, who has a wry
sense of the absurd.
The Petrified Forest was first
performed in 1935 and released as
a movie a year later. Although

Leslie Howard (Ashley in Gone
with the Wind) received most of
the plaudits originally for his part
as Alan Squire, both movie and
play are best remembered for
Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of
the outlaw Duke Mantee.
In spite of its melodramatic
qualities, director Michael Leibert
has produced in The Petrified
Forest a full-bodied play capable
of engrossing today's audiences.
BERKELEY—Anyone who has
ever been a drifter will probably
envy Alan Squire, the hero in
Robert Sherwood's play The
Petrified Forest. Vaguely in search
of "America," this remorseful
poetaster happens into a roadside
cafe in Depression-hit Arizona
where he is abruptly bludgeoned
with Americana in some of -its
crudest forms.
These forms include a
star-struck young girl who would
flee to romantic Europe were she
not penniless and duty-bound to
help her family run the cafe, an
old man who helped pioneer the
West and was nearly killed by
Hilly the Kid. and a whole gang of
shoot-em-up desperados with the
law hot on their trail.
This might be material for a
boorish melodrama, but the
Berkeley Repertory Theater,
showing a depth in actors which is
exceptional for a small company,
handles it well.
'An Interesting Fossil'
Terry Wills portrays the lead
character with a sensitivity for the
forlorn and an affectation for
facile eloquence. He is a cogent
human version of the petrified
forest: "Noise without sound.
Shape without purpose ... an
interesting fossil for future
study."
But if Wills' performance is
adept, it is not arresting, and the
magnetism in this production
passes to I lolly Barron, who plays
Gabby, the star-struck girl.
