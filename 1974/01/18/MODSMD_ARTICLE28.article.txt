## Two Impossibilities 
### Vlae Kershner 
You've probably heard rumors that the Pacific Eight and Big 10
conferences were going to break their exclusive contract with the
Rose Bowl and allow runners-up to go to other bowl games. And
you've definitely heard ear-splitting publicity for an NCAA football
playoff, to once and for all settle the question that ranks with "is
there a God?" — namely "who's number one?"
But there's no cause for alarm (or rejoicing). The Big 10 and Pac-8
aren't going to let either idea become reality. They're too happy with
the status quo.
Let's start with the idea of a national playoff. Pac-8 Commissioner
Wiles Hallock neatly deflates the proposals for such a tourney. 'The
Pac-8 sentiment is overwhelmingly against a national playoff. First, it
threatens our current bowl situation. There's no way a playoff could
do anything but diminish our bowls.
"Second, there are academic objections, time objections .. .there's
no way this could be done in less than a space of several
weeks,"Hallock said.
The leading proponent of a playoff, he says, is not Ara or the Bear
or Joe Paterno, but ABC-TV. "They see a considerable amount of
money in televising the games, so they constantly try to keep the pot
boiling."
I'll go along here. There's enough emphasis on the top teams as it
is. Who wants to see the same old teams and announcers on TV four
more times each year?
Having dismissed that impossibility, let's take a look at the idea of
letting runners-up in the Pac-8 and Big 10 go to bowl games.
Stanford Athletic Director Joe Ruetz does a good job of summing
up the principle arguments that have been raised on both sides.
"Joe Kearney, the AD at Washington, has brought this up a
number of years running. His first argument is that the Rose Bowl
exclusivity contract hurts recruiting at the schools which don't usually
go to the Rose Bowl," since those schools (basically, the Northwest
schools plus Cal) can't use the promise of a bowl game as a lure.
"Second, this puts some pressure on the coaches, since they can be
eliminated early in the season," and have nothing to shoot for.
"And third, he doesn't believe this would hurt the Rose Bowl
contract," since the conference champion would still go to Pasadena.
Ruetz also points out some arguments on the other side. "The
Rose Bowl is the only bowl which has conference champions," he
says. "Also, the Big 10 and Pac-8 are more alike philosophically — in
our concern about abuses to football — than other conferences, and
we wouldn't want to do anything that would hurt the Rose Bowl.
"Third, we'd be getting into the 'bowl jungle,' with bowl people
coming in and talking to our teams in the middle of the season.
"Fourth, if you look at the dollar figure coming out of other
bowls, it's likely that the receipts from teams in those bowls wouldn't
compensate for the loss of revenue from the Rose Bowl television
rights," Ruetz said. Right now, the Rose Bowl has a captive audience
of the great lakes and west coast regions.
And so Stanford, as well as the Los Angeles schools, annually votes
"no" to Kearney's proposal, which this year will be presented at the
Athletic Directors' meeting in May. And the proposal is annually
voted down.
What seems important to me is this. Some Pac-8 schools, even in
their good years, are unable to go to bowl games. UCLA's Blair Pair
never saw a bowl game, even though they led one of the top 10 teams
in the country. Sonny Sixkiller never went to a bowl.
Washington State hasn't been to one since 1930. Think what a shot
in the arm it would have been to that school if its fine 1972 team
could have gone anywhere — even to the Sun or Fiesta Bowls.
There are only three teams in the conference that consistently
draw good crowds — Stanford, USC, and Washington. At the other
five schools, enthusiasm mostly depends on whether the team is any
good or not. Maybe if fans at other schools could hope, every year,
that they'd go to a bowl, there would be bigger crowds, more
enthusiasm.
Logically, the athletic directors in the Pac-8 are right. But if USC
goes to five of the next seven Rose Bowls, as they've done in the last
seven years, the athletic directors may wake up some autumn
Saturday morning to find their Stadiums are empty.
