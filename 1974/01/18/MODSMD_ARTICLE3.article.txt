# Deemphasizes Pre-Professional Training
## Lyman Stresses Broad, Liberal Education 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
University President Richard W.
Lyman last night warned students here
not to emphasize pre-professional
undergraduate training at the cost of a
broad, liberal education.
Speaking before an audience of 450
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Lyman said
that "if ever there was a danger that a
narrowly professional view would
make people insensitive to the needs
of all outside their particular
professional enclosures, there is such a
danger now.
"We are now seeing — not only here
but throughout the country and
indeed much of the world — a marked
revival of all the old disputes over the
respective roles of liberal education
and vocational or professional
training," Lyman noted.
"Most of you are voting with your
feet for vocational and professional
education, as you declare yourselves
pre-meds, or otherwise emphasize
preparation for a career in planning
your choices."
'Serious Dangers'
However, Lyman noted, there are
"serious dangers in the renewed
emphasis on the vocational and
pre-professional side of college
education, even though I recognize the
harsh realities that tend to force it
upon you. If ever the world cried out
for breadth of view and length of
perspective, surely it is now."
Lyman stressed that he was not
discounting the importance of learning
"marketable skills," but asserted that
there is "not much point in becoming
a highly skilled fixer, but totally
without ideas or convictions as to
what needs fixing, or why.
"A few years ago we seemed greatly
oversupplied with amateur rhetoricians
and street-corner moralists; now there
seems a danger of our becoming once
again oversupplied with careerists and
technocrats of one kind or another."
Lyman's speech was billed as a

"State of the University Address," but
in fact he generally stuck to issues of
concern to undergraduates, who
seemed to comprise the bulk of the
audience.
Minority, Female Enrollment
He noted University strides toward
increasing minority and women's
enrollment, pointing out that the
number of minority students has
increased from under 100 in 1965 to
1100 now, and that the percentage of
undergraduate women here is now 39
percent — just one percent lower than
at UC-Berkeley.
Recruitment of minority students,
Lyman said, was "certainly
undertaken consciously, as a matter of
policy. It was done under strong and
coherent pressure from those few
minority students who were already
here, and also, of course, under
pressure from momentous historical
developments and tragic events,
especially the murder of Martin Luther
King.
"Last but not least, it was
undertaken because the University
community and its leaders deeply
believed that a Stanford which did not
include greater numbers of able
minority students was not performing
its proper function, either in respect to
the minorities in question, or to the
rest of the student body."
In women's admissions, Lyman
noted that the number of female
undergraduates has risen by 41 percent
since 1965, compared to a four
percent decline in male
undergraduates. He attributed this
increase to "having removed the
barriers to judging applicants on a
basis of equality," and not to any
active recruitment policy.
However, on the graduate level —
where the male-female ratio is about
3.8 to 1 — "there has been and will be
active recruitment" to increase the
number of women, Lyman said.
Lyman noted that in some ways —

including a popular image as
"something of a bastion of privilege"
— Stanford resembles the Ivy League
schools. But he also noted several
differences, including the fact that
Stanford is much younger than most
of the Ivy League schools, and the
contention that "in a variety of ways,
things are more flexible, less
hidebound, less dominated by
tradition here than they are there."
Lyman frequently returned to the
theme of the quality of undergraduate
education here, stressing the need for
the University to "respond to the
hunger for education unrelated in any
direct sense to career." However, he
cautioned, "The major burden ... will
rest where it has always rested, with
you, the students ....
"The temptation to choose courses

because they meet at 11 o'clock, or
because your roommate's taking it and
you can save on books, or because
someone else is taking it and since
you're spending all the rest of your
waking hours with him/her why not
spend class-time too? — these
temptations stand in the way of
making coherent sense out of your
education," he said.
Responding to a question from
•ASSU President Kevin O'Grady,
Lyman admitted that some survey
results in The Other Stanford — a
recent SWOPSI report examining
undergraduate education, which
concluded that many faculty members
have failed to directly challenge their
students — "sting," but said he didn't
care for some of the "recipes" the
report offered.
