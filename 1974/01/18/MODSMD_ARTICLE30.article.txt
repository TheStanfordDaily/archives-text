# Ex-Football Star Kmetovic Directs Cardinal Ruggers
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Great Halfback? Why he's 6-2, 210, and has
great speed.
However indelible those qualifications may
sound to the average football fan today, they have
not always been the prerequisite for fame. Stanford
rugby coach Pete Kmetovic is hardly 6-2 and in his
prime he ran line a "very fast duck." Yet he was a
star halfback for the Wow Boys (Stanford football
team 1940). His 43-yard punt return in the 1941
Rose Bowl gave Stanford a 21-13 win over
Nebraska and earned him player-of-the-game
honors
Now Kmetovic is a fixture at the Stanford
Athletic Department, both as rugby coach and
manager of operations.
Kmetovic served in the Navy for four years and
played professional football for two years before
taking up coaching. Playing in the "City of
Brotherly Love" for the Philadelphia Eagles was an
experience for Kmetovic. "We played in Connie
Mack Stadium and we had to wear our helmets
even when we were sitting on the bench," he
recalls.
"I left pro football because after spending four
years in the service, I wasn't in prime condition.
The money then was also not as much as it is
today. There weren't any "$lOO thousand
bonuses."
Returned To Stanford
After spending a couple of years coaching prep
teams, Kmetovic returned to Stanford in 1950 as
an assistant football coach. He was also named head
rugby coach, although football remained his main
task. He retired from his football duties to become
an athletic department official in 1963.
Since then he's been manager of operations, a
task that involves the total operation of Stanford
Stadium and Maples Pavilion." Handling football
games has become more difficult," he said. With
the kids in the end zone trying to get the ball after
extra points you need a helmet." Almost like

Connie Mack Stadium.
Kmetovic's rugby teams have won the Monterey
National Tournament eight times and in 24 years of
coaching he has compiled a record of 191 wins, 55
ljbses, and nine ties. He has also won the "Big
Scrum Axe" seven times to California's four. In
his team won the Monterey tournament
without allowing a point in four games.
Few Changes
In 24 years he must have seen a lot of changes,
right? "I've seen very little change in rugby,"
Kmotovic said. "The reasons people play rugby are
still the same. 1 played rugby because somebody
just grabbed me and it seems to happen in the same
way today."
"Rugby is a player-oriented sport, which means
that you have to have a strong team leader."
Kmetovic remembers Dick Ragsdale, a member of
that '63 team as "one of the best players in
Stanford rugby history."
Rugby replaced football as the nation's primary
sport from 1906-17. This change was necessary
because President Teddy Roosevelt feared the
dangers of college football. Kmetovic disagreed.
"Football' players can play rugby without any
danger," he said. "In the years that I've coached
there has only been one injury which kept a player
out of football action the next year."
So football and rugby can exist side by side,
even for players that aren't 6-2, 210 pounds or
lightening fast.

his team won the Monterey tournament
without allowing a point in four games.
Few Changes
In 24 years he must have seen a lot of changes,
right? "I've seen very little change in rugby,"
Kmotovic said. "The reasons people play rugby are
still the same. 1 played rugby because somebody
just grabbed me and it seems to happen in the same
way today."
"Rugby is a player-oriented sport, which means
that you have to have a strong team leader."
Kmetovic remembers Dick Ragsdale, a member of
that '63 team as "one of the best players in
Stanford rugby history."
Rugby replaced football as the nation's primary
sport from 1906-17. This change was necessary
because President Teddy Roosevelt feared the
dangers of college football. Kmetovic disagreed.
"Football' players can play rugby without any
danger," he said. "In the years that I've coached
there has only been one injury which kept a player
out of football action the next year."
So football and rugby can exist side by side,
even for players that aren't 6-2, 210 pounds or
lightening fast.

THEN AND NOW — Pete Kmetovic, shown at left as a halfback for the Wow Boys of 1941 and at right as
the 1974 Stanford rugby coach, has always been a fixture around the Stanford athletic department. In
addition to his duties as rugby coach, Kmetovic is also manager of operations, a post he assumed in 1963.
Great Halfback? Why he's 6-2, 210, and has
great speed.
However indelible those qualifications may
sound to the average football fan today, they have
not always been the prerequisite for fame. Stanford
rugby coach Pete Kmetovic is hardly 6-2 and in his
prime he ran line a "very fast duck." Yet he was a
star halfback for the Wow Boys (Stanford football
team 1940). His 43-yard punt return in the 1941
Rose Bowl gave Stanford a 21-13 win over
Nebraska and earned him player-of-the-game
honors
Now Kmetovic is a fixture at the Stanford
Athletic Department, both as rugby coach and
manager of operations.
Kmetovic served in the Navy for four years and
played professional football for two years before
taking up coaching. Playing in the "City of
Brotherly Love" for the Philadelphia Eagles was an
experience for Kmetovic. "We played in Connie
Mack Stadium and we had to wear our helmets
even when we were sitting on the bench," he
recalls.
"I left pro football because after spending four
years in the service, I wasn't in prime condition.
The money then was also not as much as it is
today. There weren't any "$lOO thousand
bonuses."
Returned To Stanford
After spending a couple of years coaching prep
teams, Kmetovic returned to Stanford in 1950 as
an assistant football coach. He was also named head
rugby coach, although football remained his main
task. He retired from his football duties to become
an athletic department official in 1963.
Since then he's been manager of operations, a
task that involves the total operation of Stanford
Stadium and Maples Pavilion." Handling football
games has become more difficult," he said. With
the kids in the end zone trying to get the ball after
extra points you need a helmet." Almost like

Connie Mack Stadium.
Kmetovic's rugby teams have won the Monterey
National Tournament eight times and in 24 years of
coaching he has compiled a record of 191 wins, 55
ljbses, and nine ties. He has also won the "Big
Scrum Axe" seven times to California's four. In
his team won the Monterey tournament
without allowing a point in four games.
