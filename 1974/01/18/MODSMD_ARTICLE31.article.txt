# Rugby Team Meets SFRC
## 
### 
Tomorrow coach Pete Kmetovic's rugby team
takes on the San Francisco Rugby Club at 1:30
p.m. on the Stanford field behind Maples
Pavilion. The SFRC lost to St. Mary's 9-7 in the
opening round of Stanford's 10-a-side
tournament last month.
The Cards are coming off last week's 14-0
opening victory over St. Mary's in Moraga.
