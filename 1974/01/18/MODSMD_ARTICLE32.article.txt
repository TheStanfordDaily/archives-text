# Elis, Wolverines Await Swimmers
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
Back in the archaic times of 1969 and 1970 (early Paleozoic,
wasn't it?) Yale University met the Stanford Indians in two swim
meets, one home and one away. In '69 Yale clobbered the Indians
back in New Haven. One year later the Ivy-leaguers came to Stanford
and won again, this time by taking the last event.
Now, after four long years and a change of names, the Stanford
Cardinals travel to New Haven this weekend to again face Yale in
hopes of revenge.
Yale, always tough in its own pool, has some outstanding
swimmers. But if coach Jim Gaughran's team looks anywhere near the
way it looked last Saturday against the Washington Huskies, Yale
coach Philip Moriarty had better start looking for a blindfold and
thinking of his last requests.
The Cardinals are fresh off a stunning 62-51 victory over the
fourth-ranked Huskies in what was a marvelously performed total
team effort. Yale is not nationally ranked.

The meet' in New Haven
tomorrow night won't be the
highlight of the trip eastward,
however. Tonight the sixth-ranked
Cardinals face tenth-ranked
Michigan in Ann Arbor. It will be
the first dual meet confrontation
ever between the two teams. Led
by Tom Szuba, national AAU
400-yard individual medley
champion and one of the world's
best all-around swimmers, the
Wolverines should give the Cards a
battle.
Breaststroker Stu Isaac will be
a threat to John Hencken while
freestyler Jose Aranha's 46.6 in
the 100 will challenge Stanford's
sprinters. Isaac and Aranha,
combined with Szuba and
backstroker Paul Hansen, produce
a powerful medley relay. The
Wolverines also have some fine
divers.
Stanford's strength in both
meets should be its team balance.
In nearly every event the
Cardinals post nationally ranked
swimmers.
Both the 400 medley relay and
the 400 freestyle relay are number
one in the nation. Sprinters Dave
Fairbank, Bruce Goodwin, Dan
Anderson and Martin Pedley have
top times in the 50 and 100 free.
John Hencken's 200 breast and
200 individual medley times are
also tops in the nation. In the
distance races. Terry Sutton and
Steve Strong have starred with
outstanding times. In the
backstroke it's been Randy
Whitchurch.
The Cards have been training
hard this week, looking ahead to
the Pacific Eight and NCAA
championships. Middle distance
man Craig Van Zandt has been
sick this week, and sprinter Bruce
Goodwin is suffering from a
pinched nerve in his shoulder, but
both should be poised along with
the rest of the team for this
weekend's action.
"I don't think we should lose
to them," said Gaughran, referring
to both Michigan and Yale.
Although a victory over the
powerful Michigan swimmers will
be a greater accomplishment, a
win in New Haven should be just
as satisfying.
