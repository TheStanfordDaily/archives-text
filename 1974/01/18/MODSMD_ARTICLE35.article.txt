# Steve Hug: Gymnastics 'A Way Of Life'
## 
### MARK WHITE 
At first blush, anyone trying to gain a quick
understanding of what the person Steve Hug is —
that is to understand him in terms other than as a
5-6, 128 pound athlete — has a most difficult task
lying ahead. The collected, jaded, measured
responses to inquiring probes leave one, at first,
with a mixed sense of perplexity and unfulfillment.
For Steve Hug is simply not one of those people
who happily lays the cards out on the table and
then beams a proud little smile at you. After 11
years of competition (or, more precisely, steady
development) Steve Hug, the best gymnast in
America, has adopted a reticence those who have
been under scrutiny for years tend to develop.
Perhaps the reticence is related to Hug's unique
situation; most college athletes are in their prime
for a few short years, and probably have little need
to deal with their limited successes. Hug is a
two-time Olympian, has won the National
gymnastics title twice and has competed in
international meets since he was a freshman in high
school.
Obviously, next week's first Stanford meet of
the year is a mere workout for Hug.
At any rate, some of Hug's reticence can be
traced to the unusual, introspective standard of
success he employs in the sport that is such a major
factor in his life.
"When I began competing, many people
complimented me on my performance and
accomplishments in competition. I still get joy
from people appreciating the gymnastics when it is
good, but I'm not excited about the awards. I don't
like to hear 'Are you going to win this or that' or
'You did it,' referring to a title of some kind. This
is status, and not gymnastics.
"Some people ask me how I did at the Olympics.
'What place did you get?' Well they can't really
grasp what I was doing there. You see, competition
really isn't that much a part of why I do
gymnastics. The main thing for me in the Olympics
is to go work out and try to exchange something
with other gymnasts, and to enjoy working on fine
equipment."

Hug has mixed feelings about the Olympics;
while they offer the best opportunity for meeting
the finest gymnasts in the world, Hug dislikes
aspects of the mental atmosphere at the Games.
"When I was 16 I finished eighth in the Olympic
trials, worked out with the team for 10 weeks and
went down to Mexico as a member of our six-man
team. The feeling in Mexico was much friendlier
than in Munich; in '68 we were down there feeling
the culture and I was not too worried about
competition. I finished 36th, third best on the
team, but I really liked just participating with other
athletes.
"Munich ('72) was a much more competitive
feeling than Mexico. I felt the old 'not winning, but
taking part' feeling much more in Mexico than in
Munich. It's hard to take the Olympics seriously in
terms of placing and medals, for it's just gymnastics
like anyplace else, except that what you do is not
reflected in your score at all.
"When you stand before those judges it doesn't
only depend on how well you did. A little depends
on how the guy before you did and a lot depends
on what country you're from.
That's one of the reasons why competition is
relatively unimportant to me. The meets are just
part of your year. The most important part is the
workouts — that's the part I most enjoy. I guess a
lot of what I believe is a result of my stay in
Japan."
Learned The 'Basics'
Steve was a junior at Chatsworth High in
Northridge when he broke his right elbow warming
up for the World Invitational Gymnastics Meet. He
had just won the National All-around title and was
gaining international recognition when the injury
occurred.
"After I broke it [the elbow), theae Japanese
gymnasts talked to me about going to Japan. It
sounded good, so after I got my cast off I went.
"The first time I went to Japan I learned all the
basics — the important body positions — and I
didn't compete much. It was there that I learned
gymnastics as a way of life rather than as a means

to an end.
"At that time the gymnasts worked out very
hard just to work out; competition was not a part
of their plans. It was during this period that I
developed my ideas on competition.
"The Japanese have changed since then, though.
They now emphasize the competitive side, and as a
result, they are sacrificing the basics necessary for
beautiful gymnastics. Many more competitions take
place, and gymnasts on nearly all levels are
expected to take part. I don't like that aspect,
really; I think it should be more on your own;
when you are ready."
'His Own Way'
According to Stanford gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada, "doing things his own way" is a distinct
Hug trait. "Physically Steve has a very good
balancing sense and his movement is very naturally
smooth, but he is only fair in flexibility and
strength. He learned the basics in Japan, and
understood the importance of them; there are
other gymnasts close to him in some aspects, but his
strength in the basics is superior to that of the
other gymnasts. That is the reason he is the best in
the country.
"His concentration in practice is much greater
than anyone else's and is unique; he is truly a
strong individual. His goal is not winning but in
reaching his maximum potential; this is always the
goal that keeps him going.
"As far as a special role or the team is
concerned, Steve and I have never talked about it —
it's better if there is no pressure. I expect him to do
well in the nationals and the World Championships
this year, but as far as the team goes, his presence
at practice is enough. I hope the others on the team
watch his practice style, total concentration and
that they realize that intense practice is necessary
for all good gymnasts."
"When I was younger," Steve says, "traveling
and being with the best gymnasts was important,
but in the end, the main thing is getting that
natural joy of movement during workouts in the
gym and getting better."

the year is a mere workout for Hug.
At any rate, some of Hug's reticence can be
traced to the unusual, introspective standard of
success he employs in the sport that is such a major
factor in his life.
"When I began competing, many people
complimented me on my performance and
accomplishments in competition. I still get joy
from people appreciating the gymnastics when it is
good, but I'm not excited about the awards. I don't
like to hear 'Are you going to win this or that' or
'You did it,' referring to a title of some kind. This
is status, and not gymnastics.
"Some people ask me how I did at the Olympics.
'What place did you get?' Well they can't really
grasp what I was doing there. You see, competition
really isn't that much a part of why I do
gymnastics. The main thing for me in the Olympics
is to go work out and try to exchange something
with other gymnasts, and to enjoy working on fine
equipment."

Hug has mixed feelings about the Olympics;
while they offer the best opportunity for meeting
the finest gymnasts in the world, Hug dislikes
aspects of the mental atmosphere at the Games.
"When I was 16 I finished eighth in the Olympic
trials, worked out with the team for 10 weeks and
went down to Mexico as a member of our six-man
team. The feeling in Mexico was much friendlier
than in Munich; in '68 we were down there feeling
the culture and I was not too worried about
competition. I finished 36th, third best on the
team, but I really liked just participating with other
athletes.
"Munich ('72) was a much more competitive
feeling than Mexico. I felt the old 'not winning, but
taking part' feeling much more in Mexico than in
Munich. It's hard to take the Olympics seriously in
terms of placing and medals, for it's just gymnastics
like anyplace else, except that what you do is not
reflected in your score at all.
"When you stand before those judges it doesn't
only depend on how well you did. A little depends
on how the guy before you did and a lot depends
on what country you're from.
That's one of the reasons why competition is
relatively unimportant to me. The meets are just
part of your year. The most important part is the
workouts — that's the part I most enjoy. I guess a
lot of what I believe is a result of my stay in
Japan."
Learned The 'Basics'
Steve was a junior at Chatsworth High in
Northridge when he broke his right elbow warming
up for the World Invitational Gymnastics Meet. He
had just won the National All-around title and was
gaining international recognition when the injury
occurred.
"After I broke it [the elbow), theae Japanese
gymnasts talked to me about going to Japan. It
sounded good, so after I got my cast off I went.
"The first time I went to Japan I learned all the
basics — the important body positions — and I
didn't compete much. It was there that I learned
gymnastics as a way of life rather than as a means

to an end.
"At that time the gymnasts worked out very
hard just to work out; competition was not a part
of their plans. It was during this period that I
developed my ideas on competition.
"The Japanese have changed since then, though.
They now emphasize the competitive side, and as a
result, they are sacrificing the basics necessary for
beautiful gymnastics. Many more competitions take
place, and gymnasts on nearly all levels are
expected to take part. I don't like that aspect,
really; I think it should be more on your own;
when you are ready."
'His Own Way'
According to Stanford gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada, "doing things his own way" is a distinct
Hug trait. "Physically Steve has a very good
balancing sense and his movement is very naturally
smooth, but he is only fair in flexibility and
strength. He learned the basics in Japan, and
understood the importance of them; there are
other gymnasts close to him in some aspects, but his
strength in the basics is superior to that of the
other gymnasts. That is the reason he is the best in
the country.
"His concentration in practice is much greater
than anyone else's and is unique; he is truly a
strong individual. His goal is not winning but in
reaching his maximum potential; this is always the
goal that keeps him going.
"As far as a special role or the team is
concerned, Steve and I have never talked about it —
it's better if there is no pressure. I expect him to do
well in the nationals and the World Championships
this year, but as far as the team goes, his presence
at practice is enough. I hope the others on the team
watch his practice style, total concentration and
that they realize that intense practice is necessary
for all good gymnasts."
"When I was younger," Steve says, "traveling
and being with the best gymnasts was important,
but in the end, the main thing is getting that
natural joy of movement during workouts in the
gym and getting better."

STEVE HUG ... UPSIDE DOWN
At first blush, anyone trying to gain a quick
understanding of what the person Steve Hug is —
that is to understand him in terms other than as a
5-6, 128 pound athlete — has a most difficult task
lying ahead. The collected, jaded, measured
responses to inquiring probes leave one, at first,
with a mixed sense of perplexity and unfulfillment.
For Steve Hug is simply not one of those people
who happily lays the cards out on the table and
then beams a proud little smile at you. After 11
years of competition (or, more precisely, steady
development) Steve Hug, the best gymnast in
America, has adopted a reticence those who have
been under scrutiny for years tend to develop.
Perhaps the reticence is related to Hug's unique
situation; most college athletes are in their prime
for a few short years, and probably have little need
to deal with their limited successes. Hug is a
two-time Olympian, has won the National
gymnastics title twice and has competed in
international meets since he was a freshman in high
school.
Obviously, next week's first Stanford meet of
the year is a mere workout for Hug.
At any rate, some of Hug's reticence can be

aspects of the mental atmosphere at the Games.
"When I was 16 I finished eighth in the Olympic
trials, worked out with the team for 10 weeks and
went down to Mexico as a member of our six-man
team. The feeling in Mexico was much friendlier
than in Munich; in '68 we were down there feeling
the culture and I was not too worried about
competition. I finished 36th, third best on the
team, but I really liked just participating with other
athletes.
"Munich ('72) was a much more competitive
feeling than Mexico. I felt the old 'not winning, but
taking part' feeling much more in Mexico than in
Munich. It's hard to take the Olympics seriously in
terms of placing and medals, for it's just gymnastics
like anyplace else, except that what you do is not
reflected in your score at all.
"When you stand before those judges it doesn't
only depend on how well you did. A little depends
on how the guy before you did and a lot depends
on what country you're from.
That's one of the reasons why competition is
relatively unimportant to me. The meets are just
part of your year. The most important part is the
workouts — that's the part I most enjoy. I guess a
lot of what I believe is a result of my stay in
Japan."
Learned The 'Basics'
Steve was a junior at Chatsworth High in
Northridge when he broke his right elbow warming
up for the World Invitational Gymnastics Meet. He
had just won the National All-around title and was
gaining international recognition when the injury
occurred.
"After I broke it [the elbow), theae Japanese
gymnasts talked to me about going to Japan. It
sounded good, so after I got my cast off I went.
"The first time I went to Japan I learned all the
basics — the important body positions — and I
didn't compete much. It was there that I learned
gymnastics as a way of life rather than as a means

to an end.
"At that time the gymnasts worked out very
hard just to work out; competition was not a part
of their plans. It was during this period that I
developed my ideas on competition.
"The Japanese have changed since then, though.
They now emphasize the competitive side, and as a
result, they are sacrificing the basics necessary for
beautiful gymnastics. Many more competitions take
place, and gymnasts on nearly all levels are
expected to take part. I don't like that aspect,
really; I think it should be more on your own;
when you are ready."
'His Own Way'
According to Stanford gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada, "doing things his own way" is a distinct
Hug trait. "Physically Steve has a very good
balancing sense and his movement is very naturally
smooth, but he is only fair in flexibility and
strength. He learned the basics in Japan, and
understood the importance of them; there are
other gymnasts close to him in some aspects, but his
strength in the basics is superior to that of the
other gymnasts. That is the reason he is the best in
the country.
"His concentration in practice is much greater
than anyone else's and is unique; he is truly a
strong individual. His goal is not winning but in
reaching his maximum potential; this is always the
goal that keeps him going.
"As far as a special role or the team is
concerned, Steve and I have never talked about it —
it's better if there is no pressure. I expect him to do
well in the nationals and the World Championships
this year, but as far as the team goes, his presence
at practice is enough. I hope the others on the team
watch his practice style, total concentration and
that they realize that intense practice is necessary
for all good gymnasts."
"When I was younger," Steve says, "traveling
and being with the best gymnasts was important,
but in the end, the main thing is getting that
natural joy of movement during workouts in the
gym and getting better."

STEVE HUG ... UPSIDE DOWN
At first blush, anyone trying to gain a quick
understanding of what the person Steve Hug is —
that is to understand him in terms other than as a
5-6, 128 pound athlete — has a most difficult task
lying ahead. The collected, jaded, measured
responses to inquiring probes leave one, at first,
with a mixed sense of perplexity and unfulfillment.
For Steve Hug is simply not one of those people
who happily lays the cards out on the table and
then beams a proud little smile at you. After 11
years of competition (or, more precisely, steady
development) Steve Hug, the best gymnast in
America, has adopted a reticence those who have
been under scrutiny for years tend to develop.
Perhaps the reticence is related to Hug's unique
situation; most college athletes are in their prime
for a few short years, and probably have little need
to deal with their limited successes. Hug is a
two-time Olympian, has won the National
gymnastics title twice and has competed in
international meets since he was a freshman in high
school.
Obviously, next week's first Stanford meet of
the year is a mere workout for Hug.
At any rate, some of Hug's reticence can be
traced to the unusual, introspective standard of
success he employs in the sport that is such a major
factor in his life.
"When I began competing, many people
complimented me on my performance and
accomplishments in competition. I still get joy
from people appreciating the gymnastics when it is
good, but I'm not excited about the awards. I don't
like to hear 'Are you going to win this or that' or
'You did it,' referring to a title of some kind. This
is status, and not gymnastics.
"Some people ask me how I did at the Olympics.
'What place did you get?' Well they can't really
grasp what I was doing there. You see, competition
really isn't that much a part of why I do
gymnastics. The main thing for me in the Olympics
is to go work out and try to exchange something
with other gymnasts, and to enjoy working on fine
equipment."

Hug has mixed feelings about the Olympics;
while they offer the best opportunity for meeting
the finest gymnasts in the world, Hug dislikes
aspects of the mental atmosphere at the Games.
