# Wrestlers Host Aztecs

### BRUCE KADDEN 
Tomorrow night is the only
chance in more than a month for
Stanford fans to see the wrestling
team in action. At 6:30 p.m. the
grappiers take on San Diego State
in Maples Paviiion.
The Aztecs are one of the best
college division teams in the state,
boasting a 3-0 season record.
Stanford Coach Joe De Meo said
"They're pretty good . . . we'll do
well against them."
The Cards will have to do well
with no less than five wrestlers
who started this season watching
from the sidelines injured. The
latest two are Emmett Stanton
(158) and Gary Anderson (Hwt).
De Meo hopes that both will be
back in action by the Oregon trip
in early February.
The Cards will send a young
lineup against San Diego, with
four freshmen, three sophomores
and two juniors. But it has been a
young lineup that has carried
Stanford this season after an
unbelievable number of injuries
plagued the team.
Last Tuesday the Cards
traveled to San Luis Obispo and
were thumped by Cal Poly, 37-5.
With our full team we would have
been close, De Meo said of the
loss to the top-rated team in
California.
Stanford had a few bright
spots. Freshman Mark Yancey
continued his brilliant wrestling
with a 10-7 decision. Yancey
trailed 3-0 after one minute of the
second round, but turned the
match around with an escape, a
takedown and a nearfall. He built
up a 9-3 lead before his opponent
scored again.
Marc Frelier (177) got the
other Card points, in a 4-4 draw.
Frelier scored with two escapes,
while Bob Whitaker, his foe, had a
reversal. Both wrestlers were
penalized twice for stalling.
Whitaker was only nine seconds
short of picking up a point for
riding time.
Charlie Masch (150) turned in
a strong losing battle, commented
De Meo. He was topped, 3-0, by
Grant Arnold, a junior red-shirt.
The Cards had to forfeit three
matches, one because De Meo said
he didn't want to put up one of
his grappiers against Poly's
350-pound heavyweight. Do you
blame him?

NO MORE JUMP SHOTS — Dave Frost, Stanford's second leading
scorer with a 13.6 average, announced yesterday that he is quitting
the basketball team because of recurring knee problems. Frost, who
"was playing with the knowledge that the knee is getting worse," will
probably undergo surgery late next week. He hopes to be ready for at
least part of Stanford's baseball season.
