# Knee Surgery Probable
## Frost Quits Basketball Team 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Dave Frost, Stanford's second
leading scorer and most consistent
1973-74 performer, announced
yesterday that he is quitting the
team because of chronic knee
problems.
"It would be possible for me to
continue playing," said Frost,
who has considerable cartilage
damage in his right knee, "but I
would be playing with the
knowledge that it's getting
worse."
Frost was advised by Stanford
team physician Dr. Fred Behling
that waiting until after the
basketball season ended was
"questionable" because "cartilage
damage doesn't repair itself."
Behling is currently on
vacation and will return to the
area on Thursday. At that time
Frost will discuss the situation
with Behling and will most likely
undergo surgery on Friday.
A major factor in Frost's
decision was his future in baseball.
He has compiled a 10-0 record as
a pitcher in two years of varsity
action and has seriously
considered a professional career.
"It was a timing thing," Frost
said. "Now is the time to take
care of it; if I waited any longer it
would really hurt my baseball."
Frost, who was averaging 13.6
points per game, has been

bothered by knee, back and ankle
problems throughout an
injury-ridden career.
"It's a shame Dave was never
able to operate at 100 percent
physical efficiency during his
Stanford career," Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar said yesterday.
"He's had chronic problems with
muscle spasms in his back, and
more than once has been placed in
traction at half time."
Despite the injuries, Frost
managed to average 10.5 points
per game as a sophomore and 8.9
last year. Some of the highlights
of his career included a 26-point
effort earlier this year against La
Salle at Madison Square Garden
and two 20-plus performances
against UCLA.
The coaching staff indicated
that Frost's starting spot would be
filled by either Tim Patterson
(6-11), Mike Mann (6-9) or Scott
Trobbe (6-6) when the Cards meet
Utah tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Salt
Lake City. Monday night,
Stanford travels to Colorado
Springs for a 7:30 p.m. game
against Air Force.
Bluitt Will Start
Earlier yesterday, Dallmar
announced another lineup change.
Ben Bluitt, who has connected on
several long bombs in the last four
games, will replace Mark Gilberg
at one guard spot. Bluitt will join

Rich Kelley, Melvin Arterberry,
Ed Schweitzer and either
Patterson, Mann or Trobbe in
tomorrow's starting five.
The new lineup will be facing
an explosive Utah team. The
Running Utes are undefeated at
the Special Events Center Arena
in Salt Lake City and 10-3 overall.
"They're undoubtedly a tough
opponent," Dallmar said.
Leading the Utah attack are
guards Luther "Ticky" Burden,
who is averaging 20.1 points per
game, and Tyrone Medley, a 17.4
scorer. Center Mike Sojourner
follows with a 15.3 scoring
average and a 12.0 rebounding
mark. The team is shooting over
51 percent from the floor,
including a 63 percent outburst in
a recent victory over Brigham
Young.
Monday night, Stanford travels
to Colorado Springs to face a
short but sprightly Air Force
Squad. The Cadets, whose tallest
player is 6-7, are 2-7 on the
season. But Dallmar warns that
"they have to be excited after
their recent intra-service victory
over Navy at Annapolis."
Stanford, now 5-7 on the

season and 0-4 in the Pac-8 "isn't
down or discouraged despite our
0-4 conference record," according
to Dallmar. "The Los Angeles trip
showed we can play against the
best."
Last weekend the Cards played
tough, though not errorless,
basketball in losses against USC
and UCLA.

Cardinal Notes: Believe it or
not, Stanford leads the Pac-8 in
one statistical category. Cardinal
opponents have managed only a
.595 free throw percentage, so
Stanford is currently the top team
in the conference in free throw
defense. UCLA, ironically, is last
in that crucial category, so Bruin
coach John Wooden will
undoubtedly be drilling his club
on free throw defense the
remainder of the year.
Last year against Utah, Kelley
scored 30 points, grabbed 12
rebounds and had no turnovers.
Neither game this weekend will
be broadcast on radio. KSFO
resumes its Stanford basketball
coverage next Saturday when the
Cards host Denver at Maples
Pavilion.
