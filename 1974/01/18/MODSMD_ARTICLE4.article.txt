# Ping Pong Champ Lauds Chinese
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Two years ago the Chinese table
tennis team gave an exhibition at
Maples Pavilion and showed Stanford
students that ping pong is not just
something you play in the basement
on a rainy day.

"China's the best thing that ever
happened to the sport," says freshman
Judy Bochenski, a member of the
1971 national table tennis team which
received the historic invitation to visit
China. Bochenski, who is the U.S.
junior women's table tennis champion,
believes in "ping pong diplomacy."
"They talk a whole lot about
friendship in table tennis," she says.
"It's one thing people can have in
common."
The team spent eight days in China
and visited the Great Wall, Peking
University, a commune and a factory.
At the Great Hall of the People, the
players met Premier Chou En-lai.
Bochenski remembers the
friendliness of the Chinese, who let the
outclassed Americans win a few
matches to save face. "I really admired
the way they looked at life — more
simply than most Americans. A
Chinese player asked me why
American girls wear something
different every day."
For Bochenski, the opportunity to
travel is one of the most enjoyable
features of competitive table tennis.
She went to Japan in 1971 and to
Yugoslavia in 1973 for the world
championships. One summer she
traveled around the country playing
exhibition games at shopping centers
and taking all challengers.
Her father, a player and coach, gave

her an early start. She joined a ping
pong club at the age of 11 and soon
began winning tournaments in her age
group. "When I was just starting, it
was a lot of fun because I was
improving very fast," she recalls.
Women's table tennis is gaining
prestige as more women become active
in the sport. "They used to put us on
the worst tables," Bochenski says.
"Now it's getting better. There was a
big controversy about letting women
play in the men's open. Now we can
do that." She thinks that "the top ten
women can play pretty well against
the top 25 men."
There's not much money to be
made playing ping pong. Recently, a
$5000 tournament was held at Kansas
City. That's big money for ping pong.
The world champion earns a great deal
endorsing equipment, but the average
player has a hard time even covering
travel expenses.
She hasn't played much since she
entered college in the fall, but she
plans to go to the Nationals in the
spring. "11l have to get back in
training," she admits. Before the world
competitions, the U.S. team trained
for seven hours a day for two weeks.
Judy Bochenski isn't sure what
kind of a future she has in competitive
table tennis. However, it has
influenced her Stanford career in one
way — she's thinking of taking
Chinese.
