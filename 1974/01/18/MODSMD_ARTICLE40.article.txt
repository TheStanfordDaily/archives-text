# Red Vests On The Road: All Bozos On This Bus
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Few things in the world can stop the
Stanford Band. Police departments, irate
alumni and other college bands have never had
much success dealing with the LSJUMB. But
last weekend the Incomparables met their
match.
Where countless others have tried and failed,
a rapidly decaying Edsel Trailways bus
succeeded. With a driver even Jack Webb
would've been proud of at the controls, this
chartered marvel twice in one night destroyed
the best laid plans of America's most
outrageous college band.
Somehow, running out of gas twice seemed a
fitting climax to the Band's annual Los Angeles
trip, which had begun innocently enough 57
hours earlier.
Around 10 p.m. last Thursday night, an
apparent cross section of male Stanford
students could be seen boarding the green and
silver charter in front of the Band Shak. Things

JOLLY DOLLY — Stephanie Jubina models her
new earrings in Pauley Pavilion before last
Saturday's UCLA-Stanford game. Jubina and
her fellow dollies danced up a storm all
weekend, but still had enough energy on the
return trip to venture into the back-of-the-bus
jungle where the wildest of the bandsmen hung
out. Three dollies are still reported missing.

seemed fairly calm and I thought I might even
get some studying done on the trip. That myth
lasted about two minutes.
Before the Edsel was even started up for the
first time, busdriver L.L. Lewis, who reminds
one vividly of the Three Stooges' Curly, laid
down some ground rules. He said he didn't
want any emergency windows pushed out onto
passing cars and he didn't want any "garbage"
to be smoked on his bus. The applause was not
overwhelming.
So White Lightnin' became an even more
important part of the seven hour trip to LA.
Demon alcohol became especially predominant
in the life of an anonymous Daily reporter, who
was last seen hanging out of a bus window
looking for Kohoutek, on Interstate 5 near
Coalinga.
Insane Establishment
The tranquility of the Sunset Strip
Continental Hyatt House was rudely shattered
at 5 a.m. Friday morning as 45 drunk and tired
bandsmen, one bandswoman, five sober and
tired dollies and one pale Daily reporter
stumbled into the only non-Skid Row
establishment insane enough to allow them.
When you go to bed at 6 a.m., time certainly
flies by and soon the Red Vesters and dollies
were on their way to the world famous Busch
Gardens. The crowd awaiting the music men
was not exactly massive. But not wanting to
forfeit a chance for free beer, the Band
entertained 37 customers, 14 employees and
128 birds for 45 minutes before descending on
the kegs that made Anheuser famous.
Friday afternoon belched by quickly and
after surviving another ride on LA's freeways,
the Band invaded Phillipes, where "the elite
meet to eat pickled pigs' feet."
Phillipes also features French Dip
sandwiches, a Geritol-set clientele, a 5c cup of
coffee and a healthy portion of sawdust spread
all over the floor. Although someone suggested
that the sawdust was a Euell Gibbons leftover,
it was more likely that it was a precautionary
measure for the Band's visit. The Incomparables
quickly devoured everything in sight and then
loaded their bottles under their arms and
headed for the Sports Arena.
Secret Game Plan
The Band is traditionally the only Stanford
victor on these LA basketball trips, but once
again Howie Dallmar ignored the Band's
strategic advice and ended up with two losses to
show for it. In their trip itinerary, the Red
Vesters revealed their top-secret USC game plan
— "Howie locks himself in locker room and the
team scores an upset victory." Despite the
Band's pleadings, neither event occurred on
Friday night.
But the Incomparables did win the annual
Battle of the Bands with their southern rivals,
the USC "Weenies." Despite having twice as
many musicians, the Trojan noisemakers still
sounded like a poor recording of their Palo Alto
counterparts.
In all fairness, the USC Band should be
commended for attempting to join Stanford in
an exodus from the musical Dark Ages most
college bands still inhabit. USC Band Manager
Art Bartner admits that Stanford has had an
influence on his group and the fact that the

Trojans are trying to follow the footsteps of the
Red Vesters is an obvious compliment.
Unfortunately, the shoes still don't fit quite
yet.
After a quick return trip to the Strip, the
Red Vesters split up to follow their individual
fetishes. Some Bandspeople and the dollies
partied, while other Red Vesters tried to break
into pornographic news racks on the Strip. But
the hottest action occurred in Room 307 where
a motley crew viewed the UCLA-Cal game
replay, roller derby and"The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." A good time was had by all.
'Skinhead'
The Saturday afternoon leg of the journey
didn't get off to a roaring start. After giving a
play-by-play account of his thrilling Friday
night activities, bus driver "Skinhead" Lewis
discovered that his solid plastic name plate was
missing from its perch above his seat. Like a kid
without his Maypo, he made it clear that unless
his identity was restored, it would be a long
walk to UCLA.
The thief quickly returned the name plate
and soon the bus crunched into Westwood.
Getting out of bed for an afternoon game
hadn't gone over real big and when the Red
Vests discovered they had been given seats that
were close to being outside of Pauley Pavilion,
they appeared on the verge of revolutionary
action.
The angry Band wasted little time in
musically destroying the Bruin Band, much to
the delight of many of the UCLA students in
attendance. There was little doubt that a large
number of those students preferred the
progressiveness of the Incomparables to the
Guy Lombardon arrangements of their own
band.
Some Bandsmen almost lit victory cigars
when the Cardinals jumped out to a surprising
early lead, but the matches were quickly
stashed as the inevitable occurred. In a brief
post-game concert, the LSJUMB literally blew
the Bruin Band out of its own pavilion and the
locals were so embarrassed that they didn't
even show up later at a party both bands had
been invited to.
Singles Complex
Unfortunately, hardly anyone else showed
up at the party either. It was supposed to be
some kind of alumni affair and it was held at
one of those singles apartment complexes in
Marina Del Rey where everyone looks like a
Madison Ave. conception of what people who
live in singles apartments should look like.
The Band was treated to a magnificent
dinner of assorted cold cuts and baked beans,
the latter of which went over especially big on
the trip home. After waiting a lengthy period to
see if more than 25 people would show up, the
Band performed briefly and then boarded the
bus for the long trip home. At least the party
yielded a few more signs which the Band could
add to its booty.
Despite the hectic hours in LA, the Band
remained very lively on the trip home. When
the beer ran out,' the bread fights began and
two Bandsmen even lost their pants
momentarily as punishment for assorted high
crimes and misdemeanors.

The dollies, who had stayed at the front of
the bus in collective safety on the way down,
periodically crossed the DMZ (De-Moralized
Zone) on the way home and joined some of
their musical accompaniers in the rear of the
bus. In a rare moment of sober seriousness, a
veteran bandsman commented that these dollies
were probably the most down-to-earth and
friendliest dollies in recent history.
But just when it seemed that the trip would
be remembered mainly as yet another series of
Stanford Band victories, the bus made its move.
The bus achieved its first triumph around 4:15
Sunday morning in the sleepy town of Cilroy, a
southern suburb of Morgan Hill.
*3c Mello Mint'
Gilroy is one of those innumerable central
California towns which make Los Angeles look
like the Garden of Eden by comparison. With
the greatest of finesse, the Edsel crunched to a
stop at an ARCO gas station which included
Cindy's Restaurant, "home of the 3c Mello
Mint."
Cindy's was the last in a long line of truck
stops and greasy spoons that marred the trip.
Typical of their approach was the use of
Pennz.oil and vinegar for salad dressing. It made
you awfully hungry for even dorm food.

Soon after the heartiest of the hearty had
slid a final truck stop meal into their well-oiled
stomachs, the pickup with the diesel fuel
arrived and the Edsel was on the road again.
But not for long.
Fifty miles and one hour later, the Edsel
again finished off its load and came screeching
to a halt two miles east of campus on
Embarcadero Road. And this time there was no
truck stop in sight.
A few of the Incomparables hoofed it home,
but the majority passed the time waiting for a
replacement bus by telling jokes about the
driver's hair cut. Some suggested that an
emergency drop-out window be tested while
the driver was standing under it. That
suggestioned failed narrowly in a voice vote.
Thirty minutes later the Edsel was replaced by
a new improved model which trucked the
merry musicmakers back to the Shak just as the
Sunday sun was rising over Encina Hall.
The LA weekend was finally over and
neither the City of Angels nor this reporter
would ever be the same again. When they turn
me away at the Gates of Heaven some day, 111
look back and blame the Stanford Band. But it
will have been a hell of a lot of fun while it
lasted.

SIGN IN PLEASE — Next time you're hit by a truck while driving the wrong way on a freeway
off-ramp, remember that the missing Do Not Enter sign is probably hanging in the Band Shak.
On last weekend's Los Angeles trip, the Red Vesters made numerous additions to their already
healthy supply of signs. Most notable among their thefts was a bullet-proof glass covered,
R odium-mounted map of ihe Mariner's Village singles apartment complex in Marina Del Rey.
umerous grand jury indictments are expected to be announced soon in that case.

passing cars and he didn't want any "garbage"
to be smoked on his bus. The applause was not
overwhelming.
So White Lightnin' became an even more
important part of the seven hour trip to LA.
Demon alcohol became especially predominant
in the life of an anonymous Daily reporter, who
was last seen hanging out of a bus window
looking for Kohoutek, on Interstate 5 near
Coalinga.
Insane Establishment
The tranquility of the Sunset Strip
Continental Hyatt House was rudely shattered
at 5 a.m. Friday morning as 45 drunk and tired
bandsmen, one bandswoman, five sober and
tired dollies and one pale Daily reporter
stumbled into the only non-Skid Row
establishment insane enough to allow them.
When you go to bed at 6 a.m., time certainly
flies by and soon the Red Vesters and dollies
were on their way to the world famous Busch
Gardens. The crowd awaiting the music men
was not exactly massive. But not wanting to
forfeit a chance for free beer, the Band
entertained 37 customers, 14 employees and
128 birds for 45 minutes before descending on
the kegs that made Anheuser famous.
Friday afternoon belched by quickly and
after surviving another ride on LA's freeways,
the Band invaded Phillipes, where "the elite
meet to eat pickled pigs' feet."
Phillipes also features French Dip
sandwiches, a Geritol-set clientele, a 5c cup of
coffee and a healthy portion of sawdust spread
all over the floor. Although someone suggested
that the sawdust was a Euell Gibbons leftover,
it was more likely that it was a precautionary
measure for the Band's visit. The Incomparables
quickly devoured everything in sight and then
loaded their bottles under their arms and
headed for the Sports Arena.
Secret Game Plan
The Band is traditionally the only Stanford
victor on these LA basketball trips, but once
again Howie Dallmar ignored the Band's
strategic advice and ended up with two losses to
show for it. In their trip itinerary, the Red
Vesters revealed their top-secret USC game plan
— "Howie locks himself in locker room and the
team scores an upset victory." Despite the
Band's pleadings, neither event occurred on
Friday night.
But the Incomparables did win the annual
Battle of the Bands with their southern rivals,
the USC "Weenies." Despite having twice as
many musicians, the Trojan noisemakers still
sounded like a poor recording of their Palo Alto
counterparts.
In all fairness, the USC Band should be
commended for attempting to join Stanford in
an exodus from the musical Dark Ages most
college bands still inhabit. USC Band Manager
Art Bartner admits that Stanford has had an
influence on his group and the fact that the

Trojans are trying to follow the footsteps of the
Red Vesters is an obvious compliment.
Unfortunately, the shoes still don't fit quite
yet.
After a quick return trip to the Strip, the
Red Vesters split up to follow their individual
fetishes. Some Bandspeople and the dollies
partied, while other Red Vesters tried to break
into pornographic news racks on the Strip. But
the hottest action occurred in Room 307 where
a motley crew viewed the UCLA-Cal game
replay, roller derby and"The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." A good time was had by all.
'Skinhead'
The Saturday afternoon leg of the journey
didn't get off to a roaring start. After giving a
play-by-play account of his thrilling Friday
night activities, bus driver "Skinhead" Lewis
discovered that his solid plastic name plate was
missing from its perch above his seat. Like a kid
without his Maypo, he made it clear that unless
his identity was restored, it would be a long
walk to UCLA.
The thief quickly returned the name plate
and soon the bus crunched into Westwood.
Getting out of bed for an afternoon game
hadn't gone over real big and when the Red
Vests discovered they had been given seats that
were close to being outside of Pauley Pavilion,
they appeared on the verge of revolutionary
action.
The angry Band wasted little time in
musically destroying the Bruin Band, much to
the delight of many of the UCLA students in
attendance. There was little doubt that a large
number of those students preferred the
progressiveness of the Incomparables to the
Guy Lombardon arrangements of their own
band.
Some Bandsmen almost lit victory cigars
when the Cardinals jumped out to a surprising
early lead, but the matches were quickly
stashed as the inevitable occurred. In a brief
post-game concert, the LSJUMB literally blew
the Bruin Band out of its own pavilion and the
locals were so embarrassed that they didn't
even show up later at a party both bands had
been invited to.
Singles Complex
Unfortunately, hardly anyone else showed
up at the party either. It was supposed to be
some kind of alumni affair and it was held at
one of those singles apartment complexes in
Marina Del Rey where everyone looks like a
Madison Ave. conception of what people who
live in singles apartments should look like.
The Band was treated to a magnificent
dinner of assorted cold cuts and baked beans,
the latter of which went over especially big on
the trip home. After waiting a lengthy period to
see if more than 25 people would show up, the
Band performed briefly and then boarded the
bus for the long trip home. At least the party
yielded a few more signs which the Band could
add to its booty.
Despite the hectic hours in LA, the Band
remained very lively on the trip home. When
the beer ran out,' the bread fights began and
two Bandsmen even lost their pants
momentarily as punishment for assorted high
crimes and misdemeanors.

The dollies, who had stayed at the front of
the bus in collective safety on the way down,
periodically crossed the DMZ (De-Moralized
Zone) on the way home and joined some of
their musical accompaniers in the rear of the
bus. In a rare moment of sober seriousness, a
veteran bandsman commented that these dollies
were probably the most down-to-earth and
friendliest dollies in recent history.
But just when it seemed that the trip would
be remembered mainly as yet another series of
Stanford Band victories, the bus made its move.
The bus achieved its first triumph around 4:15
Sunday morning in the sleepy town of Cilroy, a
southern suburb of Morgan Hill.
*3c Mello Mint'
Gilroy is one of those innumerable central
California towns which make Los Angeles look
like the Garden of Eden by comparison. With
the greatest of finesse, the Edsel crunched to a
stop at an ARCO gas station which included
Cindy's Restaurant, "home of the 3c Mello
Mint."
Cindy's was the last in a long line of truck
stops and greasy spoons that marred the trip.
Typical of their approach was the use of
Pennz.oil and vinegar for salad dressing. It made
you awfully hungry for even dorm food.

Soon after the heartiest of the hearty had
slid a final truck stop meal into their well-oiled
stomachs, the pickup with the diesel fuel
arrived and the Edsel was on the road again.
But not for long.
Fifty miles and one hour later, the Edsel
again finished off its load and came screeching
to a halt two miles east of campus on
Embarcadero Road. And this time there was no
truck stop in sight.
A few of the Incomparables hoofed it home,
but the majority passed the time waiting for a
replacement bus by telling jokes about the
driver's hair cut. Some suggested that an
emergency drop-out window be tested while
the driver was standing under it. That
suggestioned failed narrowly in a voice vote.
Thirty minutes later the Edsel was replaced by
a new improved model which trucked the
merry musicmakers back to the Shak just as the
Sunday sun was rising over Encina Hall.
The LA weekend was finally over and
neither the City of Angels nor this reporter
would ever be the same again. When they turn
me away at the Gates of Heaven some day, 111
look back and blame the Stanford Band. But it
will have been a hell of a lot of fun while it
lasted.

SIGN IN PLEASE — Next time you're hit by a truck while driving the wrong way on a freeway
off-ramp, remember that the missing Do Not Enter sign is probably hanging in the Band Shak.
On last weekend's Los Angeles trip, the Red Vesters made numerous additions to their already
healthy supply of signs. Most notable among their thefts was a bullet-proof glass covered,
R odium-mounted map of ihe Mariner's Village singles apartment complex in Marina Del Rey.
umerous grand jury indictments are expected to be announced soon in that case.
Few things in the world can stop the
Stanford Band. Police departments, irate
alumni and other college bands have never had
much success dealing with the LSJUMB. But
last weekend the Incomparables met their
match.
Where countless others have tried and failed,
a rapidly decaying Edsel Trailways bus
succeeded. With a driver even Jack Webb
would've been proud of at the controls, this
chartered marvel twice in one night destroyed
the best laid plans of America's most
outrageous college band.
Somehow, running out of gas twice seemed a
fitting climax to the Band's annual Los Angeles
trip, which had begun innocently enough 57
hours earlier.
Around 10 p.m. last Thursday night, an
apparent cross section of male Stanford
students could be seen boarding the green and
silver charter in front of the Band Shak. Things

quickly devoured everything in sight and then
loaded their bottles under their arms and
headed for the Sports Arena.
Secret Game Plan
The Band is traditionally the only Stanford
victor on these LA basketball trips, but once
again Howie Dallmar ignored the Band's
strategic advice and ended up with two losses to
show for it. In their trip itinerary, the Red
Vesters revealed their top-secret USC game plan
— "Howie locks himself in locker room and the
team scores an upset victory." Despite the
Band's pleadings, neither event occurred on
Friday night.
But the Incomparables did win the annual
Battle of the Bands with their southern rivals,
the USC "Weenies." Despite having twice as
many musicians, the Trojan noisemakers still
sounded like a poor recording of their Palo Alto
counterparts.
In all fairness, the USC Band should be
commended for attempting to join Stanford in
an exodus from the musical Dark Ages most
college bands still inhabit. USC Band Manager
Art Bartner admits that Stanford has had an
influence on his group and the fact that the

Trojans are trying to follow the footsteps of the
Red Vesters is an obvious compliment.
Unfortunately, the shoes still don't fit quite
yet.
After a quick return trip to the Strip, the
Red Vesters split up to follow their individual
fetishes. Some Bandspeople and the dollies
partied, while other Red Vesters tried to break
into pornographic news racks on the Strip. But
the hottest action occurred in Room 307 where
a motley crew viewed the UCLA-Cal game
replay, roller derby and"The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." A good time was had by all.
'Skinhead'
The Saturday afternoon leg of the journey
didn't get off to a roaring start. After giving a
play-by-play account of his thrilling Friday
night activities, bus driver "Skinhead" Lewis
discovered that his solid plastic name plate was
missing from its perch above his seat. Like a kid
without his Maypo, he made it clear that unless
his identity was restored, it would be a long
walk to UCLA.
The thief quickly returned the name plate
and soon the bus crunched into Westwood.
Getting out of bed for an afternoon game
hadn't gone over real big and when the Red
Vests discovered they had been given seats that
were close to being outside of Pauley Pavilion,
they appeared on the verge of revolutionary
action.
The angry Band wasted little time in
musically destroying the Bruin Band, much to
the delight of many of the UCLA students in
attendance. There was little doubt that a large
number of those students preferred the
progressiveness of the Incomparables to the
Guy Lombardon arrangements of their own
band.
Some Bandsmen almost lit victory cigars
when the Cardinals jumped out to a surprising
early lead, but the matches were quickly
stashed as the inevitable occurred. In a brief
post-game concert, the LSJUMB literally blew
the Bruin Band out of its own pavilion and the
locals were so embarrassed that they didn't
even show up later at a party both bands had
been invited to.
Singles Complex
Unfortunately, hardly anyone else showed
up at the party either. It was supposed to be
some kind of alumni affair and it was held at
one of those singles apartment complexes in
Marina Del Rey where everyone looks like a
Madison Ave. conception of what people who
live in singles apartments should look like.
The Band was treated to a magnificent
dinner of assorted cold cuts and baked beans,
the latter of which went over especially big on
the trip home. After waiting a lengthy period to
see if more than 25 people would show up, the
Band performed briefly and then boarded the
bus for the long trip home. At least the party
yielded a few more signs which the Band could
add to its booty.
Despite the hectic hours in LA, the Band
remained very lively on the trip home. When
the beer ran out,' the bread fights began and
two Bandsmen even lost their pants
momentarily as punishment for assorted high
crimes and misdemeanors.

The dollies, who had stayed at the front of
the bus in collective safety on the way down,
periodically crossed the DMZ (De-Moralized
Zone) on the way home and joined some of
their musical accompaniers in the rear of the
bus. In a rare moment of sober seriousness, a
veteran bandsman commented that these dollies
were probably the most down-to-earth and
friendliest dollies in recent history.
But just when it seemed that the trip would
be remembered mainly as yet another series of
Stanford Band victories, the bus made its move.
The bus achieved its first triumph around 4:15
Sunday morning in the sleepy town of Cilroy, a
southern suburb of Morgan Hill.
*3c Mello Mint'
Gilroy is one of those innumerable central
California towns which make Los Angeles look
like the Garden of Eden by comparison. With
the greatest of finesse, the Edsel crunched to a
stop at an ARCO gas station which included
Cindy's Restaurant, "home of the 3c Mello
Mint."
Cindy's was the last in a long line of truck
stops and greasy spoons that marred the trip.
Typical of their approach was the use of
Pennz.oil and vinegar for salad dressing. It made
you awfully hungry for even dorm food.

Soon after the heartiest of the hearty had
slid a final truck stop meal into their well-oiled
stomachs, the pickup with the diesel fuel
arrived and the Edsel was on the road again.
But not for long.
Fifty miles and one hour later, the Edsel
again finished off its load and came screeching
to a halt two miles east of campus on
Embarcadero Road. And this time there was no
truck stop in sight.
A few of the Incomparables hoofed it home,
but the majority passed the time waiting for a
replacement bus by telling jokes about the
driver's hair cut. Some suggested that an
emergency drop-out window be tested while
the driver was standing under it. That
suggestioned failed narrowly in a voice vote.
Thirty minutes later the Edsel was replaced by
a new improved model which trucked the
merry musicmakers back to the Shak just as the
Sunday sun was rising over Encina Hall.
The LA weekend was finally over and
neither the City of Angels nor this reporter
would ever be the same again. When they turn
me away at the Gates of Heaven some day, 111
look back and blame the Stanford Band. But it
will have been a hell of a lot of fun while it
lasted.

SIGN IN PLEASE — Next time you're hit by a truck while driving the wrong way on a freeway
off-ramp, remember that the missing Do Not Enter sign is probably hanging in the Band Shak.
On last weekend's Los Angeles trip, the Red Vesters made numerous additions to their already
healthy supply of signs. Most notable among their thefts was a bullet-proof glass covered,
R odium-mounted map of ihe Mariner's Village singles apartment complex in Marina Del Rey.
umerous grand jury indictments are expected to be announced soon in that case.
Few things in the world can stop the
Stanford Band. Police departments, irate
alumni and other college bands have never had
much success dealing with the LSJUMB. But
last weekend the Incomparables met their
match.
Where countless others have tried and failed,
a rapidly decaying Edsel Trailways bus
succeeded. With a driver even Jack Webb
would've been proud of at the controls, this
chartered marvel twice in one night destroyed
the best laid plans of America's most
outrageous college band.
Somehow, running out of gas twice seemed a
fitting climax to the Band's annual Los Angeles
trip, which had begun innocently enough 57
hours earlier.
Around 10 p.m. last Thursday night, an
apparent cross section of male Stanford
students could be seen boarding the green and
silver charter in front of the Band Shak. Things

JOLLY DOLLY — Stephanie Jubina models her

Saturday's UCLA-Stanford game. Jubina and

seemed fairly calm and I thought I might even
get some studying done on the trip. That myth
lasted about two minutes.
Before the Edsel was even started up for the
first time, busdriver L.L. Lewis, who reminds
one vividly of the Three Stooges' Curly, laid
down some ground rules. He said he didn't
want any emergency windows pushed out onto
passing cars and he didn't want any "garbage"
to be smoked on his bus. The applause was not
overwhelming.
So White Lightnin' became an even more
important part of the seven hour trip to LA.
Demon alcohol became especially predominant
in the life of an anonymous Daily reporter, who
was last seen hanging out of a bus window
looking for Kohoutek, on Interstate 5 near
Coalinga.
Insane Establishment
The tranquility of the Sunset Strip
Continental Hyatt House was rudely shattered
at 5 a.m. Friday morning as 45 drunk and tired
bandsmen, one bandswoman, five sober and
tired dollies and one pale Daily reporter
stumbled into the only non-Skid Row
establishment insane enough to allow them.
When you go to bed at 6 a.m., time certainly
flies by and soon the Red Vesters and dollies
were on their way to the world famous Busch
Gardens. The crowd awaiting the music men
was not exactly massive. But not wanting to
forfeit a chance for free beer, the Band
entertained 37 customers, 14 employees and
128 birds for 45 minutes before descending on
the kegs that made Anheuser famous.
Friday afternoon belched by quickly and
after surviving another ride on LA's freeways,
the Band invaded Phillipes, where "the elite
meet to eat pickled pigs' feet."
Phillipes also features French Dip
sandwiches, a Geritol-set clientele, a 5c cup of
coffee and a healthy portion of sawdust spread
all over the floor. Although someone suggested
that the sawdust was a Euell Gibbons leftover,
it was more likely that it was a precautionary
measure for the Band's visit. The Incomparables
quickly devoured everything in sight and then
loaded their bottles under their arms and
headed for the Sports Arena.

The Saturday afternoon leg of the journey
didn't get off to a roaring start. After giving a
play-by-play account of his thrilling Friday
night activities, bus driver "Skinhead" Lewis
discovered that his solid plastic name plate was
missing from its perch above his seat. Like a kid
without his Maypo, he made it clear that unless
his identity was restored, it would be a long
walk to UCLA.
The thief quickly returned the name plate
and soon the bus crunched into Westwood.
Getting out of bed for an afternoon game
hadn't gone over real big and when the Red
Vests discovered they had been given seats that
were close to being outside of Pauley Pavilion,
they appeared on the verge of revolutionary
action.
The angry Band wasted little time in
musically destroying the Bruin Band, much to
the delight of many of the UCLA students in
attendance. There was little doubt that a large
number of those students preferred the
progressiveness of the Incomparables to the
Guy Lombardon arrangements of their own
band.
Some Bandsmen almost lit victory cigars
when the Cardinals jumped out to a surprising
early lead, but the matches were quickly
stashed as the inevitable occurred. In a brief
post-game concert, the LSJUMB literally blew
the Bruin Band out of its own pavilion and the
locals were so embarrassed that they didn't
even show up later at a party both bands had
been invited to.
Singles Complex
Unfortunately, hardly anyone else showed
up at the party either. It was supposed to be
some kind of alumni affair and it was held at
one of those singles apartment complexes in
Marina Del Rey where everyone looks like a
Madison Ave. conception of what people who
live in singles apartments should look like.
The Band was treated to a magnificent
dinner of assorted cold cuts and baked beans,
the latter of which went over especially big on
the trip home. After waiting a lengthy period to
see if more than 25 people would show up, the
Band performed briefly and then boarded the
bus for the long trip home. At least the party
yielded a few more signs which the Band could
add to its booty.
Despite the hectic hours in LA, the Band
remained very lively on the trip home. When
the beer ran out,' the bread fights began and
two Bandsmen even lost their pants
momentarily as punishment for assorted high
crimes and misdemeanors.

The dollies, who had stayed at the front of
the bus in collective safety on the way down,
periodically crossed the DMZ (De-Moralized
Zone) on the way home and joined some of
their musical accompaniers in the rear of the
bus. In a rare moment of sober seriousness, a
veteran bandsman commented that these dollies
were probably the most down-to-earth and
friendliest dollies in recent history.
But just when it seemed that the trip would
be remembered mainly as yet another series of
Stanford Band victories, the bus made its move.
The bus achieved its first triumph around 4:15
Sunday morning in the sleepy town of Cilroy, a
southern suburb of Morgan Hill.
*3c Mello Mint'
Gilroy is one of those innumerable central
California towns which make Los Angeles look
like the Garden of Eden by comparison. With
the greatest of finesse, the Edsel crunched to a
stop at an ARCO gas station which included
Cindy's Restaurant, "home of the 3c Mello
Mint."
Cindy's was the last in a long line of truck
stops and greasy spoons that marred the trip.
Typical of their approach was the use of
Pennz.oil and vinegar for salad dressing. It made
you awfully hungry for even dorm food.

Soon after the heartiest of the hearty had
slid a final truck stop meal into their well-oiled
stomachs, the pickup with the diesel fuel
arrived and the Edsel was on the road again.
But not for long.
Fifty miles and one hour later, the Edsel
again finished off its load and came screeching
to a halt two miles east of campus on
Embarcadero Road. And this time there was no
truck stop in sight.
A few of the Incomparables hoofed it home,
but the majority passed the time waiting for a
replacement bus by telling jokes about the
driver's hair cut. Some suggested that an
emergency drop-out window be tested while
the driver was standing under it. That
suggestioned failed narrowly in a voice vote.
Thirty minutes later the Edsel was replaced by
a new improved model which trucked the
merry musicmakers back to the Shak just as the
Sunday sun was rising over Encina Hall.
The LA weekend was finally over and
neither the City of Angels nor this reporter
would ever be the same again. When they turn
me away at the Gates of Heaven some day, 111
look back and blame the Stanford Band. But it
will have been a hell of a lot of fun while it
lasted.

SIGN IN PLEASE — Next time you're hit by a truck while driving the wrong way on a freeway
off-ramp, remember that the missing Do Not Enter sign is probably hanging in the Band Shak.
On last weekend's Los Angeles trip, the Red Vesters made numerous additions to their already
healthy supply of signs. Most notable among their thefts was a bullet-proof glass covered,
R odium-mounted map of ihe Mariner's Village singles apartment complex in Marina Del Rey.
umerous grand jury indictments are expected to be announced soon in that case.
Few things in the world can stop the
Stanford Band. Police departments, irate
alumni and other college bands have never had
much success dealing with the LSJUMB. But
last weekend the Incomparables met their
match.
Where countless others have tried and failed,
a rapidly decaying Edsel Trailways bus
succeeded. With a driver even Jack Webb
would've been proud of at the controls, this
chartered marvel twice in one night destroyed
the best laid plans of America's most
outrageous college band.
Somehow, running out of gas twice seemed a
fitting climax to the Band's annual Los Angeles
trip, which had begun innocently enough 57
hours earlier.
Around 10 p.m. last Thursday night, an
apparent cross section of male Stanford
students could be seen boarding the green and
silver charter in front of the Band Shak. Things

JOLLY DOLLY — Stephanie Jubina models her
new earrings in Pauley Pavilion before last
Saturday's UCLA-Stanford game. Jubina and
her fellow dollies danced up a storm all
weekend, but still had enough energy on the
return trip to venture into the back-of-the-bus
jungle where the wildest of the bandsmen hung
out. Three dollies are still reported missing.

seemed fairly calm and I thought I might even
get some studying done on the trip. That myth
lasted about two minutes.
Before the Edsel was even started up for the
first time, busdriver L.L. Lewis, who reminds
one vividly of the Three Stooges' Curly, laid
down some ground rules. He said he didn't
want any emergency windows pushed out onto
passing cars and he didn't want any "garbage"
to be smoked on his bus. The applause was not
overwhelming.
So White Lightnin' became an even more
important part of the seven hour trip to LA.
Demon alcohol became especially predominant
in the life of an anonymous Daily reporter, who
was last seen hanging out of a bus window
looking for Kohoutek, on Interstate 5 near
Coalinga.
Insane Establishment
The tranquility of the Sunset Strip
Continental Hyatt House was rudely shattered
at 5 a.m. Friday morning as 45 drunk and tired
bandsmen, one bandswoman, five sober and
tired dollies and one pale Daily reporter
stumbled into the only non-Skid Row
establishment insane enough to allow them.
When you go to bed at 6 a.m., time certainly
flies by and soon the Red Vesters and dollies
were on their way to the world famous Busch
Gardens. The crowd awaiting the music men
was not exactly massive. But not wanting to
forfeit a chance for free beer, the Band
entertained 37 customers, 14 employees and
128 birds for 45 minutes before descending on
the kegs that made Anheuser famous.
Friday afternoon belched by quickly and
after surviving another ride on LA's freeways,
the Band invaded Phillipes, where "the elite
meet to eat pickled pigs' feet."
Phillipes also features French Dip
sandwiches, a Geritol-set clientele, a 5c cup of
coffee and a healthy portion of sawdust spread
all over the floor. Although someone suggested
that the sawdust was a Euell Gibbons leftover,
it was more likely that it was a precautionary
measure for the Band's visit. The Incomparables
quickly devoured everything in sight and then
loaded their bottles under their arms and
headed for the Sports Arena.
Secret Game Plan
The Band is traditionally the only Stanford
victor on these LA basketball trips, but once
again Howie Dallmar ignored the Band's
strategic advice and ended up with two losses to
show for it. In their trip itinerary, the Red
Vesters revealed their top-secret USC game plan
— "Howie locks himself in locker room and the
team scores an upset victory." Despite the
Band's pleadings, neither event occurred on
Friday night.
But the Incomparables did win the annual
Battle of the Bands with their southern rivals,
the USC "Weenies." Despite having twice as
many musicians, the Trojan noisemakers still
sounded like a poor recording of their Palo Alto
counterparts.
In all fairness, the USC Band should be
commended for attempting to join Stanford in
an exodus from the musical Dark Ages most
college bands still inhabit. USC Band Manager
Art Bartner admits that Stanford has had an
influence on his group and the fact that the

Trojans are trying to follow the footsteps of the
Red Vesters is an obvious compliment.
Unfortunately, the shoes still don't fit quite
yet.
After a quick return trip to the Strip, the
Red Vesters split up to follow their individual
fetishes. Some Bandspeople and the dollies
partied, while other Red Vesters tried to break
into pornographic news racks on the Strip. But
the hottest action occurred in Room 307 where
a motley crew viewed the UCLA-Cal game
replay, roller derby and"The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." A good time was had by all.

live in singles apartments should look like.
The Band was treated to a magnificent
dinner of assorted cold cuts and baked beans,
the latter of which went over especially big on
the trip home. After waiting a lengthy period to
see if more than 25 people would show up, the
Band performed briefly and then boarded the
bus for the long trip home. At least the party
yielded a few more signs which the Band could
add to its booty.
Despite the hectic hours in LA, the Band
remained very lively on the trip home. When
the beer ran out,' the bread fights began and
two Bandsmen even lost their pants
momentarily as punishment for assorted high
crimes and misdemeanors.

The dollies, who had stayed at the front of
the bus in collective safety on the way down,
periodically crossed the DMZ (De-Moralized
Zone) on the way home and joined some of
their musical accompaniers in the rear of the
bus. In a rare moment of sober seriousness, a
veteran bandsman commented that these dollies
were probably the most down-to-earth and
friendliest dollies in recent history.
But just when it seemed that the trip would
be remembered mainly as yet another series of
Stanford Band victories, the bus made its move.
The bus achieved its first triumph around 4:15
Sunday morning in the sleepy town of Cilroy, a
southern suburb of Morgan Hill.
*3c Mello Mint'
Gilroy is one of those innumerable central
California towns which make Los Angeles look
like the Garden of Eden by comparison. With
the greatest of finesse, the Edsel crunched to a
stop at an ARCO gas station which included
Cindy's Restaurant, "home of the 3c Mello
Mint."
Cindy's was the last in a long line of truck
stops and greasy spoons that marred the trip.
Typical of their approach was the use of
Pennz.oil and vinegar for salad dressing. It made
you awfully hungry for even dorm food.

Soon after the heartiest of the hearty had
slid a final truck stop meal into their well-oiled
stomachs, the pickup with the diesel fuel
arrived and the Edsel was on the road again.
But not for long.
Fifty miles and one hour later, the Edsel
again finished off its load and came screeching
to a halt two miles east of campus on
Embarcadero Road. And this time there was no
truck stop in sight.
A few of the Incomparables hoofed it home,
but the majority passed the time waiting for a
replacement bus by telling jokes about the
driver's hair cut. Some suggested that an
emergency drop-out window be tested while
the driver was standing under it. That
suggestioned failed narrowly in a voice vote.
Thirty minutes later the Edsel was replaced by
a new improved model which trucked the
merry musicmakers back to the Shak just as the
Sunday sun was rising over Encina Hall.
The LA weekend was finally over and
neither the City of Angels nor this reporter
would ever be the same again. When they turn
me away at the Gates of Heaven some day, 111
look back and blame the Stanford Band. But it
will have been a hell of a lot of fun while it
lasted.

SIGN IN PLEASE — Next time you're hit by a truck while driving the wrong way on a freeway
off-ramp, remember that the missing Do Not Enter sign is probably hanging in the Band Shak.
On last weekend's Los Angeles trip, the Red Vesters made numerous additions to their already
healthy supply of signs. Most notable among their thefts was a bullet-proof glass covered,
R odium-mounted map of ihe Mariner's Village singles apartment complex in Marina Del Rey.
umerous grand jury indictments are expected to be announced soon in that case.
Few things in the world can stop the
Stanford Band. Police departments, irate
alumni and other college bands have never had
much success dealing with the LSJUMB. But
last weekend the Incomparables met their
match.
Where countless others have tried and failed,
a rapidly decaying Edsel Trailways bus
succeeded. With a driver even Jack Webb
would've been proud of at the controls, this
chartered marvel twice in one night destroyed
the best laid plans of America's most
outrageous college band.
Somehow, running out of gas twice seemed a
fitting climax to the Band's annual Los Angeles
trip, which had begun innocently enough 57
hours earlier.
Around 10 p.m. last Thursday night, an
apparent cross section of male Stanford
students could be seen boarding the green and
silver charter in front of the Band Shak. Things

JOLLY DOLLY — Stephanie Jubina models her
new earrings in Pauley Pavilion before last
Saturday's UCLA-Stanford game. Jubina and
her fellow dollies danced up a storm all
weekend, but still had enough energy on the
return trip to venture into the back-of-the-bus
jungle where the wildest of the bandsmen hung
out. Three dollies are still reported missing.

seemed fairly calm and I thought I might even
get some studying done on the trip. That myth
lasted about two minutes.
Before the Edsel was even started up for the
first time, busdriver L.L. Lewis, who reminds
one vividly of the Three Stooges' Curly, laid
down some ground rules. He said he didn't
want any emergency windows pushed out onto
passing cars and he didn't want any "garbage"
to be smoked on his bus. The applause was not
overwhelming.
So White Lightnin' became an even more
important part of the seven hour trip to LA.
Demon alcohol became especially predominant
in the life of an anonymous Daily reporter, who
was last seen hanging out of a bus window
looking for Kohoutek, on Interstate 5 near
Coalinga.
Insane Establishment
The tranquility of the Sunset Strip
Continental Hyatt House was rudely shattered
at 5 a.m. Friday morning as 45 drunk and tired
bandsmen, one bandswoman, five sober and
tired dollies and one pale Daily reporter
stumbled into the only non-Skid Row
establishment insane enough to allow them.
When you go to bed at 6 a.m., time certainly
flies by and soon the Red Vesters and dollies
were on their way to the world famous Busch
Gardens. The crowd awaiting the music men
was not exactly massive. But not wanting to
forfeit a chance for free beer, the Band
entertained 37 customers, 14 employees and
128 birds for 45 minutes before descending on
the kegs that made Anheuser famous.
Friday afternoon belched by quickly and
after surviving another ride on LA's freeways,
the Band invaded Phillipes, where "the elite
meet to eat pickled pigs' feet."
Phillipes also features French Dip
sandwiches, a Geritol-set clientele, a 5c cup of
coffee and a healthy portion of sawdust spread
all over the floor. Although someone suggested
that the sawdust was a Euell Gibbons leftover,
it was more likely that it was a precautionary
measure for the Band's visit. The Incomparables
quickly devoured everything in sight and then
loaded their bottles under their arms and
headed for the Sports Arena.
Secret Game Plan
The Band is traditionally the only Stanford
victor on these LA basketball trips, but once
again Howie Dallmar ignored the Band's
strategic advice and ended up with two losses to
show for it. In their trip itinerary, the Red
Vesters revealed their top-secret USC game plan
— "Howie locks himself in locker room and the
team scores an upset victory." Despite the
Band's pleadings, neither event occurred on
Friday night.
But the Incomparables did win the annual
Battle of the Bands with their southern rivals,
the USC "Weenies." Despite having twice as
many musicians, the Trojan noisemakers still
sounded like a poor recording of their Palo Alto
counterparts.
In all fairness, the USC Band should be
commended for attempting to join Stanford in
an exodus from the musical Dark Ages most
college bands still inhabit. USC Band Manager
Art Bartner admits that Stanford has had an
influence on his group and the fact that the

Trojans are trying to follow the footsteps of the
Red Vesters is an obvious compliment.
Unfortunately, the shoes still don't fit quite
yet.
After a quick return trip to the Strip, the
Red Vesters split up to follow their individual
fetishes. Some Bandspeople and the dollies
partied, while other Red Vesters tried to break
into pornographic news racks on the Strip. But
the hottest action occurred in Room 307 where
a motley crew viewed the UCLA-Cal game
replay, roller derby and"The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." A good time was had by all.
'Skinhead'
The Saturday afternoon leg of the journey
didn't get off to a roaring start. After giving a
play-by-play account of his thrilling Friday
night activities, bus driver "Skinhead" Lewis
discovered that his solid plastic name plate was
missing from its perch above his seat. Like a kid
without his Maypo, he made it clear that unless
his identity was restored, it would be a long
walk to UCLA.
The thief quickly returned the name plate
and soon the bus crunched into Westwood.
Getting out of bed for an afternoon game
hadn't gone over real big and when the Red
Vests discovered they had been given seats that
were close to being outside of Pauley Pavilion,
they appeared on the verge of revolutionary
action.
The angry Band wasted little time in
musically destroying the Bruin Band, much to
the delight of many of the UCLA students in
attendance. There was little doubt that a large
number of those students preferred the
progressiveness of the Incomparables to the
Guy Lombardon arrangements of their own
band.
Some Bandsmen almost lit victory cigars
when the Cardinals jumped out to a surprising
early lead, but the matches were quickly
stashed as the inevitable occurred. In a brief
post-game concert, the LSJUMB literally blew
the Bruin Band out of its own pavilion and the
locals were so embarrassed that they didn't
even show up later at a party both bands had
been invited to.
Singles Complex
Unfortunately, hardly anyone else showed
up at the party either. It was supposed to be
some kind of alumni affair and it was held at
one of those singles apartment complexes in
Marina Del Rey where everyone looks like a
Madison Ave. conception of what people who
live in singles apartments should look like.
The Band was treated to a magnificent
