Ford Defends Nixon
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Testimony that one of the
Watergate tapes was erased and rerecorded is not sufficient
grounds to impeach President Nixon, Vice President Gerald
R. Ford said yesterday.
"I don't think what has happened so far is a justifiable
action under the definition of impeachment under the
Constitution," Ford told a news conference in his home
town.
"It's too serious a charge to go from that testimony to
an automatic vote for impeachment," Ford added.
"I think it's premature to jump in on the testimony of
six witnesses, who may or may not be upheld, and call for
impeachment," Ford said.
The President's personal lawyer in the tapes controversy
will present rebuttal testimony in a hearing today in an
effort to show the erasures were not deliberate.
Ford said that despite the latest tapes controversy, he
would not change the wording of his Atlantic City speech
Monday in which he charged certain groups, including the
AFL-CIO, with leading the drive to impeach Nixon.
In that speech Ford said the Americans for Democratic
Action — and the AFL-CIO have launched "a well-financed
and skillfully planned program to impeach the
President... in a massive way without the facts."
Packard Endorses Flournoy
SACRAMENTO — Controller Houston I. Flournoy won
the endorsement of former Undersecretary of Defense
David Packard for his Republican gubernatorial campaign
Thursday.
Packard, chairman of the board of Hewlett-Packard Co.
and former president of Stanford's Board of Trustees, will
form a Flournoy-for-Governor citizen's committee, the
Flournoy campaign announced in a statement.
Packard has been a major supporter of Gov. Ronald
Reagan and was a heavy contributor to Reagan's tax
control election campaign last fall.
He was identified earlier as one of those who tried
unsuccessfully to talk Caspar W. Weinberger, secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare, into running for governor.
Packard once was mentioned as a potential gubernatorial
candidate himself.
The June primary now is expected to be a two-way
contest between Flournoy and Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke.
Packard said he will head a broad-based citizen's
committee for Flournoy.
"I'm convinced that in the political climate of 1974, he
has the best chance of winning and that if elected, he will
be an excellent governor," Packard said.
Brian Resigns Cabinet Post
SACRAMENTO — Earl Brian Jr. resigned yesterday as
Gov. Ronald Reagan's Cabinet chief for health and welfare.
Brian, a Republican, said he will run for public office,
expected to be the U.S. Senate.
Brian, 31, has been considered one of the most
influential men in the Reagan administration, running an
agency with a budget of more than $6 billion annually.
Brian has been expected to seek the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate in June. The seat is held by
Democrat Alan Cranston, who is running for re-election.
In his letter of resignation, Brian told Reagan: "I now
feel that I should turn my full energy to the pursuit of
elected office so that I may expand that role in serving the
people of this state."
Brian joined the Reagan administration four years ago as
head of the Medi-Cal program of state health care for the
poor. He rose to the cabinet-level post two years ago.
Brian was chosen recently as one of the nation's 10
outstanding young men by the U.S. Junior Chamber of
Commerce.
When the announcement of his resignation was made,
Brian was en route to Mobile, Ala. to accept the award.
Reagan Declares Disaster
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan declared four
flood-stricken Northern California counties a disaster area
yesterday as new storms headed for the area in which flood
waters had caused millions of dollars damage and at least
four deaths.
Four other Western states also hit by storms began
cleaning up yesterday from flooding and other bad weather
that killed upward of a dozen people, but faced the forecast
of more rain and snow again today.

In Oregon, geologists probed at a mountain of cascaded
mud in hopes of finding six men still missing after a
landslide buried nine workers. Three bodies were recovered.
A frontal system gathering over the Pacific Ocean could
hit the flooded Pacific Coast and Northwest by early
morning, the National Weather Service warned.
The bodies of three of nine men buried in an earthslide
Wednesday near Canyonville, Ore., were found in Canyon
Creek, about a mile downstream from the slide.
Arabs Blame Oil Pinch On Israel
BONN, Germany — Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yanami of
Saudi Arabia said yesterday that Israel is responsible for the
oil squeeze. He said his nation will not increase oil
production until Israeli forces vacate all Arab territories
occupied in the 1967 war.
In an interview on German television, he added: "There
will never be peace in the Mideast until the Palestinian
question is solved." The Arabs demand restoration of the
rights of Palestinians displaced when the state of Israel was
created 25 years ago.
Earlier yesterday, Yamani said the Arab world would
welcome President Nixon's energy initiative if its aim is true
cooperation between oil consuming and producing nations.
But he said he would oppose the Nixon plan for a
Washington conference of key oil consumers and later talks
with oil producers if the purpose is to form a bloc of
consumer states against producers. Those remarks came at a
news conference as Yamani wound up a three-day visit
here.
Yamani asserted that Israel's "aggression and politics of
annexation" were responsible for Arab measures that
resulted in the oil pinch.
Energy Reporting Challenged
WASHINGTON — Consumer advocate Ralph Nader and
a Federal Trade Commission official yesterday challenged
the credibility of energy data published by oil and gas
companies.
Testifying before a House subcommittee, Nader said oil
reserve figures published by the American Petroleum
Institute were "utterly phony."
James T. Halverson, director of the Federal Trade
Commission's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement
that an investigation of natural gas reserve reporting
practices revealed an apparent "serious under-reporting" by
producers.
Halverson, who stressed that he was speaking for himself
and not the FTC, said "there is no independent check" by
government agencies on the accuracy of figures supplied by
the energy industry. Nader flatly accused the agencies,
excluding the FTC, of "a uniform desire not to know the
facts."
Federal Power Commission chairman John N. Nassikas
told the subcommittee on regulatory agencies that an
investigation by his staff of the nation's gas reserves
included independent field audits of "basic raw data," but
Halverson said "the sample was small, and its sampling
questionable."
Nassikas pointed out, however, that his staff found that
the American Gas Association had omitted 62 gas fields
from the list of reserves it gave to the FPC.
Ten Cities To Get Least Gas?
WASHINGTON — The Federal Energy Office named 10
metropolitan areas yesterday whose licensed drivers
probably would get the lowest gasoline rations under the
administration's proposed rationing plan. San
Francisco-Oakland was included.
Drivers in these areas might, for example, be limited to
33 gallons per month when gasoline supplies are tight,
possibly increasing to around 40 gallons per month, when
supplies ease up a bit.
A listing by the FEO showed the following areas in the
category to get 20 percent less gasoline than the nationwide
standard:
Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Chicago and suburban Des
Plaines, Evanston and Gary; Milwaukee; New York and
Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; San Francisco-Oakland; New
Orleans; and Honolulu.
Eight other metropolitan areas were considered in a
category which would receive 10 percent less gasoline than
the nationwide standard under the proposed plan.
Drivers might be limited to 37 to 44 gallons per month
in: Buffalo, N.Y.; Cleveland and Shaker Heights; Miami,
Fla.; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Washington,

D.C.; Savannah, Ga.; and Charlotte, N.C.
Economic Growth Slows
WASHINGTON — The government reported yesterday
that economic growth slowed sharply in the last three
months of 1973, but inflation continued to worsen and Was
at the highest rate in 22 years.
Economic growth — as measured by the Gross National
Product — was a slight 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter,
down from 3.4 percent in the third quarter. Economic
growth for all of 1973 was 5.9 percent.
The fourth quarter rate of inflation was 7.9 percent, the
worst inflation rate since the 13 percent registered in the
first quarter of 1951. It was seven percent in the third
quarter of last year.
Producers Hoard Natural Gas
WASHINGTON — Evidence in the files of the Federal
Power Commission indicates that some natural gas
producers in the United States have tried to buy up
available reserves, intending to keep the gas off the market
and await higher prices.
At an otherwise routine rate hearing several months ago,
an independent gas producer testified that he had been
approached by a number of other companies that sought, to
buy his reserves to hold in the ground.
The producer, Douglas L. Bendell of Wichita, Kan., told
the FPC that the other producers, some of them major oil
companies, had said they were willing "to bet on the come"
— to gamble that if they held off producing the gas for
several years it would be worth a great deal more money.
Bendell, an executive of the Okmar Oil Co., did not
disclose the names of the other producers to the FPC and
declined to do so when contacted by telephone at his
Wichita office.
"It's competitive information," he said in an interview.

"If I disclosed the names these people would have reason to
suspect I can't keep a business confidence and they might
be reluctant to continue doing business with me."
Bendell said he went before the FPC last July because he
wanted to sell his gas to an interstate pipeline at the rate of
49 cents per thousand cubic feet, more than twice the
ceiling price of 21 cents set by the FPC.
Storm Rips English Channel
DOVER, England — An English Channel storm with
50-foot waves and 100-mile-an-hour winds killed 31 persons
yesterday and left five others missing, authorities said.
It was the Channel's worst storm in 20 years.
Searchers recovered the bodies of 16 crewmen who had
abandoned the Cypriot freighter Prosperity. The 2088-ton
ship ran aground on a reef near Guernsey, one of the
Channel Islands.
Two of the Prosperity's crew were still missing. Earlier
reports said a total of 20 crewmen had abandoned ship.
The Danish freighter Merc Enterprise sank off the
south-west England coast, taking the lives of five persons
and leaving three missing. Four of 11 survivors from the
781-ton ship were picked up by the Soviet trawler
Leningrad. Helicopters rescued the others.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness with rain likely today continuing
at times tonight. Partly cloudy with chance of showers
tomorrow. Low tonight mid 40s to low 50s. High both days
upper 50s to mid 60s. Light wind increasing to 15 to 30
mph today. Chance of rain 70 percent today and 70
