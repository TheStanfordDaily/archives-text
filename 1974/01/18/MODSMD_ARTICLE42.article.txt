The separation of Israeli and
Egyptian forces at the Suez Canal
"may lead to some easing of the Arab
oil embargo â€” it won't mean the end
of the embargo," Dr. George S. Rentz,
curator of the Middle East Collection
in the Hoover Institution declared last
night.
"The Arab oil producing countries
have made it clear the embargo will
remain in effect until the Israelis
comply with U.N. Resolution 242 of
July 1967 which calls for withdrawal
of Israel from occupied territory,"
Rentz said.
Rentz told a gathering of about 75
people, who had come to Tresidder
Memorial Union to hear about "The
Persian Gulf and World Energy," that

not all Arab leaders had a history of
favoring the use of oil as a political
weapon. King Faisal of Saudi Arabia
had been "an outstanding example" of
an opponent to such a policy, Rentz
said.
"Up until a year ago," Rentz noted,
"King Faisal openly, publicly opposed
use of oil as a political weapon."
However, Israel's continued
occupation of Arab lands and her
attempts to "nail down" her hold on
these lands by building military and
para-military bases forced Faisal to
reconsider his position, Rentz said.
Nonetheless, Faisal continued to
oppose an oil embargo against the
United States, even after the outbreak
of the October War, according to
Rentz. It was only after Faisal received
word that President Nixon was going
to request $2.2 billion in aid for Israel
that he changed his mind, Rentz said.
Rentz discredited references to
Arab oil policy as "blackmail or
extortion. We would do exactly the
same if we were in their place," Rentz
said. "It's just smart business."
According to Rentz, the current oil
prices are "based on market price and

are not exorbitant." Up to now, oil
was underpriced, Rentz stated.
Referring to the shortage of
available fuel in the United States,
Rentz commented, "I don't think it
really is a crisis. Just look at Britain if
you want to see a crisis."
Rentz added that the Arab oil
producing countries were only
partially responsible for the current
U.S. shortage. "The United States
would suffer a shortage anyway
without an embargo," Rentz* said,
"because of insufficient refinery
capacity."
The Middle East expert concluded
that "the whole experience [of a U.S.
fuel shortage] may be good in the long
run. If we had continued to expand
our economy on the basis of cheap
energy, the day would have come
when we would have had absolute
disaster," Rentz said.

added that he "would not anticipate
any further action" on the part of the
University.
Zohn Artman, one of the
promoters of the Dylan concert,
summed up thy position of music fans
and the music industry. He called
scalping of tickets "unethical," adding,
"it's stooping pretty low to take
advantage of someone's love of a great
poet" by overcharging for tickets
which are in scarce supply.
