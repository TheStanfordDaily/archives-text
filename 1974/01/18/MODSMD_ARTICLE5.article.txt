# Dylan Ticket Scalping Raises Legal Doubts
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Someone, presumably a student,
has come up with an ingenious and
elaborate way to make money.
However, it may be illegal.
Yesterday morning, leaflets
appeared on the kiosks around White
Plaza advertising tickets to the
sold-out concert featuring Bob Dylan
and The Band to be held Feb. 11 at
the Oakland Coliseum Arena. The ads
solicited bids for two tickets which
would be "sold together or separately
to the highest bidder(s)" at a
minimum bid of $20 each. The
original price for seats was $6.50 to
$8.50.
The bids were to be sent to a post
office box at the campus branch after
which the entrepreneur would contact

the high bidders.
Yesterday afternoon a former
student, who called the bidding
scheme "illegal" and "unethical," filed
a complaint with the Stanford
Department of Public Safety. Director
Marvin Herrington, when informed of
the complaint, said that no action
would be taken immediately except to
examine the possible illegality of the
offer.
'Nothing Illegal'
Allen Ruby of the Legal Counseling
Office could find nothing inherently
illegal in scalping tickets in this
fashion. Section 346 of the California
Penal Code states that it is a
misdemeanor to resell tickets at a
higher-than-original cost "while on the
grounds of or in the stadium, arena,
theater, or other place" where an
event is held.
Apparently, scalping at a distance
from the site does not violate the
Penal Code. Attorney Robert
Harpainter of the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office agreed that
there was probably no case for
prosecution based on the Penal Code.
Both Harpainter and Ruby left open
the possibility of violations of the
Business and Professions or Revenue
and Taxation Codes.
The scalper may possibly be in
violation of Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulations. Federal excise tax is
normally charged on all ticket sales.
Whether or not resale of tickets for
profit incurs a further tax liability is
unclear. IRS Excise Tax Dept. officials
were unavailable for comment.
Postal Jurisdiction?
The U.S. Postal Service may also
have jurisdiction in this matter.
According to Harold Starr,
superintendent of the main Palo Alto
post office, use of a post office box
for illegal business ventures is a
violation of Postal Service regulations.
The Fraud Section of the Postal
Inspector's office in San Francisco
indicated interest in the ticket auction
scheme, and asked for further
information to determine if an
investigation is in order.
Tom Bachetti, director of the
Office of Public Events, has stated
"Advertisement of personal items for
sale" is specifically prohibited.

Postal Jurisdiction?
The U.S. Postal Service may also
have jurisdiction in this matter.
According to Harold Starr,
superintendent of the main Palo Alto
post office, use of a post office box
for illegal business ventures is a
violation of Postal Service regulations.
The Fraud Section of the Postal
Inspector's office in San Francisco
indicated interest in the ticket auction
scheme, and asked for further
information to determine if an
investigation is in order.
Tom Bachetti, director of the
Office of Public Events, has stated
"Advertisement of personal items for
sale" is specifically prohibited.

Someone, presumably a student,
has come up with an ingenious and
elaborate way to make money.
However, it may be illegal.
Yesterday morning, leaflets
appeared on the kiosks around White
Plaza advertising tickets to the
sold-out concert featuring Bob Dylan
and The Band to be held Feb. 11 at
the Oakland Coliseum Arena. The ads
solicited bids for two tickets which
would be "sold together or separately
to the highest bidder(s)" at a
minimum bid of $20 each. The
original price for seats was $6.50 to
$8.50.
The bids were to be sent to a post
office box at the campus branch after
which the entrepreneur would contact

the high bidders.
Yesterday afternoon a former
student, who called the bidding
scheme "illegal" and "unethical," filed
a complaint with the Stanford
Department of Public Safety. Director
Marvin Herrington, when informed of
the complaint, said that no action
would be taken immediately except to
examine the possible illegality of the
offer.
'Nothing Illegal'
Allen Ruby of the Legal Counseling
Office could find nothing inherently
illegal in scalping tickets in this
fashion. Section 346 of the California
Penal Code states that it is a
misdemeanor to resell tickets at a
higher-than-original cost "while on the
grounds of or in the stadium, arena,
theater, or other place" where an
event is held.
Apparently, scalping at a distance
from the site does not violate the
Penal Code. Attorney Robert
Harpainter of the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office agreed that
there was probably no case for
prosecution based on the Penal Code.
Both Harpainter and Ruby left open
the possibility of violations of the
Business and Professions or Revenue
and Taxation Codes.
The scalper may possibly be in
violation of Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulations. Federal excise tax is
normally charged on all ticket sales.
Whether or not resale of tickets for
profit incurs a further tax liability is
unclear. IRS Excise Tax Dept. officials
were unavailable for comment.
