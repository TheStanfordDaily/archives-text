## ROTC: R.I.P. 
### 
We commend the action of the Faculty Senate last week in
postponing indefinitely consideration of a reinstatement of ROTC on
this campus.
Had the Senate taken up the various proposals for the revival of
organized military training on this campus, it would have found itself
in the curious position of considering a program ostensibly for the
benefit of students — but in which there is precious little student
interest and no discernible student enthusiasm.
More important, ROTC was "terminated" here only after
exhaustive inquiry and debate. The considerations that brought the
faculty to that action were more than transient. The question of
whether a fundamental conflict exists between military pursuits and
academic goals remains central to the problem.
We believe such a conflict exists.
We believe that no program of military training has yet been
devised, on this campus or any other, that is not incompatible with
the goals and methods of the University's academic program.
One of the explicit aims of military training on the American
campus is to impart military standards of conduct and discipline to
students. This nonacademic aim, inseparable from ROTC's
"academic" program, has sometimes given ROTC an almost
antiacademic cast. In 1966, for example, a small scandal erupted here
when it was discovered that ROTC cadets had been offered higher
academic grades for donating their blood for officers wounded in
Vietnam.
Worse, ROTC participants are subject to military codes of
discipline. They cannot speak out on public issues or attend public
political functions without risking official sanction. Most ROTC
contracts include a "punitive clause," which makes students who
decide to leave the program subject to immediate induction into the
armed forces as enlisted men.
These features are, we believe, fundamentally hostile to Stanford's
better traditions of academic freedom. They are present in some
measure in every ROTC program yet suggested or devised.
It appears to be a feature of the current proposals to place some
of the program's functions under University control and to leave
others under the military's wing. It won't work. The University
cannot sanction student participation in the academic component of
a program, ignore the nonacademic component, and remain true to
itself. If ROTC is to be under University control, it must be entirely
under University control. No such program has been proposed, or is
likely to be proposed.
Any number of arguments, from the exigencies of national
security to the notion of somehow "humanizing" the military, are
likely to be advanced in favor of ROTC. They fail to resolve the
fundamental problem — that of incompatibility of military and
academic aims.
The question of whether any and all military training is inherently
unacceptable has not yet been answered to our satisfaction. But that
global question is, for now, almost irrelevant: no ROTC program
heretofore proposed even approaches reasonable standards of
academic freedom and university control. This is one sleeping dog
the Faculty Senate ought to let lie.
