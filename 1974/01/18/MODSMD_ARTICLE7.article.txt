Cowell Emergency Service
Editor:
The events surrounding the death
of a student on the Stanford campus
December 4th of last year have
prompted several questions concerning
the reaction of Cowell Health Center
to emergencies occurring within a
close proximity.
In this instance, the student
collapsed while playing basketball on
the courts between Stern and Wilbur
Halls. When it was realized the student
needed immediate medical care, the
first response was to send someone to
Cowell to bring a doctor. At Cowell,
the fact that an emergency existed
nearby was made clear to one of the
physicians. However, after a delay of
some duration (over five minutes), the
only response from Cowell was to call
the Stanford Fire Department. This
was also done by a student at the
scene of the emergency using a phone
in Stern Hall.
The Fire Department responded
immediately with a rescue unit.
Shortly thereafter an ambulance was
called and the student was removed to
the Medical Center where he was
pronounced dead on arrival.
Some as-yet-unanswered questions
should be raised. Why didn't personnel
from Cowell respond directly? Why
was there a delay in the call from
Cowell to the Fire Department? Does
this mean Cowell is unequipped to
handle accidents and emergencies and,
if so, is unaware of what procedure to
follow? In short, what assistance can
the Stanford community expect from
Cowell Health Center in time of
nearby emergency? Would it be better
to use the University emergency
number (321-2300, ext. 2313) even in
those instances where a doctor is
within a close distance?
It is hoped that by demanding
answers to the above questions, it will
be made clear just what the
responsibilities of Cowell Health
Center include.

The Daily of Friday, Jan. 11, notes
that "University President Richard
Lyman stopped briefly outside the
[faculty senate] meeting to chat with
a demonstrator about David Starr
Jordan's position on ROTC." Lyman
asked about the source for the
information on a placard that Jordan
had disapproved of ROTC.
It is true that David Starr Jordan,
the first president of Stanford,
opposed the ideas presented in his day
for military instruction or drill at
educational institutions, whether

secondary schools or colleges. Jordan
did not believe that military training
was compatible with general
education.
Jordan's views can be found in the
New York Times for February 25,
1915, and in his book War and the
Breed (Boston: Beacon Press, 1915),
pp. 104-108, 225-229.

ROTC Humanization
Editor:
I am flattered that Larry Diamond
should list me as a faculty member
from whom the "humanely trained"
ROTC students of the future should
take courses while at Stanford.
Unfortunately there is no evidence
that attending elite institutions has
ever had a humanizing effect on either
our civilian or our military leadership.
John F. Kennedy, Dean Rusk, Robert
McNamara, and the Bundy and
Rostow brothers were all trained by
the likes of Professors Brown,
Rhinelander, Lewis and myself, and
once in power planned and executed
the invasion of one small country after
another in the interests of American
imperialism.
The way to protect the world from
American military power is not to
humanize the armed forces but to
change the uses to which they are put.
And that will happen only when we
have a civilian leadership in
Washington that repudiates the cold
war goals and policies of the past
thirty years.

While comet Kohoutek may be less
"the comet of the century" than one
of its disppointments, I wouldn't go so
far as Sandy White did in Monday's
Stanford Daily and conclude that
there is little relation between the
energy crisis and comet Kohoutek.
Rather the dimness of that body seems
to argue for the pervasiveness and
magnitude of the problem.
More seriously, Ms. White assigned
2 x h times less sensitivity to the human
eye than she should have. The scotopic
eye (one fully adapted to the dark)
can perceive stars as faint as the sixth
magnitude; the fifth magnitude is not
the limit. The error is not insignificant,
particulary in these days of obscure
comets that refuse to fulfill their early
promise: Ms. White blinded us to 64
percent of the stars that are visible
without optical aid.
A second error occurred when she
placed ice in comets' tails. If theory is
true, it is only the nucleus that is
niveous.

While comet Kohoutek may be less
"the comet of the century" than one
of its disppointments, I wouldn't go so
far as Sandy White did in Monday's
Stanford Daily and conclude that
there is little relation between the
energy crisis and comet Kohoutek.
Rather the dimness of that body seems
to argue for the pervasiveness and
magnitude of the problem.
More seriously, Ms. White assigned
2 x h times less sensitivity to the human
eye than she should have. The scotopic
eye (one fully adapted to the dark)
can perceive stars as faint as the sixth
magnitude; the fifth magnitude is not
the limit. The error is not insignificant,
particulary in these days of obscure
comets that refuse to fulfill their early
promise: Ms. White blinded us to 64
percent of the stars that are visible
without optical aid.
A second error occurred when she
placed ice in comets' tails. If theory is
true, it is only the nucleus that is
niveous.

The events surrounding the death
of a student on the Stanford campus
December 4th of last year have
prompted several questions concerning
the reaction of Cowell Health Center
to emergencies occurring within a
close proximity.
In this instance, the student
collapsed while playing basketball on
the courts between Stern and Wilbur
Halls. When it was realized the student
needed immediate medical care, the
first response was to send someone to
Cowell to bring a doctor. At Cowell,
the fact that an emergency existed
nearby was made clear to one of the
physicians. However, after a delay of
some duration (over five minutes), the
only response from Cowell was to call
the Stanford Fire Department. This
was also done by a student at the
scene of the emergency using a phone
in Stern Hall.
The Fire Department responded
immediately with a rescue unit.
Shortly thereafter an ambulance was
called and the student was removed to
the Medical Center where he was
pronounced dead on arrival.
Some as-yet-unanswered questions
should be raised. Why didn't personnel
from Cowell respond directly? Why
was there a delay in the call from
Cowell to the Fire Department? Does
this mean Cowell is unequipped to
handle accidents and emergencies and,
if so, is unaware of what procedure to
follow? In short, what assistance can
the Stanford community expect from
Cowell Health Center in time of
nearby emergency? Would it be better
to use the University emergency
number (321-2300, ext. 2313) even in
those instances where a doctor is
within a close distance?
It is hoped that by demanding
answers to the above questions, it will
be made clear just what the
responsibilities of Cowell Health
Center include.

the Stanford community expect from
Cowell Health Center in time of
nearby emergency? Would it be better
to use the University emergency
number (321-2300, ext. 2313) even in
those instances where a doctor is
within a close distance?
It is hoped that by demanding
answers to the above questions, it will
be made clear just what the
responsibilities of Cowell Health
Center include.

The Daily of Friday, Jan. 11, notes
that "University President Richard
Lyman stopped briefly outside the
[faculty senate] meeting to chat with
a demonstrator about David Starr
Jordan's position on ROTC." Lyman
asked about the source for the
information on a placard that Jordan
had disapproved of ROTC.
It is true that David Starr Jordan,
the first president of Stanford,
opposed the ideas presented in his day
for military instruction or drill at
educational institutions, whether

secondary schools or colleges. Jordan
did not believe that military training
was compatible with general
education.
Jordan's views can be found in the
New York Times for February 25,
1915, and in his book War and the
Breed (Boston: Beacon Press, 1915),
pp. 104-108, 225-229.

ROTC Humanization
Editor:
I am flattered that Larry Diamond
should list me as a faculty member
from whom the "humanely trained"
ROTC students of the future should
take courses while at Stanford.
Unfortunately there is no evidence
that attending elite institutions has
ever had a humanizing effect on either
our civilian or our military leadership.
John F. Kennedy, Dean Rusk, Robert
McNamara, and the Bundy and
Rostow brothers were all trained by
the likes of Professors Brown,
Rhinelander, Lewis and myself, and
once in power planned and executed
the invasion of one small country after
another in the interests of American
imperialism.
The way to protect the world from
American military power is not to
humanize the armed forces but to
change the uses to which they are put.
And that will happen only when we
have a civilian leadership in
Washington that repudiates the cold
war goals and policies of the past
thirty years.

Comet Corrections
Editor:
While comet Kohoutek may be less
"the comet of the century" than one
of its disppointments, I wouldn't go so
far as Sandy White did in Monday's
Stanford Daily and conclude that
there is little relation between the
energy crisis and comet Kohoutek.
Rather the dimness of that body seems
to argue for the pervasiveness and
magnitude of the problem.
More seriously, Ms. White assigned
2 x h times less sensitivity to the human
eye than she should have. The scotopic
eye (one fully adapted to the dark)
can perceive stars as faint as the sixth
magnitude; the fifth magnitude is not
the limit. The error is not insignificant,
particulary in these days of obscure
comets that refuse to fulfill their early
promise: Ms. White blinded us to 64
percent of the stars that are visible
without optical aid.
A second error occurred when she
placed ice in comets' tails. If theory is
true, it is only the nucleus that is
niveous.

Cowell Emergency Service
Editor:
The events surrounding the death
of a student on the Stanford campus
December 4th of last year have
prompted several questions concerning
the reaction of Cowell Health Center
to emergencies occurring within a
close proximity.
In this instance, the student
collapsed while playing basketball on
the courts between Stern and Wilbur
Halls. When it was realized the student
needed immediate medical care, the
first response was to send someone to
Cowell to bring a doctor. At Cowell,
the fact that an emergency existed
nearby was made clear to one of the
physicians. However, after a delay of
some duration (over five minutes), the
only response from Cowell was to call
the Stanford Fire Department. This
was also done by a student at the
scene of the emergency using a phone
in Stern Hall.
The Fire Department responded
immediately with a rescue unit.
Shortly thereafter an ambulance was
called and the student was removed to
the Medical Center where he was
pronounced dead on arrival.
Some as-yet-unanswered questions
should be raised. Why didn't personnel
from Cowell respond directly? Why
was there a delay in the call from
Cowell to the Fire Department? Does
this mean Cowell is unequipped to
handle accidents and emergencies and,
if so, is unaware of what procedure to
follow? In short, what assistance can
the Stanford community expect from
Cowell Health Center in time of
nearby emergency? Would it be better
to use the University emergency
number (321-2300, ext. 2313) even in
those instances where a doctor is
within a close distance?
It is hoped that by demanding
answers to the above questions, it will
be made clear just what the
responsibilities of Cowell Health
