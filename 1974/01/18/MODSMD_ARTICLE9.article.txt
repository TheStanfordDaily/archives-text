# Reply To Evers, Part II
## Take The Step Of Faith In Trusting Christ 
### 
It should be fairly obvious from
yesterday's discussion that God cannot
be thought of as an entity like the
entities which comprise our universe.
He is, if you like, 'the ground of our
being,' of our world, our bodies, our
breath. To believe in the God offhe
Bible is not to believe in an additional
entity; it is, among other things, to
understand who we are and what the
world is.
In one sense, God needs no proof.
Nonetheless, it is not sufficient to say
that it is obvious to everyone that
there is a God, that he loves us, and
that in Christ he has manifested
himself and is reconciling believers to
himself.
To many, belief is simply accepted;
for others like myself, it must stand up
under critical scrutiny. I had to know
that assertions about God were toot
simply spiritual phraseology for mam's
feelings and aspirations; I had to know
that belief was more than just handed
down tradition, and that religious
experience was not simply
misinterpreted physiological response.
Recognizing the lack of foundation
for materialism as a philosophy and
the breakdown of many long-held
assumptions about science, it became
apparent that a religious understanding
of the world is not simply the product

of ignorance and superstition. Desiring
truth and not willing to uncritically
accept the assumptions of religious
relativism, 1 investigated the evidential
basis for Christianity and found it to
be a solid foundation for faith.
Documents Reliable?
Had Christ demonstrated his
divinity through the fulfilment of Old
Testament prophecy, his miracles, his
sinless life, his death, and most
importantly his resurrection? This
raises the question of whether the
Biblical documents are in general
historically reliable enough to enable
us to come to any conclusion. If
miracles are, as David Hume argued, of
such a nature that no rational person
can believe in them, then obviously
the answer is no, for the Bible, and
particularly the Gospels, are full of
miracles.
Considering, therefore, briefly the
plausibility of miracles, we must
consider the objections that they are
cbntrary to all of our experience and if
believed make historical study
impossible.
I The first objection is weak for two
reasons. First, if a miracle is a
purposeful act of God and not a
random aberration from the natural
order, then we have no reason to
expect to encounter one in scientific

study or in our everyday affairs.
Secondly, however, we have no way of
knowing that we have not encountered
miracles. We cannot repeat one, hence
it is easy to assume that every unusual
event which we see has a natural cause.
Therefore it is impossible to say that
oui' experience makes the occurrenceof
a miracle improbable.
Miracles Still Plausible
Now does this mean that we are in
error for being skeptical about
reported miracles? No, not at all; the
fact that many people like to make up
tall tales and exaggerate stories and the
fact that many people are susceptible
to visions and fantasies ought to make
us skeptical, but these reports do not
in any way diminish the general
plausibility of a miracle occuring.
The second objection rests on the
fact that historical research is
dependent on their being causal
relationships among events. If there
were not, then it would be impossible
to evaluate whether any specific event
had actually occurred; no prior or
subsequent events would have any
bearing on the likelihood of its having
occurred. It is, however, as we have
noted, false to believe that the
occurrence of miracles invalidates the
causal principle on which the study of
history depends.

" Peter Payne

Some have said that although we
cannot demonstrate that miracles have
not occurred, we could never believe
in any specific instance that one had
occurred. This is because our only way
of evaluating whether it had occurred
is by looking for causal relationships,
and a miracle has no natural cause.
Now, although it is true that we
cannot look for causes of a miracle, we
can look at effects. As mentioned we
need to be skeptical, but if the
witnesses appear reliable and the
effects are most readily explained by
supposing that a miracle has taken,
then to deny that one has indeed
taken place is to go contrary to the
evidence.
With such in mind, I, as have many
others, concluded that the Biblical
documents are generally reliable and
that Jesus did indeed rise from the
dead.
Of course, the historical evidence is
not proof; it merely lends credibility
to the claims of Christ. We must be
willing to make the step of faith in
trusting him. As Christians we have
done this and experientially God has
confirmed himself to us.

others, concluded that the Biblical
documents are generally reliable and
that Jesus did indeed rise from the
dead.
Of course, the historical evidence is
not proof; it merely lends credibility
to the claims of Christ. We must be
willing to make the step of faith in
trusting him. As Christians we have
done this and experientially God has
confirmed himself to us.
(Peter Payne is a '73 graduate in
philosophy.)
It should be fairly obvious from
yesterday's discussion that God cannot
be thought of as an entity like the
entities which comprise our universe.
He is, if you like, 'the ground of our
being,' of our world, our bodies, our
breath. To believe in the God offhe
Bible is not to believe in an additional
entity; it is, among other things, to
understand who we are and what the
world is.
In one sense, God needs no proof.
Nonetheless, it is not sufficient to say
that it is obvious to everyone that
there is a God, that he loves us, and
that in Christ he has manifested
himself and is reconciling believers to
himself.
To many, belief is simply accepted;
for others like myself, it must stand up
under critical scrutiny. I had to know
that assertions about God were toot
simply spiritual phraseology for mam's
feelings and aspirations; I had to know
that belief was more than just handed
down tradition, and that religious
experience was not simply
misinterpreted physiological response.
Recognizing the lack of foundation
for materialism as a philosophy and
the breakdown of many long-held
assumptions about science, it became
apparent that a religious understanding
of the world is not simply the product

of ignorance and superstition. Desiring
truth and not willing to uncritically
accept the assumptions of religious
relativism, 1 investigated the evidential
basis for Christianity and found it to
be a solid foundation for faith.
Documents Reliable?
Had Christ demonstrated his
divinity through the fulfilment of Old
Testament prophecy, his miracles, his
sinless life, his death, and most
importantly his resurrection? This
raises the question of whether the
Biblical documents are in general
historically reliable enough to enable
us to come to any conclusion. If
miracles are, as David Hume argued, of
such a nature that no rational person
can believe in them, then obviously
the answer is no, for the Bible, and
particularly the Gospels, are full of
miracles.
Considering, therefore, briefly the
plausibility of miracles, we must
consider the objections that they are
cbntrary to all of our experience and if
believed make historical study
impossible.
I The first objection is weak for two
reasons. First, if a miracle is a
purposeful act of God and not a
random aberration from the natural
order, then we have no reason to
expect to encounter one in scientific

study or in our everyday affairs.
Secondly, however, we have no way of
knowing that we have not encountered
miracles. We cannot repeat one, hence
it is easy to assume that every unusual
event which we see has a natural cause.
Therefore it is impossible to say that
oui' experience makes the occurrenceof
a miracle improbable.
Miracles Still Plausible
Now does this mean that we are in
error for being skeptical about
reported miracles? No, not at all; the
fact that many people like to make up
tall tales and exaggerate stories and the
fact that many people are susceptible
to visions and fantasies ought to make
us skeptical, but these reports do not
in any way diminish the general
plausibility of a miracle occuring.
The second objection rests on the
fact that historical research is
dependent on their being causal
relationships among events. If there
were not, then it would be impossible
to evaluate whether any specific event
had actually occurred; no prior or
subsequent events would have any
bearing on the likelihood of its having
occurred. It is, however, as we have
noted, false to believe that the
occurrence of miracles invalidates the
causal principle on which the study of
history depends.

" Peter Payne

Some have said that although we
cannot demonstrate that miracles have
not occurred, we could never believe
in any specific instance that one had
occurred. This is because our only way
of evaluating whether it had occurred
is by looking for causal relationships,
and a miracle has no natural cause.
Now, although it is true that we
cannot look for causes of a miracle, we
can look at effects. As mentioned we
need to be skeptical, but if the
witnesses appear reliable and the
effects are most readily explained by
supposing that a miracle has taken,
then to deny that one has indeed
taken place is to go contrary to the
evidence.
With such in mind, I, as have many
others, concluded that the Biblical
documents are generally reliable and
that Jesus did indeed rise from the
dead.
Of course, the historical evidence is

Now, although it is true that we
cannot look for causes of a miracle, we
can look at effects. As mentioned we
need to be skeptical, but if the
witnesses appear reliable and the
effects are most readily explained by
supposing that a miracle has taken,
then to deny that one has indeed
taken place is to go contrary to the
evidence.
With such in mind, I, as have many
others, concluded that the Biblical
documents are generally reliable and
that Jesus did indeed rise from the
dead.
Of course, the historical evidence is
not proof; it merely lends credibility
to the claims of Christ. We must be
willing to make the step of faith in
trusting him. As Christians we have
done this and experientially God has
confirmed himself to us.

It should be fairly obvious from
yesterday's discussion that God cannot
be thought of as an entity like the
entities which comprise our universe.
He is, if you like, 'the ground of our
being,' of our world, our bodies, our
breath. To believe in the God offhe
Bible is not to believe in an additional
entity; it is, among other things, to
understand who we are and what the
world is.
In one sense, God needs no proof.
Nonetheless, it is not sufficient to say
that it is obvious to everyone that
there is a God, that he loves us, and
that in Christ he has manifested
himself and is reconciling believers to
himself.
To many, belief is simply accepted;
for others like myself, it must stand up
under critical scrutiny. I had to know
that assertions about God were toot
simply spiritual phraseology for mam's
feelings and aspirations; I had to know
that belief was more than just handed
down tradition, and that religious
experience was not simply
misinterpreted physiological response.
Recognizing the lack of foundation
for materialism as a philosophy and
the breakdown of many long-held
assumptions about science, it became
apparent that a religious understanding
of the world is not simply the product

of ignorance and superstition. Desiring
truth and not willing to uncritically
accept the assumptions of religious
relativism, 1 investigated the evidential
basis for Christianity and found it to
be a solid foundation for faith.
Documents Reliable?
Had Christ demonstrated his
divinity through the fulfilment of Old
Testament prophecy, his miracles, his
sinless life, his death, and most
importantly his resurrection? This
raises the question of whether the
Biblical documents are in general
historically reliable enough to enable
us to come to any conclusion. If
miracles are, as David Hume argued, of
such a nature that no rational person
can believe in them, then obviously
the answer is no, for the Bible, and
particularly the Gospels, are full of
miracles.
Considering, therefore, briefly the
plausibility of miracles, we must
consider the objections that they are
cbntrary to all of our experience and if
believed make historical study
impossible.
I The first objection is weak for two
reasons. First, if a miracle is a
purposeful act of God and not a
random aberration from the natural
order, then we have no reason to
expect to encounter one in scientific

study or in our everyday affairs.
Secondly, however, we have no way of
knowing that we have not encountered
miracles. We cannot repeat one, hence
it is easy to assume that every unusual
event which we see has a natural cause.
Therefore it is impossible to say that
oui' experience makes the occurrenceof
a miracle improbable.
Miracles Still Plausible
Now does this mean that we are in
error for being skeptical about
reported miracles? No, not at all; the
fact that many people like to make up
tall tales and exaggerate stories and the
fact that many people are susceptible
to visions and fantasies ought to make
us skeptical, but these reports do not
in any way diminish the general
plausibility of a miracle occuring.
The second objection rests on the
fact that historical research is
dependent on their being causal
relationships among events. If there
were not, then it would be impossible
to evaluate whether any specific event
had actually occurred; no prior or
subsequent events would have any
bearing on the likelihood of its having
occurred. It is, however, as we have
noted, false to believe that the
occurrence of miracles invalidates the
causal principle on which the study of
history depends.

" Peter Payne

Some have said that although we
cannot demonstrate that miracles have
not occurred, we could never believe
in any specific instance that one had
occurred. This is because our only way
of evaluating whether it had occurred
is by looking for causal relationships,
and a miracle has no natural cause.
Now, although it is true that we
cannot look for causes of a miracle, we
can look at effects. As mentioned we
need to be skeptical, but if the
witnesses appear reliable and the
effects are most readily explained by
supposing that a miracle has taken,
then to deny that one has indeed
taken place is to go contrary to the
evidence.
With such in mind, I, as have many
others, concluded that the Biblical
documents are generally reliable and
that Jesus did indeed rise from the
dead.
Of course, the historical evidence is
not proof; it merely lends credibility
to the claims of Christ. We must be
willing to make the step of faith in
trusting him. As Christians we have
