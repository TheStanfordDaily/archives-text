# IRS Forces Campus Shell Price Cuts
## 
### 
Campus Shell was among 11 gas
stations in Santa Clara County ordered
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
last week to refund gasoline
overcharges by lowering prices.
Campus Shell overcharged its
customers by $2919 — the second
largest total of the 11 stations ordered
to cut back prices.
Campus Shell must reduce prices
1.6-2.6 cents below authorized rates
until the $2919 is returned to
customers. Other stations must cut
rates from two to five cents below the
established ceiling, an IRS spokesman
said.
Gary Andrews, owner of Campus
Shell, yesterday refused to comment
on the IRS findings or the amount of
gasoline the station has available to
sell.
Gas prices posted at the station
yesterday were 44 cents per gallon for
regular and 48 cents per gallon for
premium. The station has recently sold
regular gasoline for as much as 50
cents per gallon.
Other Palo Alto stations cited by
the IRS include Chris and Bill's
Chevron, 3972 El Camino Real, and
Stagner Chevron, 2160 El Camino
Real.
The IRS survey of 123 stations in
the county revealed that 64 of them
were overcharging a total of some
$60,000. Another list of violators is
expected to be released later this
week.
