# Insulting Article Requires Apology
## Mr. Chang Feature Lacks Understanding

Hsu & Chang

"Ching Chong Chinaman,
Sitting on a fence,
Trying to make a dollar,
Out of fifteen cents."
If Claire Spiegel's article in last Tuesday's Daily, "Mr. Chang: Watchman
Living on 15 Cents a Day" is any indication of what is considered an attitude of
consciousness and openness to racial and cultural differences, then the liberal
facade has finally collapsed.
From the outset, the article begins what amounts to a slap in the face for
anyone of Chinese extraction. Ms. Spiegel uses descriptions to depict Chang
Chung-Kuei which are reminiscent of the once-thought innocuous and much
accepted picture of the "inscrutable Chinaman." The article, a justifiable
attempt at a human interest story is so cluttered with obnoxious references to
seemingly unique Oriental qualities as to make it an insulting piece of writing
that is abusively denigrating to a type of behavior that does not happen to
conform to the white standard.
Spiegel in constantly referring to Chang as Mr. Chang, a definite departure
from normal Daily style, renders him an aura of mystery that communicates the
view of a person already too distant to grasp and understand. She goes on to
picture Chang as an eccentric old man whose idiosyncratic behavior makes him
something of an ascetic anomaly in our "social, open" world. The writer
impresses upon the reader the picture of this strange old man whose inscrutable
behavior, his helplessness, his frugality, and his secretiveness is something to be
laughed about.
Chang is one who "shuffles," seemingly walking "without moving his legs."
Has it been so long ago that the Chinese were pictured as people who did not
walk but "shuffled." His "big buck teeth are white" (how absolutely
astounding!), "an enormous white laboratory smock droops from his 4'10"
frame," he has a "sharp old eye," and he talks with a "mouthful of marbles."
The last quote which came from some source other than the writer herself was a
tasteless inclusion that was totally unnecessary.
Unnecessary Reference
Had Chang been some Frenchman whose English was likewise as
unintelligible, it would not have been necessary to refer to "a mouthful of
marbles." Instead what a perfect way the quote was to convey the idea that
Chang does not speak the perfect English that we should expect from all
foreigners.
In addition, Chang "roves" like an "emperor strolling through gardens.' He is
"never kowtowing to those in the academic world." This is an unfortunate
attempt at colorful writing that mocks a Chinese act of reverential
acknowledgment.
The article is far from being a sympathetic attempt to understand Chang.
Indeed, what are seemingly unique qualities of his are made the object of
ridicule. The frugality that he displays rather than being virtuous is instead
"penny-pinching . . . parsimony." His keen ability for memorization and recall is
seen as something awesomely extraordinary ("with a clarity to defy even John
Dean lll")rather than being really understood and accepted as the product of a
different educational process. Spiegel, in attempting to legendize Chang, has not
been very understanding of his behavior; and as a result, she has portrayed him
as someone with laughable peculiarities.
Disturbing Characterization
The overall effect of the article is also very disturbing. The article exhibits a
blatant characterization of Chinese in terms that are analogous to the degrading
Sambo and "lazy Mexican" conceptualizations of blacks and Mexicans. And how

acceptable would an article have been that made references to either of those
caricatures?
Although much of the article was very insulting, in all fairness to Ms. Spiegel,
we recognize that it is likely that she had no malicious intent in her writing.
However, the recognition that the connotations heretofore referred to were not
intended should make it painfully obvious that behind verbalized acceptance
may lie the subtle, "quiet" racism that is even more vicious than outright
denunciation.
We do think that Spiegel has been needlessly unkind to Chang as a person.
Furthermore, the Daily has been thoughtless in its front page presentation of the
story, especially when it appears from the final paragraph that Chang highly
values his private life. "He abhors publicity." A front page spread in a newspaper
is hardly indicative of regard for Chang's wishes.
Finally, we feel that it is in order that the Daily formally apologize to the
Stanford Chinese community for the publication of such an offensive article.
