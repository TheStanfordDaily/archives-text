# Traveling Swimmers Win Twice

### STEVE BAKER 
Winning nine of 13 events, the Stanford
swimming team methodically destroyed
Michigan in Ann Arbor Friday night 65-48.
Twenty-four hours later the Cards liquidated
Yale 86-27 in New Haven, as coach Jim
Gaughran's swimmers improved their record
to three wins and no defeats.
Although they arrived in Ann Arbor only
30 minutes before the start of the meet, the
Cardinals let nothing phase them. "Climbing
out of the plane and climbing into the pool
right away hurt us a little bit. But with our
budget, we couldn't have left a day earlier,"
Gaughran explained.
Distance freestyler Terry Sutton and the
incomparable John Heneken led the attack
against the lOth-ranked Wolverines. Sutton
took the 1000 in a time of 9:46.27, edging
teammate Steve Strong, who posted a

9:46.87. In the 500, Sutton won in 4:43.03.
Heneken outbattled Tom Azuba to
capture the 200 individual medley in
1:55.62, then set a pool record in the 200
breaststroke with a 2:08.36.
As they did against Washington last
weekend, the Cardinals captured both relays.
In the medley relay Randy Whitchurch,
Heneken Brian Roux and Dave Fairbank
clocked 3:29.26, while in the free relay
Fairoank teamed with Bruce Goodwin, Dean
Anderson and Martin Pedley for the win.
Goodwin and Whitchurch compiled
personal best times in their specialties.
Goodwin took the 100 free in 46.73.
Whitchurch won the 200 backstroke in
1:57.91. Not bad, considering they just got
off the plane.
Saturday night found Stanford in New
Haven, drowning the Yale swimmers. It was

sweet revenge for Gaughran, who had lost
two meets to thelvy-Leaguersback in '69 and
'70. Yale had lost only eight dual meets in 14
years before this confrontation, but Saturday
coach Philip Moriarty's Elis dropped 11 of 13
events to the Cardinals.
Stanford swept the 50, the 100, the
butterfly, and the backstroke. Fairbank and
Goodwin were one-two respectively in both
of the sprints. In the fly, Paul Clark edged
Sutton, while Whitchurch and Jack Deppe
took care of the backstroke. Needless to say,
Hencken won both the 200 individual
medley and the 200 breast.
A fitting end to the weekend's activities
came with the free relay. Despite all the
plane hopping and loss of sleep, Stanford
clobbered Yale by over nine seconds.
