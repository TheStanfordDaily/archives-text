# Wrestlers Thump Aztecs: Three Pins In 37-9 Win
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Wrestling fans were treated to a
little coaching strategy and a lot
of fine performances Saturday, as
the Cards walloped San Diego
State, 37-9 in Maples Pavilion.
The only disappointment for
Stanford rooters was not seeing
blind wrestler Bob Sweetman in

action for the first time this
season. Sweetman was suited up
and scheduled to wrestle in the
126-pound class, but won by
forfeit instead.
After Stanford forfeited at 118
pounds, Sweetman was set to go
against Lindsey Yip, but Aztec
coach decided to forfeit and send

Yip at 134 pounds instead. Jim
Tatarakis, who was reportedly not
feeling well, wrestled Yip instead
of receiving an expected forfeit.
Tatarakis, quite a bit heavier
than his opponent, didn't waste
any time as he beat Yip in less
than a minute and a half. Nothing
like a first-round pin to cure one's
ills.
Mark Yancey (142) didn't get a
pin, but thoroughly dominated his
opponent. Yancey led 10-1 after
one period, 20-2 after two, and
won 32-5, getting seven near-falls
in the process.
At 150, Charlie Masch won a
14-11 decision in one of the
closest matches of the evening.
Masch trailed 4-0 early, but took a
5-4 lead after one period. He
never trailed again, twice building
up four-point margins.
Craig Reynolds (158) won with
a third-round pin to boost the
Card lead to 25-6. When Jeff
Richardson decisioned his
opponent 8-2, the 28-6 margin
became insurmountable.
But the Cards weren't through.
Marc Frelier (177) trimmed his
foe, 5-2 and Roy Tolles (190)
built up a 6-1 lead before a third
round pin.
In the heavyweight class, Kris
Westersund got off to a poor start,
trailing 7-0 after two periods, but
came back to 7-5 with a reversal
and near fall, before succumbing,
11-6.
The win was the injury-plagued
Cards fourth of the season against
five defeats. Stanford will get a
chance to even its record
Wednesday afternoon when the
team travels to Cal State Hay ward
for a 3 p.m. match.
