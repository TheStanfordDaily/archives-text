# Ruggers Rally For 12-10 Win
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
You don't have to tell the San
Francisco Rugby Club how UCLA
felt after the Notre Dame game.
They know. SFRC led the Card
ruggers 10-6 with about two
minutes remaining in the contest
before Stanford rallied for a 12-10
win Saturday in a quagmire
formerly known as Harry Maloney
Field.
The Cards had trouble
controlling the slippery ball all
day. Stanford missed two drop
goals in the first period with the
slippery ball, while SFRC
converted one of two goals.
SFRC's missed goal hit the right
upright and bounced off.
But while the ball may have
been wet, the hitting was heavy.
Football stars Forrie Martin, Craig
Zaltoskv and Gordy Riegel caused
four stoppages of the game, all
SFRC injury timeouts. "The
reason 1 enjoy rugby is because I
like to hit," said Martin.
But Forrie did more than hit.
He made like a running back in
the final minutes, using some fine
power running to score the try
which knotted the game at 12
each. Larry Lieberman added the
conversion to put the Cards out in
front to stay.
"I hope the football coaches
weren't out here today. I want to
play linebacker next year,"
quipped Martin, a former high
school fullback. "The wings really
don't get the ball that much, so
when I got it I was determined to
score."
SFRC jumped off to a 3-0
halftime lead as the Cards blew
two kicks. Stanford seemed to be
on defense the whole first half.
Jack Schultz got the Cards on
the board in the second half with
a try, taking a pass from
Lieberman and barreling 10 yards
for the score. Lieberman added
the conversion and the Cards had
a 6-3 lead.
But that advantage was
short-lived, as SFRC came right
back to knot the score on a try.
The conversion failed, however,
setting the stage for Martin's
heroics.
"I really like the potential we
have," Forrie said after his
game-winning score. "With the
great hitting of guys like Riegel,
Zaltosky, Test, Schultz and
Lipberman, I think we're going all
the way to Monterey. These
games are just warmups. What
we're really shooting for is
winning the Monterey
Tournament."

SFRC's missed goal hit the right
upright and bounced off.
But while the ball may have
been wet, the hitting was heavy.
Football stars Forrie Martin, Craig
Zaltoskv and Gordy Riegel caused
four stoppages of the game, all
SFRC injury timeouts. "The
reason 1 enjoy rugby is because I
like to hit," said Martin.
But Forrie did more than hit.
He made like a running back in
the final minutes, using some fine
power running to score the try
which knotted the game at 12
each. Larry Lieberman added the
conversion to put the Cards out in
front to stay.
"I hope the football coaches
weren't out here today. I want to
play linebacker next year,"
quipped Martin, a former high
school fullback. "The wings really
don't get the ball that much, so
when I got it I was determined to
score."
SFRC jumped off to a 3-0
halftime lead as the Cards blew
two kicks. Stanford seemed to be
on defense the whole first half.
Jack Schultz got the Cards on
the board in the second half with
a try, taking a pass from
Lieberman and barreling 10 yards
for the score. Lieberman added
the conversion and the Cards had
a 6-3 lead.
But that advantage was
short-lived, as SFRC came right
back to knot the score on a try.
The conversion failed, however,
setting the stage for Martin's
heroics.
"I really like the potential we
have," Forrie said after his
game-winning score. "With the
great hitting of guys like Riegel,
Zaltosky, Test, Schultz and
Lipberman, I think we're going all
the way to Monterey. These
games are just warmups. What
we're really shooting for is
winning the Monterey
Tournament."
You don't have to tell the San
Francisco Rugby Club how UCLA
felt after the Notre Dame game.
They know. SFRC led the Card
ruggers 10-6 with about two
minutes remaining in the contest
before Stanford rallied for a 12-10
win Saturday in a quagmire
formerly known as Harry Maloney
Field.
The Cards had trouble
controlling the slippery ball all
day. Stanford missed two drop
goals in the first period with the
slippery ball, while SFRC
converted one of two goals.
