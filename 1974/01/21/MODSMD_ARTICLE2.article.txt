# Law School Graduate Convicted Of Felony
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Mick Goldstein, a 1973 Stanford
law school graduate, was found guilty
of four felonies by a Phoenix jury in a
federal trial that ended Dec. 21.
Goldstein and two Arizona
residents, Lorraine and Harry Bishara
were charged with harboring escaped
prisoner Ronald Beaty, concealing his
escape from authorities, helping him
elude capture, and conspiracy in the
escape plan. The Bisharas were also
convicted on all four counts.
Beaty escaped from the California
Institution for Men at Chino Oct. 6,
1972 and was a fugitive for 66 days
before police recaptured him on Dec.
11.
In a plea bargain, Beaty received a
life sentence for the murder of prison
guard Jesus Sanchez, killed in the
ambush-escape. Beaty turned state's
evidence, implicating members of the
now-disbanded Bay Area revolutionary
organization Venceremos, and others,
in a plan for his escape and describing
various locations in the Bay Area and
in Arizona where he hid while he was a
fugitive.
As the prosecution's star witness in
the Arizona trial, Beaty told the jury
that he spent three days at the Bishara
home on the Navaho reservation in
Arizona. Goldstein was living with the
Bisharas while he was serving an
apprenticeship at the legal services
office on the reservation.
Beaty also testified that Goldstein

was his contact with fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin and other
alleged co-conspirators in the Bay
Area.
However, while testifying in
another trial stemming from the
escape, Beaty admitted that he had
lied during grand jury testimony when
making statements about the
involvement of Franklin and others.
Goldstein has denied any
involvement in an escape conspiracy.
He claims he met Beaty only once
during a party at the Bisharas' home,
conversed with him for about 45
minutes, and did not know Beaty's
real identity or that he was an escaped
federal prisoner at the time. Goldstein
also denies any connection between
himself and Franklin.
If a federal judge upholds the
verdict when motions for acquittal and
a new trial are argued at sentencing
Jan. 28, Goldstein says he and the
Bisharas will appeal.
In a related development, the
California Assembly criminal justice
committee will meet tomorrow to
consider reimbursing San Bernardino
County for the $750,000 cost of the
trial of Andrea Holman Burt and
Benton Douglas Burt.
The Burts were convicted last July
on charges of second-degree murder,
assault, and rescuing Beaty. Beaty's
testimony placed them at the scene of
the escape.
