# Skaters Seek First Win
## 
### QUIGLEY S. PETERSON 
Stanford's skating Cardinals
will lace up for tomorrow's
contest with California seeking
their first victory of the new year.
Coach Pat Baldwin hopes to send
"three solid lines" against Cal.
The team was hampered with
injuries during the latter part of
fall quarter and the Cardinals will
still be without the services of Jay
•Johnston, who led all scorers with
16 goals last quarter. He is
presently back east for personal
reasons. Tom Hecklery is closest
to Johnston with seven goals.
A notch in the victory column
will be especially important
tomorrow night. First of all,
Stanford is winless in four
outings, having registered only
two ties and two losses in those
four attempts. One of the ties
came against Cal during dead
week after the Cards had fought
from a 4-1 deficit to take a 5-4
lead early in the third period.
Thus, victory against this
much-improved Cal team would
be doubly sweet.
Game time is 8 p.m. at
Belmont Iceland, which is located
on Old Country Rd., just off the
Ralston Ave. exit from Bayshore.
