## Number-One Irish Seek Executive Clemency 
### 
From The Associated Press
The Irish arc number one — at
least for a week. But it will take a
combination of the energy crisis
and executive clemency to spare
Notre Dame the ultimate test of
that top-ranked status.
The Irish, you see, visit
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion Saturday
night, a trip that coach Digger
Phelps would just as soon pass up.
"I'm hoping for President
Nixon to call and cancel our
flight," said Phelps. "I hope we
run out of gas before we get
there."
In case you were branded on
an uninhabited desert isie over the
weekend, it was the Bruins who
ran out of gas on Saturday, as the
Irish scored the last 12 points of
the game to end the longest win
streak in collegiate basketball
history.
Irish guard Dwight Clay
meshed an 18-footer with 28
seconds left to give Notre Dame
its first and only lead of the game
at 71-70, snapping the Bruins'
streak at 88 games.
"When the ball came to me I
was open and I knew we had to
have it," explained Clay. "So I
just concentrated on the shot and,
thankfully, I made it."
Trailed By 11
The Irish, 10-0 on the season,
trailed by 11 points with
three-and-a-half minutes left.
Then center John Shumate scored
a pair of quick buckets, igniting a
furious comeback. Gary Brokaw

contributed two clutch jump
shots down the stretch and passed
off to Clay for the decisive basket,
capping a frantic, 12-point Irish
streak.
UCLA had three shots from
short range in the closing seconds
before Shumate grabbed the
rebound at the buzzer.
All-American Bill Walton
missed one of those final
desperation shots, and although
he scored 24 points, BrUin coach
John Wooden indicated his 6-11
center, who had missed the
previous three games due to a
back injury, was not operating at
full strength.
"Obviously, Bill wasn't as
mobile as he was in the past,"
Wooden said after the game. "I'm
sure he will be next week. He was
reluctant to take his crossover
hook shot and his injury hurt his
board play."
Better Measure Saturday
The 63-year-old UCLA coach,
whose 26 Bruin teams have won
566 games and lost 140, added, "I
think you are going to get a better
measure of this game next
Saturday. If they win there,
you've got to say, 'They're a
better ball club.'
"If we don't have to struggle to
win at home, then I'll have to feel
that UCLA would be better on a
neutral court,.
"If the two teams do meet for
the third time this season on a
neutral court, it almost certainly
would be in the NCAA

tournament."
Gary Brokaw and John
Shumate led the Irish with 25 and
24 points, respectively, and Clay's
clincher with 28 seconds left
caused 11,343 Notre Dame fans
to mob players and manhandle
coaches.
It was a 20-minute celebration
reminiscent of the scene Jan. 23,
1971, when UCLA last lost a
game — again to the Irish.
Mouths Shut
Following the game, most
Bruins followed Wooden's advice:
"When you get whipped, keep
your mouths shut. The winners
are supposed to do the talking "
But at least one player, Pete
Trgovich, was confident that
"we'll get 'em next week."
Wooden said to newsmen after
the game: "If I said it once, I have
said it a hundred times. Once we

broke the record last year, the
streak was meaningless. I am fairly
certain my players felt this way. I
am not mad or glad about the end
of the streak."
Earlier, the soft-spoken coach
had said, "Rather than calling
what we have achieved a dynasty,
1 prefer to think of it as a cycle.
And I believe all cycles come to
an end."
In other Pac-8 action, Oregon
dropped a 76-66 decision to Air
Force, Stanford's opponent
tonight. Dan Kraft led the Cadets
with 22 points, while center
Gerald Willet paced the Ducks
with 18 points.
Washington State beat
Montana State 53-48, while
Washington upended Hawaii
80-70. The Huskies scored 20
straight points early in the first
half and coasted to the win.
