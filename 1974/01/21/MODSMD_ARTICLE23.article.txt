# Charitable Cardinals Turn Over Another One
## 
### 
Rich Kelley's statistics
Saturday night epitomized the
frustration of 1973-74 Stanford
basketball.
Kelley scored 17 points,
grabbed 20 rebounds, contributed
10 assists — and committed 12
turnovers as the Cards wasted
their finest offensive effort of the
season in a 91-82 loss to Utah in
Salt Lake City.
Overall, the Cards coughed up
the ball 31 times against the
Running Utes, who lived up to
their nickname as they streaked to
their 11th victory of the season
against only three losses.
"They were explosive —
unbelievably quick," Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar said in a
telephone interview yesterday.
"We had a tough time keeping up
with 'em on a man-to-man basis."
Stanford never did keep up
with elusive Utah guard Luther
"Ticky" Burden, who converted
13-18 field goal attempts and 4-5
free throws in a 30-point effort.
Tyrone Medley added 22 for the
Utes, much to the delight of 9785
screaming partisans at Utah's
Special Events Arena, where the
Utes are undefeated this season.
Sohpomore forward Ed
Schweitzer paced the Cardinal

attack, scoring 22 points and
hauling down 15 rebounds.
"Eddie played well," Dallmar
said, "but he could have had a
bundle more — he missed some
shots he would normally make."
Schweitzer played only 24
minutes, mainly because Dallmar
"substituted freely and tried a
variety of combinations."
Dallmar also complimented4he
play of guard Ben Bluitt, #ho
connected on 6-9 field £oal
attempts in his first game at a
starter. Other Stanford
included solid performances by
guard Melvin Arterberry, *ho
scored 10 points, and forward
Mike Mann, who contributed |ive
points in a brief 11-minute
The Cards outrebounded the
Utes, 49-40. Both teams shot
better than 50 percent from the
floor and 70 percent from &he
foul line.
Stanford, now 5-8 on ;ihe
season, was playing witfcfeut
forward Dave Frost, who quifjthe
team Thursday because of chngnic
knee problems. Tim Patteifcon
(6-11) started in place of Frost
(6-6), giving the Cardinals a ffl»nt
line averaging 6-1 OVi
At times, however, Dalajkar
abandoned the tall lineup, omce
moving Arterberry to forward in


an attempt to match Utah's
quickness.
Stanford was hurt by two
technical fouls, one called on
Kelley and one charged to
assistant coach Bub Bowling.
Kelley's technical came when he
placed the ball on the floor
following a traveling violation.
The officials slapped a technical
on Bowling when he stood up on
the sidelines.
"I wasn't pleased with the
officiating," Dallmar said, "but
that's the way it goes."
The loss was Stanford's fifth in
a row and seventh in its last eight
games. Prospects had looked
brighter for tonight's game against
Air Force at Colorado Springs,
but Friday night the Cadets upset
Oregon, one of Stanford's earlier
conquerors.
"Oregon looked bad Friday
night," said Bowling who scouted
the game. "Ron Lee looked like
just another player."
Air Force has now won three
straight after dropping its first
seven games. The Cadets, whose
tallest player is 6-7 because of
entrance requirements, are led by
Rich Nickelson, Jim Ekan and
Dan Kraft. Kraft scored 22 points
against Oregon.

THE GENTLEMEN'S GAME — After rugby games, opponents traditionally gather together for a few
friendly beers. But before the party, the action is traditionally furious, as it was Saturday at Harry
Maloney Field. Stanford (white shirts) defeated San Francisco Rugby Club, 12-10.
