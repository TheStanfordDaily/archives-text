Congress Reconvenes Today
WASHINGTON — Congress reconvenes today after a
recess during which members say they found the people
back home disillusioned and apprehensive about the future.
Energy matters will dominate the opening days of the
session.
President Nixon was scheduled to meet during the week
with congressional leaders to discuss legislation giving him
emergency powers to cope with the energy crisis.
Senate subcommittee hearings are scheduled today on
the severity of the energy crisis. Both federal officials and
oil company executives are scheduled to testify.
The Senate Watergate committee will meet in executive
session Wednesday to decide if it will hold further public
hearings or write a final report and go out of business.
The impeachment question remains before the House
Judiciary Committee.
Syrians May Release Israeli POWs
TEL AVIV — A high American official said yesterday
that Syrian President Hafez Assad has softened his refusal
to turn over a list of Israeli war prisoners held in Syria.
The refusal has been a major barrier to Israeli-Syrian
negotiations. Its removal could signal a breakthrough in
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's efforts to get a
troop disengagement accord between Syrians and Israelis
similar to the one he got last week between Egyptians and
Israelis.
The official disclosed the change in Syrian policy after
Kissinger talked with Assad for more than 4'/2 hours in
Damascus and then jetted to Tel Aviv with what he said
were Assad's "very constructive suggestions" for
disengagement.
The Syrian leader apparently showed Kissinger a
willingness to provide the prisoner list and to permit visits
by International Red Cross representatives during
disengagement talks, assuming there is substantial progress
toward a settlement.
Chinese Overrun Paracel Islands
SAIGON — A Chinese amphibious force of up to 500
men backed by four MIG bombers seized the last of the
disputed Paracel islands in the South China Sea yesterday,

the Saigon command reported.
It said the Chinese overran 150 South Vietnamese troops
and apparently ended the two-day air, sea and ground
battle for the strategic islands, claimed by both sides and
prized as a possible jumping off point for off-shore oil
exploration.
Argentine Guerillas Seize Garrison
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Between 60 and 70 leftist
guerrillas disguised as soldiers and traveling aboard army
trucks seized the 2000-man army garrison at Azul for seven
hours early yesterday, and killed the head of the tank
regiment, his wife and another soldier, the army reported.
A communique said five soldiers were injured, three
seriously, and that two guerrillas were killed and
presumably more slain or wounded terrorists were taken
along by their fleeing comrades.
Nixon's Popularity Hits New Low
PRINCETON, N.J. — The latest Gallup Poll indicates
President Nixon's popularity is back to its all-time low - 27
percent.
The rating is based on a poll of 1504 adults conducted
Jan. 4-7, soon after the Internal Revenue Service
announced it was re-auditing the President's recent tax
returns.
Dairy Co-Op 'Sought Total Control'
WASHINGTON The nation's largest dairy cooperative,
facing a government antitrust suit, has been accused by a
former official of having sought control of all milk supplies
in the United States.
David L. Parr said in a court deposition that a major goal
of the Texas-based Associated Milk Producers, Inc., was "to
manage or control the total supply of milk in the United
States, including imports and exports."
AMPI pledged $2 million to President Nixon's 1972
re-election campaign, and eventually gave $202,000.
