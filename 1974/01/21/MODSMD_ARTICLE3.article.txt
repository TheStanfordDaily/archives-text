# 'CS' Zoning Ordinance
## Council To Vote On Compromise 
### BILL ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council will
meet tonight to decide whether to
accept a proposed settlement of the
"cs" zone dispute between the city
and Stanford.
The council will vote on whether to
modify two requests to the Santa
Clara County Board of Supervisors
that the University claimed would
have had adverse effects on it.
"All indications are favorable for
the acceptance of the compromise by

the council," said Naphtali Knox, Palo
Alto city planning commissioner.
The compromise calls for the
University to remove all or parts of
three areas from its county-issued
blanket use permit — which allows
development without an advertised
public hearing — in return for Palo
Alto's support of its request to be
exempted from certain provisions of
the ordinance.
The council will vote tonight on
whether to support the University's
claim.
Dispute
The county's proposed "city
services" zone ordinance stirred a
dispute between Palo Alto and the
University late last year when the city
council recommended to the Board of
Supervisors that the ordinance be
passed without Stanford's proposed
"amendment 6A," which would
exclude Stanford from certain of the
ordinance's provisions.
The ordinance, if passed by" the
county, will force developers of land
adjacent to cities to seek annexation
of the land. The University has sought
special consideration, pointing out
that it provides its own municipal
services.
On Nov. 12, the council voted to
ask the county to remove the blanket
use permit on all lands west of
Junipero Serra Boulevard, a major
portion of the campus. The Council
will also vote tonight on whether to
modify that request.
Use Permit
Under the provisions of the
University's blanket use permit, issued
in 1962, Stanford must submit plans
for any new buildings to the
Architecture and Site Approval
Committee of the Santa Clara County.
The county must then notify Palo
Alto regarding the potential
environmental impact of the plan,
Knox explained.
But such consultations do not
provide as good a forum for the city to
voice its complaints as do the
advertised public hearings that would
take place if the lands weren't
protected by the blanket use permit,
Knox stated.
Hence, the Palo Alto City Council
sought to remove certain Stanford
lands from the provisions of the
permit. When Stanford agreed to allow

removal of the lands, city officials
agreed to ask the council to drop its
opposition.
"Stanford made its first substantial
offer, and the three Palo Alto city
council members who attended the
meeting were willing to accept it,"
Knox explained. "With the blanket use
permit modified on approximately
250 acres bordering Palo Alto, the city
believed that a safety valve existed.
Hence, there was a basis for
compromise."
Areas Affected
Three campus areas would be
affected by modification of the use
permit, according to University
attorney Michael Hud nail:
— the arboretum, designated area A
in the compromise;
— some University land along
Willow Road, Area B. There is some
question remaining of how many acres
would actually be exempted from the
permit, but Hudnall said he expected
