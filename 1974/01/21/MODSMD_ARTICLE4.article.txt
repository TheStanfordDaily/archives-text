# Childrens' Center Move Faces Obstacles; May Be Forced To Vacate Mayfield Site
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Funding and locating a new site represent the
major obstacles to moving the Childrens' Center of
the Stanford Community, the cooperative campus
day care center.
The center, located on Mayfield Ave., must make
way for the construction of a housing project for
emeritus and junior professors. Pending final Board
of Trustees approval, the center will be forced to
vacate the present site in June.
"We're a train on a moving track," explains Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons. "Usually, we
wouldn't worry about funding until we knew how
much it was going to cost, and we don't know how
much its going to cost."
Lyons estimates the possible cost of moving the
center at between $150,000 and $200,000.
Contrary to a previous report, none of the $11,000
ASSU child care fee assessment of 1972 remains to
be spent on the move.
Capital Improvements
According to Phyllis Craig, consultant on child
care to Lyons and former director of the Childrens'
Center, most of the ASSU funding was spent on
needed capital improvements. The ASSU then
allowed the remaining funds to be used for needed
equipment and administrative salaries during the
first months of operation.
"It really saved the center," Craig said of the

ASSU assessment. "We spent it on only what we
needed most."
The expense of moving the Childrens' Center
depends almost entirely on which of three
alternative proposals is adopted. According to
executive assistant to Vice President Robert
Augsburger, Ed Shaw, one option would be to move
the buildings which already house the center to
another part of the campus.
The problem with that plan, said Shaw, is that
the present buildings "may not be adequate to the
center's needs."
More "Space
Craig believes that the center needs more space.
"We'd like to bring the number [of children] up to
150," she states, adding that, "We turn away people
all the time." There are now 125 children served by
the center.
Another alternative is to move the center into
another building on campus. Although Shaw
described this as the least expensive option,
buildings considered are "usually already occupied."
Lyons stated that a search for possible buildings
for the center was unsuccessful, but that a second
survey is now in progress.
The third and most costly option is to build
modular or "flexible" buildings somewhere on
campus. According to Shaw, this option might be

most advantageous to the center, since buildings
could be designed to meet its particular needs.
Three Possible Sites
There are three possible sites for such
construction; on Bowdoin Ave. at the site of the
Escondido Gardens, on Serra St. near the Physical
Plant, and somewhere near the Medical Center.
Shaw said that the Serra Street site might offer
advantages to the center because it is in a wooded
area. The Medical Center area offers an advantage
because many of the parents using the Childrens'
Center are medical students.
Although Craig contended that the University
was "pretty late in trying to decide what to do with
us," she said that University efforts to find a new
site for the center are sincere. "I don't want to give
the impression that we are having any trouble with
the University."
Shaw described the problem of relocating the
center as one of "trying to pull together the pieces
of a complex situation." However, he assured, "It is
very clear that we will do something. We aren't
going to abandon the Childrens' Center."
Meanwhile, Childrens' Center Director Francis
Roth expressed what may be the sentiment of many
of those who use the center, "Our real fear is, will
they really move us? Until they say, here is the
money and here are the buildings you can use, we
won't really feel secure."
