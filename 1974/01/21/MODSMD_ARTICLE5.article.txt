# Lyman Warns Faculty Of Economic 'Crunch'
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
President Richard Lyman Friday
warned faculty members to expect a
"fairly tough" financial situation for
the University "next year and in the
next several years."
Addressing the winter quarter
meeting of the Academic Council,
Lyman noted that even though both
the fund-raising Campaign for
Stanford and the belt-tightening
Budget Adjustment Program are on
schedule, Stanford still faces a "severe
crunch" on income. He cited no
specific figures, but pointed to general
trends.
Referring to the University's
budget, Lyman said, '"The problem is

on the income side of the ledger.
Expenditures are not out of line with
forecasts."
The five-year $300 million
Campaign for Stanford has netted the
University "a handsome influx of gifts
and pledges so far," Lyman said, but it
"has had no more than a very limited
impact so far on the flow of current
income."
'Limited Impact'
One of the reasons he cited for that
limited impact was that approximately
two-thirds of the money collected will
go to endowment and buildings,
neither of which would aid in
combating an immediate budget
deficit.
The drive has also brought in a
higher percentage of restricted grants
than previous campaigns, Lyman
added.' Specified money often is not
directly applicable to general
University expenses.
Lyman described the shift toward
restricted grants as "a national
phenomenon.
"People want to know what they're
giving for, and whether what they gave
was used as intended — it needn't be
any more ominous than that," he
remarked.
Added Difficulties
He also attributed difficulties in
raising general income funds to a
number of external national crises:
"the crisis in government, the energy
crisis, the collapse of the stock
market."
Not only are donors more reluctant
to give money now, but "one cannot
give appreciated securities if one's
portfolio consists of depreciated
ones," according to Lyman.
The fall in the stock market has
also hurt the University by decreasing
the amount of income normally
derived from present endowment,
Lyman said.
Falling federal support for
universities and lower graduate

enrollments have also helped bring on
the "squeeze," he added.
"We've done very well, swimming
against the tide in the matter of
attracting research support against a
dwindling source in Washington; it
may be that we've gone about as far as
one can hope to go in that direction.
"Recent months show a worrisome
downturn in both new awards and
renewals," he explained.
While graduate enrollment has
dropped 700 from its peak in 1966-67,
"the same faculty are here, with or
without graduate students," he said.
Financial Aid
"However, losses in outside awards
have caused the pressure on graduate
financial aid from Stanford sources to
remain unrelieved, despite the lower
enrollments" in graduate schools here.
Lyman concluded, however, by
noting, "I say all of this not to spread
alarm. We are not foundering, and
compared to some other places we are
in pretty good condition."
Lyman also delivered a lengthy
critique of The Other Stanford, a
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) report
assessing relationships between
professors and undergraduates. He
criticized the report's shortcomings,
but cautioned the audience not to
ignore the report because of its flaws.
SWOPSI Panel Criticized
He criticized the SWOPSI panel for
"a shortage of institutional memory"
in reaching its conclusion that the
modern Stanford has engendered "a
condition which is best characterized
by an ethos of impersonality and low
levels of interaction between faculty
and students."
Lyman quoted precedents from
1934 and 1909 echoing the panel's
results and suggested that while the
professor-student problem was real,
the SWOPSI report rested on
"intuitive assumption rather than on
