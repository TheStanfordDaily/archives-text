# Music Format Sparks Debate
## KZSU Split Over Programming 
### DON COX First Of Two Parts 
The ideological discord that arises
in organizations that cater to the
diverse desires and tastes of the
student body is evident at the
Stanford radio station, KZSU.
Internal station politics center on a
new programming format that
Programming Director Francis
Dickerson recently installed. Under
the plan programmers are required to
play six selections per hour from a list
of singles and albums that Dickerson
compiles weekly.
"The idea of the format is to play
what we think the audience wants to
hear and thereby reach more Stanford
students. The only question is, of
course, interpreting the audience's
needs," said Dickerson.
Mike Windes, former programming
director and now public affairs
director, approves of the plan. "The
concept behind the format is to give
the audience what it wants, to
maintain that audience, and to serve

them," he said.
Objecting to the new policy, senior
Cory Boy an, programmer and
engineer, echoes the sentiments of
most format opponents. "The format
stifles the creativity of the
programmer and breaks up the
continuity of the show," he contested.
Boyan said the format takes almost
one half hour to complete. The format
must be followed once every hour.
Format Called Restrictive
"The format can be extremely
restrictive and keep me from doing the
show I might have done and enjoying
myself," Boyan continued.
As it now stands, the new format
requires the programmer to play the
six cuts from a list which is broken
down into about 30 "A" singles, 30
"A" albums, 20 "B" artists, and 4 "A"
artists.
"A" and "B" Artists
The "A" artists are the Rolling
Stones, the Beatles, Simon and
Garfunkel and Bob Dylan. "B" artists
include Elton John, the Doobie
Brothers, Jim Croce, Steve Miller and
Neil Diamond. A few random "A"
singles are Ann Murray's Love Song,
Linda Ronstadt's Love Has No Pride,
Ringo Starr's You Ye Sixteen, and
Emerson, Lake and Palmer's Still You
Turn Me On. "A" albums include ones
by John Denver, Bob Dylan, Gordon

Lightfoot and the Allman Brothers.
Mike Lopez, defeated by Dickerson
for the position of programming
director in the station's recent
election, advocates more careful
review of the format cuts.
"I understand the reasoning behind
the format, but the cuts on the list are
poorly selected," he said.
Lopez also notes that "the format
provides direction for newcomers,
giving them a base to work with" that
is very helpful. ,
Senior Sid Gospe, an experienced
engineer, similarly felt that some of
the music on the format "was not the
most popular around. The format is a
good idea if it can spark interest in the
station," he added.
In a letter to the Daily, Paul Wells,
a former music director and
programmer, said "while I don't think
a format of some sort is necessarily a
bad idea, I do think that the way the
format was drawn up and the direction
it imposes is absurd in light of the
direction of radio in this area, and
among college radio stations. The
present format at KZSU is an uneven
attempt to appeal to the lowest
common denominator, and play things
from the charts."
Dickerson said he "was willing to
listen to anybody on the subject of
format music selection" and was eager
to get suggestions from the
programmers. He explained that he
decided what to put on the format list
by studying local sales, trade
magazines and other radio stations. "It

is a subjective judgement," he readily
admits.
The inclusion of some 'Top 40"
singles has prompted criticism that
KZSU is becoming bubble-gummish.
Dickerson retorts, however, that
"there is no way one can say KZSU is
bubble-gummish. We stay far away
from cuts that are below Stanford
students age-wise or overplayed."
'The purpose of the format is not
to let the D.J. play his favorite
records, but to give the audience what
it wants," emphasized Bob Fuss,
former news director. "There needs to
be more organization to the music
played, which is the idea of the
format," he added.
More Professional Attitude
Dickerson said the station needs a
more professional attitude.
"Accordingly, the audience and not
the D.J.'s are the most important
thing. We're lost if we don't realize
this. Naturally a lot of people are
upset since having a format implies
that they're not quite good enough to

do their own show, but the programs
need some direction. The free days are
over and most would say that this is
good," he said.
Senior Al Gheri maintains that "the
format is tied to a particular taste that
wrecks up continuity. To make it
relevant 24 hours per day really cuts
down on creativity." Gaheri, a
programmer, advocates an optional
format.
Special Programs Exempt
Programmer Boyan also objects to
the non-uniform application of the
format. Special programs like Black
Air, jazz and classical shows among
others are exempt from the format
requirement.
Dickerson says he "trusts the
programmers organizing the special
shows to format them properly" with
respect to the subject being presented,
since he lacks expertise in the fields.
Dickerson, who has had experience
in programming at professional radio
stations, feels he does know enough to
suggest a format for the other shows.
