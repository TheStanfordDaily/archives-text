Sensitivity Needed
Editor:
Last Tuesday, Jan. 15, the Daily
devoted prominent front-page space to
Ms. Spiegel's article "Mr. Chang:
Watchman Living on 15 Cents A Day."
It might just have well been left in the
typewriter. As a "human interest"
story, it was a bitter disappointment.
However, the sensationalistic language
and journalistic devices were the real
shockers.
Regrettably, the author could only
convey the personal eccentricities of
Mr. Chang in tasteless racial epithets
and hyperboles. We had assumed the
Daily would be more sensitive to
minority groups and ethnic
stereotypes. We now wonder.

Editor:
When will journalists as yourselves
realize that such articles as "Mr.
Chang: Watchman Living on 15 Cents
A Day" (Daily, Tues. Jan. 15), are not
going to slip into the history of racist
caricature, free from criticism?
Ms. Spiegel, may I submit that your
sub-conscious store (I'm assuming
this), of racist vilification "colored"
your reporting of Mr. Chang's
lifestyle?
Yep, you picked up on almost all
the oldies — swallowed Charlie Chan —
hook, line, sinker — buck buck begaw:
1) "He roves through the premises
like an emperor strolling through
gardens. Haskin calls him 'our old
retainer.' "
Mr. Chang, as your article attests
to, is clparly not the emperor, but I
passed that up in my first reading.
"Literary," I thought, "even though
she inserts the chinee' house-boy
image in there; someone Ms. Running
brings bananas to.
2) "Mr. Chang lives on 15 Cents a
day."
This may be true, but it's all
laughed off by declaring that he can
"appall even his idol, Ben Franklin."
Well, now we have an imperial-Hop
Sing-Mk 11-"penny-pinching" — who
just happens to be an old, forgotten
man. Ms. Spiegel, you should have
reconsidered the inclusion of your
observation that he was buck-toothed,
to boot. Take the First.
3) "To him, it's a matter of
principle to live like a poor Chinese,"
Haskins explains . . .
Sure hope this doesn't imply all
poor Chinese consider it as a matter of
principle to live "poor . . ." I'll pass up
the "fatherly foresight. . ." line, but
don't think I'm quietly preservin'
some o' dat chinee' cultcha — space
limits.
Classic:
4) "He wants to save them from the
laziness which spoiled his uncles back
in their profligate, opium-smoking
days (italics mine) before the
revolution ..."
Before I lay off, I have one
question: If the above statement is
true concerning Mr. Chang's uncles,
then where is the evidence to
substantiate this claim?
If this "opium" epithet is false*and
just pure racist garnishing, then I
request a public apology from Ms.
Spiegel and the Opinions Editor of the
Daily. Such an apology should be
made specifically to the Asian
community at Stanford University for
a grossly unfair, unsympathetic, racist
portrayal of a human being who
happens to be Chinese.
Should Ms. Spiegel's story
concerning Mr. Chang be true then
may I respectfully suggest that the
Daily lend any necessary and proper
support to Mr. Chang should he
decide, of his own will, to enter into
negotiations with his employers
concerning any possible inequities
between wages and hours. I am sure
your readership will follow with
interest any changes in Mr. Chang's
current lifestyle which he chooses to
effect.
Let me leave you with this little
piece of information which is quite
pertinent due to the plethora of
sword-flicks being screened these
halcyon days: Brother Frank put it
this way:
"A sheathed sword in the right
hand is a sign of trust.
You can't draw your sword when
its sheathed in your sword hand.
Shifting it to your left hand is a
warning ..."
My sword is sheathed, but in my
left hand now, and don't you know
just how many of us there really are,
don't you?

Don't Blame The Directory
Editor:
The old saying goes "if you want
something done well, do it yourself."
Therefore when I transferred from
CIR to SEL last August 6, I did just
what the Faculty-Staff Directory said
to do on the inside of the cover, and
on Page 1, and that is to fill out a SU-2
(it was SU 6 then), give it to your
department secretary, who will route
it to the Personnel Office. It says
Personnel then notifies Payroll,
Telephone Service, Mail Room, and
the Registrar's Office. Apparently my
SU form, which I promptly filled out,
went through all the channels, because
my name and other information
appears correctly in the new

Faculty-Staff Directory.
I am well aware that Thomas A.
Senior Research Associate in
Durand and SEL, is correct when he
ays that there are many errors in the
Directory right here in SEL, with
Dhone extensions, room numbers, etc.,
aut I'm not sure that the individuals in
question even started the corrections
:>n their way, by filling out the proper
"orm. This should not be too difficult
o discover, if anyone cared enough to
commence an investigation. Why
Dlame the Directory?

In reply to Steven Root's letter to
the editor, "Planned Disaster," Jan.
17:
Root's words and ideas seem to
have been lifted directly from Ayn
Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a work which
had a large following twenty years ago,
but which few now take seriously. In
her book, Rand pleads for the freedom
of the rational, productive self, and
decries government intervention and
control in the field of economy and
production.
Government bureaucrats are
'parasites" who "live off the
production like so many parasites
stunting the growth of a host." The
climax of the novel is the moment
when John Gait, inventor and the
symbol of the producer, tells the
bureaucrats to "get the hell out of my
way." Root states that the energy
crisis has been planned by parasitic
bureaucrats feeding off the producers
in order to gain power. He states that
the solution to the energy crisis is to
"get them (the bureaucrats) the hell
out of the way."
Root and Rand are extremely naive
concerning present-day capitalist
economics. The image of the heroic
producer, standing at the head of
industry, is no longer viable as it may
have been at the beginning of the
industrial revolution. As the capitalist
economy grows, corporations and
businesses begin to absorb one
another, and the wealth and economic
power gets concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. Profits are made, not by
the legitimate rule of supply and
demand, but by monopolistic
methods. Corporations, as well as
government bureaucrats, arc after
power.
The energy 7 crisis has been
manufactured, but not in the way that
Root has described. It has been
manufactured by the oil companies
with government support, and the
purpose is the relaxation of
environmental laws, increased profits,
and more power through the
shut-down of small, independent
companies.
Oil companies began to decrease
their production long before the crisis,
and they are now making more money
than ever before. The actions of the
Arab states are actually irrelevant to
the situation; the Arabs supplied only
five percent of this country's oil.
The O.K. granted to off-shore
drilling and the Alaskan Pipeline shows
the success of the oil companies in this
crisis. Nixon has been their man since
the beginning of his political career;
they supported him in his
vice-presidential bid, and they are
supporting him now. The solution to
the energy crisis is not only the end of
corrupt government practices. The
solution must also include restraint
upon the companies who are making
profits, not by competent production,
but by a systematic screw of the
American public.

A Fine Balance
Editor:
It is embarrassing to admit that the
Director of the Center for East Asian
Studies did not know the identity —
existence, even — of Mr. Chang
Chung-kuei. On the other hand, it was
a delight to read about him in Claire
Spiegel's beautifully crafted article
(Tuesday, Jan. 15). I now realize that
a figure I have seen from time to time
on campus, and wondered about
without inquiring, could only be Mr.
Chang. Perhaps he would want it that
way.
Mr. Chang seems to embody the
teaching of Lao-tzu:
Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Block the passages.
Shut the doors,
Let all sharpness be blunted,
All tangles untied,
All glare tempered,
All dust smoothed.
This is called the mysterious
levelling.
He who has achieved it cannot
either be drawn into friendship
or repelled,
Cannot be benefited, cannot be
harmed.
Cannot either be raised or humbled,
And for that very reason is the
highest of all creatures under
heaven.
Except that Mr. Chang's retreat is
not some misty, pine-clad mountain
out of Sung landscape painting, but
the physics department at Stanford.
Reporter Spiegel has struck a fine
balance between humor and respect —
with just a touch of the wonder that
comes in the presence of the Tao. I
presume the story is accurate; if not, I
don't want to know about it.

Before I lay off, I have one
question: If the above statement is
true concerning Mr. Chang's uncles,
then where is the evidence to
substantiate this claim?
If this "opium" epithet is false*and
just pure racist garnishing, then I
request a public apology from Ms.
Spiegel and the Opinions Editor of the
Daily. Such an apology should be
made specifically to the Asian
community at Stanford University for
a grossly unfair, unsympathetic, racist
portrayal of a human being who
happens to be Chinese.
Should Ms. Spiegel's story
concerning Mr. Chang be true then
may I respectfully suggest that the
Daily lend any necessary and proper
support to Mr. Chang should he
decide, of his own will, to enter into
negotiations with his employers
concerning any possible inequities
between wages and hours. I am sure
your readership will follow with
interest any changes in Mr. Chang's
current lifestyle which he chooses to
effect.
Let me leave you with this little
piece of information which is quite
pertinent due to the plethora of
sword-flicks being screened these
halcyon days: Brother Frank put it
this way:
"A sheathed sword in the right
hand is a sign of trust.
You can't draw your sword when
its sheathed in your sword hand.
Shifting it to your left hand is a
warning ..."
My sword is sheathed, but in my
left hand now, and don't you know
just how many of us there really are,

Don't Blame The Directory

The old saying goes "if you want
something done well, do it yourself."
Therefore when I transferred from
CIR to SEL last August 6, I did just
what the Faculty-Staff Directory said
to do on the inside of the cover, and
on Page 1, and that is to fill out a SU-2
(it was SU 6 then), give it to your
department secretary, who will route
it to the Personnel Office. It says
Personnel then notifies Payroll,
Telephone Service, Mail Room, and
the Registrar's Office. Apparently my
SU form, which I promptly filled out,
went through all the channels, because
my name and other information
appears correctly in the new

Faculty-Staff Directory.
I am well aware that Thomas A.
Senior Research Associate in

ays that there are many errors in the

Dhone extensions, room numbers, etc.,

In reply to Steven Root's letter to
the editor, "Planned Disaster," Jan.
17:
Root's words and ideas seem to
have been lifted directly from Ayn
Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a work which
had a large following twenty years ago,
but which few now take seriously. In
her book, Rand pleads for the freedom
of the rational, productive self, and
decries government intervention and
control in the field of economy and
production.
Government bureaucrats are
'parasites" who "live off the
production like so many parasites
stunting the growth of a host." The
climax of the novel is the moment
when John Gait, inventor and the
symbol of the producer, tells the
bureaucrats to "get the hell out of my
way." Root states that the energy
crisis has been planned by parasitic
bureaucrats feeding off the producers
in order to gain power. He states that
the solution to the energy crisis is to
"get them (the bureaucrats) the hell
out of the way."
Root and Rand are extremely naive
concerning present-day capitalist
economics. The image of the heroic
producer, standing at the head of
industry, is no longer viable as it may
have been at the beginning of the
industrial revolution. As the capitalist
economy grows, corporations and
businesses begin to absorb one
another, and the wealth and economic
power gets concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. Profits are made, not by
the legitimate rule of supply and
demand, but by monopolistic
methods. Corporations, as well as
government bureaucrats, arc after
power.
The energy 7 crisis has been
manufactured, but not in the way that
Root has described. It has been
manufactured by the oil companies
with government support, and the
purpose is the relaxation of
environmental laws, increased profits,
and more power through the
shut-down of small, independent
companies.
Oil companies began to decrease
their production long before the crisis,
and they are now making more money
than ever before. The actions of the
Arab states are actually irrelevant to
the situation; the Arabs supplied only
five percent of this country's oil.
The O.K. granted to off-shore
drilling and the Alaskan Pipeline shows
the success of the oil companies in this
crisis. Nixon has been their man since
the beginning of his political career;
they supported him in his
vice-presidential bid, and they are
supporting him now. The solution to
the energy crisis is not only the end of
corrupt government practices. The
solution must also include restraint
upon the companies who are making
profits, not by competent production,
but by a systematic screw of the
American public.

A Fine Balance
Editor:
It is embarrassing to admit that the
Director of the Center for East Asian
Studies did not know the identity —
existence, even — of Mr. Chang
Chung-kuei. On the other hand, it was
a delight to read about him in Claire
Spiegel's beautifully crafted article
(Tuesday, Jan. 15). I now realize that
a figure I have seen from time to time
on campus, and wondered about
without inquiring, could only be Mr.
Chang. Perhaps he would want it that
way.
Mr. Chang seems to embody the
teaching of Lao-tzu:
Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Block the passages.
Shut the doors,
Let all sharpness be blunted,
All tangles untied,
All glare tempered,
All dust smoothed.
This is called the mysterious
levelling.
He who has achieved it cannot
either be drawn into friendship
or repelled,
Cannot be benefited, cannot be
harmed.
Cannot either be raised or humbled,
And for that very reason is the
highest of all creatures under
heaven.
Except that Mr. Chang's retreat is
not some misty, pine-clad mountain
out of Sung landscape painting, but
the physics department at Stanford.
Reporter Spiegel has struck a fine
balance between humor and respect —
with just a touch of the wonder that
comes in the presence of the Tao. I
presume the story is accurate; if not, I
don't want to know about it.

Last Tuesday, Jan. 15, the Daily
devoted prominent front-page space to
Ms. Spiegel's article "Mr. Chang:
Watchman Living on 15 Cents A Day."
It might just have well been left in the
typewriter. As a "human interest"
story, it was a bitter disappointment.
However, the sensationalistic language
and journalistic devices were the real
shockers.
Regrettably, the author could only
convey the personal eccentricities of
Mr. Chang in tasteless racial epithets
and hyperboles. We had assumed the
Daily would be more sensitive to
minority groups and ethnic
stereotypes. We now wonder.

"Literary," I thought, "even though

In reply to Steven Root's letter to
the editor, "Planned Disaster," Jan.
17:
Root's words and ideas seem to
have been lifted directly from Ayn
Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a work which
had a large following twenty years ago,
but which few now take seriously. In
her book, Rand pleads for the freedom
of the rational, productive self, and
decries government intervention and
control in the field of economy and
production.
Government bureaucrats are
'parasites" who "live off the
production like so many parasites
stunting the growth of a host." The
climax of the novel is the moment
when John Gait, inventor and the
symbol of the producer, tells the
bureaucrats to "get the hell out of my
way." Root states that the energy
crisis has been planned by parasitic
bureaucrats feeding off the producers
in order to gain power. He states that
the solution to the energy crisis is to
"get them (the bureaucrats) the hell
out of the way."
Root and Rand are extremely naive
concerning present-day capitalist
economics. The image of the heroic
producer, standing at the head of
industry, is no longer viable as it may
have been at the beginning of the
industrial revolution. As the capitalist
economy grows, corporations and
businesses begin to absorb one
another, and the wealth and economic
power gets concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. Profits are made, not by
the legitimate rule of supply and
demand, but by monopolistic
methods. Corporations, as well as
government bureaucrats, arc after
power.
The energy 7 crisis has been
manufactured, but not in the way that
Root has described. It has been
manufactured by the oil companies
with government support, and the
purpose is the relaxation of
environmental laws, increased profits,
and more power through the
shut-down of small, independent
companies.
Oil companies began to decrease
their production long before the crisis,
and they are now making more money
than ever before. The actions of the
Arab states are actually irrelevant to
the situation; the Arabs supplied only
five percent of this country's oil.
The O.K. granted to off-shore
drilling and the Alaskan Pipeline shows
the success of the oil companies in this
crisis. Nixon has been their man since
the beginning of his political career;
they supported him in his
vice-presidential bid, and they are
supporting him now. The solution to
the energy crisis is not only the end of
corrupt government practices. The
solution must also include restraint
upon the companies who are making
profits, not by competent production,
but by a systematic screw of the
American public.

A Fine Balance
Editor:
It is embarrassing to admit that the
Director of the Center for East Asian
Studies did not know the identity —
existence, even — of Mr. Chang
Chung-kuei. On the other hand, it was
a delight to read about him in Claire
Spiegel's beautifully crafted article
(Tuesday, Jan. 15). I now realize that
a figure I have seen from time to time
on campus, and wondered about
without inquiring, could only be Mr.
Chang. Perhaps he would want it that
way.
Mr. Chang seems to embody the
teaching of Lao-tzu:
Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Block the passages.
Shut the doors,
Let all sharpness be blunted,
All tangles untied,
All glare tempered,
All dust smoothed.
This is called the mysterious
levelling.
He who has achieved it cannot
either be drawn into friendship
or repelled,
Cannot be benefited, cannot be
harmed.
Cannot either be raised or humbled,
And for that very reason is the
highest of all creatures under
heaven.
Except that Mr. Chang's retreat is
not some misty, pine-clad mountain
out of Sung landscape painting, but
the physics department at Stanford.
Reporter Spiegel has struck a fine
balance between humor and respect —
with just a touch of the wonder that
comes in the presence of the Tao. I
presume the story is accurate; if not, I
don't want to know about it.

Editor:
Last Tuesday, Jan. 15, the Daily
devoted prominent front-page space to
Ms. Spiegel's article "Mr. Chang:
Watchman Living on 15 Cents A Day."
It might just have well been left in the
typewriter. As a "human interest"
story, it was a bitter disappointment.
However, the sensationalistic language
and journalistic devices were the real
shockers.
Regrettably, the author could only
convey the personal eccentricities of
Mr. Chang in tasteless racial epithets
and hyperboles. We had assumed the
Daily would be more sensitive to
minority groups and ethnic
stereotypes. We now wonder.

When will journalists as yourselves
realize that such articles as "Mr.
Chang: Watchman Living on 15 Cents
A Day" (Daily, Tues. Jan. 15), are not
going to slip into the history of racist
caricature, free from criticism?
Ms. Spiegel, may I submit that your
sub-conscious store (I'm assuming
this), of racist vilification "colored"
your reporting of Mr. Chang's
lifestyle?
Yep, you picked up on almost all
the oldies — swallowed Charlie Chan —
hook, line, sinker — buck buck begaw:
1) "He roves through the premises
like an emperor strolling through
gardens. Haskin calls him 'our old
retainer.' "
Mr. Chang, as your article attests
to, is clparly not the emperor, but I
passed that up in my first reading.
"Literary," I thought, "even though
she inserts the chinee' house-boy
image in there; someone Ms. Running
brings bananas to.
2) "Mr. Chang lives on 15 Cents a
day."
This may be true, but it's all
laughed off by declaring that he can
"appall even his idol, Ben Franklin."
Well, now we have an imperial-Hop
Sing-Mk 11-"penny-pinching" — who
just happens to be an old, forgotten
man. Ms. Spiegel, you should have
reconsidered the inclusion of your
observation that he was buck-toothed,
to boot. Take the First.
3) "To him, it's a matter of
principle to live like a poor Chinese,"
Haskins explains . . .
Sure hope this doesn't imply all
poor Chinese consider it as a matter of
principle to live "poor . . ." I'll pass up
the "fatherly foresight. . ." line, but
don't think I'm quietly preservin'
some o' dat chinee' cultcha — space
limits.
Classic:
4) "He wants to save them from the
laziness which spoiled his uncles back
in their profligate, opium-smoking
days (italics mine) before the
revolution ..."
Before I lay off, I have one
question: If the above statement is
true concerning Mr. Chang's uncles,
then where is the evidence to
substantiate this claim?
If this "opium" epithet is false*and
just pure racist garnishing, then I
request a public apology from Ms.
Spiegel and the Opinions Editor of the
Daily. Such an apology should be
made specifically to the Asian
community at Stanford University for
a grossly unfair, unsympathetic, racist
portrayal of a human being who
happens to be Chinese.
Should Ms. Spiegel's story
concerning Mr. Chang be true then
may I respectfully suggest that the
Daily lend any necessary and proper
support to Mr. Chang should he
decide, of his own will, to enter into
negotiations with his employers
concerning any possible inequities
between wages and hours. I am sure
your readership will follow with
interest any changes in Mr. Chang's
current lifestyle which he chooses to
effect.
Let me leave you with this little
piece of information which is quite
pertinent due to the plethora of
sword-flicks being screened these
halcyon days: Brother Frank put it
this way:
"A sheathed sword in the right
hand is a sign of trust.
You can't draw your sword when
its sheathed in your sword hand.
Shifting it to your left hand is a
warning ..."
My sword is sheathed, but in my

production.
Government bureaucrats are
'parasites" who "live off the
production like so many parasites
stunting the growth of a host." The
climax of the novel is the moment
when John Gait, inventor and the
symbol of the producer, tells the
bureaucrats to "get the hell out of my
way." Root states that the energy
crisis has been planned by parasitic
bureaucrats feeding off the producers
in order to gain power. He states that
the solution to the energy crisis is to
"get them (the bureaucrats) the hell
out of the way."
Root and Rand are extremely naive
concerning present-day capitalist
economics. The image of the heroic
producer, standing at the head of
industry, is no longer viable as it may
have been at the beginning of the
industrial revolution. As the capitalist
economy grows, corporations and
businesses begin to absorb one
another, and the wealth and economic
power gets concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. Profits are made, not by
the legitimate rule of supply and
demand, but by monopolistic
methods. Corporations, as well as
government bureaucrats, arc after
power.
The energy 7 crisis has been
manufactured, but not in the way that
Root has described. It has been
manufactured by the oil companies
with government support, and the
purpose is the relaxation of
environmental laws, increased profits,
and more power through the
shut-down of small, independent
companies.
Oil companies began to decrease
their production long before the crisis,
and they are now making more money
than ever before. The actions of the
Arab states are actually irrelevant to
the situation; the Arabs supplied only
five percent of this country's oil.
The O.K. granted to off-shore
drilling and the Alaskan Pipeline shows
the success of the oil companies in this
crisis. Nixon has been their man since
the beginning of his political career;
they supported him in his
vice-presidential bid, and they are
supporting him now. The solution to
the energy crisis is not only the end of
corrupt government practices. The
solution must also include restraint
upon the companies who are making
profits, not by competent production,
but by a systematic screw of the
American public.

Editor:
It is embarrassing to admit that the
Director of the Center for East Asian
Studies did not know the identity —
existence, even — of Mr. Chang
Chung-kuei. On the other hand, it was
a delight to read about him in Claire
Spiegel's beautifully crafted article
(Tuesday, Jan. 15). I now realize that
a figure I have seen from time to time
on campus, and wondered about
without inquiring, could only be Mr.
Chang. Perhaps he would want it that
way.
Mr. Chang seems to embody the
teaching of Lao-tzu:
Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Block the passages.
Shut the doors,
Let all sharpness be blunted,
All tangles untied,
All glare tempered,
All dust smoothed.
This is called the mysterious
levelling.
He who has achieved it cannot
either be drawn into friendship
or repelled,
Cannot be benefited, cannot be
harmed.
Cannot either be raised or humbled,
And for that very reason is the
highest of all creatures under
heaven.
Except that Mr. Chang's retreat is
not some misty, pine-clad mountain
out of Sung landscape painting, but
the physics department at Stanford.
Reporter Spiegel has struck a fine
balance between humor and respect —
with just a touch of the wonder that
comes in the presence of the Tao. I
presume the story is accurate; if not, I
don't want to know about it.

Last Tuesday, Jan. 15, the Daily
devoted prominent front-page space to
Ms. Spiegel's article "Mr. Chang:
Watchman Living on 15 Cents A Day."
It might just have well been left in the
typewriter. As a "human interest"
story, it was a bitter disappointment.
However, the sensationalistic language
and journalistic devices were the real
shockers.
Regrettably, the author could only
convey the personal eccentricities of
Mr. Chang in tasteless racial epithets
and hyperboles. We had assumed the
Daily would be more sensitive to
minority groups and ethnic
stereotypes. We now wonder.

When will journalists as yourselves
realize that such articles as "Mr.
Chang: Watchman Living on 15 Cents
A Day" (Daily, Tues. Jan. 15), are not
going to slip into the history of racist
caricature, free from criticism?
Ms. Spiegel, may I submit that your
sub-conscious store (I'm assuming
this), of racist vilification "colored"
your reporting of Mr. Chang's
lifestyle?
Yep, you picked up on almost all
the oldies — swallowed Charlie Chan —
hook, line, sinker — buck buck begaw:
1) "He roves through the premises
like an emperor strolling through
gardens. Haskin calls him 'our old
retainer.' "
Mr. Chang, as your article attests
to, is clparly not the emperor, but I
passed that up in my first reading.
"Literary," I thought, "even though
she inserts the chinee' house-boy
image in there; someone Ms. Running
brings bananas to.
2) "Mr. Chang lives on 15 Cents a
day."
This may be true, but it's all
laughed off by declaring that he can
"appall even his idol, Ben Franklin."
Well, now we have an imperial-Hop
Sing-Mk 11-"penny-pinching" — who
just happens to be an old, forgotten
man. Ms. Spiegel, you should have
reconsidered the inclusion of your
observation that he was buck-toothed,
to boot. Take the First.
3) "To him, it's a matter of
principle to live like a poor Chinese,"
Haskins explains . . .
Sure hope this doesn't imply all
poor Chinese consider it as a matter of
principle to live "poor . . ." I'll pass up
the "fatherly foresight. . ." line, but
don't think I'm quietly preservin'
some o' dat chinee' cultcha — space
limits.
Classic:
4) "He wants to save them from the
laziness which spoiled his uncles back
in their profligate, opium-smoking
days (italics mine) before the
revolution ..."
Before I lay off, I have one
question: If the above statement is
true concerning Mr. Chang's uncles,
then where is the evidence to
substantiate this claim?
If this "opium" epithet is false*and
just pure racist garnishing, then I
request a public apology from Ms.
Spiegel and the Opinions Editor of the
Daily. Such an apology should be
made specifically to the Asian
community at Stanford University for
a grossly unfair, unsympathetic, racist
portrayal of a human being who
happens to be Chinese.
Should Ms. Spiegel's story
concerning Mr. Chang be true then
may I respectfully suggest that the
Daily lend any necessary and proper
support to Mr. Chang should he
decide, of his own will, to enter into
negotiations with his employers
concerning any possible inequities
between wages and hours. I am sure
your readership will follow with
interest any changes in Mr. Chang's
current lifestyle which he chooses to
effect.
Let me leave you with this little
piece of information which is quite
pertinent due to the plethora of
sword-flicks being screened these
halcyon days: Brother Frank put it
this way:
"A sheathed sword in the right
hand is a sign of trust.
You can't draw your sword when
its sheathed in your sword hand.
Shifting it to your left hand is a
warning ..."
My sword is sheathed, but in my
left hand now, and don't you know
just how many of us there really are,
don't you?

Therefore when I transferred from

what the Faculty-Staff Directory said
to do on the inside of the cover, and

department secretary, who will route
it to the Personnel Office. It says
Personnel then notifies Payroll,
Telephone Service, Mail Room, and
the Registrar's Office. Apparently my
SU form, which I promptly filled out,
went through all the channels, because
my name and other information
appears correctly in the new

Faculty-Staff Directory.
I am well aware that Thomas A.
Senior Research Associate in

ays that there are many errors in the

Dhone extensions, room numbers, etc.,
aut I'm not sure that the individuals in

Editor:
It is embarrassing to admit that the
Director of the Center for East Asian
Studies did not know the identity —
existence, even — of Mr. Chang
Chung-kuei. On the other hand, it was
a delight to read about him in Claire
Spiegel's beautifully crafted article
(Tuesday, Jan. 15). I now realize that
a figure I have seen from time to time
on campus, and wondered about
without inquiring, could only be Mr.
Chang. Perhaps he would want it that
way.
Mr. Chang seems to embody the
teaching of Lao-tzu:
Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Block the passages.
Shut the doors,
Let all sharpness be blunted,
All tangles untied,
All glare tempered,
All dust smoothed.
This is called the mysterious
levelling.
He who has achieved it cannot
either be drawn into friendship
or repelled,
Cannot be benefited, cannot be
harmed.
Cannot either be raised or humbled,
And for that very reason is the
highest of all creatures under
heaven.
Except that Mr. Chang's retreat is
not some misty, pine-clad mountain
out of Sung landscape painting, but
the physics department at Stanford.
Reporter Spiegel has struck a fine
balance between humor and respect —
with just a touch of the wonder that
comes in the presence of the Tao. I
presume the story is accurate; if not, I
don't want to know about it.

Last Tuesday, Jan. 15, the Daily
devoted prominent front-page space to
Ms. Spiegel's article "Mr. Chang:
Watchman Living on 15 Cents A Day."
It might just have well been left in the
typewriter. As a "human interest"
story, it was a bitter disappointment.
However, the sensationalistic language
and journalistic devices were the real
shockers.
Regrettably, the author could only
convey the personal eccentricities of
Mr. Chang in tasteless racial epithets
and hyperboles. We had assumed the
Daily would be more sensitive to
minority groups and ethnic
stereotypes. We now wonder.

Racist Caricature
Editor:
When will journalists as yourselves
realize that such articles as "Mr.
Chang: Watchman Living on 15 Cents
A Day" (Daily, Tues. Jan. 15), are not
going to slip into the history of racist
caricature, free from criticism?
Ms. Spiegel, may I submit that your
sub-conscious store (I'm assuming
this), of racist vilification "colored"
your reporting of Mr. Chang's
lifestyle?
Yep, you picked up on almost all
the oldies — swallowed Charlie Chan —
hook, line, sinker — buck buck begaw:
1) "He roves through the premises
like an emperor strolling through
gardens. Haskin calls him 'our old
retainer.' "
Mr. Chang, as your article attests
to, is clparly not the emperor, but I
passed that up in my first reading.
"Literary," I thought, "even though
she inserts the chinee' house-boy
image in there; someone Ms. Running
brings bananas to.
2) "Mr. Chang lives on 15 Cents a
day."
This may be true, but it's all
laughed off by declaring that he can
"appall even his idol, Ben Franklin."
Well, now we have an imperial-Hop
Sing-Mk 11-"penny-pinching" — who
just happens to be an old, forgotten
man. Ms. Spiegel, you should have
reconsidered the inclusion of your
observation that he was buck-toothed,
to boot. Take the First.
3) "To him, it's a matter of
principle to live like a poor Chinese,"
Haskins explains . . .
Sure hope this doesn't imply all
poor Chinese consider it as a matter of
principle to live "poor . . ." I'll pass up
the "fatherly foresight. . ." line, but
don't think I'm quietly preservin'
some o' dat chinee' cultcha — space
limits.
Classic:
4) "He wants to save them from the
laziness which spoiled his uncles back
in their profligate, opium-smoking
days (italics mine) before the
revolution ..."
Before I lay off, I have one
question: If the above statement is
true concerning Mr. Chang's uncles,
then where is the evidence to
substantiate this claim?
If this "opium" epithet is false*and
just pure racist garnishing, then I
request a public apology from Ms.
Spiegel and the Opinions Editor of the
Daily. Such an apology should be
made specifically to the Asian
community at Stanford University for
a grossly unfair, unsympathetic, racist
portrayal of a human being who
happens to be Chinese.
Should Ms. Spiegel's story
concerning Mr. Chang be true then
may I respectfully suggest that the
Daily lend any necessary and proper
support to Mr. Chang should he
decide, of his own will, to enter into
negotiations with his employers
concerning any possible inequities
between wages and hours. I am sure
your readership will follow with
interest any changes in Mr. Chang's
current lifestyle which he chooses to
effect.
Let me leave you with this little
piece of information which is quite
pertinent due to the plethora of
sword-flicks being screened these
halcyon days: Brother Frank put it
this way:
"A sheathed sword in the right
hand is a sign of trust.
You can't draw your sword when
its sheathed in your sword hand.
Shifting it to your left hand is a
warning ..."
My sword is sheathed, but in my
left hand now, and don't you know
just how many of us there really are,
don't you?

Don't Blame The Directory
Editor:
The old saying goes "if you want
something done well, do it yourself."
Therefore when I transferred from
CIR to SEL last August 6, I did just
what the Faculty-Staff Directory said
to do on the inside of the cover, and
on Page 1, and that is to fill out a SU-2
(it was SU 6 then), give it to your
department secretary, who will route
it to the Personnel Office. It says
Personnel then notifies Payroll,
Telephone Service, Mail Room, and
the Registrar's Office. Apparently my
SU form, which I promptly filled out,
went through all the channels, because
my name and other information
appears correctly in the new

Faculty-Staff Directory.
I am well aware that Thomas A.
Senior Research Associate in
Durand and SEL, is correct when he
ays that there are many errors in the
Directory right here in SEL, with
Dhone extensions, room numbers, etc.,
aut I'm not sure that the individuals in
question even started the corrections
:>n their way, by filling out the proper
"orm. This should not be too difficult
o discover, if anyone cared enough to
commence an investigation. Why
Dlame the Directory?

In reply to Steven Root's letter to
the editor, "Planned Disaster," Jan.
17:
Root's words and ideas seem to
have been lifted directly from Ayn
Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a work which
had a large following twenty years ago,
but which few now take seriously. In
her book, Rand pleads for the freedom
of the rational, productive self, and
decries government intervention and
control in the field of economy and
production.
Government bureaucrats are
'parasites" who "live off the
production like so many parasites
stunting the growth of a host." The
climax of the novel is the moment
when John Gait, inventor and the
symbol of the producer, tells the
bureaucrats to "get the hell out of my
way." Root states that the energy
crisis has been planned by parasitic
bureaucrats feeding off the producers
in order to gain power. He states that
the solution to the energy crisis is to
"get them (the bureaucrats) the hell
out of the way."
Root and Rand are extremely naive
concerning present-day capitalist
economics. The image of the heroic
producer, standing at the head of
industry, is no longer viable as it may
have been at the beginning of the
industrial revolution. As the capitalist
economy grows, corporations and
businesses begin to absorb one
another, and the wealth and economic
power gets concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. Profits are made, not by
the legitimate rule of supply and
demand, but by monopolistic
methods. Corporations, as well as
government bureaucrats, arc after
power.
The energy 7 crisis has been
manufactured, but not in the way that
Root has described. It has been
manufactured by the oil companies
with government support, and the
purpose is the relaxation of
environmental laws, increased profits,
and more power through the
shut-down of small, independent
companies.
Oil companies began to decrease
their production long before the crisis,
and they are now making more money
than ever before. The actions of the
Arab states are actually irrelevant to
the situation; the Arabs supplied only
five percent of this country's oil.
The O.K. granted to off-shore
drilling and the Alaskan Pipeline shows
the success of the oil companies in this
crisis. Nixon has been their man since
the beginning of his political career;
they supported him in his
vice-presidential bid, and they are
supporting him now. The solution to
the energy crisis is not only the end of
corrupt government practices. The
solution must also include restraint
upon the companies who are making
profits, not by competent production,
but by a systematic screw of the
American public.
