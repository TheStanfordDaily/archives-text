# Women's Health Care Examined
## Task Force Offers Innovations To Cowell 
### 
Lyse Si mad

The Task Force on Women's Health Care at
Stanford was organized shortly after Dr. Massey left
Cowell. Although our immediate concern was
originally to procure a full-time gynecologist for the
3000 Stanford women, we decided to examine all
aspects of women's health care at Cowell. We also
reviewed the programs of several community health
centers and other universities, particularly Yale.
With this knowledge we agreed upon several new
programs or changes that we felt were both
important and feasible: 1) peer counseling on
contraception and sex, encouraging couple
participation in the choosing of a birth control
method, 2) eligibility of non-Stanford student
sexual partners for contraceptive care at Cowell, 3)
revisal of People Should Feel Good (or the printing
of a separate pamphlet) in order to give more
specific information about contraception and
sexuality, and finally, 4) the adoption of methods
for decreasing the wait for contraceptives to a week
or less.
The task force next held a meeting open to all
interested people in the Stanford community in
order to assess the feeling about women's health
care at Cowell. We also discussed the alternative
programs we had studied and our list of four
changes. The consensus was that although Gowell is
a fairly complete and normally efficient health
center (especially considering that each student pays
less than thirty dollars a quarter for almost all
services, including infirmary care), certain services in
terms of women's care are lacking.

We met with Dr. McClenahan shortly afterwards
to discuss our ideas. Dr. McClenahan, the Director
of Cowell, agreed that the peer counseling service
would be a constructive addition at the health
center. Eligibility for contraceptive care of
non-Stanford student sexual partners, however,
presents some difficulties. Dr. McClenahan has
written to Dr. Sorel (the Director of the Yale
Sexuality Clinic), but as yet has not received a letter
satisfactorily answering his questions about the
control of non-student care at the Yale Clinic.
Contraceptives
The wait for contraceptives at Cowell normally is
about one week (which we feel is permissible)
except during the Fall and Spring rushes at which
times the wait may be as long as three weeks.
Cowell is having a nurse trained exclusively for
contraceptive care. She will be back at Cowell in the
Spring.
Cowell has hired a part-time gynecologist. If the
wait is too long in the Spring, Cowell may consider
(but not promise) the hiring of another part-time
gynecologist and would try to hire a woman if one
is available. Dr. McClenahan was receptive to the
idea of expanding People Should Feel Good to meet
what we consider to be the requirements of a more
informative pamphlet.
We are now at the point where we have several
workable ideas, yet require the womanpower (or
personpower) to put our plans into effect. Although
we would like to offer a training course (with
University credit) in the Spring for prospective

counselors, we would also like to train people now
in order to have a functioning program at Cowell by
the beginning of Spring Quarter. We encourage
couples to volunteer to be counselors as we will
encourage patient-couples to examine birth control
methods together. We would like to offer the option
of a class or individual consultation. Call Ann
Simons (493-8010) or Lyse Strnad (326-1718) for
information. We will be coordinating the course. We
will meet this Thursday at 7:30 at Zap House.
Participation Encouraged
People interested in expanding People Should
Feel Good should call Holly Houston (327-6278)
who will arrange the first meeting of the group.
People interested in organizing a symposium on
sexuality should call Pam Wolfe (327-9066).
Some women expressed an interest in forming a
"rape squad" at Stanford which is a group of
women who assist rape victims through the process
of reporting a rape and hospital care. It is helpful to
have a woman accompany a victim to a police
station, explaining such things to her as why it is
necessary to bring a change of clothing (police often
keep the original set of clothes for examination) and
why not to shower or douche before going to the
police. No one knows how many unreported rape
cases there are on campus each year. Lyse Strnad
will organize the first meetings of such a "rape
squad" if there is interest. Call (326-1718) for
information.

Women's Health Care at Stanford and a member of
the Student Advisory Committee to Cowell.)

care at Cowell. We also discussed the alternative
programs we had studied and our list of four
changes. The consensus was that although Gowell is
a fairly complete and normally efficient health
center (especially considering that each student pays
less than thirty dollars a quarter for almost all
services, including infirmary care), certain services in
terms of women's care are lacking.

We met with Dr. McClenahan shortly afterwards
to discuss our ideas. Dr. McClenahan, the Director
of Cowell, agreed that the peer counseling service
would be a constructive addition at the health
center. Eligibility for contraceptive care of
non-Stanford student sexual partners, however,
presents some difficulties. Dr. McClenahan has
written to Dr. Sorel (the Director of the Yale
Sexuality Clinic), but as yet has not received a letter
satisfactorily answering his questions about the
control of non-student care at the Yale Clinic.
Contraceptives
The wait for contraceptives at Cowell normally is
about one week (which we feel is permissible)
except during the Fall and Spring rushes at which
times the wait may be as long as three weeks.
Cowell is having a nurse trained exclusively for
contraceptive care. She will be back at Cowell in the
Spring.
Cowell has hired a part-time gynecologist. If the
wait is too long in the Spring, Cowell may consider
(but not promise) the hiring of another part-time
gynecologist and would try to hire a woman if one
is available. Dr. McClenahan was receptive to the
idea of expanding People Should Feel Good to meet
what we consider to be the requirements of a more
informative pamphlet.
We are now at the point where we have several
workable ideas, yet require the womanpower (or
personpower) to put our plans into effect. Although
we would like to offer a training course (with
University credit) in the Spring for prospective

counselors, we would also like to train people now
in order to have a functioning program at Cowell by
the beginning of Spring Quarter. We encourage
couples to volunteer to be counselors as we will
encourage patient-couples to examine birth control
methods together. We would like to offer the option
of a class or individual consultation. Call Ann
Simons (493-8010) or Lyse Strnad (326-1718) for
information. We will be coordinating the course. We
will meet this Thursday at 7:30 at Zap House.
Participation Encouraged
People interested in expanding People Should
Feel Good should call Holly Houston (327-6278)
who will arrange the first meeting of the group.
People interested in organizing a symposium on
sexuality should call Pam Wolfe (327-9066).
Some women expressed an interest in forming a
"rape squad" at Stanford which is a group of
women who assist rape victims through the process
of reporting a rape and hospital care. It is helpful to
have a woman accompany a victim to a police
station, explaining such things to her as why it is
necessary to bring a change of clothing (police often
keep the original set of clothes for examination) and
why not to shower or douche before going to the
police. No one knows how many unreported rape
cases there are on campus each year. Lyse Strnad
will organize the first meetings of such a "rape
squad" if there is interest. Call (326-1718) for
information.

Women's Health Care at Stanford and a member of

The Task Force on Women's Health Care at
Stanford was organized shortly after Dr. Massey left
Cowell. Although our immediate concern was
originally to procure a full-time gynecologist for the
3000 Stanford women, we decided to examine all
aspects of women's health care at Cowell. We also
reviewed the programs of several community health
centers and other universities, particularly Yale.
With this knowledge we agreed upon several new
programs or changes that we felt were both
important and feasible: 1) peer counseling on
contraception and sex, encouraging couple
participation in the choosing of a birth control
method, 2) eligibility of non-Stanford student
sexual partners for contraceptive care at Cowell, 3)
revisal of People Should Feel Good (or the printing
of a separate pamphlet) in order to give more
specific information about contraception and
sexuality, and finally, 4) the adoption of methods
for decreasing the wait for contraceptives to a week
or less.

Cowell is having a nurse trained exclusively for
contraceptive care. She will be back at Cowell in the
Spring.
Cowell has hired a part-time gynecologist. If the
wait is too long in the Spring, Cowell may consider
(but not promise) the hiring of another part-time
gynecologist and would try to hire a woman if one
is available. Dr. McClenahan was receptive to the
idea of expanding People Should Feel Good to meet
what we consider to be the requirements of a more
informative pamphlet.
We are now at the point where we have several
workable ideas, yet require the womanpower (or
personpower) to put our plans into effect. Although
we would like to offer a training course (with
University credit) in the Spring for prospective

counselors, we would also like to train people now
in order to have a functioning program at Cowell by
the beginning of Spring Quarter. We encourage
couples to volunteer to be counselors as we will
encourage patient-couples to examine birth control
methods together. We would like to offer the option
of a class or individual consultation. Call Ann
Simons (493-8010) or Lyse Strnad (326-1718) for
information. We will be coordinating the course. We
will meet this Thursday at 7:30 at Zap House.
Participation Encouraged
People interested in expanding People Should
Feel Good should call Holly Houston (327-6278)
who will arrange the first meeting of the group.
People interested in organizing a symposium on
sexuality should call Pam Wolfe (327-9066).
Some women expressed an interest in forming a
"rape squad" at Stanford which is a group of
women who assist rape victims through the process
of reporting a rape and hospital care. It is helpful to
have a woman accompany a victim to a police
station, explaining such things to her as why it is
necessary to bring a change of clothing (police often
keep the original set of clothes for examination) and
why not to shower or douche before going to the
police. No one knows how many unreported rape
cases there are on campus each year. Lyse Strnad
will organize the first meetings of such a "rape
squad" if there is interest. Call (326-1718) for
information.
(Lyse Strnad is a member of the Task Force on
Women's Health Care at Stanford and a member of
the Student Advisory Committee to Cowell.)
