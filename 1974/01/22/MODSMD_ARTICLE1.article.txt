# Historian Kennedy Challenges Students To Learn
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
"David Kennedy has to be just
about the hardest professor here.
Don't take him unless you want to
work — and learn something," said a
senior recommending history courses
for this quarter.
Assoc. History Prof. David M.
Kennedy "is considered the best
Americanist of his age and rank in the
country," according to a University
biographical sketch.
Among students here, the 32-year
old Kennedy is fast gaining a
reputation as a stimulating, challenging
but extremely demanding professor —
perhaps a little too demanding for
some.
Roughly 15 percent of the students
enrolled fall quarter in Kennedy's
History 170 flunked the first exam.
The take-home final was "so hard that
when he finished lecturing, I don't
think everyone was sure whether to
applaud or to cuss him out," a
sophomore coed said.
'Eschatologically Vicious'
Kennedy is aware of the
consternation. "The evaluation sheets
in my 170 course were
eschatologically vicious. One guy
wrote on the top of his paper in
capital letters 'YOU ARE REALLY
AN ASSHOLE!,' but the guy went on
to say he liked the course."
This type of personal criticism
bothers Kennedy because "it becomes
obvious that a lot of people see me in
a very different way than I see
myself," he said.
"I don't get upset over comments
that my courses are too difficult or
that people feel they have worked too
hard. Those don't bother me in the
least. In fact, they make me kind of
happy.
"The thing that I find devastating is
the opposite — the students who find
it insufficiently challenging,
insufficiently provocative, and the
ones who really aren't made to work,"
he said.
"It makes me much happier to have
people say of me that they worked
their asses off and learned something,
rather than 'you're a good guy.' "
'Easy To Be Loved'
"It's easy though," he remarked. "I
think it's relatively easy to be loved. I
think it's a terribly seductive thing for
a teacher to do all sorts of corrupt
little things to ingratiate himself with
his students."
Kennedy has angered students by
giving poor grades to large segments of
his classes on examinations. "I don't
see why he should fail so many of
them when other professors give them
As or Bs for the same work. It's just
not fair," said one student.
Kennedy said his reputation for
failing students is greatly exaggerated.
Very few students actually fail his
courses, and he usually discards poor

grades on midterms in favor ol the
term paper and final exam grades.
Only five of 131 students flunked
History 170 last quarter.
"What I'm doing is not making a
judgment about dumbness or
smartness, but about performance in a
given area.
Takes Work Seriously
"There are people here who take
some things less seriously that
others... I take my teaching
seriously; I take American history
seriously and I think that's why I'm
here."
Kennedy graduated from Stanford
in history with honors in 1963. The
Seattle native then traveled east to
Yale University and earned his M.A. in
1964 and his Ph.D. in 1968.
Stanford History Prof. Wayne
Vucinich, from whom Kennedy took
courses as an undergraduate, described
his junior colleague as "a very
promising student. He was very
dedicated to his studies, a fast learner.
He devoured the course material; there
was never enough to satisfy him. He
could manage any assignment you gave
him."
Kennedy received job offers from
both Stanford and Yale. He accepted a
position here as acting assistant
professor of history in 1967 and
became an assistant professor in 1968.
He rose to associate professor last
year.
National Acclaim
His first book, Birth Control in
America: The Career of Margaret
Sanger, was published in 1971. The
work brought him instant national
acclaim and two prizes: the prestigious
Bancroft Prize, awarded by Columbia
University, and the John Gilmary Shea
award from the American Catholic
Historical Association.
History Department Chairman
Gordon Craig described Kennedy as "a
shrewd historian" and "one of the
stars of our department in the way
which he has attracted students, not
by tricks of showmanship, but through
well-organized, deliberately-structured
lectures. He is an exciting teacher."
Students are quick to agree.
"He's the best lecturer I've ever
had," said one student echoing the
opinion of many. "He spends a lot of
time working on his lectures."
Kennedy's reputation as an
excellent lecturer and a tough grader
precedes him, and he finds students'
expectations invigorating. "It's all very
flattering. I'm not unaware of it,"he
grinned.
"I like being expected to do a good
job or a very good job all the time and,
reciprocally, I expect the same thing
of students."
Fence Straddling
Another aspect of Kennedy's
teaching that seems to bother students
is what they view as his "fence

straddling in class," a hesitancy to
commit himself in the "hot" political
and scholarly arguments in history.
"It's odd," said one senior history
major, "because he's a left liberal, but
he seems to be scared of getting an
image as a leftist historian."
Kennedy said his positions in the
classroom are deliberately vague to
avoid "indoctrinating" his students.
He wants to present students with
many different interpretations and let
them "sift out for themselves exactly
what is the proper one."
Kennedy's main complaint with
University life is his lack of time for
writing. "I realize now in a way I never
did when I was a student how people
who really give themselves to their
students have their lives eaten up by
students.
Professors' Defenses
"Often times what students mistake
for coldness and aloofness by
professors are really defenses. The
sheer number of students can gobble
all the working hours of your day up,"
he pointed out.
Yet Kennedy does not isolate
himself from the University and his
students. For the past six years he has
served on the committee in charge of
the undergraduate humanities honors
program.
He has been especially active
recently in developing courses for the
interdepartmental American studies

program within the humanities special
programs.
He and his wife Judy have served as
resident fellows for Otero house in
Wilbur Hall for three of the last four
years. The Kennedys traveled to the
Italian overseas campus last year as
faculty residents.
"I did dilute my courses there," the
young history professor said. "They
didn't require as much reading. I don't
think I went to Italy for a paid
vacation."
Expecting the couple's first child
next month, Mrs. Kennedy plans to
take a leave of absence from her
full-time job as a social worker after
the baby is born. A native Californian
and a UC-Berkeley graduate, she plans
to return to school during her
six-month leave to obtain her master's
degree in social work.
"I don't think David rests on his
laurels. He's always striving to do
things better, revising, redoing," she
said.
And her husband's diligence does
not end with his academic work. "We
climbed Kilimanjaro and made it to
the top" last summer, she said.
"I'm sympathetic to students,"
Mrs. Kennedy commented. "I think
David expects a lot.
"He gave a wine-tasting course in
Italy. It was a very successful
non-credit course, but even his final
there was tough."

TOUGH YOUNG PROF — Assoc. History Prof. David M. Kennedy, considered
as one of the best scholars of American history of his age and rank in the
country, lectures to one of his undergrad classes. Kennedy is "so serious that he
won't lecture if anyone is reading a newspaper in class, because one person isn't
paying attention," according to one junior.
"David Kennedy has to be just
about the hardest professor here.
Don't take him unless you want to
work — and learn something," said a
senior recommending history courses
for this quarter.
Assoc. History Prof. David M.
Kennedy "is considered the best
Americanist of his age and rank in the
country," according to a University
biographical sketch.
Among students here, the 32-year
old Kennedy is fast gaining a
reputation as a stimulating, challenging
but extremely demanding professor —
perhaps a little too demanding for
some.
Roughly 15 percent of the students
enrolled fall quarter in Kennedy's
History 170 flunked the first exam.
The take-home final was "so hard that
when he finished lecturing, I don't
think everyone was sure whether to
applaud or to cuss him out," a
sophomore coed said.
'Eschatologically Vicious'
Kennedy is aware of the
consternation. "The evaluation sheets
in my 170 course were
eschatologically vicious. One guy
wrote on the top of his paper in
capital letters 'YOU ARE REALLY
AN ASSHOLE!,' but the guy went on
to say he liked the course."
This type of personal criticism
bothers Kennedy because "it becomes
obvious that a lot of people see me in
a very different way than I see
myself," he said.
"I don't get upset over comments
that my courses are too difficult or
that people feel they have worked too
hard. Those don't bother me in the
least. In fact, they make me kind of
happy.
"The thing that I find devastating is
the opposite — the students who find
it insufficiently challenging,
insufficiently provocative, and the
ones who really aren't made to work,"
he said.
"It makes me much happier to have
people say of me that they worked
their asses off and learned something,
rather than 'you're a good guy.' "
'Easy To Be Loved'
"It's easy though," he remarked. "I
think it's relatively easy to be loved. I
think it's a terribly seductive thing for
a teacher to do all sorts of corrupt
little things to ingratiate himself with
his students."
Kennedy has angered students by
giving poor grades to large segments of
his classes on examinations. "I don't
see why he should fail so many of
them when other professors give them
As or Bs for the same work. It's just
not fair," said one student.
Kennedy said his reputation for
failing students is greatly exaggerated.
Very few students actually fail his
courses, and he usually discards poor

grades on midterms in favor ol the
term paper and final exam grades.
Only five of 131 students flunked
History 170 last quarter.
"What I'm doing is not making a
judgment about dumbness or
smartness, but about performance in a
given area.
Takes Work Seriously
"There are people here who take
some things less seriously that
others... I take my teaching
seriously; I take American history
seriously and I think that's why I'm
here."
Kennedy graduated from Stanford
in history with honors in 1963. The
Seattle native then traveled east to
Yale University and earned his M.A. in
1964 and his Ph.D. in 1968.
Stanford History Prof. Wayne
Vucinich, from whom Kennedy took
courses as an undergraduate, described
his junior colleague as "a very
promising student. He was very
dedicated to his studies, a fast learner.
He devoured the course material; there
was never enough to satisfy him. He
could manage any assignment you gave
him."
Kennedy received job offers from
both Stanford and Yale. He accepted a
position here as acting assistant
professor of history in 1967 and
became an assistant professor in 1968.
He rose to associate professor last
year.
National Acclaim
His first book, Birth Control in
America: The Career of Margaret
Sanger, was published in 1971. The
work brought him instant national
acclaim and two prizes: the prestigious
Bancroft Prize, awarded by Columbia
University, and the John Gilmary Shea
award from the American Catholic
Historical Association.
History Department Chairman
Gordon Craig described Kennedy as "a
shrewd historian" and "one of the
stars of our department in the way
which he has attracted students, not
by tricks of showmanship, but through
well-organized, deliberately-structured
lectures. He is an exciting teacher."
Students are quick to agree.
"He's the best lecturer I've ever
had," said one student echoing the
opinion of many. "He spends a lot of
time working on his lectures."
Kennedy's reputation as an
excellent lecturer and a tough grader
precedes him, and he finds students'
expectations invigorating. "It's all very
flattering. I'm not unaware of it,"he
grinned.
"I like being expected to do a good
job or a very good job all the time and,
reciprocally, I expect the same thing
of students."
Fence Straddling
Another aspect of Kennedy's
teaching that seems to bother students
is what they view as his "fence

straddling in class," a hesitancy to
commit himself in the "hot" political
and scholarly arguments in history.
"It's odd," said one senior history
major, "because he's a left liberal, but
he seems to be scared of getting an
image as a leftist historian."
Kennedy said his positions in the
classroom are deliberately vague to
avoid "indoctrinating" his students.
He wants to present students with
many different interpretations and let
them "sift out for themselves exactly
what is the proper one."
Kennedy's main complaint with
University life is his lack of time for
writing. "I realize now in a way I never
did when I was a student how people
who really give themselves to their
students have their lives eaten up by
students.
Professors' Defenses
"Often times what students mistake
for coldness and aloofness by
professors are really defenses. The
sheer number of students can gobble
all the working hours of your day up,"
he pointed out.
Yet Kennedy does not isolate
himself from the University and his
students. For the past six years he has
served on the committee in charge of
the undergraduate humanities honors
program.
He has been especially active
recently in developing courses for the
interdepartmental American studies

program within the humanities special
programs.
He and his wife Judy have served as
resident fellows for Otero house in
Wilbur Hall for three of the last four
years. The Kennedys traveled to the
Italian overseas campus last year as
faculty residents.
"I did dilute my courses there," the
young history professor said. "They
didn't require as much reading. I don't
think I went to Italy for a paid
vacation."
Expecting the couple's first child
next month, Mrs. Kennedy plans to
take a leave of absence from her
full-time job as a social worker after
the baby is born. A native Californian
and a UC-Berkeley graduate, she plans
to return to school during her
six-month leave to obtain her master's
degree in social work.
"I don't think David rests on his
laurels. He's always striving to do
things better, revising, redoing," she
said.
And her husband's diligence does
not end with his academic work. "We

TOUGH YOUNG PROF — Assoc. History Prof. David M. Kennedy, considered
as one of the best scholars of American history of his age and rank in the
country, lectures to one of his undergrad classes. Kennedy is "so serious that he
won't lecture if anyone is reading a newspaper in class, because one person isn't
paying attention," according to one junior.
"David Kennedy has to be just
about the hardest professor here.
Don't take him unless you want to
work — and learn something," said a
senior recommending history courses
for this quarter.
Assoc. History Prof. David M.
Kennedy "is considered the best
Americanist of his age and rank in the
country," according to a University
biographical sketch.
Among students here, the 32-year
old Kennedy is fast gaining a
reputation as a stimulating, challenging
but extremely demanding professor —
perhaps a little too demanding for
some.
Roughly 15 percent of the students
enrolled fall quarter in Kennedy's
History 170 flunked the first exam.
The take-home final was "so hard that
when he finished lecturing, I don't
think everyone was sure whether to
applaud or to cuss him out," a
sophomore coed said.
'Eschatologically Vicious'
Kennedy is aware of the
consternation. "The evaluation sheets
in my 170 course were
eschatologically vicious. One guy
wrote on the top of his paper in
capital letters 'YOU ARE REALLY
AN ASSHOLE!,' but the guy went on
to say he liked the course."
This type of personal criticism
bothers Kennedy because "it becomes
obvious that a lot of people see me in
a very different way than I see
myself," he said.
"I don't get upset over comments
that my courses are too difficult or
that people feel they have worked too
hard. Those don't bother me in the
least. In fact, they make me kind of
happy.
"The thing that I find devastating is
the opposite — the students who find
it insufficiently challenging,
insufficiently provocative, and the
ones who really aren't made to work,"
he said.
"It makes me much happier to have
people say of me that they worked
their asses off and learned something,
rather than 'you're a good guy.' "
'Easy To Be Loved'
"It's easy though," he remarked. "I
think it's relatively easy to be loved. I
think it's a terribly seductive thing for
a teacher to do all sorts of corrupt
little things to ingratiate himself with
his students."
Kennedy has angered students by
giving poor grades to large segments of
his classes on examinations. "I don't
see why he should fail so many of
them when other professors give them
As or Bs for the same work. It's just
not fair," said one student.
Kennedy said his reputation for
failing students is greatly exaggerated.
Very few students actually fail his
courses, and he usually discards poor

grades on midterms in favor ol the
term paper and final exam grades.
Only five of 131 students flunked
History 170 last quarter.
"What I'm doing is not making a
judgment about dumbness or
smartness, but about performance in a
given area.
Takes Work Seriously
"There are people here who take
some things less seriously that
others... I take my teaching
seriously; I take American history
seriously and I think that's why I'm
here."
Kennedy graduated from Stanford
in history with honors in 1963. The
Seattle native then traveled east to
Yale University and earned his M.A. in
1964 and his Ph.D. in 1968.
Stanford History Prof. Wayne
Vucinich, from whom Kennedy took
courses as an undergraduate, described
his junior colleague as "a very
promising student. He was very
dedicated to his studies, a fast learner.
He devoured the course material; there
was never enough to satisfy him. He
could manage any assignment you gave
him."
Kennedy received job offers from
both Stanford and Yale. He accepted a
position here as acting assistant
professor of history in 1967 and
became an assistant professor in 1968.
He rose to associate professor last
year.
National Acclaim
His first book, Birth Control in
America: The Career of Margaret
Sanger, was published in 1971. The
work brought him instant national
acclaim and two prizes: the prestigious
Bancroft Prize, awarded by Columbia
University, and the John Gilmary Shea
award from the American Catholic
Historical Association.
History Department Chairman
Gordon Craig described Kennedy as "a
shrewd historian" and "one of the
stars of our department in the way
which he has attracted students, not
by tricks of showmanship, but through
well-organized, deliberately-structured
lectures. He is an exciting teacher."
Students are quick to agree.
"He's the best lecturer I've ever
had," said one student echoing the
opinion of many. "He spends a lot of
time working on his lectures."
Kennedy's reputation as an
excellent lecturer and a tough grader
precedes him, and he finds students'
expectations invigorating. "It's all very
flattering. I'm not unaware of it,"he
grinned.
"I like being expected to do a good
job or a very good job all the time and,
reciprocally, I expect the same thing
of students."
Fence Straddling
Another aspect of Kennedy's
teaching that seems to bother students
is what they view as his "fence

straddling in class," a hesitancy to
commit himself in the "hot" political
and scholarly arguments in history.
"It's odd," said one senior history
major, "because he's a left liberal, but
he seems to be scared of getting an
image as a leftist historian."
Kennedy said his positions in the
classroom are deliberately vague to
avoid "indoctrinating" his students.
He wants to present students with
many different interpretations and let
them "sift out for themselves exactly
what is the proper one."
Kennedy's main complaint with
University life is his lack of time for
writing. "I realize now in a way I never
did when I was a student how people
who really give themselves to their
students have their lives eaten up by
students.
Professors' Defenses
"Often times what students mistake
for coldness and aloofness by
professors are really defenses. The
sheer number of students can gobble
all the working hours of your day up,"
he pointed out.
Yet Kennedy does not isolate
himself from the University and his
students. For the past six years he has
served on the committee in charge of
the undergraduate humanities honors
program.
He has been especially active
recently in developing courses for the
interdepartmental American studies

program within the humanities special
programs.
He and his wife Judy have served as
resident fellows for Otero house in
Wilbur Hall for three of the last four
years. The Kennedys traveled to the
Italian overseas campus last year as
faculty residents.
"I did dilute my courses there," the
young history professor said. "They
didn't require as much reading. I don't
think I went to Italy for a paid

he pointed out.
Yet Kennedy does not isolate
himself from the University and his
students. For the past six years he has
served on the committee in charge of
the undergraduate humanities honors
program.
He has been especially active
recently in developing courses for the
interdepartmental American studies

program within the humanities special
programs.
He and his wife Judy have served as
resident fellows for Otero house in
Wilbur Hall for three of the last four
years. The Kennedys traveled to the

"I did dilute my courses there," the
young history professor said. "They

TOUGH YOUNG PROF — Assoc. History Prof. David M. Kennedy, considered
as one of the best scholars of American history of his age and rank in the
country, lectures to one of his undergrad classes. Kennedy is "so serious that he
won't lecture if anyone is reading a newspaper in class, because one person isn't
paying attention," according to one junior.
"David Kennedy has to be just
about the hardest professor here.
Don't take him unless you want to
work — and learn something," said a
senior recommending history courses
for this quarter.
Assoc. History Prof. David M.
Kennedy "is considered the best
Americanist of his age and rank in the
country," according to a University
biographical sketch.
Among students here, the 32-year
old Kennedy is fast gaining a
reputation as a stimulating, challenging
but extremely demanding professor —
perhaps a little too demanding for
some.
Roughly 15 percent of the students
enrolled fall quarter in Kennedy's
History 170 flunked the first exam.
The take-home final was "so hard that
when he finished lecturing, I don't
think everyone was sure whether to
applaud or to cuss him out," a
sophomore coed said.
'Eschatologically Vicious'
Kennedy is aware of the
consternation. "The evaluation sheets
in my 170 course were
eschatologically vicious. One guy
wrote on the top of his paper in
capital letters 'YOU ARE REALLY
AN ASSHOLE!,' but the guy went on
to say he liked the course."
This type of personal criticism
bothers Kennedy because "it becomes
obvious that a lot of people see me in
a very different way than I see
myself," he said.
"I don't get upset over comments
that my courses are too difficult or
that people feel they have worked too
hard. Those don't bother me in the
least. In fact, they make me kind of
happy.
"The thing that I find devastating is
the opposite — the students who find
it insufficiently challenging,
insufficiently provocative, and the
ones who really aren't made to work,"
he said.
"It makes me much happier to have
people say of me that they worked
their asses off and learned something,
rather than 'you're a good guy.' "
'Easy To Be Loved'
"It's easy though," he remarked. "I
think it's relatively easy to be loved. I
think it's a terribly seductive thing for
a teacher to do all sorts of corrupt
little things to ingratiate himself with
his students."
Kennedy has angered students by
giving poor grades to large segments of
his classes on examinations. "I don't
see why he should fail so many of
them when other professors give them
As or Bs for the same work. It's just
not fair," said one student.
Kennedy said his reputation for
failing students is greatly exaggerated.
Very few students actually fail his
courses, and he usually discards poor

grades on midterms in favor ol the
term paper and final exam grades.
Only five of 131 students flunked
History 170 last quarter.
"What I'm doing is not making a
judgment about dumbness or
smartness, but about performance in a
given area.
Takes Work Seriously
"There are people here who take
some things less seriously that
others... I take my teaching
seriously; I take American history
seriously and I think that's why I'm
here."
Kennedy graduated from Stanford
in history with honors in 1963. The
Seattle native then traveled east to
Yale University and earned his M.A. in
1964 and his Ph.D. in 1968.
Stanford History Prof. Wayne
Vucinich, from whom Kennedy took
courses as an undergraduate, described
his junior colleague as "a very
promising student. He was very
dedicated to his studies, a fast learner.
He devoured the course material; there
was never enough to satisfy him. He
could manage any assignment you gave
him."
Kennedy received job offers from
both Stanford and Yale. He accepted a
position here as acting assistant
professor of history in 1967 and
became an assistant professor in 1968.
He rose to associate professor last
year.
National Acclaim
His first book, Birth Control in
America: The Career of Margaret
Sanger, was published in 1971. The
work brought him instant national
acclaim and two prizes: the prestigious
Bancroft Prize, awarded by Columbia
University, and the John Gilmary Shea
award from the American Catholic
Historical Association.
History Department Chairman
Gordon Craig described Kennedy as "a
shrewd historian" and "one of the
stars of our department in the way
which he has attracted students, not
by tricks of showmanship, but through
well-organized, deliberately-structured
lectures. He is an exciting teacher."
Students are quick to agree.
"He's the best lecturer I've ever
had," said one student echoing the
opinion of many. "He spends a lot of
time working on his lectures."
Kennedy's reputation as an
excellent lecturer and a tough grader
precedes him, and he finds students'
expectations invigorating. "It's all very
flattering. I'm not unaware of it,"he
grinned.
"I like being expected to do a good
job or a very good job all the time and,
reciprocally, I expect the same thing
of students."
Fence Straddling
Another aspect of Kennedy's
teaching that seems to bother students
is what they view as his "fence

straddling in class," a hesitancy to
commit himself in the "hot" political
and scholarly arguments in history.
"It's odd," said one senior history
major, "because he's a left liberal, but
he seems to be scared of getting an
image as a leftist historian."
Kennedy said his positions in the
classroom are deliberately vague to
avoid "indoctrinating" his students.
He wants to present students with
many different interpretations and let
them "sift out for themselves exactly
what is the proper one."
Kennedy's main complaint with
University life is his lack of time for
writing. "I realize now in a way I never
did when I was a student how people
who really give themselves to their
students have their lives eaten up by
students.
Professors' Defenses
"Often times what students mistake
for coldness and aloofness by
professors are really defenses. The
sheer number of students can gobble
all the working hours of your day up,"
he pointed out.
Yet Kennedy does not isolate
himself from the University and his
students. For the past six years he has
served on the committee in charge of
