# Canonize Or Convict
## Impeachment Drive Caught At Crossroad 
### 
Andrew Leuchter

William Saxbe once compared President Nixon's
version of the Watergate scandal to the testimony of
"the piano player in the whore house who claims he
doesn't know what's going on upstairs." Saxbe's
salty comment represents a disbelief shared by the
majority of Americans: 70 percent of the American
people now think that the President is guilty of at
least one serious crime.
It would seem that Mr. Nixon's sagging
credibility has at last coalesced the sentiment
necessary for his impeachment. But such is not the
case. Indeed, the same polls which gauge the total
lack of faith in President Nixon show that only 47
percent of the Electorate want him to resign; a
considerably smaller number would have him
impeached.
That the American people can entertain two so
logically inconsistent ideas simultaneously — the
President is a felon, but he should stay in office — is
a textbook case of what psychologists term
"insulation." This reluctance to punish corruption
in public office is not unique to the Nixon case —
such unreasoning insulation also marked the
disposition of the case against Spiro Agnew.
A plethora of news leaks, combined with Mr.
Agnew's flimsy denials and obvious evasions, were
sufficient to convince the public of the former
Vice-President's guilt. Yet neither Prosecutor Henry
Peterson's public boasting ("We've got the evidence.
We've got it cold.") nor Mr. Agnew's well-publicized
plea-bargaining was sufficient to stir impeachment
fervor amongst the electorate — though

impeachment was the only sure route to factfinding.
A plurality judgment for impeachment did not
exist until the Agnew case was already closed:
suddenly, most American's thought that the former
Vice-President had gotten off too easily.
The reluctance of the public to impeach Mr.
Agnew is not surprising; he was, after all, a saint
far longer than he was an alleged sinner. Only a
public admission of guilt was sufficient to wrench
the dimming halo from his head. The same lingering
aura of saintliness which caused recalcitrance in
dealing with Mr. Agnew is causing apparent
benevolence in impeaching Mr. Nixon.
The President was certainly no less of a saint
than the former Vice-President. Less than a year
ago, surveys showed that Americans could not
conceive of a more fit President. And even after the
Watergate follies, Richard Nixon was still among
1973's most admired men.
President Nixon's resignation would complete
the parallel to the Agnew case. Resignation would
be tantamount to a public admission of guilt, and
would unify the public in the belief that even
stronger punishment was warranted.
Resignation is unnecessary, however. In a few
months time, the nation will unite in the realization
that President Nixon has been stretching the truth
further than Rose Mary Woods can stretch her leg;
once this consensus has been affirmed by the
upcoming grand jury action, there will surely be
majority sentiment for impeachment.

But Mr. Nixon's tardiness in resigning has created
a condition which Mr. Agnew's expediency avoided.
The President's popularity has decayed to a point
where a vociferous minority is forcing his
impeachment, just as surely as a plurality would.
But rather than engendering sentiment for
punishment, a minority impeachment drive could
easily antagonize a large portion of unconvinced
Americans.
Rather than constituting proof of guilt,
premature impeachment could constitute proof of
what Gerald Ford has termed "the impeachment
conspiracy." While Richard Nixon is in public office
his image is still malleable, his support still subject
to erosion. "Impeachment Now" would firmly
entrench President Nixon's remaining support, and
rally millions of undecided Americans to his cause.
American politics cannot afford such a deep rift in
the electorate.
The "Impeach Nixon" movement now stands at
a peculiar crossroads: it can either canonize or
convict President Nixon. Immediate action can only
serve to turn his lingering sainthood into permanent
martyrdom. Demanding resignation now, and
moving for impeachment later, would leave time for
the full extent of Mr. Nixon's crimes to become
public, and for the impeachment movement to gain
widespread support.
