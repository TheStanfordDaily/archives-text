# Response To S.C.L.A.S.
## Eliminate Double Standard Against Right 
### 
Martin S. Smith

Regarding recent editorials in the Daily by
Stanford's Concerned Latin American Scholars
concerning the military junta in Chile:
It is apparent from the wording and disposition
of these editorials, specifically the appearing in
the Jan. 17 issue, that S.C.L.A.S. i$ anticipating
and hoping for, if not calling for, the overthrow of
the junta and a return to power by the forces of the
left. S.C.L.A.S. reports of junta brutality and rising
resistance are consistently one-sided. Instances of
anti-junta activity and sentiment are carefully
pointed out. Cases of repression by the junta are
described in detail. The successes of the junta's
economic policies and their popularity among
Chileans are totally ignored.
Also ignored are the disastrous failures of
Allende's economic and governmental policies. His
forced socialism program caused the inflation rate in
Chile to exceed 30 percent annually. Strikes
paralyzed the economy, a vicious black market
developed, and middle class citizens numbering in
the hundreds of thousands held massive protests of
Allende's policies in Santiago.
Allende's government was clearly ripe for
overthrow. S.C.L.A.S. has tried to make the junta's
coming to power look like a totally elitist plot
against an unsuspecting Allende. For some reason,
changes in government to the left receive the
glamorous label of "revolution," while changes to
the right receive the elitist title of a "coup."
Right-Wing Revolution
A revolution has indeed taken place in Chile.
Massive opposition from the moderates and right
wing factions effectively paralyzed the country and
the subsequent revolution was unusual in it's rapid
success and smoothness. It had considerable popular
support from the Chilean people.
Allende, though elected, had violated the Chilean
constitution repeatedly, doing nothing about leftist
violence in the streets and illegal seizing of property
by renegade bands. He had rendered Chile's
Parliament virtually impotent. Shortly before his
fall, the opposition majority in Congress passed a
resolution declaring that "the government is not
merely responsible for isolated violations of the law
and the Constitution, it has made them a permanent
system of conduct." It was Allende, then, who
perverted Chile's experiment with democracy. The
blame rests here, not with the junta. The junta was a
primary political force of Chile's enraged right, and
it is natural that it was they who led the revolution.
Repression cannot be condoned or ignored. But
the alternatives to what is going on under the junta
must be considered. S.C.L.A.S. reports of
commando raids, guerilla warfare, and resistance to
the junta carefully exclude use of the word
terrorism. Guerrilla warfare is an inherent

component of terrorism. In October, the junta
uncovered a plan called "Operation Zeta." It called
for the assassination of 17,000 politically and
economically important rightists in Chile. It is
evident, uiat a leftist coalition, including the
Communist party (called the "forces of democracy"
by S.C.L.A.S.) made a conscious decision to use
terrorism as their instrument of resistance against
the junta.
Similar Tactics?
It is not plausible to suggest that leftist forces
employing terrorism would cease this violence if
they were to return to power. They will not make
the same mistake that they accused Allende of
making. His "soft" stance against rightist resisters is
seen by many as the cause of his downfall.
Anti-socialist factions in Chile are too strong to be
ignored.
Chile's professional class (doctors, lawyers,
engineers, etc.), many labor unions, and the Chilean
middle class have proven themselves to be essential
to Chile's economy. Their opposition to socialism
would make them the new targets for repression by
the "forces of democracy" — a
counterrevolutionary leftist government — that
S.C.L.A.S. tells us is welling up in Chile.
The arrest of an estimated 10,000 out of Chile's
millions is an attempt by the junta to prevent the
guerilla warfare and mass assassinations heralded by
the Concerned Scholars. Leftists in Chile have made
their intention to use violence apparent. Right-wing
opposition to Allende took the more peaceful forms
of protests and strikes.
If the leftist terrorists return to power in Chile,
we will be witnessing the beginning of a real
bloodbath, like the 10-20 millions slaughtered in
China following the '49 communist revolution, or
the execution and imprisonment of millions of
Soviets under every dictatorship since the 1918
"liberation." In Latin America, Castro's regime has
been guilty of massive executions. Even now, a
decade after the revolution, tens of thousands flee
from this leftist dictatorship when given the
opportunity.
Leftist Repression
Why doesn't S.C.L.A.S. ever mention these
examples of blatant leftist repression? Why do the
10,000 junta arrests (mild, compared to the cases
above) cause S.C.L.A.S. to write successive editorials
while they totally ignore left wing brutality in Latin
America and the rest of the world? When crying out
against moral injustices, why are they so selective?
This double standard must be pointed out.
S.C.L.A.S. must be seen as a quasi-political left-wing
organization, not as a non-partisan sentinel of

freedom and justice in Latin America. Attempts to
influence readers politically are disguised under
moral, humanitarian pretexts. While condemning
junta brutality and citing it as the cause for
counterrevolution, they passively tolerate, if not
condone, the same tactics when used by leftist
"forces of democracy."
What is Stanford Concerned Latin American
Scholars really concerned about? That in an era
when half the people of the world have fallen under
Communist dictatorships, for once the forces of the
right have triumphed over the forces of the left,
through revolution, in Chile. The main weapon of
the radical left has proven to be usable against the
left.
Constitutional Violations
Allende is not the martyr of democracy. He was
guilty of repeated constitutional violations.
Democracy in Chile died under Salvador Allende.
The junta is in power to prevent Chile's battered
economy from dying also, dying from the reign of
an incompetent president.
Politics is politics. Left and right struggle
continuously in an ideological battle over which
human freedoms are most important. Each side
accuses the other of having the same ultimate
outcome — total tyranny. And each side claims as
its own goal the same ultimate outcome — total
freedom.
The illusion that must be destroyed is that the
left has the market cornered on virtue. It just ain't
so.
