# Cheech & Chong Show Short, Funny
## 
### RONALD BECK 
"They were hilarious, but they
should have done more,"
remarked one member of the
audience. The general reaction to
Cheech and Chong's performance
Friday in Maples Pavilion was
similar.
Having seen it billed as "The
Cheech and Chong Show," many
in the audience were surprised,
and not pleasantly, when another
opening act was announced.
The introduction of Johhny
Barnett, a country-western singer,
met with a large round of boos.
He never did manage to turn the
crowd his way. His songs about
drunks, whores, and addicts only
brought more booing.
The predominantly student
audience made no secret of its
dissatisfaction. Barnett saw the
animosity and quipped, "I feel
like George Wallace at a victory
dinner," which was clever enough
to encourage even more derision.
While leaving the stage, Barnett
left the crowd with one more
vocalization to let his feelings be
known.
Drugs, Sister Mary Elephant
Cheech and Chong came on
after a short intermission. Chong
quickly went into a monologue
about drugs which broke the
crowd up. (After the first act,
though, almost anyone could have
looked great.) Cheech then came
out as Sister Mary Elephant, the
first of many acts that they did
from off of their three albums.
After the monologues, the pair
began to roll off different skits.
Typical of these was an interview
with Harry Palms, three time U.S.

Open Masturbation champ. There
were a multitude of one-line jokes
run off during this skit: "I
understand you were up against
some pretty stiff competition .. .
was it an all-comer's match...
Their next series of skits
centered around Chong as an FM
disc jockey. Almost every act in
this sequence was overly long,
particularly one about a C&W
singer. The skit would have been
good for about three minutes, but
Cheech dragged it on for around

Entertainment

ten.
In another act, Cheech
appeared as a one-armed English
colonel. He had an especially
unique way of holding his
trumpet when he was using his
only hand for gesturing.
Rock Satire
The most memorable act of the
night came when Alice Bowie
(Cheech) came out introduced as
the next rock superstar of the
world. Dressed as a ballerina,
Cheech did a great satire on some

of the more ridiculous rock acts.
Cheech played acid rock guitar
using his toes and his teeth to pick
at the strings. The biggest
applause of the night came when
he pretended to smash the guitar
to the ground.
To finish up the act, Cheech
did a mime of an astronaut
blasting off in time to the theme
from 2001, with a rather bizarre
ending. They left the stage around
50 minutes after they had gotten
on, and they encored about a

minute later.
Their encore was one of their
most famous skits, "Ralph and
Herbie." In it, Cheech and Chong
play two neighborhood dogs who
talk about sex, politics, and crap.
They pretend to participate in
two of the three ideas physically
on stage. This is certainly one of
their cruder acts, but also one of
their funniest. The audience left
smiling, although some were
grumbling about the length of the
set.

BLUES SATIRE — Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong brought
down the house with his characterization of veteran blues singer Blind
Melon Chitlin in the comedy duo's show in Maples Friday night.
"They were hilarious, but they
should have done more,"
remarked one member of the
audience. The general reaction to
Cheech and Chong's performance
Friday in Maples Pavilion was
similar.
Having seen it billed as "The
Cheech and Chong Show," many
in the audience were surprised,
and not pleasantly, when another
opening act was announced.
The introduction of Johhny
Barnett, a country-western singer,
met with a large round of boos.
He never did manage to turn the
crowd his way. His songs about
drunks, whores, and addicts only
brought more booing.
The predominantly student
audience made no secret of its
dissatisfaction. Barnett saw the
animosity and quipped, "I feel
like George Wallace at a victory
dinner," which was clever enough
to encourage even more derision.
While leaving the stage, Barnett
left the crowd with one more
vocalization to let his feelings be
known.
Drugs, Sister Mary Elephant
Cheech and Chong came on
after a short intermission. Chong
quickly went into a monologue
about drugs which broke the
crowd up. (After the first act,
though, almost anyone could have
looked great.) Cheech then came
out as Sister Mary Elephant, the
first of many acts that they did
from off of their three albums.
After the monologues, the pair
began to roll off different skits.
Typical of these was an interview
with Harry Palms, three time U.S.

Open Masturbation champ. There
were a multitude of one-line jokes
run off during this skit: "I
understand you were up against
some pretty stiff competition .. .
was it an all-comer's match...
Their next series of skits
centered around Chong as an FM
disc jockey. Almost every act in
this sequence was overly long,
particularly one about a C&W
singer. The skit would have been
good for about three minutes, but
Cheech dragged it on for around

Entertainment

ten.
In another act, Cheech
appeared as a one-armed English
colonel. He had an especially
unique way of holding his
trumpet when he was using his
only hand for gesturing.
Rock Satire
The most memorable act of the
night came when Alice Bowie
(Cheech) came out introduced as
the next rock superstar of the
world. Dressed as a ballerina,
Cheech did a great satire on some

of the more ridiculous rock acts.
Cheech played acid rock guitar
using his toes and his teeth to pick
at the strings. The biggest
applause of the night came when
he pretended to smash the guitar
to the ground.
To finish up the act, Cheech
did a mime of an astronaut
blasting off in time to the theme
from 2001, with a rather bizarre
ending. They left the stage around
50 minutes after they had gotten
on, and they encored about a

minute later.
Their encore was one of their
most famous skits, "Ralph and
Herbie." In it, Cheech and Chong
play two neighborhood dogs who
talk about sex, politics, and crap.
They pretend to participate in
two of the three ideas physically
on stage. This is certainly one of
their cruder acts, but also one of
their funniest. The audience left
smiling, although some were
grumbling about the length of the
set.
