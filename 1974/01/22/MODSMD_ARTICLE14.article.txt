# Siring Quartet Performance Flawed
## Juilliard Not Up To Par 
### DANIEL V. ROBINSON 
The Julliard String Quartet is a
justly famous chamber music
group, and they played Friday
night in Dinkelspiel to a packed
and enthusiastic house. However,
on this occasion the result was
decidedly disappointing.
The program opened with the
Mozart Quartet in C Major, Op.
465. This exquisite work, often
referred to as the 'Dissonant'
quartet becuase of the strongly
dissonant opening adagio must,
like nearly all of Mozart's works,
be treated with sensitivity and
lightness.
Robert Mann, the first
violinist, played consistently with
a lush, romantic sound, a wide,
slow vibrato, and an uncertain
bow the combination of which
made the pitch uncertain and the
nuance of phrasing inexact. The
other result of Mann's unstylistic
playing was the destruction of the
balance so necessary to a
successful performance of any
classic quartet.
This heavy-handed approach to
the music was most apparent in
the last movement, marked
"Molto Allegro," which was
played as though it were a race.
The only result was that we heard
a great many notes in a short

space of time. It is a movement of
gaiety, theatrical inflection and
humor, all of which were absent
in this performance.
The California premiere of
Elliot Carter's String Quartet No.
3, followed. IT is hard to criticize
the playing of this piece, for I
found the work itself
unintelligible. The quartet was
split into two duos which played
in opposition to each other. There
was much frenzied action, but the
sound of the piece was not
pleasing and its form, in any detail
other than that expressed by the
numerous tempo markings in the
program, was inaudible. Long,
disjointed, apparently formless
works such as this one, composed
mostly of screeches and scratches,
do not seem worth the obvious
difficulty of the performance.
After a welcome intermission
the quartet concluded with the
Debussy Quartet in G Minor. This
piece was much more adroitly
handled than the preceding. The
rapid contrasts were clearly
articulated and the lush sound of
the ensemble well adapted to this
early work of Debussy.
Particularly appealing was the fine
tone and sensitive playing of the
group's cellist, Claus Adam. This
quartet is a beautiful,

"atmospheric" work and the
shifting moods were adequately
captured by the performance.
It was not a concert up to the
standard one is led to expect of a
well known, Eastern performing
organization. Everyone has a bad
night; this was doubtless theirs.

space of time. It is a movement of
gaiety, theatrical inflection and
humor, all of which were absent
in this performance.
The California premiere of
Elliot Carter's String Quartet No.
3, followed. IT is hard to criticize
the playing of this piece, for I
found the work itself
unintelligible. The quartet was
split into two duos which played
in opposition to each other. There
was much frenzied action, but the
sound of the piece was not
pleasing and its form, in any detail
other than that expressed by the
numerous tempo markings in the
program, was inaudible. Long,
disjointed, apparently formless
works such as this one, composed
mostly of screeches and scratches,
do not seem worth the obvious
difficulty of the performance.
After a welcome intermission
the quartet concluded with the
Debussy Quartet in G Minor. This
piece was much more adroitly
handled than the preceding. The
rapid contrasts were clearly
articulated and the lush sound of
the ensemble well adapted to this
early work of Debussy.
Particularly appealing was the fine
tone and sensitive playing of the
group's cellist, Claus Adam. This
quartet is a beautiful,

"atmospheric" work and the
shifting moods were adequately
captured by the performance.
It was not a concert up to the
standard one is led to expect of a
well known, Eastern performing
organization. Everyone has a bad
night; this was doubtless theirs.
The Julliard String Quartet is a
justly famous chamber music
group, and they played Friday
night in Dinkelspiel to a packed
and enthusiastic house. However,
on this occasion the result was
decidedly disappointing.
The program opened with the
Mozart Quartet in C Major, Op.
465. This exquisite work, often
referred to as the 'Dissonant'
quartet becuase of the strongly
dissonant opening adagio must,
like nearly all of Mozart's works,
be treated with sensitivity and
lightness.
Robert Mann, the first
violinist, played consistently with
a lush, romantic sound, a wide,
slow vibrato, and an uncertain
bow the combination of which
made the pitch uncertain and the
nuance of phrasing inexact. The
other result of Mann's unstylistic
playing was the destruction of the
balance so necessary to a
successful performance of any
classic quartet.
This heavy-handed approach to
the music was most apparent in
the last movement, marked
"Molto Allegro," which was
played as though it were a race.
The only result was that we heard
a great many notes in a short

space of time. It is a movement of
gaiety, theatrical inflection and
humor, all of which were absent
in this performance.
