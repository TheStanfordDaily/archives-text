# Cagers Lose Again
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball losing
streak was stretched to six last
night when the Cards dropped a
75-58 decision to Air Force in
Colorado Springs.
The Cards, who have now lost
eight of their last nine games,
trailed throughout the contest.
They pulled within one point at
35-34 after scoring eight straight
points at the start of the second
half, but the Cadets controlled the
game from that point on.
Air Force scored only one
more field goal than Stanford but
converted 23 free throws,
compared to only eight for the
Cards. One possible reason for
those totals was that the regular
referees were snowbound and
never reached the game. Air Force
then recruited what team manager
Mark Florant called "a couple of
Little League local-yokuls," who
whistled 24 fouls on Stanford and
13 on Air Force.
The only highlight for the
Cards, whose record fell to 5-9,
was a superb effort by Rich
Kelley. Kelley hit 11-17 field
goals and 3-3 free throws in a
25-point performance and also
grabbed 19 rebounds.
