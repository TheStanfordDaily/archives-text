# Fall Quarter 1973 Report of the University Ombudsman
## 
### 
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

This number compares with 125 between October
and May 1970-71; a total of 201 between September
and May 1971-72; and 126 between September and
December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.
Harvey Hall
Ombudsman
Sara Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

This number compares with 125 between October
and May 1970-71; a total of 201 between September
and May 1971-72; and 126 between September and
December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office

In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept

Informality continues to be a key in the style of the

phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.
Harvey Hall
Ombudsman
Sara Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Ombudsman
Sara Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

This number compares with 125 between October
and May 1970-71; a total of 201 between September
and May 1971-72; and 126 between September and
December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.
Harvey Hall
Ombudsman
Sara Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

This number compares with 125 between October
and May 1970-71; a total of 201 between September
and May 1971-72; and 126 between September and
December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

This number compares with 125 between October

December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Ombudsman
Sara Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

This number compares with 125 between October
and May 1970-71; a total of 201 between September
and May 1971-72; and 126 between September and
December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.
Harvey Hall
Ombudsman
Sara Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Sara Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

This number compares with 125 between October
and May 1970-71; a total of 201 between September
and May 1971-72; and 126 between September and
December 1972.
More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
As was our practice last year, this quarterly report is
submitted to the University community to give an idea
>112 the situations, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions
that are brought to the office of the University Ombuds
man by members of this community.
The Ombudsman's Office moved to a new location in
Building 80, Room 85, on Inner Quad, but the tele
phone remains the same, ext. 3682. The office continues
o be staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and by an
jmbudsman who is less than 100'/ at this job but who is
mailable at all times when school is in session.
Sara Stephenson, secretary-assistant, is in the office
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. A long-time member of the
campus community, she is very effective and helpful in
many situations, particularly matters of referral and
inquiry. The Ombudsman is frequently elsewhere on the
campus following through on previous matters, but can
always be reached through her.
Conduct of the Office
1. Confidentiality
In accordance with the charge developed by the Com
nittee of Fifteen, the Ombudsman has considered confi-
Jentiality to be of preeminent importance in the con
juct of the office. The identity of complainants is kept
;onfidential unless the Ombudsman is specifically
luthorized to use the name. In most matters it is impor
:ant to identify the individual concerned because not
nany cases can be dealt with categorically. Explicit
aermission to use the name is always obtained first,
lowever.
2. Informality
Informality continues to be a key in the style of the
present Ombudsman. People may write, telephone, tele
phone for appointments, or just drop in. The latter is a
little hazardous, because the Ombudsman is frequently
out of the office pursuing previous matters. For those
who do choose to drop in, the secretary-assistant can
furnish on-the-spot help or can make an appointment tor
the Ombudsman at a later time.
No forms are required, but the Ombudsman or the
;ecretary-assistant will take notes on the matter tor
follow-through purposes and some basic information to
enable us to get in touch with the individual at a later
time and to enable us to classify the matter lor statistical
purposes. The informality does not extend to accepting
anonymous complaints. We are reluctant to accept
third-party complaints—a complaint lodged on behalt of
a roommate, or something of that sort.
3. Independence
The Ombudsman in this community has been
permitted to operate with complete independence. No
■>erson, president of the University or department head,
las tried to intimidate or influence in any nefarious way
he work of the Ombudsman. In all but a couple of cases
\ request for an interview or that a phone call be
returned has received a prompt response. Of course this
s vitally important if the office is to have any credibility
because one of the things that an ombudsman is
supposed to be able to do is to expedite a matter
because of a jurisdictional or other problem in the
Dureaucracy.
4. Diversity of Concerns and Limitations
With just two exceptions, the Ombudsman under
takes al least a preliminary consideration of all matters
that are brought to him by members of the Stanford
community.
In some matters the Ombudsman may function mere
ly as a referral agent. An individual may not know where
to go or how to arrange an appointment with the appro
priate officer—someone who can review an administra
tive decision. Even in these matters, the Ombudsman
will ordinarily undertake to help arrange an appointment
for the person concerned and perhaps furnish some
background information to the administrator involved.
The two categories excepted are legal matters or
those involving the staff in the University grievance
procedures.
A clearly legal matter goes beyond the competence of
the Ombudsman. Both last year and this the Ombuds
man has on occasion referred individuals to any of the
various University attorneys for advice, or alternatively
lie has discussed matters in a preliminary way with one
of the attorneys in the office of the Vice-President for
Business and Finance or in the General Secretary's
Office or on the president's staff. All have been uniform
ly helpful.
Then, of course, this year the ASSIJ is sponsoring a
legal counseling service. In matters such as landlord
tenant disputes and consumer complaints, this new
office is particularly helpful. This service, of course, is
limited to students, and by its charter may not become
involved in matters where a student's adversary is the
University. Early this fall the Ombudsman and Glen
Schofteld. a legal assistance officer, met and arranged to
work cooperatively on behalf of students by reciprocal
referrals.
The other limitation which the Ombudsman has im
posed on himself has to do with a staff problem which is
in the University's formal grievance procedure. It does
not seem appropriate for the Ombudsman to tinker with
a matter which has already been formally "grieved." Of
course there may be some matters which an ombudsman
can deal with assisting an individual who has entered a
formal grievance procedure with something that is pe
ripheral to the substance of the grievance itself. This has
happened on two or three occasions.

5. Procedures
As mentioned earlier it is the practice of the incum
bent Ombudsman to make at least a preliminary investi
gation in any matter except those falling into either of
the two categories mentioned above.
First, the Ombudsman or the assistant to the Om
budsman will take care of referral matters by making
telephone calls just to be sure that we don't give the
individual concerned a "bum steer." (He may come to
the Ombudsman, frustrated, having had enough of those
already.)
On occasion someone may come to the Ombudsman's
Office expecting direct action, but the Ombudsman may
find, after some questions, that there is an appropriate
administrative review which the complainant either did
not know about or had not chosen to use. This then
becomes a secondary kind of referral case in which the
Ombudsman arranges for assistance by the appropriate
person or committee in the University hierarchy.
In other matters the Ombudsman may involve himself
as a kind of factfinder or a mediator. Sometimes this can
be done by telephone, sometimes by writing letters, but
usually this Ombudsman prefers to go to the office of
the individual involved and talk about the problem.
Following this the Ombudsman will inform the com
plainant of the outcome of the matter, either in person j
or in writing. We do try to follow through on the
matters which are brought to us. Sometimes, however, -
after preliminary advice and consultation, the matter is
left in the hands of the individual who brings the prob- }
lem and, unfortunately, he does not always let us know
how the matter turns out.
Statistical Section, Fall of 1973
This report covers the period from September 1973
until the end of fall quarter.
During this period 102 matters were recorded. The
classification system used is necessarily arbitrary but
hopefully consistent.
If several people come in regarding the same matter
this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if one or
more persons bring in several matters at the same time
which are related and subject to the same kind of subject
classification, this will be regarded as one matter.
If two matters are brought in at the same time that
are totally different, for instance, one an academic
matter and another having to do with traffic, these will
be regarded as separate. If the same individual brings in a
separate matter at a later time, this will be regarded as a
new matter for classification purposes.

More staff members used the office this fall, but
fewer in all other categories—particularly there were
fewer graduate students who used the office. There were
exactly the same number of academic matters and
exactly the same number having to do with housing,
more personnel matters, but many fewer in the financial
category.
It does not seem very fruitful to speculate on why"
there were fewer matters brought to the Ombudsman 1
this fall than last fall. Hopefully there are more internal
review mechanisms at all levels of the University hier
archy and that these are better known and better used
by members of the University community, particularly
by students.
Often the best thing the Ombudsman can do is to
assist an individual to get a review by the appropriate
person in the University's chain of command: sometimes
by interceding with that person, sometimes by reporting
the facts to him and sending the complainant to him.
Some Vignettes
Fall and winter 1972-73 quarterly reports of the
Ombudsman contained some case summaries, called
"Vignettes," designed to give members of the University
community some idea of the diversity of matters which
are brought to the Ombudsman. A few of these are
included here for the same reason. In all cases individual
identities are not revealed. Some of the circumstances
may be fictionalized a little to preserve confidentiality,
but basically the situations are real.
The Ombudsman did have some peripheral involve
ment in two of the more or less major issues in the

University this fall—first in the matter of the location of
the office of the Chicano Interim Executive Committee
and second in the matter of closing of student residences
over the period of the Christmas recess.
In the main, however, the Ombudsman's time was
taken with many little personal matters which are not at
all important in the life of the University but which may
be very important in the lives of the people who have
the problems.
No. 5 Mr. X came to the Ombudsman's office to express
his feeling that maybe something could be done to
improve the system of obtaining home addresses of
foreign students who attend Stanford.
As an RA last summer he wanted to write to the
foreign students who were to live in his dorm this year.
He went to the Old Union Information Desk, the person
there referred him to Room No. 137, where someone
else referred him to Freshman Admissions. At Freshman
Admissions he was told the information had been given
to the Registrar and he was told to go back to Room
137, where he was told he might find the addresses at
the I Center. By this time Mr. X was feeling quite
frustrated, he thought the 1 Center would not have an
official list, so he gave up his search.
Mr. X said that the Student Directory lists only the
country in which the student lives because the computer
is not prepared to handle the lengthy foreign addresses.
He suggested that somewhere in the directory there
might be a note saying that home addresses for foreign
students can be obtained from a specific office.
Follow up: The Ombudsman's office checked with
the 1 Center and found that in fact the I Center does
keep names and addresses of all foreign students in a
card index and these addresses are available. The Om
budsman wrote to the Registrar asking that an entry be
made in the Student Directory stating that foreign stu
dent home addresses can be found at the I Center. The
Registrar replied by assuring us that such a notation will
be printed in next year's directory. (It was too late to
include the notation in this year's directory.)
No. 15 The mother of a student, Mr. Y, whose home is
in lowa, wrote to the Ombudsman early last fall asking
for help in finding out what happened to her son's
graduation pictures.
She had written to the photographer in early summer
but had not received a reply. She had asked the photo
grapher to either refund her money or send the pictures.
Several months had gone by and she had not heard from
him.
Follow up: We called the photographer, who made
excuses for the delay, but promised to send the pictures
to the graduate's tamily immediately. The photographer
wrote to the Ombudsman assuring us that the pictures
were mailed Sept. 4. We wrote to the student's family to
let them know what had been done.
No. 75 Ms. A told the Ombudsman that it was very
important for her to have a physiology class with lab
she needs the class for nursing school.
The class was to be given this winter, but now there
seems to be some doubt. Ms. A said that she is staying
over specifically for this course winter quarter. If it is
not given winter but is to be given spring, she'll probably
drop out of school and take it during spring as a gradu
ate at large. The Undergraduate Studies Office has been
attempting to establish such a class as an undergraduate
special.
Follow up: The Ombudsman talked to an assistant
dean in the Undergraduate Studies Office, who said that
establishing the class was uncertain at the moment.
While the Ombudsman was at the Undergraduate Studies
Office, the dean called a doctor in the Physiology De
partment who is trying to arrange for the course with
the assistance of some postdoctoral fellows.
The Physiology Department professor said he would
be willing to offer the class this winter as a nonlab
course, but that would not serve the need since the
professional schools require the physiology with lab. The
dean was going to try to arrange with the head of the
department to arrange for the lab component for the
course. It appears the course is in doubt for winter but
almost surely will be given in the spring.
The Ombudsman called Ms. A to tell her of the
results of his conversation with the dean. Ms. A ex
pressed her appreciation for the efforts on her behalf
she really just wanted to be reassured that a genuine
effort was being made to institute the course she needed.
P.S. Just before we submit this report we find that
the course will not be offered winter, but may be
offered this spring. The long-term solution is to offer the
course in the Human Biology Department. Conclusion:
The Undergraduate Studies Office and others have
worked very hard to establish this course, but somehow
this clearly identified need is still unmet.
No. 88 Ms. B wrote a letter to Police Chief Marvin
llerrington with a copy to the Ombudsman stating that
on a certain date there were 15 cars parked horizontally
in the Alvarado Street staff parking area. None of these
cars had Stanford identification stickers.
This did not include 14 workmen's cars parked verti
cally against the fence where the new Law School is
being built. On the following day 15 cars Were parked
horizontally in staff area without Stanford stickers as
well as the usual 14 other cars parked vertically against
the fence.
Follow up: The Ombudsman called Chief Herrington,
who said he had "assigned it out," his men were looking
into the situation, and were to give him a report. A
couple of weeks later we called Ms. B to ask if anything
had been done about the illegally parked cars, and she
reported the problem was solved and thanked us for the
follow-up.

End Quarter Examinations
Several complaints have been received about final
examinations. Most of these have been from students;
two have been from faculty members.
One student asked if there were any regulations con
cerning the assignment of problem sets for final exami
nation week; another student complained that a profes
sor gave students a take-home exam on Wednesday of
the week preceding finals week and asked that it be
handed in on Monday of finals week. The complainant
felt that the exam should not be due until the day the
exam was scheduled.
Other complaints from students had to do with
arbitrary changing of the final examination or undue
rigidity in not permitting a change. A faculty member
felt that regulations concerning final examinations either
do not exist in sufficiently explicit terms or where they
do exist are not followed. He was troubled by the fact
that his students considered him unduly inflexible when
he would not move his final examination to an earlier
time. Pressure was put on him with the claim that other
instructors were doing so.
There always have been some problems related to the
final examination schedule. Conflicts and other prob
lems do arise. Prior to the fall of 1970 there was a
network of regulations which attempted to spell out the
limits of flexibility and the conditions under which
flexibility was appropriate.
The intention, of course, was to maintain equity
among students, orderliness at a time when academic
pressures get highest, and some protection for faculty
members from individual pressures. The regulations were
presumed, too, to afford protection for students from
arbitrary actions by faculty members.
In the winter and spring of 1970 many changes were
made following recommendations by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. The grading system was changed, and
the detailed regulations concerning final examinations
were washed away. The residue was simply this:
"Examinations are part of the process of education at
the same time that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work. Their structure,
content, frequency, and length are to he determined in
accordance with the nature of the course and the materi
al presented in it, subject only to the limitations con
tained herein.
"Great flexibility is available to instructors in the
choice of types of examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay examinations, take-home
examinations, oral examinations, objective examina
tions, papers, projects. Instructors may use any type or
any combination thereof, guided only by the appropri
ateness of the type of examinations for the material
upon which the student is being examined.
"Final in-class written examinations, when they are
given, are governed by the following regulations: L A
three-hour period is reserved during examinations week
for the final examination in each course of more than
two units. This period must be used but not necessarily
in its entirety, if an in-class written examination is given.
2. Examinations in one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the next-to-last week of classes.
"In courses where a written take-home examination is
appropriate, the examination must be announced at least
one week before it is due.
"In courses where term papers or projects are appro
priate and are assigned by the instructor, they should be
assigned well in advance of the due date.
"Students with conflicts in their schedule should
advise their instructors early in the quarter. "
It may be that this essentially laissez-faire attitude
toward final examinations is enough. Certainly all of the
regulations which used to exist are no longer pertinent.
However, the number of complaints received in this
office suggests that the appropriate faculty-student com
mittee, probably the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, should take another look at this prob
lem.
It may well be this complex Stanford setting with
conflicting interests—some students want early planes
home, while others want a maximum amount of time to
prepare for an examination—is not something that can
be left just between an instructor and a student. The
rights of other faculty members and other students may
be impaired if too many little individual "deals" are
made during the finals period. It does seem that the
Ombudsman is receiving a great many problems which
the Registrar used to, but no longer has the authority to,
deal with.
Conclusion
In concluding this report, I can only reemphasize
what I have probably said in perhaps slightly different
ways in previous reports. The late J. Pearce Mitchell,
registrar emeritus and professor of chemistry emeritus,
who contributed so much to the University and to the
Palo Alto community, told me shortly after I became
registrar, "There is no rule that can be used to justify a
known injustice."
The rules around here are mainly for good reasons,
and the people charged with enforcing them are not
villains; sloppiness and lack of enforcement make for
chaos and inequity, but absolute inflexibility may make
for individual injustice.
In order to avoid these hazards we need a basically
sound system, constant reevaluation by faculty, student,
and administrative policy makers, and wisdom and
justice in the day to day administration of policy.
