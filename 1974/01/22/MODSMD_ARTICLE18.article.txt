Energy Crisis k Not Contrived'
WASHINGTON — Oil executives told Congress
yesterday the energy crisis was not contrived by the
petroleum industry but was caused by low
natural-gas prices and environmental concerns.
The executives testified before a Senate
subcommittee investigating the severity of the
energy crisis. The hearing opened with Sen.
Abraham A. Ribicoff, D-Conn., accusing the oil
industry of "cheating the American public."
Ribicoff said major oil companies had
deliberately misled the public about the scope of
the energy crisis to create a panic situation. He said
the result was that "people are so frightened about
tomorrow that every time they pass a gasoline
station they fill up, just like a dog stopping at every
telegraph pole."
Executives of Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Shell,
Standard of California, Amoco and Texaco sat as a
panel to answer, under oath, charges that the oil
shortage was concocted.
Harry Bridges, president of Shell Oil Co., said the
shortage not only is genuine but the worst is yet to
come.
"We are going to have such acute shortages in the
next few months in all products," he said.
Z.D. Bonner, president of Golf Oil Co.-U.S., said
the shortage should have come as no surprise
because the industry has been issuing warnings since
1960.
Bonner denounced the "mistaken notion" that
the crisis was caused by the Arab shutoff of oil to
the United States.
Another myth, he said, is that the United States
is running out of energy resources.
Finch Will Not Seek Office
SACRAMENTO — Former presidential counselor
Robert Finch withdrew yesterday from contention
as a possible Republican candidate for governor or
U.S. senator.
"I will not seek elective office in 1974. This is
based on personal and family reasons as well as my
commitment to the practice of law," Finch said in a
prepared statement released by his Los Angeles law
office.
He said he has no plans to endorse anybody in
any primary election contest, including the
gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races.

When Finch, 48, left the Nixon administration in
1972 he said he intended to re-enter politics in
California, where he served as lieutenant governor
until 1969.
Finch said his decision did not rule out a future
try at elective office.
Finch's decision leaves Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke and
state Controller Houston Floumoy as the only
major GOP candidates to succeed Gov. Ronald
Reagan. It leaves the field for the GOP Senate
nomination to state Secretary of Health and Welfare
Earl Brian and state Sen. H.L. Richardson.
U.S. Refuses Request For Aid
SAIGON — Official Saigon sources said yesterday
that the United States turned down two requests for
aid in a rescue effort for South Vietnamese military
personnel missing in Saigon's naval battle with
China over the Paracel Islands.
The sources added, however, that U.S. planes
flew reconnaissance missions over the area.
In Washington, a spokesman for the Defense
Department said there were no requests for help and
denied that reconnaissance flights were provided.
The Saigon sources also said an American civilian
is missing on one of the islands that were overrun by
Chinese forces Sunday.
The American was not immediately identified
but was said to be a former U.S. Marine officer who
handled liaison between the U.S. consultate in Da
Nang and the South Vietnamese navy.
South Vietnam conceded military victory this
weekend to China in the dispute over the islands
and is now seeking an emergency meeting of the
United Nations Security Council to present its case
on a diplomatic level.
Former Nixon Aid Charged
WASHINGTON — Herbert L. Porter, the former
Nixon re-election committee official who admitted
lying under oath to remain "a team player," was
charged yesterday with making false statements to
the FBI.
The charge carries a maximum penalty of five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Porter, 35, had been prepared to plead guilty, his
lawyer said, but the judge assigned to the case was
ill and the case was put off, perhaps for a week.
The slender, boyish-looking Porter, told the
Senate Watergate committee last June that he lied

to the FBI, to the grand jury and at the Watergate
trial about money he gave to G. Gordon Liddy, the
alleged mastermind of the Watergate break-in.
He said he agreed to the lie "because of the fear
of group pressure that would ensue, of not being a
team player."
Porter, who had charge of scheduling, is the third
official of President Nixon's re-election committee
to be charged in connection with covering up the
break-in.
Scott Sees Oil Embargo Easing
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican
Leader Hugh Scott said yesterday the largest
obstacle to an end of the Arab oil embargo has been
removed with the signing of the Israeli-Egyptian
disengagement agreement.
After attending a 90-minute briefing by
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, along with
other Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders, Scott said the agreement was a hopeful sign
that "constructive progress" has been made.
However, he would not predict when the Arabs
might resume oil shipments to the United States.
The exports were cut off to protest U.S. policy
toward Israel.
Meanwhile, Kuwait said speculation that the
embargo might be relaxed was "premature."
"Lifting of all oil measures is still linked to Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and the
restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian
people," Kuwait Foreign Minister Sabah el-Ahmed
said in an interview in the Beirut, Lebanon
newspaper A 1 Rai al-Aam — public opinion.
Scott of Pennsylvania and Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., told reporters after the
Kissinger briefing that there were "no secret
agreements" and that the United States acted in the
Middle East solely as a go-between.
Kissinger briefed the President and then 16
congressional leaders from both parties within hours
after his pre-dawn return from an 11-day,
15,600-mile diplomatic mission in the Middle East.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows tonight in the mid

Finch Will Not Seek Office
SACRAMENTO — Former presidential counselor
Robert Finch withdrew yesterday from contention
as a possible Republican candidate for governor or
U.S. senator.
"I will not seek elective office in 1974. This is
based on personal and family reasons as well as my
commitment to the practice of law," Finch said in a
prepared statement released by his Los Angeles law
office.
He said he has no plans to endorse anybody in
any primary election contest, including the
gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races.

When Finch, 48, left the Nixon administration in
1972 he said he intended to re-enter politics in
California, where he served as lieutenant governor
until 1969.
Finch said his decision did not rule out a future
try at elective office.
Finch's decision leaves Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke and
state Controller Houston Floumoy as the only
major GOP candidates to succeed Gov. Ronald
Reagan. It leaves the field for the GOP Senate
nomination to state Secretary of Health and Welfare
Earl Brian and state Sen. H.L. Richardson.
U.S. Refuses Request For Aid
SAIGON — Official Saigon sources said yesterday
that the United States turned down two requests for
aid in a rescue effort for South Vietnamese military
personnel missing in Saigon's naval battle with
China over the Paracel Islands.
The sources added, however, that U.S. planes
flew reconnaissance missions over the area.
In Washington, a spokesman for the Defense
Department said there were no requests for help and
denied that reconnaissance flights were provided.
The Saigon sources also said an American civilian
is missing on one of the islands that were overrun by
Chinese forces Sunday.
The American was not immediately identified
but was said to be a former U.S. Marine officer who
handled liaison between the U.S. consultate in Da
Nang and the South Vietnamese navy.
South Vietnam conceded military victory this
weekend to China in the dispute over the islands
and is now seeking an emergency meeting of the
United Nations Security Council to present its case
on a diplomatic level.
Former Nixon Aid Charged
WASHINGTON — Herbert L. Porter, the former
Nixon re-election committee official who admitted
lying under oath to remain "a team player," was
charged yesterday with making false statements to
the FBI.
The charge carries a maximum penalty of five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Porter, 35, had been prepared to plead guilty, his
lawyer said, but the judge assigned to the case was
ill and the case was put off, perhaps for a week.
The slender, boyish-looking Porter, told the
Senate Watergate committee last June that he lied

to the FBI, to the grand jury and at the Watergate
trial about money he gave to G. Gordon Liddy, the
alleged mastermind of the Watergate break-in.
He said he agreed to the lie "because of the fear
of group pressure that would ensue, of not being a
team player."
Porter, who had charge of scheduling, is the third
official of President Nixon's re-election committee
to be charged in connection with covering up the
break-in.
Scott Sees Oil Embargo Easing
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican
Leader Hugh Scott said yesterday the largest
obstacle to an end of the Arab oil embargo has been
removed with the signing of the Israeli-Egyptian
disengagement agreement.
After attending a 90-minute briefing by
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, along with
other Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders, Scott said the agreement was a hopeful sign
that "constructive progress" has been made.
However, he would not predict when the Arabs
might resume oil shipments to the United States.
The exports were cut off to protest U.S. policy
toward Israel.
Meanwhile, Kuwait said speculation that the
embargo might be relaxed was "premature."
"Lifting of all oil measures is still linked to Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and the
restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian
people," Kuwait Foreign Minister Sabah el-Ahmed
said in an interview in the Beirut, Lebanon
newspaper A 1 Rai al-Aam — public opinion.
Scott of Pennsylvania and Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., told reporters after the
Kissinger briefing that there were "no secret
agreements" and that the United States acted in the
Middle East solely as a go-between.
Kissinger briefed the President and then 16
congressional leaders from both parties within hours
after his pre-dawn return from an 11-day,
15,600-mile diplomatic mission in the Middle East.
Today's Weather

upper 50s and tomorrow in upper 50s to mid 60s.
Energy Crisis k Not Contrived'
WASHINGTON — Oil executives told Congress
yesterday the energy crisis was not contrived by the
petroleum industry but was caused by low
natural-gas prices and environmental concerns.
The executives testified before a Senate
subcommittee investigating the severity of the
energy crisis. The hearing opened with Sen.
Abraham A. Ribicoff, D-Conn., accusing the oil
industry of "cheating the American public."
Ribicoff said major oil companies had
deliberately misled the public about the scope of
the energy crisis to create a panic situation. He said
the result was that "people are so frightened about
tomorrow that every time they pass a gasoline
station they fill up, just like a dog stopping at every
telegraph pole."
Executives of Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Shell,
Standard of California, Amoco and Texaco sat as a
panel to answer, under oath, charges that the oil
shortage was concocted.
Harry Bridges, president of Shell Oil Co., said the
shortage not only is genuine but the worst is yet to
come.
"We are going to have such acute shortages in the
next few months in all products," he said.
Z.D. Bonner, president of Golf Oil Co.-U.S., said
the shortage should have come as no surprise

U.S. Refuses Request For Aid
SAIGON — Official Saigon sources said yesterday
that the United States turned down two requests for
aid in a rescue effort for South Vietnamese military
personnel missing in Saigon's naval battle with
China over the Paracel Islands.
The sources added, however, that U.S. planes
flew reconnaissance missions over the area.
In Washington, a spokesman for the Defense
Department said there were no requests for help and
denied that reconnaissance flights were provided.
The Saigon sources also said an American civilian
is missing on one of the islands that were overrun by
Chinese forces Sunday.
The American was not immediately identified
but was said to be a former U.S. Marine officer who
handled liaison between the U.S. consultate in Da
Nang and the South Vietnamese navy.
South Vietnam conceded military victory this
weekend to China in the dispute over the islands
and is now seeking an emergency meeting of the
United Nations Security Council to present its case
on a diplomatic level.
Former Nixon Aid Charged
WASHINGTON — Herbert L. Porter, the former
Nixon re-election committee official who admitted
lying under oath to remain "a team player," was
charged yesterday with making false statements to
the FBI.
The charge carries a maximum penalty of five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Porter, 35, had been prepared to plead guilty, his
lawyer said, but the judge assigned to the case was
ill and the case was put off, perhaps for a week.
The slender, boyish-looking Porter, told the
Senate Watergate committee last June that he lied

to the FBI, to the grand jury and at the Watergate
trial about money he gave to G. Gordon Liddy, the
alleged mastermind of the Watergate break-in.
He said he agreed to the lie "because of the fear
of group pressure that would ensue, of not being a
team player."
Porter, who had charge of scheduling, is the third
official of President Nixon's re-election committee
to be charged in connection with covering up the
break-in.
Scott Sees Oil Embargo Easing
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican
Leader Hugh Scott said yesterday the largest
obstacle to an end of the Arab oil embargo has been
removed with the signing of the Israeli-Egyptian
disengagement agreement.
After attending a 90-minute briefing by
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, along with
other Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders, Scott said the agreement was a hopeful sign
that "constructive progress" has been made.
However, he would not predict when the Arabs
might resume oil shipments to the United States.
The exports were cut off to protest U.S. policy
toward Israel.
Meanwhile, Kuwait said speculation that the
embargo might be relaxed was "premature."
"Lifting of all oil measures is still linked to Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and the
restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian
people," Kuwait Foreign Minister Sabah el-Ahmed
said in an interview in the Beirut, Lebanon
newspaper A 1 Rai al-Aam — public opinion.
Scott of Pennsylvania and Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., told reporters after the
Kissinger briefing that there were "no secret
agreements" and that the United States acted in the
Middle East solely as a go-between.
Kissinger briefed the President and then 16
congressional leaders from both parties within hours
after his pre-dawn return from an 11-day,
15,600-mile diplomatic mission in the Middle East.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows tonight in the mid
30s to lower 40s with local early morning frost.
Slightly warmer days with highs today in the mid to
upper 50s and tomorrow in upper 50s to mid 60s.
Energy Crisis k Not Contrived'
WASHINGTON — Oil executives told Congress
yesterday the energy crisis was not contrived by the
petroleum industry but was caused by low
natural-gas prices and environmental concerns.
The executives testified before a Senate
subcommittee investigating the severity of the
energy crisis. The hearing opened with Sen.
Abraham A. Ribicoff, D-Conn., accusing the oil
industry of "cheating the American public."
Ribicoff said major oil companies had
deliberately misled the public about the scope of
the energy crisis to create a panic situation. He said
the result was that "people are so frightened about
tomorrow that every time they pass a gasoline
station they fill up, just like a dog stopping at every
telegraph pole."
Executives of Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Shell,
Standard of California, Amoco and Texaco sat as a
panel to answer, under oath, charges that the oil
shortage was concocted.
Harry Bridges, president of Shell Oil Co., said the
shortage not only is genuine but the worst is yet to
come.
"We are going to have such acute shortages in the
next few months in all products," he said.
Z.D. Bonner, president of Golf Oil Co.-U.S., said
the shortage should have come as no surprise
because the industry has been issuing warnings since
1960.
Bonner denounced the "mistaken notion" that
the crisis was caused by the Arab shutoff of oil to
the United States.
Another myth, he said, is that the United States
is running out of energy resources.
Finch Will Not Seek Office
SACRAMENTO — Former presidential counselor
Robert Finch withdrew yesterday from contention
as a possible Republican candidate for governor or
U.S. senator.
"I will not seek elective office in 1974. This is
based on personal and family reasons as well as my
commitment to the practice of law," Finch said in a
prepared statement released by his Los Angeles law
office.
He said he has no plans to endorse anybody in
any primary election contest, including the
gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races.

When Finch, 48, left the Nixon administration in
1972 he said he intended to re-enter politics in
California, where he served as lieutenant governor
until 1969.
Finch said his decision did not rule out a future
try at elective office.
Finch's decision leaves Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke and
state Controller Houston Floumoy as the only
major GOP candidates to succeed Gov. Ronald
