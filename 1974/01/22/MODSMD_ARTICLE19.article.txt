# Summer Quarter 1973 Report of the University Ombudsman
## 
### 
Following are comments by John Black of the Dean
of Student Affairs Office, who served as Ombudsman
during summer quarter and continued as acting Ombuds
man until the return of Harvey Hall to this position Oct
15:
While the specific problems that bring people to the
Ombudsman are incredibly diverse, there are some re
curring themes that may benefit from examination.
One oft-heard cry of students and employees alike in
recent years calls for "more control over our lives," and
certainly students, at least, have won a degree of self
governance over their personal, social, and academic lives
that was unthinkable a few years ago.
Yet underneath many of the specific complaints that
are brought to the Ombudsman there is often a pro
found sense of frustration generated by the feeling that
one cannot control or manipulate the institutional
machinery that is ostensibly designed to serve one's
needs.
The student, or employee, feels he has a legitimate
request or need which the bureaucracy-and I'm not using
that term pejoratively-either refuses to satisfy or, more
oftan, is simply failing to respond to.
Using an analogy most of us can relate to: they have
been putting into the machinery what they understand
to be the proper coins, pulling what they think are the
right levers, maybe even giving the machine a healthy
kick or two-and still nothing comes out!
This experience may be more frightening to the
young because they have become less inured to it, and
because some of them are fearful of becoming victims of
a monolithic "system" or afraid of the dehumanizing
experience of being unable to control the technology
designed to serve them.
What might be done to reduce the incidence or the
intensity of this frustration at the University? Three
suggestions, none of them novel, occur to me.
1. We need to provide good information about how

to operate the machinery. Where does one go for what
purpose? Office names should reflect their functions as
closely as possible; likely misapprehensions should be
anticipated and corrected. Ambiguities in rules and regu
lations should be clarified wherever possible. Finally,
people need to know where to go or what to do when
the machinery doesn't work the way they think it
should.
One's irritation and feelings of helplessness are exac
erbated by being sent from place to place with a prob
lem. Most often this experience seems to result from a
failure of the receptionist, secretary, faculty member, or
staff officer to listen long enough or carefully enough to
obtain an accurate understanding of the problem in
volved; occasionally it appears due to ignorance about
the machinery on the part of the person giving direc
tions.
Offices dealing with large numbers of students, em
ployees, or the general public should be sufficiently
well-staffed with intelligent receptionists that they can
listen long enough to be certain they understand a prob
lem, or can make a phone call to insure they are sending
a client to the right office.
2. A few months as Ombudsman will convince any
one, I am sure, that however just and appropriate a rule
regulation, or policy statement, there will arise some
time a unique set of circumstances which will require
that an exception be made in the interest of justice or
humanity. It is, therefore, essential that first-line person
nel who are responsible for communicating policies and
regulations to students either (a) be given some discre
tion in making exceptions to some rules in unusual
circumstances, or (b) be instructed to advise dissatisfied
students where they may appeal and, if possible, to assist
them in obtaining audience with the appropriate indivi
dual or committee.
Front-line personnel sometimes become emotionally
invested in the enforcement of rules. When they do,

either we have chosen the wrong persons or we are using
them to shield us from both legitimate and illegitimate
requests.
This protection is achieved by implying that there
exists absolutely no mechanism for making exceptions;
it may even help to convey the notion that, if the
student persists in seeking relief, a worse fate will befall
him. Such treatment is very destructive of good will and
of the feelings we all want to stimulate that the institu
tion really is concerned about the individual and is
flexible enough to accommodate special circumstances
and needs.
3. A third source of frustration with institutional
machinery stems from what the client experiences as
inordinate delay in the making of a decision. While
understandable delays sometimes result from the need
for committee action, or the need for a collaborative
decision by several different officers of the University,
most requests from students or employees do not
require such complex processes for resolution.
Because they may involve only a single client, how
ever. they often receive low priority even though, when
finally confronted, the decision may require only 30
seconds to make. Even a negative decision on a request is
often less irritating to the client than a prolonged inabili
ty to elicit any response at all.
One of the striking experiences of the Ombudsman is
the genuine gratitude and appreciation expressed by
most clients regardless of whether their requests or com
plaints are resolved in their favor. It is as if, having
received an attentive hearing and elicited a firm answer,
their faith in their ability to operate the machinery is
restored!
The institution will hear them and will respond.
Perhaps with a little more awareness of these problems
among us all, the institution's capacity for benign and
humane behavior in responding to the individual can be
made increasingly apparent.

SUMMER QUARTER STATISTICS
Following is a summer quarter statistical report on
activities of the Ombudsman. Cases initiated after Sept.
14 are included in the fall quarter report.
The number of cases handled is slightly understated,
because cases requiring only information-giving were not
recorded if they were disposed of in a single brief visit. It
appears that the summer load is about one-third that of
a regular quarter, but the proportion of the summer
population utilizing the Ombudsman's Office is at least
equal to that during the regular year:
SUMMER QUARTER ACTIVITIES
By Client By Subject
Faculty 3 Academic 4
Students 19 Admissions 5
Undergraduates (10) Discrimination 1
Graduates (9) Financial 5
Staff 7 Food Service 1
Others 10 Health 1
Total 39 Housing 4
Library 2
Parking/Traffic 1
Personnel (job
problems) 6
Pets 1
Miscellaneous 8
Total 39
Office Location
To preserve the identity, integrity, and effectiveness
of the office, I believe the person acting as Ombudsman
during the summer should be housed in and function
from the office assigned to the Ombudsman and should
have ample opportunity to discuss the responsibilites
and procedures of the office with the regular incumbent
of the office.
