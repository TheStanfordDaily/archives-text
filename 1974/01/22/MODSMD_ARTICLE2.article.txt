# Minority Enrollment Stabilizes, Shifts To Professional Schools
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Admissions and enrollments of
black, Chicano and American Indian
graduate students "are beginning to
show evidence of reaching equilibrium
levels," Dean of Graduate Studies
Lincoln Moses reported last week.
Meanwhile, graduate level
enrollment of women rose from 892
last year to 983 this year. In that same
period, total graduate level enrollment
fell from 5768 to 5689, Moses said.
Moses disclosed the figures in his
first affirmative action report to the
Faculty Senate, and has incorporated
them into a report made available last
week.
Shift To Professions
New enrollments by minority
students dropped slightly this fall, and
showed a significant shift from
academic Ph D. programs to the
professional schools of law, business,
and medicine. Minority enrollments in
Ph.D. and Masters' academic programs
fell from 101 last year to 74 this year,
while they rose from 61 to 78 in the
professional schools.
"If one takes the view that a major
justification for Stanford's Affirmative
Action Program is to increase the
number of well-trained persons ready
to take leadership roles in society,"
Moses wrote, "then increasing the
number of doctors, lawyers, (and]
business executives may have special
justification which applies less directly
and strongly to training for academic
degrees. It would of course be
regrettable to see such a shift go too
far, for the country will need its share
of academicians coming from ethnic
minorities too."
Minority applicants are more likely
to enroll than applicants in general,
but Moses said the differences,
"though consistent, are not large."
Statistics were supplied only for
applicants and enrollees — not
applicants admitted.
In 1972-73, the report shows,
about one of six applicants in the
humanities eventually enrolled,
compared to one of every 12.4
applicants in the entire pool. In the
School of Medicine, one of every 32.7
minority applicants enrolled,
compared to one of every 45.9 among
all applicants. Other differences were
less pronounced.
Moses reported "a startling increase
in the number and percentage of
women receiving graduate degrees"
over the last 20 years.

In 1952-53, only seven women
received Ph.D.s here — 5.3 percent of
the total. In 1971-72, 68 women
received such degrees, or 12.5 percent.
Last year the figures rose to 83 and
15.2 percent.
A wide difference in representation
of women among various disciplines
persists, however. Last year, 45.5
percent of M.A. recipients were
women; 14 percent of J.D. (Law)
recipients; 10.1 percent of M.D.
recipients; and 6.4 percent of M.B.A.
recipients.
Differences are also evident in
enrollment figures for the various
graduate schools.
This fall, the proportion of women
enrolled ranged from 4.2 percent in
the School of Engineering to 18
percent in the Law School, 18.7
percent in M.D. programs, 26.7
percent in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, and 48 percent in the
School of Education.
There appears to be no significant
"advantage" accorded to women in
the admissions process, except in the
Business School (where 11.8 percent

of M.B.A. applicants were women, and
14.4 of admittees last year, were
women) and the School of Medicine
(where 21.8 percent of M.D.
applicants, and 27.7 percent of
admittees, were women).
Contrary to widely-held academic
opinion, recent year-to-year attrition
of women enrolled in humanities and
social science Ph.D. programs is lower
than that of men, Moses said.
"It's a good report," said Anne
Miner, University Affirmative Action
officer. "Of course, it could be better.
But it shows we're down to the point
of fine-tuning. My field is really only
employment, but it's refreshing to
have all these figures made public."
But Asst. German Prof. Ann Snow
cautioned that the problem of
affirmative action for women has not
been solved.
"The interest of the community has
to be kept up," Snow said. "Dean
Moses himself cannot be expected to
keep this up alone. Women will not be
content with having a report; they'll
continue to take an active interest in
the admissions problem."
