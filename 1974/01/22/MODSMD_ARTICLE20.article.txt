# Background and charge of the Committee of 15 to the University Ombudsman
## 
### 
Background
For students, faculty, and staff who are new to Stan
ford (and for those of you who are not new but have not
had occasion to use this office) the following back
ground information might be helpful.
A subcommittee of the Committee of Fifteen in
about 1968 was appointed to explore the possibility of
establishing an office which might help members of the
community to solve problems of whatever kind might
arise in this rather complex place.
The full committee, which is composed of faculty,
representatives of the administration, and students, sub
sequently approved the report and transmitted it to the
Faculty Senate and the President of the University.
Following these approvals, the first Ombudsman was
appointed in l l )69. Dr. Herant Katchadourian served for
a year and a half. His successor, Lois Amsterdam, served
for one year. I followed Ms. Amsterdam and am now in
my second year in this position.
The Committee of Fifteen proposal was very sound
and still serves with very minor changes as a charter for
the Ombudsman.
Because it has been the basic document of the Office
of Ombudsman, that chargc should be known to the
whole community so that potential complainants and
those complained against may know the extent and the
limitations on the Ombudsman's authority.

Following is the charge developed by the Committee
of Fifteen for the Office of the Ombudsman in 1969,
with the exception of a few technical sections having to
do with such matters as selection of the Ombudsman. A
few technical changes made during the past summer have
been incorporated in this text, which has the approval of
the President of the University.
Purpose.The Ombudsman's task is lo protect the inte
rests and rights of members of the Stanford community
from injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross in
efficiency, from unnecessary delay and complication in
administration of University rules and regulations, and
from inconsistency, unfairness, unresponsiveness, and
prejudice in the individual's experience with University
activities. The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine,
and channel the complaints and grievances of members
of the Stanford community and to secure expeditious
and impartial redress.
Purview. The scope of the Ombudsman's concern
comprises all injustices or abuses related to the functions
of the University, whether in the academic life of the
University, in its residences, in its administrative offices,
or in other settings of University life.
Ordinarily the Ombudsman will investigate a griev
ance on the basis of a request brought to him by an
individual. He may, however, act on his own initiative

when he perceives an inconsistency or unfairness in the
life of the University.
Any committee, tribunal, or officer of the University
may refer a case to the Ombudsman for his attention.
Certain councils may develop the practice of routinely
referring certain classes of cases to the Ombudsman for
his attention, knowing that he may return the case to
them for further consideration, or that the complainant
may return to them for action after consultation with
the Ombudsman.
The Ombudsman may refuse to deal with any case
which he considers inappropriate to his office.
Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputa
tion for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful conce-.i
for the welfare of all members of the University commu
nity and for the well-being of the University.
The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues in
quiries into the issues involved, and makes recommenda
tions for suitable action. His investigative powers"include
access, on a confidential basis, to all official University
records. He may request an audience with any member
of the Stanford community, and that person is obliged
to meet with him promptly. His remedial weapons are
persuasion and private or public criticism.
Administrative Arrangements. The office of the
Ombudsman will be financed by the President's Office.
It will be located in a place which symbolizes the
Ombudsman's independence. Its staff will include a full

time secretary for the Ombudsman. The University will
provide the Ombudsman with legal counsel, liability
insurance, and other services as needed. The Ombuds
man will be available at this office at announced hours
when the University is in session. The Ombudsman will
nominate to the President an alternate to serve in his
stead on a temporary basis when he is unavailable or
when he disqualifies himself. The existence and func
tions of the Ombudsman will be announced annually in
various University bulletins and catalogs, and in the
student newspaper.
Method of Operation. When the Ombudsman receives
a complaint which seems to him to merit investigation,
he will ask the appropriate persons for an explanation.
He has the power to enlist technical assistance when
necessary. He may seek consultation with any person. If
necessary, he will consult further with the complainant
and again with those against whom the complaint is
lodged. He will report his findings to those concerned.
He may suggest a specific remedy to correct individual
injustices, and he may suggest an improvement in future
procedures and routines. When he finds that a complain
ant's grievance is unfounded, he will explain that finding
to him. The Ombudsman proceeds expeditiously, with
out formal hearing procedures. He is obliged to respect
confidences and personal privacy. He reports at least
annually to the University community and to the Presi
dent, and it is anticipated that, at the Ombudsman's
discretion, his reports may be brief and general.

University, in its residences, in its administrative offices,
or in other settings of University life.
Ordinarily the Ombudsman will investigate a griev
ance on the basis of a request brought to him by an
individual. He may, however, act on his own initiative

when he perceives an inconsistency or unfairness in the
life of the University.
Any committee, tribunal, or officer of the University
may refer a case to the Ombudsman for his attention.
Certain councils may develop the practice of routinely
referring certain classes of cases to the Ombudsman for
his attention, knowing that he may return the case to
them for further consideration, or that the complainant
may return to them for action after consultation with
the Ombudsman.
The Ombudsman may refuse to deal with any case
which he considers inappropriate to his office.
Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputa
tion for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful conce-.i
for the welfare of all members of the University commu
nity and for the well-being of the University.
The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues in
quiries into the issues involved, and makes recommenda
tions for suitable action. His investigative powers"include
access, on a confidential basis, to all official University
records. He may request an audience with any member
of the Stanford community, and that person is obliged
to meet with him promptly. His remedial weapons are
persuasion and private or public criticism.
Administrative Arrangements. The office of the
Ombudsman will be financed by the President's Office.
It will be located in a place which symbolizes the
Ombudsman's independence. Its staff will include a full

time secretary for the Ombudsman. The University will
provide the Ombudsman with legal counsel, liability
insurance, and other services as needed. The Ombuds
man will be available at this office at announced hours
when the University is in session. The Ombudsman will
nominate to the President an alternate to serve in his
stead on a temporary basis when he is unavailable or
when he disqualifies himself. The existence and func
tions of the Ombudsman will be announced annually in
various University bulletins and catalogs, and in the
student newspaper.
Method of Operation. When the Ombudsman receives
a complaint which seems to him to merit investigation,
he will ask the appropriate persons for an explanation.
He has the power to enlist technical assistance when
necessary. He may seek consultation with any person. If
necessary, he will consult further with the complainant
and again with those against whom the complaint is
lodged. He will report his findings to those concerned.
He may suggest a specific remedy to correct individual
injustices, and he may suggest an improvement in future
procedures and routines. When he finds that a complain
ant's grievance is unfounded, he will explain that finding
to him. The Ombudsman proceeds expeditiously, with
out formal hearing procedures. He is obliged to respect
confidences and personal privacy. He reports at least
annually to the University community and to the Presi
dent, and it is anticipated that, at the Ombudsman's
discretion, his reports may be brief and general.
Background
For students, faculty, and staff who are new to Stan
ford (and for those of you who are not new but have not
had occasion to use this office) the following back
ground information might be helpful.
A subcommittee of the Committee of Fifteen in
about 1968 was appointed to explore the possibility of
establishing an office which might help members of the
community to solve problems of whatever kind might
arise in this rather complex place.
The full committee, which is composed of faculty,
representatives of the administration, and students, sub
sequently approved the report and transmitted it to the
Faculty Senate and the President of the University.
Following these approvals, the first Ombudsman was
appointed in l l )69. Dr. Herant Katchadourian served for
a year and a half. His successor, Lois Amsterdam, served
for one year. I followed Ms. Amsterdam and am now in
my second year in this position.
The Committee of Fifteen proposal was very sound
and still serves with very minor changes as a charter for
the Ombudsman.
Because it has been the basic document of the Office
of Ombudsman, that chargc should be known to the
whole community so that potential complainants and
those complained against may know the extent and the
limitations on the Ombudsman's authority.

Following is the charge developed by the Committee
of Fifteen for the Office of the Ombudsman in 1969,
with the exception of a few technical sections having to
do with such matters as selection of the Ombudsman. A
few technical changes made during the past summer have
been incorporated in this text, which has the approval of
the President of the University.
Purpose.The Ombudsman's task is lo protect the inte
rests and rights of members of the Stanford community
from injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross in
efficiency, from unnecessary delay and complication in
administration of University rules and regulations, and
from inconsistency, unfairness, unresponsiveness, and
prejudice in the individual's experience with University
activities. The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine,
and channel the complaints and grievances of members
of the Stanford community and to secure expeditious
and impartial redress.
Purview. The scope of the Ombudsman's concern
comprises all injustices or abuses related to the functions
of the University, whether in the academic life of the
University, in its residences, in its administrative offices,
or in other settings of University life.

necessary. He may seek consultation with any person. If
necessary, he will consult further with the complainant
and again with those against whom the complaint is
lodged. He will report his findings to those concerned.
He may suggest a specific remedy to correct individual
injustices, and he may suggest an improvement in future
procedures and routines. When he finds that a complain
ant's grievance is unfounded, he will explain that finding
to him. The Ombudsman proceeds expeditiously, with
out formal hearing procedures. He is obliged to respect
confidences and personal privacy. He reports at least
annually to the University community and to the Presi
dent, and it is anticipated that, at the Ombudsman's
discretion, his reports may be brief and general.
Background
For students, faculty, and staff who are new to Stan
ford (and for those of you who are not new but have not
had occasion to use this office) the following back
ground information might be helpful.
A subcommittee of the Committee of Fifteen in
about 1968 was appointed to explore the possibility of
establishing an office which might help members of the
community to solve problems of whatever kind might
arise in this rather complex place.
The full committee, which is composed of faculty,
representatives of the administration, and students, sub
sequently approved the report and transmitted it to the
Faculty Senate and the President of the University.
Following these approvals, the first Ombudsman was
appointed in l l )69. Dr. Herant Katchadourian served for
a year and a half. His successor, Lois Amsterdam, served
for one year. I followed Ms. Amsterdam and am now in
my second year in this position.
The Committee of Fifteen proposal was very sound
and still serves with very minor changes as a charter for
the Ombudsman.
Because it has been the basic document of the Office
of Ombudsman, that chargc should be known to the
whole community so that potential complainants and
those complained against may know the extent and the
limitations on the Ombudsman's authority.

Following is the charge developed by the Committee
of Fifteen for the Office of the Ombudsman in 1969,
with the exception of a few technical sections having to
do with such matters as selection of the Ombudsman. A
few technical changes made during the past summer have
been incorporated in this text, which has the approval of
the President of the University.
Purpose.The Ombudsman's task is lo protect the inte
rests and rights of members of the Stanford community
from injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross in
efficiency, from unnecessary delay and complication in
administration of University rules and regulations, and
from inconsistency, unfairness, unresponsiveness, and
prejudice in the individual's experience with University
activities. The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine,
and channel the complaints and grievances of members
of the Stanford community and to secure expeditious
and impartial redress.
Purview. The scope of the Ombudsman's concern
comprises all injustices or abuses related to the functions
of the University, whether in the academic life of the
University, in its residences, in its administrative offices,
or in other settings of University life.
Ordinarily the Ombudsman will investigate a griev
ance on the basis of a request brought to him by an
individual. He may, however, act on his own initiative

when he perceives an inconsistency or unfairness in the
life of the University.
Any committee, tribunal, or officer of the University
may refer a case to the Ombudsman for his attention.
Certain councils may develop the practice of routinely
referring certain classes of cases to the Ombudsman for
his attention, knowing that he may return the case to
them for further consideration, or that the complainant
may return to them for action after consultation with
the Ombudsman.
The Ombudsman may refuse to deal with any case
which he considers inappropriate to his office.
Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputa
tion for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful conce-.i
for the welfare of all members of the University commu
nity and for the well-being of the University.
The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues in
quiries into the issues involved, and makes recommenda
tions for suitable action. His investigative powers"include
access, on a confidential basis, to all official University
records. He may request an audience with any member
of the Stanford community, and that person is obliged
to meet with him promptly. His remedial weapons are
persuasion and private or public criticism.
Administrative Arrangements. The office of the
Ombudsman will be financed by the President's Office.
It will be located in a place which symbolizes the
Ombudsman's independence. Its staff will include a full

time secretary for the Ombudsman. The University will
provide the Ombudsman with legal counsel, liability
insurance, and other services as needed. The Ombuds
man will be available at this office at announced hours
when the University is in session. The Ombudsman will
nominate to the President an alternate to serve in his
stead on a temporary basis when he is unavailable or
when he disqualifies himself. The existence and func
tions of the Ombudsman will be announced annually in
various University bulletins and catalogs, and in the
student newspaper.
Method of Operation. When the Ombudsman receives
a complaint which seems to him to merit investigation,
he will ask the appropriate persons for an explanation.
He has the power to enlist technical assistance when
necessary. He may seek consultation with any person. If
necessary, he will consult further with the complainant
and again with those against whom the complaint is
lodged. He will report his findings to those concerned.
