# KZSU Staff Squabbles Over Programming
## 
### DON COX Second Of Two Parts 
Behind the election of Francis Dickerson to his
post as KZSU Programming Director and the
installation of the new programming format is a
confusing morass of station politics that often
becomes quite personal.
"Since there is no [financial] incentive to work
at KZSU, there develops a personal committment
and involvement with the station," said one KZSU
staffer. This personal rather than financial link to
the station thus becomes a source of many
personality conflicts.
Disagreements between the two political factions
center around the retention or abolition of the
newly installed format.
The format, as it stands, requires a programmer
to play six cuts from the format list every hour.
This amounts to about 25 minutes of format music
per hour.
New Format
Dickerson believes that the 60 percent vote he
received in the recent station election, before which
he made it clear that he would install a format, is a
mandate to keep the format. "Student listenership
is intolerably low and we must restore confidence in
the station. We're at a turnover stage and even my
critics will say I'm trying to make needed changes."
Dickerson estimated that 60-70 percent of the

programmers were in favor of the format.
The station plans a survey of student opinion
concerning the new format this quarter.
Shoddy Election
Programmers opposing the new setup say that
Dickerson was elected by the News and Public
Affairs personnel and not by a majority of the
programmers. The DJ's advocate election of the
Programming Director by the programmers.
"The election was pretty shoddily handled in
general," said programmer Cory Boyan. "Votes
were counted before the polls closed and a running
tally was kept. The last votes were literally
announced as they were cast," Boyan added.
He also claimed that the pro-format personnel
attempted to purge the opposition prior to the last
election.
Former Station Manager Lloyd Snook agreed
that it wasn't "the best run election I've ever seen"
but insisted that it would have been "a very stupid
political move" to purge any member of the
opposition prior to the election. A few people, who
were opposed to the new format, were fired before
the election, but Snook said they were asked to
leave for "disciplinary purposes."
He saw no need to change the position of
Programming Director to one elected only by the
programmers. "Everybody in the station should
have a say in which way the station is going," said

Snook.
Boyan agreed with Dickerson that the station's
first obligation is to the student body which
supports KZSU financially through the quarterly fee
assessment. But he disagrees on how the station
should meet that responsibility.
"Our obligation is not to any specific cross
section of the student body, but to all of the
student body. We can offer something no other
station in the area offers — free form stereo radio.
We can make all of the people happy some of the
time instead of some of the people all of the time.
"Therefore, the greatest service that KZSU could
provide is to offer as diverse programming as is
possible," Boyan said.
He added, "I can't deny that there is some
self-interest involved, but that is only natural."
Boyan maintained he was most concerned about
the student body. "It's essential that the students
not get hosed over since they pay for the station,"
said Boyan.
Diverse Format
Former Programming Director Mike Windes said
that KZSU is "providing a more diverse program
now with the format." Windes questions whether
much of the music on the format would be played
in a free "progressive" format.
"The format can guarantee some diversity," said
Gary Fazzino, KZSU station manager.
The programmer has a big opportunity
to play what he wants and to get in
the format," Fazzino said.
'There is a point at which we
shouldn't sacrifice certain things for
the sake of professionalism. We're not
going to sacrifice educational
opportunities and specialized
community service to become a CBS
type organization," Fazzino added.
Non-Students Purged?
Other complaints about the station
management center around the status
of non-student programmers. In the
past non-students have stimulated the
growth of progressive free format
radio. During on-campus rioting in
1970, 1972 and 1972, News and
Public Affairs became the number-one
priority in the station. The ranks of
the non-students dwindled and now
some are charging that they are being
purged.
Dickerson insists that
"non-students are welcome and
essential in the operation of the
station" and that he is only "giving
students a fairer break." The increase
in the number of students joining the
staff, has forced most of the
non-students off the air, however,
since there are no longer enough time
slots to go around.
"There is no conscious effort to
purge the non-students, though it
would be naive to think that we didn't
realize what would happen when we
took on more students," said Snook.

"There is a big hassle here with the
non-students," said Boyan.
"Qualifications are sometimes second
to the fact of whether the person is a
student or not." The non-student can
often help and guide the new recruits,
providing a perspective that might
otherwise be lost."
There have . been suggestions
through KZSU's University liaison
man, Assistant to the Dean on Student
Affairs, Dale Snape, to the station to
make sure that students get every
break possible. "I consider the use of
non-students to be an exception and if
indeed such a need it belies the often
quoted cry of being a
'student-operated station,'" reads a
memo to Snook from Snape.
Stabilize Or Murder?
Intense political squabbles and
personality conflicts seem a way of life
around KZSU in general. "It can't get
any more intense without having
murders in the studios," said Snook.
Former News Director Bob Fuss
thought "there is a lot less hassle then
there used to be" in the days when
station disputes centered around the
amount of air time to which the News
and Public Affairs departments were
entitled.
Snook thought that the situation
"would soon stabilize since there are
enough people coming into the station
that like the way we're going."
No one seems certain about the
future.
As for the format, "it may or may
not stay; but I think it will remain
from now on in one state or another,"
said Dickerson.
"It's hard to be conclusive," he
added.

and Public Affairs departments were
entitled.
Snook thought that the situation
"would soon stabilize since there are
enough people coming into the station
that like the way we're going."
No one seems certain about the
future.
As for the format, "it may or may
not stay; but I think it will remain
from now on in one state or another,"
said Dickerson.
"It's hard to be conclusive," he
added.
Behind the election of Francis Dickerson to his
post as KZSU Programming Director and the
installation of the new programming format is a
confusing morass of station politics that often
becomes quite personal.
"Since there is no [financial] incentive to work
at KZSU, there develops a personal committment
and involvement with the station," said one KZSU
staffer. This personal rather than financial link to
the station thus becomes a source of many
personality conflicts.
Disagreements between the two political factions
center around the retention or abolition of the
newly installed format.
The format, as it stands, requires a programmer
to play six cuts from the format list every hour.
This amounts to about 25 minutes of format music
per hour.
New Format
Dickerson believes that the 60 percent vote he
received in the recent station election, before which
he made it clear that he would install a format, is a
mandate to keep the format. "Student listenership
is intolerably low and we must restore confidence in
the station. We're at a turnover stage and even my
critics will say I'm trying to make needed changes."
Dickerson estimated that 60-70 percent of the

programmers were in favor of the format.
The station plans a survey of student opinion
concerning the new format this quarter.
Shoddy Election
Programmers opposing the new setup say that
Dickerson was elected by the News and Public
Affairs personnel and not by a majority of the
programmers. The DJ's advocate election of the
Programming Director by the programmers.
"The election was pretty shoddily handled in
general," said programmer Cory Boyan. "Votes
were counted before the polls closed and a running
tally was kept. The last votes were literally
announced as they were cast," Boyan added.
He also claimed that the pro-format personnel
attempted to purge the opposition prior to the last
election.
Former Station Manager Lloyd Snook agreed
that it wasn't "the best run election I've ever seen"
but insisted that it would have been "a very stupid
political move" to purge any member of the
opposition prior to the election. A few people, who
were opposed to the new format, were fired before
the election, but Snook said they were asked to
leave for "disciplinary purposes."
He saw no need to change the position of
Programming Director to one elected only by the
programmers. "Everybody in the station should
have a say in which way the station is going," said

Snook.
Boyan agreed with Dickerson that the station's
first obligation is to the student body which
supports KZSU financially through the quarterly fee
assessment. But he disagrees on how the station
should meet that responsibility.
"Our obligation is not to any specific cross
section of the student body, but to all of the
student body. We can offer something no other
station in the area offers — free form stereo radio.
We can make all of the people happy some of the
time instead of some of the people all of the time.
"Therefore, the greatest service that KZSU could
provide is to offer as diverse programming as is
possible," Boyan said.
He added, "I can't deny that there is some
self-interest involved, but that is only natural."
Boyan maintained he was most concerned about
the student body. "It's essential that the students
not get hosed over since they pay for the station,"
said Boyan.
Diverse Format
Former Programming Director Mike Windes said
that KZSU is "providing a more diverse program
now with the format." Windes questions whether
much of the music on the format would be played
in a free "progressive" format.
"The format can guarantee some diversity," said
Gary Fazzino, KZSU station manager.
The programmer has a big opportunity
to play what he wants and to get in
the format," Fazzino said.
'There is a point at which we
shouldn't sacrifice certain things for
the sake of professionalism. We're not
going to sacrifice educational
opportunities and specialized
community service to become a CBS
type organization," Fazzino added.
Non-Students Purged?
Other complaints about the station
management center around the status
of non-student programmers. In the
past non-students have stimulated the
growth of progressive free format
radio. During on-campus rioting in
1970, 1972 and 1972, News and
Public Affairs became the number-one
priority in the station. The ranks of
the non-students dwindled and now
some are charging that they are being
purged.
Dickerson insists that
"non-students are welcome and
essential in the operation of the
station" and that he is only "giving
students a fairer break." The increase
in the number of students joining the
staff, has forced most of the
non-students off the air, however,
since there are no longer enough time
slots to go around.
"There is no conscious effort to
purge the non-students, though it
would be naive to think that we didn't
realize what would happen when we
took on more students," said Snook.

"There is a big hassle here with the
non-students," said Boyan.
"Qualifications are sometimes second
to the fact of whether the person is a
student or not." The non-student can
often help and guide the new recruits,
providing a perspective that might
otherwise be lost."
There have . been suggestions
through KZSU's University liaison
man, Assistant to the Dean on Student
Affairs, Dale Snape, to the station to
make sure that students get every
break possible. "I consider the use of
non-students to be an exception and if
indeed such a need it belies the often
quoted cry of being a
'student-operated station,'" reads a
memo to Snook from Snape.
Stabilize Or Murder?
Intense political squabbles and
personality conflicts seem a way of life
around KZSU in general. "It can't get
any more intense without having
murders in the studios," said Snook.
Former News Director Bob Fuss
thought "there is a lot less hassle then
there used to be" in the days when
station disputes centered around the
amount of air time to which the News
and Public Affairs departments were
entitled.
Snook thought that the situation
"would soon stabilize since there are
enough people coming into the station

Stabilize Or Murder?
Intense political squabbles and
personality conflicts seem a way of life
around KZSU in general. "It can't get
any more intense without having
murders in the studios," said Snook.
Former News Director Bob Fuss
thought "there is a lot less hassle then
there used to be" in the days when
station disputes centered around the
amount of air time to which the News
and Public Affairs departments were
entitled.
Snook thought that the situation
"would soon stabilize since there are
enough people coming into the station
that like the way we're going."
No one seems certain about the
future.
As for the format, "it may or may
not stay; but I think it will remain
from now on in one state or another,"
said Dickerson.
"It's hard to be conclusive," he
added.
Behind the election of Francis Dickerson to his
post as KZSU Programming Director and the
installation of the new programming format is a
confusing morass of station politics that often
becomes quite personal.
"Since there is no [financial] incentive to work
at KZSU, there develops a personal committment
and involvement with the station," said one KZSU
staffer. This personal rather than financial link to
the station thus becomes a source of many
personality conflicts.
Disagreements between the two political factions
center around the retention or abolition of the
newly installed format.
The format, as it stands, requires a programmer
to play six cuts from the format list every hour.
This amounts to about 25 minutes of format music
per hour.
New Format
Dickerson believes that the 60 percent vote he
received in the recent station election, before which
he made it clear that he would install a format, is a
mandate to keep the format. "Student listenership
is intolerably low and we must restore confidence in
the station. We're at a turnover stage and even my
critics will say I'm trying to make needed changes."
Dickerson estimated that 60-70 percent of the

programmers were in favor of the format.
The station plans a survey of student opinion
concerning the new format this quarter.
Shoddy Election
Programmers opposing the new setup say that
Dickerson was elected by the News and Public
Affairs personnel and not by a majority of the
programmers. The DJ's advocate election of the
Programming Director by the programmers.
"The election was pretty shoddily handled in
general," said programmer Cory Boyan. "Votes
were counted before the polls closed and a running
tally was kept. The last votes were literally
announced as they were cast," Boyan added.
He also claimed that the pro-format personnel
attempted to purge the opposition prior to the last
election.
Former Station Manager Lloyd Snook agreed
that it wasn't "the best run election I've ever seen"
but insisted that it would have been "a very stupid
political move" to purge any member of the
opposition prior to the election. A few people, who
were opposed to the new format, were fired before
the election, but Snook said they were asked to
leave for "disciplinary purposes."
He saw no need to change the position of
Programming Director to one elected only by the
programmers. "Everybody in the station should
have a say in which way the station is going," said

Snook.
Boyan agreed with Dickerson that the station's
first obligation is to the student body which
supports KZSU financially through the quarterly fee
assessment. But he disagrees on how the station
should meet that responsibility.
"Our obligation is not to any specific cross
section of the student body, but to all of the
student body. We can offer something no other
station in the area offers — free form stereo radio.
We can make all of the people happy some of the
time instead of some of the people all of the time.
"Therefore, the greatest service that KZSU could
provide is to offer as diverse programming as is
possible," Boyan said.
He added, "I can't deny that there is some
self-interest involved, but that is only natural."
Boyan maintained he was most concerned about
the student body. "It's essential that the students
not get hosed over since they pay for the station,"
said Boyan.
Diverse Format
Former Programming Director Mike Windes said
that KZSU is "providing a more diverse program
now with the format." Windes questions whether
much of the music on the format would be played
in a free "progressive" format.
"The format can guarantee some diversity," said
Gary Fazzino, KZSU station manager.
The programmer has a big opportunity
to play what he wants and to get in
the format," Fazzino said.
'There is a point at which we
shouldn't sacrifice certain things for
the sake of professionalism. We're not
going to sacrifice educational
opportunities and specialized
community service to become a CBS
type organization," Fazzino added.
Non-Students Purged?
Other complaints about the station
management center around the status
of non-student programmers. In the
past non-students have stimulated the
growth of progressive free format
radio. During on-campus rioting in
1970, 1972 and 1972, News and
Public Affairs became the number-one
priority in the station. The ranks of
the non-students dwindled and now
some are charging that they are being
purged.
Dickerson insists that
"non-students are welcome and
essential in the operation of the
station" and that he is only "giving
students a fairer break." The increase
in the number of students joining the
staff, has forced most of the
non-students off the air, however,
since there are no longer enough time
slots to go around.
"There is no conscious effort to
purge the non-students, though it
would be naive to think that we didn't
realize what would happen when we
took on more students," said Snook.

"There is a big hassle here with the
non-students," said Boyan.
"Qualifications are sometimes second
to the fact of whether the person is a
student or not." The non-student can
often help and guide the new recruits,
providing a perspective that might
otherwise be lost."
There have . been suggestions
through KZSU's University liaison
man, Assistant to the Dean on Student
Affairs, Dale Snape, to the station to
make sure that students get every
break possible. "I consider the use of
non-students to be an exception and if
indeed such a need it belies the often
quoted cry of being a
'student-operated station,'" reads a
memo to Snook from Snape.

There have . been suggestions
through KZSU's University liaison
man, Assistant to the Dean on Student
Affairs, Dale Snape, to the station to
make sure that students get every
break possible. "I consider the use of
non-students to be an exception and if
indeed such a need it belies the often
quoted cry of being a
'student-operated station,'" reads a
memo to Snook from Snape.
Stabilize Or Murder?
Intense political squabbles and
personality conflicts seem a way of life
around KZSU in general. "It can't get
any more intense without having
murders in the studios," said Snook.
Former News Director Bob Fuss
thought "there is a lot less hassle then
there used to be" in the days when
station disputes centered around the
amount of air time to which the News
and Public Affairs departments were
entitled.
Snook thought that the situation
"would soon stabilize since there are
enough people coming into the station
that like the way we're going."
No one seems certain about the
future.
As for the format, "it may or may
not stay; but I think it will remain
from now on in one state or another,"
said Dickerson.
"It's hard to be conclusive," he
added.
