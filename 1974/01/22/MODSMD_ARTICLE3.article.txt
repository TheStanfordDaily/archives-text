# KZSU Staff Squabbles Over Programming
## 
### DON COX Second Of Two Parts 
Behind the election of Francis Dickerson to his
post as KZSU Programming Director and the
installation of the new programming format is a
confusing morass of station politics that often
becomes quite personal.
"Since there is no [financial] incentive to work
at KZSU, there develops a personal committment
and involvement with the station," said one KZSU
staffer. This personal rather than financial link to
the station thus becomes a source of many
personality conflicts.
Disagreements between the two political factions
center around the retention or abolition of the
newly installed format.
The format, as it stands, requires a programmer
to play six cuts from the format list every hour.
This amounts to about 25 minutes of format music
per hour.
New Format
Dickerson believes that the 60 percent vote he
received in the recent station election, before which
he made it clear that he would install a format, is a
mandate to keep the format. "Student listenership
is intolerably low and we must restore confidence in
the station. We're at a turnover stage and even my
critics will say I'm trying to make needed changes."
Dickerson estimated that 60-70 percent of the

programmers were in favor of the format.
The station plans a survey of student opinion
concerning the new format this quarter.
Shoddy Election
Programmers opposing the new setup say that
Dickerson was elected by the News and Public
Affairs personnel and not by a majority of the
programmers. The DJ's advocate election of the
Programming Director by the programmers.
"The election was pretty shoddily handled in
general," said programmer Cory Boyan. "Votes
were counted before the polls closed and a running
tally was kept. The last votes were literally
announced as they were cast," Boyan added.
He also claimed that the pro-format personnel
attempted to purge the opposition prior to the last
election.
Former Station Manager Lloyd Snook agreed
that it wasn't "the best run election I've ever seen"
but insisted that it would have been "a very stupid
political move" to purge any member of the
opposition prior to the election. A few people, who
were opposed to the new format, were fired before
the election, but Snook said they were asked to
leave for "disciplinary purposes."
He saw no need to change the position of
Programming Director to one elected only by the
programmers. "Everybody in the station should
have a say in which way the station is going," said

Snook.
Boyan agreed with Dickerson that the station's
first obligation is to the student body which
supports KZSU financially through the quarterly fee
assessment. But he disagrees on how the station
should meet that responsibility.
"Our obligation is not to any specific cross
section of the student body, but to all of the
student body. We can offer something no other
station in the area offers — free form stereo radio.
We can make all of the people happy some of the
time instead of some of the people all of the time.
"Therefore, the greatest service that KZSU could
provide is to offer as diverse programming as is
possible," Boyan said.
He added, "I can't deny that there is some
self-interest involved, but that is only natural."
Boyan maintained he was most concerned about
the student body. "It's essential that the students
not get hosed over since they pay for the station,"
said Boyan.
Diverse Format
Former Programming Director Mike Windes said
that KZSU is "providing a more diverse program
now with the format." Windes questions whether
much of the music on the format would be played
in a free "progressive" format.
"The format can guarantee some diversity," said
