# Old Row Houses Never Die
## Plan Calls For Hurlburt Relocation 
### JAY HARLOW 
Not long after the construction wall
went up around the Claw, graffiti
began to appear. One item reads,
"Row Unite — Save Grove." However,
it's not immediately clear what Grove
is to be saved from.
At present, it appears that Hurlburt
House, the older half of Grove House,
will have to be relocated to make
room for the construction of a new
housing complex for emeritus and
junior faculty.

University Master Planner Oscar
Nelson outlined the changes which are
scheduled to take place on the Row
during the next few years. These
changes will be necessitated not only
by the faculty housing project, but
also by the new law school and the
extension of Campus Drive to
Mayfield Avenue.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
has scheduled a press conference today
at 4:15 p.m. in Grove House to discuss
the future of Grove, the Children's
Center and the emeritus housing plan.
Hurlburt will be the only student
house which will have to be relocated
to make room for the faculty housing.
Nelson stressed that Hurlburt was not
in danger of destruction and is
"structurally sound" enough to merit
relocation. He said that "several sites"

in the Row area were being considered
for the house.
The rerouting of Campus Drive will
have more widespread effects on
student housing. Last summer,
Stillman House — originally a part of
Grove and now housing Columbae —
was moved to its present location. The
new right-of-way for Campus Drive
will pass through the lot formerly
occupied by Stillman, and cut off a
small part of the Lasuen House yard.
Nelson noted that, with the new
location of Campus Drive, the present
road would be closed from Alvarado
Row to Lasuen Street. The Delta
Upsilon (DU) fraternity house, which
is presently adjacent to the new law
school will be relocated between
Columbae and the Beta Theta Pi
house, a location in the middle of the

present road.
Larry Horton, associate dean of
students, said that the funds for the
move and relocation of the DU house
are currently being sought from DU
alumni. Should this fund drive fall
short, the University would have to
"re-evaluate" the priority of retaining
the DU house. Horton added that
there is a constant search for more
older campus houses for student
housing, for which there is a high
demand.
Other houses in the Row area
which would be affected by the Master
Plan during the next few years include
the Bridge, and Mariposa, Owens and
Rogers Houses, currently office space
for the Political Science Department.
