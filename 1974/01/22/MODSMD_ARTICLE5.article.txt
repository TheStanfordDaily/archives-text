# City Council OKs Special 'cs' Status
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
unanimously last night to recommend
to Santa Clara County that Stanford
be given special consideration under
the provisions of the county's
proposed "cs" zone ordinance.
In doing so, the Council reversed its
recommendation of Nov. 26 that
Stanford's proposed amendment to
the "cs" ordinance not be passed. The
Council's previous decision had
precipitated a dispute between the city
and the University.
The "cs" ordinance, designed to
halt indiscriminate urban growth,
would force developers of land
bordering cities to seek annexation
prior to starting any new projects.
Stanford had sought special
consideration, pointing out that the
University provides its own municipal
services in an exemplary manner.
The Council also voted
unanimously last night to change its
resolution of Nov. 12, which had
requested the county to remove all
Stanford lands west of .lunipero Serra
Boulevard from a blanket use permit.
Stanford had protested the
resolution, claiming that removal of
the permit would force the University
to participate in lengthy legal hearings
every time a new building project were
started.
The Council, with Stanford's
encouragement, voted to modify the
Nov. 12 request by asking that only
about 250 acres bordering the city be
removed from the permit.
The details of the issues were
ironed out in a meeting between
University and city officials early this
month.
Neither the previous nor the
current Palo Alto recommendations to
the County Board of Supervisors
would have any effect unless the "cs"
zone ordinance were passed by the
Board.
Prior to voting on the new
resolutions, Mayor Kirke Comstock
expressed his appreciation to the
Stanford and Palo Alto officials who
labored to achieve the compromise.
