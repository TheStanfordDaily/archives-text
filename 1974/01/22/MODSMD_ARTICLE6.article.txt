## No More Lies! 
### 
Congress reassembled yesterday alter a month's recess. It was not
an auspicious time.
Last week's sorry spectacle of President .Nixon's erased tape,
juxtaposed against the very real threat of economic recession, impels
us to call once again for the President's resignation — not only for
what he and his minions have done, hut for what they have failed to
do.
The Presidency is a shambles. As every week s news brings only
more evidence of corruption and mismanagement, Richard Nixon's
administration becomes less capable of the sure action the nation's
problems demand.
The deliberately erased tape (the evidence allows no other plausible
conclusion) is the latest in a long series of attempted deceptions,
suspected misdemeanors, and palpable maladministrations.
It is a familiar litany: the strange milk deal: the ITT case: the
houses at San Clemente and Key Biscayne: the misuse of the CIA, the
FBI, and the IKS; the possibly illegal bombing of Cambodia; the
possible obstruction of justice in the Kllsberg case; the original
cover-up of the Watergate burglary, now almost forgotten, but never
solved. And there is, by many accounts, more to come.
Meanwhile, the nations problems have not disappeared.
Unemployment rises; consumer confidence falls to a depth never
plumbed since the great depression; prices continue to climb. Citizens
of what used to be called "the richest nation on earth lower their
thermostats and consider whether their "energy crisis' is a sham,
engineered for Big Oil's benefit. Health care remains expensive and
inadequate; the aged remain forgotten: the poor and the oppressed
remain poor and oppressed.
Meanwhile, the President remains in seclusion. II we are being
governed at all. it is by men we did not elect, and we find it difficult
to place much trust in Bon Ziegler and Alexander llaig.
The only bright spot is the Middle East, where the superpowers
have preserved the security of their oil reserves by forcing a settlement
neither side may long observe. That is the work of Henry Kissinger,
not Bichard Nixon.
Now, more than ever, we need what President Nixon has called lor
so many times, but has always failed to provide: a new beginning. It
lies within his power to save the nation months ol headless drill. And
if he does not resign, it lies before the House ol Bepresentatives to
bite the bullet, and impeach.

It is a familiar litany: the strange milk deal: the ITT case: the
houses at San Clemente and Key Biscayne: the misuse of the CIA, the
FBI, and the IKS; the possibly illegal bombing of Cambodia; the
possible obstruction of justice in the Kllsberg case; the original
cover-up of the Watergate burglary, now almost forgotten, but never
solved. And there is, by many accounts, more to come.
Meanwhile, the nations problems have not disappeared.
Unemployment rises; consumer confidence falls to a depth never
plumbed since the great depression; prices continue to climb. Citizens
of what used to be called "the richest nation on earth lower their
thermostats and consider whether their "energy crisis' is a sham,
engineered for Big Oil's benefit. Health care remains expensive and
inadequate; the aged remain forgotten: the poor and the oppressed
remain poor and oppressed.
Meanwhile, the President remains in seclusion. II we are being
governed at all. it is by men we did not elect, and we find it difficult
to place much trust in Bon Ziegler and Alexander llaig.
The only bright spot is the Middle East, where the superpowers
have preserved the security of their oil reserves by forcing a settlement
neither side may long observe. That is the work of Henry Kissinger,
not Bichard Nixon.
Now, more than ever, we need what President Nixon has called lor
so many times, but has always failed to provide: a new beginning. It
lies within his power to save the nation months ol headless drill. And
if he does not resign, it lies before the House ol Bepresentatives to
bite the bullet, and impeach.
