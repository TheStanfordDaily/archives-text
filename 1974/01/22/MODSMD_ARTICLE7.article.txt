Concering your column about the
projected merger between Tunisia and
Libya, I would like to add the
following comments:
1. Your statement that Bourguiba
called for the recognition of Israel
provided that it withdraws from all
occupied territories is not quite
accurate. Bourguiba's true position as I
understand it is as follows:
He considers that the creation of
a Jewish state in Palestine is a gross
injustice to the Arab people and the
displacement of the Palestinians
from their homeland is a violation
of their basic human rights.
However, since the United Nations
already recognized Israel and
decided to partition Palestine
between the Jews and the Arabs in
1947, Bourguiba believes that the
Arabs should go along and accept
the partition plan and not the mere
withdrawal of Israel from the
territories occupied since the 1967
war.
2. As far as the projected unity is
concerned, some of the skepticism
that you attribute to the Arab
commentators (although you do not
mention that Egypt, for instance, has
welcomed the unity) is not justified.
This is because in my view, the
differences between Khadafy and
Bourguiba are less differences of
principle than they are of tactics.
For President Bourguiba, the Unity
of the Arabs is a "beautiful idea" — as
he calls it — but it should come step
by step while Khadafy believes that it
can be realized now. The only
difference is actually the timing and
not the principle itself. This is why the
merger decision should not be a
surprise to anybody.
As a matter of fact, in his speech at
the conference of the non-allied
nations that was held last summer in
Algiers, Bourguiba made it clear that

he is going to devote the rest of his life
to the realization of the Arab unity.
So contrary to what you mentioned,
Bourguiba has never "ridiculed" the
idea of unity. Even as far as Israel is
concerned, the difference between
Bourguiba and Khadafy is not as great
as it appears to be. Their difference
does not concern the fact whether the
Jews should exist or not in Palestine.
Both leaders agree that the Jews
born in Palestine have as much claim
to the land as the Palestinian Arabs,
but they differ on how to go about
accommodating the two communities
in the area. While Bourguiba thinks
that the 1947 partition plan is the best
solution, Khadafy wants the
destruction of Israel — again as a State
and not as a people, as the creation of
a Zionist racist ideology, and the
accommodation of the two
communities in a democratic state.
Here again, the difference is one of
tactics and not of principle.
This, however, does not mean that
the skeptics are totally unrealistic.
There are certainly a lot of problems
ahead. We will analyze some of them
in another article, but meanwhile, we
say to the skeptics: "Let us try! And if
we fail, we will try again. After all,
isn't this what life is all about?"

Bravo for Mr. McManus (Daily Jan.

time to point out that the First
Amendment extends protection to
quacks at both ends of the political
spectrum.
