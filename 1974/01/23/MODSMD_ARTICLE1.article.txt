# Row Residents Protest Faculty Housing Project
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
A group of Row residents headed
by ASSU Vice President Jim Friend
said yesterday that "the Row is simply
not the appropriate place" for
construction of a housing complex for
senior and emeriti faculty.
A press conference was held on the
proposed site of the housing project, a
five-acre parcel now containing
Hurlburt House (part of Grove), and
the Stanford daycare center, the old
Stanford Elementary School.
Friend and six other Row residents
announced at the conference "the
unified opposition of a coalition of
Row house residents and the ASSU
Council of Presidents" to the housing
complex and to "any further
development of this land."
At the ASSU Senate meeting last
night Friend stressed that change in
University plans to build the complex,
which the Board of Trustees have
already approved, could happen only
if students voiced strong disapproval.
He said "it's 97 percent sure" the
University will build the complex, but
"we ought to try to influence the
decision."
Vital Center
At the conference yesterday, Grove
residents read a prepared statement
which argued that the 75-year
"heritage of the Row as a vital center
of student residential life is in
jeopardy" due to the construction of
the complex, a 100-unit two- and
three-story cluster. The students
expressed skepticism that the new
buildings could be architecturally
blended with the existing Row houses.
Friend argued that the construction
of the housing complex would have a
"very detrimental environmental
effect" by decreasing the amount of
inner-campus open space. The
statement challenged the University to
reconcile this project with its stated

policy on "breathing space."
The group also complained that
students have been ignored in the
formation of "a major policy decision
with important ramifications both for
present and future Stanford
residents."
Friend stated that the
administration consulted "a handful of
students some years ago" on the
general question of long-range changes
on the Row, but that "no concerted
effort" has been made to maintain
student input through later planning
stages.
No Formal Means
Doug Sterne, a Grove resident,
added that there is "no formal means"
for students to influence decisions
about land use beyond the four or five
students on the University's
Committee on Land and Building
Development, whose effectiveness is
limited.
Friend said the University attempts
"some semblance of constituent
democracy," but that in this decision
it "has not adequately sought student
input." He announced that the ASSU
would hold a special referendum

election "within a month," since "the
preservation of the Row is too
important an issue to be decided
without significant student input."
The ASSU Senate will hold an open
meeting on the issue as soon as
possible with "select University
officials" invited.
Alternative Sites
Sally Harris, a resident of Lasuen
House, said she and other students had
met with University Housing Director
Ed Scoles to discuss alternative sites
which had been considered for the
housing project.
The students said they were not
convinced that some of the other sites,
including the open space adjacent to
Mirrielees House in Escondido Village,
were less desirable than this site.
However, according to Friend, "they
[the administration] insist that this is
head-and-shoulders the most suitable
and economically feasible site."
The students pointed out that while
the Planning Office tends to hand
down rigid decisions which cannot be

changed, attempts to pin them down on future plans usually meet
the same response: the University must maintain maximum
flexibility. As a result, general student reaction usually comes too
late to influence these decisions, they contended.
Sterne claimed that the University views students as a
transient population" whose wishes are therefore not as
important as those of more permanent residents. Friend
challenged the validity of this notion: according to national
statistics, said Friend, the average American family moves every
3.4 years.
