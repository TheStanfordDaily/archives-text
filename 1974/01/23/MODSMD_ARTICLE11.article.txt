# Three Convicted Of Four Felonies
## 'No One Knows Why Ronald Beaty Lied'

On Dec. 21, 1973, a two-week federal trial
concluded with a Phoenix jury convicting me and
two others of four felonies: conspiracy, harboring
an escaped federal prisoner, aiding him in eluding
capture, and concealing his escape from authorities.
My conviction was for engaging in a 45-minute
conversation with a drunken [man],who received no
help from me and who never told me his true
identity.
Ronald Wayne Beaty was allegedly freed by
Venceremos, a now-disbanded organization of Bay
Area revolutionaries. After his recapture he named
some 15 people, some of whom were Venceremos
members, as knowing participants in his escape and
flight. From his[words]about me and two friends
charged with harboring him in Arizona, on the
Navajo Reservation where we were working, I can
only conclude that he hoped to gain favor with the
authorities — and perhaps protect people actually in
on his escape — by apparently "coming clean" and
setting up as many people on the political Left as he
could.
Two people have been convicted of murder and
escape on the basis of Beaty's story. A related
murder trial is now in progress in Los Angeles, and
two more harboring trials will be held soon in San
Jose.
The case against us was based on the
uncorroborated testimony of a government

informer, a man who is also a proven murderer,
kidnapper, heroin peddler, and perjurer. Beaty
admitted — when confronted with previous
testimony — that he has no scruples about lying
under oath.
Not The First Time
This case is not the first in which he tried to save
himself by implicating others: his defense to a charge
of kidnapping two hostages in a 1970 escape was that
they were not his victims, but willing accomplices in
a getaway arranged by the Black Panther Party. The
judge kept this information from our jury, though it
shows Beaty's habit of pursuing his own interests at
the expense of innocent people, as well as his belief
that he will get more mileage out of a story
involving organizations on the Left.
Beaty was free for 66 days. Claiming common
Bay Area acquaintances, he spent three of those
days enjoying the hospitality of Lori and Harry
Bishara at their home on the Reservation. I cannot
believe that they had any idea who he was, and even
the prosecution showed that they hardly treated
him as a badly-wanted fugitive. They took him to a
party, invited me and others to visit while he was
there, and made to effort to destroy a newspaper
describing the escape (but not the escapee) which
Beaty himself had left there.
I was a Stanford law student in an apprenticeship
position with a legal services office on the
Reservation, in a program viewed locally as radical.
Beaty portrayed me as the link with Bruce Franklin,

an ex-English professor at Stanford and leader of
Venceremos whom the informer places at the center
of the "conspiracy."
Very Flimsy Evidence
(To prove my part in it, the prosecution
subpoenaed Stanford records showing that two
years ago there was a six-month period when Mr.
Franklin and I were both at Stanford!) I do not
know Bruce Franklin, my alleged "co-conspirator."
I did not arrange for Ronald Beaty's stop at the
Reservation. To me he appeared to be only a rather
obnoxious example of the many people who
vacation in Navajo country and find places to stay
with friends of friends who reside there.
No one knows why Beaty lied. The extent of his
"cooperation" with authorities did lead to the
dropping of many charges against him, officers'
promises to urge early parole when he is eligible
(after seven years), and other favors. A more subtle
factor is Beaty's repeated naming of Bruce Franklin.
In a taped conversation with Beaty after his
recapture, FBI agents clearly expressed their delight
at an opportunity to get the goods on this
well-known revolutionary figure. Beaty thought he
had pleased his captors, but there was not enough
evidence against Mr. Franklin even for the obtaining
of an indictment.
