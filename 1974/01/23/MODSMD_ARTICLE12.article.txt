# New Policy Proposal
## Land Use Costs And Benefits Examined 
### 
Richard Muth

As an economist with a professional
interest in such matters and a former
member of the University's Land and
Building Development Committee, I
am disturbed by the appraisal of the
costs and benefits of the University's
proposed new land use policy
described in your recent article (Daily,
Friday, Jan. 11, 1974, p. 1).
First, the "full commercial
utilization" of vacant lands at
Stanford, it was reported, would
increase the University's endowment
by about $35 million. At an 8 percent
return per year on endowment, such
an increase would produce $2.8
million more annual income for
Stanford each year — more than half
the annual deficit the well-known
Budget Adjustment Program sought to
eliminate, enough to pay the salaries
of perhaps 125 to 150 faculty
members, or enough to provide 800 to
900 full tuition scholarships. Thus,
while only about 10 percent of the
University's endowment, $35 million
is by no means a trivial amount at a
time when tuition charges continue to
rise and the purchasing power
equivalent of faculty salaries is
declining.
In addition, the estimate of $35
million strikes me as unreasonably
low. Out of 8100 acres, if I recall
correctly, 1200 are currently in
academic use and another 1200 or so
leased for residential, industrial and
commericial development. If "full
commercial utilization" means 5700
acres, a per acre value of about $6
thousand is implied.
If I could buy an undeveloped
quarter-acre lot for $1500 in the
mid-Peninsula area I would certainly
like to know where, as would many
other readers I'm sure. A clue to the
discrepancy is provided by another
article on the same subject (The
Stanford Observer, January 1974, p.
2), which cited 5000 acres as currently
belonging to the academic reserve. If,
instead, "full commercial utilization"
means 700 acres, then a per acre value
of $50 thousand is indicated, a far
more reasonable value in view of what

I know of the area's land market.
An already irrevocable commitment
of 5000 acres to the academic reserve,
however, would mean that the new
university land use policy has already
been adopted de facto and is not
merely proposed. Supposing such is
not the case, and adopting a
conservative value of land of $25,000
per acre, 5700 acres is equivalent to
slightly more than $140 million in
endowment — about 40 percent, not
10 percent, of the current endowment.
The latter, it seems to me, is a far
more sensible estimate of the
opportunity cost to the University of
the proposed new land use policy.
Not only have the costs to Stanford
apparently been grossly
under-estimated, the benefits of the
policy to Stanford seems grossly
overestimated as well. Stanford
currently has about 10 students per
acre of campus land. Reserving 5700
acres for future campus expansion
would imply a university of almost
70,000 students sometime in the
future.
Though it may be properly noted
that no one thirty years ago
anticipated the University's growth
subsequent to World War 11, it is by no
means certain that Stanford will ever
be roughly three times as large as U.S.
Berkeley currently is. Indeed if the
University were able to acquire the
means to provide for buildings and
facilities to instruct, house, and feed
57,000 additional students, the faculty
to teach them, and the staff to manage
everything, finding the land to put it
all upon would seem a comparatively
minor problem.
Admittedly, the calculations noted
above are all of the back-of-the
envelope variety. Since I am no longer
privy to the Unversity's secrets in this
area, like Will Rogers I know only
what I read in the papers. Nor am I
advocating that 5700 acres be
allocated to non -academic land
development, for such is not my
intention. Rather, the quantitative
import of the matters discussed above

is so great to the University that the
costs and benefits to Stanford deserve
a fuller, more careful examination
than was reported in your article. I
would only hope that the President

and Board of Trustees would ask for
such justification before considering
the proposed new policy.

costs and benefits of the University's
proposed new land use policy
described in your recent article (Daily,
Friday, Jan. 11, 1974, p. 1).
First, the "full commercial
utilization" of vacant lands at
Stanford, it was reported, would
increase the University's endowment
by about $35 million. At an 8 percent
return per year on endowment, such
an increase would produce $2.8
million more annual income for
Stanford each year — more than half
the annual deficit the well-known
Budget Adjustment Program sought to
eliminate, enough to pay the salaries
of perhaps 125 to 150 faculty
members, or enough to provide 800 to
900 full tuition scholarships. Thus,
while only about 10 percent of the
University's endowment, $35 million
is by no means a trivial amount at a
time when tuition charges continue to
rise and the purchasing power
equivalent of faculty salaries is
declining.
In addition, the estimate of $35
million strikes me as unreasonably
low. Out of 8100 acres, if I recall
correctly, 1200 are currently in
academic use and another 1200 or so
leased for residential, industrial and
commericial development. If "full
commercial utilization" means 5700
acres, a per acre value of about $6
thousand is implied.
If I could buy an undeveloped
quarter-acre lot for $1500 in the
mid-Peninsula area I would certainly
like to know where, as would many
other readers I'm sure. A clue to the
discrepancy is provided by another
article on the same subject (The
Stanford Observer, January 1974, p.
2), which cited 5000 acres as currently
belonging to the academic reserve. If,
instead, "full commercial utilization"
means 700 acres, then a per acre value
of $50 thousand is indicated, a far
more reasonable value in view of what

I know of the area's land market.
An already irrevocable commitment
of 5000 acres to the academic reserve,
however, would mean that the new
university land use policy has already
been adopted de facto and is not
merely proposed. Supposing such is
not the case, and adopting a
conservative value of land of $25,000
per acre, 5700 acres is equivalent to
slightly more than $140 million in
endowment — about 40 percent, not
10 percent, of the current endowment.
The latter, it seems to me, is a far
more sensible estimate of the
opportunity cost to the University of
the proposed new land use policy.
Not only have the costs to Stanford
apparently been grossly
under-estimated, the benefits of the
policy to Stanford seems grossly
overestimated as well. Stanford
currently has about 10 students per
acre of campus land. Reserving 5700
acres for future campus expansion
would imply a university of almost
70,000 students sometime in the
future.
Though it may be properly noted
that no one thirty years ago
anticipated the University's growth
subsequent to World War 11, it is by no
means certain that Stanford will ever
be roughly three times as large as U.S.
Berkeley currently is. Indeed if the
University were able to acquire the
means to provide for buildings and
facilities to instruct, house, and feed
57,000 additional students, the faculty
to teach them, and the staff to manage
everything, finding the land to put it
all upon would seem a comparatively
minor problem.
Admittedly, the calculations noted
above are all of the back-of-the
envelope variety. Since I am no longer
privy to the Unversity's secrets in this
area, like Will Rogers I know only
what I read in the papers. Nor am I
advocating that 5700 acres be
allocated to non -academic land
development, for such is not my
intention. Rather, the quantitative
import of the matters discussed above

is so great to the University that the
costs and benefits to Stanford deserve
a fuller, more careful examination
than was reported in your article. I
would only hope that the President

and Board of Trustees would ask for
such justification before considering
the proposed new policy.

First, the "full commercial
utilization" of vacant lands at
Stanford, it was reported, would
increase the University's endowment
by about $35 million. At an 8 percent
return per year on endowment, such
an increase would produce $2.8
million more annual income for
Stanford each year — more than half
the annual deficit the well-known
Budget Adjustment Program sought to
eliminate, enough to pay the salaries
of perhaps 125 to 150 faculty
members, or enough to provide 800 to
900 full tuition scholarships. Thus,
while only about 10 percent of the
University's endowment, $35 million
is by no means a trivial amount at a
time when tuition charges continue to
rise and the purchasing power
equivalent of faculty salaries is
declining.
In addition, the estimate of $35
million strikes me as unreasonably
low. Out of 8100 acres, if I recall
correctly, 1200 are currently in
academic use and another 1200 or so
leased for residential, industrial and
commericial development. If "full
commercial utilization" means 5700
acres, a per acre value of about $6
thousand is implied.
If I could buy an undeveloped
quarter-acre lot for $1500 in the
mid-Peninsula area I would certainly
like to know where, as would many
other readers I'm sure. A clue to the
discrepancy is provided by another
article on the same subject (The
Stanford Observer, January 1974, p.
2), which cited 5000 acres as currently
belonging to the academic reserve. If,
instead, "full commercial utilization"
means 700 acres, then a per acre value
of $50 thousand is indicated, a far
more reasonable value in view of what

I know of the area's land market.
An already irrevocable commitment
of 5000 acres to the academic reserve,
however, would mean that the new
university land use policy has already
been adopted de facto and is not
merely proposed. Supposing such is
not the case, and adopting a
conservative value of land of $25,000
per acre, 5700 acres is equivalent to
slightly more than $140 million in
endowment — about 40 percent, not
10 percent, of the current endowment.
The latter, it seems to me, is a far
more sensible estimate of the
opportunity cost to the University of
the proposed new land use policy.
Not only have the costs to Stanford
apparently been grossly
under-estimated, the benefits of the
policy to Stanford seems grossly
overestimated as well. Stanford
currently has about 10 students per
acre of campus land. Reserving 5700
acres for future campus expansion
would imply a university of almost
70,000 students sometime in the
future.
Though it may be properly noted
that no one thirty years ago
anticipated the University's growth
subsequent to World War 11, it is by no
means certain that Stanford will ever
be roughly three times as large as U.S.
Berkeley currently is. Indeed if the
University were able to acquire the
means to provide for buildings and
facilities to instruct, house, and feed
57,000 additional students, the faculty
to teach them, and the staff to manage
everything, finding the land to put it
all upon would seem a comparatively
minor problem.
Admittedly, the calculations noted
above are all of the back-of-the
envelope variety. Since I am no longer
privy to the Unversity's secrets in this
area, like Will Rogers I know only
what I read in the papers. Nor am I
advocating that 5700 acres be
allocated to non -academic land
development, for such is not my
intention. Rather, the quantitative
import of the matters discussed above

is so great to the University that the
costs and benefits to Stanford deserve
a fuller, more careful examination
than was reported in your article. I
would only hope that the President

and Board of Trustees would ask for
such justification before considering
the proposed new policy.
