# Contralto With S.F. Symphony
## Baker's Voice Steals Show 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
A capacity crowd cheered
contralto Janet Baker, who joined
Maestro Seiji Ozawa and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
a breathtaking concert featuring
works by J.C. Bach, Mahler and
Richard Strauss last Wednesday
evening.
The most breathtaking
moments belonged to Baker's
interpretation of Mahler's five late
songs on poems of Friedrich
Rueckert. Baker is unquestionably
one of the finest singers alive
today; her golden tone and
faultless musicianship brought
every nuance in these
masterpieces of vibrant life.
The musical world has heaped
honors on Janet Baker; the
University of Leeds awarded her a
doctorate in music, and Queen
Elizabeth named her a
Commander of the Order of the
British Empire in 1970. Mahler's
music is a specialty of hers, but
she has also performed operatic
roles in leading Continental and
American houses as well as
recording a considerable portion
of the solo repertoire.
Superb Mahler Singing
From the opening notes of
"Ich atmet' einen Linden Duft"
("I sensed a gentle frangrance") to
the moving conclusion of "Ich bin
der Welt abhanden gekommen"
("I have withdrawn from the
world"), Baker held the audience
in the palm of her vocal hand. Her
voice, at once full-bodied and
ethereal, carressed Mahler's tender
passages enchantingly, and poured
a flood of beauty through each
musical climax. Better Mahler
singing than this is difficult to
imagine.

Choosing a personal favorite
among these five songs can only
be a matter of taste, but mine is
probably "Liebst du um
Schoenheit" ("If you love for
beauty"). Baker's rapturous
performance made this work a
trancendent musical experience
for me and, I'm certain, for many
others.
Johann Christian Bach's
"Sinfonia for Double Orchestra"
opened the evening's program. A
master of the stile galante, J.C.
Bach gave his best musical efforts
to this piece for two balanced
orchestras of strings and winds;
Maestro Ozawa's instrumentalists
responded with a clean, concise
performance. Occasionally more
elastic phrasing and a completely
audible harpsichord would have
been nice, but the performers'
musicality and verve made up for
such defects.
Post-Romantic Ending
Wednesday's concert came to a
heavy but surprising satisfying
close with Richard Strauss'
massive and — to my own taste —
overblown symphonic poem Ein
Heldenleben. The hero whose life

and adventures Ein Heldenleben
celebrates is Strauss himself, and
he overlooked few chances to
wield his post-Romantic musical
pen with a vengeance through
fifty minutes of hyperemotional
autobiography.
Concert hall war-horses like
Ein Heldenleben too often receive
merely routine performances, but
Maestro Ozawa and company
buckled down to the task at hand
and delivered an infectiously
exciting reading which the
audience loved. The hero's
opening theme ebbed and swelled
with life, the orchestra's massed
percussion and brass roared
convincingly across "The Hero's
Battlefield," and the final
moments of "The Hero's Escape
from the World" were lovely.
Concertmaster Stuart Canin's
extended cadenza portraying
"The Hero's Companion" was
particularly brilliantly played.
Canin always seems to do himself
proud in solo passages, but his
spontaneity, keen pitch, and
impassioned phrasing were as
good, if not better, than usual
here. Bravo, Mr. Canin!
