# New Kerr Comedy Hurts A Bit
## 
### PATTY FELS 
SAN FRANCISCO - A Jean
Kerr comedy is light, witty, filled
with children and dogs and, above
all, happily naive, right? Well,
maybe. But Finishing Touches,
now playing at the Curran
Theatre, is a far cry from Please
Don 7 Eat The Daises.
This time Kerr has dealt with
some of life's uncomfortable
realities — and it hurts. For the
first time, the laughter is a little
strained and the effervescent
atmosphere so characteristic of
her comedies seems almost
out-of-place.
To begin with, the situation is
uncomfortable. A middle-aged
professor with a kind,
understanding wife and three nice
kids, who falls in love with first a
student and then his son's
girlfriend, is not the stuff of
which comedies are made — at
least not Jean Kerr comedies. The
audience can't ignore the gnawing
certainty that this is not Bob and
Carol and Ted and Alice but a
genuine, loving, close-knit family.
The father's infatuations are
too potentially destructive to be

funny and the audience loses
respect for him when he starts
behaving more immaturely than
his 18-year-old son. Consequently,
the only possible response to his
worries about becoming 40 and
losing his sexual attraction is the
sincere wish that he would grow
up.
Not Really Funny
Against this background, the
play's sub-plots only intensify the
audience's sense that the whole
situation is not really so funny. In
any other play, the revelation that
a college student is living with his
girlfriend would be good for a few
laughs but hardly shocking; here it
is neither funny nor easily
brushed-off. The very attitudes
that one dislikes the father for —
his casual sense of responsibility,
his lack of any real feeling for the
young girls to whom he is
attracted — are mirrored in the
son's comment when his girlfriend
leaves the house — "Goddamn it,
my books were in the back seat of
her car!"
Most depressing of all is the
feeling that the mother's world is
pretty much collapsing around her

and that no one — except the next
door neighbor — cares or even
notices. And he uses it to try to
get her to bed. Her clumsy
attempts to say what she thinks
one should say before "an
assignation" are not funny but
unfortunately pathetic.
Perhaps the only real flaw in
the play was billing it as "the
laugh hit of 1973" when its real
power lies in the hard-hitting
defense of the family unit and the
general stability of a society
which attends to its mores.
Nevertheless, Finishing Touches
never becomes preachish; it is
always highly entertaining. Kerr is
experimenting with a new type of
subject matter which does not fit
her traditional comic style. She
will have to give up one or the
other next time to produce a
successful play.
Professional Cast
The San Francisco cast is very
professional. Four of the
performers — Barbara Bel Geddes
(the mother), Robert Lansing (the
father), Gene Rupert (the

neighbor) and Denis Galik (the
student) — are from the original
Broadway cast. Bel Geddes played
in Mary, Mary, another Kerr play,
which was the 13th longest
running Broadway stage play in
history.
Although critics have
generally liked the play, The
New Yorker responded with what
may well be the most pretentious
review of all times. It first mocks
the father for worrying about his
promotion — "For the hero of
Finishing Touches, three o' clock
in the morning is not the hour at
which he faces the dark night of
the soul but that at which he
wonders whether he will achieve
his long-awaited full
professorship" — and then,
unsatisfied, turns on the mother,
chastizing her for "padding
around the house in grisly
sneakers and sagging pants" after
she realizes that her husband is
straying. Finally, reviewer
Brendan Gill self-righteously
asserts that he doesn't know any
people like that.
