# Tjader Quintet Sticks With Successful Jazz Formula

### VICKI LaBRIE 
SAN FRANCISCO - The Cal
Tjader performance Friday night,
Jan. 18, at the Great American
Music Hall was transformed into a
dance concert as Latin rhythms
lured couples from their tables
onto the dance floor in the middle
of the room.
The first song began with
Chick Corea-like sounds and then
picked up a Latin beat, fortified
with electric bass and electric
piano, the full sound flowing
smoothly to the 100 or so people.
The quintet â€” pianist Mike
Wolfe, drummer Dick Berk, bassist
Harvey Newmark, conga player
Michael Smith, and vibist Tjader
rarely played more than two songs
in a row with the whole group
together or each member on the

same instrument. The complete
group renders the sound that is
identified with the name of Cal
Tjader. The numbers excluding
Smith sound like most other trios
and quartets.
Smith joined in on "Philly
Mambo" and they were working
and cooking together, more so
than when they were here in
April. The beat got inside the
audience and carried you to a
frenzied summit, then down
again. It was the best performance
I've seen of Tjader.
Wolfe was spotlighted during
"Stella by Starlight," with a loud
and uninspired drum solo by
Berk.
The second set gave way to
more Latin rhythms as the dance
floor filled up. The up-tempo

tunes featured tireless riffs that
built up to a climax threaded with
solos by Wolfe, Tjader, or
Newmark. Wolfe, in contrast to
the fast tunes, offered Johnny
Green's "Body and Soul" which
tightened up after a few
unnecessary arpeggios.
Tjader was wandering in and
out of the set-up all night, soloing
first on vibes, then taking a turn
at the timbales and electric piano.
All in all, he was pretty inactive
while Wolfe took most of the
solos.
Cal Tjader has been in the
business for 20 years, and with his
present group for two or three
years. He has conjured up a recipe
for a continuing career
and popularity, doing what he does
well without blazing new paths in
jazz music.
