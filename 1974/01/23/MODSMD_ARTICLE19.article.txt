The Committee on Black
Performing Arts presents actual
performances or exhibitions in the
areas of drama, dance, music and
photography. The past four years
have been a struggle to implement
this program but with student
support and involvement the
Committee can continue to grow,
develop and secure outstanding
artists.
The new members of the
Committee, Jim Shields and Janis
Miller, will be directing the music
and choreography of the
Committee's Spring production,
the West Coast premiere of Purlie,
an adaptation of Ossie Davis*
Purlie Victorious.
Jim Shields is a guest lecturer
in the Music Dept. He is a noted
french horn and saxaphone player
as well as an accomplished
vocalist. He has performed in the
Carmel Beach Festival, the San
Francisco Opera Company, and
the School of Orpheus.
