# Pre-Med Depicts Trend
## Grades Stifle Learning 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
"The process of credentialing gets in
the way of the process of education,"
said Frank Newman, director of
University Relations, on KZSU's
Campus Conference Monday night.
The discussion was based on the
most recent of a series of federal
reports on higher education, put
together by a task force headed by
Newman. The reports were
commissioned by HEW and funded by
the Ford Foundation.
Newman cited pre-medical students
as an example of students who attend
college only as a prerequisite for their
next goal. These people spend four
years working hard for top grades
instead of striving for a broad liberal
arts education, he said.
Education Is Casualty
"Education is a casualty in that
situation," Newman commented.
Newman said that the task force
first considered trying to avoid an
over-emphasis on "becoming
qualified" in higher education, but
then gave up that approach as
unrealistic. Instead, the report suggests
ways to make this need for academic
credentials more equitable.
Newman said he does not approve
of federal control of education. He
suggested only that government
provide incentives for professional
schools to consider the specialized
abilities and motivations of a student,
rather than his college grade point
average and standardized test scores.

One of the suggestions Newman
discussed was "examining
universities," where students are tested
and evaluated. These centers would
not provide instruction or require
years of study in one place, but would
consider the work a student had done
both at established institutions and on
his own to determine his
qualifications.
Different Bias
As it is, Newman said, "the job
marketplace has a different bias."
Business employers, for example,
rarely worry about grades or where a
student got his degree if they believe
his personal qualifications are
appropriate.
One of the conclusions of the report
was that higher education is no longer
as valuable as it used to be, Newman
reported. When only 10 percent of an
age group received a degree, he
explained, education correlated well
with good jobs and social position.
"That was great, up until the time
that 50 percent of the population
went to college," Newman said. Now
there are more people qualified on
paper for the available jobs. Other
college-educated people will have to be
"alternately employed," he said,
considering the current job
opportunities for professionals.
Needs Of Seventies
The first report the task force
published investigated how well higher
education is meeting the needs of the
19705. The most recent study was to

determine the appropriate position for
the federal government concerning
higher education.
"At an undergraduate level we made
a national decision several years
ago ... that there should be room for
everybody," said Newman.
For graduate work, however,
Newman said that education for
everybody would waste both the
money it takes to run schools and the
time of the students. Medical schools,
for example, are very expensive and
could not afford to train more doctors
than are necessary.
