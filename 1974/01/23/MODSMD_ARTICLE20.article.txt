## Can Boxing Be Revived? 
### Don Tollefson 
Perhaps the greatest mouth in boxing history
will return to the ring Monday night when
Muhammad Ali tries to gain long-awaited revenge
against Joe Frazier in a fight which over anxious
promoters are billing as the second "Fight of the
Century."
Since they met almost three years ago in one of
the classic battles in boxing history, time has taken
a considerable toll on each man. Many boxing
observers feel the toll has been too great and that
Monday night will mark the real finale of both
men's illustrious careers. Some even cynically
predict a double knockout.
Ali's mouth has hardly been slowed at all, but
his footwork and punches have lost considerable
speed. And many people feel Frazier will never
recover from the battering he took at the hands of
George Foreman last January.
It has been almost 10 years since a brash young
fighter named Cassius Clay took the title from
Sonny Liston. Clay's meteoric climb to the top was
followed by the kind of consistent brilliance which
soon had boxing nuts arguing again over who was
the greatest heavyweight of all time.
But soon an inevitable conflict between Ali's
religious convictions and draft would come to the
forefront, and after defeating Zora Folley in 1967,
Ali would not fight again for three years. Anyone
who steps into a boxing ring has courage, but Ali
demonstrated the courage which befits a champion
when he refused induction and went to prison.
While Ali was suffering the inevitable physical
deterioration that accompanies a long layoff,
Frazier moved into the heavyweight spotlight with
one of the strongest punches in boxing history.
Respected Ability
Everyone respected Frazier's ability, but he
wasn't given full recognition as the heavyweight
king until he stopped Jimmy Ellis in February
1970.
When Ali started on the comeback trail,
everyone knew that it would only be a matter of
time until he would challenge Frazier for the crown
which he felt had been unjustly stolen from him.
Over 300 million people around the world
watched on closed circuit TV when the "Fight of
the Century" finally took place on March 8, 1971
in Madison Square Garden.
Ali had recaptured a considerable amount of his
previously brilliant form, but he was meeting a man
who was at the peak of his boxing career. Frazier's
sledgehammer body punches wore down Ali and
the champ finally connected on two solid head
shots in the late rounds to ensure a unanimous
decision.
Boxing enthusiasts hoped that a fight which had
generated so much international excitement might
propel boxing back to a stature it had long lacked.

But their optimism was shortlived and since then,
waning popularity has continued to plague the
sport.
Difficult Problems
The optimists again hope that Monday's
Madison Square Garden fight can start the sport on
a popularity climb, but boxing currently faces
problems which may be impossible to overcome.
It is ironic that as simple and ancient a sport as
boxing has suffered more than most sports from
the ills which have become a large part of modern
professional athletics. Big money and its constant
companion, big business, are high on the list of
villains.
Current champion George Foreman is nearly
broke as a result of having been tricked and conned
by promoters, consultants and other assorted types
who have become collectively known as "fistic
capitalists."
Foreman's problems are boxing's problems. The
get-rich-quick attitude which has overrun the sport
has led to farcical championship bouts between
heavyweight champions and human punching bags.
How can the sport's popualrity help but wane
when Frazier's two title defenses in 1972 were
against immortals like Ron Stander and Terry
Daniels. Stander's wife showed considerable insight
when following Frazier's bloody destruction of her
husband, she said, "I'm a realist. You don't enter a
Volkswagen at Indy unless you know a helluva
shortcut."
Easy Warm up
Some observers feel that Frazier's staff ironically
planned last year's fight with Foreman as another
easy money warmup for an anticipated title
rematch with Ali. Foreman derailed that plan
rather quickly.
Frazier now has to face Ali not in a title
rematch, but in a bout he must win in order to even
have a chance at regaining the title. One local
boxing writer says that if Ali wins, he will be "too
smart" to face Foreman. What is clear amidst all
these rumors is that someone will have to win
convincingly on Monday to get a match with the
winner of the March 28 Foreman-Ken Norton fight.
It is hard to determine whether his financial
problems are the sole cause, but it is clear that since
becoming champion, Foreman has done little to
change the recent tradition of champs wasting their
time fighting also-rans. His one round fight last
June with Joe Roman did nothing but worsen
boxing's already badly tarnished image.
The chances are slim, but the Ali-Frazier
rematch could begin a revival of boxing's glory. If
someone wins convincingly, and for justice's sake I
certainly hope it is Ali, and then later fights the
Foreman-Norton winner, boxing may be lifted out
of its decline. But don't count on it.

BAD WEEKENDS—Both Tim Patterson (55), whose Stanford team
lost to Utah and Air Force, and Dave Meyers (34) whose UCLA
Bruins had their winning streak snapped at 88, suffered through
painful weekends. Patterson hopes for a recovery Friday night against
Denver, while Meyers will seek revenge Saturday night when the
Bruins host Notre Dame at Pauley Pavilion.

SET FOR ANOTHER SEASON—Junior Bob Anderson will be one of
the key performers this weekend when Stanford opens its 1974
gymnastics season in a triangular competition against California and
Oregon. Optional exercises will be Friday night at Berkeley, with the
compulsories set for Saturday at 8 p.m. at Maples Pavilion. Anderson
is returning to action after sitting out the latter part of last season
because of personal reasons.
