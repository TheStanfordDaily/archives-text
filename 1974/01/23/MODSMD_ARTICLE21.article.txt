# Lost Weekend In Rockies
## Frustrated Cardinals Return Home 
### 
Stanford's basketball team
returned home yesterday feeling
tired, miserable and frustrated.
The Cards, who lost 91-82 to
Utah Saturday night and dropped
a 75-68 decision to Air Force
Monday, are now 5-9 going into
Friday night's game against
Denver at Maples Pavilion.
And Howie Dallmar has a sore

throat, in addition to the obvious
headaches.
"I couldn't yell at all," Dallmar
moaned yesterday. "That was
really frustrating."
There were other frustrating
happenings. Like 24 fouls called
against Stanford Monday,
compared to only 13 against Air
Force. And the fact that both

regular referees were snowbound
and never reached the game. They
were replaced by what team
manager Mark Florant called "a
couple of Little League
local-yokuls."
But that excuse has been tried
before. "I don't want to use that
as an alibi again," said stunned
assistant coach Billy Jones when
he heard about the loss last night.
(Jones didn't accompany the team
on the trip.)
Dallmar said Air Force "simply
outplayed us. They hustled,
scrapped and shot well."
"We started with a zone
defense," Dallmar said, "and they
shot the eyes out of the basket.
Then we went man-to-man, and
they ran around us and through
us."
Stanford trimmed its turnover

total to a halfway respectable 16
against the Falcons, but Air Force
had only seven miscues. The
Falcons outrebounded the Cards
44-42, which was especially
amazing since Stanford's starting
lineup averages 6-7 while Air
Force's tallest player is 6-7. But he
didn't play Monday, so the tallest
Falcon on the court was 6-5.
"They made up for their lack
of height with hard work and
determination," Dallmar said.
Stanford's only highlight was
another outstanding performance
by Rich Kelley, wht) scored 25
points and grabbed 19 rebounds.
For the season, Kelley is now
averaging 17.4 points and 12.8
rebounds. He's shooting .460
from the field and .756 from the
line.
