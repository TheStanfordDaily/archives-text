Kissinger Expects End To Embargo
WASHINGTON — The unrestricted flow of Arab oil to the
United States may resume in less than two months as a result of
the Egyptian-Israeli troop agreement, Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger indicated yesterday.
"I have every reason to believe that our success in the
negotiations mark a major step toward ending the oil embargo,"
Kissinger told reporters.
He laid out no specific timetable, but he said "I think in more
ambitious terms," when asked if the boycott end was linked to
the final implementation of troop separation along the Suez
Canal.
Kissinger's report was one of several optimistic signs on the
subject yesterday.
At a news conference in Algiers, President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt indicated that the Arabs should alter their oil embargo of
the United States because Washington "has adopted a new
policy" in the Mideast.
In Israel, Premier Golda Meir won parliamentary approval for
her agreement to pull Israeli forces back from the Suez Canal,
clearing the way for separation of the Egyptian and Israeli armies

to begin Friday.
According to the agreement signed last week, Egypt and Israel
must complete the disengagement within 40 to 60 days. The
process is expected to start Friday.
Consumer Prices Up 8.8 Percent
WASHINGTON — Inflation clipped almost nine cents off the
dollar's purchasing power in 1973 as consumer prices rose 8.8
percent, the most in any year since the lifting of World War II
price controls.
The year-end figure came with the Labor Department's report
Tuesday that the Consumer Price Index, led by soaring food and
fuel prices, rose five-tenths of 1 percent seasonally adjusted in
December.
American Pilots May Still Be Held
WASHINGTON — Eight to 10 American pilots still hare being
held as prisoners by the North Vietnamese, Rep. Benjamin A.
Oilman said he has been told.
The New York Republican said yesterday he learned the
information on a trip he made to Laos for the House Foreign
Affairs Committee on Jan. 6. He was in Laos for about a week.
Gilman said Lao Gen. Vang Pao, commander of a military
region in Laos, told him of the prisoners.
Pao could get no information on the identies of the men,
when they were shot down or how long they have been held,
Gilman said.
Pentagon officials said the report was new to them and they
would investigate.
New Program To Aid Homebuyers
WASHINGTON — For homebuyers lucky enough to find the
right price, monthly mortgage payments will be as much as $15
lower under the government's new interest-support program.
The Housing and Urban Development Department expects the
plan will induce some Americans, many priced out of the housing
market in the past year, to buy homes. But the total impact is not
expected to be massive.
Under the program, announced in Houston Monday by HUD
Secretary James E. Lynn, 200,000 home buyers can qualify for
government-backed home loans with a 7 3 A percent interest rate,
one half percent below the government ceiling.
Hayakawa Seeks Election Opportunity
SAN FRANCISCO — Dr. S.I. Hayakawa, former president of
San Francisco State University, yesterday asked the state
Supreme Court to order that he be certified as a candidate for
U.S. Senator without being required to observe the 12-month
party affiliation provision of the state Election Code.
Hayakawa and David T. Daze brought the action against
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. and Marin County Clerk
George N. Gnoss.
The educator said he had been a registered Democrat from
1955 until Aug. 31, 1973 when he changed his registration to
Republican. Daze joined the petition as a registered Republican
who desires to vote for Hayakawa for U.S. Senator in the June

Primary and the November election.
liayakawa said Cnoss refused to certify him as a candidate for
senator in the June primary solely because of a provision of the
Election Code which prohibits such certification if the person was
a member of a different political party within the 12-month
period before he files for office. Hayakawa said he is otherwise
qualified to run and the 12-month requirement
unconstitutionally restricts his right to seek public office.
Militants Evicted From Assembly
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Northern Ireland's
trouble-plagued provincial assembly broke up in disorder
yesterday with militant and moderate Protestant legislators
trading punches over a place to sit.
It took six hefty security men to carry out the Rev. Lan
Paisley, a burly hardline leader. As he was dumped outside,
Paisley boomed: "We shall be back."
Paisley had vowed before the session, the first since the
province's new government took office, that his supporters would
occupy the front-bench seats allocated to chief executive Brian
Faulkner and his coalition administration of moderate Protestants
and Roman Catholics.
The trouble flared when Faulkner and his men tried to take
their seats — and Paisley's supporters refused to move.
Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, shouted:
"You'll not jackboot us with your armored cars and your British
army."
He was referring to the reinforced cordon of troops and police
that ringed the Stormont assembly building, on Belfast's
outskirts, in expectation of trouble with hardline Protestants.
Behind the brawl was the militants' vow to wreck the assembly
and Faulkner's coalition executive, the first in the province's
53-year history to allow Catholics to share power with the
majority Protestants.
Today's Weather
Fair but with variable high clouds at times through tomorrow.
Not so cold at night. Lows tonight in 40s. Highs both days in mid
50s to mid 60s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.
