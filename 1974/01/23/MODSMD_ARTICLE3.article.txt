# Med Center Commuters Use Shuttle-Bus Service
## 
### JON SWERDLOW 
The Medical Center has begun a
shuttle-bus line from the Medical
School to the Palo Alto train
depot. Although now limited in
operation, the system may help
solve Stanford commuting
problems.
The shuttle-bus was instituted
by Jim McNally, assistant director
for support services at the Medical
Center, as part of an overall
energy saving program.
The bus makes four trips daily;
in the morning at 7 and 7:30 and
in the evening at 5:15 and 5:45.
Service is free to anyone
connected to the University. As of
now, however, the bus is
operating below maximum
capacity, carrying only about 10
passengers per trip.
Irregular Trains
Thomas Harder, industrial
engineering staff assistant at the
Medical Center, pointed to the
irregular train service in Palo Alto,
as well as the lack of available
parking at the train station itself
as possible explanations for the
project's slow start. He also noted
that "the Santa Clara bus which
comes to Stanford takes some of
the load which the shuttle-bus was
expected to carry."
Although there are no present
plans to enlarge the route of the
shuttle-bus, McNally added that
"we will be very willing to extend
service to the rest of the campus
sometime in the future."
Car Pools
The medical school has also
implemented a car-pooling

system, similar to the one
proposed in a SWOPSI
transportation report two years
ago.
The report advocated making
transportation facilities more
easily available to Stanford
students, and among its proposals
was the creation of "a
transportation office ... which
will publicize and arrange
chartered buses and car-pools for
present and prospective Stanford
commuters."
Some continue to express
doubt on the feasibility of such a
system. "Car-pooling won't work
until you force people into it or
unless you take away their
gasoline," one staff member
claimed.
Transport Board
However, there are car-pooling
programs for both the entire
medical center and for the
engineering department. Each
system involves a transportation
board which serves to locate
prospective drivers and riders.
In order to encourage
car-pooling in the engineering
department, incentives such as
preferential parking have been
given to cars participating in the
system.
Harder, while admitting that
energy saving projects such as the
shuttle-bus and car-pooling have
not totally caught on, forecasted
that "if the cost of gasoline
becomes significantly higher, or if
rationing is begun, these projects
may become much more
important."
