# Campus Crime Levels Off
## Precautions Lessen; Killing Scare Fades 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
The fright which gripped the
campus after the murder of David
Levine last September is fading, and
many students are relaxing the
precautions which, for a while, they
took seriously.
Several Stanford police officers say
that students are back to their casual
— and possibly risky — habits. "At two
o'clock in the morning, you see people
sitting on top of the mausoleum stairs
and talking," says patrol officer
Deborah Whittemore.
Sgt. Herman Williams, 15-year
veteran of the force, says, "You run
across some guy meditating on the
lawn in his shorts at about four in the
morning." To untangle suspicious
behavior from the morass of campus
activity, Williams says he has
developed a "sixth sense."
He compensates for students and
staff who daily lose their common
sense and forget to take sensible
precautions against crime. Williams
speculates, "They [students] probably
come from back home where the folks
didn't lock the doors and everybody's
honest."
Purse Snatched
However, the freshman girl who
naively deposited her purse in her rear
bicycle basket and later discovered it
missing, learned quickly that the Farm
isn't free from crime.
Swiped wallets and tape decks
stolen from parked cars pose everyday
problems for campus police. Vicious
crimes are aberrations, says Police
Services Director Marvin Herrington.
"We're as secure a campus as the
situation dictates right now."
The wave of violence sweeping
colleges across the nation, forcing
some even to install emergency
telephones, has not hit here,
Herrington asserts. He explains the
Levine murder, for example, as a
"freak incident."
Drastic Increase
Herrington concedes, "We've had a
drastic increase in ordinary crime in
the past 10 years, but that has leveled
off quite a bit so that we are about
caught up with the surrounding
communities.
"Any increase in the number of
crimes (reported) can be explained by
the fact that we have more people
[patrolmen] out doing something
about it — not that there is any
increase in crime. It's just that we
know about it now." Herrington hopes
to build his .staff to 55 men and
women. Presently, between two and

three men continuously patrol campus
in addition to a supervisory sergeant
and, occasionally, regular Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies.
Subtle changes in campus crime
patterns are hard to detect, Herrington
insists. He cited, however, the obvious
decrease in the amount of "malicious
mischief" and "damage for no reward"
done by demonstrators.
Statistics Don't Tell
Statistics, often unavailable, do not
always support the assertion that
campus crime is under control. The
clearance rate, or percentage of crimes
solved, is at Herrington's best guess
"not very high." He explains, "It's
very difficult when you've got such a
transient population to follow things
up. Students graduate or move away,
so you have to start proceedings
almost immediately, before they
leave."
Unreported crime poses as big a
problem as unsolved crime. Herrington
estimates roughly that 50 to 60
percent of campus crime is reported.
"We know this because when I've sent
a man over to a dorm to take a report
on a stolen wallet, while he's over
there, he'll find several other people
who come up to him and say 'I had

mine stolen too, about a week ago.' "
Sociology graduate student Pat
Lauderdale, who led a course last
quarter on "Crime on the Stanford
Campus," has studied unreported
campus crime by asking students for
"self-reports." "I ask them to mention
incidents when they have been
involved in crime and not reported it.
Not Nice And Polite
"I've discovered that Stanford isn't
the nice, polite, non-criminal
community people think it is," he
says. However, "the proof is not the
kind I want to put into the
newspaper."
Lauderdale says his study shows
"there's a dope cycle here. A lot of
students are buying heavy dope off
people in East Palo Alto. Then they
yell about off-campus people coming
onto campus [to steal] when they,
themselves, are initiating the violence.
They are the casual agents of the
crime."
Herrington confirms that dope
dealers have been the target of armed
robbery. "But there have been no
cases of that kind in a year or a year
and a half. Whether dealers are more
careful. I don't know .. . Generally
the people who are robbing drug users
are dangerous or pretty hard types."
Dealing may take place beyond
police eyesight, Lauderdale contends,
and the same holds true of sexual
assault, according to Dana Weigent, a
member of the Rape Collective, who
taught a course called "Rape at
Stanford" a year ago.
Stanford women are more likely to
be raped and less likely to report it,
she says."I think women are much
less apt to report or press charges
against a person she knows."
Although women still may feel
uncomfortable reporting sexual
assaults, relations between students
and police are generally improving.
Williams says,"I get along well with
Stanford students." Lauderdale put it
differently: "Students are less resistant
to police power on campus."
