# ASSU Flicks Heist Inquiries Thwarted
## 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
The Stanford Department of Public
Safety has reached a dead-end in its
two-month investigation of the
disappearance from a safe in its office
of a bag containing $717. The money,
part of the cash receipts from a
showing of an ASSU Sunday Flick,
was apparently stolen last Nov. 26 or
27, according to Public Safety
Director Marvin Herrington.
Herrington has interviewed about
40 people who have regular access to
the safe, which is unlocked during the
day, but he said he suspects no one.
"We're down to the point now," he
said, "where we don't have any leads
left."
Herrington said all the members of
his department have given him
statements offering to take polygraph
(lie-detector) tests. No tests would be
given, however, unless "we uncovered
some other evidence," Herrington said.
Herrington plans to question two
other persons. "They are outside the
department," he added. After that,
"unless we get a break," Herrington
said, it is doubtful the money will ever

be recovered or the thief caught.
Herrington has established a
22-hour period during which the
money must have been stolen. There
were two or three intervals of about
20 minutes each when the unlocked
safe was left unattended.
"Just about anybody could have
done it," Herrington said. The safe is
located in an office used by police, fire
and clerical personnel. The area near
the safe is accessible to anyone with
business in the office.
The money was originally entrusted
to the department until it could be
transferred to a bank safe-deposit box.
The cash was put into an office safe
that is not normally used for valuables,
but rather for holding important
documents, Herrington said.
Since the theft, the department has
been reluctant to accept cash for
safe-keeping, and will do so "only in
an emergency situation," Herrington
said. "We will not routinely accept
receipts anymore."
The loss of the cash was covered by
insurance, and the ASSU Sunday
Flicks has been compensated.
