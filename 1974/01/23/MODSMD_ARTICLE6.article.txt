# GOP Nomination
## Flournoy Has Edge 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY News Analysis 
Former Deputy Defense Secretary
David Packard's recent endorsement of
Controller Houston Flournoy for
governor caught many observers by
surprise. But the endorsement seems
to indicate that Flournoy is now
clearly the man to beat for the
Republican nomination.
Packard, millionaire chairman of the
board of Hewlett-Packard and a
former Stanford trustee, headed the

local Committee for the Reelection of
the President in 1972 and is one of the
state party's chief conservatives.
Flournoy — a handsome former
college professor concluding his
second term as controller — has
generally been considered a moderate
liberal. What could have brought them
together?
Packard may have supplied the
answer himself in his endorsement:
"I'm convinced that, in the political
climate of 1974, he [Flournoy] has
the best chance of winning ..
"The political climate of 1974" is
what former Vice President Agnew
referred to as "the new post-Watergate
mentality." And that mentality may
have dictated Flournoy as the
candidate with the best chance of
success.
The ranks of Republican
gubernatorial contenders — once as
plentiful as their Democratic
counterparts — have dwindled now to
just two: Flournoy and Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke. And Packard's endorsement
seems to be a message to Reinecke —
and perhaps to other conservative GOP
money men — that the only
Republican who can win this year is
one who is not closely identified with
the established order.
Reinecke is, in the words of Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey, Jr., R-Menlo Park,
"touched by Watergate" through his
questioning in connection with the
ITT scandal. "The touch of the tar
baby is on Ed Reinecke," said
McCloskey.
In addition, the Los Angeles Times
last year uncovered a messy
influence-peddling operation involving
a Reinecke aide. The net effect of
these implications make Reinecke
appear less than simon-pure — and a
potential liability on the ticket.
Ironically, on the same day that
Packard — a Nixon booster — endorsed
Flournoy, McCloskey — one of
Nixon's major opponents — was doing
the same thing.
Of Packard's endorsement,
McCloskey commented, "It proves
that Dave Packard is meeting reality."
Packard himself was mentioned at
one time as a possible GOP candidate.
Other potential contenders who
dropped out, or removed themselves
from consideration, include Nixon's
Health, Education and Welfare
Secretary, Caspar Weinberger; former
HEW Secretary and Lt. Gov. Robert
Finch, who announced Monday that
he would not seek any elective office
this year; and state Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger, who is expected to announce
his candidacy for reelection today.
Finch's decision paves the way for a
battle between at least two other
Republicans for the right to challenge
Democratic U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston
Jr., a Stanford alumnus and Earl G.
Brian, Gov. Reagan's secretary of
Health and Welfare, resigned from the
cabinet last week and is expected to
announce his candidacy shortly. State
Sen. H.L. Richardson of Arcadia has
already announced.
In addition, S.I. Hayakawa. former
president of San Francisco State
University, is asking the State Supreme
Court to overturn a provision of the
state election code requiring a person
to have been registered in a party at
least 12 months before filing for that
party's primary. If Hayakawa is
successful, he, too, will run for the
Senate.
