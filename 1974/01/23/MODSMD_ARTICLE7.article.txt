## Energy Profiteering 
### 
All that can be said with confidence about the "energy crisis" is
that it has spurred a veritable orgy of profiteering by great and small
alike.
Witness the discovery, late last week, that 11 gas stations in Santa
Clara County — our own Campus Shell among them — have been
nabbed for overcharging in violation of price controls.
And the Internal Revenue Service has promised another list of
gasoline gougers by the end of this week.
This shoddy behavior by small-scale operators merely lends greater
consistency to the slowly clearing picture of energy industry
behavior during times of shortage, real or imagined.
We now know, for example, that the only figures available on fuel
reserves are those of the fuel industry itself. And we are discovering
that those figures reflect only what the industry wishes to convey.
Last week, Federal Power Commission chairman John N. Nassikas
reported that natural gas producers have been guilty of "serious
under-reporting" of reserves. And FPC files uncovered last week
disclosed that some natural gas producers have tried to buy up
available reserves, intending to keep gas off the market and await
higher prices.
Oil company profits are higher than ever before — in the case of
one company, up 60 percent over last year. The companies protest
that the profits are needed for capital expenditures. But they cannot
demonstrate convincingly that their reserves are dangerously low —
indeed, there is evidence to indicate that reserves are higher than last
year — or that there is a greater need for capital expenditures this
year than last.
Public utilities, not to be outdone, have entered the act, pointing
to the energy crisis as a new justification for their nuclear power
plants.
It should come as no surprise that the principal concern of the
energy industry, even in time of national emergency, is profit.
Whether the whole discomforting crisis is a sham or not remains to
be seen. But the companies have a long way to go before they can
refute Sen. Abraham Ribicoff's complaint that they are simply
"cheating the American public."
