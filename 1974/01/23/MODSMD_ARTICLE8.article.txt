Since the time when I was sent to
grammar school in 1908 I have spent
most of my time in schools and spent
only a very short period at home
which was located in North China.
My original plan to come to this
country was to do research in radio
engineering. When I first arrived at
Stanford in 1937, I was located in the
department of electrical engineering
and considered it as my home. Dr.
F.E. Terman was my supervisor. I was
very well treated by all the professors
and students. Among my friends, Mr.
W. Brenner, Mr. W. Hewlett, Dr. Ed
Ginztin and Dr. J. Show should be
mentioned.
In 1941 Dr. Terman left for the
east, so I came to the physics
department in 1942. I did my work
in X-rays under Dr. P. Kirkpatrick,
who has always been nice to me.
During the war, both the main
library and the physics department
found it difficult to get people to
work for them. So sometimes I
watched the loan desk in the evening
and graded students' papers for the
physics department. I did these things
as a volunteer. When I saw something
happen on the campus I called the
police department to help the
University.
From 1951 to the present I have
been on the payroll of Stanford
University. My jobs included locking
up the main library at night, checking
the radiation badges for the Hansen
laboratory (1952-1966) and watching
the storeroom for a few hours at night
for the physics department which 1
now consider as my home.
Since 1945 I have spent most of my
time every day in busily reading the
new physics publications and trying to
solve basic physics problems. Although
I have some different ideas on several
important physics problems, I have
not published them.
Even when the communists arrived
at my hometown in 1948, I did not
know exactly what they did to my
home. In 1951 I wrote my
brother-in-law; the communists got my
letter and questioned my wife I did
not think that she was very badly
treated because my letter was just an
open one.

I don't smoke or drink; I don't
watch T.V. and have no radio. I like
classical music, enjoy playing with
children and read history books and
Chinese classics.
I am a follower of Confucius and
admire Benjamin Franklin, Arnold
Sommerfeld and Bertrand Russell who
delivered several series of lectures at
the Peking University in 1920-1921
when I was a student at that institute.
Lastly, I was offered professorship
several times since 1940. As I want to
devote all my time to learn and work
on basic physics problems, I declined
the honor.

The editorial "ROTC: R.1.P."
contains a serious factual error. The
Faculty Senate did not vote to
postpone indefinitely any
consideration of the ROTC issue.
Rather, as President Lyman noted in
Friday's Academic Council meeting,
the Senate voted merely to postpone
the obligation of the steering
committee to gather pertinent
information for the conduct of the
ROTC debate.
Senate Chairman Walecka noted at
the same Academic Council meeting
that the ROTC issue will be brought
before the Senate at the next meeting.
At that time, one of the options the
Senate will vote on will be the
possibility of indefinitely postponing
the entire ROTC discussion.
Professor Holman's question
remains: why in view of strong
sentiment in the Senate against ROTC,
and the vote to postpone information
gathering needed for a realistic
reconsideration is the Senate Steering
committee scheduling ROTC for the
next meeting? A possible theoretical
answer is that the steering committee
is bound by Senate rules to schedule
"expeditiously" a matter supported by
the signature of 52 faculty members.
A more probable answer is that some
faculty members are interested in
ROTC, and that this group can't be
ignored, although they may eventually
be defeated.

the Senate voted merely to postpone
the obligation of the steering

Senate Chairman Walecka noted at

At that time, one of the options the

Professor Holman's question
remains: why in view of strong
sentiment in the Senate against ROTC,
and the vote to postpone information
gathering needed for a realistic
reconsideration is the Senate Steering
committee scheduling ROTC for the
next meeting? A possible theoretical
answer is that the steering committee
is bound by Senate rules to schedule
"expeditiously" a matter supported by
the signature of 52 faculty members.
A more probable answer is that some
faculty members are interested in
ROTC, and that this group can't be
ignored, although they may eventually
be defeated.

Since the time when I was sent to
grammar school in 1908 I have spent
most of my time in schools and spent
only a very short period at home
which was located in North China.
My original plan to come to this
country was to do research in radio
engineering. When I first arrived at
Stanford in 1937, I was located in the
department of electrical engineering
and considered it as my home. Dr.
F.E. Terman was my supervisor. I was
very well treated by all the professors
and students. Among my friends, Mr.
W. Brenner, Mr. W. Hewlett, Dr. Ed
Ginztin and Dr. J. Show should be
mentioned.
In 1941 Dr. Terman left for the
east, so I came to the physics
department in 1942. I did my work
in X-rays under Dr. P. Kirkpatrick,
who has always been nice to me.
During the war, both the main
library and the physics department
found it difficult to get people to
work for them. So sometimes I
watched the loan desk in the evening
and graded students' papers for the
physics department. I did these things
as a volunteer. When I saw something
happen on the campus I called the
police department to help the
University.
From 1951 to the present I have
been on the payroll of Stanford
University. My jobs included locking
up the main library at night, checking
the radiation badges for the Hansen
laboratory (1952-1966) and watching
the storeroom for a few hours at night
for the physics department which 1
now consider as my home.
Since 1945 I have spent most of my
time every day in busily reading the
new physics publications and trying to
solve basic physics problems. Although
I have some different ideas on several
important physics problems, I have
not published them.
Even when the communists arrived
at my hometown in 1948, I did not
know exactly what they did to my
home. In 1951 I wrote my
brother-in-law; the communists got my
letter and questioned my wife I did
