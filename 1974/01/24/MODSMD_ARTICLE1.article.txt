# Adviser-Student Relations: A Two-Way Street
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
"My adviser doesn't know me as a
person."
"He never even recognizes me on
campus."
"I had a really good relationship
with my freshman adviser but then he
left."
"My adviser never seems to be able
to answer my questions about
courses."
These quotes seem to typify
student complaints about the advising
system here. Robert Hamrdla, head of
the Academic Information Center
(AIC), declares: "Advisers are to aid
students in setting and achieving
academic goals. If a student complains
that his adviser doesn't know him as a
person it's a valid complaint only if it
interferes with setting and reaching
these goals."
Hamrdla continued, "Certainly, not
recognizing his advisee on the Quad is
also a valid complaint if the student
has put forth his 50 percent share of
trying to get to know his adviser.
"But complaining that he [the
adviser) doesn't know the secrets of
the student's heart is not."
Critical Report
The Other Stanford, a recent
SWOPSI report on the relationship of
professors and undergraduates, is
highly critical of both the level and
quality of such interaction. One of its
recommendations is that
"undergraduates should take more
advantage of tutorials, independent
study, directed reading, directed
research and office hours" to get to
know their professors better.
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Mason Yearian and other
University administrators and
professors agree that these working
situations can often develop into more
meaningful faculty-student
relationships than those between
adviser and advisee, and that many
times the latter can stem from the

former.
The advising system is officially
under the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies' office and includes the AIC
and the individual advisers in freshman
residences and undergraduate
departments and programs.
Quality Differs
Advising for declared majors is
strictly the responsibility of each
department, many of which have
differing systems and differing quality
levels.
The Engineering Department is
reputed to provide the best advising on
campus. It may be because, as Asst.
Dean Alfred Kirkland puts it, "We like
our students. We realize they have a
tough program, and we do anything
we can do to help them."
Besides this esprit de corps, the
Engineering Department has some
innovative politices regarding advising.
It is probably the only department
with an adviser evaluation form on
which the student can complain to
someone — besides his classmates —
that "my adviser doesn't know me as a
person."
Adviser Associates
Each Engineering Department
freshman adviser has one or two
adviser associates who are juniors,
seniors or first year grad students and
can help advise freshmen, especially on
courses outside the department.
Other Engineering Department
innovations the University has since
adopted include departmental advising
handbooks, and the system of
assigning one advisor to all of the
advisees of a certain house.
The department requires an
adviser's signature on each student's
study list each quarter. Actually,
anyone in the Dean's office can sign
them, according to Kirkland, but it
does give a chance to make sure that
students are enrolled in the proper
math and science sequences, and to
"make sure we see them at least once a

quarter — the opportunity for
student-adviser interaction is there,"
he said.
Yet, standing in a line recently at
the AIC was a senior engineering
student who wanted to have his
distribution requirements for
graduation checked. To his surprise, he
was two units short in Humanities.
20 'Holds'
"Out of approximately 1400
candidates for graduation, we usually
have to hold about 20 for some
reason," said Hamrdla. "The
requirements are well publicized. We'll
give a good answer to a student who
comes in to have his courses evaluated,
but my question is, do we owe a
student anything who won't even take

the initiative?
"At present, it is impossible to run
a computer check on every senior's
record to see if he is qualified to
graduate or not. We have to do it
manually when we receive a list of
degree candidates, but that is usually
two weeks before the end of their final
quarter.
"Hopefully, with a new system, we
will be able to do it. But should we
have to?" Hamrdla asked. "I think
society coddles University students
too much as it is."
Walk Right In
The program in Human Biology has
eight paid student advisers who are
available in the department at all hours
of the day on a walk-in basis.

"Because it is an interdepartmental
program and not a department, all of
the faculty are highly specialized in
and borrowed from their own
departments," according to program
coordinator Dr. Sophia Alway, and
would not even make very good
academic advisers except in their own
field.
She feels that the student advisers
provide good degree and course
information. Beyond that, students are
encouraged to take advantage of
faculty office hours to talk to
professors in their particular area of
interest.
"Students are better sources of
information about course content and
what a professor is like because

they've actually taken the classes,"
Alway said.
As far as improving the system,
Dean Yearian feels that perhaps new
advisers can be better trained. "The
freshmen advising program is
structured about as well as it ever will
be with volunteers," he said.
Yearian called any system of
financial rewards for the many faculty
involved "extremely prohibitive."
Individual advisers can be changed
by the resident fellow in a freshman's
dorm, by the AIC for undeclared
sophomores, and by the department
office or advising coordinator for
declared majors.
