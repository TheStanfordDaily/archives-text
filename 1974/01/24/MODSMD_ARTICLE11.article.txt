# Three Convicted, Part II
## Questionable Testimony By Ronald Beaty 
### 
*Mick Goldstein

(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion
of a two-part series. To summarize: On Dec. 21,
1973, a two-week federal trial concluded with a
Phoenix jury convicting Goldstein and two others of
four felonies: conspiracy, harboring an escaped
federal prisoner (Ronald Wayne Beaty), aidfhg him
in eluding capture, and concealing his escape from
authorities.) \ i
Aspects of the escapee's story suggest that he
[Ronald W. Beaty] may also be eager to get Mr.
Bruce Franklin because the latter refused to help him
after the escape. We proved in our trial that Bruce
Franklin was giving a speech in San Diego when
Beaty placed him at a crucial meeting 500 miles
away in Palo Alto. Beaty admits that he lied to
make his story more credible when he said Bruce
Franklin ordered him blindfolded when others took
him to his first hiding place, an "order" he had
described in detail. And he lied when he said Mr.
Franklin and I arranged for Lori and Harry Bishara
to harbor him.
Beaty's testimony was the necessary outcome of
the story he told authorities a year ago, when he
was captured and desperately seeking a way to avoid
life in prison. He gave them what they wanted: a
claim that Bruce Franklin had arranged his escape
and his stays in the Bay Area and on the
Reservation. The Arizona story was most credible if
his hosts and someone from the Bay Area (me) were
knowing participants in the scheme. Still, the story
has its ridiculous aspects, beyond the fundamental
claim that we would risk our lives and careers for
him.
Alleged Link
Beaty stated that I was to be his contact with
people on the West Coast, but his narrative also
refers to a total of three more direct channels for
reaching those who allegedly helped him escape. He
said that we were strangers to him, but that he made
a point of telling us that he was not who he claimed
to be. He testified that he expected the Bishara
house to be "safe" because it was a "revolutionary
house," but that he left because he found it unsafe

for the same reason: a "Commie house" would be
conspicuous in the community. (The Bisharas are
not communists.)
He said I warned him of a ten-agent FBI office in
the area and of a recent trumped-up drug raid on
the house, but other testimony showed there was no
office and no raid. He said he warned Lori that
there would be a shoot-out if police came for him.
Her alleged response to this shocking news: "She
said that it didn't make any difference .. ~ that
they had some house defense training and weapons
of their own and stuff and they weren't worried
about it." Beaty offered no reason why the Bisharas
would be unconcerned about laying down their lives
for him.
The trial judge was as amazed at the jurors'
verdict as we were. No one knows what their
prejudices were: the procedures had not permitted
questioning prospective jurors in a manner that
would expose their biases in advance. We were
clearly identified as sympathetic to Indian causes
and as having Indian friends, facts which could
certainly affect a jury's determination of who we
were, in light of the racism of the area.
Irrelevant References
Moreover, the prosecutor made repeated
references to radical political posters and books in
the Bisharas' house, to weapons they owned legally,
and even to our appearance at the time of our
arrests. (Harry and I both had longer hair; I had a
beard.) Finally, the jury was given the Venceremos
newspaper Beaty left at the house, a highly
prejudicial document lauding the escape as a
revolutionary act.
These tactics must have triggered
well-conditioned ways of evaluating those whom the
government chooses to label subversive, and these
responses are still strong in conservative Phoenix. In
order to convict, the jury had to disregard our own
testimony, evidence presented by some witnesses
called by the prosecution and others called by us,
serious attacks on Beaty's credibility, and even the
judge's instructions on a legal element which was

missing from the prosecution's case. Only the jurors'
biases against defendants in general, and those
whose political beliefs were alluded to the way ours
were in particular, could erect such an unrebuttable
presumption of guilt.
The government's approach to the case was
expected. The decision to prosecute was not based
on any belief on the part of the local U.S. attorney
(prosecutor) that he had a good case. He had
prosecuted Beaty two years ago on the kidnap
charge and knew he had a perjuror for his star
witness this time.
Guilty Plea Requested
The orders to prosecute came from Guy
Goodwin, the Justice Department's red-hunting
chief of "Internal Security" and a key part of the
Administration's 1970 domestic counter-insurgency
plan. Goodwin wanted us to plead guilty to an
innocuous-sounding misdemeanor, but dismissal of
the felonies and leniency in sentencing would have
been contingent on how "cooperative" we were
with the FBI, a grand jury, and prosecutors at
others' trials.
Being "cooperative" and reaping the benefits
available to one who turn's state's evidence clearly
would have meant supporting The Truth as
Established by Ronald Wayne Beaty. Internal
Security was hardly going to dismiss four felony
charges and give us favorable sentencing
recommendations if we told the truth â€” that we
knew nothing that would support prosecutions of
Bruce Franklin or anyone else. Since we were not
prepared to plead guilty or to perjure ourselves to
please the Justice Department, the "deal" was not
much of an offer. So the case went to trial.
We are presently free on bail. Motions for a
judgment of acquittal and for a new trial will be
argued Jan. 28, the day set for sentencing. If the
judge upholds the verdict, we will appeal.
