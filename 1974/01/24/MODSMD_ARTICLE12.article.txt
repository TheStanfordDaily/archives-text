# Numerous Contradictions
## Discontinue Overseas Campus Program 
### 
-. Mark Weaver

Ask anyone who has been to one of the Stanford
overseas campuses what he thought of the
experience and he will most likely reply, "It was a
lot of fun. I took a bunch of mick courses and did a
lot of traveling."
With an economic crunch descending on the
university and tuition ascending to ob&ene levels it
seems necessary for the Stanford community to
reassess the overseas campus program, one which
costs over $1.5 million annually. Moreover, the
value of this program should be of particular
interest to parents who pay upwards of $5,000 for
their sons and daughters to attend. Careful
examination shows that we are paying more for
six-month European vacations than for valid
intellectual and cultural learning experiences and
that the present program should be abolished.
The purpose of the overseas campuses is to
provide students with a challenging academic
program in an environment where they profit from
exposure to a foreign culture. Things however do
not work out this way. Students do not interact
with their environment, nor do they undertake
serious study because the program incorporates
three contradictions which nullify the fulfillment of
these purposes.
The first contradiction is between the need to
study and the desire to travel while at an overseas
campus. Each works against the other and in the
end cancel each other out. Classes are held only four
days a week and professors must lessen their course
work load to accomodate student travel schedules.
The whole environment at an overseas campus
works against serious study. How can one really
study when Vienna is outside the door and
Switzerland a few hours away? For this kind of
curriculum, which virtually everyone agrees is
markedly inferior to the home campus, Stanford
students pay the standard tuition.
The second contradiction is between the

clustering together of students in their chalet or
estate, away from the local culture and the fact of
human nature that individuals tend to form bonds
with members of their own culture unless they are
in a situation where this is not feasible. As a result,
students do little interacting with their immediate
environment. Social life revolves around the
American ghetto and except for rare instances
excludes the local people. Simply because they are
living together with minimal language skills,
students turn to each other out of convenience
rather than make the effort to seek out the local
life. Even where family programs exist they seldom
evolve into anything more than a token visit each
week by a student to his family. The attraction to
one's American colleagues is too great to resist.
Isolation
Even the organized field trips structure isolation
rather than integration into the overseas experience.
Students are herded onto buses for sight-seeing
tours like a group of senior citizens when their
youth, vigor, and curiosity should prompt them to
investigate the experience for themselves. Even
worse, they are put up in first class hotels and fed
fancy, yet unpalatable, Americanized hotel fare.
Personally, I learned much more while on my
own for four days in Poland than I did in ten on the
group field trip to Romania. I felt much more a part
of Polish culture slopping noodle soup in a crowded
Warsaw milk bar than I did chewing veal cutlets in a
first class Bucharest hotel dining room. It cost
Stanford much less also.
A third contradiction involves a conflict within
the purposes of the program themselves. On one
hand, students are encouraged (by the four-day class
week) to do extensive weekend traveling. On the
other hand they are expected to spend some time
becoming familiar with the local culture. In the end
students end up spending a good part of the week
doing their booking so they can travel far and wide
on the weekend. All of this is at the expense of

exploring their immediate surroundings.
It is these contradictions which effectively
nullify the program's value. Let me suggest a way to
resolve them. If students want to travel they should
go to Europe on their own. If they want to study in
a foreign environment they should have the option
of a modified overseas campus program open to
them. The ideal program would place a student in a
foreign university, help him coordinate his work,
and receive Stanford credit for it. It would place
him within the local university housing system or in
a private home where he would realize the genuine
experience of living in a foreign country.
Most of all such a program would provide the
student with the language skills necessary to allow
him to function in that situation. The present
program in Salamanca and proposed programs in
Berlin, Vienna, and Lima are a step in the right
direction and would not involve the costly
expenditures generated by the existence of formal
American campuses. These deserve subsidization.
With regard to the present program our money can
be best spent elsewhere.

reassess the overseas campus program, one which
costs over $1.5 million annually. Moreover, the
value of this program should be of particular
interest to parents who pay upwards of $5,000 for
their sons and daughters to attend. Careful
examination shows that we are paying more for
six-month European vacations than for valid
intellectual and cultural learning experiences and
that the present program should be abolished.
The purpose of the overseas campuses is to
provide students with a challenging academic
program in an environment where they profit from
exposure to a foreign culture. Things however do
not work out this way. Students do not interact
with their environment, nor do they undertake
serious study because the program incorporates
three contradictions which nullify the fulfillment of
these purposes.
The first contradiction is between the need to
study and the desire to travel while at an overseas
campus. Each works against the other and in the
end cancel each other out. Classes are held only four
days a week and professors must lessen their course
work load to accomodate student travel schedules.
The whole environment at an overseas campus
works against serious study. How can one really
study when Vienna is outside the door and
Switzerland a few hours away? For this kind of
curriculum, which virtually everyone agrees is
markedly inferior to the home campus, Stanford
students pay the standard tuition.
The second contradiction is between the

clustering together of students in their chalet or
estate, away from the local culture and the fact of
human nature that individuals tend to form bonds
with members of their own culture unless they are
in a situation where this is not feasible. As a result,
students do little interacting with their immediate
environment. Social life revolves around the
American ghetto and except for rare instances
excludes the local people. Simply because they are
living together with minimal language skills,
students turn to each other out of convenience
rather than make the effort to seek out the local
life. Even where family programs exist they seldom
evolve into anything more than a token visit each
week by a student to his family. The attraction to
one's American colleagues is too great to resist.
Isolation
Even the organized field trips structure isolation
rather than integration into the overseas experience.
Students are herded onto buses for sight-seeing
tours like a group of senior citizens when their
youth, vigor, and curiosity should prompt them to
investigate the experience for themselves. Even
worse, they are put up in first class hotels and fed
fancy, yet unpalatable, Americanized hotel fare.
Personally, I learned much more while on my
own for four days in Poland than I did in ten on the
group field trip to Romania. I felt much more a part
of Polish culture slopping noodle soup in a crowded
Warsaw milk bar than I did chewing veal cutlets in a
first class Bucharest hotel dining room. It cost
Stanford much less also.
A third contradiction involves a conflict within
the purposes of the program themselves. On one
hand, students are encouraged (by the four-day class
week) to do extensive weekend traveling. On the
other hand they are expected to spend some time
becoming familiar with the local culture. In the end
students end up spending a good part of the week
doing their booking so they can travel far and wide
on the weekend. All of this is at the expense of

exploring their immediate surroundings.
It is these contradictions which effectively
nullify the program's value. Let me suggest a way to
resolve them. If students want to travel they should
go to Europe on their own. If they want to study in
a foreign environment they should have the option
of a modified overseas campus program open to
them. The ideal program would place a student in a
foreign university, help him coordinate his work,
and receive Stanford credit for it. It would place
him within the local university housing system or in
a private home where he would realize the genuine
experience of living in a foreign country.
Most of all such a program would provide the
student with the language skills necessary to allow
him to function in that situation. The present
program in Salamanca and proposed programs in
Berlin, Vienna, and Lima are a step in the right
direction and would not involve the costly
expenditures generated by the existence of formal
American campuses. These deserve subsidization.
With regard to the present program our money can
be best spent elsewhere.

that the present program should be abolished.
The purpose of the overseas campuses is to
provide students with a challenging academic
program in an environment where they profit from
exposure to a foreign culture. Things however do
not work out this way. Students do not interact
with their environment, nor do they undertake
serious study because the program incorporates
three contradictions which nullify the fulfillment of
these purposes.
The first contradiction is between the need to
study and the desire to travel while at an overseas
campus. Each works against the other and in the
end cancel each other out. Classes are held only four
days a week and professors must lessen their course
work load to accomodate student travel schedules.
The whole environment at an overseas campus
works against serious study. How can one really
study when Vienna is outside the door and
Switzerland a few hours away? For this kind of
curriculum, which virtually everyone agrees is
markedly inferior to the home campus, Stanford
students pay the standard tuition.
The second contradiction is between the

clustering together of students in their chalet or
estate, away from the local culture and the fact of
human nature that individuals tend to form bonds
with members of their own culture unless they are
in a situation where this is not feasible. As a result,
students do little interacting with their immediate
environment. Social life revolves around the
American ghetto and except for rare instances
excludes the local people. Simply because they are
living together with minimal language skills,
students turn to each other out of convenience
rather than make the effort to seek out the local
life. Even where family programs exist they seldom
evolve into anything more than a token visit each
week by a student to his family. The attraction to
one's American colleagues is too great to resist.
Isolation
Even the organized field trips structure isolation
rather than integration into the overseas experience.
Students are herded onto buses for sight-seeing
tours like a group of senior citizens when their
youth, vigor, and curiosity should prompt them to
investigate the experience for themselves. Even
worse, they are put up in first class hotels and fed
fancy, yet unpalatable, Americanized hotel fare.
Personally, I learned much more while on my
own for four days in Poland than I did in ten on the
group field trip to Romania. I felt much more a part
of Polish culture slopping noodle soup in a crowded
Warsaw milk bar than I did chewing veal cutlets in a
first class Bucharest hotel dining room. It cost
Stanford much less also.
A third contradiction involves a conflict within
the purposes of the program themselves. On one
hand, students are encouraged (by the four-day class
week) to do extensive weekend traveling. On the
other hand they are expected to spend some time
becoming familiar with the local culture. In the end
students end up spending a good part of the week
doing their booking so they can travel far and wide
on the weekend. All of this is at the expense of

exploring their immediate surroundings.
It is these contradictions which effectively
nullify the program's value. Let me suggest a way to
resolve them. If students want to travel they should
go to Europe on their own. If they want to study in
a foreign environment they should have the option
of a modified overseas campus program open to
them. The ideal program would place a student in a
foreign university, help him coordinate his work,
and receive Stanford credit for it. It would place
him within the local university housing system or in
a private home where he would realize the genuine
experience of living in a foreign country.
Most of all such a program would provide the
student with the language skills necessary to allow
him to function in that situation. The present
program in Salamanca and proposed programs in
Berlin, Vienna, and Lima are a step in the right
direction and would not involve the costly
expenditures generated by the existence of formal
American campuses. These deserve subsidization.
With regard to the present program our money can
be best spent elsewhere.
