# ACT's 'Miser' Lacks 'Sparkle'
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
IT he American Conservatory Theatre is
presenting in repertoire Moliere's The Miser
(L'Avare) as its offering in French classical
theatre. The Bay Area is blessed to have a
fine repertoire company bringing it the best
in World dramatic literature. Unfortunately,
in this specific instance something was lost in
the translation, both in script and
production.
The Miser is one of Moliere's comedy
masterworks, though it is more grim in its
statement and a bit less witty than his others
of this genre. Its blunt theme is the evil of
avarice, an avarice which causes the title
character to shed even the vaguest remnants
of dignity, to strip him of all paternal
affection, and to come between his children
and their lovers. Moliere employs a variety of
personae which approach caricatures in
pursuit of his point.
Persuasive Performance
The persuasive performance of such
caricatures requires, paradoxically, extreme
subtlety. Such subtlety is born of years of
experience in the genre, as exemplified in the
Co me die- Fra ncaise.
This national institution of France, at
once the glory and despair of the French
iheatre, restricts itself with only the rarest of
exceptions, to classical French comedy.
The rigidly hierarchical nature of its cast
ind the years that go toward achieving the
eading roles make for the flawless, if
extremely conventional, playing of Moliere.
ndeed it is just that convention that is

required for successful Moliere.
The Comedie-Francaise actors work their
way up from walk-on role to supporting
actor to lead, from the status of pensionnaire
to societaire (permanent member of the
company) only after years in the ranks. In
that time they learn all the nuances, the
tricks of the trade that enhance the wit of
their playwrights.
Upon achieving the status of lead, the
same dozen roles are repeated year after year,
a horror perhaps to the American or English
actor but a tradition which achieves a
uniformly splendid production of each and
every French comic classic.
Lacking Ease
Subtlety and familiarity and ease with
convention are precisely what A.C.T.'s
performance of The Miser lacked. Director
Allen Fletcher's cast vacillated from an
uneasy Stanislavskian realism, as in certain
poignant moments of Ray Reinhardt's
Harpagon (the miser), to a flippant farce of
match-stick figures, particularly Claire Malis'
Elise, who seemed disappointingly redundant
in the similarity to her performance in
Taming of the Shew.
It was altogether too obvious that in this
instance A.C.T. was unable to find a viable
shortcut to the laborious French process of
producing Moliere.
More importantly, Fletcher did not offer a
cogent alternative. The nineteenth century
setting did complement the melodramatic
aspects of the last act, and reinforced
successfully the theme of materialistic greed,

but it did not camouflage the inconsistency
of the acting styles.
The vast majority of the cast seemed
unsure of what Moliere expected of them.
Such lack of clarity can only hurt a
performance of Moliere.
Encouraging Exceptions
There were encouraging exceptions. James
Winker's Valere, a gentleman in the guise of a
steward, painted with bold, broad, sparkling
brush strokes those moments of cliche which
the playwright requires; his unabashed
lucidity was in striking contrast with the
uneasy, almost embarrassed attitude of some
of the cast.
Charles Lanyer's Cleante, the miser's son,
was particularly lacklustre in this regard. Yet
Winker revealed a real character beneath the
satirist's caricature in a moment of anger in
beating the cook-horseman.
It is precisely this dual-capacity which is
necessary to successful Moliere: a
combination of the social satirist's caricature
and the playwright's verisimilitude. Ronald
Bousson's La Fleche was refreshing as a
roguish, devious, Dickensian valet and
provided the necessary balance of lightness.
A.C.T.'s Miser should be seen, for
encounters with Moliere are essential to the
experience of the enlightened theatregoer.
The A.C.T. production is competent, but
competence for Moliere is insufficient; there
must be sparkle. It is both a credit to and the
burden of the company that a merely
competent performance is disappointing. We
have come to expect more from A.C.T.


ALMElDA â€” Brazilian guitarist Laurindo Almeida opened the "Jazzboree" show last Saturday at the
Paramount Theater in Oakland. Although Almeida was good, Benny Carter outperformed even the
greatest of the other jazz greats in attendance.
