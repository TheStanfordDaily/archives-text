# Saxophonist Benny Carter Steals His Own Show
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Saxophonist Benny Carter
stole his own show at last
Saturday's "Jazzboree" at
Oakland's Paramount Theater.
Billed as a salute to Carter, the
show included Herbie Mann and
The Family of Mann, the
Laurindo Almeida Quartet, and a
rare appearance by the Benny
Carter Sextet.
Brazilian guitarist Almeida
apened the show alone, to be
ioined later by perhaps the
greatest jazz bassist of all, Ray
Brown, and then drummer Chuck
Flores.
For the first few selections,
\lmeida played classical pieces
;potlighting his fine unamplified
juitar work. With alto
•axophonist Bud Shank joining
hem, the quartet switched to

bossa nova, beginning with
"Tocata."
Shank, a veteran of the Stan
Kenton Orchestra (as is Almeida),
showed that he is equally
outstanding on flute or alto. The
quartet closed with a beautiful

Entertainment

arrangment of Antonio Carlos
Jobim's "One Note Samba."
Benny Carter is the type of
musician who deserves a standing
ovation just for walking onto the
stage, an event that has become all
too infrequent in recent years.

But, he by no means stopped
there; he proved once again that
he is without a doubt one of the
giants of jazz.
Carter's sextet included Paul
Humphrey on drums, Gildo
Mahones on piano, Larry Gales on

bass, formerly of Thelonius
Monk's group, and the great Harry
"Sweets" Edison on trumpet,
from the Count Basie Band of the
30s.
The group handled a wide

range of jazz styles, from swing to
modern, beginning with
"Undecided" and Dizzy
Gillespie's "Might In Tunisia."
The rhythm section was featured
alone on "Aiuumn Leaves," with
a nice bowedlsolo by Gales, and
some very impressive work from
Mahones.
The band'§ sixth member was
vocalist Clea Bradford, who was
slightly too Ipw-key on "Here's
That Rainy Day"and "I Got
Rhythm." Carter's beautiful alto
was spotlightefl on "The Nearness
of You." M
Special Award
Following the band's last
number, Duke Ellington's "Take
The 'A' Train," a special award
was presented to Carter by Jimmy
Lyons, producer of the Monterey
Jazz Festival.
Master of ceremonies Leonard
Feather, noted jazz critic,
introduced Herbie Mann by saying
that "any good music is beyond
categorization." What followed
was a rather disappointing set
made up mostly of rock tunes,
like the Rolling Stones' "Bitch."
Mann for years monopolized
jazz polls as the number one
flautist, until being knocked down
to second place in last year's
Downbeat poll by Hubert Laws.
The current line-up of The
Family of Mann is fairly shabby,

except for saxophonist David
"Fathead" Newman, a veteran of
the Ray Charles Orchestra.
Unfortunately, he was featured on
only one number, "The Night

Time Is The Right Time."
The group saved their best
number for last, "Memphis
Underground," with both Mann
and Newman in a flute duet.
