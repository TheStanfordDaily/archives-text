# A 						Surprise At Winterland
## 
### ROD KOON 
Last Friday night at
Vinterland, Dave Mason and
Janned Heat were scheduled to
ippear, but as so often happens,
he friendly announcer came on
tage and said, "We regret to
nform you that'.. (And you
ry to fill in the rest: "Dave
dason swallowed a guitar pick
ind won't be able to sing?" or
'The energy crisis has even wiped
jut Canned Heat?") . . . "due to
in accident, Canned Heat will not
ippear tonight. Instead, we have
or your enjoyment ... (You
magine the worst: The Monkees,
lary and the Hornets? Sky Saxon
ind the Seeds?) .. . "will you
velcome please, Livingston
Taylor!"(ltwas a pleasant surprise
or the crowd.
Livingston (as in Jonathan
Jvingston Seagull) Taylor (as in
lames' brother) came on stage
vith a casual air about him. He'd
ust flown in from Chicago (a last
ninute gig, you know) lost his
guitars, managed to borrow one
vhich he liked so well he thought
le might keep, and had to use a
>encil and rubber band to provide
lim with a makeshift capo. He
vas downhome all the way.
That Taylor Sound
His voice is not unlike brother
lames', though Livingston can get
i little more depth and power
orm his. Starting out on guitar,
ind backed by Bill Elliot on piano
md Walter Robinson on bass,
Taylor performed a number of
ine, gentle folk songs about
vomen, love, and Carolina days.
Two numbers which were
nstantly applauded by the
eceptive crowd were "A Little
lelp from My Friends" backed by
lively piano, and his current hit,
Over the Rainbow." Shifting
iter to banjo picking, he
•erformed some real country
nusic. In one ditty he sang the
•raises of "cornbread and
•uttermilk, a country boy's
lelight . .. they make me what I
m today."
After being called back for an
ncore, Taylor assembled his flute
nd played a jazzy
onglomeration of "The Walls of
ericho" (or "The Sugar Crisp
ong" if you prefer) and
Greensleeves." The crowd truly
njoyed his performance, and one
an't help but hope he develops a
lore unique style, perhaps
mphasizing banjo or flute, which
fould be more distinguishable
rom the sound of his famous
•rother.
The transition of styles
>etween Taylor and Dave Mason
/as easily made when Mason
tarted his set alone, singing and
•laying twelve string guitar. Aside
rom old cuts from his Alone
\)gcther album, he played "Every
Voman," a fine cut from his

newest album.
Following the acoustic set,
which seemed too short, he
switched to electric guitar and his
rock backup group for the rest of
the night. With them he
performed other cuts from his
new album, including "Baby
Please," and the title song "It's
Like You Never Left."
All the songs were
well-performed, and a strong blues
vocal and keyboard selection from
Mason's organist, along with a
spirited version of "Only You
Know and I Know" (a song
written by Mason and made
famous by Delaney and Bonnie)
and a neo-Hendrix rendition of
"All Along the Watchtower"
prevented the concert from
dragging and kept the crowd alive.
Encore
But it was not until his encore
that he performed what is
probably his best-known
songwriting effort, "Feelin' All
Right," which echoed the
sentiments of the crowd at the
time. The roar of the crowd
continued and votive flames
sprinkled the dark auditorium as
he started his second encore.

Prior to Taylor and Mason, an
introductory act called Dalton
and Dußarri performed. And
unlike most first acts, they were
actually good, and the crowd
really responded to their music.
But when the first act comes back
for an encore, you know it's going
to be a long evening. And it was.
But it was also most enjoyable.

Like You Never Left."
All the songs were
well-performed, and a strong blues
vocal and keyboard selection from
Mason's organist, along with a
spirited version of "Only You
Know and I Know" (a song
written by Mason and made
famous by Delaney and Bonnie)
and a neo-Hendrix rendition of
"All Along the Watchtower"
prevented the concert from
dragging and kept the crowd alive.
Encore
But it was not until his encore
that he performed what is
probably his best-known
songwriting effort, "Feelin' All
Right," which echoed the
sentiments of the crowd at the
time. The roar of the crowd
continued and votive flames
sprinkled the dark auditorium as
he started his second encore.

Prior to Taylor and Mason, an
introductory act called Dalton
and Dußarri performed. And
unlike most first acts, they were
actually good, and the crowd
really responded to their music.
But when the first act comes back
for an encore, you know it's going
to be a long evening. And it was.
But it was also most enjoyable.
Last Friday night at
Vinterland, Dave Mason and
Janned Heat were scheduled to
ippear, but as so often happens,
he friendly announcer came on
tage and said, "We regret to
nform you that'.. (And you
ry to fill in the rest: "Dave
dason swallowed a guitar pick
ind won't be able to sing?" or
'The energy crisis has even wiped
jut Canned Heat?") . . . "due to
in accident, Canned Heat will not
ippear tonight. Instead, we have
or your enjoyment ... (You
magine the worst: The Monkees,
lary and the Hornets? Sky Saxon

velcome please, Livingston
Taylor!"(ltwas a pleasant surprise
or the crowd.
Livingston (as in Jonathan
Jvingston Seagull) Taylor (as in
lames' brother) came on stage
vith a casual air about him. He'd
ust flown in from Chicago (a last
ninute gig, you know) lost his
guitars, managed to borrow one
vhich he liked so well he thought
le might keep, and had to use a
>encil and rubber band to provide
lim with a makeshift capo. He
vas downhome all the way.
That Taylor Sound
His voice is not unlike brother
lames', though Livingston can get
i little more depth and power
orm his. Starting out on guitar,
ind backed by Bill Elliot on piano
md Walter Robinson on bass,
Taylor performed a number of
ine, gentle folk songs about
vomen, love, and Carolina days.
Two numbers which were
nstantly applauded by the
eceptive crowd were "A Little
lelp from My Friends" backed by
lively piano, and his current hit,
Over the Rainbow." Shifting
iter to banjo picking, he
•erformed some real country
nusic. In one ditty he sang the
•raises of "cornbread and
•uttermilk, a country boy's
lelight . .. they make me what I
m today."
After being called back for an
ncore, Taylor assembled his flute
nd played a jazzy
onglomeration of "The Walls of
ericho" (or "The Sugar Crisp
ong" if you prefer) and
Greensleeves." The crowd truly
njoyed his performance, and one
an't help but hope he develops a
lore unique style, perhaps
mphasizing banjo or flute, which
fould be more distinguishable
rom the sound of his famous
•rother.
The transition of styles
>etween Taylor and Dave Mason
/as easily made when Mason
tarted his set alone, singing and
•laying twelve string guitar. Aside
rom old cuts from his Alone
\)gcther album, he played "Every
Voman," a fine cut from his

newest album.
Following the acoustic set,
which seemed too short, he
switched to electric guitar and his
rock backup group for the rest of
the night. With them he
performed other cuts from his
new album, including "Baby
Please," and the title song "It's
Like You Never Left."
All the songs were
