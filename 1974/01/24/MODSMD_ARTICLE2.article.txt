# Pub Board To Debate Fund Disbursement
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
In what could turn out to be a
bitter battle over funds that could
mean life or death for some
publications, the ASSU Publications
Board meets today to consider the
recommendations of its funding review
committee.
The committee Monday
recommended the disbursement of
$3000 to eight existing and planned
publications. But the five-member
panel was split in as many ways on the
question of how to spend $1500
allotted for a regular publication of
general interest. Two publications —
Chaparral and Live Oak — have
requested the funds, and the Pub

Board is expected to decide between
them, or compromise, at today's 4:15
p.m. meeting in Tresidder 267-8.
Chaparral publisher Mark Lee
emphasizes that the proposal he put
before the committee is "for a
monthly publication ... with a
magazine format."
The prospectus for Live Oak,
submitted by Editor Bill Weinstein,
outlines plans for an eight to 16-page
weekly tabloid newspaper,
independent of any existing
publication.
The five members of the committee
— ASSU Financial Manager Dave
Martin, Quad Business Manager Kevin
McDermott, Money Book Business
Manager Jim Baer, ASSU Vice
President Charles Ogletree and Daily
Editor Jim Wascher — offered
completely different solutions.
Before the 16 Pub Board members
begin discussing this issue, the
committee's main proposals must be
acted upon. The proposal recommends
grants of:
— $1000 to the Black Student
Union newspaper The Real News.
— $500 to both On One Foot, the
Hillel Foundation quarterly, and to
the proposed quarterly Masks: The
Stanford Journal of Politics, the Arts
and Technology, should this
publication actually become reality.
— $250 to The Stanford Review
and to Sequoia.
— $200 to Min, the Asian Students
Coordinating Committee newsletter.
— $150 to both the Chinese
Student Association newsletter and to
a proposed Gay People's Union
newsletter.
In addition to these grants, the
panel recommended a $500 loan to
the ASSU Restaurant Guide.
