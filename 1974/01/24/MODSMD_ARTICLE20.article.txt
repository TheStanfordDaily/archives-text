Israelis Begin Suez Withdrawal
Israeli tanks and troops began withdrawing from the
west bank of Egypt's Suez Canal yesterday. Jordan and
Syria were reported pursuing their own military
disengagement agreements with Israel.
Israel permitted Egyptian medical teams through Israeli
lines on the west side of the canal to evacuate 300 wounded
Egyptian troops, trapped in the city of Suez since last
October's Arab-Israeli war, the Israeli state radio said. The
Israelis began pulling equipment off the west side of the
canal two days ahead of schedule.
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt told newsmen in Rabat,
Morocco, that he has "noted among the Syrians a readiness
to agree to such disengagement." He declined to elaborate,
but said a Syrian-Israeli agreement similar to last week's
accord to separate the Egyptian and Israeli armies was the
next essential step on the road to peace.
Morton Signs Pipeline Permit
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B.
Morton yesterday signed the long-awaited permit for a
789-mile, $5 billion pipeline to tap the rich oil fields of
Alaska's North Slope.
Construction is expected to start this spring.
"With a little cooperation from the weather man, I am
optimistic that the oil of the North Slope will reach
markets in the lower 48 states by 1977," Morton said.
Officials of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which will
build and operate the line, handed Morton a check for
$12.15 million to pay for environmental studies in
connection with construction.
The pipeline will run from the oil deposits of the
Prudhoe Bay area on the Arctic Ocean to tanker
connections at the ice-free Port of Valdez on Prince William
Sound.
A permit must still be issued by the state of Alaska.
Issuance of the federal permit was delayed by court
action by environmental groups which stretched over three
years.
Congress last year passed legislation designed to clear
away legal obstacles to construction of the pipeline, the
largest such project ever undertaken by private industry.
Dean To Testify Against Chapin
WASHINGTON — Special prosecutor Leon Jaworski said
yesterday that John W. Dean 111 will be "a major
government witness" in a Watergate case against a former
White House aide.
Meanwhile, Senate Republican leader Hugh Scott
>peated his assertion that he has seen evidence that Dean
to the Senate Watergate committee.
Scott disputed a report that the White House tapes do
at contradict Dean's testimony. Dean, former White
ouse counsel, told the Watergate committee that President
ixon knew of the Watergate cover-up before last March
I, the date Nixon said he was told about it.
Jaworski's staff filed a memorandum in federal court
ying that "the government plans to call John W. Dean 111
a witness," at the trial of charges against former
residential appointments secretary Dwight L. Chapin.
Chapin was indicted last Nov. 29, on four counts of
ing to a grand jury about the activities of Donald H.

Segretti, who worked as an underground political agent for
President Nixon's re-election campaign committee in 1972.
Chapin pleaded innocent to the charges. His attorneys
indicated they planned to attempt to bar Dean's testimony
on the grounds he and Chapin had an attorney-client
relationship when Dean was White House counsel.
The memorandum, signed by Jaworski, said that in his
White House job, Dean's primary "client" was the United
States and the office of the President "not the subordinate
employees and officials employed at the White House."
Scott had told reporters he knew of grounds for "several
indictments against Mr. Dean" for perjury.
Scott said the material he has seen indicated that Dean
"testified as to matters that did not occur on the dates and
times he said they occurred."
More British Miners May Strike
LONDON — Yorkshire coal miners agreed yesterday to
press for a national strike that could cut back electricity
enough by spring to threaten a halt in British industry.
The strike call from Barnsley in Yorkshire represented
the views of 65,000 miners who work coal fields in that
northern England region.
It was the first time in the 11-week pay dispute between
coal miners and the government that a union branch had
officially demanded a strike.
The executive of the National Union of Mineworkers,
which represents 270,000 men throughout Britain, meets in
London today to consider whether to call a membership
vote on the strike call. Demands for the vote are expected
to be overwhelming.
Joe Gormley, the union president, has estimated that 70
percent of the 280,000 miners favor a strike, 15 percent
more than needed to vote a walkout.
The union's current overtime ban has cut coal
production by a third, touching off what Prime Minister
Edward Heath has called Britain's gravest economic crisis
since World War 11.
Heath put the nation on a three-day work week to
conserve energy. Seventy percent of Britain's electricity
comes from coal. An all-out strike could completely cut off
coal supplies by spring, forcing an industrial shutdown.
Younger Seeks Re-election
LOS ANGELES — Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger said
yesterday he would run for re-election rather than seek the
Republican gubernatorial nomination.
"My decision is based not so much on the difficulty
involved in running for governor but more on the feeling of
pride on what I have accomplished in the attorney general's
office in the last three years and the conviction that I can
accomplish even more in the next three years," he told a
news conference.
He said statistics released last week by the Bureau of
Criminal Statistics indicate that "for the first time in 13
years, the crime rate in California is going to be down."
Younger, 55, said the Watergate scandal also influenced
his decision, since it has discouraged many Republican
financial contributors. He said a gubernatorial campaign
could conceivably cost $4.5 million.
"I find the prospect of seeking such large contributions
distasteful, and frankly I don't know if I could be
successful if I tried," he said.

yesterday that John W. Dean 111 will be "a major
government witness" in a Watergate case against a former
White House aide.
Meanwhile, Senate Republican leader Hugh Scott
>peated his assertion that he has seen evidence that Dean
to the Senate Watergate committee.
Scott disputed a report that the White House tapes do
at contradict Dean's testimony. Dean, former White
ouse counsel, told the Watergate committee that President
ixon knew of the Watergate cover-up before last March
I, the date Nixon said he was told about it.
Jaworski's staff filed a memorandum in federal court
ying that "the government plans to call John W. Dean 111
a witness," at the trial of charges against former
residential appointments secretary Dwight L. Chapin.
Chapin was indicted last Nov. 29, on four counts of
ing to a grand jury about the activities of Donald H.

Segretti, who worked as an underground political agent for
President Nixon's re-election campaign committee in 1972.
Chapin pleaded innocent to the charges. His attorneys
indicated they planned to attempt to bar Dean's testimony
on the grounds he and Chapin had an attorney-client
relationship when Dean was White House counsel.
The memorandum, signed by Jaworski, said that in his
White House job, Dean's primary "client" was the United
States and the office of the President "not the subordinate
employees and officials employed at the White House."
Scott had told reporters he knew of grounds for "several
indictments against Mr. Dean" for perjury.
Scott said the material he has seen indicated that Dean
"testified as to matters that did not occur on the dates and
times he said they occurred."
More British Miners May Strike
LONDON — Yorkshire coal miners agreed yesterday to
press for a national strike that could cut back electricity
enough by spring to threaten a halt in British industry.
The strike call from Barnsley in Yorkshire represented
the views of 65,000 miners who work coal fields in that
northern England region.
It was the first time in the 11-week pay dispute between
coal miners and the government that a union branch had
officially demanded a strike.
The executive of the National Union of Mineworkers,
which represents 270,000 men throughout Britain, meets in
London today to consider whether to call a membership
vote on the strike call. Demands for the vote are expected
to be overwhelming.
Joe Gormley, the union president, has estimated that 70
percent of the 280,000 miners favor a strike, 15 percent
more than needed to vote a walkout.
The union's current overtime ban has cut coal
production by a third, touching off what Prime Minister
Edward Heath has called Britain's gravest economic crisis
since World War 11.
Heath put the nation on a three-day work week to
conserve energy. Seventy percent of Britain's electricity
comes from coal. An all-out strike could completely cut off
coal supplies by spring, forcing an industrial shutdown.
Younger Seeks Re-election
LOS ANGELES — Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger said
yesterday he would run for re-election rather than seek the
Republican gubernatorial nomination.
"My decision is based not so much on the difficulty
involved in running for governor but more on the feeling of
pride on what I have accomplished in the attorney general's
office in the last three years and the conviction that I can
accomplish even more in the next three years," he told a
news conference.
He said statistics released last week by the Bureau of
Criminal Statistics indicate that "for the first time in 13
years, the crime rate in California is going to be down."
Younger, 55, said the Watergate scandal also influenced
his decision, since it has discouraged many Republican
financial contributors. He said a gubernatorial campaign
could conceivably cost $4.5 million.
"I find the prospect of seeking such large contributions
distasteful, and frankly I don't know if I could be
successful if I tried," he said.

Israelis Begin Suez Withdrawal
Israeli tanks and troops began withdrawing from the
west bank of Egypt's Suez Canal yesterday. Jordan and
Syria were reported pursuing their own military
disengagement agreements with Israel.
Israel permitted Egyptian medical teams through Israeli
lines on the west side of the canal to evacuate 300 wounded
Egyptian troops, trapped in the city of Suez since last
October's Arab-Israeli war, the Israeli state radio said. The
Israelis began pulling equipment off the west side of the
canal two days ahead of schedule.
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt told newsmen in Rabat,
Morocco, that he has "noted among the Syrians a readiness
to agree to such disengagement." He declined to elaborate,
but said a Syrian-Israeli agreement similar to last week's
accord to separate the Egyptian and Israeli armies was the
next essential step on the road to peace.
Morton Signs Pipeline Permit
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B.
Morton yesterday signed the long-awaited permit for a
789-mile, $5 billion pipeline to tap the rich oil fields of
Alaska's North Slope.
Construction is expected to start this spring.
"With a little cooperation from the weather man, I am
optimistic that the oil of the North Slope will reach
markets in the lower 48 states by 1977," Morton said.
Officials of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which will
build and operate the line, handed Morton a check for
$12.15 million to pay for environmental studies in
connection with construction.
The pipeline will run from the oil deposits of the
Prudhoe Bay area on the Arctic Ocean to tanker
connections at the ice-free Port of Valdez on Prince William
Sound.
A permit must still be issued by the state of Alaska.
Issuance of the federal permit was delayed by court
action by environmental groups which stretched over three
years.
Congress last year passed legislation designed to clear
away legal obstacles to construction of the pipeline, the
largest such project ever undertaken by private industry.

coal miners and the government that a union branch had
officially demanded a strike.
The executive of the National Union of Mineworkers,
which represents 270,000 men throughout Britain, meets in
London today to consider whether to call a membership
vote on the strike call. Demands for the vote are expected
to be overwhelming.
Joe Gormley, the union president, has estimated that 70
percent of the 280,000 miners favor a strike, 15 percent
more than needed to vote a walkout.
The union's current overtime ban has cut coal
production by a third, touching off what Prime Minister
Edward Heath has called Britain's gravest economic crisis
since World War 11.
Heath put the nation on a three-day work week to
conserve energy. Seventy percent of Britain's electricity
comes from coal. An all-out strike could completely cut off
coal supplies by spring, forcing an industrial shutdown.
Younger Seeks Re-election
LOS ANGELES — Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger said
yesterday he would run for re-election rather than seek the
Republican gubernatorial nomination.
"My decision is based not so much on the difficulty
involved in running for governor but more on the feeling of
pride on what I have accomplished in the attorney general's
office in the last three years and the conviction that I can
accomplish even more in the next three years," he told a
news conference.
He said statistics released last week by the Bureau of
Criminal Statistics indicate that "for the first time in 13
years, the crime rate in California is going to be down."
Younger, 55, said the Watergate scandal also influenced
his decision, since it has discouraged many Republican
financial contributors. He said a gubernatorial campaign
could conceivably cost $4.5 million.
"I find the prospect of seeking such large contributions
distasteful, and frankly I don't know if I could be
successful if I tried," he said.

Israelis Begin Suez Withdrawal
Israeli tanks and troops began withdrawing from the
west bank of Egypt's Suez Canal yesterday. Jordan and
Syria were reported pursuing their own military
disengagement agreements with Israel.
Israel permitted Egyptian medical teams through Israeli
lines on the west side of the canal to evacuate 300 wounded
Egyptian troops, trapped in the city of Suez since last
October's Arab-Israeli war, the Israeli state radio said. The
Israelis began pulling equipment off the west side of the
canal two days ahead of schedule.
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt told newsmen in Rabat,
Morocco, that he has "noted among the Syrians a readiness
to agree to such disengagement." He declined to elaborate,
but said a Syrian-Israeli agreement similar to last week's
accord to separate the Egyptian and Israeli armies was the
next essential step on the road to peace.
Morton Signs Pipeline Permit
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B.
Morton yesterday signed the long-awaited permit for a
789-mile, $5 billion pipeline to tap the rich oil fields of
Alaska's North Slope.
Construction is expected to start this spring.
"With a little cooperation from the weather man, I am
optimistic that the oil of the North Slope will reach
markets in the lower 48 states by 1977," Morton said.
Officials of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which will
build and operate the line, handed Morton a check for
$12.15 million to pay for environmental studies in
connection with construction.
The pipeline will run from the oil deposits of the
Prudhoe Bay area on the Arctic Ocean to tanker
connections at the ice-free Port of Valdez on Prince William
Sound.
A permit must still be issued by the state of Alaska.
Issuance of the federal permit was delayed by court
action by environmental groups which stretched over three
years.
Congress last year passed legislation designed to clear
away legal obstacles to construction of the pipeline, the
largest such project ever undertaken by private industry.
Dean To Testify Against Chapin
WASHINGTON — Special prosecutor Leon Jaworski said
yesterday that John W. Dean 111 will be "a major
government witness" in a Watergate case against a former
White House aide.
Meanwhile, Senate Republican leader Hugh Scott
>peated his assertion that he has seen evidence that Dean
to the Senate Watergate committee.
Scott disputed a report that the White House tapes do
at contradict Dean's testimony. Dean, former White
ouse counsel, told the Watergate committee that President
ixon knew of the Watergate cover-up before last March
I, the date Nixon said he was told about it.
Jaworski's staff filed a memorandum in federal court
ying that "the government plans to call John W. Dean 111
a witness," at the trial of charges against former
residential appointments secretary Dwight L. Chapin.
Chapin was indicted last Nov. 29, on four counts of
ing to a grand jury about the activities of Donald H.

Segretti, who worked as an underground political agent for
President Nixon's re-election campaign committee in 1972.
Chapin pleaded innocent to the charges. His attorneys
indicated they planned to attempt to bar Dean's testimony
on the grounds he and Chapin had an attorney-client
relationship when Dean was White House counsel.
The memorandum, signed by Jaworski, said that in his
White House job, Dean's primary "client" was the United
States and the office of the President "not the subordinate
employees and officials employed at the White House."
Scott had told reporters he knew of grounds for "several
indictments against Mr. Dean" for perjury.
Scott said the material he has seen indicated that Dean
"testified as to matters that did not occur on the dates and
times he said they occurred."
More British Miners May Strike
LONDON — Yorkshire coal miners agreed yesterday to
press for a national strike that could cut back electricity
enough by spring to threaten a halt in British industry.
The strike call from Barnsley in Yorkshire represented
