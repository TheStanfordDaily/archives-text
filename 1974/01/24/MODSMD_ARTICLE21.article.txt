# Faculty-Staff Directory Errors Caused By Humans, Computers
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Inaccuracies in the 1974 faculty-staff directory resulted
from timing problems, computer difficulties and human
errors, according to a University official.
The most blatant mistakes reported to the Daily or the
Personnel Department were the listings for the 19 staff
members of the Center for Radar Astronomy which
included 14 incorrect entires. Secretaries there have made
up a corrected list of their employee information for
distribution to other departments.
Joanna Hash, manager of systems and personnel, who
was in charge of compiling and publishing the director, said
these mistakes were "clearly a problem of system
response."
Hash explained that last year there was a separate data
file for the faculty-staff directory. Since this file duplicated
much of the payroll data, the two files were combined. All
of the bugs created by this merger were not worked out
before publication, Hash explained.
Computer Tapes
She said that selected information on all staff, faculty,
retired professors, clinic personnel and some individuals at
the University Hospital was put on tape by the computer.
This tape was sent to the publisher, who translated the code
into print. Stanford used the same publisher that publishes
the directories for Pacific Telephone.
The proof sheets were proofread "several times in
Personnel," said Hash. "Finally, we made the decision to go
to press and hope it was the best we could do." The
alternative, she explained, was putting it off until after
Christmas break.
The inaccuracies have caused small problems for
secretaries. Christina Moughamian at the Stanford
Instructional Television Network said, "You waste a lot of
time if you want to get hold of anybody." She also

explained another reason for problems: 'The staff in
electronics is constantly changing. 1 don't know if they
don't report the office changes or if they just don't keep
the records up to date."
Timing
Some of the inaccuracies, Hash explained, are due to
timing. Information to be listed in the directory was sent to
departments for verification in September. Since the
directory did not come out until December, any changes
made during the three month gap were not corrected in the
publication. In September, employees were also given the
option of not having their home addresses listed.
According to Hash, problems in office phone extension
numbers will not last very long. In April, Stanford offices
are changing to a "Centrex" system, in which calls from
off-campus will be made directly to extensions instead of
going through the switchboard. Since some extensions
changes will be made, Personnel will be publishing an
additional issue of the directory in April.
Office Numbers
This new edition will contain only office numbers, Hash
said. The additional information will r.ot go on sale at the
bookstore, nor will it be offered to students who have
already paid three dollars for the current directory.
"When we looked at the small amount of information
that was going to change, we felt very comfortable that this
issue was usable," said Hash.
She added that until the phone system change is
common knowledge, callers using the old numbers will
reach an intercepting operator who will explain the new
system and give out correct extension numbers.
The faculty-staff directory is distributed to departments
with University extensions, and an additional 2000 copies
are usually sent to the bookstore for sale to students or
others off campus who may need the information.

these mistakes were "clearly a problem of system
response."
Hash explained that last year there was a separate data
file for the faculty-staff directory. Since this file duplicated
much of the payroll data, the two files were combined. All
of the bugs created by this merger were not worked out
before publication, Hash explained.
Computer Tapes
She said that selected information on all staff, faculty,
retired professors, clinic personnel and some individuals at
the University Hospital was put on tape by the computer.
This tape was sent to the publisher, who translated the code
into print. Stanford used the same publisher that publishes
the directories for Pacific Telephone.
The proof sheets were proofread "several times in
Personnel," said Hash. "Finally, we made the decision to go
to press and hope it was the best we could do." The
alternative, she explained, was putting it off until after
Christmas break.
The inaccuracies have caused small problems for
secretaries. Christina Moughamian at the Stanford
Instructional Television Network said, "You waste a lot of
time if you want to get hold of anybody." She also

explained another reason for problems: 'The staff in
electronics is constantly changing. 1 don't know if they
don't report the office changes or if they just don't keep
the records up to date."
Timing
Some of the inaccuracies, Hash explained, are due to
timing. Information to be listed in the directory was sent to
departments for verification in September. Since the
directory did not come out until December, any changes
made during the three month gap were not corrected in the
publication. In September, employees were also given the
option of not having their home addresses listed.
According to Hash, problems in office phone extension
numbers will not last very long. In April, Stanford offices
are changing to a "Centrex" system, in which calls from
off-campus will be made directly to extensions instead of
going through the switchboard. Since some extensions
changes will be made, Personnel will be publishing an
additional issue of the directory in April.
Office Numbers
This new edition will contain only office numbers, Hash
said. The additional information will r.ot go on sale at the
bookstore, nor will it be offered to students who have
already paid three dollars for the current directory.
"When we looked at the small amount of information
that was going to change, we felt very comfortable that this
issue was usable," said Hash.
She added that until the phone system change is
common knowledge, callers using the old numbers will
reach an intercepting operator who will explain the new
system and give out correct extension numbers.
The faculty-staff directory is distributed to departments
with University extensions, and an additional 2000 copies
are usually sent to the bookstore for sale to students or
others off campus who may need the information.
Inaccuracies in the 1974 faculty-staff directory resulted
from timing problems, computer difficulties and human
errors, according to a University official.
The most blatant mistakes reported to the Daily or the
Personnel Department were the listings for the 19 staff
members of the Center for Radar Astronomy which
included 14 incorrect entires. Secretaries there have made
up a corrected list of their employee information for
distribution to other departments.

was in charge of compiling and publishing the director, said
