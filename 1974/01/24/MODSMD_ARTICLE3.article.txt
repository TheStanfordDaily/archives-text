# Energy Use Drops From Last Year
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
University fuel consumption
dropped 21 percent and electrical
power use fell 20.4 percent during the
first part of this month over the same
period last year, according to figures
released yesterday by Plant Services
Director Dan DeYoung.
Despite the reductions, however,
the University's fuel and electrical bills
are roughly the same for this month as
they were a year ago.
"We are, on the whole, very
satisfied with the results of our
power-saving campaign," stated
DeYoung. "Not only are we
conserving resources, but we've saved
one tremendous amount of money as
well.
"If we hadn't cut use, our fuel bill
would have skyrocketed, and increased
costs would have to have been passed
on to the students," he said.
DeYoung also noted that the
University has received an additional
allocation of fuel oil from the federal
government, enabling the University to
purchase a seven-day reserve supply.
Oil is used to heat the University
when Pacific Gas & Electric shuts off
the supply of natural gas; DeYoung
expects two or three more days of
shutdowns this winter.
DeYoung commented that the
University had exceeded PG&E's
requests that all customers reduce
consumption by 15 percent.
"I think our efforts can serve as an
example not only to the local
community, but to the entire state as
well," said DeYoung.
"We've cut back a great deal of
consumption with virtually no adverse
effects," he added. "I don't think
anyone's been inconvenienced; we've
just stopped being so wasteful. We've
had very few complaints from the
community, and much cooperation."
This month's consumption
cutbacks followed an energy use
decrease of 36 percent during
Christmas recess and above 15 percent
during December over corresponding
periods in 1972. However, the
University's electrical bill for
December, 1973, was still five percent
higher than it was the year before,
according to DeYoung.
