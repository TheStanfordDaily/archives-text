# Nobel Winner Arrow Considers Stanford's Professorship Offer
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Nobel Prize-winning economist
Kenneth J. Arrow expects to decide
within the next three weeks whether
he will accept an offer to rejoin the
faculty here after a six-year absence.
Arrow taught economics and
statistics here for nearly 20 years
before accepting the endowed Frank
W. Taussing research professorship in
economics at Harvard in 1968. The
Daily has learned that he will receive a
newly created, endowed professorship
in economics and operations research
if he accepts Stanford's offer.
Provost William F. Miller said last
night he was "reluctant to name the
donor" who contributed money for
the endowed chair because "the chair
has not been established and would
not be established unless we were able
to seize upon this unusual opportunity
to get Arrow back."
Stanford Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey L. Royden called
Arrow "the most distinguished
mathematical economist in the
world." He and Sir John Hicks of
Oxford University won the 1972

Nobel Prize in Economics for what the
Royal Swedish Academy of Science
called "their pioneering contributions
to the general economic equilibrium
theory and welfare theory."
Arrow received the prize for his
work on the Impossibility Theorem
and the Theory of General Economic
Equilibrium. The Impossibility
Theorem demonstrates that in
principle there cannot be any perfect
form of government.
'Crimson' Reports Offer
The Harvard Crimson reported last
week that Arrow "is thinking very
seriously about accepting" Stanford's
offer, but also said he received a
similar offer from Yale after officials
there learned of the Stanford proposal.
When contacted by the Daily last
night in Cambridge, Mass., Arrow said
he left the faculty here in 1968
because "the Economics Department
needed more [financial] support than
it was then getting from the
University." However, he added that
Stanford is now "giving the
department much more support and it
has expanded in size."
Arrow said Provost Miller made the
official offer of a professorship, but
that he had also been contacted by
Royden and Economics Department
Chairman Moses Abramovitz.
'Arrow Economic Leader'
Saying that Arrow is "a leading
figure in the development of basic
economic theory," Abramovitz
revealed that "we're doing our best to
create conditions that Arrow will
regard as favorable to the development
of his own work, not to mention the
comfort and happiness of his family."
Abramovitz said Arrow's addition
to the faculty would be "a great
inspiration to both students and
faculty in the department" and
pointed out that he would be
"absolutely superb as a resource for
graduate students and junior
colleagues."
One Harvard official was quoted by
the Crimson as saying that Arrow's
departure would be "an extremely
severe loss to our department. You
just can't lose a man of that caliber
and not suffer," the official said. "Ken
Arrow is just not an ordinary
professor, even by Harvard standards."

Arrow received the prize for his
work on the Impossibility Theorem
and the Theory of General Economic
Equilibrium. The Impossibility
Theorem demonstrates that in
principle there cannot be any perfect
form of government.
'Crimson' Reports Offer
The Harvard Crimson reported last
week that Arrow "is thinking very
seriously about accepting" Stanford's
offer, but also said he received a
similar offer from Yale after officials
there learned of the Stanford proposal.
When contacted by the Daily last
night in Cambridge, Mass., Arrow said
he left the faculty here in 1968
because "the Economics Department
needed more [financial] support than
it was then getting from the
University." However, he added that
Stanford is now "giving the
department much more support and it
has expanded in size."
Arrow said Provost Miller made the
official offer of a professorship, but
that he had also been contacted by
Royden and Economics Department
Chairman Moses Abramovitz.
'Arrow Economic Leader'
Saying that Arrow is "a leading
figure in the development of basic
economic theory," Abramovitz
revealed that "we're doing our best to
create conditions that Arrow will
regard as favorable to the development
of his own work, not to mention the
comfort and happiness of his family."
Abramovitz said Arrow's addition
to the faculty would be "a great
inspiration to both students and
faculty in the department" and
pointed out that he would be
"absolutely superb as a resource for
graduate students and junior
colleagues."
One Harvard official was quoted by
the Crimson as saying that Arrow's
departure would be "an extremely
severe loss to our department. You
just can't lose a man of that caliber
and not suffer," the official said. "Ken
Arrow is just not an ordinary
professor, even by Harvard standards."

RETURNING LAUREATE — Nobel Prize winner Kenneth J. Arrow, who left
the Stanford faculty in 1968, is considering returning from Harvard.
Nobel Prize-winning economist
Kenneth J. Arrow expects to decide
within the next three weeks whether
he will accept an offer to rejoin the
faculty here after a six-year absence.
Arrow taught economics and
statistics here for nearly 20 years
before accepting the endowed Frank
W. Taussing research professorship in
economics at Harvard in 1968. The
Daily has learned that he will receive a
newly created, endowed professorship
in economics and operations research
if he accepts Stanford's offer.
Provost William F. Miller said last
night he was "reluctant to name the
donor" who contributed money for
the endowed chair because "the chair
has not been established and would
not be established unless we were able
to seize upon this unusual opportunity
to get Arrow back."
Stanford Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey L. Royden called
Arrow "the most distinguished
mathematical economist in the
world." He and Sir John Hicks of
Oxford University won the 1972

Nobel Prize in Economics for what the
Royal Swedish Academy of Science
called "their pioneering contributions
to the general economic equilibrium
theory and welfare theory."
Arrow received the prize for his
work on the Impossibility Theorem
and the Theory of General Economic
Equilibrium. The Impossibility
Theorem demonstrates that in
principle there cannot be any perfect
form of government.
