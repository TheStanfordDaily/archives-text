# Relax Air Quality Standards

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Nixon proposed
yesterday easing clean-air standards and cutting tax breaks
for overseas oil production by U.S. companies, to cope with
the energy crisis.
Nixon also ordered a tenfold increase in federal offshore
leasing for petroleum development and a study of possible
future oil and gas pipelines from northern Alaska.
The new measures appeared certain to arouse
controversy, provoking environment groups on one hand
and oil companies on the other.
Nixon also said he would propose that the federal
government spend $1.8 billion for energy research in his
forthcoming budget for fiscal 1975..This would include
$426.7 million — 2.6 times as much as in fiscal 1974 — for
a coal research program expected to total some $2.9 billion
over the next five years.
Nixon also revived his past proposal for mandatory
labeling of automobiles and major appliances to show how
efficiently they use energy.
Voluntary Program
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Commerce Department have launched such labeling
programs on a voluntary basis, and EPA publicizes the
gasoline-mileage performance of the new cars it tests under
its antipollution programs.
Nixon also urged Congress to complete action on

legislation proposed earlier, including a stripped-down
emergency energy bill to authorize rationing and temporary
relaxation of clean-air standards.
He urged passage of a separate bill under which windfall
profits made by oil companies as a result of the energy
crisis would pay for research aimed at increasing energy
supplies and lowering prices.
Big Profit Rise
In New York, Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil
company, estimated Wednesday that its profits in the final
three months of 1973 were almost 60 percent higher than
during the same period of 1972.
The international refiner also said its profits for all of
1973 also showed an increase of almost 60 percent.
"We must not permit private profiteering at the expense
of public sacrifice," Nixon said. "The sacrifices made by
the American people must be for the benefit of all the
people, not just for the benefit of big business.
"In equal measure," he added, "we must not permit the
big oil companies or any other major domestic energy
producers to manipulate the public by withholding
information on their energy supplies."
To prevent that, Nixon again proposed legislation
requiring the oil companies to report their inventories,
production, costs and reserves to the government.
