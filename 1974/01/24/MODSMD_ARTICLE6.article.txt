# Black Center Suffers As Interest Wanes

### ROY VERLEY 
After five productive years,
Stanford's Black Student Volunteer
Center (BSVC) may be in trouble.
According to Director Thomas Massey,
1974 will be the center's most critical
year to date.
Founded by black students in 1969
to help bring tutoring and educational
counseling to the local black
community, the BSVC has endured in
an age when a host of other volunteer
groups have come and gone. But the
burden of sustaining student interest
heads the center's problems.
"We have passed through the
altruistic stage," said Massey. "We no
longer have the appeal of novelty to
carry us along. I guess you could say
we're down to the basic problem once
again that led to the founding of the
center. The need for tutoring and
counseling is still there. Finding the
people to fill the need is the problem."
Massey, 27, a Ph.D. candidate in
education here, sees BSVC in the
midst of a transition from youthful
exuberance to more traditional
routinization. In Massey's estimation
the results so far have not been
favorable.
Waning Student Interest
"Waning student interest is our
most pressing concern," Massey, now
in his third year as director of the

center, conceded. "Most of the old
hard-core members are gone, either
through graduation or other interests.
We need new people, especially
freshmen and sophomores, to replace
them. It's quite apparent that without
new faces our effectiveness will be
reduced."
Now that skepticism in the
community about Stanford volunteers
has been overcome, Massey feels the
goals of BSVC are coming within reach
— provided the center finds the
volunteers to follow through.
"We maintain as a primary
objective the satisfaction of
educational needs in the black
community," said Massey. "We offer
opportunities for assistance to high
school and junior high school students
which might not otherwise be available
to them.
"Our tutoring and peer counseling
activities have helped create a kind of
alternative school within the
secondary schools for students who
feel such a need," he declared.
Diverse Approach
Unlike many tutorial programs, the
Volunteer Center's format has taken
diverse approaches which Stanford
students can gear to their own skills.
"The program works around the
competencies of the volunteers,"
explained the director. For some it is a

chance to do community work for
course credit. For others it is a vehicle
for getting away from the university
environment. Too often, because the
university is so cloistered, it comes as a
shock for middle class black students
to see what the outside world is really
like."
For many volunteers, work-study
programs offer the greatest attraction.
Students in need of financial assistance
are paid by the Federal government to
do community work. Work-study
programs sponsored by the center are
financed about 80 percent, with funds
made available through HEW. At Palo
Alto High School, where these
activities thrive, the school pays the
other 20 percent. At East Palo Alto's
Ravenswood High School, BSVC picks
up the rest of the tab. Liberal funding
through the Stanford Student Services
Office, which pays the director's salary
and maintains a full-time staff at the
center office in the Nitery, makes such
financial assistance to Ravenswood
possible. Work-study students must
show financial need at a
federally-regulated level in order to
qualify for compensation.
Course Credit

are required to attend a weekly
three-hour seminar in addition to their

Garden Oaks Junior High School. She is one of 100 volunteers in the program
on-the-job chores. The seminar, led by
Massey, is designed to teach proper
techniques of tutoring and counseling.
"We don't believe we should be
setting a bunch of untrained
volunteers free on the community,"
said Massey. At least five hours of
tutoring each week are expected of
each student to earn credit for the
five-unit course.
The tutoring, or Right to Read,
program is only one of several that
Stanford students may select. The
center's other concerns are in the areas
of Afro-American studies, cultural
awareness and summer school. The
Center also sponsors College Day,
Community Education Forum and
Community Work Projects in
non-educational settings. The
Publications Project recently published
a black history primer, A Journey
B(l)ack, to supplement standard texts
now in use in elementary schools.
The total program offered by the
Volunteer Center is innovative and

ambitious. The fear of Massey, Norma
Ishman, administrative assistant
Cynthia McCall, and some of the other
100 persons serving the center is that
not enough people will step forward to
lend a hand. This, of course, has been
the bane of many volunteer
organizations. It is just catching up
with BSVC.
McCall and Massey cite many
reasons for the dwindling numbers.
The loss of novelty is the primary
reason. A shift of black student body
interests into professional fields, such
as law and medicine, is another.
Downward adjustments in student
eligibility, caused by an overall
improvement in financial reserves of
work-study applicants, is a third key
determinant. Said McCall, "If students
can't get paid, they don't want to
work." Some students, she added,
have lost as much as $500 in
work-study eligibility in the past year.
Because the level of need is
established by HEW, no additional aid
can be provided for such students,

according to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
"This is not a case of inadequate
university funding," Lyons said. "The
Financial Aids Office must work
within prescribed guidelines handed
down by the federal government.
"The university cannot maintain a
policy to perpetuate BSVC. If it dies,
it dies. That seems to be the nature of
volunteer organizations."
If these difficulties aren't enough to
discourage BSVC members, another
waits in the wings with more
far-reaching consequences. Director
Massey will be stepping down from his
post within the next year, leaving his
successor with some rather large shoes
to fill.
"I have tried lately to shift the
focus of the center away from me and
onto the organization itself," said
Massey. "That's the way it should be
now that the center is on its feet. An
organization is much more effective
than a single man. Our future lies in
building that organization."

post within the next year, leaving his
successor with some rather large shoes
to fill.
"I have tried lately to shift the
focus of the center away from me and
onto the organization itself," said
Massey. "That's the way it should be
now that the center is on its feet. An
organization is much more effective
than a single man. Our future lies in
building that organization."
After five productive years,
Stanford's Black Student Volunteer
Center (BSVC) may be in trouble.
According to Director Thomas Massey,
1974 will be the center's most critical
year to date.
Founded by black students in 1969
to help bring tutoring and educational
counseling to the local black
community, the BSVC has endured in
an age when a host of other volunteer
groups have come and gone. But the
burden of sustaining student interest
heads the center's problems.
"We have passed through the
altruistic stage," said Massey. "We no
longer have the appeal of novelty to
carry us along. I guess you could say
we're down to the basic problem once
again that led to the founding of the
center. The need for tutoring and
counseling is still there. Finding the
people to fill the need is the problem."
Massey, 27, a Ph.D. candidate in
education here, sees BSVC in the
midst of a transition from youthful
exuberance to more traditional
routinization. In Massey's estimation
the results so far have not been
favorable.
Waning Student Interest
"Waning student interest is our
most pressing concern," Massey, now
in his third year as director of the

center, conceded. "Most of the old
hard-core members are gone, either
through graduation or other interests.
We need new people, especially
freshmen and sophomores, to replace
them. It's quite apparent that without
new faces our effectiveness will be
reduced."
Now that skepticism in the
community about Stanford volunteers
has been overcome, Massey feels the
goals of BSVC are coming within reach
— provided the center finds the
volunteers to follow through.
"We maintain as a primary
objective the satisfaction of
educational needs in the black
community," said Massey. "We offer
opportunities for assistance to high
school and junior high school students
which might not otherwise be available
to them.
"Our tutoring and peer counseling
activities have helped create a kind of
alternative school within the
secondary schools for students who
feel such a need," he declared.
Diverse Approach
Unlike many tutorial programs, the
Volunteer Center's format has taken
diverse approaches which Stanford
students can gear to their own skills.
"The program works around the
competencies of the volunteers,"
explained the director. For some it is a

chance to do community work for
course credit. For others it is a vehicle
for getting away from the university
environment. Too often, because the
university is so cloistered, it comes as a
shock for middle class black students
to see what the outside world is really
like."
For many volunteers, work-study
programs offer the greatest attraction.
Students in need of financial assistance
are paid by the Federal government to
do community work. Work-study
programs sponsored by the center are
financed about 80 percent, with funds
made available through HEW. At Palo
Alto High School, where these
activities thrive, the school pays the
other 20 percent. At East Palo Alto's
Ravenswood High School, BSVC picks
up the rest of the tab. Liberal funding
through the Stanford Student Services
Office, which pays the director's salary
and maintains a full-time staff at the
center office in the Nitery, makes such
financial assistance to Ravenswood
possible. Work-study students must
show financial need at a
federally-regulated level in order to
qualify for compensation.
Course Credit

three-hour seminar in addition to their

BSVC TUTOR — Sophomore Sherrie Ford gives of her time tutoring students a
Garden Oaks Junior High School. She is one of 100 volunteers in the program
on-the-job chores. The seminar, led by
Massey, is designed to teach proper
techniques of tutoring and counseling.
"We don't believe we should be
setting a bunch of untrained
volunteers free on the community,"
said Massey. At least five hours of
tutoring each week are expected of
each student to earn credit for the
five-unit course.
The tutoring, or Right to Read,
program is only one of several that
Stanford students may select. The
center's other concerns are in the areas
of Afro-American studies, cultural
awareness and summer school. The
Center also sponsors College Day,
Community Education Forum and
Community Work Projects in
non-educational settings. The
Publications Project recently published
a black history primer, A Journey
B(l)ack, to supplement standard texts
now in use in elementary schools.
The total program offered by the
Volunteer Center is innovative and

ambitious. The fear of Massey, Norma
Ishman, administrative assistant
Cynthia McCall, and some of the other
100 persons serving the center is that
not enough people will step forward to
lend a hand. This, of course, has been
the bane of many volunteer
organizations. It is just catching up
with BSVC.
McCall and Massey cite many
reasons for the dwindling numbers.
The loss of novelty is the primary
reason. A shift of black student body
interests into professional fields, such
as law and medicine, is another.
Downward adjustments in student
eligibility, caused by an overall
improvement in financial reserves of
work-study applicants, is a third key
determinant. Said McCall, "If students
can't get paid, they don't want to
work." Some students, she added,
have lost as much as $500 in
work-study eligibility in the past year.
Because the level of need is
established by HEW, no additional aid
can be provided for such students,

according to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
"This is not a case of inadequate
university funding," Lyons said. "The
Financial Aids Office must work
within prescribed guidelines handed
down by the federal government.
"The university cannot maintain a
policy to perpetuate BSVC. If it dies,
it dies. That seems to be the nature of
volunteer organizations."
If these difficulties aren't enough to
discourage BSVC members, another
waits in the wings with more
far-reaching consequences. Director
Massey will be stepping down from his
post within the next year, leaving his
successor with some rather large shoes
to fill.
"I have tried lately to shift the
focus of the center away from me and

within prescribed guidelines handed
down by the federal government.
"The university cannot maintain a
policy to perpetuate BSVC. If it dies,
it dies. That seems to be the nature of
volunteer organizations."
If these difficulties aren't enough to
discourage BSVC members, another
waits in the wings with more
far-reaching consequences. Director
Massey will be stepping down from his
post within the next year, leaving his
successor with some rather large shoes
to fill.
"I have tried lately to shift the
focus of the center away from me and
onto the organization itself," said
Massey. "That's the way it should be
now that the center is on its feet. An
organization is much more effective
than a single man. Our future lies in
building that organization."
After five productive years,
Stanford's Black Student Volunteer
Center (BSVC) may be in trouble.
According to Director Thomas Massey,
1974 will be the center's most critical
year to date.
Founded by black students in 1969
to help bring tutoring and educational
counseling to the local black
community, the BSVC has endured in
an age when a host of other volunteer
groups have come and gone. But the
burden of sustaining student interest
heads the center's problems.
"We have passed through the
altruistic stage," said Massey. "We no
longer have the appeal of novelty to
carry us along. I guess you could say
we're down to the basic problem once
again that led to the founding of the
center. The need for tutoring and
counseling is still there. Finding the
people to fill the need is the problem."
Massey, 27, a Ph.D. candidate in
education here, sees BSVC in the
midst of a transition from youthful
exuberance to more traditional
routinization. In Massey's estimation
the results so far have not been
favorable.
Waning Student Interest
"Waning student interest is our
most pressing concern," Massey, now
in his third year as director of the

center, conceded. "Most of the old
hard-core members are gone, either
through graduation or other interests.
We need new people, especially
freshmen and sophomores, to replace
them. It's quite apparent that without
new faces our effectiveness will be
reduced."
Now that skepticism in the
community about Stanford volunteers
has been overcome, Massey feels the
goals of BSVC are coming within reach
— provided the center finds the
volunteers to follow through.
"We maintain as a primary
objective the satisfaction of
educational needs in the black
community," said Massey. "We offer
opportunities for assistance to high
school and junior high school students
which might not otherwise be available
to them.
"Our tutoring and peer counseling
activities have helped create a kind of
alternative school within the
secondary schools for students who
feel such a need," he declared.
Diverse Approach
Unlike many tutorial programs, the
Volunteer Center's format has taken
diverse approaches which Stanford
students can gear to their own skills.
"The program works around the
competencies of the volunteers,"
explained the director. For some it is a

chance to do community work for
course credit. For others it is a vehicle
for getting away from the university
environment. Too often, because the
university is so cloistered, it comes as a
shock for middle class black students
to see what the outside world is really
like."
For many volunteers, work-study
programs offer the greatest attraction.
Students in need of financial assistance
are paid by the Federal government to
do community work. Work-study
programs sponsored by the center are
financed about 80 percent, with funds
made available through HEW. At Palo
Alto High School, where these
activities thrive, the school pays the
other 20 percent. At East Palo Alto's
Ravenswood High School, BSVC picks
up the rest of the tab. Liberal funding
through the Stanford Student Services
Office, which pays the director's salary
and maintains a full-time staff at the
center office in the Nitery, makes such
financial assistance to Ravenswood
possible. Work-study students must
show financial need at a
federally-regulated level in order to
qualify for compensation.

three-hour seminar in addition to their

BSVC TUTOR — Sophomore Sherrie Ford gives of her time tutoring students a
Garden Oaks Junior High School. She is one of 100 volunteers in the program
on-the-job chores. The seminar, led by
Massey, is designed to teach proper
techniques of tutoring and counseling.
"We don't believe we should be
setting a bunch of untrained
volunteers free on the community,"
said Massey. At least five hours of
tutoring each week are expected of
each student to earn credit for the
five-unit course.
The tutoring, or Right to Read,
program is only one of several that
Stanford students may select. The
center's other concerns are in the areas
of Afro-American studies, cultural
awareness and summer school. The
Center also sponsors College Day,
Community Education Forum and
Community Work Projects in
non-educational settings. The
Publications Project recently published
a black history primer, A Journey
B(l)ack, to supplement standard texts
now in use in elementary schools.
The total program offered by the
Volunteer Center is innovative and

ambitious. The fear of Massey, Norma
Ishman, administrative assistant
Cynthia McCall, and some of the other
100 persons serving the center is that
not enough people will step forward to
lend a hand. This, of course, has been
the bane of many volunteer
organizations. It is just catching up
with BSVC.
McCall and Massey cite many
reasons for the dwindling numbers.
The loss of novelty is the primary
reason. A shift of black student body
interests into professional fields, such
as law and medicine, is another.
Downward adjustments in student
eligibility, caused by an overall
improvement in financial reserves of
work-study applicants, is a third key
determinant. Said McCall, "If students
can't get paid, they don't want to
work." Some students, she added,
have lost as much as $500 in
work-study eligibility in the past year.
Because the level of need is
established by HEW, no additional aid
can be provided for such students,

according to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
"This is not a case of inadequate
university funding," Lyons said. "The
Financial Aids Office must work
within prescribed guidelines handed
down by the federal government.
"The university cannot maintain a
policy to perpetuate BSVC. If it dies,
it dies. That seems to be the nature of

work." Some students, she added,
have lost as much as $500 in
work-study eligibility in the past year.

established by HEW, no additional aid

according to Dean of Student Affairs

"This is not a case of inadequate
university funding," Lyons said. "The
Financial Aids Office must work
within prescribed guidelines handed

"The university cannot maintain a
policy to perpetuate BSVC. If it dies,
it dies. That seems to be the nature of

far-reaching consequences. Director
Massey will be stepping down from his
post within the next year, leaving his
successor with some rather large shoes
to fill.
"I have tried lately to shift the
focus of the center away from me and
onto the organization itself," said
Massey. "That's the way it should be
now that the center is on its feet. An
organization is much more effective
than a single man. Our future lies in
building that organization."
