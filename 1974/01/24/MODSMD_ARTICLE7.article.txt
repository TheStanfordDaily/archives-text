## Defer ROTC 
### 
Two weeks ago, the Faculty Senate voted to postpone indefinitely
any preparations by its Steering Committee for a discussion of
ROTC. In effect, the Senate decided not to initiate such discussion.
This afternoon, the question is up again, although in a new, less
ambiguous form. The Senate will consider alternative procedures to
follow in its discussion of ROTC. One of the alternatives is indefinite
postponement.
This is not a contradiction â€” at least in the peculiar world of
Faculty Senate politics. It is merely a disappointing bit of
parliamentary legerdemain.
The original Senate vote, taken in Committee of the Whole,
expressed the sense of the Senate but was not binding. The Senate's
Steering Committee, a body of seven, decided last week to reverse
the whole Senate's action.
It is unclear what events intervened to induce the Steering
Committee to reverse its parent body in the space of a week.
Proceedings of the Steering Committee, like those of the Committee
of the Whole, are confidential. Hut we know of no new development
that might alter the case against consideration of ROTC.
Instead, our objections to ROTC are basic. They center on the
fundamental conflict between military pursuits and academic
standards.
One week ago, we commended the Senate for postponing
consideration of ROTC. We cited ROTC's incorporation of
nonacadernie military purposes in its "academic" program. We
pointed out that ROTC cadets are subject to military codes of
discipline, and are denied the right to speak out on public and
intellectual issues without fear of official punishment.
"These features are, we believe, fundamentally hostile to
Stanford's better traditions of academic freedom," we wrote. "They
are present in some measure in every ROTC program yet suggested or
devised."
Those objections still stand. No ROTC program yet proposed even
approaches reasonable standards of academic freedom and university
control.
We urge the Faculty Senate to affirm its position of two weeks
past, and to defer consideration of ROTC indefinitely. This is still
one sleeping dog the Senate ought to let lie.
