Don't Resurrect ROTC
Editor:
I don't know what office Larry
Diamond is running for, but his
proposal to "on-ROTC" smacks of the
conversion to accomodating
"reasonableness" on some issue that so
often precedes a candidate's decision
to firmly and forthrightly straddle the
nearest political fence.
Despite Diamond's impression that
the ROTC issue "has changed in
fundamental respects," I see no
evidence that it has. Eliminating
ROTC at Stanford was not simply an
effort to stop the war in Vietnam; it
was an admirable step toward
separating the University from the
Pentagon. The ends of the University
are served in no clear way by
establishing formal, legal ties with the
military for training its officers.
The quintessential ideal of the
military is "search and destroy;" the
ideal of the university is "search and
create." These are not compatible
ends. Thus, each instance of formal,
legal links between the two
institutions forces compromises. Those
compromises will always favor the
more powerful of the two institutions,
which in this country (as in west
countries) is the military. The very
fact that Stanford is supposed to be
high on the "Pentagon's list of
priorities for reinstatement" should be
reason enough for Stanford to avoid
new entanglements with the military.
Another aspect of Diamond's
argument is especially repugnant. He
writes, "an officer from Stanford
would seem more likely to question
immoral practices in the future than
one from West Point." Since Diamond
offers no empirical basis for this
assertion, I assume it is based on his
belief in the moral superiority of a
Stanford education, a belief I have
great difficulty imagining evidence for.
Granted Stanford provides a
superior intellectual and academic
environment, there is nothing
remarkable (either for good or bad)
about the ethical environment here.
Ethical behavior at Stanford seems
about the same as one would find at
Lockheed, Macy's or Foothill College.
Thus, the moral consequences of
Stanford schooling hardly seems an
adequate basis for Diamond's
proposal.
As for the impact of a specific
professor on the future ethical
behavior of some student, I am
reminded that Jeb Stuart Magruder
was a star student of William Sloane
Coffin, Jr., at Yale. Or is Mr. Diamond
only concerned with improving the
ethical behavior of military officers,
perhaps in the belief that government
officials and political leaders are
beyond salvation?

In short, I see no compelling reason
to resurrect the ROTC issue. There
must be more important matters for
political hopefuls to spend their
energies on.

lie Realistic
Editor:
Have any of you reading this left
Stanford comfortable with a certain
view of the world and then been
shocked to find how strongly that
view differed with views held outside
of Stanford?
In Friday's Daily (Jan. 18, 1974),
an editorial appeared opposing the
reinstatement of ROTC on the basis of
its incompatibility with the academic
aims of Stanford. The supporting
arguments give a view of both
Stanford and the ROTC which is hard
to reconcile with realities accepted by
most of the outside world. One might
ask if the ROTC provides such a threat
to Staniord's academic aims, why was
this not obvious in the many decades
before the Vietnam War? Why haven't
Stanford's academic standards quickly
soared to new heights since the
departure of the ROTC?
Perhaps some important truth lies
elsewhere. Does Stanford really want
to recognize the realities of the world
or is it happy to withdraw within its
own image of that world? The latter is
clearly very satisfying and hard to
resist while enjoying the good life at
Stanford. Unfortunately, we are not
independent of the real world. It is a
terribly cruel fact that Stanford only
exists because of massive support given
it from the outside world. How much
of that world can Stanford deny and
reject without essential support being
terminated?

Over-Sensitivity
Editor:
The article by Hsu and Chang in the
Daily, Jan. 21, objecting to the article
by Claire Spiegel on Mr. Chang
represents over sensitivity. The original
article was an accurate personal
description of a man whose Chinese
identity is important. It was not a
racial slur. In particular, I would like
to point out that Mr. Chang is known
as "Mr. Chang" to everyone in the
Physics Department. The "Mr." is a
sign of the respect he is given as a
human being. Dropping the "Mr.," as
is done in their article, is a sign of
personal disrespect to him that is
rarely heard. The article by Claire
Spiegel requires no apology.
