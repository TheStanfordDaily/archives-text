# Harris Departure Stirs Turmoil
## Econ Dept. Loses Radical Prof 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Opinions differ on causes of and
solutions to program disputes
currently plaguing the Economics
Department. The controversies
primarily concern student requests
that the department make a firmer
commitment to a program in radical
political economics.
Student dissatisfaction with current
department programs in Marxist
economics, and with limited faculty
trained in the field, has been
exacerbated by the pending departure
of visiting professor Donald Harris,
one of two Marxian economists
currently in the department. The other
is John Gurley.
According to Economics
Department Chairman Moses
Abramovitz, the most recent student
requests came in the form of petitions
drafted by the Union for Radical
Political Economics (URPE) chapter
here, signed by 208 undergraduate and
over 50 graduate students from various
departments, and delivered to the
department shortly before Christmas.
Department members met with
interested students to discuss these
problems at a public meeting a week
ago. A meeting concentrating on the
undergraduate aspects of the problem
will be held at 2:30 on Feb. 1 in TMU
270.
Radical Field
The petitions contained three
requests: that the department make a
"formal commitment" to its program
in Marxian economics; that it support
this field by maintaining a staff of
three economists — a full professor, an
associate professor, and an assistant
professor — "working in and
sympathetic to" the field; and that the
faculty recommend offering Harris a
full-time position.
But although Gurley termed the
Harris departure "a very serious loss,"
and several students indicated a desire
that he stay, the chances of the latter

appear slim.
"I've had several talks with him
[Harris], and I believe that we are in
agreement on the general conditions
under which he would like to be
considered," explained Abramovitz.
He further noted the conditions deal
with "a positive faculty commitment
in Marxian economics," and agreed
under such conditions Harris "might
emerge as a leading candidate for
appointment."
He added, however, "these
conditions don't yet exist. They're
exactly the issues that are now before
the faculty." The faculty meets today
to consider the requests.
Harris Return Unlikely
Harris, who returns after this year
to a tenured position at the University
of Wisconsin, admitted chances of his
remaining are slim. "I have no great
anxiety or desire to remain here," he
confessed, adding he hasn't "been
terribly excited at Stanford."
He explained he "would like to see
serious intellectual or scholarly
interest here [at Stanford] consistent
with my own interests," although
adding "the possibility doesn't exist
here at the moment." Harris, a black,
further explained he desired "to link
up with serious research" of black
scholars applying system analysis to
problems of blacks throughout the
world, but "the University is not
prepared to develop that." He has not
been approached about remaining
here, he concluded.
The question of the department's
"commitment" to a broader program
in Marxian economics also evoked
varied responses. Abramovitz noted
the department had established a
"graduate field" in radical political
economics on a trial basis in response
to URPE requests last year.
Graduate students in the
department must pass comprehensive
examinations in three to five such
"fields" before receiving a degree, and

Abramovitz pointed out "a certain
tentative air" always surrounds new
fields.
He explained the department had
emphasized the trial nature of the
field, because it had been established
after student requests, and the
department hadn't wanted the
students to feel there was "an
unalterable commitment" to it.
Abramovitz Hesitant
But although he admitted "student
interest" and its "importance" as
"part of a liberal education justify at
least some additional offerings,"
Abramovitz maintained the
department needed more experience
before it could consider hiring
additional faculty.
But Harris doesn't "regard Marxian

economics as a field: it's a series of
ideas which permeate the whole
structure of economics."
Abramovitz confessed there seemed
little likelihood of hiring full-time
faculty. Abramovitz explained two
professors would possibly be half of all
the faculty to be hired in the next two
years. If student interest warrants
more faculty, he continued, a visitor
would be located. But he didn't

consider one quarter sufficient
experience, he said.
Further, he called the proposed
criterion of "working in and
sympathetic to Marxian economics" a
"dangerous" one. He called Marxism
in part "a political ideology," adding
"demands for an ideologically or
politically balanced faculty are likely
to follow." But Gurley and Harris
both criticized this reasoning.

under such conditions Harris "might
emerge as a leading candidate for
appointment."
He added, however, "these
conditions don't yet exist. They're
exactly the issues that are now before
the faculty." The faculty meets today
to consider the requests.
Harris Return Unlikely
Harris, who returns after this year
to a tenured position at the University
of Wisconsin, admitted chances of his
remaining are slim. "I have no great
anxiety or desire to remain here," he
confessed, adding he hasn't "been
terribly excited at Stanford."
He explained he "would like to see
serious intellectual or scholarly
interest here [at Stanford] consistent
with my own interests," although
adding "the possibility doesn't exist
here at the moment." Harris, a black,
further explained he desired "to link
up with serious research" of black
scholars applying system analysis to
problems of blacks throughout the
world, but "the University is not
prepared to develop that." He has not
been approached about remaining
here, he concluded.
The question of the department's
"commitment" to a broader program
in Marxian economics also evoked
varied responses. Abramovitz noted
the department had established a
"graduate field" in radical political
economics on a trial basis in response
to URPE requests last year.
Graduate students in the
department must pass comprehensive
examinations in three to five such
"fields" before receiving a degree, and

Abramovitz pointed out "a certain
tentative air" always surrounds new
fields.
He explained the department had
emphasized the trial nature of the
field, because it had been established
after student requests, and the
department hadn't wanted the
students to feel there was "an
unalterable commitment" to it.
Abramovitz Hesitant
But although he admitted "student
interest" and its "importance" as
"part of a liberal education justify at
least some additional offerings,"
Abramovitz maintained the
department needed more experience
before it could consider hiring
additional faculty.

economics as a field: it's a series of
ideas which permeate the whole
structure of economics."
Abramovitz confessed there seemed
little likelihood of hiring full-time
faculty. Abramovitz explained two
professors would possibly be half of all
the faculty to be hired in the next two
years. If student interest warrants
more faculty, he continued, a visitor
would be located. But he didn't

consider one quarter sufficient
experience, he said.
Further, he called the proposed
criterion of "working in and
sympathetic to Marxian economics" a
"dangerous" one. He called Marxism
in part "a political ideology," adding
"demands for an ideologically or
politically balanced faculty are likely
to follow." But Gurley and Harris
both criticized this reasoning.
Opinions differ on causes of and
solutions to program disputes
currently plaguing the Economics
Department. The controversies
primarily concern student requests
that the department make a firmer
commitment to a program in radical
political economics.
Student dissatisfaction with current
department programs in Marxist
economics, and with limited faculty
trained in the field, has been
exacerbated by the pending departure
of visiting professor Donald Harris,
one of two Marxian economists
currently in the department. The other
is John Gurley.
According to Economics
Department Chairman Moses
Abramovitz, the most recent student
requests came in the form of petitions
drafted by the Union for Radical
Political Economics (URPE) chapter
here, signed by 208 undergraduate and
over 50 graduate students from various
departments, and delivered to the
department shortly before Christmas.
Department members met with
interested students to discuss these
problems at a public meeting a week
ago. A meeting concentrating on the
undergraduate aspects of the problem
will be held at 2:30 on Feb. 1 in TMU
270.
Radical Field
The petitions contained three
requests: that the department make a
"formal commitment" to its program
in Marxian economics; that it support
this field by maintaining a staff of
three economists — a full professor, an
associate professor, and an assistant
professor — "working in and
sympathetic to" the field; and that the
faculty recommend offering Harris a
full-time position.
But although Gurley termed the
Harris departure "a very serious loss,"
and several students indicated a desire
that he stay, the chances of the latter

appear slim.
"I've had several talks with him
[Harris], and I believe that we are in
agreement on the general conditions
under which he would like to be
considered," explained Abramovitz.
He further noted the conditions deal
with "a positive faculty commitment
in Marxian economics," and agreed
under such conditions Harris "might
emerge as a leading candidate for
appointment."
He added, however, "these

economics as a field: it's a series of
ideas which permeate the whole
structure of economics."
Abramovitz confessed there seemed
little likelihood of hiring full-time
faculty. Abramovitz explained two
professors would possibly be half of all
the faculty to be hired in the next two
years. If student interest warrants
more faculty, he continued, a visitor
would be located. But he didn't

consider one quarter sufficient
experience, he said.
Further, he called the proposed
criterion of "working in and
sympathetic to Marxian economics" a
"dangerous" one. He called Marxism
in part "a political ideology," adding
"demands for an ideologically or
politically balanced faculty are likely
to follow." But Gurley and Harris
both criticized this reasoning.
Opinions differ on causes of and
solutions to program disputes
currently plaguing the Economics
Department. The controversies
primarily concern student requests
that the department make a firmer
commitment to a program in radical
political economics.
Student dissatisfaction with current
department programs in Marxist
economics, and with limited faculty
trained in the field, has been
exacerbated by the pending departure
of visiting professor Donald Harris,
one of two Marxian economists
currently in the department. The other
is John Gurley.
According to Economics
Department Chairman Moses
Abramovitz, the most recent student
requests came in the form of petitions
drafted by the Union for Radical
Political Economics (URPE) chapter
here, signed by 208 undergraduate and
over 50 graduate students from various
departments, and delivered to the
department shortly before Christmas.
Department members met with
interested students to discuss these
problems at a public meeting a week
ago. A meeting concentrating on the
undergraduate aspects of the problem
will be held at 2:30 on Feb. 1 in TMU
270.
Radical Field
The petitions contained three
requests: that the department make a
"formal commitment" to its program
in Marxian economics; that it support
this field by maintaining a staff of
three economists — a full professor, an
associate professor, and an assistant
professor — "working in and
sympathetic to" the field; and that the
faculty recommend offering Harris a
full-time position.
But although Gurley termed the
Harris departure "a very serious loss,"
and several students indicated a desire
that he stay, the chances of the latter

appear slim.
"I've had several talks with him
[Harris], and I believe that we are in
agreement on the general conditions
under which he would like to be
considered," explained Abramovitz.
He further noted the conditions deal
with "a positive faculty commitment
in Marxian economics," and agreed
under such conditions Harris "might
emerge as a leading candidate for
appointment."
He added, however, "these
conditions don't yet exist. They're
exactly the issues that are now before
the faculty." The faculty meets today
to consider the requests.
Harris Return Unlikely
Harris, who returns after this year
to a tenured position at the University
of Wisconsin, admitted chances of his
remaining are slim. "I have no great
anxiety or desire to remain here," he
confessed, adding he hasn't "been
terribly excited at Stanford."
He explained he "would like to see
serious intellectual or scholarly
interest here [at Stanford] consistent
with my own interests," although
adding "the possibility doesn't exist
here at the moment." Harris, a black,
further explained he desired "to link
up with serious research" of black
scholars applying system analysis to
problems of blacks throughout the
world, but "the University is not
prepared to develop that." He has not
been approached about remaining
here, he concluded.
The question of the department's
"commitment" to a broader program
in Marxian economics also evoked
varied responses. Abramovitz noted
the department had established a
"graduate field" in radical political
economics on a trial basis in response
to URPE requests last year.
Graduate students in the
department must pass comprehensive
examinations in three to five such
"fields" before receiving a degree, and

Abramovitz pointed out "a certain
tentative air" always surrounds new
fields.
He explained the department had
emphasized the trial nature of the
field, because it had been established
after student requests, and the
department hadn't wanted the
students to feel there was "an
unalterable commitment" to it.
Abramovitz Hesitant
But although he admitted "student
interest" and its "importance" as
"part of a liberal education justify at
least some additional offerings,"
Abramovitz maintained the
department needed more experience
before it could consider hiring
additional faculty.
