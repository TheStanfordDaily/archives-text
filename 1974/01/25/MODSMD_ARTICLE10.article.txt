# Getting Serious For Once
## Micks, GPA, And A Stanford Diploma 
### 
» Jerry Coleman

Alas, the time has come to take pen
in hand and compose my final column.
Others should have this precious
chance to wash their literary
underwear in full view of a 23,000
person readership. That about sums
my feeling on the matter; anything
else would be wasted verbiage, and in
this business, space is at a premium.
So IH utilize this last allotment of
space and exercise my columnist's
privilege to be — for once in three
years — serious and personally
reflective. (If you're still looking for
raunchy humor, then either read
elsewhere or tune in my radio show.)
A little background needs be set.
Late in my senior year of high school,
I participated in an area-wide academic
competition with a choice monetary
prize. Many of you must have gone
through similar screenings to e&rn
prize money prior to college, for we
do make up some sort of collegiate
elite, and the elite usually win such
honors.
This competition involved two
panel discussions on non-rehearsed
topics, with increasing amounts of
money going to the best talker in the
group. (I don't want to portray a
quiz-show image; it was, rather,
seriously scholastic.)
Strategy
Throughout my panel
participations, I maintained a very
detached 'strategic' attitude:
evaluating every word said in terms of
its potential effect on the eventual fate
of the speaker, including myself. What
I spoke about the topic was motivated
more in terms of winning than in
terms of any enthusiasm over the

subject, and that in spite of my being
originally chosen to*compete for my
proficiency in and liking of the field.
The second and third place winners at
each level spoke well, but also seemed
truly involved with their verbal
sentiments: between panel's end and
judging results they continued heated
talk on the topic.
For reasons known only to them,
the judges saw fit to bestow upon me
the first place slot and its attendant
monetary reward. I didn't really stop
to examine my attitude during the
discussions until much later, and even
then I thought it to be limited merely
to the rigors of competition.
Besides, I was about to embark
upon a four year adventure at
Stanford, where the
jo k e-1 h a t- was-senior-year-high-school
would disappear in the face of real
intellectual pursuits — enthusiastic
pursuits. Just before college, a second
event in my life took place that was to
have relevance on this entire topic.
Alumni Social
I attended a Stanford alumni
get-together in my home town
designed to mingle new frosh with
seasoned old timers who could provide
advice, anecdotes, and assurance — a
sort of walking, talking 'Approaching
Stanford' with built-in bar. One
confident sophomore herded a gaggle
of us, screwdrivers in hand, over by
the pool (there has to be a pool at a
Stanford get-together) and told us all
about succeeding academically on the
farm.
"You can get a B in any class
without trying," were his words — I
remember them exactly. "Try Prof.

So-and-so: he's a funny guy and it's an
easy A. And remember when you
graduate that you have a Stanford
diploma in your hands."
I was slightly disgusted. What a
waste of money, effort, and time to go
to Stanford for easy grades and a
diploma. Where's the challenge, the
enthusiasm, the sense of intellectual
accomplishment?
Original Accomplishment
Fortunately, my freshman courses
pushed me to think, to be challenged,
to be enthusiastic. And feeling so, I
was able to produce some of the first
really original papers I'd ever done.
Most of you must have shared the real
sense of original accomplishment at
such times and with such work in
hand.
So I forgot both the high school
competition and the advice of the
summer's-end sophomore. For a time.
But now, toward the end of my
tenure here, I'm beset by doubts and
memories. I see many around me, so
intent on boosting a respectable GPA
for grad school, that they take the
easy courses; they forestall today's
challenge in order to guarantee their
admission to an institution of future
challenges.
I see those concerned with 'not
letting their classes get in the way of
their education;' the amenities here on
the farm are certainly tempting.
I am distressed at the thought that
such behavior may also be mine. I
definitely don't make a practice of
taking micks or much time off; my
friends say I study to excess. Perhaps,
but my attitude has quarrels with the
work that always does get done.

I don't take easy A courses, but
neither have I taken any real heavies
lately. And when I find myself with
over 16 books to read I worry
excessively over their effect on my
health.
Enthusiasm Waned
I still am challenged, but I've lost
some enthusiasm for the challenge: in
some subjects it's become a burden
rather than a privilege. In short, I now
enter some discussions geared toward
some uncertain reward, not for a love
of the topic at hand.
There's no cash reward these days,
except in the indirect sense of a salary
from a job after graduation; perhaps a
more tangible benefit is professorial
approval. But at times, when that is
received it seems hollowly won.
On top of that, life here is mellow,
easy. Why give it up for the cruel
world beyond the red tile? Is that the
proper attitude or an immature
indulgence?
Well there it is: I'm troubled at
times. But big deal really; if I've struck
a respondant chord in you, good;
others of you can read this and easily
call me arrogant, self-indulgent,
perhaps a waste of your time.
In any case, I've said enough. After
three years of columns, I've certainly
said enough. Some of you write
columns now: be funny if you can and
try to hold ali the hot air that fills
these pages in a satiric sense, OK?
Good. Good.
