## Prosecutor Leon Jaworski's Background 
### 
Bill Evers

A look at the background of special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski will help us understand
the decisions he makes in the months ahead.
Examining Jaworski's background also gives us an
indication of the sort of men who are important
decision-makers in America today.
Since the early 19505, Jaworski has been a
member of the board of trustees of a CIA conduit,
the M.D. Anderson Foundation. This foundation
was set up by its namesake, a partner in Anderson,
Clayton and Company. Anderson Clayton grew in
the first half of the twentieth century into the
largest cotton exporting concern in the world, with
operations around the globe. The other partner in
the concern's name is Will Clayton, who as Assistant
Secretary of State for Economic Affairs was an
architect of America's early Cold War policies.
Jaworski sits on the board of the foundation
because Anderson Clayton is a most important
client of his law firm, Fulbright, Crooker &
Jaworski. The firm is one of the largest in the nation
with 149 partners and associates and has branches in
Washington, D.C. and Mexico City. Jaworski is the
leading figure in the firm and has for many years
been the chairman of its executive committee. The
New York Times said of Jaworski, on November 4,
1973, "His Houston law firm ... represents bankers
and big business, and his political loyalties have
never strayed far from those of his clients."
In 1967, in the wake of disclosures about CIA
subsidies to the U.S. National Student Association,
it was learned that the M.D. Anderson Foundation
had also been a CIA conduit. During the late 1950s
and early 19605, the foundation had channeled
more than $60,000 to a legal organization known as
the American Fund for Free Jurists.
CIA Tie Approved
In November 1973, the Associated Press
interviewed John Freeman, the president of the
Anderson Foundation. Freeman maintained that he,
Jaworski, and the two other foundation trustees had
unanimously approved the relationship with the
CIA, and that Jaworski was aware of the details over
the years.
Jaworski is in Washington supervising evaluation

of campaign practices in the 1972 national election.
He has had recent intimate contact himself with the
world of campaign contributions and in a way that
illustrates the key role of the corporate lawyer in
the amalgamation of big business with the
government.
Before Jaworski went to Washington, he served
as campaign manager for the Houston Community
Improvement Committee's unsuccessful attempt to
get a mass transit bond issue approved by the city's
voters. Mass transit is an ideological favorite of
corporate liberals as well as directly benefiting the
urban business interests that generally support
corporate liberal policies.
Illegal Disclosures
Houston's Community Improvement Committee
spent $107,162 in an effort to persuade the
electorate to back the bond issue, and as of the
committee's final report, $50,054 of that money
was illegally reported under the new Texas law on
campaign contribution disclosure. The committee is
a civic development organization to which,
according to the Texas Observer, "rich Houstonians
and/or their companies regularly contribute." A
survey conducted by Common Cause showed that
22 percent of the committee's contributors are
contractors and another 20 percent are construction
companies. This civic organization was able to
promote $280 million worth of construction
projects in 1973.
Jaworski is quite a commanding figure in legal
circles. He was a long-time friend and counsel to
President Lyndon Johnson. He was a Texas
representative on the staff of the Warren
Commission that investigated the assassination of
President John Kennedy.
Jaworski is a past president of the American Bar
Association, the lawyers' cartel. It is a cartel, not
unlike the guilds of the middle ages, in the sense
that through cooperation with the government it
restricts the production of legal services and thus
raises the prices for them. It does this in part
through the bar examination limiting entry into
legal practice, through prohibiting general
advertising by lawyers, and through prohibiting

public notice of the specialties of lawyers.
Big-Firm Lawyers
In describing the present-day ABA, David Ray
Papke notes that it is characterized by 'the
dominance of big-firm corporate lawyers, who are
most numerous in the East but to be found in every
large city.. .. The big-firm corporate lawyers are
the association's most influential members. Not all
of them are liberal, they do have a certain 'national'
outlook." The work done by Jaworski's firm makes
it just the sort of local carbon-copy of an Eastern
Establishment Firm that Papke is writing about.
In addition, it is increasingly difficult to tell
where the ABA leaves off and the government
begins. As part of the merging of important
institutions in the corporate state, the activities of
the ABA are now heavily financed by tax funds and
by foundation grants, as opposed to membership
dues. In fact, when Jaworski left the presidency of
the ABA in fall 1972, he described the organization
as a "quasi-public institution."
In sum, Jaworski is a man accustomed to
applying his talents in the circles of leading
decision-makers, and his history as a corporate
lawyer gives us insight into what his values are and
practices will be.

the concern's name is Will Clayton, who as Assistant
Secretary of State for Economic Affairs was an
architect of America's early Cold War policies.
Jaworski sits on the board of the foundation
because Anderson Clayton is a most important
client of his law firm, Fulbright, Crooker &
Jaworski. The firm is one of the largest in the nation
with 149 partners and associates and has branches in
Washington, D.C. and Mexico City. Jaworski is the
leading figure in the firm and has for many years
been the chairman of its executive committee. The
New York Times said of Jaworski, on November 4,
1973, "His Houston law firm ... represents bankers
and big business, and his political loyalties have
never strayed far from those of his clients."
In 1967, in the wake of disclosures about CIA
subsidies to the U.S. National Student Association,
it was learned that the M.D. Anderson Foundation
had also been a CIA conduit. During the late 1950s
and early 19605, the foundation had channeled
more than $60,000 to a legal organization known as
the American Fund for Free Jurists.
CIA Tie Approved
In November 1973, the Associated Press
interviewed John Freeman, the president of the
Anderson Foundation. Freeman maintained that he,
Jaworski, and the two other foundation trustees had
unanimously approved the relationship with the
CIA, and that Jaworski was aware of the details over
the years.
Jaworski is in Washington supervising evaluation

of campaign practices in the 1972 national election.
He has had recent intimate contact himself with the
world of campaign contributions and in a way that
illustrates the key role of the corporate lawyer in
the amalgamation of big business with the
government.
Before Jaworski went to Washington, he served
as campaign manager for the Houston Community
Improvement Committee's unsuccessful attempt to
get a mass transit bond issue approved by the city's
voters. Mass transit is an ideological favorite of
corporate liberals as well as directly benefiting the
urban business interests that generally support
corporate liberal policies.
Illegal Disclosures
Houston's Community Improvement Committee
spent $107,162 in an effort to persuade the
electorate to back the bond issue, and as of the
committee's final report, $50,054 of that money
was illegally reported under the new Texas law on
campaign contribution disclosure. The committee is
a civic development organization to which,
according to the Texas Observer, "rich Houstonians
and/or their companies regularly contribute." A
survey conducted by Common Cause showed that
22 percent of the committee's contributors are
contractors and another 20 percent are construction
companies. This civic organization was able to
promote $280 million worth of construction
projects in 1973.
Jaworski is quite a commanding figure in legal
circles. He was a long-time friend and counsel to
President Lyndon Johnson. He was a Texas
representative on the staff of the Warren
Commission that investigated the assassination of
President John Kennedy.
Jaworski is a past president of the American Bar
Association, the lawyers' cartel. It is a cartel, not
unlike the guilds of the middle ages, in the sense
that through cooperation with the government it
restricts the production of legal services and thus
raises the prices for them. It does this in part
through the bar examination limiting entry into
legal practice, through prohibiting general
advertising by lawyers, and through prohibiting

public notice of the specialties of lawyers.
Big-Firm Lawyers
In describing the present-day ABA, David Ray
Papke notes that it is characterized by 'the
dominance of big-firm corporate lawyers, who are
most numerous in the East but to be found in every
large city.. .. The big-firm corporate lawyers are
the association's most influential members. Not all
of them are liberal, they do have a certain 'national'
outlook." The work done by Jaworski's firm makes
it just the sort of local carbon-copy of an Eastern
Establishment Firm that Papke is writing about.
In addition, it is increasingly difficult to tell
where the ABA leaves off and the government
begins. As part of the merging of important
institutions in the corporate state, the activities of
the ABA are now heavily financed by tax funds and
by foundation grants, as opposed to membership
dues. In fact, when Jaworski left the presidency of
the ABA in fall 1972, he described the organization
as a "quasi-public institution."
In sum, Jaworski is a man accustomed to
applying his talents in the circles of leading
decision-makers, and his history as a corporate
lawyer gives us insight into what his values are and
practices will be.

and big business, and his political loyalties have
never strayed far from those of his clients."
In 1967, in the wake of disclosures about CIA
subsidies to the U.S. National Student Association,
it was learned that the M.D. Anderson Foundation
had also been a CIA conduit. During the late 1950s
and early 19605, the foundation had channeled
more than $60,000 to a legal organization known as
the American Fund for Free Jurists.
CIA Tie Approved
In November 1973, the Associated Press
interviewed John Freeman, the president of the
Anderson Foundation. Freeman maintained that he,
Jaworski, and the two other foundation trustees had
unanimously approved the relationship with the
CIA, and that Jaworski was aware of the details over
the years.
Jaworski is in Washington supervising evaluation

of campaign practices in the 1972 national election.
He has had recent intimate contact himself with the
world of campaign contributions and in a way that
illustrates the key role of the corporate lawyer in
the amalgamation of big business with the
government.
Before Jaworski went to Washington, he served
as campaign manager for the Houston Community
Improvement Committee's unsuccessful attempt to
get a mass transit bond issue approved by the city's
voters. Mass transit is an ideological favorite of
corporate liberals as well as directly benefiting the
urban business interests that generally support
corporate liberal policies.
Illegal Disclosures
Houston's Community Improvement Committee
spent $107,162 in an effort to persuade the
electorate to back the bond issue, and as of the
committee's final report, $50,054 of that money
was illegally reported under the new Texas law on
campaign contribution disclosure. The committee is
a civic development organization to which,
according to the Texas Observer, "rich Houstonians
and/or their companies regularly contribute." A
survey conducted by Common Cause showed that
22 percent of the committee's contributors are
contractors and another 20 percent are construction
companies. This civic organization was able to
promote $280 million worth of construction
projects in 1973.
Jaworski is quite a commanding figure in legal
circles. He was a long-time friend and counsel to
President Lyndon Johnson. He was a Texas
representative on the staff of the Warren
Commission that investigated the assassination of
President John Kennedy.
Jaworski is a past president of the American Bar
Association, the lawyers' cartel. It is a cartel, not
unlike the guilds of the middle ages, in the sense
that through cooperation with the government it
restricts the production of legal services and thus
raises the prices for them. It does this in part
through the bar examination limiting entry into
legal practice, through prohibiting general
advertising by lawyers, and through prohibiting

public notice of the specialties of lawyers.
Big-Firm Lawyers
In describing the present-day ABA, David Ray
Papke notes that it is characterized by 'the
dominance of big-firm corporate lawyers, who are
most numerous in the East but to be found in every
large city.. .. The big-firm corporate lawyers are
the association's most influential members. Not all
of them are liberal, they do have a certain 'national'
outlook." The work done by Jaworski's firm makes
it just the sort of local carbon-copy of an Eastern
Establishment Firm that Papke is writing about.
In addition, it is increasingly difficult to tell
where the ABA leaves off and the government
begins. As part of the merging of important
institutions in the corporate state, the activities of
the ABA are now heavily financed by tax funds and
by foundation grants, as opposed to membership
dues. In fact, when Jaworski left the presidency of
the ABA in fall 1972, he described the organization
as a "quasi-public institution."
In sum, Jaworski is a man accustomed to
applying his talents in the circles of leading
decision-makers, and his history as a corporate
lawyer gives us insight into what his values are and
practices will be.

A look at the background of special Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski will help us understand
the decisions he makes in the months ahead.
Examining Jaworski's background also gives us an
indication of the sort of men who are important
decision-makers in America today.
Since the early 19505, Jaworski has been a
member of the board of trustees of a CIA conduit,
the M.D. Anderson Foundation. This foundation
was set up by its namesake, a partner in Anderson,
Clayton and Company. Anderson Clayton grew in
the first half of the twentieth century into the
largest cotton exporting concern in the world, with
operations around the globe. The other partner in
the concern's name is Will Clayton, who as Assistant
Secretary of State for Economic Affairs was an
architect of America's early Cold War policies.
Jaworski sits on the board of the foundation
because Anderson Clayton is a most important
client of his law firm, Fulbright, Crooker &
Jaworski. The firm is one of the largest in the nation
with 149 partners and associates and has branches in
Washington, D.C. and Mexico City. Jaworski is the
leading figure in the firm and has for many years
been the chairman of its executive committee. The
New York Times said of Jaworski, on November 4,
1973, "His Houston law firm ... represents bankers
and big business, and his political loyalties have
