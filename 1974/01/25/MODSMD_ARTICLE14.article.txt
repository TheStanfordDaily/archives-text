# Prof Explores The Complexities Of Sleep
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
While most people sleep or slave over physics
problems, a dedicated few stay up through the long
night studying the phenomena of sleep. One of the
leading researchers in this field is Dr. William C.
Dement, professor of psychiatry and the creator of
Psychology 157, 'Sleep and Dreams.'
Dement sees sleep as a "complex, vital function
which is almost totally ignored by medicine." He
feels that there may be 20 million people in the
United States with sleep problems, and that "it is
time for something to be on medical school
curriculums concerning sleep."
The area of sleep and dreams research has
remained largely unexplored because, as Dement
said good-humoredly, "no one wants to stay up to
do it."
But Dement did. He has always been fascinated
by the way the brain functions and the change
from wakefulness to sleep. "It's incredible. How do
these ten billion neurons make you awake, and
suddenly, everything changes?"
"When REM [Rapid Eye Movement] — dream
sleep — was discovered, the basic question it raised
was: 'Just what is direaming and what are its
functions?' "
To find out about this phenomenon, Dement
makes use of a polygraph machine, attaching
painless electrodes to the face and head of an
animal or human. The machine records brain, eye,
and muscle waves without disturbing sleep. While
the subject slumbers peacefully in one room, the
researcher may measure and classify sleep patterns
in the next room.
"I always had the fantasy of having a sleep lab
with a hundred bedrooms," Dement confessed.
While serving as faculty resident at Cedro House in
1970, Dement "wanted something to do with the
house," and hit upon the idea of setting up such an
experiment with student participation. He says he
"would have wired up the whole dorm" if he could
have, but never did.
However, Dement did manage to gain access to
the Wilbur basement, where students could set up
their own experiments. The interest which grew out
of this project led to the course which he now
teaches on the subject.
This summer, Dement's dream of a giant sleep
lab came true when residents of Lambda Nu
participated in a sleep medication experiment
testing the effectiveness of a sleeping pill. Results

from observations of 22 subjects for 19 consecutive
nights proved the medicine did work. Dement said
that the smoothness of his massive experiment
pleased him.
Dement's research, which began in 1952 under
Nathaniel Kleitman, has contradicted many
commonly held notions about dreams. Freud said
that dreams existed to provide a safety valve for the
fulfillment of an indestructible instinctual drive,
such as hunger or sex. He contended that dreams
served as the "guardian of sleep" in that their
stories disguised unacceptable wishes which, if not
modified during sleep, would cause enough anxiety
to cause arousal from sleep.
The regularity of dreaming which Dement found
did not support this theory, nor did his finding that
people almost invariably wake up briefly during a
dream period.
Dement also disproved " 'cheese and pickle
school'" theory that gastro-intestinal distress
brought on by eating causes dreams. He found that
the dreaming cycle begins approximately every
ninety minutes, regardless of what the subject has
eaten.
Present concerns of Dement and other sleep
researchers include narcolepsy, insomnia,
hypersomnia, and sleep apnea.
Narcolepsy, a disorder which makes the sufferer
susceptible to 'attacks' of sleep, occurs especially
when he or she becomes anxious or excited.
Monique, a narcoleptic poodle in one of Dement's
labs, will keel over in a narcoleptic fit of happiness
if given something to eat.
Hypersomnia is the ailment of too much sleep.
According to Dement, to consider the brain asleep
or awake, it "has to do something. In hypersomnia,
it just doesn't make the effort." A simple test of
pushing a button upon seeing a bright flash of light,
elicits 100 percent accurate responses from normal
subjects. But the hypersomniac may miss the brief
flash because of a "microsleep."
The sleep apnea sufferer may not sleep and
breathe at the same time, possibly due to high
blood pressure. Consequently, he must wake up
hundreds of times a night to get enough air to stay
alive.
Dement and his colleagues have much to
explore. Tonight when you collapse into bed,
remember the title of Dement's book, a quote from
Hamlet: "Some must watch, while some must
sleep," and remember those who have chosen the
first alternative.

pushing a button upon seeing a bright flash of light,
elicits 100 percent accurate responses from normal
subjects. But the hypersomniac may miss the brief
flash because of a "microsleep."
The sleep apnea sufferer may not sleep and
breathe at the same time, possibly due to high
blood pressure. Consequently, he must wake up
hundreds of times a night to get enough air to stay
alive.
Dement and his colleagues have much to
explore. Tonight when you collapse into bed,
remember the title of Dement's book, a quote from
Hamlet: "Some must watch, while some must
sleep," and remember those who have chosen the
first alternative.

While most people sleep or slave over physics
problems, a dedicated few stay up through the long
night studying the phenomena of sleep. One of the
leading researchers in this field is Dr. William C.
Dement, professor of psychiatry and the creator of
Psychology 157, 'Sleep and Dreams.'
Dement sees sleep as a "complex, vital function
which is almost totally ignored by medicine." He
feels that there may be 20 million people in the
United States with sleep problems, and that "it is
time for something to be on medical school
curriculums concerning sleep."
The area of sleep and dreams research has
remained largely unexplored because, as Dement
said good-humoredly, "no one wants to stay up to
do it."
But Dement did. He has always been fascinated
by the way the brain functions and the change
from wakefulness to sleep. "It's incredible. How do
these ten billion neurons make you awake, and
suddenly, everything changes?"
"When REM [Rapid Eye Movement] — dream
sleep — was discovered, the basic question it raised
was: 'Just what is direaming and what are its
functions?' "
To find out about this phenomenon, Dement
makes use of a polygraph machine, attaching
painless electrodes to the face and head of an
animal or human. The machine records brain, eye,
and muscle waves without disturbing sleep. While
the subject slumbers peacefully in one room, the
researcher may measure and classify sleep patterns
in the next room.
"I always had the fantasy of having a sleep lab
with a hundred bedrooms," Dement confessed.
While serving as faculty resident at Cedro House in
1970, Dement "wanted something to do with the
house," and hit upon the idea of setting up such an
experiment with student participation. He says he
"would have wired up the whole dorm" if he could
have, but never did.
However, Dement did manage to gain access to
the Wilbur basement, where students could set up
their own experiments. The interest which grew out
of this project led to the course which he now
teaches on the subject.
This summer, Dement's dream of a giant sleep
lab came true when residents of Lambda Nu
participated in a sleep medication experiment
testing the effectiveness of a sleeping pill. Results

from observations of 22 subjects for 19 consecutive
nights proved the medicine did work. Dement said
that the smoothness of his massive experiment
pleased him.
Dement's research, which began in 1952 under
Nathaniel Kleitman, has contradicted many
commonly held notions about dreams. Freud said
that dreams existed to provide a safety valve for the
fulfillment of an indestructible instinctual drive,
such as hunger or sex. He contended that dreams
served as the "guardian of sleep" in that their
stories disguised unacceptable wishes which, if not
modified during sleep, would cause enough anxiety
to cause arousal from sleep.
The regularity of dreaming which Dement found
did not support this theory, nor did his finding that
people almost invariably wake up briefly during a
dream period.
Dement also disproved " 'cheese and pickle
school'" theory that gastro-intestinal distress
brought on by eating causes dreams. He found that
the dreaming cycle begins approximately every
ninety minutes, regardless of what the subject has
eaten.
Present concerns of Dement and other sleep
researchers include narcolepsy, insomnia,
hypersomnia, and sleep apnea.
Narcolepsy, a disorder which makes the sufferer
susceptible to 'attacks' of sleep, occurs especially
when he or she becomes anxious or excited.
Monique, a narcoleptic poodle in one of Dement's
labs, will keel over in a narcoleptic fit of happiness
if given something to eat.
Hypersomnia is the ailment of too much sleep.
According to Dement, to consider the brain asleep
or awake, it "has to do something. In hypersomnia,
it just doesn't make the effort." A simple test of
pushing a button upon seeing a bright flash of light,
elicits 100 percent accurate responses from normal
subjects. But the hypersomniac may miss the brief

did not support this theory, nor did his finding that
people almost invariably wake up briefly during a
dream period.
Dement also disproved " 'cheese and pickle
school'" theory that gastro-intestinal distress
brought on by eating causes dreams. He found that
the dreaming cycle begins approximately every
ninety minutes, regardless of what the subject has
eaten.
Present concerns of Dement and other sleep
researchers include narcolepsy, insomnia,
hypersomnia, and sleep apnea.
Narcolepsy, a disorder which makes the sufferer
susceptible to 'attacks' of sleep, occurs especially
when he or she becomes anxious or excited.
Monique, a narcoleptic poodle in one of Dement's
labs, will keel over in a narcoleptic fit of happiness
if given something to eat.
Hypersomnia is the ailment of too much sleep.
According to Dement, to consider the brain asleep
or awake, it "has to do something. In hypersomnia,
it just doesn't make the effort." A simple test of
pushing a button upon seeing a bright flash of light,
elicits 100 percent accurate responses from normal
subjects. But the hypersomniac may miss the brief
flash because of a "microsleep."
The sleep apnea sufferer may not sleep and
breathe at the same time, possibly due to high
blood pressure. Consequently, he must wake up
hundreds of times a night to get enough air to stay
alive.
Dement and his colleagues have much to
explore. Tonight when you collapse into bed,
remember the title of Dement's book, a quote from
Hamlet: "Some must watch, while some must
sleep," and remember those who have chosen the
first alternative.

While most people sleep or slave over physics
problems, a dedicated few stay up through the long
night studying the phenomena of sleep. One of the
leading researchers in this field is Dr. William C.
Dement, professor of psychiatry and the creator of
Psychology 157, 'Sleep and Dreams.'
Dement sees sleep as a "complex, vital function
which is almost totally ignored by medicine." He
feels that there may be 20 million people in the
United States with sleep problems, and that "it is
time for something to be on medical school
curriculums concerning sleep."
The area of sleep and dreams research has
remained largely unexplored because, as Dement
said good-humoredly, "no one wants to stay up to
do it."
But Dement did. He has always been fascinated
by the way the brain functions and the change
from wakefulness to sleep. "It's incredible. How do
these ten billion neurons make you awake, and
suddenly, everything changes?"
"When REM [Rapid Eye Movement] — dream
sleep — was discovered, the basic question it raised
was: 'Just what is direaming and what are its
functions?' "
To find out about this phenomenon, Dement
makes use of a polygraph machine, attaching
painless electrodes to the face and head of an
animal or human. The machine records brain, eye,
and muscle waves without disturbing sleep. While
the subject slumbers peacefully in one room, the
researcher may measure and classify sleep patterns
in the next room.
"I always had the fantasy of having a sleep lab
with a hundred bedrooms," Dement confessed.
While serving as faculty resident at Cedro House in
1970, Dement "wanted something to do with the
house," and hit upon the idea of setting up such an
experiment with student participation. He says he
"would have wired up the whole dorm" if he could
have, but never did.
However, Dement did manage to gain access to
the Wilbur basement, where students could set up
their own experiments. The interest which grew out
of this project led to the course which he now
teaches on the subject.
This summer, Dement's dream of a giant sleep
lab came true when residents of Lambda Nu
participated in a sleep medication experiment
testing the effectiveness of a sleeping pill. Results

from observations of 22 subjects for 19 consecutive
nights proved the medicine did work. Dement said
that the smoothness of his massive experiment
pleased him.
Dement's research, which began in 1952 under
Nathaniel Kleitman, has contradicted many
commonly held notions about dreams. Freud said
that dreams existed to provide a safety valve for the
fulfillment of an indestructible instinctual drive,
such as hunger or sex. He contended that dreams
served as the "guardian of sleep" in that their
stories disguised unacceptable wishes which, if not
modified during sleep, would cause enough anxiety
to cause arousal from sleep.
The regularity of dreaming which Dement found
did not support this theory, nor did his finding that
people almost invariably wake up briefly during a
dream period.
Dement also disproved " 'cheese and pickle
school'" theory that gastro-intestinal distress
brought on by eating causes dreams. He found that
the dreaming cycle begins approximately every
