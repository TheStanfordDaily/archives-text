# Four-Part Series
## Women's Roles Discussed 
### 
By WENDY QUINONES
"I want to make people aware
that women's situations are
different in different parts of the
world," says Ann Burrell, post
doctoral fellow in Biology who
came to Stanford from her native
Britain slightly over a year ago.
Burrell introduced the
four-part series "Man's
World/Woman's Place, Women's
World/Man's Place" which began
last night in the International
Center. An exploration of
women's roles in various societies,
last night's presentation also
featured skits, a panel discussion
by Indonesian men and women,
and the third act of "Dona Rosita,

While She Waits," put on by
members of the Drama
Department.
Greater Need
"The women's liberation
movement is much bigger and
more aggressive in the United
States than in England," says
Burrell, "and I assume that's
because the need is greater. If
there's discrimination against
women in professional circles in
England, it's much more subtle.
Here, I'm made very aware of
being a woman, and of a general
feeling that therefore I have to
prove myself."
Esther Antonucci, an Italian
physicist studying here on a
European fellowship, agrees. Her

situation as the only woman in
her working group is quite
different than it was in Italy,
where about 30 percent of all
scientists are women.
"At home, I felt that my
colleagues treated me like one of
them," she says. "But here, for
the first time I realized that I was
different from the others because
I am a woman."
Both Sides
The situation creates problems
on both sides, according to
Antonucci. "It's hard for the men
too, because they've never had a
woman to work with. They don't
know how to act towards me,"
she says.
Antonucci will coordinate a
fliture program in the
International Center series on the
topic of combining professional
and family responsibilities.
Attempts to communalize
family responsibilities, which have
begun in Germany and Italy,
particularly interest her. "If a
woman is married," Antonucci
says, "she can't produce at the
same level as a man. That's one
area of discrimination that hasn't
been resolved, because marriage
doesn't affect a man that way."
Women In Italy
Both Antonucci and Burrell
agree that their international
experience has changed them. "In
Italy, there's really nothing to be
liberated from,"says Antonucci.
Like Burrell, she has little interest
in the women's movement itself.
"But here," she continues,
"I'm more concerned with the
problems, and how different
people solve them."
Burrell's experience is similar.
"In England, I was a student, not
a professional, and I wondered
what all the fuss was about. But
I'll be more sensitive to these
issues when I go back home."
Future programs in the
International Center series are
tentatively scheduled for Feb. 4
or 7, Feb. 21, and March 7 at 8
p.m.

Burrell introduced the
four-part series "Man's
World/Woman's Place, Women's
World/Man's Place" which began
last night in the International
Center. An exploration of
women's roles in various societies,
last night's presentation also
featured skits, a panel discussion
by Indonesian men and women,
and the third act of "Dona Rosita,

While She Waits," put on by
members of the Drama
Department.
Greater Need
"The women's liberation
movement is much bigger and
more aggressive in the United
States than in England," says
Burrell, "and I assume that's
because the need is greater. If
there's discrimination against
women in professional circles in
England, it's much more subtle.
Here, I'm made very aware of
being a woman, and of a general
feeling that therefore I have to
prove myself."
Esther Antonucci, an Italian
physicist studying here on a
European fellowship, agrees. Her

situation as the only woman in
her working group is quite
different than it was in Italy,
where about 30 percent of all
scientists are women.
"At home, I felt that my
colleagues treated me like one of
them," she says. "But here, for
the first time I realized that I was
different from the others because
I am a woman."
Both Sides
The situation creates problems
on both sides, according to
Antonucci. "It's hard for the men
too, because they've never had a
woman to work with. They don't
know how to act towards me,"
she says.
Antonucci will coordinate a
fliture program in the
International Center series on the
topic of combining professional
and family responsibilities.
Attempts to communalize
family responsibilities, which have
begun in Germany and Italy,
particularly interest her. "If a
woman is married," Antonucci
says, "she can't produce at the
same level as a man. That's one
area of discrimination that hasn't
been resolved, because marriage
doesn't affect a man that way."
Women In Italy
Both Antonucci and Burrell
agree that their international
experience has changed them. "In
Italy, there's really nothing to be
liberated from,"says Antonucci.
Like Burrell, she has little interest
in the women's movement itself.
"But here," she continues,
"I'm more concerned with the
problems, and how different
people solve them."
Burrell's experience is similar.
"In England, I was a student, not
a professional, and I wondered
what all the fuss was about. But
I'll be more sensitive to these
issues when I go back home."
Future programs in the
International Center series are
tentatively scheduled for Feb. 4
or 7, Feb. 21, and March 7 at 8
p.m.
