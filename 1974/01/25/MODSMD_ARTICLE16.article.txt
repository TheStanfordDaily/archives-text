# Radio Free Speech Program

### ANNE CUSICK 
"Opinion 74" a new free
speech program on campus radio
station KZSU, will provide
students, faculty and area
residents with free air time to
voice their opinions on issues of
their choosing.
Junior Kathy Cunningham,
producer of the program, said the
idea for the broadcasts stemmed
from efforts by the Committee
for Open Media (COM). The
group, which included several
Stanford students, last year asked
Bay Area television and radio
stations to allow free speech air
time for listeners to voice their
views during prime time.
Some stations complied with
the COM free speech proposal.
But Cunningham pointed out that
"there are very few radio stations
with programs such as this, and
we feel that KZSU is a prime
place that will fill the need for
public access to the media in the
area."
Cunningham, a communication
student, has read numerous
articles supporting the case for
free speech programming. Under
the slogan "People Time In
Broadcasting," she noted, there is
growing interest in public use of
the time provided to voice
personal opinions on local, state
and federal issues.
"KZSU is owned by Stanford
and licensed as an educational

station, so the staff cannot
editorialize," she said. "Therefore
it is made very clear before and
after the broadcast that the
opinion was that of the speaker
only and not of Stanford or
KZSU."
Cunningham said "Opinion
'74" will welcome any responsible
opinions from students, faculty
and citizens outside the
University. But she warned that
"there are FCC [Federal
Communications Commission]
rulings against the use of criminal
obscenity, libelous statements or
incitements to violence.
"We will solicit both sides of
the issues, although we are not
required to," she added.
