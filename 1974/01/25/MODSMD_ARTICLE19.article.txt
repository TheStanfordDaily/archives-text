# Solzhenitsyn Seeks Freedom Of Expression
## Soviet Writer Faces Political Harassment 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - "Papa who
was Leonid Brezhnev?" a Russian
boy asks his father in the 21st
century.
"I think he was a politician
who lived during the Solzhenitsyn
era," says his father.
This anecdote is told among
some Russian intellectuals. It
illustrates their confidence that
the name of novelist Alexander
Solzhenitsyn will survive far
longer than those of the people
currently harassing him.
In the West, too, the 1970
Nobel laureate has a large
following, and his name has
become a symbol of towering
literary talent, of heroic struggle
for freedom of expression.
Lack Of Understanding
But among ordinary Russians
Solzhenitsyn seems subject to the
lot of many prophets before him:
lack of understanding and
appreciation, indifference or even
hostility, on the part of his own
people.
With the Dec. 28 publication in
Paris of Solzhenitsyn's latest book
the "Gulag Archipelago," a
scathing indictment of terror
during the reign of Joseph Stalin,
the battle lines are drawn again:
"Tell me what you think of

'Archipelago' and I will tell you
who you are."
Most Russians probably could
not give a knowledgeable answer
to what they think of the book. It
is banned here, along with
Solzhenitsyn's other works, and
the author is denounced from
party tribunes as a "hack writer,"
a "traitor" an "internal
emigrant," a "loathsome
creature."
Smear Campaign
Given their isolation and the
ferocious momentum of the
authorities' smear campaign, it is a
safe bet that the majority of
ordinary Russians would go along
with the official assessment of
Solzhenitsyn — or at least not
question it publicly.
It is extremely difficult for an
outsider to accurately gauge the
Russian psyche. There are no
public opinion polls in the
U.S.S.R., and foreigners are
isolated and restricted to such a
degree they can establish no real
dialogue with average Soviet
citizens.
But a way to get a glimpse of
what's on Russians' minds is to
attend one of thy numerous
public current events lectures
sponsored all over the country by
the Znaniye — Knowledge Society
— a propaganda arm of the
Communist party.
Moscow Lecture
At such a lecture in Moscow
last week, at least half the
questions asked by the audience
were about Solzhenitsyn and his

new book, indicating a
widespread, if uninformed,
curiosity about the affair. They
also indicated a pronounced
hostility toward the author.
"Who is this Solzhenitsyn?"
asked one spectator. "The son of

a Rostov landowner," replied the
party lecturer, "who ... was
sentenced for actions during
wartime that no army permits."
The implication was that
Solzhenitsyn had turned and run

away from battle, meriting the
label of traitor. Actually, he was
arrested on the front in February
1945 for making veiled,
unflattering references to Stalin in
letters to a friend.
