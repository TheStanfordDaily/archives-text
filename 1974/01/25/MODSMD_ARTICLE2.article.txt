# Faculty Senate Postpones ROTC
## 
### DIANE NORBURG 
The Faculty Senate voted yesterday
to postpone indefinitely the question
of initiation of new ROTC programs
here. The 29 to 12 vote in favor of
postponement ended immediately
consideration of the issue.
The vote is considered official
University response to the 52
Academic Council members who
petitioned in November that an ROTC
reinstatement be considered by the
Senate.
Rules of parliamentary procedure
state that an issue which is postponed
indefinitely may be resubmitted for
consideration at a later date. No
resubmission is immediately
anticipated.
The vote followed the presentation
of three alternative propositions by
the Senate steering committee. The
second and third propositions became
moot with the passage of the first
proposition in favor of indefinite
postponement.
Proposition 2 would have called for
a scheduling of the ROTC issue for

Senate debate to discuss the present
validity of the report from the
President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs. The report, endorsed
by the Senate in June, 1970,
represents the standing University
policy on ROTC.
Proposition 3 would have called for
the reactivation of the ROTC
committee for the purpose of
inquiring into current Department of
Defense regulations governing campus
ROTC programs.
Prior to the vote, Humanities
Professor William A. Clebsch urged the
Senate to let the "broad and open"
policy of the 1970 report stand.
"The University adopted at that
time an intelligible and defensible
position. I'd like to see us continue
with it," Clebsch said.
Finance Remarks
Before considering the ROTC issue,
the Senate heard a 45-minute report
from Provost William F. Miller
concerning finance of higher
education. Miller said his remarks were
preparatory to the budget presentation
scheduled for the March 7 Senate
meeting.
Miller focused on the thesis that
higher education is a declining
business, saying, "There are social
needs in competition with higher
education, therefore support goes
down assuming finite resources."
Although he believes that public
confidence in the University is
relatively high, Miller stated that the
institution is being affected by a shift
toward short-term support for
particular projects instead of general
gifts from foundations and private
individuals.
Despite a continued gain in current
dollars support to the University,
Miller said that in real dollars, support
has declined since 1968.
"The real-dollar decline represents a
substantial diminution of support,"
Miller said.
"We are impacted also by the
willingness to pay higher tuition," he
added. Miller suggested that the
University is studying the possibility
that future tuition raises be made in

proportion to average income
increases.
"I think this is a reasonably sound
policy," he said. "We could justify
increasing tuition at the rate that
personal per capita income increases."
Federal Funding Withdrawn
The withdrawal of federal funding,
especially for libraries and computing
centers, has created a cost that must
be absorbed by other sectors, Miller
noted. Federal support for facilities —
which reached $713 million in 1967 —
has been completely eliminated for
1974.
Miller based his comments on the
breakdown of fund sources for the
University's "academic enterprises." A
graph showed that 50 percent of the
funding comes from government
grants and contracts. Tuition accounts
for about 20 percent of the

University's income.
About 12 percent of the support
comes from endowments, and the
remainder from gifts, non-government
loans, and other sources.
'Bright Hope'
Miller called scholarships,
fellowships and loans "one area of
bright hope." The University is
receiving continued support from the
California State Scholarships, he said.
The effect of the $300 million
dollar 5-year Campaign for Stanford
will be to add $150 million beyond
the normal amount of support for a
5-year period, Miller stated. Although
the campaign is proceeding
successfully, Miller said that since
many of the contributions are
specially earmarked, the University is
left with fewer funds than they
expected for this year.
