# Primate Studies Correlate Chimp, Human Depressions
## 
### 
Human Biology Prof. David A. Hamburg
emphasized Wednesday night that research into
non-human primate behavior and physiology has
"deepened our understanding" of depressed and
psychotic states in human beings.
Speaking to 300 people in Memorial
Auditorium, he asserted that there is a high
correlation between depressive and psychotic
behavior in humans and chimpanzees.
"Interpersonal loss and loss of action or
interaction essential to maintaining an individual's
self respect are precipitating factors in depression
or psychosis," he said.
Researchers at the Gombe Stream Research
Center in Tanzania, directed by Human Biology
Prof. Jane Goodall, observed that when a
chimpanzee discovered his mother had died, he "sat
in a huddled posture, stopped playing and
exploring, ate almost nothing," and eventually lost
one-third of his original body weight, Hamburg
said.
In Cambridge, England, chimpanzees separated
from their peer "social group" for a period of six
months also developed serious physical and mental
disorders, characterized by clasping of the body,
lack of appetite, and lack of response to
stimulation, he added.

According to Hamburg, "One important
research frontier involves the point of junction
between behavior and biochemistry."
Laboratory and clinical evidence suggests that
"the ability to cope with the stresses of living may
be impaired in some persons by biochemical
processes," he said.
According to Hamburg, experimentation with
the effects of amphetamines on the physiology and
behavior of monkeys has yielded evidence that
schizophrenia may stem from the same biochemical
imbalances induced in the brain by amphetamines
and hallucinogens.
Hamburg added that amphetamine-injected
monkeys showed behavior similar to that of human
paranoid schizophrenics including withdrawal,
suspicion and extreme anxiety.
"Adolescence in both chimpanzees and humans
is a time of extensive change in behavior and
physiology," Hamburg said. He added that the
"upsurge" in the secretion of brain, pituitary, and
sexual hormones at puberty may directly influence
behavioral changes in chimpanzees and human
beings.
Observing adolescent chimpanzees, researchers
at Gombe noticed a marked increase of aggressive
behavior in the male, and of sexual behavior in the
female, according to Hamburg.
