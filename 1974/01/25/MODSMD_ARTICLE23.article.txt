# Thai Connection: Nixon Friends In Asian Deals
## 
### Commentary By JONATHAN MARSHALL 'Daily' Columnist 
When Secretary of State
William Rogers told a group of
corporate executives in 1971 that
"This is a business
administration," little did he
know how well the Watergate
revelations — from ITT to the
Dairy Deal — would prove him
correct.
Contrary to popular belief,
however, Richard Nixon's
favoritism towards big business
derives from personal connections
and philosophic convictions rather
than from old-fashioned bribery.
His long-time association with
the business community as a
corporate lawyer with Nixon,
Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and
Alexander led naturally to his
quashing of anti-trust action
against such firm clients as ITT, El
Paso Natural Gas, and
Warner-Lambert. When he allowed
Pepsico to win an exclusive
contract with the Soviet Union,
Nixon was only showing his
friendship toward a former client.
In return, these and other
corporations showed their
appreciation by raising over $60
million to finance his 1972
re-election campaign.
An in-depth examination of a
major conflict-of-interest deal
which fell through, involving
several leading corporations and
government agencies, illustrates
the dynamic interplay between
the Nixon administration and the
business world.
Far East
The story begins with Henry
Kearns, a sometime southern
California car salesman and
winner of the "Most Useful
Young Man in California" award
for 1944-45. Kearns caught the
special attention of the
Republican party through his
membership on the Hoover
Commission Task Force on
Intelligence Activities chaired by
General Mark Clark, a member of
the far-right American Security
Council (which Nixon associated
with in the McCarthy days).
Kearns directed the
Eisenhower-Nixon campaign in
southern California in 1956, for
which he was awarded the post of
Assistant Secretary of Commerce
for International Affairs. On his
official trips abroad, especially to
Manila, Singapore, and Bangkok,
Kearns established contacts with
the multinational business
community just then developing
an interest in expanding
investment opportunities in the
Far East.

Despite their friendship, Nixon
and Kearns parted ways after
Nixon's defeat in the 1960
Presidential election. While Nixon
set his hopes on winning the 1962
California gubernatorial election,
Kearns, a self-styled "developer of
domestic and international
ventures," cultivated his own
contacts in the Far East.
Coincidence
In 1962 Kearns became an
"Adviser" to the board of
directors of the Japanese
super-conglomerate Mitsui, which
in 1963 contracted with Indonesia
for a lucrative ten-year oil-drilling
program. Was it coincidence that
the law firm Nixon joined that
year represented Mitsui's interests
in the United States?
Whatever the answer, Nixon
certainly appreciated his
friendship with Kearns. On his
extended trips to the Far East in
1964 and 1966 to handle overseas
legal matters for Pepsico and
other multinational firms, Nixon
was always accompanied by
Kearns, who arranged the former
Vice-President's itinerary.
Kearns did not neglect his
commercial projects, however. A
former life insurance salesman, he
knew the value of certainty in
business ventures. In 1964 he
organized (through his American
Capital Corporation) the Siam
Kraft Paper Company in Thailand.
Concessions
Thanks to the Thai
government's dependence on US
aid funds and Kearn's contacts in
the U.S. government, Kearns won
special privileges for his company.
Thailand granted him a monopoly
concession and established a
prohibitive tariff on foreign
imports; the U.S. Export-Import
Bank financed the venture with a
$14 million loan.
Beginning in 1964, Keams
branched out into worldwide
industrial land development
schemes, drawing upon his
previous experience as a realtor.
In 1968 he entered into a
partnership along these lines
called Thai Industrial Estates.
Strangely enough, the firm never
purchased or developed any land.
His partners included the Stans
Foundation (which Maurice Stans
incorporated in 1945 as a tax
dodge for his investment
transactions) and the New York
investment banking house, Glore
Forgan-Staats.
Maurice Stans, whorti Nixon
had just appointed chief
fundraiser for his 1968
presidential campaign, had been
president of Glore Forgan since
1965. Other members of this

respectable eastern firm included
Richard Millar, a member of
Northrop Corporation's board of
directors, and important CIA
figures like James Russell Forgan
and William Jackson.
Kalmbach
Northrop, Glore Forgan, and
the Stans Foundation are all
represented by Herbert
Kalmbach's law firm, Kalmbach,
DeMarco, Knapp &
Chillingsworth. This firm still
handles Nixon's financial matters
— free of charge. Kalmbach
personally supervised the purchase
and renovation of the San
Clemente estate. While Nixon has
severed formal ties with Haldeman
and Ehrlichman, Nixon has not
ended his relationship with
Kalmbach, despite Kalmbach's
direct link to the Watergate affair
(he hired and paid Donald Segretti
$40,000 to disrupt the Muskie
campaign).
When Nixon took office in
January, 1969, he immediately
appointed Maurice Stans
Secretary of Commerce and
Henry Kearns president of the
Export-Import Bank. Stans and
Kearns dissolved Thai Industrial
Estates. Glore Forgan and the
Stans Foundation were paid off
with stock from Siam Kraft Paper
Co. Kearns himself still owned 8
percent of the stock, worth about
$750,000.
At the Kearns confirmation
hearings, Senator William
Proxmire (D.-Wis.) asked Kearns if
his holdings in a company
financed by the Export-Import
Bank wouldn't pose a conflict of
interest. Kearns assured the
skeptical Senator that he would
put his holdings (100,000 shares)
into a blind trust managed by
Bank of America (which didn't
end the conflict at all), and that
he would let his subordinate, Don
Bostwick, Executive
Vice-President of the Bank,
handle all dealings with the Siam
Kraft Paper Company.
Unfortunately, as a former
vice-president of Kearns
International, Bostwick was
hardly a disinterested party; he
still owned 8000 shares of Siam
Kraft stock!
Conflict
Stans was hardly in a better
position. Although he protested
that "there is nothing whatsoever
in this situation that could
conceivably involve conflict of
interest for me," his $25,000
holding in government-financed
Siam-Kraft during his terms as
Secretary of Commerce belied the
claim. Stans never was very good
at recognizing conflicts of

interest.
Only last year it was revealed
that Stans held a $318,000
interest in a Penn Central
subsidiary at the time the
Commerce Department was
involved in secret efforts to save
the railroad from bankruptcy.
Stan's firm, Glore Forgan, acted
as an investment adviser to Penn
Central.
What did all this conflict of
interest lead to? Ever since Kearns
had set up Siam Kraft Paper
Company with enormous favors
from the Thai and U.S.
governments, he stood by and
watched while Parson & Whitmore
Inc., a New York construction
company that he brought in,
drained away Siam Kraft's initial
capitalization of through vastly
inflated construction fees.
Enter The Bank
P&W now faces a $20 million
law suit for its fraudulent
activities. But Kearns didn't want
his original company to go under
so quickly. In 1970, Siam Kraft
was saved from imminent
bankruptcy by an unprecedented
20-year re-scheduling of loans by
the Export-Import Bank! Kearns,
Stans, and Bostwick profited
handsomely.
In 1970 alone, the Stans
Foundation reported an increase
in net untaxable worth of over
$300,000. Of course, all this
might have proved most
embarassing, but the major
Watergate scandals, in which Stans
was a leading figure,
overshadowed all of these deals.
All this might seem rather
petty, if it didn't involve a much
larger, multimillion dollar deal
between Northrop Corporation
and the Export-Import Bank. In
March, 1971, Northrop
announced its interest in building
a major new international airport
in Thailand, in a swamp about 25
km. from Bangkok. Although
Northrop has had no previous
experience in airport construction
(indeed, the very idea of a major
airport franchise is original), it has
had plenty of experience in
Southeast Asia with the US

government.
Northrop builds F-5 and F-5E
fighter bombers, "the mainstay of
the air forces of Southeast Asian
countries," according to the Los
Angeles Times. Called the
"Freedom Fighter," by Northrop
promotional literature, "Over 400
F-s's are now in service with 11
free-world nations around the
globe." F-5 squadrons are active
in such "free" countries as Spain,
Greece, Iran, Taiwan, Turkey, the
Philippines, and Vietnam, thanks
to US military aid programs.
The President and Chairman of
the Board of Northrop, Tom
Jones, sits on the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University.
His other affiliations include the
Industry Advisory Council of the
Department of Defense, the Board
of Advisers of the Industrial
College of the Armed Forces, and
the Board of Visitors of the Air
Force Systems Command.
So when Northrop announced
its interest in building a new
airport in Thailand, it was taken
seriously. Northrop created a
subsidiary called the Northrop
Airport Development Corporation
(NADC) with minority control of
a nominally Thai company,
Northrop Thai Airport Company,
Ltd. (NTAC), to advance the
proposal to the Thai government.
Lucrative.
Its unprecedented plan was to
have NTAC finance, design,
engineer, and operate for twenty
years a new international airport
on land provided by the Royal
Thai government, after which
control would pass to the
government. The airport would
cost at least $100 million to
construct, with an equal cost for
subsequent expansion. Financing
would come from Kearns'
Export-Import Bank. After taxes,
Northrop expected to net an
estimated $290 million.
When these proposals came to
light, public reaction in Thailand
was swift and highly negative.
First, no real need had been
established for another airport;
the International Air Transport
Association pointed out that

Bangkok's present airport could
handle expected traffic and that
Northrop was manufacturing
figures to prove otherwise
(regardless of the airport's
performance, NADC would reap
the construction profits).
Indeed, Northrop's proposed
price tag for maintaining the
airport was three times the
amount suggested by an
independent consulting firm. The
land chosen for the airport site
was a rapidly-sinking swamp.
Further, NADC would require the
Thai government to pay all
"infrastructure" costs, such as
roads between the congested
airport and Bangkok. Finally, and
most brazenly, the proposal
contained no provision for
competitive bidding.
Junta
Such objections might have
killed an ordinary project. The
chairman of Thailand's airport
negotiating committee, however,
was Air Chief Marshal Dawee
Chullasapya, then a member of
the ruling junta — and extremely
close to the American embassy.
His family happened to own land
right near the proposed airport
site; coincidentally, no doubt, the
Marshal suppressed opposition to
the airport plan. Other Thai
groups with an interest in the
project included the influential
Chaiyasutr family.
On the American side, support
for the project came from Henry
Kearns of the Export-Import
Bank, which would finance the
venture. Without his backing
Northrop could never have gotten
off the ground. As he told
newsmen in Thailand, the project
would be essential to Thailand's
long-term importance as an
international air center, and that
financing would be "no problem."
Northrop and Kearns signed a
contract on February 1.
Why was Kearns so favorable
to the proposal? Again, we can
look to business ties within the
Administration. Richard Millar, a
director of Northrop, is
Vice-Chairman of Glore Forgan,
to which Kearns is associated

through Stans. Glore Forgan,
Northrop, the Stans Foundation,
and the Nixon Foundation are all
leading clients of Kalmbach's law
firm.
Generosity
Jack Bailhe, the official for the
Agency for International
Development who first suggested
that the Export-Import Bank
reschedule its loan with Siam
Kraft Paper Company, now works
for Northrop. Finally, and most
persuasively, Tom Jones, head of
Northrop and a Stanford Trustee,
illegally donated $75,000 in cash
to Kalmbach to finance the
defense of the Watergate burglars.
Such generosity endeared him to
his friends and business associates
within the Administration.
Unfortunately for Tom Jones,
factors outside his control led to
the collapse of the project two
weeks ago. Severe dissatisfaction
with the proposal from nationalist
groups in Thailand (left and right)
forced a slowdown of Northrop's
plans; the U.S. embassy
apparently feared that the project
might adversely affect U.S.-Thai
relations at a time when America's
hold on Southeast Asia is
especially precarious.
But the mini-revolution
organized by Thai students last
month, which ousted the ruling
military clique which favored
Northrop, really killed the airport
plan. Pressure from students,
intellectuals, and nationalists has
finally forced the new Thai
government to call a halt to
Northrop's profitable dreams.
This story of worldwide
business deals between large
corporations and members of the
Nixon Administration is complex
but intriguing. It illustrates the
extent of the business-government
partnership that has developed
over the past five years at the
expense of the American public.
Devoted to business and dedicated
to furthering its diverse interests,
Watergates will always come easily
to Nixon and his associates.
