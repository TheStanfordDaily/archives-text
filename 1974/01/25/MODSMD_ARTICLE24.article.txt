# 'Cabaret' Flawed, But Entertaining
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Risking comparison with one
of the finest musical films of all
time, the Palo Alto Workshop
valiantly opened a' local-talent
production of Cabaret at the
former Palo Alto Police Station
on Bryant Street last Friday night.
Despite flaws in both production
and performance, the audience
had a thoroughly good time.
Christopher Isherwood's
delightful stories about pre-Nazi
Berlin first reached the stage in
the 1940s as "I Am a Camera," a
play about winsome Sally Bowles
and her low-life friends.
Transformed into Cabaret, a hit
Broadway musical, the show
eventually became the fabulously
successful film 'starring Liza
Minelli and Joel Grey in
Academy-Award-winning
performances.

That young, untrained actors
and actresses would pit their
talents against Hollywood for
local favor is commendable, but
nonetheless risky. The ASSU
Sunday Flicks featured Cabaret a
few weeks ago and easily filled the
house three times; the film toured
this area for six months last year.
To put it bluntly, the
Mid-Penninsula has been saturated
with Cabaret.
Cynicism Missing
A sufficiently vital production
could easily renew interest in this
exceptionally fine musical, and
director Alan Mokler did his best.
But one problem was inescapable:
the Workshop's young performers
simply can't convincingly project
the cynicism Cabaret demands for
full theatrical impact. Vivacious
girls and boys unwittingly
transformed explicitly obscene

songs and dances into ingenuous
travesties of decadence. Cabaret
makes a point about morality and
the rise of the Nazi Party, but that
point is blurred amid such juvenile
imitation of evil.
No one could have had a
tougher job on stage Friday night
than Nancy Weston, who played
Sally Bowles with both occasional
artistic insights and a certain
amount of misdirected
enthusiasm. She improved
throughout the evening, and her
well-paced performance of the
concluding title song was moving.
Additional performances may
bring her that more casually-paced
delivery she needs to match her

sense of stage presence ard
potential for musical
development.
MC Imitates Grey
Youthful Raymond Azevedo as
the Kit-Kat Club's Master of
Ceremonies aped Joel Grey
capably, but contributed few
original touches to his technically
accomplished song-and-dance
numbers. But Bridget Ross and
David Springhorn delivered
strong, convincing performances
of aging Fr. Schneider and Herr
Schultz — parts all but obliterated
in the movie. Their two touching
duets were among the evening's
better musical efforts.
Kelly DePonte as Cliff

Bradshaw got off to a wooden
start, but improved in the second
act, when he managed to project a
naive intransigence and
hopefulness appropriate to the
show's intentions. David Miller as
Ernst Ludwig, on the other hand,
was wooden throughout. And
Linda Heidinger's broad portrayal
of prostitute Fr. Kost was, well,
broad.
With a better band, some
better performers, and a show
they can handle aesthetically as
well as technically, the Workshop
could unquestionably deliver an
evening of even more appealing
entertainment. Let's hope their
next show isn't O, Calcutta!.

Risking comparison with one
of the finest musical films of all
time, the Palo Alto Workshop
valiantly opened a' local-talent
production of Cabaret at the
former Palo Alto Police Station
on Bryant Street last Friday night.
Despite flaws in both production
and performance, the audience
had a thoroughly good time.
Christopher Isherwood's
delightful stories about pre-Nazi
Berlin first reached the stage in
the 1940s as "I Am a Camera," a
play about winsome Sally Bowles
and her low-life friends.
Transformed into Cabaret, a hit
Broadway musical, the show
eventually became the fabulously
successful film 'starring Liza
Minelli and Joel Grey in
Academy-Award-winning
performances.

That young, untrained actors
and actresses would pit their
talents against Hollywood for
local favor is commendable, but
nonetheless risky. The ASSU
Sunday Flicks featured Cabaret a
few weeks ago and easily filled the
house three times; the film toured
this area for six months last year.
To put it bluntly, the
Mid-Penninsula has been saturated
with Cabaret.
Cynicism Missing
A sufficiently vital production
could easily renew interest in this
exceptionally fine musical, and
director Alan Mokler did his best.
But one problem was inescapable:
the Workshop's young performers
simply can't convincingly project
the cynicism Cabaret demands for
full theatrical impact. Vivacious
girls and boys unwittingly
transformed explicitly obscene

songs and dances into ingenuous
travesties of decadence. Cabaret
makes a point about morality and
the rise of the Nazi Party, but that
point is blurred amid such juvenile
imitation of evil.
No one could have had a
tougher job on stage Friday night
than Nancy Weston, who played
Sally Bowles with both occasional
artistic insights and a certain
amount of misdirected
enthusiasm. She improved
throughout the evening, and her
well-paced performance of the
concluding title song was moving.
Additional performances may
bring her that more casually-paced
delivery she needs to match her

sense of stage presence ard
potential for musical
development.
MC Imitates Grey
Youthful Raymond Azevedo as
the Kit-Kat Club's Master of
Ceremonies aped Joel Grey
capably, but contributed few
original touches to his technically
accomplished song-and-dance
numbers. But Bridget Ross and
David Springhorn delivered
strong, convincing performances
of aging Fr. Schneider and Herr
Schultz — parts all but obliterated
in the movie. Their two touching
duets were among the evening's
better musical efforts.
Kelly DePonte as Cliff

Bradshaw got off to a wooden
start, but improved in the second
act, when he managed to project a
naive intransigence and
hopefulness appropriate to the
show's intentions. David Miller as
Ernst Ludwig, on the other hand,
was wooden throughout. And
Linda Heidinger's broad portrayal
of prostitute Fr. Kost was, well,
broad.
With a better band, some
better performers, and a show
they can handle aesthetically as
well as technically, the Workshop
could unquestionably deliver an
evening of even more appealing
entertainment. Let's hope their
next show isn't O, Calcutta!.
