# Dan Hicks Goes It Alone
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - Anyone
who has sat through a loud
acid-rock band only to have their
ears buzzing through the act they
came to hear could truly
appreciate the Boarding House's
double feature of last week,
Lonesome Dan Hicks and The San
Francisco Strutters.
Most musicians would like to
believe that they are so original as
to defy classification. Dan Hicks is
one of the rare instances in which
this is undeniably true.
His repertoire ranges from
country to rock to swing, with
most of the tunes lying
somewhere in between. No one has
thought of a name for it yet.
Hicks for years led one of the
finest, and easily the most
original, bands in the Bay Area,
Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks.
Prior to that, he was a member of
the Charlatans in the mid-60s.
Thursday night Lonesome Dan
and his new band began with one
of the Hot Licks' country tunes,
"How Can I Miss You When You
Won't Go Away?"
Deadpan Humor
After the long pause which
followed Hicks mumbled, "Oh,
did that song end?" in his
characteristic, deadpan style. The
offbeat sense of humor Hicks
brings to a performance has come
to be almost as much a part of the
show as the music.
Next was a nice yodelling
Jimmie Rodgers tune, "Peach
Pickin' Time In Georgia."

Hicks sang several Hot Licks
standards, such as "The Buzzard
Was Their Friend," " 'Long Come
A Viper" and "Evenin' Breeze,"
with Dan handling both the lead
vocal and the Lickettes harmonies
("What you singin' 'bout Dan?"),
now that his group is minus its
two female singers.
New, Untitled Tunes
The set also included a few
new compositions which Dan has
not titled yet. One used to be
titled "The Loner With The
Boner," another was almost going
to be "My Shit Don't Stink," and
the third Dan decided not to call
"Show Me Yer Tits."
Lonesome Dan's quartet still
features the same rhythm section
as before — Jaime "Skippy
Sanchez" Leopold on bass, Bob
Scott on drums, and Hicks on
rhythm guitar. The fourth and
only new member of the group
was Louis Aissen, a fairly
unoriginal guitarist.
Despite the cynical humor
which most people associate with
Dan Hicks ("When does this stuff
start takin' effect?"), he is an
extremely fine singer. His best
number was the beautiful ballad
"Sweet Lorraine," made famous
by Nat King Cole.
Strutters Bring Back Tap
Preceding Hicks were the San
Francisco Strutters who quite
literally have to be seen to be
appreciated. The reason: tap
dancing.
Unfortunately, tap dancing has
come to be one of the "lost arts"
in recent years. But, the Boarding
House audience showed that it is
high time to bring it back.
With guitarist Michael Miller,
trumpeter Lee Kefauver, and
tap-dancing Jacqueline Portnoy,
the three Strutters have just
recently graduated from the
streets — at the Cannery and in
front of A.C.T. — into clubs, and
the response has been very
favorable.
The Strutters belong to the
"nostalgia school" along with
Hicks, Maria Muldaur, the Pointer
Sisters and Bette Midler, but go a
step further. Their sound is much
more authentic, with its
chunk-chunk rhythm guitar and
solo trumpet.
Their repertoire consists

entirely of old jazz and pop
standards, such as "Makin'
Whoopee," "Bill Bailey" and
"Million Dollar Baby."
Portnoy sang most of the
selections with a powerful voice,
demonstrating her experience in
the theater. Miller's raspy,
Satchmo-type voice provided the
lead on "Mack The Knife," and
Billie Holiday's "God Bless The
Child" was sung beautifully by
Kefauver.
The three have been together
for about a year and a half, and
appeared in Walter Matthau's film
"The Laughing Policeman." They
will also be in the
soon-to-be-released film "The
Conversation," which stars Gene
Hackman.

Despite the cynical humor
which most people associate with
Dan Hicks ("When does this stuff
start takin' effect?"), he is an
extremely fine singer. His best
number was the beautiful ballad
"Sweet Lorraine," made famous
by Nat King Cole.
Strutters Bring Back Tap
Preceding Hicks were the San
Francisco Strutters who quite
literally have to be seen to be
appreciated. The reason: tap
dancing.
Unfortunately, tap dancing has
come to be one of the "lost arts"
in recent years. But, the Boarding
House audience showed that it is
high time to bring it back.
With guitarist Michael Miller,
trumpeter Lee Kefauver, and
tap-dancing Jacqueline Portnoy,
the three Strutters have just
recently graduated from the
streets — at the Cannery and in
front of A.C.T. — into clubs, and
the response has been very
favorable.
The Strutters belong to the
"nostalgia school" along with
Hicks, Maria Muldaur, the Pointer
Sisters and Bette Midler, but go a
step further. Their sound is much
more authentic, with its
chunk-chunk rhythm guitar and
solo trumpet.
Their repertoire consists

entirely of old jazz and pop
standards, such as "Makin'
Whoopee," "Bill Bailey" and
"Million Dollar Baby."
Portnoy sang most of the
selections with a powerful voice,
demonstrating her experience in
the theater. Miller's raspy,
Satchmo-type voice provided the
lead on "Mack The Knife," and
Billie Holiday's "God Bless The
Child" was sung beautifully by
Kefauver.
The three have been together
for about a year and a half, and
appeared in Walter Matthau's film
"The Laughing Policeman." They
will also be in the
soon-to-be-released film "The
Conversation," which stars Gene
Hackman.
SAN FRANCISCO - Anyone
who has sat through a loud
acid-rock band only to have their
ears buzzing through the act they
came to hear could truly
appreciate the Boarding House's
double feature of last week,
Lonesome Dan Hicks and The San
Francisco Strutters.
Most musicians would like to
believe that they are so original as
to defy classification. Dan Hicks is
one of the rare instances in which
this is undeniably true.
His repertoire ranges from
country to rock to swing, with
most of the tunes lying
somewhere in between. No one has
thought of a name for it yet.
Hicks for years led one of the
finest, and easily the most
original, bands in the Bay Area,
Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks.
Prior to that, he was a member of
the Charlatans in the mid-60s.
Thursday night Lonesome Dan
and his new band began with one
of the Hot Licks' country tunes,
"How Can I Miss You When You
Won't Go Away?"
Deadpan Humor
After the long pause which
followed Hicks mumbled, "Oh,
did that song end?" in his
characteristic, deadpan style. The
offbeat sense of humor Hicks
brings to a performance has come
to be almost as much a part of the
show as the music.
Next was a nice yodelling
Jimmie Rodgers tune, "Peach
Pickin' Time In Georgia."

Hicks sang several Hot Licks
standards, such as "The Buzzard
Was Their Friend," " 'Long Come
A Viper" and "Evenin' Breeze,"
with Dan handling both the lead
vocal and the Lickettes harmonies
("What you singin' 'bout Dan?"),
now that his group is minus its
two female singers.
New, Untitled Tunes
The set also included a few
new compositions which Dan has
not titled yet. One used to be
titled "The Loner With The
Boner," another was almost going
to be "My Shit Don't Stink," and
the third Dan decided not to call
"Show Me Yer Tits."
Lonesome Dan's quartet still
features the same rhythm section
as before — Jaime "Skippy
Sanchez" Leopold on bass, Bob
Scott on drums, and Hicks on
rhythm guitar. The fourth and
only new member of the group
was Louis Aissen, a fairly
unoriginal guitarist.
Despite the cynical humor
which most people associate with
Dan Hicks ("When does this stuff
start takin' effect?"), he is an
extremely fine singer. His best
number was the beautiful ballad
"Sweet Lorraine," made famous
by Nat King Cole.
