# Bach Series Begins Tonight
## 
### 
An unprecedented Bay Area
performance, J.S. Bach's The
Well-Tempered. Clavier
complete in a weekend series
of three recitals, will be offered
by harpsichordist Margaret
Fabrizio of Stanford's music
faculty tonight, tomorrow and
Sunday at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The three-day concert will
mark the most compact
presentation of this extensive
baroque masterpiece ever held
in the Bay Area, and one of the
rare occasions when the whole
work is performed anywhere,
except on recordings.
The 48 preludes and fugues
will not be performed in
sequence according to key, but
in an order more suitable for
the concert listener.
Although well known for
her extensive contemporary
repertoire, Fabrizio also strives,
when performing the works of
past masters, for fidelity to
their intentions. It is this
tendency which led her, in
1967, to become the first
person in the United States to
perform Bach's The Art of
Fugue on harpsichord, and led
one local critic to remark:
. . it became clear to me that
harpisichord is just the right
instrument for it when
Margaret Fabrizio played —
with fine musical success — the
entire Bach Art of Fugue."
Fabrizio will display the
results of her more recent work
with Baroque music in the
three-part performance of The
Well-Tempered Clavier."

The performance will be
rendered according to the
specific system of analysis set
forth in writing, not by Bach
himself, who left no theoretical
writings, but by his pupil,
Johann Philipp Kirnberger.
Kirnberger was seeking, in
his own words, "to reduce the
method of the late Johann
Sebastian Bach to principles,
and to lay his teachings before
the world" — a task to which
he was driven because of his
belief that .. one can no
longer endure fugues because
through miserable performance
which defines neither phrase
nor accents, they have become
a mere chaos of sounds."
