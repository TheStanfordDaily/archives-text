# Ballet Season Opener Features Classics, Disappointing Premiere
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
SAN FRANCISCO -
Importing two of the Stuttgart
Ballet's tcp stars and ballets for
the occasion, the San Francisco
Ballet opened an exciting
winter/spring season Saturday
night at the Opera House.
Starting off the evening was
Kokine's classic Les Sylphides,
staged by his pupil and ballerina
Alexandra Danilova. Les

Sylphides is the kind of romatic
ballet Joanne Woodward might be
tempted to make her stage debut
in. Lovely and fragile, this is the
work considered to have changed
the course of ballet away from
19th century three-act narratives
to 20th century modern.
The ballet is storyless but not
themeless, within is a poet, a band
of sylphs and a moonlit forest. A
plotless series of dances leads the
way to abstraction.

Mother Blues was Saturday's
disappointing premiere. Revving
up Warhol's stance that "youth is
being able to sit down in a coffee
shop and fall in love over a cup of
coffee," in Michael Smuin's young
dance (including the lindy, the
slop and the mashed potato), they
do not sit.
Stepbrother to Twyla Tharp's
Deuce Coupe for the Joffrey
Ballet, Smuin's premiere borrows
from the "now" family. The boy
on a skateboard draws on Carlos
Carvajal's The Way. Smuin's girls
in bikinis and boys in denim no
loner seem fresh. Using the
original Ozawa recording of
William Russo's Three Pieces for
Blues Band and Orchestra, music
is piped in through eight speakers.
Smuin described the ballet as "all
movement, no story line." The
corps-de-ballet, however, is fine in
this as in the other ballets.
Showing promise and
improvement over past seasons,
the San Francisco Ballet closed
with Balanchine's Symphony in C
(Bizet). This abstract ballet in
four movements was originally
staged in 1947. The ballet has no
theme, characteristic of
Balanchine.
