# Fine Indian Film Tonight
## 
### 
Satyajit Ray's The Adversary, a brilliant film by one of the world's
finest directors, will be screened tonight in Bishop Auditorium.
It is the second part of a political trilogy from the man who gave us
the Apu trilogy, certainly among the world's best movies of the 50s.
Each race contributes something essential to the world's civilization in
the course of its own self-expression. After watching Pather Panchali
at Cannes, Lanocito said: "On very few occasions we had seen .. .
such felicity of expression.... We had witnessed a kind of
self-revelation of Indian film art."
Originally a commercial artist, Ray was strongly influenced by
Renoir and de Sica, and led an Indian avant-garde through Bengali
cinema — the best in the country. The Western filmgoer is encouraged
to overcome any natural diffidence and sense of disadvantage in
appreciating, intellectually and emotionally, the product of a very
different culture. Many Indians from other states thoroughly
misunderstand Ray. But, his content is universal, and the tempo is
right for communicating an emotional experience.
