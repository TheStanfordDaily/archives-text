## Draft Prospects 
### Vlae Kershner 
This year's senior football players can thank their lucky stars, and
also their parents, that they were born in or around 1952 because this
is the year of the World Football League.
The WFL has set up 12 franchises. Multiply that times 40 and
you'll see that the new league must somehow find 480 football
players.
All of which bodes well for those Stanford seniors trying to carve a
niche in pro football. With 38 NFL and WFL fans bidding for
available talent, players a little smaller or a little slower than the norm
still have a shot.
For at least one Stanford senior, that fact means more than just a
chance to play. Mike Boryla, rated highly by pro scouts, was drafted
in the first round by the New York WFL franchise Tuesday, and has
an excellent chance to be an NFL first round pick this coming
Tuesday.
Bidding War?
A bidding war for Boryla? Probably not. Neither of the leagues has
shown an inclination toward offering huge bonuses a la 1966. But
still, Boryla ought to be able to do all right financially, especially
becaue his father Vince is acting as his agent. The elder Boryla, general
manager of the Utah Stars basketball team, presumably spends much
of his time trying to keep salaries down, and is relishing a chance to
argue the other side.
According to Christiansen, there are three other seniors on this
year's football team who will likely be drafted by NFL clubs - - kicker
Rod Garcia, cornerback James Ferguson and safety Randy Poltl.
Garcia has another offer — he was drafted in the fourth round by
the San Jose Earthquakes soccer team, although he hasn't played
competitive soccer since junior college. But soccer salaries are low,
and the game takes quite a bit more physical conditioning than being
a pro football kicker. So it would be earthshaking news if Garcia
didn't give pro football a chance.
Ferguson, according to Christiansen, though not spectacular, "is a
great natural athlete," and his quickness and smoothness made him a
good bet to be drafted.
Poltl, on the other hand, has never been known for his speed. But
he led the Stanford defense as captain this year, and, according to
Chris, "does it all in the game ... blocks the passes, makes the
openfield tackles," and will probably be given a shot in the NFL.
Other Names
There are other players whose names don't come as easily to mind
but who still may be drafted Tuesday.
For one, John Winesberry. What would a team want with a running
back who has chronic knee problems? Nothing, probably. But Wines
starred in another position, wide receiver, as a sophomore, and would
be less vulnerable to knee injury at that position.
Dave Ottmar also has an outside chance to carve out the same role
with a pro club as did a former Stanford reserve quarterback/punter,
Dave Lewis.
Nobody on Stanford's staff ever looked at center Bill Reid as much
of a pro prospect, and as late as four months ago, Reid was planning
to become a teacher and/or minister after graduation. Now he may
have to practice that career only in the off-season.
Reid played well in the Blue-Gray and Hula Bowl games, according
to Christiansen, and has been getting letters of invitation from at least
one NFL club.
Another player no one figured to have a chance is Jim Kaffen,
because of his 5'10" size. But the aggressive Kaffen may give it a try
in the new league, along with another small, aggressive player, receiver
Eric Cross, a 1973 graduate who never quite made it with the Dallas
Cowboys.

Bidding War?
A bidding war for Boryla? Probably not. Neither of the leagues has
shown an inclination toward offering huge bonuses a la 1966. But
still, Boryla ought to be able to do all right financially, especially
becaue his father Vince is acting as his agent. The elder Boryla, general
manager of the Utah Stars basketball team, presumably spends much
of his time trying to keep salaries down, and is relishing a chance to
argue the other side.
According to Christiansen, there are three other seniors on this
year's football team who will likely be drafted by NFL clubs - - kicker
Rod Garcia, cornerback James Ferguson and safety Randy Poltl.
Garcia has another offer — he was drafted in the fourth round by
the San Jose Earthquakes soccer team, although he hasn't played
competitive soccer since junior college. But soccer salaries are low,
and the game takes quite a bit more physical conditioning than being
a pro football kicker. So it would be earthshaking news if Garcia
didn't give pro football a chance.
Ferguson, according to Christiansen, though not spectacular, "is a
great natural athlete," and his quickness and smoothness made him a
good bet to be drafted.
Poltl, on the other hand, has never been known for his speed. But
he led the Stanford defense as captain this year, and, according to
Chris, "does it all in the game ... blocks the passes, makes the
openfield tackles," and will probably be given a shot in the NFL.
Other Names
There are other players whose names don't come as easily to mind
but who still may be drafted Tuesday.
For one, John Winesberry. What would a team want with a running
back who has chronic knee problems? Nothing, probably. But Wines
starred in another position, wide receiver, as a sophomore, and would
be less vulnerable to knee injury at that position.
Dave Ottmar also has an outside chance to carve out the same role
with a pro club as did a former Stanford reserve quarterback/punter,
Dave Lewis.
Nobody on Stanford's staff ever looked at center Bill Reid as much
of a pro prospect, and as late as four months ago, Reid was planning
to become a teacher and/or minister after graduation. Now he may
have to practice that career only in the off-season.
Reid played well in the Blue-Gray and Hula Bowl games, according
to Christiansen, and has been getting letters of invitation from at least
one NFL club.
Another player no one figured to have a chance is Jim Kaffen,
because of his 5'10" size. But the aggressive Kaffen may give it a try
in the new league, along with another small, aggressive player, receiver
Eric Cross, a 1973 graduate who never quite made it with the Dallas
Cowboys.
This year's senior football players can thank their lucky stars, and
also their parents, that they were born in or around 1952 because this
is the year of the World Football League.
The WFL has set up 12 franchises. Multiply that times 40 and
you'll see that the new league must somehow find 480 football
players.
All of which bodes well for those Stanford seniors trying to carve a
niche in pro football. With 38 NFL and WFL fans bidding for
available talent, players a little smaller or a little slower than the norm
still have a shot.
For at least one Stanford senior, that fact means more than just a
chance to play. Mike Boryla, rated highly by pro scouts, was drafted
in the first round by the New York WFL franchise Tuesday, and has
an excellent chance to be an NFL first round pick this coming
Tuesday.
