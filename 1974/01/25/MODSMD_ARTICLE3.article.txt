# Mancall Announces New Europe Projects

### DON COX 
Mark Mancall, director of the
overseas studies office, announced
yesterday at a press conference that
the University would open new
overseas programs in Vienna, Austria
and Berlin, Germany in the next two
years.
The new Vienna program will
combine courses at the University of
Vienna with a coordinated effort by
Stanford and University of Vienna
faculty members to cater to the
specific needs and interests of the
students. It is scheduled to open this
September and will accommodate
about 30 students.
Stanford had maintained a
centralized overseas campus in Vienna
up until one year ago when it was
closed after prohibitive economic
difficulties were encountered.
Intensive Course Work
The Berlin program will be
somewhat more advanced. Students

would have intense course work under
the direction of Stanford faculty and
will be able to audit courses at no
charge at the Free University and three
other universities in Berlin. It is
planned to open in January, 1975.
There would be no central Stanford
campus or living quarters at either site.
Students would live in various
university residences or apartments
not far from the universities. Students
could stay for one, two, or three
quarters.
This arrangement represents a
departure from the traditional
residential concept that has dominated
overseas programs.
Following negotiations with the
government, Hedi Thamig, designated
Associate Director of the Vienna
program, said she "had received a firm
committal to 30 beds in various
student residences not far from the
university."
Flexible
The curnculum will include
intensive language training, and a core
of history or cultural courses. The
curriculum, Thamig stressed, would
be very flexible to meet students
special interests.
Prior linguistic training would be
recommended, but not required. "We
want to encourage students of all
[linguistic] levels to attend. We would
not bar anybody," said Thamig.
The goal is to "integrate the
student into the life of the
University," said Mancall. Students are
capable of developing the ability to
attend lectures in a foreign university,
he said. "We're getting away from the
spoon feeding ways."
Craig is developing a smaller and
more advanced program in Berlin.
About 20 students at one time would
follow a core of historical, language,
and cultural courses and supplement
these with courses in international
relations or other specialized interests.
Craig travelled to Berlin over
Christmas to work on setting up the
program. He did not think that living
space would be too much of a problem
and that the program would be much
