# Wrestlers Set For Tourney
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
With a 5-5 record, the wrestling
team will compete in its third
tournament of the year this
weekend at Cal State-San
Francisco. Most western teams
will participate in the tourney,
including many squads on the
Cards' dual match schedule.
Coach Joe DeMeo expects a
"good performance" from the
young team. He named Mark
Yancey (134), Charlie Masch
(150), Jeff Richardson (167),
Marc Frelier (177) and Roy Tolles
(190) as having the best chance to
place against stiff competition.
The first three are freshmen,
and DeMeo believes they have
benefitted from the experience in
the first half of the season.
In fact, it was those three who
were the keys in Stanford's
unexpectedly tight win over Cal
State-Hayward on Wednesday. "It
was not a work of art," DeMeo
commented after the 27-24
victory. "There were all kinds of
problems."
Although DeMeo was only
talking about the Cards,
Hayward's coach would probably
have said the same thing. Stanford

only forfeited once, at 118
pounds. Hay ward forfeited thrice,
including the heavyweight match,
reversing a three-point margin.
Jim Tatarakis (126), who has
been off-again, on-again all season,
was off again. He started with an
early lead, but "fell apart" in
DeMeo's words, getting pinned in
the third round.
Yancey easily won, 11-4,
closing the team margin to 12-9.
Jim Rappaport (142), wrestling in
his first varsity match for the
Cards, looked good until the third
period, DeMeo said, but was
beaten in a last round fall.
Masch worked for an 8-0
decision, but Gary Thorn (158)
lost. Richardson also won 8-0, and
Frelier won by forfeit because his
opponent didn't feel well. That
knotted the score at 21.
The key match of the meet,
and certainly the most exciting
was the dual between Tolles and
Rich Swift. Swift ended up with a
6-5 win, but DeMeo said Tolles
"did a hell of a job."
The 190-pound match turned
out to be the last of the afternoon
as Kris Westersund received a
forfeit over an opponent he had

previously beaten in tournament
competition.
DeMeo was proud of achieving
the fifth victory, as only three
previous Stanford teams have
recorded that many. The Cards
are now shooting for eight wins,
the most in Stanford history.

The 190-pound match turned
out to be the last of the afternoon
as Kris Westersund received a
forfeit over an opponent he had

previously beaten in tournament
competition.
DeMeo was proud of achieving
the fifth victory, as only three
previous Stanford teams have
recorded that many. The Cards
are now shooting for eight wins,
the most in Stanford history.
With a 5-5 record, the wrestling
team will compete in its third
tournament of the year this
weekend at Cal State-San
Francisco. Most western teams
will participate in the tourney,
including many squads on the
Cards' dual match schedule.
Coach Joe DeMeo expects a
"good performance" from the
young team. He named Mark
Yancey (134), Charlie Masch
(150), Jeff Richardson (167),
Marc Frelier (177) and Roy Tolles
(190) as having the best chance to
place against stiff competition.
The first three are freshmen,
and DeMeo believes they have
benefitted from the experience in
the first half of the season.
In fact, it was those three who
were the keys in Stanford's
unexpectedly tight win over Cal
State-Hayward on Wednesday. "It
was not a work of art," DeMeo
commented after the 27-24
victory. "There were all kinds of
problems."
Although DeMeo was only
talking about the Cards,
Hayward's coach would probably
have said the same thing. Stanford

only forfeited once, at 118
pounds. Hay ward forfeited thrice,
including the heavyweight match,
reversing a three-point margin.
Jim Tatarakis (126), who has
been off-again, on-again all season,
was off again. He started with an
early lead, but "fell apart" in
DeMeo's words, getting pinned in
the third round.
Yancey easily won, 11-4,
closing the team margin to 12-9.
Jim Rappaport (142), wrestling in
his first varsity match for the
Cards, looked good until the third
period, DeMeo said, but was
beaten in a last round fall.
Masch worked for an 8-0
decision, but Gary Thorn (158)
lost. Richardson also won 8-0, and
Frelier won by forfeit because his
opponent didn't feel well. That
knotted the score at 21.
The key match of the meet,
and certainly the most exciting
was the dual between Tolles and
Rich Swift. Swift ended up with a
6-5 win, but DeMeo said Tolles
"did a hell of a job."
