# Ruggers Face Unbeaten SJS
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Last weekend after Stanford's
12-10 victory over the San
Francisco Rugby Club, Forrie
Martin, who is not known for his
mild-mannered appearance said,
"These games we're playing are
just practice games. What we're
really shooting for is the
Monterey Tournament."
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the
ruggers meet the undefeated San
Jose State Spartans. Forrie's
statement notwithstanding, it
should be tougher than practice.
The Spartans have a 3-0 record
after defeating Chico State and

the Sea Hawks.
The Cards defeated San Jose
in the Stanford 10-a-side
tournament last month, but those
games don't count in the team
record. "San Jose outplayed us in
that game and we were lucky to
win," said Stanford's Steve Piatt.
Coach Pete Kmetovic isn't
taking the Spartans lightly.
"They're are a young team with a
good captain. Buchanon,"
Kmetovic said. "He played at Cal
for a couple of years and he has
played all his life so he's a very
experienced player." The Cards
had trouble with an experienced
team last week, as San Francisco
shut off the Cards' scoring attack.
Stanford played an aggressive,
hard-hitting game last week, and
Kmetovic expects tomorrow's
action to be similar. "When two
young teams get together the
action is going to be heavy, with
plenty of hitting," he said.
Kmetovic has been trying to
find the best players to fill the
lineup and he will do this
tomorrow. He will be juggling the

second line tomorrow, starting
Gordy Riegel and Dave Morrison.
Last week the Cards had to
fight back after getting behind
early. However Kmetovic will
leave this "Cardiac Kid" style of
play to the USC Trojans. "We
want to get in front early in the
game and score as many points as
possible. It's not always possible
to come back when you get
behind, although we've been very
fortunate this year."
The Cards will be trying to get
the ball to Larry Lieberman
tomorrow. Last week Lieberman
was shut out by the SFRC
defense. "We weren't able to get
the ball to Lieberman as much as
we would have liked to against
San Francisco," Kmetovic said.
