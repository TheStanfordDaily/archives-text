# Tough Triangular Meet Awaits Card Gymnasts
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Tonight marks the opening of
the 1974 gymnastics season for
the Cardinals as they face Oregon,
Cal State-Northridge and Pac-8
Champion California at Berkeley
beginning at 7:30 p.m.
The meet will feature
compulsory routines and will be
followed by the optionals
tomorrow evening at Stanford.
The Saturday meet begins at 8
p.m., but will be limited to the
three Pac-8 schools.
Sadao Hamada enters the meet
following a 6-3 dual meet record
and a third place finish in the
conference last season in his first
year as head coach. Two of those
losses were to Cal and Oregon, but
Hamada isn't out to avenge them
just yet.
"For this weekend we're
putting more emphasis on getting
the routines together than on
individual score," he said. "We've
been working mostly on parts up
till now, and this will give us a
chance to see how it goes
together."
Build Toward NCAA's
Hamada's de-emphasis of the
competitive aspect of this meet is
a reflection of his coaching style
in general. He believes in building
toward the end of the season, and
is not particularly worried by the
prospect of an early loss. "If they
hit their routines well this week,

that's great," he said, "but if they
don't at least we'll find out what
we need to work on."
Hamada's statements
notwithstanding, spectators at this
weekend's competition will be
treated to a fine display of
gymnastics both by Stanford and
its opponents, particularly Cal.
Despite a lack of depth, a
situation which Hamada hopes
will remedy itself as the season
progresses, the Cards have some
excellent performers including
several who have fared well
nationally in past years. The list is
headed by two-time Olympian
Steve Hug, who spent last quarter
training and doing independent
study in Japan. Hug, who already
has two NCAA all-around titles to
his credit, will be going for an
unprecedented third this season.
Top Performers
Behind Hug in the all-around
are two other top performers, Bob
Anderson and Ted Miyamoto.
Anderson was the consensus top
all-around high school performer
in 1971, and Miyamoto is
returning for his final season after
sitting out the last half of last year
with a shoulder injury.
Two top freshmen, in the
all-around, performers Hamada
had coached in high school while
finishing his M.A. at Kent State,
ended up going to Cal instead and
will be facing their former mentor
this weekend. "It's too bad I
couldn't get either of them," he
said. "We needed the extra
depth."
Besides the all-around men,
Stanford has several fine athletes
in the individual events. In his
first year with the Cards,
sophomore Ted Marcy took first
in the Pac-8 side-horse and fourth
in the NCAA's. He has already
beaten the defending national
champion Ed Slezak of Indiana
State in a pre-season invitational
meet, and is a top contender for
this year's title.
Rings Strong
The rings are Stanford's
strongest single event. Howard
Bessen has consistently scored
high and placed in the NCAA in
1972. Behind him George Negrete
should add depth to the event.
Shawn Skerratt was runnerup in
the Pac-8 meet last season and will
also help out in the floor exercise

and parallel bars.
Sophomore Bill Madsen will
specialize in floor exercise again
this year. The high bar scores will
be bolstered by the return of Bob
Horwitz, who sat out last season
overseas.
Defending conference
champion Cal has a strong squad
again this year and will be
working toward a shot at the
national title. Standouts include
all-around performers Tom
Weeden and Clark Johnson, and
with the addition of Hamada's
proteges Dave Eby and Mike
Dubos, the Bears should be very
tough to beat.
Oregon was one of only three
teams to defeat the Cards in dual
competition last season, but
ended up last in the conference
due to late-season injuries. "We
expect them to be a lot stronger
now," said Hamada. Along with
Pac-8 runnerup Washington and
Cal, Oregon will be out to give
Stanford a hard time in this year's
converence meet.

BIDDING WAR?—Mike Boryla, who was a first round pick in last
Tuesday's World Football League draft and should be a first round
selection when the NFL holds its draft this Tuesday, won't have
trouble in the financial negotiations. Acting as his "agent" is his father
Vince, who as president of the Utah Star basketball team is a veteran
contract negotiator.
