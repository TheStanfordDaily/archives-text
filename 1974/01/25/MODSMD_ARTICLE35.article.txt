## Gavilan Improves 
### PETE BHATIA 
Gavilan '72 made a nice
comeback this week after
absorbing a 136-16 thrashing at
the hands of Rinc 69 last week.
This time they only lost 64-12
Wednesday night against Trancos.
Sandy Feldman poured through
seven points in the maximum
effort for Gavilan.
Mark Green tossed in 20 to
lead Trancos and teammate Dale
Zeitlin added 16.
An hour later Rinc 69 scored
only half as many points as last
week and gave up twice as many
— which means they won 66-31
over the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band. Don Hunt had 25
and Charlie Hoyt 16 for Rinc,
now 2-0.
The highly regarded and
ever-bragging Culos remained
undefeated with a resounding
forfeit victory over the
Osterrusches Funf — a team one
fun-loving Culo dubbed "The Five
Oste riches."
Elsewhere, Jacks or Better,
which presumably doesn't mean
Tresidder, waddled past Black
Armadillo, 45-22. Former
Stanford JV player Bill Whiting
scored 17 points to lead Jacks.
Jacks star Buz Burr was held to
two points but led the team in
"attempted offensive fouls
resulting in crashes to the court"
with 12.
Zap House, behind the expert
coaching of Mark Florant, and the
clutch free throw shooting of
Rich Gonzales, ousted the
Boathouse Ladies, 32-29.

In Soccer, SIDEC EDUC. I and
Biz I A 1 rolled through the first
two weeks of the Monday "A"

Sunday at 11 a.m.
Education has soundly
trounced its first two opponents,
Wildmen 4-1 and the Bogus Oaks
6-0. Biz I won overColumbae 6-0
and by forfeit over El Toro.
Other undefeateds include Biz
I A2,victorious over ATO 3-0 and
Otero 4-0. VFB Beutelsbach is

wins over Phi Psi and DU.

comeback this week after
absorbing a 136-16 thrashing at
the hands of Rinc 69 last week.
This time they only lost 64-12
Wednesday night against Trancos.
Sandy Feldman poured through
seven points in the maximum
effort for Gavilan.
Mark Green tossed in 20 to
lead Trancos and teammate Dale
Zeitlin added 16.
An hour later Rinc 69 scored
only half as many points as last
week and gave up twice as many
— which means they won 66-31
over the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band. Don Hunt had 25
and Charlie Hoyt 16 for Rinc,
now 2-0.
The highly regarded and
ever-bragging Culos remained
undefeated with a resounding
forfeit victory over the
Osterrusches Funf — a team one
fun-loving Culo dubbed "The Five
Oste riches."
Elsewhere, Jacks or Better,
which presumably doesn't mean
Tresidder, waddled past Black
Armadillo, 45-22. Former
Stanford JV player Bill Whiting
scored 17 points to lead Jacks.
Jacks star Buz Burr was held to
two points but led the team in
"attempted offensive fouls
resulting in crashes to the court"
with 12.
Zap House, behind the expert
coaching of Mark Florant, and the
clutch free throw shooting of
Rich Gonzales, ousted the
Boathouse Ladies, 32-29.
