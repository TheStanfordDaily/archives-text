# Won't Rest On Laurels
## Swimmers Return To Work 
### STEVE BAKER 
Stanford's swimming team
returned from its successful
eastern trip at 5:30 Monday
morning and immediately flopped
into bed. Although the Cards were
given Monday off to recover from
the exhausting travel, coach Jim
Gaughran's swimmers have little
time to rest on their laurels.
Last weekend saw the
Cardinals conquer Michigan 65-48
and decimate Yale 86-27. They
took nine of 13 events in Ann
Arbor and 11 of 13 in New
Haven. Considering fatigue from
travel and unfamiliarity with the
pools, the Cardinal performances
were creditable. "We had them
psyched out," Gaughran added.
But now the Cards are back
into heavy training. Starting at
6:30 a.m., the swimmers go for
two hours in the morning and two
hours in the afternoon. Gaughran
plans to have his charges swim
from 12,000 to 15,000 yards a
day for the next couple of weeks.
"We're going to be working hard,"
he understated.
There's a method to all this
madness, however. Although
Stanford's results were
encouraging last weekend, there
has been a lot of consternation
around the Stanford pools over
the performances of several
Indiana, USC and Washington
swimmers. Going into the
weekend's activities, the Cards
were ranked number one in six
events. By the end of the action,
they held only two.
Indiana, expected to take the

NCAA title for an unprecedented
seventh consecutive year,
captured four first place national
rankings, knocking Stanford
swimmers out of three of them.
The Hoosiers, led by sprinter Jim
Montgomery, have the nation's
fastest times in the 100 and 200
freestyle and both relays.
Montgomery ousted Stanford's
Dave Fairbank as the premier 100
man, recording a 45.48.
Montgomery also split an
incredible 44.74 in leading
Indiana's freestyle relay to a
clocking of 3:03.33. Hoosier Bill
Heiss leads the nation in the 200
free with a 1:39.8. USC's Scott
Brown took over John Hencken's
number-one ranking in the 200
individual medley. In the 200
backstroke, Trojan John Naber
broke the American record with a
1:49.6.
Washington's Rick DeMont
continued his domination in the
1000, dropping his time to a
9:23.0, while Husky Robin
Backhaus prevailed in the 200 fly
with a 1:51.1.
Train Hard
So Stanford's swimmers,
ranked sixth in the nation, must
train hard now if they hope to do
well in the NCAA championships
in March — indeed, if they hope
to stay in sight! The two Cardinals
still holding number-one rankings
are Fairbank in the 50, and
Hencken in the 200 breaststroke.
Both are Olympians.
Hencken said, "If that many
people do that good this early, the

times might go down even more
before the NCAA's. I have a
general policy of not setting any
goals for myself." John might
have added his general policy of
winning.
Today at 3 p.m. Stanford hosts
the Stanford Relays at the newly
named deGuerre Pools. Among
the teams competing are
California, Los Altos Aquatic
Club, Marin Aquatic Club and the
Santa Clara Swim Club. The Cards
should dominate, but with the
hard work and long hours they're
putting in now, no one expects
their best times. However,
everyone is hoping that it pays off
when Stanford peaks for the
NCAA's.

FLY ME—Stanford diver Wayne Wager soars through the air en route to a winning performance in the
three-meter diving against Washington. Wager will be flying again this afternoon at 3 p.m., when the Cards
host the annual Stanford Relays at the newly named deGuerre Pools.
Stanford's swimming team
returned from its successful
eastern trip at 5:30 Monday
morning and immediately flopped
into bed. Although the Cards were
given Monday off to recover from
the exhausting travel, coach Jim
Gaughran's swimmers have little
time to rest on their laurels.
Last weekend saw the
Cardinals conquer Michigan 65-48
and decimate Yale 86-27. They
took nine of 13 events in Ann
Arbor and 11 of 13 in New
Haven. Considering fatigue from
travel and unfamiliarity with the
pools, the Cardinal performances
were creditable. "We had them
psyched out," Gaughran added.
But now the Cards are back
into heavy training. Starting at
6:30 a.m., the swimmers go for
two hours in the morning and two
hours in the afternoon. Gaughran
plans to have his charges swim
from 12,000 to 15,000 yards a
day for the next couple of weeks.
"We're going to be working hard,"
he understated.
There's a method to all this
madness, however. Although
Stanford's results were
encouraging last weekend, there
has been a lot of consternation
around the Stanford pools over
the performances of several
Indiana, USC and Washington
swimmers. Going into the
weekend's activities, the Cards
were ranked number one in six
events. By the end of the action,
they held only two.
Indiana, expected to take the

NCAA title for an unprecedented
seventh consecutive year,
captured four first place national
rankings, knocking Stanford
swimmers out of three of them.
The Hoosiers, led by sprinter Jim
Montgomery, have the nation's
fastest times in the 100 and 200
freestyle and both relays.
Montgomery ousted Stanford's
Dave Fairbank as the premier 100
man, recording a 45.48.
Montgomery also split an
incredible 44.74 in leading
Indiana's freestyle relay to a
clocking of 3:03.33. Hoosier Bill
Heiss leads the nation in the 200
free with a 1:39.8. USC's Scott
Brown took over John Hencken's
number-one ranking in the 200
individual medley. In the 200
backstroke, Trojan John Naber
broke the American record with a
1:49.6.
Washington's Rick DeMont
continued his domination in the
1000, dropping his time to a
9:23.0, while Husky Robin
Backhaus prevailed in the 200 fly
with a 1:51.1.
Train Hard
So Stanford's swimmers,
ranked sixth in the nation, must
train hard now if they hope to do
well in the NCAA championships
in March — indeed, if they hope
to stay in sight! The two Cardinals
still holding number-one rankings
are Fairbank in the 50, and
Hencken in the 200 breaststroke.
Both are Olympians.
Hencken said, "If that many
people do that good this early, the
