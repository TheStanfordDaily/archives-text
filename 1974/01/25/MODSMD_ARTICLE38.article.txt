# JV Underdog Again Tonight
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
For Stanford's junior varsity
cagers this weekend, the
difference between San Jose State
and San Jose City colleges could
be more than what the names of
the two schools imply. The
disparity could be one of winning
and losing.
Not that winning a basketball
game is such an all-important goal
for this JV team, a group of
walk-ons which has surprised most
everyone with its 3-4 record
against teams which in every case,
Stanford coach Billy Jones said
before the season, had better
personnel than the Cardinals.
So the record Stanford takes
into its 6 p.m. meeting with the
San Jose State JV tonight at
Maples Pavilion is not so
unrespectable. And few would be
surprised or disappointed if the
record were 3-5 when the Cards
travel to San Jose City for an 8
p.m. game tomorrow.
The reason is recruiting. The
Spartan JV sports freshman Grady
Roberts, an All-City star from Los
Angeles whom Jones lists at 6-7.
Along with Roberts, Jones says,
are "several scholarship kids" who
give the Spartans plenty of "size."
Jones fears the entire San Jose
starting line-up may be recruits.
No Recruits
Stanford, one may remember,
has no recruits. The Cards do have
6-8 center Scott Russell to
counteract Roberts. Russell stands
five inches above the nearest Card
regular, so naturally leads the
squad in rebounds, and is second
in scoring average at 12 points per

game.
Russell and the team's leading
scorer, guard Terry McCartin
(13-point average—, both have
proved exceptions to Jones's
pre-season statement that none of
the JV's was of varsity potential.
"In Terry McCartin I see a guy
who could [make varsity] if he
gets stronger," says the coach
now. "Russell has a chance
eventually."
Jones credits the surprising
start of his entire club to "hard
work." He says the Cards have
shown "we can run .. . we're a
pretty good shootin' ball club."
Rebounding Problems
Rebounding, outside of Russell
and reserve Sven Walker, remains
a problem. He says forwards like
6-3 Marty Moroski "can't get to
the board in time from the wing
spots" but that "on defense they
should all get more."
On this weekend, however, he
expects the cagers to play "pretty
much the same. They don't
change much." Jones says that
standout reserves Walker and
Moroski won't crack the starting
line-up because "I don't believe in
changing lineups. Starting isn't
important to me."
The roster, as is, should be
enough against San Jose City
tomorrow night. Jones says
Stanford scrimmaged San Jose last
year and found City college to be
"pretty damn competitive" and
"scrappy" but that they are
barely above .500 this season.
Underdogs against San Jose
State tonight, the young Cardinals
can take heart that under similar

circumstances this season, they
have come through with clutch
performances.
"Take a team like Menlo
[College]," Jones says. "On paper
we shouldn't even have been in
the gym with them." Stanford
battled the defending JC champs
into two overtimes before losing
66-58.

scorer, guard Terry McCartin
(13-point average—, both have
proved exceptions to Jones's
pre-season statement that none of
the JV's was of varsity potential.
"In Terry McCartin I see a guy
who could [make varsity] if he
gets stronger," says the coach
now. "Russell has a chance
eventually."
Jones credits the surprising
start of his entire club to "hard
work." He says the Cards have
shown "we can run .. . we're a
pretty good shootin' ball club."
Rebounding Problems
Rebounding, outside of Russell
and reserve Sven Walker, remains
a problem. He says forwards like
6-3 Marty Moroski "can't get to
the board in time from the wing
spots" but that "on defense they
should all get more."
On this weekend, however, he
expects the cagers to play "pretty
much the same. They don't
change much." Jones says that
standout reserves Walker and
Moroski won't crack the starting
line-up because "I don't believe in
changing lineups. Starting isn't
important to me."
The roster, as is, should be
enough against San Jose City
tomorrow night. Jones says
Stanford scrimmaged San Jose last
year and found City college to be
"pretty damn competitive" and
"scrappy" but that they are
barely above .500 this season.
Underdogs against San Jose
State tonight, the young Cardinals
can take heart that under similar

circumstances this season, they
have come through with clutch
performances.
"Take a team like Menlo
[College]," Jones says. "On paper
we shouldn't even have been in
the gym with them." Stanford
battled the defending JC champs
into two overtimes before losing
66-58.
For Stanford's junior varsity
cagers this weekend, the
difference between San Jose State
and San Jose City colleges could
be more than what the names of
the two schools imply. The
disparity could be one of winning
and losing.
Not that winning a basketball
game is such an all-important goal
for this JV team, a group of
walk-ons which has surprised most
everyone with its 3-4 record
against teams which in every case,
Stanford coach Billy Jones said
before the season, had better
personnel than the Cardinals.
So the record Stanford takes
into its 6 p.m. meeting with the
San Jose State JV tonight at
Maples Pavilion is not so
unrespectable. And few would be
surprised or disappointed if the
record were 3-5 when the Cards
travel to San Jose City for an 8
p.m. game tomorrow.
The reason is recruiting. The
Spartan JV sports freshman Grady
Roberts, an All-City star from Los
Angeles whom Jones lists at 6-7.
Along with Roberts, Jones says,
are "several scholarship kids" who
give the Spartans plenty of "size."
Jones fears the entire San Jose
starting line-up may be recruits.
No Recruits
Stanford, one may remember,
has no recruits. The Cards do have
6-8 center Scott Russell to
counteract Roberts. Russell stands
five inches above the nearest Card
regular, so naturally leads the
squad in rebounds, and is second
in scoring average at 12 points per

game.
Russell and the team's leading
scorer, guard Terry McCartin
(13-point average—, both have
proved exceptions to Jones's
pre-season statement that none of
the JV's was of varsity potential.
