# Shuffling The Cards
## Conspirators 
### Dave Robinson 
The following persons, places and things have been indicted as
conspirators in the Stanford Basketball Scandal, which currently
includes a six-game losing streak and threatens to destroy the moral
fibers of the Stanford community.
— William Friedkin's movie TTie Exorcist, which inflicted
irreparable psychological damage on forwards Ed Schweitzer and
Scott Trobbe and guard Mike Simons.
— Wayne and Willard Smith, a set of twins who officiated during
Stanford's 78-77 loss to Kentucky in the finals of the Kentucky
Classic. The Smith brothers, who used their Southern drawls as much
as their whistles, eventually forced the unplanned exit of Rich Kelley
(five fouls), Tim Patterson (five fouls) and Dave Frost (five fouls and
one technical foul). The twins' performance elicited the following
response from coach Howie Dallmar: "Those two little %s&*%!."
They also created a year-long Stanford aversion to referees.
— Madison Square Garden Center, whose officers subjected the
Cardinals to the indignity of playing in front of 19,350 empty seats at
the ungodly hour of 10:30 a.m. in a consolation game of the ECAC
Holiday Festival.
— Athletic Director Joe Ruetz, who silenced constant critic KZSU
by taking away its broadcast rights just when the station's team of
investigative reporters was about to expose the entire scandal and its
causes.
* — The New York Times, a supposedly reputable newspaper, which
proclaimed Stanford "second best in the West," first causing false
confidence and then causing general distrust of the media.
— The entire fraternity of New York City cab drivers, who several
times forced Stanford players to prematurely experience the shock of
impending death.
— Street and Smith's, Basketball Digest, Sports Illustrated and
countless other publications that picked Stanford to finish in the first
division of the Pac-8.
— Lexington, Ky.
— The Maples Pavilion floor, which several times has collided with
Rich Kelley, causing back and wrist injuries as well as continual
frustration.
— Director of Operations Pete Kmetovic, who failed to impose
price controls on Maples concessions, keeping the fans unsatiated and
angry.
— Colorado State center Como (Bruiser) Pontliana, whose habit of
pushing, shoving and fouling out of games inspired Stanford's players
to adopt similar methods.
— Madame Mao, who convinced Kelley of the values of the Chinese
philosophy "Friendship first, competition second." Kelley then
relayed the message to his teammates, and Stanford is now both the
friendliest and losingest team in the Pac-8.
— Manager Mark Florant, who caused financial insecurity after an
alleged $200 pickpocket theft when the team changed planes at
O'Hare Airport. There have been charges, however, that Florant hid
the money in now-departed Dave Frost's locker and plans a vacation
to Hawaii after the season.
— Sports Information Director Bob Murphy, who escaped to
Mexico as the scandal assumed monumental proportions and became
newsworthy.
— Sports Information Secretary Jean Zwicky, who mysteriously
erased an 18-turnover segment of the weekly statistics.
— The athletic department plumbers, who were responsible for
inconsistent hot water flow in the locker room showers.
— The Red Vest Band, a subsidiary of the LSJUMB, which diverted
attention away from the basketball court and contributed to a general
trend of moral decay.
— Coaches Howie Dallmar, Bub Bowling and Billy Jones, who must
accept all of the responsibility but none of the blame.
— Stanford Daily sports editor Dave Robinson, who continually
published glowing praise about the Cardinals, causing a false sense of
security and confidence for players and coaches. Even worse,
Robinson has maintained his Ehrlichman-like staunchness, predicting
a Stanford victory tonight against Denver.
