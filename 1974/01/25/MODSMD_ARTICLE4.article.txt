# 'Chappie', 'Live Oak' Funds Held
## Publications Board Allots Money 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The ASSU Publications Board
yesterday approved the disbursement
of $3000 to eight existing and planned
publications. But following stormy
debate on the financial viability of the
proposed newspaper Live Oak, the
board delayed consideration of giving
$1500 to either that publication or the
Chaparral. The Board also approved
$800 in loans to two publications.
The Pub Board funding review
committee's suggested disbursement of
$3000, as outlined in yesterday's
Daily, was accepted by a 10-1 vote
after one hour's debate at the meeting,
held in Tresidder 267-8.
The lone dissenter, Chaparral
Publisher Mark Lee, held the floor for
much of the hour, objecting to the
proposal on three grounds, including
his argument that the funding review
committee had no written set of

criteria on which to base its proposals.
Lee found little support for any of
his positions, and the committee's
original proposals were accepted.
The Pub Board then debated the
merits of loaning $300 to Disciplines,
a book of poetry. Although the
committee voted 4-1 against giving the
book any financial support, the Pub
Board voted 5-4 to loan the money
contingent on a financial review by
Daily Business Manager Mike Kruger.
The next item on the agenda called
for a decision on the question of
whether $1500 would be given to the
Chaparral, to Live Oak, to both, or to
neither. Daily Editor Jim Wascher
moved that the Pub Board delay
consideration of the grant to Live Oak
pending a more detailed knowledge of
its financing.
Bill Weinstein, who will be Live
Oak's editor if the weekly paper begins

publication, objected to this proposal,
saying "this would mean postponing
us out of existence," because, he said,
Live Oak would today have received
$2700 in funds from alumni sources
contingent on getting the $1500 from
the Pub Board.
Kruger then got the floor and
questioned the validity of Weinstein's
financial statement, saying that,
according to his figures, Live Oak,
even using Weinstein's predictions of
alumni support, would still run $5000
in the red next year.
Weinstein and Kruger then had a
brief but heated discussion concerning
Sherry Bronski, the Daily bookkeeper,
whom Weinstein said he had hired.
Real News Editor 800 Bacon
interrupted this argument, urging
adjournment for one week. Chairman
Gordon Imrie agreed and the argument
was at least temporarily postponed.
