# Cards Hope To Snap Loss Streak
## 
### 
Hoping to brake a six-game
losing skid, Stanford hosts Denver
tonight in an 8 p.m. game at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cards, now 5-9 on the
season, haven't won since Dec. 28,
when they upended St. Louis in a
10:30 a.m. consolation game of
the ECAC Holiday Festival. That
game was played before 150
sleepy spectators at Madison
Square Garden.
Since then, it's been a long
nightmare for the Cards, who have
turned the ball over nearly 25
times a game during the loss
streak. Last weekend was the
ultimate in frustration, as

Stanford committed 31 miscues in
a 91-82 loss to Utah and then
dropped a 75-58 decision to a
group of scrappy midgets from
Air Force.
"I certainly can't criticize the
team's efforts," said Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar. 'They've
played hard. We realize it's been
as frustrating for them as it has
for us."
Denver, tonight's opponent,
has had a similarly frustrating
season. The Pioneers are 7-9
overall, having lost seven of their
last 10 games. (The Cards are
eight for nine.)
Denver does have a pair of
individual standouts, however.
Forward John Johnson (6-8) is a
statistician's dream, averaging
23.8 points and 10.6 rebounds a
game while shooting 52.3 percent
from the field and 83.8 from the
line. Guard Len Orr adds balance
to the high-powered Denver
offense with an 18.0 average.
As a team, the Pioneers are
scoring 80.9 points a game,
compared to only 64.0 for
Stanford. Defensively, however,

Denver has yielded an 83.6
average while the Cards are giving
up 65.4.
Denver features a fast-break
offense and a pressing,
man-to-man defense. Dallmar will
counter with Stanford's usual
array of defenses, often switching
from man-to-man to a variety of
zones. Offensively, Dallmar hopes
the starting lineup of Rich Kelley,
Tim Patterson, Ed Schweitzer,
Melvin Arterberry and Ben Bluitt
can match Saturday night's
82-point performance against
Utah.
Schweitzer scored 22 points in
that game, while Kelley chipped
in 17 and Bluitt added 12.
* Cardinal Notes: Stanford,
which posted a 14-11 record a
year ago, needs to win nine of its
remaining 11 games to match that
status. At least one player,
though, thinks the Cards will
surpass last year's mark. "We'll
win 10 more games," predicts
guard Ben Bluitt.
Kelley continues to lead the
Cardinals in three statistical
categories. In last weekend's
games he scored 42 points and
grabbed 39 rebounds, upping his
season averages to 17.4 and 12.8
respectively. Kelley also leads in
fouls with 50.
With 243 points, Kelley is well
on his way to making his second
entry in Stanford's mythical
'400-point Club.' The Club
currently has 15 members.
Tonight's contest marks the
first of four consecutive games at
Maples. Next Friday Stanford
hosts California, and Washington
and Washington State visit the
Bay Area the following weekend.

first of four consecutive games at
Maples. Next Friday Stanford
hosts California, and Washington
and Washington State visit the
Bay Area the following weekend.
Hoping to brake a six-game
losing skid, Stanford hosts Denver
tonight in an 8 p.m. game at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cards, now 5-9 on the
season, haven't won since Dec. 28,
when they upended St. Louis in a
10:30 a.m. consolation game of
the ECAC Holiday Festival. That
game was played before 150
sleepy spectators at Madison
Square Garden.
Since then, it's been a long
nightmare for the Cards, who have
turned the ball over nearly 25
times a game during the loss
streak. Last weekend was the
ultimate in frustration, as

Stanford committed 31 miscues in
a 91-82 loss to Utah and then
dropped a 75-58 decision to a
group of scrappy midgets from
Air Force.
"I certainly can't criticize the
team's efforts," said Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar. 'They've
played hard. We realize it's been
as frustrating for them as it has
for us."
Denver, tonight's opponent,
has had a similarly frustrating
season. The Pioneers are 7-9
overall, having lost seven of their
last 10 games. (The Cards are
eight for nine.)
Denver does have a pair of
individual standouts, however.
Forward John Johnson (6-8) is a
statistician's dream, averaging
23.8 points and 10.6 rebounds a
game while shooting 52.3 percent
from the field and 83.8 from the
line. Guard Len Orr adds balance
to the high-powered Denver
offense with an 18.0 average.
As a team, the Pioneers are
scoring 80.9 points a game,
compared to only 64.0 for
Stanford. Defensively, however,

Denver has yielded an 83.6
average while the Cards are giving
up 65.4.
Denver features a fast-break
offense and a pressing,
man-to-man defense. Dallmar will
counter with Stanford's usual
array of defenses, often switching
from man-to-man to a variety of
zones. Offensively, Dallmar hopes
the starting lineup of Rich Kelley,
Tim Patterson, Ed Schweitzer,
Melvin Arterberry and Ben Bluitt
can match Saturday night's
82-point performance against
Utah.
Schweitzer scored 22 points in
that game, while Kelley chipped
in 17 and Bluitt added 12.
* Cardinal Notes: Stanford,
which posted a 14-11 record a
year ago, needs to win nine of its
remaining 11 games to match that
status. At least one player,
though, thinks the Cards will
surpass last year's mark. "We'll
win 10 more games," predicts
guard Ben Bluitt.
Kelley continues to lead the
Cardinals in three statistical
categories. In last weekend's
games he scored 42 points and
grabbed 39 rebounds, upping his
season averages to 17.4 and 12.8
respectively. Kelley also leads in
fouls with 50.
With 243 points, Kelley is well
on his way to making his second
entry in Stanford's mythical
'400-point Club.' The Club
currently has 15 members.
