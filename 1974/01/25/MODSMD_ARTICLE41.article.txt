# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
The Daily's fearless
forecaster, who took it in the
shorts last weekend with only
two correct predictions in six
games (his season record fell
to 16-11), is so distraught
that he is threatening to quit
his job.
More precisely, if he
doesn't correctly predict at
least five of this week's seven
games, he will yield to Lola,
last year's marvelous mystic
who had a similar midseason
slump in 1973. Lola,
however, has waxed her
crystal ball and feels
confident that she can make a
comeback in 1974.
Except for a few brief
words about the UCLA-Notre
Dame rematch (UCLA will
win handily), the rest of this
column will be devoted to a
couple of Pac-8 sidelights,

Washington coach, grew a
handsome mustache last year
during the off season, but
chopped it off after the
Huskies lost their fourth
straight Pac-8 game. "It
wasn't, as someone suggested,
that I was aiming for my
throat and missed," growls
Marv.
George Raveling,
Washington State coach, was
asked about Steve Puidokas,
his prize 6-11½, 258-pound
freshman. "Where does he
shoot from," quizzed a fan.
"Wherever he wants," replied
Raveling.
And now, possibly for the
last time, here are the weekly
predictions:
UCLA 101, Santa Clara 75
Stanford 76, Denver 70
Oregon St. 71, Oregon 70
UCLA 80, Notre Dame 66
Cat 72, San Jose St. 65
Washington 64, Seattle 57
USC 78, Fordham 68
