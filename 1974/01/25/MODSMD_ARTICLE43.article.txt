# Veteran Golfers Open 1974 Season
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Hoping to lend truth to the rumor that upperclassmen are poised,
cool and nerveless, Stanford's junior-laden golf team opens its 1974
season this afternoon against California.
Four of the six starters for today's 12 noon match at Franklin
Canyon Country Club are juniors, and all four competed on talented
but disappointing Card squads the past two years.
As freshmen, those players compared an impressive 11-1-2 dual
match record but slumped in the major tournaments, finishing third in
the Pac-B's and 19th in the NCAA's.
Last year marked another inconsistent campaign, this time for a
group of unpredictable sophomores who placed second in the
conference but missed the cut at the NCAA's.
Now, Stanford's juniors hope the painful experience will mean
stability — and possibly national prominence — for the 1974 Card
golfers.
"We've got the talent," said Dave Baskins, one of those third-year
starters, "but we have to prove our consistency. If we can get four
players to come through each tournament, I think we can beat
anybody." Top Ten Performer

Baskins has already proven that
he car) beat almost anybody,
having defeated Walker Cupper
Mark Pfeil in the second round of
the U.S. Amateur this summer.
Baskins also finished in the top 10
in five of the seven major
collegiate tournaments Stanford
entered last year, including a
second place effort behind U.S.
Amateur champion Craig Stadler
in the Pac-8 Southern Division
tournament.
Baskins earned honorable
mention All-American recognition
for those performances, but he is
only one of two Card
Ail-Americans. Joining him in that
elite status is Conrad Nilmeier,
last year's champion in Stanford's
U.S. Collegiate Invitational
tournament.
A third solid starter is Aly
Trompas, the 1969 U.S. Junior
champion and an explosive,
though inconsistent performer in
his two varsity seasons. Baskins,
Nilmeier and Trompas were all
exempt from intra-squad
qualifying this year.
The remaining three starting
spots for today's match were
determined by an extensive
99-hole qualifying test conducted
the last two weekends on
Stanford's tough and soggy
layout.
Qualifying Leader
Junior George Pattinger, a
part-time starter last year, coasted
to an easy victory in the
qualifying with a 15-over-par 411
total. Pettinger fired rounds of
79-70-74-75-76 and 37 in one
abbreviated nine-hole test to
finish 10 strokes ahead of
runnerup Glenn Goethels. Tom
Mason was third at 422.
Goethels, a freshman from
Princeton, N.J., qualified for the
U.S. Amateur this summer, where
he won his opening match before
bowing in the second round.
Mason, a sophomore from
Hawaii, is a transfer from Menlo
College. He was number-one man
for the Oaks last year.
Those six men comprise a
lineup that is experienced,
talented and hopefully solid. "The
key will be a little more individual
work than in the past," said
Nilmeier. "If we can build up our
confidence this quarter, it should
pay off in the big tournaments
this spring."
The Cards will compete
sparingly this quarter and devote
most of spring quarter to a series
of major tournaments,
highlighted by the Pac-8
championships here at Stanford in
mid-day.
