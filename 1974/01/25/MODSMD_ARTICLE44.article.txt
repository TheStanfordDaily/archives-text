Carroll Williams, head coach of
the Santa Clara Broncos, takes his
team south for a basketball game
virtually unnoticed in the
UCLA-Notre Dame Ballyhoo.
The Broncos (6-10), catch the
UCLA Bruins on the rebound in
tonight's game at Pauley Pavilion,
and Williams doesn't feel the
71-70 UCLA defeat last Saturday
at Notre Dame makes the now
number-two-ranked Bruins any
easier.
"UCLA is the same team that
won 88 straight," he said. "The
Bruins will be out to start a new
streak against us."
UCLA Coach John Wooden
intends to take a one-game
winning streak and 14-1 record
into the rematch Saturday night
with the top-ranked Fighting Irish
at Pauley Pavilion, where the
Bruins have won 58 straight games
and 124 of 126.
"We must not forget we play
Santa Clara Friday night," said
Wooden, "and we try to keep
each game in proper perspective.
"We are working on our
offense against a man-to-man
pressing defense and on our
rebounding," said Wooden, who
denied that the over-all work is
tougher than usual in preparing
for Notre Dame.
"Although I believe both
categories will improve if Bill
Walton is back to being all right,
we must still give attention to
improvement," Wooden said.
