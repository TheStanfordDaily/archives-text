"Plumber' Krogh To Serve Jail Term
WASHINGTON — Egil Krogh Jr., repentent but asking
no favors, was sentenced yesterday to serve six months in
prison for his part in the Ellsberg case burglary. He said
President Nixon did not authorize it "directly or
indirectly."
Krogh, supervisor of the White House agents who carried
out the office break-in, thus discounted reports that his
marching orders had come "right out of the Oval Office."
He said he had only one contact with President Nixon
on the work of the special investigations unit known as the
"plumbers" and in "that meeting Dr. Ellsberg's name did
not appear to be mentioned."
But he said that John D. Ehrlichman, then the
President's domestic adviser and Krogh's superior, gave the
unit authority to engage in "covert activity to obtain
information on Dr. Ellsberg."
Loeal Gas Station To Close?
SAN JOSE — Santa Clara County service station
operators, angered by what they consider failure by the
federal government to grant them a greater profit margin,
plan to shut down indefinitely at midnight Feb. 1, a
spokesman said yesterday.
Paul Finch, spokesman for the National Service Station
Dealers Association, said the government is stalling
implementation of price relief to the gasoline dealers.
About 600 of the 800 service stations in Santa Clara
County are members of the National Service Station
Dealers Association, which was organized five months ago
in San Jose.

Finch said the strike will remain in effect until the
operators demand for a 25 percent margin of profit on the
selling price of gasoline is approved by the government.
The dealers had threatened to strike earlier this year but
it was averted Jan. 5 when the Federal Energy Office
secured a 1 cent per gallon across the board increase for
dealers and promised a "fair shake" in the future.
Israel Speeds Withdrawal
TEL AVIV — Israel sped up its military pullback
yesterday in Egypt, and Cairo will make its first negotiated
withdrawal along the Suez Canal front today, the United
Nations Emergency Force commander said.
Full-scale Israeli withdrawal from the west side of the
Suez Canal and the first Egyptian movement from the east
side is based on a technical military' document signed
yesterday on the Cairo-Suez road, said the commander of
the U.N. force, Lt. Gen. Ensio Siilasvuo of Finland.
Israeli forces began withdrawing Wednesday from the
west side of the canal while the Egyptian and Israeli chiefs
of staff still were discussing the technical document.
The document was signed by Lt. Gen. David Elazar of
Israel, and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Abdel Ghany Gamasy of
Egypt, the two countries' chiefs of staff.
They had met in a U.N. tent on the Cairo-Suez road to
tie up any loose ends to the major military disengagement
agreements signed last week. Separation of the two armies
could lead to full peace talks.
Demos Push Oil Price Cut
WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats expressed strong
support yesterday for a proposal to roll back the price of
domestic crude oil.
The support was voiced at a closed party caucus,
senators reported later. However, action on the matter was
delayed by the caucus pending hearings by the Senate
Finance Committee.
Meanwhile, the Senate agreed to vote next Tuesday on
an emergency energy bill stalled since before Christmas.
Among other things, the measure would give President
Nixon authority to order gasoline rationing.
In another energy-related development yesterday,
federal energy chief William E. Simon criticized a proposal
to impose a $5-billion annual tax on U.S. energy
production. The tax, proposed by Sen. Mike Gravel,
D-Alaska, would raise funds for an Energy Trust Fund to
finance government projects to boost energy production.
Simon, testifying before a Senate finance subcommittee,
said the tax would add to inflationary pressures, causing
price hikes of 5 percent on oil and 13 percent on the less
expensive grades of coal.
