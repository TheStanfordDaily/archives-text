# New Accelerators Could Aid SLAC Research
## 
### KEVIN FLYNN 
Stanford scientists probing the nature of matter may
have two powerful new tools in the next few years. One, a
160-foot accelerator buried 35 feet below Hansen Labs on
the campus, has begun partial operations and should be
reaching its full, 700 million electron volt strength by the
end of 1975.
Another, far more powerful accelerator, is the $55
million Proton-Electron-Positron (PEP) ring planned as an
addition to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
That ring is still in the formative stages of planning; last
week, SLAC and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
announced a joint study to prepare a proposal for the
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to establsh the project.
Construction would begin in 1975.
In another development at SLAC last week, technicians
continued installing two new computers worth more than
$12 million, to handle the vast amount of data presently
generated by the accelerator.
High Voltages
SLAC's proposed ring would generate more than 15
billion electron volts, bringing subatomic particles into
collision with each other at voltages far higher than
presently possible.
The project would be a major expansion of the facilities
at SLAC, increasing the staff by some 20 percent to 1200 —
about the size of the staff before recent budget cuts.
The diameter of the planned ring is 300 meters, more
than a third of a mile. Its underground tunnel would use up
most of the available land at SLAC's end station, and may
require a 10-acre addition to the SLAC site.
Joint Proposal
Senior SLAC Research Associate John Rees, director of
the study for the new PEP ring, said "the project is a joint
proposal to the AEC, between Berkeley and SLAC.
Basically, it's pre-construction research."
The proposed ring is essentially the same type as

another, smaller accelerator now in operation at SLAC.
That ring brings particles from the two-mile linear
accelerator into collision at 2.5 billion volts, and is
presently the world's most powerful electron-positron ring.
However, by the end of this year, a 4.2 billion volt ring
will begin operations in Hamburg, Germany. To keep up
with the ever-increasing energies needed to dig deeper into
subatomic particle behavior, SLAC is scheduling an
expansion of its smaller ring this year.
In recent years, the collision of high energy particles has
produced some of the most rewarding research in
electromagnetic physics.
"The collisions of electrons and positrons," Rees said,
"cause them to annihilate — into a stage of pure energy for
a brief instant of time." The electrons and positrons, he
adds, "reincarnate into a different assembly of particles,
such as pi-mesons and k-mesons."
The mysterious effects of high energy physics fascinate
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian, acting director of the Hansen
Labs. "We've discovered a nuclear zoo of different
particles," he said.
"We're searching for some order in the classification of
the particles." Referring to the early days of nuclear
research, he said "We're at about the same stage as atomic
physics was in the 1920's — a very exciting time.
Valuable Experiments
SLAC's experiments during the past few years with its
small ring have proved exceptionally valuable. When
particles are accelerated, their added momentum makes
even the smallest particle relatively massive, said Rees.
Thus, bringing highly accelerated particles into collision
with stationary particles is "like the collision of a bowling
ball with a ping-pong ball," he commented.
"But when both particles are accelerated, and going in
opposite directions — that's like the collision of two
bowling balls," Rees adds. In high-energy physics, those

particles are going at virtually the speed of light.
Present accelerators like SLAC's facilities generate huge
amounts of data. This week, experts from IBM were busily
installing a massive new computer system: a set of two IBM
370/168 machines.
The computers — some of IBM's most powerful products
— allow scientists to monitor accelerator experiments as
they happen. Presently, vast amounts of data are collected,
then analyzed. The old computer, an IBM 360 (roughly
similar to the campus facility) was nearly overworked
analyzing the data, says T.Y. Johnston, director of SLAC's
programming.
"Even with the two new computers," said Johnston,
"we won't be able to do all the analysis as we collect the
data. There simply isn't enough computing power. The
amount of data generated by an accelerator like SLAC's is
rather astonishing."
Johnston calculated that by running one part of SLAC
for a month would result in 3000 reels of high-density
computer tape. "A lot of data," he said.

proposal to the AEC, between Berkeley and SLAC.
Basically, it's pre-construction research."
The proposed ring is essentially the same type as

another, smaller accelerator now in operation at SLAC.
That ring brings particles from the two-mile linear
accelerator into collision at 2.5 billion volts, and is
presently the world's most powerful electron-positron ring.
However, by the end of this year, a 4.2 billion volt ring
will begin operations in Hamburg, Germany. To keep up
with the ever-increasing energies needed to dig deeper into
subatomic particle behavior, SLAC is scheduling an
expansion of its smaller ring this year.
In recent years, the collision of high energy particles has
produced some of the most rewarding research in
electromagnetic physics.
"The collisions of electrons and positrons," Rees said,
"cause them to annihilate — into a stage of pure energy for
a brief instant of time." The electrons and positrons, he
adds, "reincarnate into a different assembly of particles,
such as pi-mesons and k-mesons."
The mysterious effects of high energy physics fascinate
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian, acting director of the Hansen
Labs. "We've discovered a nuclear zoo of different
particles," he said.
"We're searching for some order in the classification of
the particles." Referring to the early days of nuclear
research, he said "We're at about the same stage as atomic
physics was in the 1920's — a very exciting time.
Valuable Experiments
SLAC's experiments during the past few years with its
small ring have proved exceptionally valuable. When
particles are accelerated, their added momentum makes
even the smallest particle relatively massive, said Rees.
Thus, bringing highly accelerated particles into collision
with stationary particles is "like the collision of a bowling
ball with a ping-pong ball," he commented.
"But when both particles are accelerated, and going in
opposite directions — that's like the collision of two
bowling balls," Rees adds. In high-energy physics, those

particles are going at virtually the speed of light.
Present accelerators like SLAC's facilities generate huge
amounts of data. This week, experts from IBM were busily
installing a massive new computer system: a set of two IBM
370/168 machines.
The computers — some of IBM's most powerful products
— allow scientists to monitor accelerator experiments as
they happen. Presently, vast amounts of data are collected,
then analyzed. The old computer, an IBM 360 (roughly
similar to the campus facility) was nearly overworked
analyzing the data, says T.Y. Johnston, director of SLAC's
programming.
"Even with the two new computers," said Johnston,
"we won't be able to do all the analysis as we collect the
data. There simply isn't enough computing power. The
amount of data generated by an accelerator like SLAC's is
rather astonishing."
Johnston calculated that by running one part of SLAC
for a month would result in 3000 reels of high-density
computer tape. "A lot of data," he said.
Stanford scientists probing the nature of matter may
have two powerful new tools in the next few years. One, a
160-foot accelerator buried 35 feet below Hansen Labs on
the campus, has begun partial operations and should be
reaching its full, 700 million electron volt strength by the
end of 1975.
Another, far more powerful accelerator, is the $55
million Proton-Electron-Positron (PEP) ring planned as an
addition to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
That ring is still in the formative stages of planning; last
week, SLAC and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
announced a joint study to prepare a proposal for the
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to establsh the project.
Construction would begin in 1975.
In another development at SLAC last week, technicians
continued installing two new computers worth more than
$12 million, to handle the vast amount of data presently
generated by the accelerator.
High Voltages
SLAC's proposed ring would generate more than 15
billion electron volts, bringing subatomic particles into
collision with each other at voltages far higher than
presently possible.
The project would be a major expansion of the facilities
at SLAC, increasing the staff by some 20 percent to 1200 —
about the size of the staff before recent budget cuts.
The diameter of the planned ring is 300 meters, more
than a third of a mile. Its underground tunnel would use up
most of the available land at SLAC's end station, and may
require a 10-acre addition to the SLAC site.

Thus, bringing highly accelerated particles into collision
with stationary particles is "like the collision of a bowling
ball with a ping-pong ball," he commented.
"But when both particles are accelerated, and going in
opposite directions — that's like the collision of two
bowling balls," Rees adds. In high-energy physics, those

particles are going at virtually the speed of light.
Present accelerators like SLAC's facilities generate huge
amounts of data. This week, experts from IBM were busily
installing a massive new computer system: a set of two IBM
370/168 machines.
The computers — some of IBM's most powerful products
— allow scientists to monitor accelerator experiments as
they happen. Presently, vast amounts of data are collected,
then analyzed. The old computer, an IBM 360 (roughly
similar to the campus facility) was nearly overworked
analyzing the data, says T.Y. Johnston, director of SLAC's
programming.
"Even with the two new computers," said Johnston,
"we won't be able to do all the analysis as we collect the
data. There simply isn't enough computing power. The
amount of data generated by an accelerator like SLAC's is
rather astonishing."
Johnston calculated that by running one part of SLAC
for a month would result in 3000 reels of high-density
computer tape. "A lot of data," he said.
Stanford scientists probing the nature of matter may
have two powerful new tools in the next few years. One, a
160-foot accelerator buried 35 feet below Hansen Labs on
the campus, has begun partial operations and should be
reaching its full, 700 million electron volt strength by the
end of 1975.
Another, far more powerful accelerator, is the $55
million Proton-Electron-Positron (PEP) ring planned as an
addition to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
That ring is still in the formative stages of planning; last
week, SLAC and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
announced a joint study to prepare a proposal for the
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to establsh the project.
Construction would begin in 1975.
In another development at SLAC last week, technicians
continued installing two new computers worth more than
$12 million, to handle the vast amount of data presently
generated by the accelerator.
High Voltages
SLAC's proposed ring would generate more than 15
billion electron volts, bringing subatomic particles into
collision with each other at voltages far higher than
presently possible.
The project would be a major expansion of the facilities
at SLAC, increasing the staff by some 20 percent to 1200 —
about the size of the staff before recent budget cuts.
The diameter of the planned ring is 300 meters, more
than a third of a mile. Its underground tunnel would use up
most of the available land at SLAC's end station, and may
require a 10-acre addition to the SLAC site.
Joint Proposal
Senior SLAC Research Associate John Rees, director of
the study for the new PEP ring, said "the project is a joint
proposal to the AEC, between Berkeley and SLAC.
Basically, it's pre-construction research."
The proposed ring is essentially the same type as

another, smaller accelerator now in operation at SLAC.
That ring brings particles from the two-mile linear
accelerator into collision at 2.5 billion volts, and is
presently the world's most powerful electron-positron ring.
However, by the end of this year, a 4.2 billion volt ring
will begin operations in Hamburg, Germany. To keep up
with the ever-increasing energies needed to dig deeper into
subatomic particle behavior, SLAC is scheduling an
expansion of its smaller ring this year.
In recent years, the collision of high energy particles has
produced some of the most rewarding research in
electromagnetic physics.
"The collisions of electrons and positrons," Rees said,
"cause them to annihilate — into a stage of pure energy for
a brief instant of time." The electrons and positrons, he
adds, "reincarnate into a different assembly of particles,
such as pi-mesons and k-mesons."
The mysterious effects of high energy physics fascinate
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian, acting director of the Hansen
Labs. "We've discovered a nuclear zoo of different
particles," he said.
"We're searching for some order in the classification of
the particles." Referring to the early days of nuclear
research, he said "We're at about the same stage as atomic
physics was in the 1920's — a very exciting time.
Valuable Experiments
SLAC's experiments during the past few years with its
small ring have proved exceptionally valuable. When
particles are accelerated, their added momentum makes
even the smallest particle relatively massive, said Rees.

with stationary particles is "like the collision of a bowling
