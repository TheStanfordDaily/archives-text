## On Education 
### 
University President Richard Lyman broke a precedent last week
by becoming the first President infiveyears to address a student body
assembly.
We commend his initiative in speaking to the students, in
delivering his "State of the University" message, and hope to see
more presidential addresses directed toward students in the months
to come.
However, while we applaud Lyman for his forthright approach,
we must look askance at his actual message to the students. Lyman
did not tell the audience anything it did not already know and thus
we feel that his speech served more as an instrument for mere public
relations than as a true effort to extend communication.
In extolling the virtues of a liberal education, Lyman called
attention to the strict requirements of professional schools in
technical fields. He called for "breadth of view and length of
perspective." Lyman also criticized the attitudes of some students in
having a shallow approach to their Stanford education by selecting
courses only in consideration of their meeting times, easy grades, or
friends in the courses.
Wc share these viewpoints with President Lyman. However,
Lyman gave the students pursuing pre-professional training here at
Stanford very few solutions to the curricuiar demands imposed on
them by narrow-minded graduate schools.
While Lyman calls for pre-med students to enhance their minds
with courses not essential to the biology core, medical school
admission standards become tougher and tougher. In short,
pre-professional students are given little choice but to "grub for
grades" if they hope to enter graduate school.
The highly competitive, restrictive atmosphere of graduate school
admissions extends to much more than "grade-grubbing." There have
been reports of widespread cheating and sabotage among premedical
students in their dog-eat-dog competition.
Perhaps medical school admissions has evolved into a situation of
selecting the hard-core, do-anything-to-get-in students rather than
choosing the brightest, most well-rounded candidates.
We do not endorse the sacrifice of a liberal education for narrow
technical training. Yet the rising costs of education force students to
think twice about pre-professional training rather than "finding
themselves" after four years and over $20,000.
We suggest to President Lyman that he start here at Stanford to
make pre-professional curricula more humane. The schools of
medicine and law especially should relax their standards â€” not to
accept less intelligent and capable candidates, but to accept more
well-rounded ones. Students alone can not solve the problems of
ever-narrowing education.
