Editor:
As one of the neighbors of the
Children's Center and the Music
Annex I want to protest the scheduled
removal of these facilities to other
parts of the campus. In the time I have
spent at Stanford, I have found only
four things that are a constant spiritual
delight, and upon which I can reflect
when life seems more pointless than
usual. Those four things are: cattle
grazing on the hills near Foothill
Road, free canoes in Lake Lag in the
spring, the sound of some poor cellist
with the soul of Pablo Casals and the
fingers of a light-heavyweight slugging
it out in the Music Annex, and, best
and last, being awakened by the
sounds of kids paying at the Children's
Center.
Now, in one swoop, and a fell
swoop at that, some dark power
within the University is going to wipe
out two of the only four things that
distinguish this campus from North
Nowhere J.C., and I am afraid it is just
the beginning of the end. By 1976 we
will undoubtedly have an Arby's
franchise with a ten-acre parking lot
just off Foothill Road, with cows
plodding in the back door and
sandwiches plopping out the front.
Lake Lag will be drained and put to
use as a heliport, vital to the
maintenance of Stanford's position as
the hope of the largest corps of
non-teaching faculty in the western
world. And to house the increased
number of faculty that the heliport
will bring in, and at the same time to
give them an occasional glimpse of a
student, what better place to shelter
the emeriti and junior professors than
in a new housing project right in the
middle of the Row?
By God, if this doesn't have all the
earmarks of a master plan I don't
know what does. Everything is
accounted for except the canoes — but
even they might be used. We could
commission a talented and visionary
artist to create an aluminum statue of
a cow, a child, a cello and a canoe to
be placed on the grounds of the new
housing project, with an appropriate
inscription to explain what those
things are. I'm sure it would be lovely.

Recently there was a letter in the

Daily concerning Cowell emergency
service. Medical emergencies involving
Stanford students do occasionally
occur on campus, and it is well for the
community to be reminded how best
these can be handled.
In general, for what appears to be a
definite emergency, the resource to
call is the Rescue Squad of the
Stanford Fire Department (321-2300,
extension 2313, or dial "O" for
operator). Be as precise as possible as
to location, and nature of problem.
Many cases of illness or accident will
not be clear cut as to whether or not it
is a real emergency.
We suggest that the person helping
the patient call Cowell and talk to a
nurse or doctor and get some help as
to the severity of the problem, how it
should be handled, where the patient
should be taken if that is appropriate,
how they should be transported, etc.
Both resources can provide assistance.
If in doubt as to the severity, call the
Rescue Squad first as they can be at
the scene quickly with trained
resuscitation personnel and
equipment.
In some instances it is appropriate
for a doctor to go to the site; in many
cases it is better to bring the patient to
a facility where additional personnel,
equipment, edications, oxygen, etc.,
are available. For major medical
emergencies the patient should be
transported to the Stanford Hospital
Emergency Room, as that is the
regular emergency facility in this area.
The Rescue Squad and the Palo Alto
Ambulance Service are aware of these
capabilities.
In many cases it will be determined
that the illness or accident is of a
nature which can be handled at
Cowell. This sort of determination can
be made by the emergency personnel,
or residence staff and friends, at the
site in consultation with Cowell as
needed.
In the case of the student who
collapsed on the basketball court,
Cowell personnel decided, on the basis
of what they understood the situation
to be, the best thing was to have the
Rescue Squad sent and the patient
brought to Cowell or the hospital
emergency room as indicated by his
condition. In this case, because of the
severity of the problem, the patient
was taken to the hospital.

with the soul of Pablo Casals and the
fingers of a light-heavyweight slugging
it out in the Music Annex, and, best
and last, being awakened by the
sounds of kids paying at the Children's
Center.
Now, in one swoop, and a fell
swoop at that, some dark power
within the University is going to wipe
out two of the only four things that
distinguish this campus from North
Nowhere J.C., and I am afraid it is just
the beginning of the end. By 1976 we
will undoubtedly have an Arby's
franchise with a ten-acre parking lot
just off Foothill Road, with cows
plodding in the back door and
sandwiches plopping out the front.
Lake Lag will be drained and put to
use as a heliport, vital to the
maintenance of Stanford's position as
the hope of the largest corps of
non-teaching faculty in the western
world. And to house the increased
number of faculty that the heliport
will bring in, and at the same time to
give them an occasional glimpse of a
student, what better place to shelter
the emeriti and junior professors than
in a new housing project right in the
middle of the Row?
By God, if this doesn't have all the
earmarks of a master plan I don't
know what does. Everything is
accounted for except the canoes — but
even they might be used. We could
commission a talented and visionary
artist to create an aluminum statue of
a cow, a child, a cello and a canoe to
be placed on the grounds of the new
housing project, with an appropriate
inscription to explain what those
things are. I'm sure it would be lovely.

Recently there was a letter in the

Daily concerning Cowell emergency
service. Medical emergencies involving
Stanford students do occasionally
occur on campus, and it is well for the
community to be reminded how best
these can be handled.
In general, for what appears to be a
definite emergency, the resource to
call is the Rescue Squad of the
Stanford Fire Department (321-2300,
extension 2313, or dial "O" for
operator). Be as precise as possible as
to location, and nature of problem.
Many cases of illness or accident will
not be clear cut as to whether or not it
is a real emergency.
We suggest that the person helping
the patient call Cowell and talk to a
nurse or doctor and get some help as
to the severity of the problem, how it
should be handled, where the patient
should be taken if that is appropriate,
how they should be transported, etc.
Both resources can provide assistance.
If in doubt as to the severity, call the
Rescue Squad first as they can be at
the scene quickly with trained
resuscitation personnel and
equipment.
In some instances it is appropriate
for a doctor to go to the site; in many
cases it is better to bring the patient to
a facility where additional personnel,
equipment, edications, oxygen, etc.,
are available. For major medical
emergencies the patient should be
transported to the Stanford Hospital
Emergency Room, as that is the
regular emergency facility in this area.
The Rescue Squad and the Palo Alto
Ambulance Service are aware of these
capabilities.
In many cases it will be determined
that the illness or accident is of a
nature which can be handled at
Cowell. This sort of determination can
be made by the emergency personnel,
or residence staff and friends, at the
site in consultation with Cowell as
needed.
In the case of the student who
collapsed on the basketball court,
Cowell personnel decided, on the basis
of what they understood the situation
to be, the best thing was to have the
Rescue Squad sent and the patient
brought to Cowell or the hospital
emergency room as indicated by his
condition. In this case, because of the
severity of the problem, the patient
was taken to the hospital.

As one of the neighbors of the

removal of these facilities to other
parts of the campus. In the time I have
spent at Stanford, I have found only
four things that are a constant spiritual
delight, and upon which I can reflect
when life seems more pointless than
usual. Those four things are: cattle
grazing on the hills near Foothill

the beginning of the end. By 1976 we
will undoubtedly have an Arby's
franchise with a ten-acre parking lot
just off Foothill Road, with cows
plodding in the back door and
sandwiches plopping out the front.
Lake Lag will be drained and put to
use as a heliport, vital to the
maintenance of Stanford's position as
the hope of the largest corps of
non-teaching faculty in the western
world. And to house the increased
number of faculty that the heliport
will bring in, and at the same time to
give them an occasional glimpse of a
student, what better place to shelter
the emeriti and junior professors than
in a new housing project right in the
middle of the Row?
By God, if this doesn't have all the
earmarks of a master plan I don't
know what does. Everything is
accounted for except the canoes — but
even they might be used. We could
commission a talented and visionary
artist to create an aluminum statue of
a cow, a child, a cello and a canoe to
be placed on the grounds of the new
housing project, with an appropriate
inscription to explain what those
things are. I'm sure it would be lovely.

Emergency Procedure
Editor:
Recently there was a letter in the

Daily concerning Cowell emergency
service. Medical emergencies involving
Stanford students do occasionally
occur on campus, and it is well for the
community to be reminded how best
these can be handled.
In general, for what appears to be a
definite emergency, the resource to
call is the Rescue Squad of the
Stanford Fire Department (321-2300,
extension 2313, or dial "O" for
operator). Be as precise as possible as
to location, and nature of problem.
Many cases of illness or accident will
not be clear cut as to whether or not it
is a real emergency.
We suggest that the person helping
the patient call Cowell and talk to a
nurse or doctor and get some help as
to the severity of the problem, how it
should be handled, where the patient
should be taken if that is appropriate,
how they should be transported, etc.
Both resources can provide assistance.
If in doubt as to the severity, call the
Rescue Squad first as they can be at
the scene quickly with trained
resuscitation personnel and
equipment.
In some instances it is appropriate
for a doctor to go to the site; in many
cases it is better to bring the patient to
a facility where additional personnel,
equipment, edications, oxygen, etc.,
are available. For major medical
emergencies the patient should be
transported to the Stanford Hospital
Emergency Room, as that is the
regular emergency facility in this area.
The Rescue Squad and the Palo Alto
Ambulance Service are aware of these
capabilities.
In many cases it will be determined
that the illness or accident is of a
nature which can be handled at
Cowell. This sort of determination can
be made by the emergency personnel,
or residence staff and friends, at the
site in consultation with Cowell as
needed.
In the case of the student who
collapsed on the basketball court,
Cowell personnel decided, on the basis
of what they understood the situation
to be, the best thing was to have the
Rescue Squad sent and the patient
brought to Cowell or the hospital
emergency room as indicated by his
condition. In this case, because of the
severity of the problem, the patient
was taken to the hospital.
