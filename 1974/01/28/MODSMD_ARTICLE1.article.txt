# Terrace Traffic Spurs Controversy
## 
### BILL ROSS 
College Terrace residents have
mixed reactions about attempts by
Palo Alto to reduce traffic in the area.
Some support the proposals of the
College Terrace Residents' Association
to close certain accesses to the region,
while others, doubting whether any
problem exists, see no need for any
barriers.
The controversy will be discussed
Wednesday evening at a meeting of the
residents' association.
In September, barriers were erected
at the intersections of Stanford
Avenue and Yale, Bowdoin and
Columbia Avenues, but residents
generally agree that they are
inconvenient and have failed to reduce
traffic in the area.
Heavy Traffic Burden
California Avenue, forming one of
the borders of College Terrace,
currently has a daily traffic burden
three times heavier than it was meant
to have, according to James
Culpepper, president of the Residents'
Association.
As a "neighborhood access street"
— one onto which the driveways of
private homes open — it should have
no more than 2000 cars per day.
Traffic studies show that 6000 cars use

the street each day, Culpepper said.
The barriers set up in September
have not been effective, Culpepper
declared. "The plan isn't stringent
enough. A lot of people drive around
the barriers," he said. On Hanover
Street, the daily number of cars has
increased from 1900 to 2500. Hanover
is a residential street and should have
no more than 500 cars using it.
Proposals Proliferate
In an effort to remedy the problem,
the Residents' Association presented a
proposal, Plan A, to the Palo Alto City
Council last year. The plan called for
barriers at the intersections of
California and Hanover, and Amherst
and Stanford, with a diagonal barrier
at Bowdoin and Stanford. Early this
month, the Policy and Procedures
Committee of the city recommended
the plan be adopted, but the council
recently decided to postpone a
decision until after the Wednesday
discussion at the Residents' Center.
Meanwhile, several other plans have
been suggested, and the Residents'
Association has proposed a new plan,
Plan D. The new proposal is the same
as Plan A, except that it would include
a "Y" shaped barrier at the
intersection of Stanford and Bowdoin
rather than the diagonal blockade.

College Terrace, comprised of a
cross-section of Stanford employees,
students and people who work in Palo
Alto, is not solidly behind the plan of
the Residents' Association.
Plan A Called Punitive
"I feel strongly that Plan A [no
direct access to Stanford) ...would
cause hardships to College Terrace
residents," stated Dianne Kanerva, a
College Terrace resident, in a letter to
the City Council.

While conceding that the heavy
traffic in the region is a nuisance,
Kanerva added, "Plan A is extreme
and almost punitive to Stanford
employees and students. It is unfair
and above all, unreasonable, to have to
double one's driving distance, mingle
in heavy rush-hour traffic, and add to
that traffic on El Camino and Junipero
Serra in order to get to work when
roads already exist that can share the

NO WHERE TO TURN — Although these signs are very specific, some drivers are deliberately disobeying them. It's all part
of a controversy stemming from the erection of barriers on Stanford Ave., designed to cut down on traffic near College
Terrace.
