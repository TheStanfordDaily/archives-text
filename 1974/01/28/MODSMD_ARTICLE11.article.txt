# Don't Deny Voter Mandate
## Nixon's Policies: No Basis To Impeach 
### 
The Daily editorial of Jan. 22, serves only to
provide more evidence to those of us who believe
that the liberal elitists in this country are "out to
get Nixon" rather than get to the "Bottom of the
corruption within the government as a whole. The
call for resignation or impeachment is no longer
based solely on impeachable offenses but rather on
policy disagreements that the editorial board has
with President Nixon.
The American public should realize that any
group demanding resignation or impeachment on
the basis of political disagreements, is attempting
only to deny the wishes of the 1972 voters. For the
as yet innocent President to resign under fire would
set an ugly precedent that may be used again when a
Congress and Press oppose a popularly elected
president.
One year ago, when calls for impeachment were
first being heard, the reasoning favoring such action
was sound: possible involvement in the Watergate
affair, possible misuse of funds in improvements to
President Nixon's homes and possible instances of
presidential knowledge of illegal bombings.
Since that time, the President has undergone
more intensive investigation by more people than
almost any man in American political or criminal
history. Of the 35 key witnesses paraded before the
Ervin committee last summer, not one could tie the
President to prior knowledge of the Watergate break
in and only an indicted John Dean could interpret
the President's actions as suggesting knowledge of a
cover up.
One year after the Watergate affair broke wide
open and nearly two years since the break in itself,
President Nixon does not appear close to any
indictments and there is no reason to believe that
the House will ever call the Senate to jury on the
case. The American people by a sound 53 percent to
37 percent in the latest Gallup poll are against
impeachment.
The frustrations of the liberals and the press has
caused them to look elsewhere for substantiations
to their continued cries for resignation and
impeachment. The Daily has found the President's
policies to be enough substantiation. I find it a
direct insult to my intelligence when a group of

apparently biased journalists ask for the President's
resignation or impeachment based on
unemployment, price rises and inadequate health
care.
I believe in that magnificent guarantee given to
all Americans by our forefathers that all men are
innocent until proven guilty. Therefore I am not
prepared to fully debate a position on the
President's innocence or guilt in Watergate related
matters! One should wait until all the evidence is in
before speaking out on that particular subject.
However at this time his continued innocence must
speak for itself.
The Daily, though, calls for resignation of what
may be an innocent man. As for impeaching a
president on policy matters, at least all the evidence
is available and should be brought to the public's
attention. To put the results of Nixon's policies and
leadership into perspective first let us look at the
shape this country was in five years ago.
When President Nixon took office in 1968, the
16,000 military advisers that President Kennedy had
sent to Vietnam, had mushroomed to a fighting
force of 575,000 men. By November of 1968, 300
brave young men a week were returning home from
the war in caskets.
We can remember the mishandling of the Bay of
Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis that left a
Communist government 90 miles from our borders.
Vivid scenes of smoke billowing above our cities
are recalled as race riots led to looting and the
deaths of hundreds.
Most major American universities were shut
down at one time or another by student violence.
Energetic leaders were assassinated in their
prime: Martin Luther King, John Kennedy, Malcolm
X, George Lincoln Rockwell and Bobby Kennedy.
Bombs exploded in the night and policemen died
daily at the hands of snipers.
The last months of the Johnson Administration
saw the beginning of the inevitable result of the
economic policies of the previous eight years:
recession.
What are the nations problems that warrant
impeachment according to the Daily?
Is it that American boys are not engaged in

Bob Ottilie

combat anywhere on the globe for the first time in
years? Is it that the draft has ended or that 18 year
olds can now vote? Maybe the Daily is upset that
college students and blacks are now spending their
time getting excellent educations while pursuing
constructive goals through proper channels.
The serious crime rate which increased 17
percent in President Johnson's last year in office
actually dropped in 1972 by 2.3 percent. This
decline in the crime rate was the first in 17 years.
Unemployment dropped to a 4.5 percent low last
October, the lowest peace time rate in over a
decade. Last year not one plane was skyjacked.
While the Daily has us on the verge of economic
recession we can comfort ourselves somewhat by
remembering that the average American's yearly
income, after inflation, is still up 40 percent in the
last decade U.S. News and World
Report.
Last week, Henry Kissinger, acting on behalf of
the President, gained an accord that represents a
substantial step towards a lasting peace in the
Mid-East. And then there is detente with China and
the Soviet Union.
If the Daily and the nation's political left want to
impeach on policy, let them, for I and millions of
other Americans will stand up and fight them, and
we'll win. They have conspired to drag "Watergate"
on for four years and thus bring the Nixon policies
to a standstill. What this means to the American
public is a denial of their choice that this grand
country should follow the same course in Nixon's
second term as in his first.
It is time for a case that has been drawn out for
two years to be closed. Whether Nixon is guilty or
innocent should be decided immediately on terms
of impeachable offenses, not on policy
disagreement. And then let this country move in the
fashion that carried it from 1968-1972. The
Democrats and liberal press have successfully denied
a mandate of Nixon's policies and it is high time the
public realized it has been taken.

President's innocence or guilt in Watergate related
matters! One should wait until all the evidence is in
before speaking out on that particular subject.
However at this time his continued innocence must
speak for itself.
The Daily, though, calls for resignation of what
may be an innocent man. As for impeaching a
president on policy matters, at least all the evidence
is available and should be brought to the public's
attention. To put the results of Nixon's policies and
leadership into perspective first let us look at the
shape this country was in five years ago.
When President Nixon took office in 1968, the
16,000 military advisers that President Kennedy had
sent to Vietnam, had mushroomed to a fighting
force of 575,000 men. By November of 1968, 300
brave young men a week were returning home from
the war in caskets.
We can remember the mishandling of the Bay of
Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis that left a
Communist government 90 miles from our borders.
Vivid scenes of smoke billowing above our cities
are recalled as race riots led to looting and the
deaths of hundreds.
Most major American universities were shut
down at one time or another by student violence.
Energetic leaders were assassinated in their
prime: Martin Luther King, John Kennedy, Malcolm
X, George Lincoln Rockwell and Bobby Kennedy.
Bombs exploded in the night and policemen died
daily at the hands of snipers.
The last months of the Johnson Administration
saw the beginning of the inevitable result of the
economic policies of the previous eight years:
recession.
What are the nations problems that warrant
impeachment according to the Daily?
Is it that American boys are not engaged in

Bob Ottilie

combat anywhere on the globe for the first time in
years? Is it that the draft has ended or that 18 year
olds can now vote? Maybe the Daily is upset that
college students and blacks are now spending their
time getting excellent educations while pursuing
constructive goals through proper channels.
The serious crime rate which increased 17
percent in President Johnson's last year in office
actually dropped in 1972 by 2.3 percent. This
decline in the crime rate was the first in 17 years.
Unemployment dropped to a 4.5 percent low last
October, the lowest peace time rate in over a
decade. Last year not one plane was skyjacked.
While the Daily has us on the verge of economic
recession we can comfort ourselves somewhat by
remembering that the average American's yearly
income, after inflation, is still up 40 percent in the
last decade U.S. News and World
Report.
Last week, Henry Kissinger, acting on behalf of
the President, gained an accord that represents a
substantial step towards a lasting peace in the
Mid-East. And then there is detente with China and
the Soviet Union.
If the Daily and the nation's political left want to
impeach on policy, let them, for I and millions of
other Americans will stand up and fight them, and
we'll win. They have conspired to drag "Watergate"
on for four years and thus bring the Nixon policies
to a standstill. What this means to the American
public is a denial of their choice that this grand
country should follow the same course in Nixon's
second term as in his first.
It is time for a case that has been drawn out for
two years to be closed. Whether Nixon is guilty or
innocent should be decided immediately on terms
of impeachable offenses, not on policy
disagreement. And then let this country move in the
fashion that carried it from 1968-1972. The
Democrats and liberal press have successfully denied
a mandate of Nixon's policies and it is high time the
public realized it has been taken.
(Bob Ottilie is a freshman.)
The Daily editorial of Jan. 22, serves only to
provide more evidence to those of us who believe
that the liberal elitists in this country are "out to
get Nixon" rather than get to the "Bottom of the
corruption within the government as a whole. The
call for resignation or impeachment is no longer
based solely on impeachable offenses but rather on
policy disagreements that the editorial board has
with President Nixon.
The American public should realize that any
group demanding resignation or impeachment on
the basis of political disagreements, is attempting
only to deny the wishes of the 1972 voters. For the
as yet innocent President to resign under fire would
set an ugly precedent that may be used again when a
Congress and Press oppose a popularly elected
president.
One year ago, when calls for impeachment were
first being heard, the reasoning favoring such action
was sound: possible involvement in the Watergate
affair, possible misuse of funds in improvements to
President Nixon's homes and possible instances of
presidential knowledge of illegal bombings.
Since that time, the President has undergone
more intensive investigation by more people than
almost any man in American political or criminal
history. Of the 35 key witnesses paraded before the
Ervin committee last summer, not one could tie the
President to prior knowledge of the Watergate break
in and only an indicted John Dean could interpret
the President's actions as suggesting knowledge of a
cover up.
One year after the Watergate affair broke wide
open and nearly two years since the break in itself,
President Nixon does not appear close to any
indictments and there is no reason to believe that
the House will ever call the Senate to jury on the
case. The American people by a sound 53 percent to
37 percent in the latest Gallup poll are against
impeachment.
The frustrations of the liberals and the press has
caused them to look elsewhere for substantiations
to their continued cries for resignation and
impeachment. The Daily has found the President's
policies to be enough substantiation. I find it a
direct insult to my intelligence when a group of

apparently biased journalists ask for the President's
resignation or impeachment based on
unemployment, price rises and inadequate health
care.
I believe in that magnificent guarantee given to
all Americans by our forefathers that all men are
innocent until proven guilty. Therefore I am not
prepared to fully debate a position on the
President's innocence or guilt in Watergate related
matters! One should wait until all the evidence is in

October, the lowest peace time rate in over a
decade. Last year not one plane was skyjacked.
While the Daily has us on the verge of economic
recession we can comfort ourselves somewhat by
remembering that the average American's yearly
income, after inflation, is still up 40 percent in the
last decade U.S. News and World
Report.
Last week, Henry Kissinger, acting on behalf of
the President, gained an accord that represents a
substantial step towards a lasting peace in the
Mid-East. And then there is detente with China and
the Soviet Union.
If the Daily and the nation's political left want to
impeach on policy, let them, for I and millions of
other Americans will stand up and fight them, and
we'll win. They have conspired to drag "Watergate"
on for four years and thus bring the Nixon policies
to a standstill. What this means to the American
public is a denial of their choice that this grand
country should follow the same course in Nixon's
second term as in his first.
It is time for a case that has been drawn out for
two years to be closed. Whether Nixon is guilty or
innocent should be decided immediately on terms
of impeachable offenses, not on policy
disagreement. And then let this country move in the
fashion that carried it from 1968-1972. The
Democrats and liberal press have successfully denied
a mandate of Nixon's policies and it is high time the
public realized it has been taken.

The Daily editorial of Jan. 22, serves only to
provide more evidence to those of us who believe
that the liberal elitists in this country are "out to
get Nixon" rather than get to the "Bottom of the
corruption within the government as a whole. The
call for resignation or impeachment is no longer
based solely on impeachable offenses but rather on
policy disagreements that the editorial board has
with President Nixon.
The American public should realize that any
group demanding resignation or impeachment on
the basis of political disagreements, is attempting
only to deny the wishes of the 1972 voters. For the
as yet innocent President to resign under fire would
set an ugly precedent that may be used again when a
Congress and Press oppose a popularly elected
president.
One year ago, when calls for impeachment were
first being heard, the reasoning favoring such action
was sound: possible involvement in the Watergate
affair, possible misuse of funds in improvements to
President Nixon's homes and possible instances of
presidential knowledge of illegal bombings.
Since that time, the President has undergone
more intensive investigation by more people than
almost any man in American political or criminal
history. Of the 35 key witnesses paraded before the
Ervin committee last summer, not one could tie the
President to prior knowledge of the Watergate break
in and only an indicted John Dean could interpret
the President's actions as suggesting knowledge of a
cover up.
One year after the Watergate affair broke wide
open and nearly two years since the break in itself,
President Nixon does not appear close to any
indictments and there is no reason to believe that
the House will ever call the Senate to jury on the
case. The American people by a sound 53 percent to
37 percent in the latest Gallup poll are against
impeachment.
The frustrations of the liberals and the press has
caused them to look elsewhere for substantiations
to their continued cries for resignation and
impeachment. The Daily has found the President's
policies to be enough substantiation. I find it a
direct insult to my intelligence when a group of

apparently biased journalists ask for the President's
resignation or impeachment based on
unemployment, price rises and inadequate health
care.
I believe in that magnificent guarantee given to
all Americans by our forefathers that all men are
innocent until proven guilty. Therefore I am not
prepared to fully debate a position on the
President's innocence or guilt in Watergate related
matters! One should wait until all the evidence is in
before speaking out on that particular subject.
However at this time his continued innocence must
speak for itself.
The Daily, though, calls for resignation of what
may be an innocent man. As for impeaching a
president on policy matters, at least all the evidence
is available and should be brought to the public's
attention. To put the results of Nixon's policies and
leadership into perspective first let us look at the
shape this country was in five years ago.
When President Nixon took office in 1968, the
16,000 military advisers that President Kennedy had
sent to Vietnam, had mushroomed to a fighting
force of 575,000 men. By November of 1968, 300
brave young men a week were returning home from
the war in caskets.
We can remember the mishandling of the Bay of
Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis that left a
Communist government 90 miles from our borders.
Vivid scenes of smoke billowing above our cities
are recalled as race riots led to looting and the
deaths of hundreds.
Most major American universities were shut
down at one time or another by student violence.
Energetic leaders were assassinated in their
prime: Martin Luther King, John Kennedy, Malcolm
X, George Lincoln Rockwell and Bobby Kennedy.
Bombs exploded in the night and policemen died
daily at the hands of snipers.
The last months of the Johnson Administration
saw the beginning of the inevitable result of the
economic policies of the previous eight years:
recession.
What are the nations problems that warrant
impeachment according to the Daily?
Is it that American boys are not engaged in

Bob Ottilie

combat anywhere on the globe for the first time in
years? Is it that the draft has ended or that 18 year
olds can now vote? Maybe the Daily is upset that
college students and blacks are now spending their
time getting excellent educations while pursuing
constructive goals through proper channels.
The serious crime rate which increased 17
percent in President Johnson's last year in office
actually dropped in 1972 by 2.3 percent. This
decline in the crime rate was the first in 17 years.
Unemployment dropped to a 4.5 percent low last
October, the lowest peace time rate in over a
decade. Last year not one plane was skyjacked.
