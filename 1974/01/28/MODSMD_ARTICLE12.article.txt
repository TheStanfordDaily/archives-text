# Scholarships, Diversity And Individual Rights
## ROTC Advantages Outweigh Dangers 
### 
Recently ROTC installment was
again met with another flourish of
picket signs. There are a few things
that we should think about before
ROTC is kept ousted for another year.
Often times I found individuals
ignoring the advantages of such a
program.
Stanford contains within its student
body a dynamic mixture of students
ranging from hillside palace residents
to impoverished inner-city dwellers.
Stanford is expensive. The rising costs
in attending Stanford are met by
different students in different ways.
There are those that write a check
drawing on a parent contributed
balance and there are those that are in
enough financial need to qualify for
substantial aid grants or scholarships.
But what about the vast number of
students who are too poor for
sufficient parental contributions, yet
too rich for aid based on need? These
students are probably more in
financial deficit than anyone; many
have dropped attending Stanford
altogether. The ROTC program
provides a constructive alternative
other than incurring debt or dropping
enrollment. This alternative is the
ROTC scholarships available under the
program. By denying ROTC we are
denying more; many students rely on
such scholarships.
In addition to scholarships, ROTC
supplies a great asset to the academic
diversity. In former years, for instance,
celestrial navigation was a popular
course enjoyed by many (ROTC
courses were not restricted to students

in the program). Today Stanford's
diversity is not what it once was and
what it can be; today we have no
ROTC at Stanford University.
Scholarships Lost
Thus without such a program, we
lose scholarships for those that need
them, and consequently lose some of
the income group people that help
make Stanford people the healthy
diversity of people that it is. We lose
academic diversity as well.
The various criticisms of ROTC
seem unwarranted in the final analysis.
Many are against ROTC because it
possibly enhances the number of
deaths at time of war. It seems that in
Vietnam, a tragically recent example
(from which I would hope we have not
forgotten the lessons), many people on
both sides died from poor American
training and leadership. Intelligent
leadership was clearly lacking in the
My Lai Massacre for instance.
It seems to me that increased
intelligence in leadership would not
result in blind Napalming of square
miles of land at a time. In the event of
war I would much rather see our
forces led intelligently rather than led
merely with the brutalizing death
technology machines. The inequities
of the present blood-baths of warfare
could be perhaps reduced with less
emphasis on creating the ultimate
death instruments, and more emphasis
on intelligent, humane, thinking
leadership. Restricting ROTC from
Stanford University is perhaps more
harmful toward this end.
Others argue, "But why do we need

ROTC for academic diversity? You
can't learn to speak Swedish at
Stanford either." This is true but if
someone wanted to pay for the
program and if students were willing
to take courses under it, I don't see
anything to impede establishing such a
department. Such is the case with
ROTC. It enhances diversity of
curriculum but not to the monetary
expense of the university nor the
students.
There is however one somewhat
valid reason for keeping ROTC off
campus. This is the philosophic reason.

William Knoke

ROTC is a symbol that stands for, in
many minds, more than ROTC. It
stands for imperialistic aggression, war,
expansion, hostilities, militarism,
blockades, and the like. Truly, ROTC
is symbolic of many things. But I
would hope that the significance of
this symbol does not outweigh the
advantages of scholarship potential,
academic diversity, and the rights of
individuals that so wish to enter the
military and constructively change it
for the better.
