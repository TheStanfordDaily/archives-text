# 'Adversary Relationship' Aids Public
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Communication Prof. William
L. Rivers described the
relationship between the press and
politicians as "a mixture of tact
and antagonism, cooperation and
conflict" Friday at the Palo Alto
Main Library.
Rivers addressed an audience
of 70 on what he calls the
"adversary relationship." Rivers
believes that the relationship
"exists for our |the public's]
benefit."
In describing an incident while
working for The Reporter
magazine, Rivers referred to one
of his own journalistic blunders,
saying, "I had allowed my biases
quite unconsciously to effect my
reporting.
"I suggest that this is a fairly
common fault not only among
reporters but in you and me. We
tend to forget that with which we
don't agree."
Unconscious Bias
Rivers said that most biases, on
the part of both the press and
politicians, are unconscious.
Referring to the way Presidents
have manipulated the press, Rivers
said, "For the most part, I think
they [the Presidents] have
sincerely believed in their policies
and programs."

Rivers stated that President
Kennedy was most successful with
the press largely because Kennedy
had been a reporter and"he
genuinely liked the press."
President Johnson, according to
Rivers, was "able through
personal force to maintain a good
press relationship."
Press Ignored
President Nixon, said Rivers,
"did not submit himself to press
conference questions," but
instead went "over their [the
press'| heads to the people" by
direct broadcast of prepared
speeches on network television
and radio.
Unlike Johnson, who held an
average of one press conference
every two weeks, Nixon has
sometimes waited as long as five
months.
In responding to an audience
question about the Watergate
cover-up. Rivers declared:
"Let us assume for a moment
that Mr. Nixon did not know. If
he had held regular press
conferences every two weeks, he
could not have escaped knowing."
Because Nixon would have had to
know what was happening in his
office to face the press, Rivers
believes, he would have discovered
the cover-up.
