# Cal Golfers End Stanford Streak
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
California ended a 23-yeai* Stanford golf winning streak Friday, but
like Notre Dame's basketball team, the Bears may have to suffer the
consequences in next week's rematch.
Cal upset the Cards 14V6-13V6 Friday at Franklin Canyon Country
Club for the Bears' first victory over Stanford since 1951. Cardinal
coach Bud Finger, however, remained convinced of Stanford's
superiority.
"It had been 23 years since they beat us," Finger said, "and it will
be another 33 years until they beat us again."
California will be one of six entrants this Friday when the Cards
host an 18-hole tournament on the Stanford course. "If anyone wants
to put any money on who has the better score Friday | between
Stanford and Cal), just let me know," Finger said.

Last Friday's match wasn't
really a fluke, just the result of a
significant home course
advantage. Only three Stanford
players had ever seen the tricky
Franklin Canyon course, and no
one had played it more than once.
Still, Stanford managed to
dominate the first two groups,
losing the match only because
freshman Glenn Goethels and
sophomore Tom Mason dropped
six points in the final foursome.
Goethels and Mason were
competing in their first collegiate
match.
"I probably shouldn't have
played Glenn and Tom in the
same group," Finger said. "It's no
more than a second guess, but
maybe I should have moved one
of the other players down to the
fifth position."
Stanford won 12 of 18 points
in the first two groups as Aly
Trompas and George Pettinger
defeated their opponents with
73's. Dave Baskins tied his
opponent (both shot 75) and
Conrad Nifmeier three-putted the
18th green to drop a
heartbreaking 73-74 decision.
Goethels shot 78 and Mason 83
In the final group.
In an equally exciting freshman
match, Stanford's Brent Murray
eagled the last hole as the Cards
closed a seemingly
insurmountable Cal lead to earn a
13'/2-13V& tie. Murray and David
Haugh were low for Stanford with
77's.
