# Local Group Seeks Equity In Rape Cases

### WENDY QUINONES 
"The whole court procedure is
really rigged against the rape victim,"
says Jackie Reynolds, director of the
Rape Crisis Education Program at the
Mid-Peninsula YWCA in Palo Alto.
Unlike victims of crimes like
robbery, a rape victim trying to
prosecute her assailant must prove in
court that she did not consent to the
crime. "It's almost as though she is the
guilty perspn," says Reynolds.
The same kinds of attitudes pervade
hospital and police procedures,
according to Reynolds. Her program at
the YWCA, in conjunction with a
Stanford group, Women Against Rape,
last year began studying the treatment
of rape victims in Palo Alto, Mountain
View and Los Altos.
Reynolds will be one of the
participants in tonight's Women's
Center Activities Night at 8 p.m. in the
second floor Clubhouse lounge. She
and representatives of other ongoing
women's groups will be discussing
their past activities and future plans.
Reynolds says her activities have
shown results. Previously, for example,
she says local hospital policies
frequently prevented a victim from
prosecuting her attacker. "They'd
treat her medically," she says, "but
they wouldn't record her as a rape case
and they wouldn't give medical
evidence in court." But pressure from
the Rape Crisis Center and Women
Against Rape has started to change
these policies.
Palo Alto police procedures and
attitudes have also changed over the
last year, Reynolds says. Women
Against Rape gave a seminar last year
for Palo Alto police cadets, and there
is now a woman officer available 24
hours a day to handle rape cases.
According to Dana Weigent, who
taught a SWOPSI course last year on
"Rape at Stanford," the problem of
rape on campus does not seem to be
acute. Figures from 1973 show 11
reported "sex crimes": one attempted
rape and 10 indecent exposures. But
police figures may not tell the whole

story, says Weigent, because few rapes
are actually reported — the FBI
estimates that on average, only 10
percent are reported to police.
Reynolds hopes to set up a system
of "advocates" this year to help rape
victims with legal, medical and
psychological problems. Such a system
is now in operation at the San Jose
YWCA for southern Santa Clara
County.
According to Reynolds, rape
victims typically call a crisis center a
week or so after they were attacked,
and are often depressed and unsure of
their legal rights. This, she says, is
when a system of advocates is most
helpful. Her program at the YWCA
will provide would-be advocates with
training in legal counseling,
psychological referrals and local
hospital procedures.

psychological referrals and local
hospital procedures.
"The whole court procedure is
really rigged against the rape victim,"
says Jackie Reynolds, director of the
Rape Crisis Education Program at the
Mid-Peninsula YWCA in Palo Alto.
Unlike victims of crimes like
robbery, a rape victim trying to
prosecute her assailant must prove in
court that she did not consent to the
crime. "It's almost as though she is the
guilty perspn," says Reynolds.
The same kinds of attitudes pervade
hospital and police procedures,
according to Reynolds. Her program at
the YWCA, in conjunction with a
Stanford group, Women Against Rape,
last year began studying the treatment
of rape victims in Palo Alto, Mountain
View and Los Altos.
Reynolds will be one of the
participants in tonight's Women's
Center Activities Night at 8 p.m. in the
second floor Clubhouse lounge. She
and representatives of other ongoing
women's groups will be discussing
their past activities and future plans.
Reynolds says her activities have
shown results. Previously, for example,
she says local hospital policies
frequently prevented a victim from
prosecuting her attacker. "They'd
treat her medically," she says, "but
they wouldn't record her as a rape case
and they wouldn't give medical
evidence in court." But pressure from
the Rape Crisis Center and Women
Against Rape has started to change
these policies.
Palo Alto police procedures and
attitudes have also changed over the
last year, Reynolds says. Women
Against Rape gave a seminar last year
for Palo Alto police cadets, and there
is now a woman officer available 24
hours a day to handle rape cases.
According to Dana Weigent, who
taught a SWOPSI course last year on
"Rape at Stanford," the problem of
rape on campus does not seem to be
acute. Figures from 1973 show 11
reported "sex crimes": one attempted
rape and 10 indecent exposures. But
police figures may not tell the whole

story, says Weigent, because few rapes
are actually reported — the FBI
estimates that on average, only 10
percent are reported to police.
Reynolds hopes to set up a system
of "advocates" this year to help rape
victims with legal, medical and
psychological problems. Such a system
is now in operation at the San Jose
YWCA for southern Santa Clara
County.
According to Reynolds, rape
victims typically call a crisis center a
week or so after they were attacked,
and are often depressed and unsure of
their legal rights. This, she says, is
when a system of advocates is most
helpful. Her program at the YWCA
will provide would-be advocates with
training in legal counseling,
psychological referrals and local
hospital procedures.
