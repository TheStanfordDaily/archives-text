# Hug Captures All-Around, But Gymnasts Lose
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Despite excellent performances by Steve Hug, the Stanford
gymnastics team fell to Pac-8 rivals California and Oregon in the
season opener this weekend.
Friday evening at Berkeley, the host school won the compulsories
with 148.9 score. Oregon was second at 146.7 and Stanford third with
142.85. Cal State-Northridge, which didn't participate in the optionals
the following night, was fourth at 137.1.
Cal was again the victor at Maples Pavilion Saturday in the
optionals competition, this time with an impressive 159.95. Oregon
was a close second at 158.95, and the Cards trailed with 156.95.
Hug was the individual standout in both competitions, taking the
all-around title in both the optionals and compulsories as well as
winning several individual events. "I was very pleased with his
performance," said Coach Sadao Hamada. "Steve came back from
Japan with a lot of improvement."
In taking the all-around Friday, Hug amassed a total of 54.15 for
the six events, more than four points ahead of runnerup Clark
Johnson's 50.1 for Cal. His score included 9.35 sidehorse and highbar
routines and a 9.25 on the parallel bars.
Hug's Scores
In Saturday's optionals, Hug's total was 55.2. Highlighting his
performance with a 9.5 parallel bars routine, he fell below 9.0 only
once, with an 8.9 in floor exercise. His other scores were: sidehorse,
9.25; rings, 9.3; vaulting, 9.0; and highbar, 9.25.
Sidehorse specialist Ted Marcy proved he is still master of that
event as he twisted and spun his way to victory in both the
compulsories and the optionals. The defending Pac-8 champion began
his second season with the Cards with a 9.6 routine at Berkeley, the
highest score of any event in the competition. His 9.5 the following
evening was only slightly less impressive.
Howard Bessen was Stanford's other individual winner, scoring an
excellent 9.4 to take the rings event Saturday. The previous evening
he had tied Cal's Mark Lundy at 9.1 in the compulsories. The only
other Cardinal to break 9.0 was Bob Anderson, who hit a 9.2 highbar
routine in the optionals.
Although Cal and Oregon outscored the Cards more on depth than
anything else, they had some fine individual performances as well.
Lundy's 9.1 rings score and Mark Adams' 9.05 sidehorse routine were
Cal's only standouts in the compulsories. For Oregon, Joe Percival's
9.25 sidehorse and Bob Rikli's 9.0 floor exercise were the high marks
Friday night.
Success In Optionals
Both Cal and Oregon scored higher in the optionals. Lundy led the
Bears in the rings again with a 9.3, and Clark Johnson hit a 9.15
parallel bars routine. Oregon concentrated their points in floor
exercise, where Rikli scored 9.35 and Don Lester 9.2, and the high
bar, where Mark Stone's 9.25 was supported by Randy Lary's 9.1 and
Steve Raskam's 9.0.
Taking the competition as a whole, the Cards would have been in
good shape if the last two events had been eliminated. Both nights,
Stanford held the lead going into the parallel bars. "We just don't have
enough depth in those events," said Hamada, speaking of the parallel
bars and high bar. "If I had one or two more guys there we'd be in
good shape."
Overall, though, the coach was satisfied with the performances.
"Some of the parts are still pretty rough but I know where we need to
work now. I think we'll be ready by the Pac-8."
The gymnasts will spend this week in preparation for a contest
with Arizona Saturday at Maples. "We've never gone against Arizona,
so we don't know much about them," Hamada commented. "We're
expecting them to be a little sloppy on form, but with some
spectacular moves."
The Cards' highbar score could be bolstered by the return of Bob
Horwitz, who did not have a routine prepared for this past weekend's
competition.

evening was only slightly less impressive.
Howard Bessen was Stanford's other individual winner, scoring an
excellent 9.4 to take the rings event Saturday. The previous evening
he had tied Cal's Mark Lundy at 9.1 in the compulsories. The only
other Cardinal to break 9.0 was Bob Anderson, who hit a 9.2 highbar
routine in the optionals.
Although Cal and Oregon outscored the Cards more on depth than
anything else, they had some fine individual performances as well.
Lundy's 9.1 rings score and Mark Adams' 9.05 sidehorse routine were
Cal's only standouts in the compulsories. For Oregon, Joe Percival's
9.25 sidehorse and Bob Rikli's 9.0 floor exercise were the high marks
Friday night.
Success In Optionals
Both Cal and Oregon scored higher in the optionals. Lundy led the
Bears in the rings again with a 9.3, and Clark Johnson hit a 9.15
parallel bars routine. Oregon concentrated their points in floor
exercise, where Rikli scored 9.35 and Don Lester 9.2, and the high
bar, where Mark Stone's 9.25 was supported by Randy Lary's 9.1 and
Steve Raskam's 9.0.
Taking the competition as a whole, the Cards would have been in
good shape if the last two events had been eliminated. Both nights,
Stanford held the lead going into the parallel bars. "We just don't have
enough depth in those events," said Hamada, speaking of the parallel
bars and high bar. "If I had one or two more guys there we'd be in
good shape."
Overall, though, the coach was satisfied with the performances.
"Some of the parts are still pretty rough but I know where we need to
work now. I think we'll be ready by the Pac-8."
The gymnasts will spend this week in preparation for a contest
with Arizona Saturday at Maples. "We've never gone against Arizona,
so we don't know much about them," Hamada commented. "We're
expecting them to be a little sloppy on form, but with some
spectacular moves."
The Cards' highbar score could be bolstered by the return of Bob
Horwitz, who did not have a routine prepared for this past weekend's
competition.
Despite excellent performances by Steve Hug, the Stanford
gymnastics team fell to Pac-8 rivals California and Oregon in the
season opener this weekend.
Friday evening at Berkeley, the host school won the compulsories
with 148.9 score. Oregon was second at 146.7 and Stanford third with
142.85. Cal State-Northridge, which didn't participate in the optionals
the following night, was fourth at 137.1.
Cal was again the victor at Maples Pavilion Saturday in the
optionals competition, this time with an impressive 159.95. Oregon
was a close second at 158.95, and the Cards trailed with 156.95.
Hug was the individual standout in both competitions, taking the
all-around title in both the optionals and compulsories as well as
winning several individual events. "I was very pleased with his
performance," said Coach Sadao Hamada. "Steve came back from
Japan with a lot of improvement."
In taking the all-around Friday, Hug amassed a total of 54.15 for
the six events, more than four points ahead of runnerup Clark
Johnson's 50.1 for Cal. His score included 9.35 sidehorse and highbar
routines and a 9.25 on the parallel bars.
Hug's Scores
In Saturday's optionals, Hug's total was 55.2. Highlighting his
performance with a 9.5 parallel bars routine, he fell below 9.0 only
once, with an 8.9 in floor exercise. His other scores were: sidehorse,
9.25; rings, 9.3; vaulting, 9.0; and highbar, 9.25.
Sidehorse specialist Ted Marcy proved he is still master of that
event as he twisted and spun his way to victory in both the
compulsories and the optionals. The defending Pac-8 champion began
his second season with the Cards with a 9.6 routine at Berkeley, the
highest score of any event in the competition. His 9.5 the following
evening was only slightly less impressive.
Howard Bessen was Stanford's other individual winner, scoring an
excellent 9.4 to take the rings event Saturday. The previous evening
