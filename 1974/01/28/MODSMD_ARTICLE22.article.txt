# 'Fun And Games' At Stanford Relays
## Swimmers Coast To Victory 
### STEVE BAKER 
It was fun and games at the
swim stadium Friday afternoon as
coach Jim Gaughran's swimmers
hosted the Stanford Relays. One
could hardly say it was a
high-pressure affair as many
swimmers swam races they
normally don't swim. Although
the Cards won, few people were
paying attention to the score.
For the record, the Stanford
"A" squad tallied 87 points while
Los Altos Aquatic Club with 62,
California's varsity with 57, Santa
Clara Swim Club with 51,
Stanford's "B" squad with 26,
Cal's JV's with 24 and Marin
Aquatic Club with 22, followed.
The Cards won the first three
events of the afternoon so the
outcome was decided early.
With tough meets behind them
and long hours of hard work in
preparation for the big meets
lying ahead, this meet was a
timely change of pace. Dave
Fairbank, appreciating the relaxed
atmosphere, said that he'd "like
more meets like this."
All-American Richard Cook
commented, "It was a fun meet,
enough to make me enjoy

swimming again."
To be sure, the Cardinal
swimmers strived for excellence in
each race they swam, but they
made sure they had fun at the
same time.
Exciting Event
Of all the events of the
program, the most notable were
the breaststroke relay, the
individual medley relay and the
400-yard medley relay. In what
was probably the most exciting
event of the afternoon, the
breaststrokers of Marin Aquatic
Club and Los Altos Aquatic Club
ended in a dead heat, just ahead
of John Hencken, Bruce Craig and
Dave Easton of the Cards.
The IM relay saw the usually
reliable Randy Whitchurch false
start twice, disqualifying Stanford
in that event. In the medley relay
the Cardinals got serious and won
by 20 yards in an awesome

display of power. Whitchurch,
Hencken, Brian Roux and Dave
Fairbank combined to clock a
3:34.4, compared to second place
Santa Clara's time of 3:46.3.
After the meeting, there was
talk among some swimmers over
the possibilities of swimming in
the nude. It has been theorized
that the swimmer "au naturel"
will go decidedly faster. But
although there was a suggestion
that the Cards swim Cal in the raw
when they meet here in February,
it seems rather doubtful.
Preparation
In the serious world of
swimming, the Cardinals now face
three weeks of preparation for
their encounters with UCLA and
USC in Los Angeles. And while
their primary concern will be
beating Bruins and Trojans, some
swimmers would like to settle a
score with Indiana at the same

time.
Indiana knocked Stanford out
of first place national rankings in
three events last week. Stanford's
sprint relay was one of the
Hoosiers' victims. Indiana
recorded a relay time of 3:03.33
compared to Stanford's best of
3:05.8. One of the members of
the Stanford quartet, Bruce
Goodwin said, "We'll just try to
go a 3:02 against UCLA."
Whether they do or not
means little, for the real test
comes in the NCAA
championships. Captain Martin
Pedley, surprised that Indiana
went so fast this early, said that in
the NCAA's "there could be two
relays under three minutes, but
we still figure on being the first
one to finish."
The fun and games are over
now and the serious business must
resume.
