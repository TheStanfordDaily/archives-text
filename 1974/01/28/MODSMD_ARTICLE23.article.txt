# Comeback Rugby Victory
## Cardiac Cards Edge SJS 
### CHRIS BAKER 
SAN JOSE — The Cardiac Kids
you say? Why sure, that was
USC's 1969 football squad, right?
Well not exactly. Stanford's rugby
team has also earned this
distinction. The Cards, trailing
San Jose State 10-3 in the first
half, came back to score 12 points
in the second half Saturday to
defeat the Spartans, 15-10.
Playing in a wind that seemed
more appropriate for Candlestick
Park, the Spartans dominated the
first half with some fine defensive
kicking. Terry Buchanan, "the
finest rugby player in Northern
California," according to Eric
Test, booted two kicks that
seemed to travel at least 60 yards.
Buchanan scored two penalty
kicks and a try in the first half.
"He played an incredible
game," Test said of the Spartan
player-coach.
Larry Lieberman got the Cards
on the board late in the first half
with a penalty kick, thus San Jose
took a 10-3 lead into the locker
room at halftime.
But the second half was a
different ball game. The Cards

came out hitting. John Anderson
caused one Spartan to spend the
rest of his weekend in the hospital
and Stanford controlled the
lineouts and scrums.
Craig Zaltosky and Test
teamed up for the first Card try of
the day. "Mr. Z" took a pass from
Test and showed several would-be
Spartan defenders why he won
the Pac-8 punt return
championship as he raced in for
the score. Lieberman added the
extra point and the Cards trailed
by one, 10-9.
The Cards got the ball again
and Forrie Martin set up a penalty
kick with running that would
qualify him to be in the backfield
of any Pac-8 football squad. But
Lieberman missed the kick and it
looked as though time might run
out before the Cards could score
again.
But "Mr. Z" came to the
rescue. Taking a pass from John
Anderson, the elusive Zaltosky
raced into the end zone to score
what turned out to be the winning
iry. Lieberman added the extra
point to give the Cards a 15-10
margin.
But the Spartans didn't quit.
They marched right back into
scoring position with the aid of
two consecutive Stanford
penalties. Stanford, however,
turned in its best defensive effort
of the young season with the
Spartans threatening from the
three-yard line. The intense
hitting stopped San Jose but may
have been very costly to the
Cards, as Zaltosky may be out for
the remainder of the year with a
separated shoulder. "But that's
life," said Zaltosky.
Stanford had beaten the
Spartans earlier in the year in the
informal Stanford 10-a-side
tournament, but some Stanford
players felt as though they played
a different team in the 10-a-side.
"San Jose was much improved
over their 10-a-side team. They
were in great shape," said Test.
"It was good to play on a dry
field again. We looked great in
lineouts and the scrums, but San
Jose had some great kicking," he
added.
San Jose State player-coach
Buchanan said "Stanford's
forwards were the key. They were
much more efficient at
dominating the ball. We had our

chances, but Stanford used theirs.
They had a monopoly on the
ball."
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
said, "We must not like to get
ahead. Two weeks of this is
enough [last week the Cards had
to come back to defeat the San
Francisco Rugby Club|. But we
were very fortunate. With that
terrible wind Buchanan can kill
you. But we controlled the
lineouts and the scrums and that
was the ball game."
Stanford is now 3-0 while the
Spartans are 3-1.

PARALLEL STRUCTURE — Bob Anderson hit a 9.2 highbar routine Saturday night, but his performance
in the parallel bars (above) was less spectacular. Stanford coach Sadao Hamada says he needs "one or two
more guys" to provide depth in those events.
SAN JOSE — The Cardiac Kids
you say? Why sure, that was
USC's 1969 football squad, right?
Well not exactly. Stanford's rugby
team has also earned this
distinction. The Cards, trailing
San Jose State 10-3 in the first
half, came back to score 12 points
in the second half Saturday to
defeat the Spartans, 15-10.
Playing in a wind that seemed
more appropriate for Candlestick
Park, the Spartans dominated the
first half with some fine defensive
kicking. Terry Buchanan, "the
finest rugby player in Northern
California," according to Eric
Test, booted two kicks that
seemed to travel at least 60 yards.
Buchanan scored two penalty
kicks and a try in the first half.
"He played an incredible
game," Test said of the Spartan
player-coach.
Larry Lieberman got the Cards
on the board late in the first half
with a penalty kick, thus San Jose
took a 10-3 lead into the locker
room at halftime.
But the second half was a
different ball game. The Cards

came out hitting. John Anderson
caused one Spartan to spend the
rest of his weekend in the hospital
and Stanford controlled the
lineouts and scrums.
Craig Zaltosky and Test
teamed up for the first Card try of
the day. "Mr. Z" took a pass from
Test and showed several would-be
Spartan defenders why he won
the Pac-8 punt return
championship as he raced in for
the score. Lieberman added the
extra point and the Cards trailed
by one, 10-9.
The Cards got the ball again
and Forrie Martin set up a penalty
kick with running that would
qualify him to be in the backfield
of any Pac-8 football squad. But
Lieberman missed the kick and it
looked as though time might run
out before the Cards could score
again.
But "Mr. Z" came to the
rescue. Taking a pass from John
Anderson, the elusive Zaltosky
raced into the end zone to score
what turned out to be the winning
iry. Lieberman added the extra
point to give the Cards a 15-10
margin.
But the Spartans didn't quit.
They marched right back into
scoring position with the aid of
two consecutive Stanford
penalties. Stanford, however,
turned in its best defensive effort
of the young season with the
Spartans threatening from the
three-yard line. The intense
hitting stopped San Jose but may
have been very costly to the
Cards, as Zaltosky may be out for
the remainder of the year with a
separated shoulder. "But that's
life," said Zaltosky.
Stanford had beaten the
Spartans earlier in the year in the
informal Stanford 10-a-side
tournament, but some Stanford
players felt as though they played
a different team in the 10-a-side.
"San Jose was much improved
