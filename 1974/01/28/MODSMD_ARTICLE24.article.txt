# Wrestlers Place 10th
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's wrestling team
placed 10th in the Cal State-San
Francisco tournament
weekend, despite lacking entries
in four of 10 weight classes.
Marc Frelier provided the
Cards with their biggest spark,
placing fourth in the 177 pound
division. Frelier lost to the same
opponent twice in the double
elimination tournament, but
coach Joe De Meo said he "did a
real good job."
Four other Stanford wrestlers
each won a single match. Jim
Tatarakis (126) got revenge by
pinning the Cal State-Hay ward
grappler who pinned him last
week. Tatarakis dominated the
match, according to De Meo, and
achieved at the very least, a big
personal victory.
Craig Reynolds (158), Jeff
Richardson (167) and Kris
Westersund (Hwt) each notched a
win, but were outclassed later in
the meet.
Mark Yancey (134), usually
one of the Card's star performers,
lost two tight matches.
De Meo said he "wasn't
disappointed in the showing,"
considering all factors, especially
numerous injuries. He admitted
that he "was kind of lax this
week," anticipating the four-day
joumey up north later this week.
During the trip, the Cards will
face Chico State, Oregon and
Oregon Tech & Pacific University.
Oregon always has tough teams,
but De Meo is hoping to return
from the trip with a winning
record. Currently the Cards are
5-5 in dual competition.
Two of the many injured
grapplers will begin workouts
today, which has to bring a smile
to De Meo's face. Gary Anderson
(Hwt) and Emmett Stanton (158)
will begin getting back into shape,
and should be back in action
soon.
