# Victory At Last! 108-Point Outburst Buries Pioneers
## Varsity Reserves Provide JV Punch 
### TIM FERGUSON 
SAN JOSE — With a little help
from their friends, the junior
varsity Cardinal cagers routed San
Jose City College, 66-43, here
Saturday night.
Engineered by the 12 rebounds
of Rich Wohlstadter and the 18
points of Mike Simons, both of
whom were down temporarily
from the varsity, the win balanced
a frustrating 76-71 loss to the San
Jose State JV at Maples Pavilion
the night before.
Simons had scored 10 straight
points with 8:40 left in the first
half Saturday to give Stanford a
24-10 lead, and the Cardinals
never allowed the clumsy Jaguars
to get close. Although Stanford
shot only 35 percent from the
floor in the first half, San Jose
managed only 21 percent and
trailed, 41-21, at the break.
Cardinal center Scott Russell
had another big night, scoring 15
points and grabbing 14 caroms, as
Stanford's record improved to
4-5.
Exhibiting sharpness on the
court in marked contrast to their
opponents, the maturing Cards
added to their lead in the second
half until Stanford coach Billy
Jones filled the lineup with subs
at 6:00 remaining and the Cards
ahead, 62-33.
Reserve guard Warner Session
showed the most noticeable
improvement, quarterbacking the
offense and exhibiting such
defensive quickness that he once
was able to sprint in front of a
driving Jaguar and draw a charging
foul.
Big Recruits
Some big freshman recruits
from Los Angeles proved the
difference for San Jose State
Friday, as expected, but not
before Cardinals Marty Moroski
and Sven Walker had put on a
dazzling offensive performance.
Spartans Grady Roberts and
Rick Younge scored 18 points
between them before Jones called
a time out at 13:20 of the first
half with Stanford trailing, 20-14.
Moroski and Walker then went to
work, and the Cards employed
what assistant coach Bob Buell
called a "hustle" defense to
virtually shut off L.A. high school
All-Star Roberts.
Walker's hanging jump shots
proved real crowd pleasers, and
they, together with Session's steal
and length-of-the-court drive for a
basket at 5:45, put Stanford
ahead. 32-30. The Cards held on
for a one-point halftime
advantage.
Stanford took charge early in
the second half. With nine
minutes gone, Walker completed a
three-point play which gave the
Cards their biggest lead, 54-44.
The harassed Spartans were
passing the ball to empty areas of
the court, and Stanford looked a
sure winner.
Disaster
Then disaster struck. Russell
left the game for a rest, and by

the time he returned Roberts was
scoring at will and had brought
the Spartans within one, 66-65.
The Cards' offensive stars began
committing turnovers and San
Jose received breaks that had
eluded it earlier, such as having
the ball tapped in their basket
during a skirmish for a rebound
(0:40).
The mistakes proved too costly
and the better Spartans took
charge. Younge's basket at 0:15
iced it, 74-69.
"1 guess you could say we sort
of folded under pressure,"
admitted Buell afterward. He
referred to "a little lack of poise
in parts" and "dumb mistakes —
we're a better team than that, we
really are."
Still, the offensive show by
Moroski and Walker (27 and 17
points, respectively) was an
uplifting one. Said Buell, "Marty
and Sven did a great job."

Jose received breaks that had
eluded it earlier, such as having
the ball tapped in their basket
during a skirmish for a rebound
(0:40).
The mistakes proved too costly
and the better Spartans took
charge. Younge's basket at 0:15
iced it, 74-69.
"1 guess you could say we sort
of folded under pressure,"
admitted Buell afterward. He
referred to "a little lack of poise
in parts" and "dumb mistakes —
we're a better team than that, we
really are."
Still, the offensive show by
Moroski and Walker (27 and 17
points, respectively) was an
uplifting one. Said Buell, "Marty
and Sven did a great job."

SAN JOSE — With a little help
from their friends, the junior
varsity Cardinal cagers routed San
Jose City College, 66-43, here
Saturday night.
Engineered by the 12 rebounds
of Rich Wohlstadter and the 18
points of Mike Simons, both of
whom were down temporarily
from the varsity, the win balanced
a frustrating 76-71 loss to the San
Jose State JV at Maples Pavilion
the night before.
Simons had scored 10 straight
points with 8:40 left in the first
half Saturday to give Stanford a
24-10 lead, and the Cardinals
never allowed the clumsy Jaguars
to get close. Although Stanford
shot only 35 percent from the
floor in the first half, San Jose
managed only 21 percent and
trailed, 41-21, at the break.
Cardinal center Scott Russell
had another big night, scoring 15
points and grabbing 14 caroms, as
Stanford's record improved to
4-5.
Exhibiting sharpness on the
court in marked contrast to their
opponents, the maturing Cards
added to their lead in the second
half until Stanford coach Billy
Jones filled the lineup with subs
at 6:00 remaining and the Cards
ahead, 62-33.
Reserve guard Warner Session
showed the most noticeable
improvement, quarterbacking the
offense and exhibiting such
defensive quickness that he once
was able to sprint in front of a
driving Jaguar and draw a charging
foul.
Big Recruits
Some big freshman recruits
from Los Angeles proved the
difference for San Jose State
Friday, as expected, but not
before Cardinals Marty Moroski
and Sven Walker had put on a
dazzling offensive performance.
Spartans Grady Roberts and
Rick Younge scored 18 points
between them before Jones called
a time out at 13:20 of the first
half with Stanford trailing, 20-14.
Moroski and Walker then went to
work, and the Cards employed
what assistant coach Bob Buell
called a "hustle" defense to
virtually shut off L.A. high school
All-Star Roberts.
Walker's hanging jump shots
proved real crowd pleasers, and
they, together with Session's steal
and length-of-the-court drive for a
basket at 5:45, put Stanford
ahead. 32-30. The Cards held on
for a one-point halftime
advantage.
Stanford took charge early in
the second half. With nine
minutes gone, Walker completed a
three-point play which gave the
Cards their biggest lead, 54-44.
The harassed Spartans were
passing the ball to empty areas of
the court, and Stanford looked a
sure winner.
Disaster
Then disaster struck. Russell
left the game for a rest, and by

the time he returned Roberts was
scoring at will and had brought
the Spartans within one, 66-65.
The Cards' offensive stars began
committing turnovers and San
Jose received breaks that had
eluded it earlier, such as having
the ball tapped in their basket
during a skirmish for a rebound
