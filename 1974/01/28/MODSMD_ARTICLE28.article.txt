## UCLA Regains Number-One Ranking 
### 
Everyone knew that UCLA wasn't going to
passively sit back and let Notre Dame remain as the
nation's top basketball team for more than a week.
And the Bruins didn't.
Saturday UCLA, behind a 32-point performance
by Bill Walton, outclassed the top-ranked Fighting
Irish 94-75 before 12,874 fanatics in Pauley
Pavilion. After the mismatch was over, even Notre
Dame coach Digger Phelps admitted "they're
Number One."
The Bruins' win was their 60th straight at home,
and avenged last-week's miracle 71-70 defeat at
South Bend. That game halted UCLA's win streak
at 88 games.
This time, it was "no contest" from the
beginning, as the Bruins jumped off to a 9-0 lead,
and, behind 18 points by Keith Wilkes, grabbed a
43-30 halftime lead.
Early in the second half Walton took over,
scoring 12 points in the first 10 minutes of the half
despite being in foul trouble. Walton eventually
fouled out with 5:39 to play, but by then it hardly
mattered.
Another Bruin standout was Marques Johnson,
who became the first freshman to start for Johnny
Wooden since 1952. Johnson, onlv 17. scored IB

points.
The Bruins' new winning streak stands at two
games, the first being a 96-54 triumph over Santa
Clara Friday night . Johnson won his starting job by
hitting 10 of 11 shots for 20 points.
In the week's only conference game, Oregon
earned the right to be "listed ahead of UCLA in the
conference standings by downing Oregon State
67-61. The Ducks are 5-0, the Bruins 4-0.
Oregon might not have won if three OSU players
hadn t fouled out. For one of the few times since
Dick Harter became the Duck coach, Oregon was
out-fouled.
USC enjoyed its Eastern vacation, downing
Seton Hall 79-68 and Fordhani 70-60 at Madison
Square Garden. The 12th ranked Trojans are now
14-2 for the year.
In Berkeley, Rickie Hawthorne led California to
a 62-60 win over San Jose State. The Bears trailed
by 12 at halftime, but Hawthorne, who finished
with 22 points, tossed in several baskets to erase
that lead. The sophomore hit a jumper from the
corner as time ran out to give Cal the win.
Washington improved its overall record to 9-7
with an 88-64 romp over Seattle. The Huskies
remain winless in the conference.
