# Grad Student Found Dead
## 
### 
Michael Phillips, 23, a graduate
student in communication, was found
dead in his car early yesterday, an
apparent suicide.
Stanford police discovered Phillips'
body and the car in the parking lot
next to the Athletic Department
corporation yard near Maples Pavilion
at 2:30 a.m.
The car windows were rolled up
and a hose from the exhaust pipe had
been inserted through a back window,
police said. A towel sealed the window
and the car had run out of gas.
In addition to being a master's
degree candidate in communication,
Phillips worked as a Daily reporter and
night editor. He joined the staff at the
beginning of the school year.
Daily Editor Jim Wascher described
Phillips as "a friendly person and a
promising member of the staff. His
death was quite a shock to us."
Phillips' death came as a surprise to
friends. However, he had been
"despondent," according to roommate
Steve Simon, a Ph.D. candidate in

computer science.
Phillips had packed his belongings
into his car and left campus last
Monday, but returned later that night.
He mentioned to friends then that he
had considered dropping out of the
master's program.
Communication Prof. William
Rivers, Phillips' adviser, termed the
student's apparent suicide "very
surprising. Mike was an able student
who was doing very well. He was an
awfully hard worker."
Riven? said Phillips was "quite
happy" just before Christmas while
interviewing for employment with
different newspapers. His
recommendations and prospects for a
job were very good, the professor
added.
Phillips is survived by his parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Phillips of
Rochester, Mich., and an older married
sister.
His campus residence was the
McFarland apartment complex in
Escondido Village.
