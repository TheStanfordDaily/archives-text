# Fast-Breaking Cardinals Snap Loss Streak At Six
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Ah, the good old days.
Remember back in 1971-72, when
Rich Kelley, Mark Gilberg, Melvin
Arterberrv, Mike Simons, Scott
Trobbe, Archie Dean and Ben
Bluitt played for the Stanford
freshman team.
It seems like centuries ago. Bub
Bowling, who coached that squad,
hadn't even worn his first pair of
double-knits, Kelley didn't have
any facial hair. Arterberry played
forward and Gilberg didn't
hesitate to shoot.
The frosh ran, and the frosh
won.
So Friday night's 108-62
victory over Denver not only
snapped a six-game losing streak,
it also brought back nostalgic
memories.
Oh, there were some new faces.
Sophomores Ed Schweitzer and
Tim Patterson contributed
immeasurably to Friday's rout,
scoring 40 points between them
and connecting on 18-24 field
goal attempts.
And senior Jim Montague
contributed with 13 points in his
most carefree effort of the season.
Belonged To Juniors
But Friday night really
belonged to Stanford's juniors — a
group of players who were
expected to reverse Stanford's
basketball fortunes but so far had
failed.
Those explosive, fast-breaking
freshmen of 1971-72 had matured
into slow, cautious juniors in
1973-74, and the result was a
six-game Stanford losing streak
and a disastrous midseason record
of 5-9.
But Friday night was different.

The fast break returned, much to
the delight of 3834 thoroughly
entertained fans at Maples
Pavilion.
And much to the chagrin of
Denver's inept and completely
soul-free Pioneers, who watched
flat-footed as Stanford literally
ran them off the court.
"They were red-hot and we
were white-cold," moaned Denver
coach A 1 Harden after the game.
"They ran well and shot like
hell."
Understatement
"Shot like hell" was an
understatement. The Cards
connected on 61 percent of their
shots overall, including a 68
percent outburst in the second
half.
"It was the first time all year
we played relaxed," said Stanford
coach Howie Dal 1 mar. "Before we
were playing with tenseness."
Stanford was so relaxed, in
fact, that the Cards didn't commit
a turnover for nearly 11 minutes
— quite an accomplishment for a
team that leads the Pac-8 in
belated Christmas gifts.
Schweitzer, who "played a
super game," according to
Dallmar, said "it all came
together. Everything was spread
out, so we didn't make so many
bad passes."
Patterson credited the Cardinal
explosion to "shorter outlet
passes. We were effective on the
fast break because we weren't
trying so many long passes."
Obviously, Stanford's 59-24
rebounding edge also contributed
to the success of the fast break.
"We always think of running,"
Dallmar said, denying charges that
Stanford had tried to slow things
down in earlier games. "Whenever
you can control the ball, kick it
out and go, you do."
It was just that in previous
games, the Cardinals never had the
opportunity. "They (Denver]
made things easy for us," Dallmar
said.
In all, 11 players scored for
Stanford, led by Schweitzer with
25, Kelley with 20 and Patterson
with 15. Those three players also
hauled down 32 rebounds.
Reserve Heroes
But the real heroes were the
reserves. Players like Montague,
whose 6-8 shooting performance
was so unexpected that Hardon
said "number 31 did a super job."
Numbers 25, 43, 45 and 13
weren't bad either. Archie Dean
played nine minutes of his usual
non-stop, frantic basketball,
scoring seven points and grabbing
three rebounds. "I would have
had 20 if I wasn't playing the
post." Archie insisted.
Scott Trobbe (six points, five
abounds) contributed his finest
effort of the season, as did Mike
Simons, who converted all four of
his field goal attempts. Three of
those shots came from somewhere

between 28 feet and the fourth
row of the bleachers. "It was just
like target practice," he said.
But the biggest shot of the
night was made by Mark Gilberg,
who meshed a 24-foot jumper
with 2:27 left to put the Cards
over the century mark for the first
time since Jan. 3, 1972.
Was the game the start of the
turnaround — the beginning of a
dramatic reversal for the now 6-9
Cardinals?
"I sure hope so," Dallmar said.
But all thoughts weren't positive.
"Now," the coach sighed, "they
all think they ought to start."

Cardinal Notes: The 46-point
victory represented Stanford's
biggest rout since the Cards
defeated the Pearl Harbor
Admirals 90-33 in 1962. It was
the greatest margin of victory
against collegiate competition
since Jan. 1, 1938, when Stanford
defeated Duquesne 92-27. Hank
Luisetti scored 50 points in that
game, Stanford's all-time
individual scoring record.
Stanford hosts California this
Friday at Maples and Cal coach
Dick Edwards is worried.
"Stanford's got to be the best 6-9
team around," Edwards told Palo
Alto Times sportswriter Larry
Lavelle after scouting Friday's
game. "They really asserted
themselves on the boards. And
their shooting!
"We've got to work awful hard
to keep them from controlling
both ends of the court." Edwards

were playing with tenseness."
Stanford was so relaxed, in
fact, that the Cards didn't commit
a turnover for nearly 11 minutes
— quite an accomplishment for a
team that leads the Pac-8 in
belated Christmas gifts.
Schweitzer, who "played a
super game," according to
Dallmar, said "it all came
together. Everything was spread
out, so we didn't make so many
bad passes."
Patterson credited the Cardinal
explosion to "shorter outlet
passes. We were effective on the
fast break because we weren't
trying so many long passes."
Obviously, Stanford's 59-24
rebounding edge also contributed
to the success of the fast break.
"We always think of running,"
Dallmar said, denying charges that
Stanford had tried to slow things
down in earlier games. "Whenever
you can control the ball, kick it
out and go, you do."
It was just that in previous
games, the Cardinals never had the
opportunity. "They (Denver]
made things easy for us," Dallmar
said.
In all, 11 players scored for
Stanford, led by Schweitzer with
25, Kelley with 20 and Patterson
with 15. Those three players also
hauled down 32 rebounds.
Reserve Heroes
But the real heroes were the
reserves. Players like Montague,
whose 6-8 shooting performance
was so unexpected that Hardon
said "number 31 did a super job."
Numbers 25, 43, 45 and 13
weren't bad either. Archie Dean
played nine minutes of his usual
non-stop, frantic basketball,
scoring seven points and grabbing
three rebounds. "I would have
had 20 if I wasn't playing the
post." Archie insisted.
Scott Trobbe (six points, five
abounds) contributed his finest
effort of the season, as did Mike
Simons, who converted all four of
his field goal attempts. Three of
those shots came from somewhere

between 28 feet and the fourth
row of the bleachers. "It was just
like target practice," he said.
But the biggest shot of the
night was made by Mark Gilberg,
who meshed a 24-foot jumper
with 2:27 left to put the Cards
over the century mark for the first
time since Jan. 3, 1972.
Was the game the start of the
turnaround — the beginning of a
dramatic reversal for the now 6-9
Cardinals?
"I sure hope so," Dallmar said.
But all thoughts weren't positive.
"Now," the coach sighed, "they
all think they ought to start."

Cardinal Notes: The 46-point
victory represented Stanford's
biggest rout since the Cards
defeated the Pearl Harbor
Admirals 90-33 in 1962. It was
the greatest margin of victory
against collegiate competition
since Jan. 1, 1938, when Stanford
defeated Duquesne 92-27. Hank
Luisetti scored 50 points in that
game, Stanford's all-time
individual scoring record.
Stanford hosts California this
Friday at Maples and Cal coach
Dick Edwards is worried.
"Stanford's got to be the best 6-9
team around," Edwards told Palo
Alto Times sportswriter Larry
Lavelle after scouting Friday's
game. "They really asserted
themselves on the boards. And
their shooting!
"We've got to work awful hard
to keep them from controlling
both ends of the court." Edwards
said
Ah, the good old days.
Remember back in 1971-72, when
Rich Kelley, Mark Gilberg, Melvin
Arterberrv, Mike Simons, Scott
Trobbe, Archie Dean and Ben
Bluitt played for the Stanford
freshman team.
It seems like centuries ago. Bub
Bowling, who coached that squad,
hadn't even worn his first pair of
double-knits, Kelley didn't have
any facial hair. Arterberry played
forward and Gilberg didn't
hesitate to shoot.
The frosh ran, and the frosh
won.
So Friday night's 108-62
victory over Denver not only
snapped a six-game losing streak,
it also brought back nostalgic
memories.
Oh, there were some new faces.
Sophomores Ed Schweitzer and
Tim Patterson contributed
immeasurably to Friday's rout,
scoring 40 points between them
and connecting on 18-24 field
goal attempts.
And senior Jim Montague
contributed with 13 points in his
most carefree effort of the season.
Belonged To Juniors
But Friday night really
belonged to Stanford's juniors — a
group of players who were
expected to reverse Stanford's
basketball fortunes but so far had
failed.
Those explosive, fast-breaking
freshmen of 1971-72 had matured
into slow, cautious juniors in
1973-74, and the result was a
six-game Stanford losing streak
and a disastrous midseason record
of 5-9.
But Friday night was different.

The fast break returned, much to
the delight of 3834 thoroughly
entertained fans at Maples
Pavilion.
And much to the chagrin of
Denver's inept and completely
soul-free Pioneers, who watched
flat-footed as Stanford literally
ran them off the court.
"They were red-hot and we
were white-cold," moaned Denver
coach A 1 Harden after the game.
"They ran well and shot like
hell."
Understatement
"Shot like hell" was an
understatement. The Cards
connected on 61 percent of their
shots overall, including a 68
percent outburst in the second
half.
"It was the first time all year
we played relaxed," said Stanford
coach Howie Dal 1 mar. "Before we
were playing with tenseness."

Cardinal Notes: The 46-point
victory represented Stanford's
biggest rout since the Cards
defeated the Pearl Harbor
Admirals 90-33 in 1962. It was
the greatest margin of victory
against collegiate competition
since Jan. 1, 1938, when Stanford
defeated Duquesne 92-27. Hank
Luisetti scored 50 points in that
game, Stanford's all-time
individual scoring record.
Stanford hosts California this
Friday at Maples and Cal coach
Dick Edwards is worried.
"Stanford's got to be the best 6-9
team around," Edwards told Palo
Alto Times sportswriter Larry
Lavelle after scouting Friday's
game. "They really asserted
themselves on the boards. And
their shooting!
"We've got to work awful hard
to keep them from controlling
both ends of the court." Edwards
said
Ah, the good old days.
Remember back in 1971-72, when
Rich Kelley, Mark Gilberg, Melvin
Arterberrv, Mike Simons, Scott
Trobbe, Archie Dean and Ben
Bluitt played for the Stanford
freshman team.
It seems like centuries ago. Bub
Bowling, who coached that squad,
hadn't even worn his first pair of
double-knits, Kelley didn't have
any facial hair. Arterberry played
forward and Gilberg didn't
hesitate to shoot.
The frosh ran, and the frosh
won.
So Friday night's 108-62
victory over Denver not only
snapped a six-game losing streak,
it also brought back nostalgic
memories.
Oh, there were some new faces.
Sophomores Ed Schweitzer and
Tim Patterson contributed
immeasurably to Friday's rout,
scoring 40 points between them
and connecting on 18-24 field
goal attempts.
And senior Jim Montague
contributed with 13 points in his
most carefree effort of the season.
Belonged To Juniors
But Friday night really
belonged to Stanford's juniors — a
group of players who were
expected to reverse Stanford's
basketball fortunes but so far had
failed.
Those explosive, fast-breaking
freshmen of 1971-72 had matured
into slow, cautious juniors in
1973-74, and the result was a
six-game Stanford losing streak
and a disastrous midseason record
of 5-9.
But Friday night was different.

The fast break returned, much to
the delight of 3834 thoroughly
entertained fans at Maples
Pavilion.
And much to the chagrin of
Denver's inept and completely
soul-free Pioneers, who watched
flat-footed as Stanford literally
ran them off the court.
"They were red-hot and we
were white-cold," moaned Denver
coach A 1 Harden after the game.
"They ran well and shot like
hell."
Understatement
"Shot like hell" was an
understatement. The Cards
connected on 61 percent of their
shots overall, including a 68
percent outburst in the second
half.
"It was the first time all year
we played relaxed," said Stanford
coach Howie Dal 1 mar. "Before we
were playing with tenseness."
Stanford was so relaxed, in
fact, that the Cards didn't commit
a turnover for nearly 11 minutes
— quite an accomplishment for a
team that leads the Pac-8 in
belated Christmas gifts.
Schweitzer, who "played a
super game," according to
Dallmar, said "it all came
together. Everything was spread
out, so we didn't make so many
bad passes."
Patterson credited the Cardinal
explosion to "shorter outlet
passes. We were effective on the
fast break because we weren't
trying so many long passes."
Obviously, Stanford's 59-24
rebounding edge also contributed
to the success of the fast break.
"We always think of running,"
Dallmar said, denying charges that
Stanford had tried to slow things
down in earlier games. "Whenever
you can control the ball, kick it
out and go, you do."
It was just that in previous
games, the Cardinals never had the
opportunity. "They (Denver]
made things easy for us," Dallmar
said.
In all, 11 players scored for
Stanford, led by Schweitzer with
25, Kelley with 20 and Patterson
with 15. Those three players also
hauled down 32 rebounds.
Reserve Heroes
But the real heroes were the
reserves. Players like Montague,
whose 6-8 shooting performance
was so unexpected that Hardon
said "number 31 did a super job."
Numbers 25, 43, 45 and 13
weren't bad either. Archie Dean
played nine minutes of his usual
non-stop, frantic basketball,
scoring seven points and grabbing
three rebounds. "I would have
had 20 if I wasn't playing the
post." Archie insisted.
Scott Trobbe (six points, five
abounds) contributed his finest
effort of the season, as did Mike
Simons, who converted all four of
his field goal attempts. Three of
those shots came from somewhere

between 28 feet and the fourth
row of the bleachers. "It was just
like target practice," he said.
But the biggest shot of the
night was made by Mark Gilberg,
who meshed a 24-foot jumper
with 2:27 left to put the Cards
over the century mark for the first
time since Jan. 3, 1972.
Was the game the start of the
turnaround — the beginning of a
dramatic reversal for the now 6-9
Cardinals?
