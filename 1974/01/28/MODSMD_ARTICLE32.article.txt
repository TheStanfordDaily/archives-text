Middle East Fighting Continues
Syrian and Israeli gunners traded tank and
artillery fire on the Golan Heights for the second
straight day yesterday, and Syria claimed at least 40
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded.
The Israeli military command denied any
casualties, and reports from the two sides also
differed on the length of the clashes.
Syrian communiques reported two separate
shelling duels, a 40-minute exchange on the
southern sector of the front and another to the
north lasting nearly two hours.
Syria said at least 10 Israelis were hit in the first
exchange and at least 30 in the second. In addition,
the reports said Israel lost 11 artillery batteries, a
rocket base, a munitions dump and other
equipment. The communique said four Syrians were
wounded and one Syrian truck was destroyed.
The Israeli military command said the exchange
lasted intermittently for almost five hours.
Israel's Cabinet said it was willing to discuss
troop disengagement with Syria as soon as the
Damascus government submits lists of Israeli war
prisoners and permits Red Cross visits. The
statement was issued after the Cabinet studied
secret proposals brought from Damascus last
weekend by American Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger.
Hawaii Begins Gas Rationing
HONOLULU, Hawaii — The nation's first
mandatory gasoline rationing program goes into
effect in Hawaii today and motorists hope the plan
will shorten the long lines at local service stations.
Details of the program were announced over the
weekend by acting Gov. George Ariyoshi.
It is based on the odd-even license plate concept,
similar to Oregon's voluntary program. Cars with
odd-numbered license plates can fill up on odd
numbered days, and even-numbered plates can get
gasoline on even-numbered days. Emergency
vehicles are exempt.
Other details were:
— Cars eligible for fuel must have no more than
one-quarter tank of gasoline when they pull into the
station;
— Stations must open at 6 a.m. or earlier, but
have to close during rush hour traffic times;
Ariyoshi noted that the program — which he
described as "emergency rules and regulations" —
was put together in less than three days.
"This plan is not perfect. . ." he said. "We may
have to modify it, but. we're doing this to bring
things back to normal for Hawaii drivers."
He said he would set up a special committee to
formulate a coupon-type gasoline rationing
program. "In case we need something more drastic,
we want to be ready," Ariyoshi explained.
Nixon To Address The Nation
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will deliver
the annual State of the Union message this week,
with interest in the speech heightened by the
impeachment cloud hanging over him.

The President will address a joint session of
Congress and a national television audience at 9
p.m. Wednesday.
Nixon will outline his legislative program in the
address. He also is expected to use the occasion to
try to convince the American public his ability to
govern has not been crippled by the series of
Watergate disclosures.
The day after Nixon's appearance the House
Judiciary Committee, which is conducting an
investigation to see whether grounds exist for
impeaching him, will meet to act on a resolution
granting the committee broad authority to
subpoena White House officials and documents.
The resolution also will restate the committee's
authority to conduct a full investigation of the
President's conduct.
Nationwide Rationing "Necessary'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Henry M. Jackson, whose
subcommittee on investigations held three days of
hearings last week on the energy crisis, said
yesterday that gasoline rationing may be necessary
by the second quarter of the year unless the Arab
nations resume oil shipments.
"I believe the present situation clearly indicates
that in the second quarter we're going to be in a
posture where gas rationing may well be a reality,"
he said. "I don't think there's much doubt about it.
unless there are some developments overseas which
would indicate that we will get extra crude
material."
A vote on final passage of the Emergency Energy-
Act is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon in the
Senate. This is the bill giving Nixon discretionary
powers to deal with the energy crisis.
Britain May Shorten Work Week
LONDON — Lord Carrington, Britain's energy
minister, said yesterday a complete strike by the
nation's coal miners could reduce British industry to
a two-day work week.
"If the miners do decide to go for a strike, the
situation will be that we shall not be on a three-day
week but something much less," he said in a radio
interview.
Asked to explain what he meant, Carrington
said: "Less than a three-day week is obviously a 2 x /i
or a two-day week."
Anxiety over labor strife and threatened
industrial breakdown have already pushed public
attitudes to the point that army troops are reported
training with police in case of a peril to public
order.
Brezhnev To Arrive In Cuba
MIAMI, Fla. — Soviet Communist party boss
Leonid I. Brezhnev arrives in Havana this week amid
speculation about a possible renewal of relations
between the United States and Cuba.
Brezhnev's visit is the first by a top Kremlin
leader to the Caribbean island since Premier Alexei
N. Kosygin spent five days theryin October, 1971.
Prime Minister Fidel Castro made his third trip to
Moscow in the summer of 1972.
Havana radio, monitored in Miami, said Brezhnev
was coming to Cuba "for an official, friendly visit"
at Castro's invitation.
The Russian's trip had been scheduled long
before the newest round of speculation over a
U.S.-Cuban thaw, which began after Cuba's
ambassador to Mexico remarked to newsmen that
Cuba would be willing to negotiate with Washington
if a U.S. economic blockade of the island was lifted.
Some foreign observers believe Russia would
welcome a Cuban-American arrangement and that
Brezhnev will push for this in his talks with Castro.
But officially, both Washington and Havana say
nothing has happened to change their positions.

Ford Leads Presidential Poll
PRINCETON, N.J. — Vice President Gerald Ford
is the leading choice for the 1976 Republican
Presidential nomination, according to the latest
Gallup Poll.
With the support of 24 percent of 377
Republican voters polled Jan. 4 to 7, the Vice
President emerged as the leading contender from a
list of 10 "people who have been mentioned as
possible presidential candidates for the Republican
Party."
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California was second
with 20 percent, followed by former New York
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, who received 18
percent.
Battle Rages In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government troops
struck at the center of the insurgent drive toward
Phnom Penh yesterday, retaking a two-mile stretch
along the city's southern front, field reports said.
The government move was an initial step toward
eliminating the almost daily artillery barrages
against the capital, which began Dec. 23, and so far
have killed 145 persons and wounded 354. The bulk
of the casualties have come in the past three days.
Marijuana Petition Floundering
LOS ANGELES — Promoters hoping to place a
marijuana decriminalization petition on the
November ballot say their signature drive is lagging
in the facing of a Feb. 18 deadline.
Fran McDermott of the Marijuana Reform
League said during the weekend that only 175,000
of 325,504 necessary signatures have been obtained.
The drive is running about 150,000 signatures short
at this point, three months after petitions began
circulating, she said.
Tightening Of Bank Rules Urged
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve Board
urged Congress yesterday to strengthen its
anti-inflation powers by requiring about 5000 banks
to obey reserve rules on their checking accounts for
the first time.
If the board's sweeping proposal is adopted, it
could tell nonmember banks how much of the
estimated $50 billion deposited in their checking
accounts must be kept on hand as reserves.
The legislation would give the independent
central bank authority to set reserve amounts on
about 97 percent of demand deposits nationally. It
now has power over about 75 percent.
It is through this official tying up of cash that
the Federal Reserve can control the flow of money
to the economy and, to a large extent, the amount
of money banks have to lend to consumers.
('age Star To Run For Congress
TRENTON, N.J. — Bill Bradley of the New York
Knicks has told Democratic leaders in New Jersey
he has decided to run for Congress in the 13th
District, it was learned yesterday.
Bradley is actively seeking a campaign manager
and he visited Trenton last week seeking help and

Some foreign observers believe Russia would

But officially, both Washington and Havana say
nothing has happened to change their positions.

Battle Rages In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government troops
struck at the center of the insurgent drive toward
Phnom Penh yesterday, retaking a two-mile stretch
along the city's southern front, field reports said.
The government move was an initial step toward
eliminating the almost daily artillery barrages
against the capital, which began Dec. 23, and so far
have killed 145 persons and wounded 354. The bulk
of the casualties have come in the past three days.
Marijuana Petition Floundering
LOS ANGELES — Promoters hoping to place a

November ballot say their signature drive is lagging
in the facing of a Feb. 18 deadline.
Fran McDermott of the Marijuana Reform
League said during the weekend that only 175,000
of 325,504 necessary signatures have been obtained.
The drive is running about 150,000 signatures short
at this point, three months after petitions began
circulating, she said.
Tightening Of Bank Rules Urged
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve Board
urged Congress yesterday to strengthen its
anti-inflation powers by requiring about 5000 banks
to obey reserve rules on their checking accounts for
the first time.
If the board's sweeping proposal is adopted, it
could tell nonmember banks how much of the
estimated $50 billion deposited in their checking
accounts must be kept on hand as reserves.
The legislation would give the independent
central bank authority to set reserve amounts on
about 97 percent of demand deposits nationally. It
now has power over about 75 percent.
It is through this official tying up of cash that
the Federal Reserve can control the flow of money
to the economy and, to a large extent, the amount
of money banks have to lend to consumers.

Middle East Fighting Continues
Syrian and Israeli gunners traded tank and
artillery fire on the Golan Heights for the second
straight day yesterday, and Syria claimed at least 40
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded.
The Israeli military command denied any
casualties, and reports from the two sides also
differed on the length of the clashes.
Syrian communiques reported two separate
shelling duels, a 40-minute exchange on the
southern sector of the front and another to the
north lasting nearly two hours.
Syria said at least 10 Israelis were hit in the first
exchange and at least 30 in the second. In addition,
the reports said Israel lost 11 artillery batteries, a
rocket base, a munitions dump and other
equipment. The communique said four Syrians were
wounded and one Syrian truck was destroyed.
The Israeli military command said the exchange
lasted intermittently for almost five hours.
Israel's Cabinet said it was willing to discuss
troop disengagement with Syria as soon as the
Damascus government submits lists of Israeli war
prisoners and permits Red Cross visits. The
statement was issued after the Cabinet studied
secret proposals brought from Damascus last
weekend by American Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger.
Hawaii Begins Gas Rationing
HONOLULU, Hawaii — The nation's first
mandatory gasoline rationing program goes into
effect in Hawaii today and motorists hope the plan
will shorten the long lines at local service stations.
Details of the program were announced over the
weekend by acting Gov. George Ariyoshi.
It is based on the odd-even license plate concept,
similar to Oregon's voluntary program. Cars with
odd-numbered license plates can fill up on odd
numbered days, and even-numbered plates can get
gasoline on even-numbered days. Emergency
vehicles are exempt.
Other details were:
— Cars eligible for fuel must have no more than
one-quarter tank of gasoline when they pull into the
station;
— Stations must open at 6 a.m. or earlier, but
have to close during rush hour traffic times;
Ariyoshi noted that the program — which he
described as "emergency rules and regulations" —
was put together in less than three days.
"This plan is not perfect. . ." he said. "We may
have to modify it, but. we're doing this to bring
things back to normal for Hawaii drivers."
He said he would set up a special committee to
formulate a coupon-type gasoline rationing
program. "In case we need something more drastic,
we want to be ready," Ariyoshi explained.
Nixon To Address The Nation
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will deliver
the annual State of the Union message this week,
with interest in the speech heightened by the
impeachment cloud hanging over him.

The President will address a joint session of
Congress and a national television audience at 9
p.m. Wednesday.
Nixon will outline his legislative program in the
address. He also is expected to use the occasion to
try to convince the American public his ability to
govern has not been crippled by the series of
Watergate disclosures.
The day after Nixon's appearance the House
Judiciary Committee, which is conducting an
investigation to see whether grounds exist for
impeaching him, will meet to act on a resolution
granting the committee broad authority to
subpoena White House officials and documents.
The resolution also will restate the committee's
authority to conduct a full investigation of the
President's conduct.
Nationwide Rationing "Necessary'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Henry M. Jackson, whose
subcommittee on investigations held three days of
hearings last week on the energy crisis, said
yesterday that gasoline rationing may be necessary
by the second quarter of the year unless the Arab
nations resume oil shipments.
"I believe the present situation clearly indicates
that in the second quarter we're going to be in a
posture where gas rationing may well be a reality,"
he said. "I don't think there's much doubt about it.
unless there are some developments overseas which
would indicate that we will get extra crude
material."
A vote on final passage of the Emergency Energy-
Act is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon in the
Senate. This is the bill giving Nixon discretionary
powers to deal with the energy crisis.
Britain May Shorten Work Week
LONDON — Lord Carrington, Britain's energy
minister, said yesterday a complete strike by the
nation's coal miners could reduce British industry to
a two-day work week.
"If the miners do decide to go for a strike, the
situation will be that we shall not be on a three-day
week but something much less," he said in a radio
interview.
Asked to explain what he meant, Carrington
said: "Less than a three-day week is obviously a 2 x /i
or a two-day week."
Anxiety over labor strife and threatened
industrial breakdown have already pushed public
attitudes to the point that army troops are reported
training with police in case of a peril to public
order.
Brezhnev To Arrive In Cuba
MIAMI, Fla. — Soviet Communist party boss
Leonid I. Brezhnev arrives in Havana this week amid

— Cars eligible for fuel must have no more than
one-quarter tank of gasoline when they pull into the
station;
— Stations must open at 6 a.m. or earlier, but
have to close during rush hour traffic times;
Ariyoshi noted that the program — which he
described as "emergency rules and regulations" —
was put together in less than three days.
"This plan is not perfect. . ." he said. "We may
have to modify it, but. we're doing this to bring
things back to normal for Hawaii drivers."
He said he would set up a special committee to
formulate a coupon-type gasoline rationing
program. "In case we need something more drastic,
we want to be ready," Ariyoshi explained.
Nixon To Address The Nation
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will deliver
the annual State of the Union message this week,
with interest in the speech heightened by the
impeachment cloud hanging over him.

The President will address a joint session of
Congress and a national television audience at 9
p.m. Wednesday.
Nixon will outline his legislative program in the
address. He also is expected to use the occasion to
try to convince the American public his ability to
govern has not been crippled by the series of
Watergate disclosures.
The day after Nixon's appearance the House
Judiciary Committee, which is conducting an
investigation to see whether grounds exist for
impeaching him, will meet to act on a resolution
granting the committee broad authority to
subpoena White House officials and documents.
The resolution also will restate the committee's
authority to conduct a full investigation of the
President's conduct.
Nationwide Rationing "Necessary'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Henry M. Jackson, whose
subcommittee on investigations held three days of
hearings last week on the energy crisis, said
yesterday that gasoline rationing may be necessary
by the second quarter of the year unless the Arab
nations resume oil shipments.
"I believe the present situation clearly indicates
that in the second quarter we're going to be in a
posture where gas rationing may well be a reality,"
he said. "I don't think there's much doubt about it.
unless there are some developments overseas which
would indicate that we will get extra crude
material."
A vote on final passage of the Emergency Energy-
Act is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon in the
Senate. This is the bill giving Nixon discretionary
powers to deal with the energy crisis.
Britain May Shorten Work Week
LONDON — Lord Carrington, Britain's energy

nation's coal miners could reduce British industry to
a two-day work week.
"If the miners do decide to go for a strike, the
situation will be that we shall not be on a three-day
week but something much less," he said in a radio
interview.
Asked to explain what he meant, Carrington
said: "Less than a three-day week is obviously a 2 x /i

Anxiety over labor strife and threatened
industrial breakdown have already pushed public
attitudes to the point that army troops are reported
training with police in case of a peril to public
order.
Brezhnev To Arrive In Cuba
MIAMI, Fla. — Soviet Communist party boss
Leonid I. Brezhnev arrives in Havana this week amid
speculation about a possible renewal of relations
between the United States and Cuba.
Brezhnev's visit is the first by a top Kremlin
leader to the Caribbean island since Premier Alexei
N. Kosygin spent five days theryin October, 1971.
Prime Minister Fidel Castro made his third trip to
Moscow in the summer of 1972.
Havana radio, monitored in Miami, said Brezhnev
was coming to Cuba "for an official, friendly visit"
at Castro's invitation.
The Russian's trip had been scheduled long
before the newest round of speculation over a
U.S.-Cuban thaw, which began after Cuba's
ambassador to Mexico remarked to newsmen that
Cuba would be willing to negotiate with Washington
if a U.S. economic blockade of the island was lifted.
Some foreign observers believe Russia would
welcome a Cuban-American arrangement and that
Brezhnev will push for this in his talks with Castro.
But officially, both Washington and Havana say
nothing has happened to change their positions.

Battle Rages In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government troops
struck at the center of the insurgent drive toward
Phnom Penh yesterday, retaking a two-mile stretch
along the city's southern front, field reports said.
The government move was an initial step toward
eliminating the almost daily artillery barrages
against the capital, which began Dec. 23, and so far
have killed 145 persons and wounded 354. The bulk
of the casualties have come in the past three days.
Marijuana Petition Floundering
LOS ANGELES — Promoters hoping to place a
marijuana decriminalization petition on the
November ballot say their signature drive is lagging
in the facing of a Feb. 18 deadline.
Fran McDermott of the Marijuana Reform
League said during the weekend that only 175,000
of 325,504 necessary signatures have been obtained.
The drive is running about 150,000 signatures short
at this point, three months after petitions began
circulating, she said.
Tightening Of Bank Rules Urged
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve Board
urged Congress yesterday to strengthen its
anti-inflation powers by requiring about 5000 banks
to obey reserve rules on their checking accounts for
the first time.
If the board's sweeping proposal is adopted, it
could tell nonmember banks how much of the
estimated $50 billion deposited in their checking
accounts must be kept on hand as reserves.
The legislation would give the independent
central bank authority to set reserve amounts on
about 97 percent of demand deposits nationally. It
now has power over about 75 percent.
It is through this official tying up of cash that
the Federal Reserve can control the flow of money
to the economy and, to a large extent, the amount
of money banks have to lend to consumers.
('age Star To Run For Congress
TRENTON, N.J. — Bill Bradley of the New York
Knicks has told Democratic leaders in New Jersey
he has decided to run for Congress in the 13th
District, it was learned yesterday.
Bradley is actively seeking a campaign manager
and he visited Trenton last week seeking help and

Democrats.
The 30-year-old former Rhodes scholar and
Princeton University All-American basketball star
said recently he had not mady up his mind whether
to run.
Today's Weather

Middle East Fighting Continues
Syrian and Israeli gunners traded tank and
artillery fire on the Golan Heights for the second
straight day yesterday, and Syria claimed at least 40
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded.
The Israeli military command denied any
casualties, and reports from the two sides also
differed on the length of the clashes.
Syrian communiques reported two separate
shelling duels, a 40-minute exchange on the
southern sector of the front and another to the
north lasting nearly two hours.
Syria said at least 10 Israelis were hit in the first
exchange and at least 30 in the second. In addition,
the reports said Israel lost 11 artillery batteries, a
rocket base, a munitions dump and other
equipment. The communique said four Syrians were
wounded and one Syrian truck was destroyed.
The Israeli military command said the exchange
lasted intermittently for almost five hours.
Israel's Cabinet said it was willing to discuss
troop disengagement with Syria as soon as the
Damascus government submits lists of Israeli war
prisoners and permits Red Cross visits. The
statement was issued after the Cabinet studied
secret proposals brought from Damascus last
weekend by American Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger.
Hawaii Begins Gas Rationing
HONOLULU, Hawaii — The nation's first
mandatory gasoline rationing program goes into
effect in Hawaii today and motorists hope the plan
will shorten the long lines at local service stations.
Details of the program were announced over the
weekend by acting Gov. George Ariyoshi.
It is based on the odd-even license plate concept,
similar to Oregon's voluntary program. Cars with
odd-numbered license plates can fill up on odd
numbered days, and even-numbered plates can get
gasoline on even-numbered days. Emergency
vehicles are exempt.
Other details were:
— Cars eligible for fuel must have no more than
one-quarter tank of gasoline when they pull into the
station;
— Stations must open at 6 a.m. or earlier, but
have to close during rush hour traffic times;
Ariyoshi noted that the program — which he

The drive is running about 150,000 signatures short
at this point, three months after petitions began

Tightening Of Bank Rules Urged
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve Board
urged Congress yesterday to strengthen its
anti-inflation powers by requiring about 5000 banks
to obey reserve rules on their checking accounts for
the first time.
If the board's sweeping proposal is adopted, it
could tell nonmember banks how much of the
estimated $50 billion deposited in their checking
accounts must be kept on hand as reserves.
The legislation would give the independent
central bank authority to set reserve amounts on
about 97 percent of demand deposits nationally. It
now has power over about 75 percent.
It is through this official tying up of cash that
the Federal Reserve can control the flow of money
to the economy and, to a large extent, the amount
of money banks have to lend to consumers.

Middle East Fighting Continues
Syrian and Israeli gunners traded tank and
artillery fire on the Golan Heights for the second
straight day yesterday, and Syria claimed at least 40
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded.
The Israeli military command denied any
casualties, and reports from the two sides also
differed on the length of the clashes.
Syrian communiques reported two separate
shelling duels, a 40-minute exchange on the
southern sector of the front and another to the
north lasting nearly two hours.
Syria said at least 10 Israelis were hit in the first
exchange and at least 30 in the second. In addition,
the reports said Israel lost 11 artillery batteries, a
rocket base, a munitions dump and other
equipment. The communique said four Syrians were
wounded and one Syrian truck was destroyed.
The Israeli military command said the exchange
lasted intermittently for almost five hours.
Israel's Cabinet said it was willing to discuss
troop disengagement with Syria as soon as the
Damascus government submits lists of Israeli war
prisoners and permits Red Cross visits. The
statement was issued after the Cabinet studied
secret proposals brought from Damascus last
weekend by American Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger.
Hawaii Begins Gas Rationing
HONOLULU, Hawaii — The nation's first
mandatory gasoline rationing program goes into
effect in Hawaii today and motorists hope the plan
will shorten the long lines at local service stations.
Details of the program were announced over the
weekend by acting Gov. George Ariyoshi.
It is based on the odd-even license plate concept,
similar to Oregon's voluntary program. Cars with
odd-numbered license plates can fill up on odd
numbered days, and even-numbered plates can get
gasoline on even-numbered days. Emergency
vehicles are exempt.
Other details were:
— Cars eligible for fuel must have no more than
one-quarter tank of gasoline when they pull into the
station;
— Stations must open at 6 a.m. or earlier, but
have to close during rush hour traffic times;
Ariyoshi noted that the program — which he
described as "emergency rules and regulations" —
was put together in less than three days.
"This plan is not perfect. . ." he said. "We may
have to modify it, but. we're doing this to bring
things back to normal for Hawaii drivers."
He said he would set up a special committee to
formulate a coupon-type gasoline rationing
program. "In case we need something more drastic,
we want to be ready," Ariyoshi explained.
Nixon To Address The Nation
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will deliver
the annual State of the Union message this week,
with interest in the speech heightened by the
impeachment cloud hanging over him.

The President will address a joint session of
Congress and a national television audience at 9
p.m. Wednesday.
Nixon will outline his legislative program in the
address. He also is expected to use the occasion to
try to convince the American public his ability to
govern has not been crippled by the series of
Watergate disclosures.
The day after Nixon's appearance the House
Judiciary Committee, which is conducting an
investigation to see whether grounds exist for
impeaching him, will meet to act on a resolution
granting the committee broad authority to
subpoena White House officials and documents.
The resolution also will restate the committee's
authority to conduct a full investigation of the
President's conduct.
Nationwide Rationing "Necessary'
WASHINGTON — Sen. Henry M. Jackson, whose
subcommittee on investigations held three days of
hearings last week on the energy crisis, said
yesterday that gasoline rationing may be necessary
by the second quarter of the year unless the Arab
nations resume oil shipments.
"I believe the present situation clearly indicates
that in the second quarter we're going to be in a
posture where gas rationing may well be a reality,"
he said. "I don't think there's much doubt about it.
unless there are some developments overseas which
would indicate that we will get extra crude
material."
A vote on final passage of the Emergency Energy-
Act is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon in the
Senate. This is the bill giving Nixon discretionary
powers to deal with the energy crisis.
Britain May Shorten Work Week
LONDON — Lord Carrington, Britain's energy
minister, said yesterday a complete strike by the
nation's coal miners could reduce British industry to
a two-day work week.
"If the miners do decide to go for a strike, the
situation will be that we shall not be on a three-day
week but something much less," he said in a radio
interview.
Asked to explain what he meant, Carrington
said: "Less than a three-day week is obviously a 2 x /i
or a two-day week."
Anxiety over labor strife and threatened
industrial breakdown have already pushed public
attitudes to the point that army troops are reported
training with police in case of a peril to public
order.
Brezhnev To Arrive In Cuba
MIAMI, Fla. — Soviet Communist party boss
Leonid I. Brezhnev arrives in Havana this week amid
speculation about a possible renewal of relations
between the United States and Cuba.
Brezhnev's visit is the first by a top Kremlin
leader to the Caribbean island since Premier Alexei
N. Kosygin spent five days theryin October, 1971.
Prime Minister Fidel Castro made his third trip to
Moscow in the summer of 1972.
Havana radio, monitored in Miami, said Brezhnev
was coming to Cuba "for an official, friendly visit"
at Castro's invitation.
The Russian's trip had been scheduled long
before the newest round of speculation over a
U.S.-Cuban thaw, which began after Cuba's
ambassador to Mexico remarked to newsmen that
Cuba would be willing to negotiate with Washington
if a U.S. economic blockade of the island was lifted.
Some foreign observers believe Russia would
welcome a Cuban-American arrangement and that
Brezhnev will push for this in his talks with Castro.
But officially, both Washington and Havana say
nothing has happened to change their positions.

Battle Rages In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government troops
struck at the center of the insurgent drive toward

The government move was an initial step toward
eliminating the almost daily artillery barrages
against the capital, which began Dec. 23, and so far
have killed 145 persons and wounded 354. The bulk
of the casualties have come in the past three days.

by the second quarter of the year unless the Arab
nations resume oil shipments.
"I believe the present situation clearly indicates
that in the second quarter we're going to be in a
posture where gas rationing may well be a reality,"
he said. "I don't think there's much doubt about it.
unless there are some developments overseas which
would indicate that we will get extra crude
material."
A vote on final passage of the Emergency Energy-
Act is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon in the
Senate. This is the bill giving Nixon discretionary
powers to deal with the energy crisis.
Britain May Shorten Work Week
LONDON — Lord Carrington, Britain's energy
minister, said yesterday a complete strike by the
nation's coal miners could reduce British industry to
a two-day work week.
"If the miners do decide to go for a strike, the
situation will be that we shall not be on a three-day
week but something much less," he said in a radio
interview.
Asked to explain what he meant, Carrington
said: "Less than a three-day week is obviously a 2 x /i
or a two-day week."
Anxiety over labor strife and threatened
industrial breakdown have already pushed public
attitudes to the point that army troops are reported
training with police in case of a peril to public
order.
Brezhnev To Arrive In Cuba
MIAMI, Fla. — Soviet Communist party boss
Leonid I. Brezhnev arrives in Havana this week amid
speculation about a possible renewal of relations
between the United States and Cuba.
Brezhnev's visit is the first by a top Kremlin
leader to the Caribbean island since Premier Alexei
N. Kosygin spent five days theryin October, 1971.
Prime Minister Fidel Castro made his third trip to
Moscow in the summer of 1972.
Havana radio, monitored in Miami, said Brezhnev
was coming to Cuba "for an official, friendly visit"
at Castro's invitation.
The Russian's trip had been scheduled long
before the newest round of speculation over a
U.S.-Cuban thaw, which began after Cuba's
ambassador to Mexico remarked to newsmen that
Cuba would be willing to negotiate with Washington
if a U.S. economic blockade of the island was lifted.
Some foreign observers believe Russia would
welcome a Cuban-American arrangement and that
Brezhnev will push for this in his talks with Castro.
But officially, both Washington and Havana say
nothing has happened to change their positions.

Battle Rages In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government troops
struck at the center of the insurgent drive toward
Phnom Penh yesterday, retaking a two-mile stretch
along the city's southern front, field reports said.
The government move was an initial step toward
eliminating the almost daily artillery barrages
against the capital, which began Dec. 23, and so far
have killed 145 persons and wounded 354. The bulk
of the casualties have come in the past three days.
Marijuana Petition Floundering
LOS ANGELES — Promoters hoping to place a
marijuana decriminalization petition on the
November ballot say their signature drive is lagging
in the facing of a Feb. 18 deadline.
Fran McDermott of the Marijuana Reform
League said during the weekend that only 175,000
of 325,504 necessary signatures have been obtained.
The drive is running about 150,000 signatures short
at this point, three months after petitions began
circulating, she said.
Tightening Of Bank Rules Urged
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve Board
urged Congress yesterday to strengthen its
anti-inflation powers by requiring about 5000 banks
to obey reserve rules on their checking accounts for
the first time.
If the board's sweeping proposal is adopted, it
could tell nonmember banks how much of the
estimated $50 billion deposited in their checking
accounts must be kept on hand as reserves.
The legislation would give the independent
central bank authority to set reserve amounts on
about 97 percent of demand deposits nationally. It
now has power over about 75 percent.
It is through this official tying up of cash that
the Federal Reserve can control the flow of money
to the economy and, to a large extent, the amount
of money banks have to lend to consumers.
