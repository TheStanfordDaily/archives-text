# Student Housing Proposals
## 
### 
Written proposals for new student housing
programs and changes in the present housing
configuration must be submitted to the Dean of
Student Affairs office (third floor, Old Union)
no later than Feb. 15.
The early deadline has been established so
that new housing alternatives can be included in
the guide to the 1974 spring housing draw.
Further information on procedures for
submitting proposals is available in the Dean of
Student Affairs office.
