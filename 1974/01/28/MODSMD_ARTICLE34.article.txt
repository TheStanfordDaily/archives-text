# Lost A Bike? Try The Police
## 
### 
If you lost a bicycle, you may find
it in a pen behind the Stanford Fire
Station, according to Jack Donals,
desk officer for the Stanford Police
Department.
Approximately 200 bikes, including
some 10-speeds, were impounded at
least nine months ago by County
sheriffs.
"The bikes were picked up on
campus because they had no licenses,"
says Donals.
To claim a bike, the owner must go
to the fire station, pick out his bike,
prove ownership, and license the bike.
To prove ownership, a person must
know the bike frame number, or "in
some instances, being able to open
bike locks will be enough."
All unclaimed bikes will be
removed by sheriffs sometime in
February, according to Donals. The
bikes will be taken to a "work farm"
where they will be checked and
repaired if necessary. They will then
be donated to children of welfare
recipients.
