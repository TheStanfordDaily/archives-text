# Some Area Gas Dealers To Join County Strike
## 
### WAYNE MILLER 
As of last Saturday, owners of
service stations near the University do
not expect to close down Feb. 1, the
day set by the National Service Station
Dealers Association (NSSDA) to begin
a Santa Clara County-wide strike.
But if the local NSSDA member
stations do lock their pumps, the
remaining open ones might respect the
strike, according to some Menlo Park
station managers. In addition, most
non-member stations sympathize with
the NSSDA cause.
The closest station — Campus Shell
on Serra Street — has no plans to shut
down, states manager Gary Andrews.
"I'm not a member of the NSSDA, but
I agree with everything they are
saying," he added.
Andrews, like other county
managers, complains that he is not
making a high enough profit margin.

"The government wants me to reduce
the cost at the pumps, and with the oil
companies raising their prices, some of
the money has to come from my
pocket," he explained. As of last
Saturday, his prices were the lowest of
any of the polled stations: 45 and 47
cents per gallon for "regular" and
"supreme."
However, according to an Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) report, Campus
Shell overcharged customers by
$2919. The IRS then ordered the
station to lower its gas prices to offset
the overcharging. The current prices at
the station reflect the imposed
rollback. According to Andrews, the
money will be refunded within two
months.
The maximum price that any dealer
can charge for gas is based on the
tabulation of the profit margin the
individual station had on May 15 of
last year, the wholesale price increase
allowed by the government, plus the
one-cent additional granted Jan. 1.
Ken Davis, president of the
NSSDA, does not expect strong gas
station support for the Feb. 1 strike
area dealers. "We're strong in San Jose,
though," he stated (Davis himself is a
Shell manager in San Jose). "We've
talked to dealers in San Mateo, and
they may go along with us," he noted.
"If they do, we expect the whole
peninsula to join the strike."
Those stations which do not belong
to the association may have to close
anyway, according to Davis.
"February's allocation of gas is about

75 percent of '72 — in other words,
half the gas we need to run the
stations," he said. "Either they join us
now, or at the end of the month when
they run out of gas."
Of the local managers interviewed,
the one at Stanford Texaco (on El
Camino) is the most involved in the
dealer's association. Though a member
of the NSSDA board of directors, he
speaks as an independent dealer. "I
don't see how government can step
into free enterprise and then expect it
to work. The strike itself is immaterial
— most dealers around here are going
to have to close down anyway because
they have no gas." His pumps read 49,
51, and 53 cents per gallon, prices
comparable to the other stations
polled.
Stanford Texaco's manager can
understand why one NSSDA board
member quit last week, who "wanted
to devote more time to his family and
business." The NSSDA meets four to
five times weekly. "There's inner
politics, to be sure," the manager
states. "But we're just getting together
— no group of this magnitude has ever
been started before," he notes.
An assistant manager at one Menlo
Park Standard station on El Camino
and Ravenswood expressed his doubt
that his station would close down
completely. "It's possible, though," he
said. "Since we're a company station,
what Standard dictates to us, we do.
The regional dealer for us and other
stations around here may want a
strike, or the company may want to
