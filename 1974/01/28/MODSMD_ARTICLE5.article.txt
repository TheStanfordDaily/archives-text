# Faculty-Staff Complex Debated
## Referendum On Project Planned 
### DENIS CUFF 
Students will vote within three
weeks on whether or not they support
the proposed construction of a
100-unit faculty-staff housing complex
on the site of the old Stanford
Elementary School (S.E.S.) and
Hurlburt House.
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend
has announced a public meeting on the
issue for this Thursday in Tresidder
Room 270-271 at 7:30 p.m. Friend
said that of the invitations sent, so far
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance, has
agreed to come.
Friend said that most of the 500
signatures needed to put the issue to a
referendum have been collected. The
ASSU Constitution requires that a
referendum come to a vote no less
than six days and no more than 15
days after the ASSU President receives
the petitions.
Friend Still Cautious
Friend said he was pleased by
student reactions and interest in the
issue, but he was cautious about the
chances of halting construction of the
complex.
"There's no reason to say it can't
happen, but it's foolishness to say it's
probable," Friend said.
He said there is another purpose in
holding the referendum besides trying
to get the University to reconsider its
plans. "It's also to educate students
about the way University decisions are
made."
University Planning Criticized
Friend criticized the University's
planning process for its lack of student
input and lack of consideration for
student needs. Specifically, he referred
to a lack of consideration for

"friction" between emeriti and
students (for example, faculty
complaining about students' noise)
and a lack of consideration for
architecture and the physical
appearance of the Row.
"I would like the Planning Office to
think they're working for students,"
Friend said. "It's not premeditated,
but they just don't think of things
sometimes."
Friend said he would like to see
institutionalized steps to bring more
student input into planning decisions.
Building plans are in progress for many
years before students find out about
them, he contended.
Agenda Not Known
Friend, one of three student
members of the Trustee Land and

Building Committee, which approved
the S.E.S. site at its January 8
meeting, said he was surprised by the
speed of his committee's decision.
None of the student members were
present at that meeting.
Friend said he couldn't have known
what was on the agenda because the
material for the meeting was mailed
over Christmas vacation to his
Stanford address. He said that when
the housing complex was brought up
at a previous meeting, the discussion
of sites was very tentative.
Augsburger Disagrees
Augsburger disagreed sharply with
Friend. He said the student committee
members knew when the Jan. 8
meeting was and they should have
been there. In the earlier meeting in

which the housing complex was
discussed, it was "very clear" the
group was strongly considering the
S.E.S. location as the favored site, he
said.
Augsburger said the referendum
was "unfortunate" and student input
was coming "too late." "The
referendum is subverting a process that
was not utilized," he said. The
channels for student input were there;
they just weren't used, Augsburger
said.
Asked if he thought the University
could change its plans at this time,
Augsburger replied, "I rather doubt it.
It's come pretty far down the line."
The project has been studied and
planned for several years, he added.
