# Book Buyers Change Habits; Sales Reflect New Interests
## 
### LAURIE LUCAS 
If the books that young people are buying reflect the
condition of society, then the problems of the 1960s have
been solved.
Or perhaps the problems have just begun.
A survey of some area bookstores revealed that, the
women's movement notwithstanding, young people seem
concerned more with plants than politics, serenity than
society. Norman Mailer is the prisoner of the back shelves,
and Eldridge Cleaver is on ice.
Most surprising however, is the waning enthusiasm for
ecology and environmental books. "The kids today are
more interested in eliminating inner pollution," said Nick
Simon, veteran buyer at Kepler's Bookstore since 1959.
Offering what Simon called "personal cleansing," the
big-selling books deal with transactional analysis and
self-help.
Stalwarts of the paperback trade are such psychological
booster shots as I'm OK, You're OK, How To Be Your
Own Best Friend, Winning With People, and Born To Win,
said Simon.
Sales suggest that students have resigned themselves to
coping with the same society they once tried to change.
Book interests are more limited to personal
preoccupations, as opposed to the broad-based activist
concerns of five years ago.
Nowadays a student finds he can master almost
everything through instructional books — from growing
house plants to giving a massage.
At the Stanford Bookstore, readers are supplementing
their libraries with House Plants For The Purple Thumb,
Mother Earth — Hassle Free Indoor Plant Book and
Handmade Houses: A Guide To Woodbutchery.
Science fiction is still popular, but it has been
buttressed in recent months by the popularization of the
occult. Blatty's The Exorcist, and Von Dahniken's
Chariots Of The Gods are selling on campus at the rate of
100 copies a month.
Women's literature has been the only survivor of the
sixties, although it exhibits the same trend away from
political consciousness to self-discovery. The New
Woman's Survival Catalog and Our Bodies Ourselves have
replaced The Female Eunuch and The Feminine Mystique
as big sellers.


...From Politics to Plants?
