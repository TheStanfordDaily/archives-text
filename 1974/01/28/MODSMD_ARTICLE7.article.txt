# Where's Our Peace?
## Killing Continues 
### 
Chris H. Gray

Last week was the first anniversary
of the signing of the Peace Agreement
in Vietnam. Since the signing, for
which Le Doc Tho and Henry-
Kissinger were awarded Nobel peace
prizes, more than 50,000 people have
been killed.
More than 80 percent of the South
Vietnamese budget is direct American
aid. South Vietnam is not an
independent nation. Exactly what it is
might be difficult to decide though I
might seriously suggest that it is just
another department of the United
States government.
While the 50,000 dead and the
intimate United States involvement in
their deaths is obviously the main
issue, there are a number of other facts
that warrant attention. Repression
continues in Vietnam as before. There
are an estimated 200,000 political
prisoners in South Vietnamese jails.
The rate of political arrests intensified
after the Peace Agreement was signed.
Torture continues in Vietnam as
before. (As it does in Brazil, Greece,
and Chili — for an interesting article
on America's exportation of new
torture technology see the Sept. issue
of Science Digest.) The use of tiger
cages, prison islands, indefinite
detention, military trials, pure torture,
and execution continues as it has since
Diem's last years.
The two billion dollars that we have
given to South Vietnam since the
"peace" might have been better spent.
It is interesting that 1.6 billion went
either to the military or the police
while .4 went to heal the scars of a
nation torn by more bombs than any
other in man's history. Our bombs. It
is very American to just pay the bills
for our half of the war and hope it all
becomes politically unimportant
before we lose it.

There has been continual warfare in
Vietnam since 1939. That is 35 years.
The nationalists, in one form or
another, have won every section of
this long way including quite real
defeats of the French and the South
Vietnamese armies under Diem. They
have fought Japanese, Nationalist
Chinese, Thais, Cambodians,
Australians, New Zealanders, a large
number of Americans, and other
Vietnamese. I am not particularly
sympathetic to the Communist regime
which has led this struggle since the
early 19405. However, in light of the
alternatives, in light of its inevitable
victory and in light of the dead and
dying, I can only hope for an early
collapse of Thieu's dictatorship.
What to do? Ah, now there's a
problem. The causal relationship
between the Vietnam protests of
yesterday and our present "honorable
peace" is not even convincing. Without
the draft and American casualty lists,
many people have more difficulty
confronting the war's reality.
How does one confront the reality
of 50,000 dead people? I don't even
know the names of 50,000 people. 1
don't think I know more than a
hundred people intimately.
Everyone I know and love could die
in the course of a week's "peace" in
Vietnam. Of course, my friends and
loved ones are not in Vietnam. But,
someone's are.
As far as I know, there will be no
marches here at Stanford to protest
the continued dying. There will be no
rallies to cry out the injustices to the
idle sky at White Plaza. We at
Columbae are in mourning. There will
be signs of mourning. If you too are in
mourning, join us.

which Le Doc Tho and Henry-
Kissinger were awarded Nobel peace
prizes, more than 50,000 people have
been killed.
More than 80 percent of the South
Vietnamese budget is direct American
aid. South Vietnam is not an
independent nation. Exactly what it is
might be difficult to decide though I
might seriously suggest that it is just
another department of the United
States government.
While the 50,000 dead and the
intimate United States involvement in
their deaths is obviously the main
issue, there are a number of other facts
that warrant attention. Repression
continues in Vietnam as before. There
are an estimated 200,000 political
prisoners in South Vietnamese jails.
The rate of political arrests intensified
after the Peace Agreement was signed.
Torture continues in Vietnam as
before. (As it does in Brazil, Greece,
and Chili — for an interesting article
on America's exportation of new
torture technology see the Sept. issue
of Science Digest.) The use of tiger
cages, prison islands, indefinite
detention, military trials, pure torture,
and execution continues as it has since
Diem's last years.
The two billion dollars that we have
given to South Vietnam since the
"peace" might have been better spent.
It is interesting that 1.6 billion went
either to the military or the police
while .4 went to heal the scars of a
nation torn by more bombs than any
other in man's history. Our bombs. It
is very American to just pay the bills
for our half of the war and hope it all
becomes politically unimportant
before we lose it.

There has been continual warfare in
Vietnam since 1939. That is 35 years.
The nationalists, in one form or
another, have won every section of
this long way including quite real
defeats of the French and the South
Vietnamese armies under Diem. They
have fought Japanese, Nationalist
Chinese, Thais, Cambodians,
Australians, New Zealanders, a large
number of Americans, and other
Vietnamese. I am not particularly
sympathetic to the Communist regime
which has led this struggle since the
early 19405. However, in light of the
alternatives, in light of its inevitable
victory and in light of the dead and
dying, I can only hope for an early
collapse of Thieu's dictatorship.
What to do? Ah, now there's a
problem. The causal relationship
between the Vietnam protests of
yesterday and our present "honorable
peace" is not even convincing. Without
the draft and American casualty lists,
many people have more difficulty
confronting the war's reality.
How does one confront the reality
of 50,000 dead people? I don't even
know the names of 50,000 people. 1
don't think I know more than a
hundred people intimately.
Everyone I know and love could die
in the course of a week's "peace" in
Vietnam. Of course, my friends and
loved ones are not in Vietnam. But,
someone's are.
As far as I know, there will be no
marches here at Stanford to protest
the continued dying. There will be no
rallies to cry out the injustices to the
idle sky at White Plaza. We at
Columbae are in mourning. There will
be signs of mourning. If you too are in
mourning, join us.
