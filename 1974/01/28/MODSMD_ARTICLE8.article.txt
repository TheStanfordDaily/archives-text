KQED Newsroom
Editor:
The discussion of TV news "happy
talk" in the Jan. 16 Daily neglected to
mention KQED's Newsroom as an
alternative to sugar-coated, banal news
coverage.
Newsroom is a one hour (no
commercials) program broadcast on
Channel 9 weekdays at 7 p.m. and
repeated (videotape) at 11 p.m. The
format of Newsroom is unique, with
each story being presented in the
studio by the reporter who covered it
in the field, instead of being read by
an anchorman. After the presentation
of each story, there is an opportunity
for discussion among all of the
reporters. These discussions are often
quite helpful, since they bring up
questions that might have also crossed
the viewer's mind. In addition, on
Thursday nights, there is an
opportunity for viewers to phone in
their own questions on the news.
The only bay area program that
gives the weather the coverage it
deserves is Newsroom. The weather
coverage consists of about 30 seconds
of interviews with bay area people on
their opinion of the current weather,
followed by 10 seconds of a chart
describing the next day's weather as
"fair, patchy fog in the morning" or
some equally concise description of
the never-startling bay area weather.
The total time for this coverage is less
than it takes Pete Giddings to point
out the one or two degree differences
in the predicted temperatures for
fifteen bay area regions.
It is not surprising that Newsroom
was neglected from the Daily article. A
bay area resident for over three years,
I only discovered the program last year
myself. However, I can assure those
who are disgusted with "happy news"
that they will receive a pleasant
surprise by tuning in to Channel 9.

The POW/MIA League of Santa
Clara County from its inception three
years ago has had the following two
objectives:
(1) The release of all American
Prisoners of War in Southeast Asia;
(2) The complete accounting of all
Americans Missing in Action in
Southeast Asia.
Since the signing of the Paris Peace
Agreement on Jan. 27, 1973, only the
first of the above objectives has been
satisfactorily accomplished. Many
factors such as Watergate, the energy
crisis, Mideast crisis, and general
apathy of the public as a result of the
complete withdrawal from Southeast
Asia have precluded any viable
solution or concern for the completion
of the secondary goal.

Because of this apathy and lack of
support, it has become necessary for
the League to close its office effective
January 31, 1974. It is unfortunate
that such an action has become
necessary. It appears that the slogan
"The Forgotten Americans" is the
most descriptive phrase to express the
tragedy that has befallen these missing
men. Equally disturbing is the despair
felt by the families, knowing that it is
inevitable that they will never know
the fate of their loved ones.
It is with deep regret that the
League takes this action. However, as a
nonpolitical organization, it has ceased
to be functional.
The League's heartfelt appreciation
is extended to everyone in the Santa
Clara valley who has shared the
concern and given their support over
the last three years. We have done all
we can.

Unfounded Allegations
Editor:
Recent writers have taken
strenuous objection to Claire Spiegel's
article on Chang Chung-Keui. But they
advanced their objections by way of
unfounded allegations — and they
facilely employed the scurrilous charge
that Spiegel is a racist.
First, from direct personal
knowledge I know specifically that
Spiegel is not a racist. A racist is
someone who believes that persons
belonging to certain races are not
entitled to full rights and who doesn't
consider a person according to his
individual merit. Not only is Spiegel
not a racist, but her own vocal
political interest in women's rights
reflects a concern for individual
achievement and the merit standard.
Secondly, some thought that the
story was a product of subconscious
racism. When one talks about
subconscious racism, one means that
the habitual patterns of
unpremeditated actions show that the
person has the same views as a
conscious racist. But close
examination of Spiegel's story, alert to
the nuances of her writing, shows that
her focus is on the uniqueness of
Chang's character. Looking at the
story objectively, it certainly does not
promote the doctrine of racism.
Thirdly, some people made what
seemed to be groundless complaints
about the facts in Spiegel's story. No
one wrote in to say that he personally
had investigated whether Chang claims
to live on fifteen cents a day or is
worried about opium smoking by
relatives. It is only on the basis of new
evidence of this sort that valid
objections could be raised.

Southeast Asia.
Since the signing of the Paris Peace
Agreement on Jan. 27, 1973, only the
first of the above objectives has been
satisfactorily accomplished. Many
factors such as Watergate, the energy
crisis, Mideast crisis, and general
apathy of the public as a result of the
complete withdrawal from Southeast
Asia have precluded any viable
solution or concern for the completion
of the secondary goal.

Because of this apathy and lack of
support, it has become necessary for
the League to close its office effective
January 31, 1974. It is unfortunate
that such an action has become
necessary. It appears that the slogan
"The Forgotten Americans" is the
most descriptive phrase to express the
tragedy that has befallen these missing
men. Equally disturbing is the despair
felt by the families, knowing that it is
inevitable that they will never know
the fate of their loved ones.
It is with deep regret that the
League takes this action. However, as a
nonpolitical organization, it has ceased
to be functional.
The League's heartfelt appreciation
is extended to everyone in the Santa
Clara valley who has shared the
concern and given their support over
the last three years. We have done all
we can.

Unfounded Allegations
Editor:
Recent writers have taken
strenuous objection to Claire Spiegel's
article on Chang Chung-Keui. But they
advanced their objections by way of
unfounded allegations — and they
facilely employed the scurrilous charge
that Spiegel is a racist.
First, from direct personal
knowledge I know specifically that
Spiegel is not a racist. A racist is
someone who believes that persons
belonging to certain races are not
entitled to full rights and who doesn't
consider a person according to his
individual merit. Not only is Spiegel
not a racist, but her own vocal
political interest in women's rights
reflects a concern for individual
achievement and the merit standard.
Secondly, some thought that the
story was a product of subconscious
racism. When one talks about
subconscious racism, one means that
the habitual patterns of
unpremeditated actions show that the
person has the same views as a
conscious racist. But close
examination of Spiegel's story, alert to
the nuances of her writing, shows that
her focus is on the uniqueness of
Chang's character. Looking at the
story objectively, it certainly does not
promote the doctrine of racism.
Thirdly, some people made what
seemed to be groundless complaints
about the facts in Spiegel's story. No
one wrote in to say that he personally
had investigated whether Chang claims
to live on fifteen cents a day or is
worried about opium smoking by
relatives. It is only on the basis of new
evidence of this sort that valid
objections could be raised.

The discussion of TV news "happy
talk" in the Jan. 16 Daily neglected to
mention KQED's Newsroom as an
alternative to sugar-coated, banal news
coverage.
Newsroom is a one hour (no
commercials) program broadcast on
Channel 9 weekdays at 7 p.m. and
repeated (videotape) at 11 p.m. The
format of Newsroom is unique, with
each story being presented in the
studio by the reporter who covered it
in the field, instead of being read by
an anchorman. After the presentation
of each story, there is an opportunity
for discussion among all of the
reporters. These discussions are often
quite helpful, since they bring up
questions that might have also crossed
the viewer's mind. In addition, on
Thursday nights, there is an
opportunity for viewers to phone in
their own questions on the news.
The only bay area program that
gives the weather the coverage it
deserves is Newsroom. The weather
coverage consists of about 30 seconds
of interviews with bay area people on
their opinion of the current weather,
followed by 10 seconds of a chart
describing the next day's weather as
"fair, patchy fog in the morning" or
some equally concise description of
the never-startling bay area weather.
The total time for this coverage is less
than it takes Pete Giddings to point
out the one or two degree differences
in the predicted temperatures for
fifteen bay area regions.
It is not surprising that Newsroom
was neglected from the Daily article. A
bay area resident for over three years,
I only discovered the program last year
myself. However, I can assure those
who are disgusted with "happy news"
that they will receive a pleasant
surprise by tuning in to Channel 9.

racism. When one talks about
subconscious racism, one means that
the habitual patterns of
unpremeditated actions show that the
person has the same views as a
conscious racist. But close
examination of Spiegel's story, alert to
the nuances of her writing, shows that
her focus is on the uniqueness of
Chang's character. Looking at the
story objectively, it certainly does not
promote the doctrine of racism.
Thirdly, some people made what
seemed to be groundless complaints
about the facts in Spiegel's story. No
one wrote in to say that he personally
had investigated whether Chang claims
to live on fifteen cents a day or is
worried about opium smoking by
relatives. It is only on the basis of new
evidence of this sort that valid
objections could be raised.

KQED Newsroom
Editor:
The discussion of TV news "happy
talk" in the Jan. 16 Daily neglected to
mention KQED's Newsroom as an
alternative to sugar-coated, banal news
coverage.
Newsroom is a one hour (no
commercials) program broadcast on
Channel 9 weekdays at 7 p.m. and
repeated (videotape) at 11 p.m. The
format of Newsroom is unique, with
each story being presented in the
studio by the reporter who covered it
in the field, instead of being read by
an anchorman. After the presentation
of each story, there is an opportunity
for discussion among all of the
reporters. These discussions are often
quite helpful, since they bring up
questions that might have also crossed
the viewer's mind. In addition, on
Thursday nights, there is an
opportunity for viewers to phone in
their own questions on the news.
The only bay area program that
gives the weather the coverage it
deserves is Newsroom. The weather
coverage consists of about 30 seconds
of interviews with bay area people on
their opinion of the current weather,
followed by 10 seconds of a chart
describing the next day's weather as
"fair, patchy fog in the morning" or
some equally concise description of
the never-startling bay area weather.
The total time for this coverage is less
than it takes Pete Giddings to point
out the one or two degree differences
in the predicted temperatures for
fifteen bay area regions.
It is not surprising that Newsroom
was neglected from the Daily article. A
bay area resident for over three years,
I only discovered the program last year
myself. However, I can assure those
who are disgusted with "happy news"
that they will receive a pleasant
surprise by tuning in to Channel 9.

POW/MIA Chapter Closes
Editor:
The POW/MIA League of Santa
Clara County from its inception three
years ago has had the following two
objectives:
(1) The release of all American
Prisoners of War in Southeast Asia;
(2) The complete accounting of all
Americans Missing in Action in
Southeast Asia.
Since the signing of the Paris Peace
Agreement on Jan. 27, 1973, only the
first of the above objectives has been
satisfactorily accomplished. Many
factors such as Watergate, the energy
crisis, Mideast crisis, and general
apathy of the public as a result of the
complete withdrawal from Southeast
Asia have precluded any viable
solution or concern for the completion
of the secondary goal.

Because of this apathy and lack of
support, it has become necessary for
the League to close its office effective
January 31, 1974. It is unfortunate
that such an action has become
necessary. It appears that the slogan
"The Forgotten Americans" is the
most descriptive phrase to express the
tragedy that has befallen these missing
men. Equally disturbing is the despair
felt by the families, knowing that it is
inevitable that they will never know
the fate of their loved ones.
It is with deep regret that the
League takes this action. However, as a
nonpolitical organization, it has ceased
to be functional.
The League's heartfelt appreciation
is extended to everyone in the Santa
Clara valley who has shared the
concern and given their support over
the last three years. We have done all
we can.

Unfounded Allegations
Editor:
Recent writers have taken
strenuous objection to Claire Spiegel's
article on Chang Chung-Keui. But they
advanced their objections by way of
unfounded allegations — and they
facilely employed the scurrilous charge
that Spiegel is a racist.
First, from direct personal
knowledge I know specifically that
Spiegel is not a racist. A racist is
someone who believes that persons
belonging to certain races are not
entitled to full rights and who doesn't
consider a person according to his
individual merit. Not only is Spiegel
not a racist, but her own vocal
political interest in women's rights
reflects a concern for individual
achievement and the merit standard.
Secondly, some thought that the
story was a product of subconscious
racism. When one talks about
subconscious racism, one means that
the habitual patterns of
unpremeditated actions show that the
