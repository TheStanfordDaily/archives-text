Euromed will assist qualified Amer
ican students in gaining admission

language course, mandatory for all
students. Five hours daily. 5 days per
week (12 16 weeks) the course is
given in the country where the student
will attend medical school
In addition, Euromed provides stu
dents with a 12 week intensive cul
tural orientation program, with
American students now studying medi
cine in that particular country serving
as counselors

enrolled in an American university are
eligible to participate in the Euromed
