# Endowment Shortage Forces Tuition Increases
## 
### TERRY ANZUR First Of Three Parts 
"During the past years we have
been able to offset rising costs by
raising tuition . . . but we may be close
to the resistance level where many
parents and their children will simply
ask whether it is worth it."
Robert Augsburger, University
vice-president for business and finance,
used these words when assessing
Stanford's financial condition in
September, 1971. More than two years
and two tuition increases later,
Augsburger's analysis remains
painfully relevant: "We're not in
financial trouble," he said, "but we're
close to it."
In the 70s, Stanford and other
private institutions face the end of a
boom in federal and outside gift
support that catalyzed rapid expansion
of higher education during the 50s and
60s. During fall quarter alone,
government research contracts and
awards to Stanford fell 13 percent.
Figures released earlier this month
by Vice-Provost William F. Massey
show a $1.5 million dollar drop in the
cumulative total of federal research
support at Stanford of $1.5 million for
the 12-month period ending last Dec.
1.
Against a backdrop of spiralling
educational costs and wavering federal
support, the Daily examines various
aspects of Stanford's fund-raising and
budgetary policies in this three part

series.
Tomorrow's segment will focus on
the outlook for corporate
philantrophy. Part three will examine
the danger that increasing dependence
on gift support might influence the
complexion and direction of
Stanford's future growth.
As the public and private
benefactors of higher education
reevaluate their rationales for gift
support, tuition increases strain the
resources of financial aid programs and
student pocketbooks.
Underendowed
Part of the reason that a Stanford
education is dangerously overpriced
with respect to all but the wealthiest
students is that the University is
seriously underendowed.
The Stanfords recognized the
importance of endowment when they
founded the University in 1891.
Before 1920, students here paid no
tuition. Income from the $21 million
founding grant — the largest
endowment for any private institution
at that time — covered nearly all
educational costs.
Today, Stanford's $346 million
endowment supports less than 20
percent of the educational budget.
"We've gotten bigger and better
without a commensurate increase in
endowment," Massey points out.
"Quality is expensive."
Students pay 43 percent of the cost
of quality education in tuition and

fees. A 7.6 percent tuition increase
approved by the Board of Trustees
Nov. 13 sets tuition for 1974-75 at
$3375 — up $240 from this year's
$3135 rate.
Comparison
Although the 1974-75 tuition
figure is in the same ballpark with that
of other major private universities,
Stanford's endowment total isn't even
in the same league with the Ivies, Cal
Tech or MIT. "Harvard has four times
our endowment, but we're not four
times worse educationally than
Harvard," notes Ed Shaw, executive
assistant to the provost.
A survey by the American Alumni
Council in 1971 revealed that Cal Tech
had $80,000 of endowment per
student, Harvard about $75,000, and
Stanford about $25,000. If Stanford
had as much endowment as Cal Tech
or Harvard "we'd be able to do what

we d like to do without financial
pressures," Massey says.
How are tuition increases and the
endowment shortage related? Massey,
a professor of business administration,
explains: "We are unable to get along
without a tuition increase because
University costs depend so much on
wages and salaries. We would need a
large enough endowment to cover cost
inflation, and it's unlikely we'll ever
have that much.
"And unless we get to that point
we will have to continue to raise
tuition," Massey concludes. "But I
don't see it rising faster than it has in
the recent past."
Eight Percent Up
For the past 10 years, tuition has
increased an average of eight percent
each year. If that trend continues,
tuition would reach the $4000 mark

before the current freshman class
graduates.
Recent studies show that about
one-fourth of those admitted to
Stanford chose to attend other
universities for financial reasons.
According to a University fund-raising
publication one of every three tuition
dollars is offset by scholarship aid. As
more Stanford students get caught in
the middle income squeeze, an
increasing number of requests for
financial aid compounds the need for a
broader endowment base.
Thus, it is no accident that adding
$125 million to endowment is the
largest goal in the Campaign for
Stanford — a five-year $300 million
fund-raising drive launched in April,
1972. The campaign, the largest single
fund-raising effort ever undertaken by
a University, has now reached 40

percent of its endowment goal.
According to the most recent estimate
endowment gifts and pledges in the
campaign so far total $49.6 million.
The components of the campaign
goal reflect the role of endowment
funds in maintaining the essentials of
the university: $42 million for 70
endowed professorships; $35 million
for student financial aid; $30 million
to meet general university expenses
with unrestricted funds; $10 million
for library book purchase; and $8
million in seed money for promising
new projects.
'Highest Priority'
Massey stresses that the dramatic
increase in endowment is needed
simply to maintain current university
facilities and programs. "Endowment
to finance ongoing operations is our
