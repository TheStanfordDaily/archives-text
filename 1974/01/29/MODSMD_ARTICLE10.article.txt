# Union Claims Current Standards' Denied
## Employees Protest University Negotiations 
### 
Tim Knaak

Last June United Stanford
Employees (USE) won recognition in
an NLRB election as the collective
bargaining agent for the "technical,
maintenance and service" employees
of Stanford University. Then why
should USE be calling a "strike
workshop" already? A strike is
nothing to consider lightly, so let me
say that we are v not calling a strike at
this time and hope we do not have to.
But we must be prepared for one if
negotiations continue as they have up
to now.
Too often negotiations between an
employer and a union drag on in an
unbending, even if polite, search for
concessions, tit-for-tat, irrespective of
establishing right relations between
management and workers. This
exchange becomes absurd if the
employer insists on making the union
fight for rights previously granted,
which is precisely what Stanford is
doing. University negotiators refuse
the inclusion of a "maintenance of
current standards" clause.
The main concession they seek,
intent on keeping the status quo
unruffled despite inequalities, is to
bind the union's hands by outlawing
all public dissent from the level of a
strike to a mere informational picket
by any employee. The significance of
this point must be made clear. It may
be true that some unions have abused
the right of protest and that outlawing
the destruction of property and
endangering of others should be
considered. But the University
proposal goes further than this in three
ways.
First, they want to outlaw
picketing. They have told our
negotiators that someone waylaying
passers-by and leafletting is not
objectionable, but a picket is. A picket
is less of an imposition and more
economical, but it seems that the
University is concerned with the easy
visibility of the picket's message.
Bureaucracies, whether Stanford's the
United States' or the Soviet Union's,
do not like public criticism, but this
gives them no right to stifle it or keep
it quiet, or to do their business in
secret from those they claim to serve.
Exposure and correct response to
dissent is part of management's job.
Imposition of Will
Secondly, the University seeks to
make the union responsible for
individual and small group actions. As
the expression of the workers'
democratic desires, the union has a
collective responsibility. But no
majority, or bureaucracy, should
impose its will on the minority or limit
individual dissent no matter how high
its ideals and intentions. Moreover,
while Stanford has been quick in the
game or bargaining to point out that
not all unit workers are in the union
yet, they ignore this very fact in
attempting to make the union
responsible even for those who do not
participate in it.
Lastly, the University proposes to
take any disciplinary action it pleases,
including discharge, with no
arbitration possible 011 that action
itself, if it can only show "reasonable
cause to believe," not proof, that
someone "directly or indirectly"
engaged in the onerous activity of
picketing (or other more questionable
activities.)
Stanford has asked for our trust in
its "good faith" on these matters, as if
good intentions could make up for
wrong actions. Like some observers of
national woes, it seems the University
is more concerned with restoring
confidence in established procedures
and the appearance of credibility than
with taking those right actions from
which well-founded credibility would
follow without the public relations

effort.
When I became a Stanford
employee this summer, the speaker at
orientation explained that Stanford
pays the median of Bay Area wage
scales in each classification. Union
figures say Stanford wages average 33
percent below the median. Stanford
has claimed in this newspaper that it is
offering an average 6V2 to 7 percent
wage increase. This is true but sly. The
proposed costof-Jiving increase is only
4 to 5 percent this year and 3 to 4
percent in the two following years.
The difference is accounted for by
expected "step increases." Actually
employees receive below the supposed
Bay Area standard by a series of either
3 or 4 steps of 5 percent each for the
two and a half years or longer it takes
to reach the "standard." Those at the
top receive only the cost-of-living
increase.
Is this fair in view of the actual

inflation of the past year (officially
8.8 percent? How can we say what
inflation will be in the next two years?
Wage earners should not be forced to
bear the brunt of payment for an
inflation caused not by themselves,
but by run-away profits and military
expenditures. Stanford might also
explain why its proposed wage
increases for lower paid employees are
less than for higher paid ones.
Some people talk about a new age
of humanism, but it seems Stanford
would rather be a follower than a
leader in social justice. Why is a
renowned institute of "higher
learning" not in the forefront passing
beyond the polarization of fights for
concessions to the higher
consciousness of active social concern?
Of course Stanford cannot become a
one-company welfare state, but just
what can it do, as the eightieth largest
U.S. corporation, to provide a model

of a fair employer, open to suggestion
and even dissent?
How do the students feel about
these issues, or the faculty or even thÂ£
administration, from the lowest
supervisor to President Lyman
himself? And what of the Stanford
workers not in the bargaining unit, or
those in it who yet stand aloof from
joining in union work? These people
will receive the same deal as the union
in the end. I know some of the people
in all of these groups are willing to
support the reasonable demands of the
workers. Let us hear from you; let the
University hear from you. Our
meetings are not secret and we will be.
glad to see you at the Strike
Workshop, Saturday, Feb. 2 at 1 p.m.'
in Bishop Auditorium.
