# Greater Sensitivity Needed
## Asian Americans: Silent No More 
### 
Doug Chan

Mr. Stephen M. Lazarus' contention
that Mike Hsu's and Karen Chang's
article represents "over-sensitivity"
raises a fundamental question
surrounding Ms. Claire Spiegel's article
on Chang Chung-Kuei.
What constitutes an ethnic
minority's sensitivity toward its
representation in the media and
specifically, the nature of the
American media's portrayal of Asian
Americans? The issues are doubly
complicated by fact that the post
treatment of non-white peoples in the
newspapers has been particularly
vicious in American history. Until
recently, Asian Americans have often
chosen to remain silent regarding these
matters.
In the case of Asian Americans one
need not read back to old copies of
the nineteenth-century newspaper,
Daily Alta California, to discover racial
insults and abuse to which Ms.
Speigel's article pales in comparison.
Indeed, it was a scant thirty years
ago when a prestige publication such
as Time could make references to
those "yellow bastards" with
impunity. It was only seven months
ago that California's attorney-general,
Evelle J. Younger, authorized the
distribution of the Criminal
Intelligence Bulletin entitled: "Triad:
Mafia of the Far East." (I do not wish
to go into a discussion of this. Other
Chinese civil-rights groups have
extensively refuted this irresponsible
document which links tongs, Red
Guards, family associations, and
Hong-Kong immigrants to
heroin-smuggling rings in the U.S. I
will add that Younger has, since,
publicly retracted this bulletin).
The aforementioned tract was
published only last July and probably
would have been widely circulated to
other parts of the nation had not such
strong objections been raised by
American Chinese.
The recent example of "Triad:
Mafia of the Far East" brings us back
to the article on Mr. Chang because it
is, in microcosm, a variation on the
same theme.
While I was not offended so much
by the reporting of Mr. Chang's
individual lifestyle, per se, I did have a
strong concern for Ms. Spiegel's
seemingly cavalier allusions to Chinese
and things Chinese.
Evidently, the staff of Junipero
House, Mike Hsu and Karen Chang,
concurred in their detection of a lack

of sensitivity towards Mr. Chang's
Chinese identity, which dangerously
reinforced many of the Asian
stereotypes still prevalent in the
nation.
You see Mr. Lazarus, racial
stereotypes are not-so-funny things
and the psychological and cultural
subjugation of the Asian American
stands out as white racism's only
success. As one group of Asian
Americans have written:
"The general function of any racial
stereotype is to establish and
preserve order between different
elements of society ... (and)
enforce white supremacy with a
minimum of effort, attention, and
expense. The ideal racial stereotype
is a low-maintenance engine of
white supremacy whose efficiency
increases with age, as it becomes
"authenticated" and "historically
verified." The stereotype operates
as a model of behavior. It
conditions mass society's
perceptions and expectations ... to
accept the given minority only
within the bounds of the
stereotype. ..

This is what I meant when I said,
"You swallowed Charlie Chan...lt*
has all bee internalized. Indeed,
acceptance of Mr. Chang as a man was
based, perhaps unconsciously, on a;
great many of these stereotypes, anct
the article by Hsu and Chang
many of them out.
Try to understand, Mr.
when Asian Americans voices speak
out, many for their first time. It is our
silence that has probably done more ta
help those who would deny the role:
Asians have played in building this
state, this University; who would
rather not see the full participation of
Asian Americans in this country's
economic, political, social, and
cultural life.
In conclusion, rather than resorting
to defensive trivialities such as =
charging "over-sensitivity," if there is
such a thing in this country, propose a
greater, more complete sensitivity. Mr.'~~

issue at stake, but clearly the images of

Mr. Stephen M. Lazarus' contention
that Mike Hsu's and Karen Chang's
article represents "over-sensitivity"
raises a fundamental question
surrounding Ms. Claire Spiegel's article
on Chang Chung-Kuei.
What constitutes an ethnic
minority's sensitivity toward its
representation in the media and
specifically, the nature of the
American media's portrayal of Asian
Americans? The issues are doubly
complicated by fact that the post
treatment of non-white peoples in the
newspapers has been particularly
vicious in American history. Until
recently, Asian Americans have often
chosen to remain silent regarding these
matters.
In the case of Asian Americans one
need not read back to old copies of
the nineteenth-century newspaper,
Daily Alta California, to discover racial
insults and abuse to which Ms.
Speigel's article pales in comparison.
Indeed, it was a scant thirty years
ago when a prestige publication such
as Time could make references to
those "yellow bastards" with
impunity. It was only seven months
ago that California's attorney-general,
Evelle J. Younger, authorized the
distribution of the Criminal
Intelligence Bulletin entitled: "Triad:
Mafia of the Far East." (I do not wish
to go into a discussion of this. Other
Chinese civil-rights groups have
extensively refuted this irresponsible
document which links tongs, Red
Guards, family associations, and
Hong-Kong immigrants to
heroin-smuggling rings in the U.S. I
will add that Younger has, since,
publicly retracted this bulletin).
The aforementioned tract was
published only last July and probably
would have been widely circulated to
other parts of the nation had not such
strong objections been raised by
American Chinese.
The recent example of "Triad:
Mafia of the Far East" brings us back
to the article on Mr. Chang because it
is, in microcosm, a variation on the
same theme.
While I was not offended so much
by the reporting of Mr. Chang's
individual lifestyle, per se, I did have a
strong concern for Ms. Spiegel's
seemingly cavalier allusions to Chinese
and things Chinese.
Evidently, the staff of Junipero
House, Mike Hsu and Karen Chang,
concurred in their detection of a lack

of sensitivity towards Mr. Chang's
Chinese identity, which dangerously
reinforced many of the Asian
stereotypes still prevalent in the
nation.
You see Mr. Lazarus, racial
stereotypes are not-so-funny things
and the psychological and cultural
subjugation of the Asian American
stands out as white racism's only
success. As one group of Asian
Americans have written:
"The general function of any racial
stereotype is to establish and
preserve order between different
elements of society ... (and)
enforce white supremacy with a
minimum of effort, attention, and
expense. The ideal racial stereotype
is a low-maintenance engine of
white supremacy whose efficiency
increases with age, as it becomes
