# Police Urge Bicycle Safety
## 
### JIM BABBITT 
Present bicycling laws "will
eventually be enforced more
greatly than they are now"
according to Officer Jack Donals
of the Stanford Police Services
Department, but no bike safety
crackdown is forseeable "in the
near future."
However, the officers will be
"more aware of moving violations
than they have been in the past,"
Donals added. "The laws are for
the bicyclists' own safety, and a
rider that breaks them is taking
his own life in his hands."
Robert M. Steele, an 18 year
old freshman, was killed last June
5 when the bicycle he was riding
collided with another bike on
Escondido Road after midnight.
Neither bicycle had a light.
That incident "made the
students more aware" of bike
safety, explained Donalds, "but
now it's been completely
forgotten. They [the bike riders]
have reverted back to
carelessness."

Capt. Frank Benaderet said
that "it [the enforcement of
regulations] is up to the
individual beat officer,"and that
no major enforcement crackdown
can be expected in the next
month or so. "Enforcement is
part of our overall bike safety
program," Benaderet continued,
"but for at least the next month,
due to the volumne of bicycle
traffic, no crackdown is
probable."
"When increased enforcement
does begin, we will concentrate on
the places where numerous
accidents or near-misses occur due
to violations. We will take a
common sense approach, and go
where the action is."
Increased bicycle thefts and a
planned switch from county to
state control of bike licensing in
1976 have put the main police
stress on licensing, according to
Donals.
"I don't think we've even made
a dent" in licensing all the
bicycles on the campus, he added.
A Santa Clara county ordinance
prohibits riding unlicensed
bicycles, and such vehicles can be
impounded.
"No massive impoundment of
unlicensed bikes is planned for the
next six months," Benaderet said.

"Bike impoundment, however, is
handled by the Sheriffs
department, but they will give
ample warning of any massive
impoundment."
Due to the planned shift to
state control, the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors
amended the bicycle licensing
procedure last month. The basic
fee to be paid for each vehicle is
now $2, and the license is valid
for two years. Previously, a
five-year license cost $1.
Increased use of the state's
computerized bicycle registration
system caused the price boost.
"When a bike is licensed," said
Donals, "the frame number is put
into the state's computer. Then if
a bicycle is found by the police,
its frame number can be checked
with the computer to find out
whether the bike has been
reported stolen, and who the
owner is."
Some 568 bicycles were
reported stolen to the Stanford
police in 1973, and 31 bikes were
reported stolen as of Jan. 20.
"The main reason for licensing, is
to protect the owner and to aid in
recovery and returning of stolen
property."
A further aid in the recovery is
a small "bug" stamped into the

metal of the bike's sprocket at the
time the bike is licensed. Each
county in California has its own
"bug" symbol, so police can
immediately identify the county
in which the bike was originally
licensed.
"If you purchase a bike, have
the owner sign over the white
registration form — which he
received when it was licensed — to
you, and take the white slip with
you when you license the
bicycle," suggested Donals. "This
reduces the chances of
inadvertantly purchasing a stolen
bike," he added.
Licenses can be obtianed at the
Stanford Police Services
Department from 9-11:30 a.m. on
Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays, and 12-3 p.m. on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

impounded.
"No massive impoundment of
unlicensed bikes is planned for the
next six months," Benaderet said.

"Bike impoundment, however, is
handled by the Sheriffs
department, but they will give
ample warning of any massive
impoundment."
Due to the planned shift to
state control, the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors
amended the bicycle licensing
procedure last month. The basic
fee to be paid for each vehicle is
now $2, and the license is valid
for two years. Previously, a
five-year license cost $1.
Increased use of the state's
computerized bicycle registration
system caused the price boost.
"When a bike is licensed," said
Donals, "the frame number is put
into the state's computer. Then if
a bicycle is found by the police,
its frame number can be checked
with the computer to find out
whether the bike has been
reported stolen, and who the
owner is."
Some 568 bicycles were
reported stolen to the Stanford
police in 1973, and 31 bikes were
reported stolen as of Jan. 20.
"The main reason for licensing, is
to protect the owner and to aid in
recovery and returning of stolen
property."
A further aid in the recovery is
a small "bug" stamped into the

metal of the bike's sprocket at the
time the bike is licensed. Each
county in California has its own
"bug" symbol, so police can
immediately identify the county
in which the bike was originally
licensed.
"If you purchase a bike, have
the owner sign over the white
registration form — which he
received when it was licensed — to
you, and take the white slip with
you when you license the
bicycle," suggested Donals. "This
reduces the chances of
inadvertantly purchasing a stolen
bike," he added.
Licenses can be obtianed at the
Stanford Police Services
Department from 9-11:30 a.m. on
Mondays, Wednesdays and

BIKE SAFETY URGED — Despite many near-accidents on campus due to carelessness on the part of bike
riders, the Stanford Police foresee no bike safety crackdowns in the "near future." The campus was the
scene of a fatal accident a year ago.
Present bicycling laws "will
eventually be enforced more
greatly than they are now"
according to Officer Jack Donals
of the Stanford Police Services
Department, but no bike safety
crackdown is forseeable "in the
near future."
However, the officers will be
"more aware of moving violations
than they have been in the past,"
Donals added. "The laws are for
the bicyclists' own safety, and a
rider that breaks them is taking
his own life in his hands."
Robert M. Steele, an 18 year
old freshman, was killed last June
5 when the bicycle he was riding
collided with another bike on
Escondido Road after midnight.
Neither bicycle had a light.
That incident "made the
students more aware" of bike
safety, explained Donalds, "but
now it's been completely
forgotten. They [the bike riders]
have reverted back to
carelessness."

Capt. Frank Benaderet said
that "it [the enforcement of
regulations] is up to the
individual beat officer,"and that
no major enforcement crackdown
can be expected in the next
month or so. "Enforcement is
part of our overall bike safety
program," Benaderet continued,
"but for at least the next month,
due to the volumne of bicycle
traffic, no crackdown is
probable."
"When increased enforcement
does begin, we will concentrate on
the places where numerous
accidents or near-misses occur due
to violations. We will take a
common sense approach, and go
where the action is."
Increased bicycle thefts and a
planned switch from county to
state control of bike licensing in
1976 have put the main police
stress on licensing, according to
Donals.
"I don't think we've even made
a dent" in licensing all the
bicycles on the campus, he added.

bicycles, and such vehicles can be
impounded.
