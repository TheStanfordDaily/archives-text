# Conservationists, Developers Clash Over Control Of Tahoe
##

.~#TATELINE, Nev. (AP) — Edged by winter
snow, Lake Tahoe is a royal blue crystal coveted by
conservationists for its clarity and quiet and by
developers for its commercial value in casinos and
cabins.
, ,Xhe serene, icy beauty of the lake belies the
intense legal wrangling that continues year-round
foe,control of what Mark Twain once called "the
rajQe,st picture the whole earth can afford."
Massive antipollution efforts already are under
way to preserve the lake, which is nestled 6,225
feet high in the Sierra Nevada. An $82 million
sewage export system is 90 percent complete and
apparently has solved the problem of sewage
seepage into waters.
a "1~ Algae Threat
» But tourists continue to throng the resort area
straddling the California-Nevada border. Scientists
say that means there's still a threat of increased
algae growth that already has cast a green tint to
once-blue shoreline waters.
•-i Attention now is focused on siltation and
drainage from construction activity, oily streets and
parking lots, nutrient rich golf courses and lawns
and areas stripped of natural growth.
Much of the effort to maintain the Tahoe
Basin's fragile environment is in the hands of the
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, a bistate agency
that was created in 1970 despite bitter opposition
from local interests.
Restrictive Zoning
The Lake Tahoe agency is using restrictive
zoning to control construction. It also is writing
defenses to more than $250 million in claims and
lawsuits from people who argue that their Tahoe
property was unfairly devalued in the zoning
process.
Developers continue pressure to build everything
ffom summer cottages and condominiums to

10-story casinos, reflecting the growing popularity
of Tahoe as a recreation area. The basin's
population of about 30,000 can swell to 150,000
on summer weekends.
The three Nevada counties and two California
counties that ring the lake still hold mixed views
about the agency. Pete Hollick, deputy director of
the agency, says the counties fear that rulings
against the agency in one of the many
condemnation lawsuits could leave local
governments footing the bill for damages.
The leading local government opponent of the
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is Douglas
County, Nev., where commissioners have said they
will allow grading to start next spring on two
multimillion dollar casinos that both the TRPA and
the Nevada TRPA have opposed.
Sierra Club Concerned
The TRPA's efforts to determine land use
capabilities in the Tahoe Basin also have drawn fire
from the conservationist Sierra Club.
The group has gone to court claiming that the
TRPA has failed to slow development. It backs its
claim with data on TRPA approval of a major
shopping center and casino construction or
improvements.
The TRPA hopes the problems of urbanization
can be solved through its regional plan which calls
for a population ceiling of about 300,000 and
generally allows a maximum of 30 percent land
disturbance at building sites.
Another way of controlling excessive
urbanization is through purchase of private land by
the federal government and states.
The federal government already owns more than
half the basin land. California and Nevada control
roughly 10 percent and the rest remains in private
hands. TRPA spokesman Hollick syas the proposed
goals call for public ownership of 85 percent of the
basin.
