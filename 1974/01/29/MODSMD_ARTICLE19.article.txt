# Borge's Humor ‘Respectable'
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
£ CUPERTINO — "We say so many silly things,"
Victor Borge said at one point in his often-hilarious
show last week at Flint Center.
*' Indeed, Borge said so many silly things that it
was impossible for the more than 2000 people in
attendance to keep track, but they weren't really
trying. They were trying to keep from laughing so
hard that they might miss something even funnier
ffom this musical comedian.
Borge, a gifted pianist who decided long ago that
making people laugh was more important than
playing Mozart perfectly, was a delight to everyone.
With just a grand piano and a microphone on stage,
Borge needed no other help to completely possess
the audience after the first few minutes.
Befuddled Bus Driver
t Prowling about the stage in a grey tuxedo like a
befuddled Greyhound driver in search of his bus,
Borge joked about his location ("Cupertino — the
airlines don't know where it is"), his watch ("It's
Waterproof — I've never seen water leak out of it")
and one about Nixon.
» "If Richard Nixon had been captain of the
Titanic, he would have told the passengers they
were just stopping for ice," he observed drolly.
observation drew the longest round of
applause for jokes, but Borge delighted the
audience even more when he recreated his famous
"phonetic punctuation" routine.
; A product of Borge's fertile but zany
imagination, this comedic bit involves giving sounds
tp various punctuation marks: periods, colons,

commas,question marks and so forth.
With these phonetic additions, reading a simple
passage from a book becomes a rib-splitting
exercise in gentle double entendre, and can only be
appreciated by being heard.
The same must be said of Borge's music, for he
is in the top rank of concert pianists when he plays
straight. He did play seriously in the second half of
his act, when he was joined by blonde opera singer
Marilyn Mulvey.
All Seriousness Aside...
But before any serious music, Borge and Mulvey
gave formal opera a good hard wrap on the funny
bone. Before becoming Miss Mulvey's accompanist,
Borge ate a hard boiled egg, then broke into "Jingle
Bells' while Mulvey was singing an aira from
Rigoletto.
But after using one of his piano bench props (a
seat belt) to keep from falling from his seat, Borge
settled down and the pair did a very respectable
excerpt from La Boheme.
Respectability, it seems, is the key to Borge's
entire performance. Although he mocks classical
music, he is at heart a serious artist who needs no
complex props or shocking effects to put on a
gentle, non-controversial show. Even with a few
political jokes and mild double-entendres, Borge's
show is family entertainment in its best sense.
Borge summed it up as the audience hummed
along while he played "Always" at the show's
ending. "If anyone laughed so much that he had to
use a handkerchief to wipe away the tears, then
that's my reward. The government gets the rest."

The same must be said of Borge's music, for he
is in the top rank of concert pianists when he plays
straight. He did play seriously in the second half of
his act, when he was joined by blonde opera singer
Marilyn Mulvey.
All Seriousness Aside...
But before any serious music, Borge and Mulvey
gave formal opera a good hard wrap on the funny
bone. Before becoming Miss Mulvey's accompanist,
Borge ate a hard boiled egg, then broke into "Jingle
Bells' while Mulvey was singing an aira from
Rigoletto.
But after using one of his piano bench props (a
seat belt) to keep from falling from his seat, Borge
settled down and the pair did a very respectable
excerpt from La Boheme.
Respectability, it seems, is the key to Borge's
entire performance. Although he mocks classical
music, he is at heart a serious artist who needs no
complex props or shocking effects to put on a
gentle, non-controversial show. Even with a few
political jokes and mild double-entendres, Borge's
show is family entertainment in its best sense.
Borge summed it up as the audience hummed
along while he played "Always" at the show's
ending. "If anyone laughed so much that he had to
use a handkerchief to wipe away the tears, then
that's my reward. The government gets the rest."
£ CUPERTINO — "We say so many silly things,"
Victor Borge said at one point in his often-hilarious
show last week at Flint Center.
*' Indeed, Borge said so many silly things that it
was impossible for the more than 2000 people in
attendance to keep track, but they weren't really
trying. They were trying to keep from laughing so
hard that they might miss something even funnier
ffom this musical comedian.
Borge, a gifted pianist who decided long ago that
making people laugh was more important than
playing Mozart perfectly, was a delight to everyone.
With just a grand piano and a microphone on stage,
Borge needed no other help to completely possess
the audience after the first few minutes.
Befuddled Bus Driver
t Prowling about the stage in a grey tuxedo like a
befuddled Greyhound driver in search of his bus,
Borge joked about his location ("Cupertino — the
airlines don't know where it is"), his watch ("It's
Waterproof — I've never seen water leak out of it")
and one about Nixon.
» "If Richard Nixon had been captain of the
Titanic, he would have told the passengers they
were just stopping for ice," he observed drolly.
observation drew the longest round of
applause for jokes, but Borge delighted the
audience even more when he recreated his famous
"phonetic punctuation" routine.
; A product of Borge's fertile but zany
imagination, this comedic bit involves giving sounds
tp various punctuation marks: periods, colons,

commas,question marks and so forth.
With these phonetic additions, reading a simple
passage from a book becomes a rib-splitting
exercise in gentle double entendre, and can only be
appreciated by being heard.
