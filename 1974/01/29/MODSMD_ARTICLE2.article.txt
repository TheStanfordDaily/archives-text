# Plagiarism Charged
## 'Research Aids' Offered 
### RALPH COHEN 
The sale of termpapers might seem
like an all but dead issue in California.
Since March of last year, the state has
prohibited the sale of termpapers to be
submitted for academic credit, and
advertisements for termpapers have
disappeared from California campuses.
However, with the demise of the
termpaper industry, a new industry
has emerged which might still cause
educators to agonize over student
plagiarism. These are "research
material," "research aids" and
"research papers," as they are
advertised.
Research companies operate in
much the same way that termpaper
companies did. Generally, customers
order the material they want from
catalogues, the merchandise costs from
$2 to $6 a page, and the product is a
coherent paper complete with
footnotes and bibliography. One
difference is that the research
companies require customers to sign a
statement that they will not turn in
purchased research for academic
credit.
Waiver
Research Assistance, Inc., a Los
Angeles-based firm which advertises in
the Daily, has its customers sign a
waiver that enjoins them from
plagiarizing, according to co-owner Art
Steckel. Steckel says that his firm's
research material is "non-analytical
and non-conclusive," but he adds that
it "could be turned in verbatim, but
this is not our intent."
In operation since last summer,
Research Assistance boosted its
inventory last year by purchasing
thousands of papers from two defunct
termpaper companies, Termpaper
Arsenal and Termpapers Unlimited,
according to Steckle.
Although he estimates that 75
percent of his firm's customers are
students, "the great bulk of them
undergraduates," Steckle discounts
research papers as "a threat to
academia, because only one-tenth of
one percent are used for academic
purposes."
In March, Research Assistance will
appear before an administrative court
in Los Angeles to defend itself against
a charge of using the mail for false
representation, according to Steckle.
The Department of Justice, which is

bringing the charge, seeks to revoke
the company's mailing permit.
"Losing our mailing permit will kill
us," Steckel says. "Ninety percent of
our business is through the mail."
Cards
A local research company, which
does not advertise in newspapers, has
had a good deal of success by
distributing cards on college campuses.
During the final three weeks of last
quarter, the company passed out cards
at Stanford and Foothill College, and
received 25 calls in that period,
according to a company spokesman.
Of the 25 callers, 15 people eventually
bought papers, eight of them Stanford
students, the spokesman said.
All of the Stanford purchasers were
undergraduates, the spokesman said,
but the company did receive a call
from a graduate student. The company
keeps the names of all its customers
confidential. As an example of how
well guarded the customers are, the
spokesman cited the case of two
brothers, one from Stanford and the
other from Foothill, both of whom

bought papers last quarter, each
without the other's knowledge.
For a copy of a paper, the company
charges $2.75 a page, and for original
work, $5 a page. The spokesman said
that a customer wanting original work
can specify the number of pages and
footnotes, and the length of the
bibliography. All of the papers are
ordered from Midwest Publications, a
Chicago firm, according to the
spokesman.
Ethics
Asked about the ethics of selling
material which could be turned in for
course credit, the spokesman
responded, "I think it's all right. In
certain situations I'm sympathetic
with people, like the science major
required to take a poetry class. If it's
more agony than anything else, I
would think it's fine. But for myself, I
couldn't do it."
Another research company which
operates in the Bay Area is Research
Unlimited. Eric Nisenson, manager of
the company, said he did not know
how many of his customers were
students becuase he did not inquire
about his customers. He said his
customers included "all kinds."
According to Nisenson, his
company is not in the business of
selling termpapers. What it sells, he
said, is "finished research."
"We don't have any legal hassles,"
Nisenson said, "because we aren't
doing anything illegal."
Plagarism
If a student is caught turning in a
ghostwritten paper and a complaint is
lodged against him with the Dean of
Student Affairs, he is likely to appear
before the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP), the faculty-student body which
rules on cases of student misconduct.
Neither last academic year, nor so
far this year, has the CJP reviewed a
case of student plagiarism, according
to Prof. Daniel Bershader, a panel
member. Bershader could not say how
the CJP might rule on such a case
because "circumstances are so various"
in each case. He added, however, that
"buying and bluffing" were always
considered serious offenses by the
Faculty Senate.
Speaking as a teacher, Bershader

found two aspects of purchased papers
distasteful: the practice is "ultimately
harmful to the University's standards
and unfair to other students and their
relative grades"; and a student who
relies on a ghostwritten paper "in lieu
of hard effort, doesn't know his stuff"
and misrepresents his education.
Prof. William Keough, chairman of
the CJP, also declined to speculate on
how the panel might rule in such a
case "because the extenuating
circumstances are so wide-ranging."
As a teacher, however, he said he
"would be disappointed."
David Kennedy, an associate
professor of history known for his
demanding teaching methods, said he
"never had occasion to suspect" a
purchased paper. He declared that he
would be "strongly inclined to flunk
the student" if he discovered a
ghostwritten paper, and added "I
don't think there could be any
extenuating circumstances."
