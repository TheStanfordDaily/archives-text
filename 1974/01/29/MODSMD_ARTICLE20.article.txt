# Jazz Veteran In Boarding House Debut
## Mose's Piano, Voice Swing Subtly 
### SHERIDAN CRAWFORD 
SAN FRANCISCO - Everyone
at the Boarding House Thursday
night seemed greatly pleased to
hear Mose Allison's piano filling
the dark hall. Making his first
Boarding House appearance, Mose
performed smoothly and easily
accompanied by a bassist and
drummer.
He came on wearing a very red
shirt and as soon as his hands
contacted the keyboard, his curly
silver hair took on a faint glow.
He never once spoke directly to
the audience, but performed
continuously, playing along a
silver strand of time.
The trio began with a "laid
back" instrumental best described
as "Ba-ba-bee-ba-ch-ch-chee-cha."
The low throbbing beat and a nice
bass solo soon put musicians and
audience at east with each other,
i ... Hands Come Alive
The second number was
louder, quickler, punctuated by
crescendoes and small silences.
Allison's hands seem to take on a
life all thier own and move with
an energy which throws them high
above the keyboard before they
touch down.
There was one low sustained
pause in the music, during which a
glass fell from one of the tables
and shattered. In the next instant,
they broke open with an
explosion of sound from all three
musicians and travelled upwards.
Allison produces a sound and
momentum which can be

followed both outwardly and
inwardly — toe tapping, subtle
shaking, with new vistas in
sight.
Next, the group started a blues
dialogue with the audience.
Allison began with "Ain't that
just like livin'/ Whatever happened
to the real life." He used his voice
more as an added instrument than
the main focus of the song. The
audience was glad, even relieved,
to have Mose talking to them
finally. There were some who
shouted "You tell it, Mose!" and
"Say it!"
Urban Blues
He went down further with
two songs featuring the city blues.
When he reached "You are my
sunshine — please don't take my
sunshine away," time had slowed
and the voice and piano were
dark, filled with night. He then
lifted everyone up with a rousing
"I live like I love and love like I
live," followed by a slower "My
mind is on vacation/ mouth is
working overtime."
He was brought back for an
encore, and played an audience
favorite, "Parchman Farm." "I'm
gonna be here for the rest of my

life/ all I did was shoot my wife."
For most, it crowned a superb,
relaxed evening. A large portion
stayed for the late show. It could
have been that it was just too hard
to move.
Mimi Farina opened the show,
but her presence was short of
being fully realized. She carries on
a verbal as well as musical
dialogue which rarely seems
forced, but her generally ironic
mood this night, set the tone. "I
am not a person," she said. "I am
an act — a marginal act." She sang
pretty versions of "I Can See
Clearly Now" and "Daniel."
She also evoked memories of

her tour with Hoyt Axton with
whom she appeared last spring at
the Boarding House in a more
vibrant state than Thursday night.
She paid tribute to him with his
song "I am less than the song I am
singing/ I am more than I thought
I could be."
Farina is less passionate,
perhaps less committed than her
sister, but easy to listen to. For
her encore, she sang "Stewball,"
best described as vintage folk. The
audience sang along softly in an
undercurrent of rumbling and
murmuring and they were happy.
It was Mimi herself who seemed
the least enthusiastic, bound by
her past and present, looking for a
way out.
