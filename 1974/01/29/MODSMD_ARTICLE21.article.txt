# Parkening Shows Mastery
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
In the style of a master,
classical guitarist Christopher
Parkening quietly sat down and
hypnotized a capacity crowd in
Memorial Auditorium Friday
evening.
Although he had to pause in
his program after the first piece to
allow for late arrivals to straggle
in, he didn't let this bother him
and went on to give an amazing
performance.
His program featured such
well-known pieces as Prelude I
from The Well-Tempered Clavier
by Johann Sebastian Bach, and
"Sarabande With Variations" by
George Frederick Handel.
Debussy's "Clair de

Lune" was hampered by guitar
"squeaks," as were other pieces,
Parkening more than made up for
this with his flawless playing of a
very difficult "Gigue" by Sylvius

Entertainment

Leopold Weiss.
Difficult Ravel Suite
Another highlight of
Parkening's performance was his
interpretation of "Empress of

Pagodas" (or "The Mother Goose
Suite") by Ravel, with its rapid
melody and difficult harmonics.
At the end of the program, the
enthusiastic audience showed its

approval with shouts of "bravo"
and whistles of appreciation. They
brought Parkening back for four
encores, where he again showed
faultless technique.

He played Bach's "Jesu, Joy of
Man's Desiring," "The Girl with
the Flaxen Hair" by Debussy,
"Romance," an anonymous
Italian piece, and an
"African-Cuban Lullaby" that
Parkening learned from a friend in,
of all places, Nashville, Tennessee.
It was strange to hear
Parkening's voice when he
introduced the encores. After
listening for more than an hour to
the intricate and yet melodic
passages of his music, one might
get the idea that it was only a
record.
Years of Practice
Parkening made it all look so
easy, but his kind of musicianship
only comes after years of constant
practice. It is indeed an incredible
accomplishment that such a
young man (26) could have risen
so far and so fast in the music
world.
Parkening, a native Califomian,
took up the guitar when he was
eleven. He has studied under
Andres Segovia, and currently
heads the Guitar Department at
USC. He has made appearances
with symphonies across the
country. His future
around-the-world concert
itinerary includes Toyko, London,
Paris, Madrid, Munich,
Amsterdam, and Copenhagen.
Parkening is one of the greatest
guitarists in the world today.
Because the guitar is an
instrument that can be played
well, even when the guitarist is
over eighty years old, it is obvious
that Parkening has many years of
playing time ahead. He will
probably be the best in the world
someday, perhaps the greatest
guitarist of all time.

encores, where he again showed
faultless technique.

He played Bach's "Jesu, Joy of
Man's Desiring," "The Girl with
the Flaxen Hair" by Debussy,
"Romance," an anonymous
Italian piece, and an
"African-Cuban Lullaby" that
Parkening learned from a friend in,
of all places, Nashville, Tennessee.
It was strange to hear
Parkening's voice when he
introduced the encores. After
listening for more than an hour to
the intricate and yet melodic
passages of his music, one might
get the idea that it was only a
record.
Years of Practice
Parkening made it all look so
easy, but his kind of musicianship
only comes after years of constant
practice. It is indeed an incredible
accomplishment that such a
young man (26) could have risen
so far and so fast in the music
world.
Parkening, a native Califomian,
took up the guitar when he was
eleven. He has studied under
Andres Segovia, and currently
heads the Guitar Department at
USC. He has made appearances
with symphonies across the
country. His future
around-the-world concert
itinerary includes Toyko, London,
Paris, Madrid, Munich,
Amsterdam, and Copenhagen.
Parkening is one of the greatest
guitarists in the world today.
Because the guitar is an
instrument that can be played
well, even when the guitarist is
over eighty years old, it is obvious
that Parkening has many years of
playing time ahead. He will
probably be the best in the world
someday, perhaps the greatest
guitarist of all time.
In the style of a master,
classical guitarist Christopher
Parkening quietly sat down and
hypnotized a capacity crowd in
Memorial Auditorium Friday
evening.
Although he had to pause in
his program after the first piece to
allow for late arrivals to straggle
in, he didn't let this bother him
and went on to give an amazing
performance.
His program featured such
well-known pieces as Prelude I
from The Well-Tempered Clavier
by Johann Sebastian Bach, and
"Sarabande With Variations" by
George Frederick Handel.
Debussy's "Clair de

Lune" was hampered by guitar
"squeaks," as were other pieces,
Parkening more than made up for
this with his flawless playing of a
very difficult "Gigue" by Sylvius

Entertainment

Leopold Weiss.
Difficult Ravel Suite
Another highlight of
Parkening's performance was his
interpretation of "Empress of

Pagodas" (or "The Mother Goose
Suite") by Ravel, with its rapid
melody and difficult harmonics.
At the end of the program, the
enthusiastic audience showed its

approval with shouts of "bravo"
and whistles of appreciation. They
brought Parkening back for four
encores, where he again showed
faultless technique.
