# Eastwood In 'Magnum Force'
## The 						Return Of 'Dirty Harryâ€™ 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
Even on a Sunday afternoon
months after its release, Magnum
Force draws a crowd. In much the
same way as James Bond and our
man Flint, Harry Calahan ahs
become a folk hero with a
following. Like Dirty Harry, the
first Harry Calahan film, Magnum

Force is a well-done film out of
the stock sex-violence genre that
has spawned such favorites as
Bullitt and, more recently, The
French Connection. Directed by
Ted Post, and starring Clint
Eastwood as Harry Calahan,
Magnum Force is another San
Francisco film about cops and
hoods.
An audience can usually
predict the tone and pace of a
film by its initial credits, and
Magnum Force is no exception.
The film opens with a hand-held
magnum 44, profiled against a red
background, which is magnified in
degrees as the credits are viewed.
Calahan defines the terms of the
film as the gun is turned toward
the audience and fired: "This is a
magnum 44. It could blow your
head off. Don't you feel lucky?"
For the audience, it is a brutally
straightforward introduction.
Once underway, the most
striking aspect of the film is its
adherence to American
stereotypes. Calahan himself is a
fast-paced stoic whose reputation
as a lover is second only to his
virtuosity with a magnum. He is
the young, unattached American
male, insolent and egotistical, for
whom nothing seems impossible.
Much of the dialogue in the film
reflects this image of the man of
action who is attractive to both
men and women almost by
magnetism.
In one scene, for example, an
encounter between Calahan and a
woman living in his apartment
building is initialed by her

unlikely propositioning question,
"What does a girl have to do to go
to bed with you?" With typical
nonchalance Calahan remarks,
"Try knocking on the door."
This type of exchange is often
satirical as, for example, when
after sleeping with Calahan, the
girl declares "You're my first
cop." Several of the many eating
scenes in the film are similarly
satirized when juxtaposed with its
excessive violence. A particularly
good exchange occurs when, while
eating a sandwich, Calahan and a
cook discuss corpses by using
various food-related similies.
Calahan's partner, who often
functions as the straight man,
mimics audience revulsion.
Several motifs in Magnum
Force are successfully introduced
and maintained through the film's
skillful photography. Calahan, for
example, is made to look taller
and more imposing by being
filmed at an angle tilting upwards
from ground level. Rifles and guns
are forever rendered as images of
potential violence through the use
of close-up, silhouette, and profile
techniques. The consistent
photographic tone is a cold, hard,
and brutal reinforcement of the
film's thematic import.
For what it is, Magnum Force
is a fairly well-presented film that
can best be described by the
recurring advice of its hero,
"man's got to know his
limitations." It would seem that
the makers of Harry Calahan did,
and stayed well within them.

the stock sex-violence genre that
has spawned such favorites as
Bullitt and, more recently, The
French Connection. Directed by
Ted Post, and starring Clint
Eastwood as Harry Calahan,
Magnum Force is another San
Francisco film about cops and
hoods.
An audience can usually
predict the tone and pace of a
film by its initial credits, and
Magnum Force is no exception.
The film opens with a hand-held
magnum 44, profiled against a red
background, which is magnified in
degrees as the credits are viewed.
Calahan defines the terms of the
film as the gun is turned toward
the audience and fired: "This is a
magnum 44. It could blow your
head off. Don't you feel lucky?"
For the audience, it is a brutally
straightforward introduction.
Once underway, the most
striking aspect of the film is its
adherence to American
stereotypes. Calahan himself is a
fast-paced stoic whose reputation
as a lover is second only to his
virtuosity with a magnum. He is
the young, unattached American
male, insolent and egotistical, for
whom nothing seems impossible.
Much of the dialogue in the film
reflects this image of the man of
action who is attractive to both
men and women almost by
magnetism.
In one scene, for example, an
encounter between Calahan and a
woman living in his apartment
building is initialed by her

unlikely propositioning question,
"What does a girl have to do to go
to bed with you?" With typical
nonchalance Calahan remarks,
"Try knocking on the door."
This type of exchange is often
satirical as, for example, when
after sleeping with Calahan, the
girl declares "You're my first
cop." Several of the many eating
scenes in the film are similarly
satirized when juxtaposed with its
excessive violence. A particularly
good exchange occurs when, while
eating a sandwich, Calahan and a
cook discuss corpses by using
various food-related similies.
Calahan's partner, who often
functions as the straight man,
mimics audience revulsion.
Several motifs in Magnum
Force are successfully introduced
and maintained through the film's
skillful photography. Calahan, for
example, is made to look taller
and more imposing by being
filmed at an angle tilting upwards
from ground level. Rifles and guns
are forever rendered as images of
potential violence through the use
of close-up, silhouette, and profile
techniques. The consistent
photographic tone is a cold, hard,
and brutal reinforcement of the
film's thematic import.
For what it is, Magnum Force
is a fairly well-presented film that
can best be described by the
recurring advice of its hero,
"man's got to know his
limitations." It would seem that
the makers of Harry Calahan did,
and stayed well within them.
Even on a Sunday afternoon
months after its release, Magnum
Force draws a crowd. In much the
same way as James Bond and our
man Flint, Harry Calahan ahs
become a folk hero with a
following. Like Dirty Harry, the
first Harry Calahan film, Magnum

Force is a well-done film out of

Bullitt and, more recently, The
