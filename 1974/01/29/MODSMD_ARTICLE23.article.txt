Israel Continues Fullback
1 SUEZ — Israeli soldiers sang and waved gaily from
armored personnel carriers yesterday as they evacuated
about a third of the Egyptian territory they captured in the
last Middle East war.
The Israeli army radio said Egyptian soldiers fired
dockets and machine guns into the air to mark their
jubilation as they moved in and took control about six
hours after the Israelis left.
The pullout lifted the 97-day siege of Suez City, with its
15,000 civilians, and freed supply lines to the some 20,000
troops of the Egyptian 3rd Army encircled since the closing
hours of October's fighting.
As the Egyptians regained the same 300 square miles of
land, the Israeli military command reported that Syrian
forces mortared Israeli positions in the third straight day of
clashes on the Golan Heights far to the north. The
spokesman in Tel Aviv claimed the Israelis held their fire
and said there were no casualties.
Former Nixon Aide Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON — Herbert L. Porter, the scheduling
director of President Nixon's re-election campaign, pleaded
guilty yesterday to lying to the FBI in its Watergate
investigation. He was released pending a pre-sentence
report.
Porter, 35, faces a maximum five years in prison and a
fine of $10,000.
Porter admitted to the Senate Watergate Committee that
he told a false story about the authorization of the funds
used for the Watergate burglary to the FBI, a grand jury
and at the Watergate trial.
He said he did it at the suggestion of Jeb. S. Magruder,
deputy director of the re-election committee, who has
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice and defraud
the United States.
The false story was that break-in boss G. Gordon Liddy
had received $100,000 to hire college students in the
campaign — when in fact the funds had gone for "dirty
tricks."
Legislature Overrides Reagan Veto
SACRAMENTO — The California Legislature yesterday
overrode Gov. Ronald Reagan's veto of a bill requiring
legislative approval to close state mental hospitals.
It marked the first time in 28 years a California chief
executive's veto was nullified.
The override came on a 27-13 vote by the Senate, which
four days earlier fell only one vote short of an override. The
vote gave the measure the exact tally it needed to win
passage.
The Assembly voted 63-11 previously to override.
It was the first override since Feb. 13, 1946 when the
legislature nullified a veto by then Gov. Earl Warren of $90
million for city and county construction project.
Brown Enters Governor's Race
SAN FRANCISCO — Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr., formally announcing his candidacy for governor,
declared yesterday, in a news conference at his boyhood
home, he would have proposed spending a $721 million
budget surplus rather than returning it as a tax rebate.

The 35-year-old Democrat said the money should have
gone into badly needed programs such as better schools in
California's low-income areas rather than back to the
taxpayers.
Brown, seeking the post his father held for eight years,
also said the state should reverse the phase-out of state
mental hospitals and beef up its job-placement program for
the unemployed.
In his announcement statement, Brown said his first act
as governor would be a sweeping reorganization of the
state's executive branch, creating two super agencies dealing
with energy development and research and with
environmental problems and planning.
Congressman Gubser To Retire
SAN JOSE — Rep. Charles S. Gubser, a 21-year veteran
Republican lawmaker whose district once included
Stanford, said yesterday he will not seek reelection to the
reapportioned 13th Congressional District in Santa Clara
County.
Gubser, 57, of Gilroy said yesterday one reason for his
decision was the loss of two prime GOP strongholds in
reapportionment — Los Altos and Los Altos Hills.
Gubser said he considered retirement two years ago and
relented but added that this decision was "irreversible."
Ali Wins Unanimous Decision
NEW YORK — Muhammad Ali, scoring with short
left-and-right counter punches to the head and left jabs,
outboxed and outpunched Joe Frazier to win a unanimous
12-round decision last night at Madison Square Garden and
avenge a defeat in their famous first fight almost three years
ago.
Today's Weather
Variable high cloudiness through tomorrow but mostly
sunny afternoons and night and morning fog or low
cloudiness. Low temperatures tonight in the upper 30s to
mid 40s. Highs both days in the mid 50s to low 60s. Light
winds.

armored personnel carriers yesterday as they evacuated
about a third of the Egyptian territory they captured in the
last Middle East war.
The Israeli army radio said Egyptian soldiers fired
dockets and machine guns into the air to mark their
jubilation as they moved in and took control about six
hours after the Israelis left.
The pullout lifted the 97-day siege of Suez City, with its
15,000 civilians, and freed supply lines to the some 20,000
troops of the Egyptian 3rd Army encircled since the closing
hours of October's fighting.
As the Egyptians regained the same 300 square miles of
land, the Israeli military command reported that Syrian
forces mortared Israeli positions in the third straight day of
clashes on the Golan Heights far to the north. The
spokesman in Tel Aviv claimed the Israelis held their fire
and said there were no casualties.
Former Nixon Aide Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON — Herbert L. Porter, the scheduling
director of President Nixon's re-election campaign, pleaded
guilty yesterday to lying to the FBI in its Watergate
investigation. He was released pending a pre-sentence
report.
Porter, 35, faces a maximum five years in prison and a
fine of $10,000.
Porter admitted to the Senate Watergate Committee that
he told a false story about the authorization of the funds
used for the Watergate burglary to the FBI, a grand jury
and at the Watergate trial.
He said he did it at the suggestion of Jeb. S. Magruder,
deputy director of the re-election committee, who has
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice and defraud
the United States.
The false story was that break-in boss G. Gordon Liddy
had received $100,000 to hire college students in the
campaign — when in fact the funds had gone for "dirty
tricks."
Legislature Overrides Reagan Veto
SACRAMENTO — The California Legislature yesterday
overrode Gov. Ronald Reagan's veto of a bill requiring
legislative approval to close state mental hospitals.
It marked the first time in 28 years a California chief
executive's veto was nullified.
The override came on a 27-13 vote by the Senate, which
four days earlier fell only one vote short of an override. The
vote gave the measure the exact tally it needed to win
passage.
The Assembly voted 63-11 previously to override.
It was the first override since Feb. 13, 1946 when the
legislature nullified a veto by then Gov. Earl Warren of $90
million for city and county construction project.
Brown Enters Governor's Race
SAN FRANCISCO — Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr., formally announcing his candidacy for governor,
declared yesterday, in a news conference at his boyhood
home, he would have proposed spending a $721 million
budget surplus rather than returning it as a tax rebate.

The 35-year-old Democrat said the money should have
gone into badly needed programs such as better schools in
California's low-income areas rather than back to the
taxpayers.
Brown, seeking the post his father held for eight years,
also said the state should reverse the phase-out of state
mental hospitals and beef up its job-placement program for
the unemployed.
In his announcement statement, Brown said his first act
as governor would be a sweeping reorganization of the
state's executive branch, creating two super agencies dealing
with energy development and research and with
environmental problems and planning.
Congressman Gubser To Retire
SAN JOSE — Rep. Charles S. Gubser, a 21-year veteran
Republican lawmaker whose district once included
Stanford, said yesterday he will not seek reelection to the
reapportioned 13th Congressional District in Santa Clara
County.
Gubser, 57, of Gilroy said yesterday one reason for his
decision was the loss of two prime GOP strongholds in
reapportionment — Los Altos and Los Altos Hills.
Gubser said he considered retirement two years ago and
relented but added that this decision was "irreversible."
Ali Wins Unanimous Decision
NEW YORK — Muhammad Ali, scoring with short
left-and-right counter punches to the head and left jabs,
outboxed and outpunched Joe Frazier to win a unanimous
12-round decision last night at Madison Square Garden and
avenge a defeat in their famous first fight almost three years
ago.

about a third of the Egyptian territory they captured in the
last Middle East war.
The Israeli army radio said Egyptian soldiers fired
dockets and machine guns into the air to mark their
jubilation as they moved in and took control about six
hours after the Israelis left.
The pullout lifted the 97-day siege of Suez City, with its
15,000 civilians, and freed supply lines to the some 20,000
troops of the Egyptian 3rd Army encircled since the closing
hours of October's fighting.
As the Egyptians regained the same 300 square miles of
land, the Israeli military command reported that Syrian
forces mortared Israeli positions in the third straight day of
clashes on the Golan Heights far to the north. The
spokesman in Tel Aviv claimed the Israelis held their fire
and said there were no casualties.
Former Nixon Aide Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON — Herbert L. Porter, the scheduling
director of President Nixon's re-election campaign, pleaded
guilty yesterday to lying to the FBI in its Watergate
investigation. He was released pending a pre-sentence
report.
Porter, 35, faces a maximum five years in prison and a
fine of $10,000.
Porter admitted to the Senate Watergate Committee that
he told a false story about the authorization of the funds
used for the Watergate burglary to the FBI, a grand jury
and at the Watergate trial.
He said he did it at the suggestion of Jeb. S. Magruder,
deputy director of the re-election committee, who has
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice and defraud
the United States.
The false story was that break-in boss G. Gordon Liddy
had received $100,000 to hire college students in the
campaign — when in fact the funds had gone for "dirty
tricks."
Legislature Overrides Reagan Veto
SACRAMENTO — The California Legislature yesterday
overrode Gov. Ronald Reagan's veto of a bill requiring
legislative approval to close state mental hospitals.
It marked the first time in 28 years a California chief
executive's veto was nullified.
The override came on a 27-13 vote by the Senate, which
four days earlier fell only one vote short of an override. The
vote gave the measure the exact tally it needed to win
passage.
The Assembly voted 63-11 previously to override.
It was the first override since Feb. 13, 1946 when the
legislature nullified a veto by then Gov. Earl Warren of $90
million for city and county construction project.
Brown Enters Governor's Race
SAN FRANCISCO — Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr., formally announcing his candidacy for governor,
declared yesterday, in a news conference at his boyhood
home, he would have proposed spending a $721 million
budget surplus rather than returning it as a tax rebate.

The 35-year-old Democrat said the money should have
gone into badly needed programs such as better schools in
California's low-income areas rather than back to the
taxpayers.
Brown, seeking the post his father held for eight years,
also said the state should reverse the phase-out of state
mental hospitals and beef up its job-placement program for
the unemployed.
In his announcement statement, Brown said his first act
as governor would be a sweeping reorganization of the
state's executive branch, creating two super agencies dealing
with energy development and research and with
environmental problems and planning.
Congressman Gubser To Retire
SAN JOSE — Rep. Charles S. Gubser, a 21-year veteran
Republican lawmaker whose district once included
Stanford, said yesterday he will not seek reelection to the
reapportioned 13th Congressional District in Santa Clara
County.
Gubser, 57, of Gilroy said yesterday one reason for his
decision was the loss of two prime GOP strongholds in
reapportionment — Los Altos and Los Altos Hills.
Gubser said he considered retirement two years ago and
relented but added that this decision was "irreversible."
Ali Wins Unanimous Decision
NEW YORK — Muhammad Ali, scoring with short
left-and-right counter punches to the head and left jabs,
outboxed and outpunched Joe Frazier to win a unanimous
12-round decision last night at Madison Square Garden and
avenge a defeat in their famous first fight almost three years
ago.
