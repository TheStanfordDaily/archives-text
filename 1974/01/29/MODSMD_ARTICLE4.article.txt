# Faculty Senate — A Potent Assembly
## 
### DIANE NORBURG 
Last week's ROTC issue awoke a
second "sleeping dog" for many
students.
This "sleeping dog," although it
appears in the news at least twice a
month, is the little understood Faculty
Senate. Most students have no idea
what it is, much less what it does.
Others have a vague notion that it is
the professoriate counterpart to the
ASSU.
According to Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbiglcr, the Senate is the
legislative and deliberative body of the
faculty. "It is opposed to the trustees
and the student senate in that it speaks
only to and for the faculty," he said.
The Faculty Senate's right to
determine the future of ROTC here
identifies it as a potent force within
the University. The scope of its
governing power includes any issue in
which the faculty is empowered to
make a final decision.
"ROTC is going nowhere else,"
Winbigler said. "The faculty views
prevailed here because of their
traditional jurisdiction over academic
credit.
"The faculty decreed that there
shall be no academic credit,"

therefore, ROTC was dead [in
19701," he added.
Although an occasional
controversial issue calls extra student
attention to the Faculty Senate, most
of the time it considers items relevant
primarily to the faculty.
One example of debate during fall
quarter was the question of how often,
if at all, professors should be required
to circulate teaching evaluation sheets
in their classes.
This year the Senate has considered
such problems as academic freedom,
faculty discipline and a statement on
evaluation of teaching. In addition, the
Senate hears annual reports from
standing University committees.
Now in its sixth year of existence,
the Senate is composed of 53 voting
members and 12 non-voting ex officio
members. The ex officio members
include the President, the Provost, the
deans of Undergraduate and Graduate
Studies, the deans of the seven schools
and the Academic Secretary.
Membership
Senators are elected to two-year
terms from 13 constituent bodies
within the University. To be eligible, a
candidate must be a member of the

Academic Council, which requires the
rank of professor, associate professor
or assistant professor.
Half of the senators from each
constituency are elected each year to
assure that a complete membership
turn-over does not occur. Elections for
next year's Senate will be held
between March 29 and April 19.
A list of all professors of eligible
rank will be mailed from the Academic
Secretary's office to each Academic
Council member, with lists separated
according to the appropriate
constituency. All professors of
required rank, except those who have
served two consecutive Senate terms,
are listed as candidates.
Votes are tabulated according to
the Hare system of proportional
representation.
Composition
Operating under its first
reapportionment (the Senate Charter
requires one every five years), the
Senate has its largest constituent body
within the School of Humanities and
Sciences, which has 25 voting
members. Next largest are the Schools
of Medicine and Engineering, both
with eight.
All other schools have three, two or
one voting representatives. The Food
Research Institute, SLAC and a special
group composed of deans and
directors for University programs are
each allowed one representative.
Apportionment is based on the
combined factor of the number of
students enrolled in each school and
the number of professors employed.
Criticism
This method has brought some
criticism, especially over the
representational difference between
the School of Medicine and the School
of Law. The two professional schools
have approximately the same number
of students, Winbugler explained, but
medicine has 280-290 faculty
members compared to only 30 in law.
"The disproportionately large
number of faculty members in the
School of Medicine accounts for its
high representation," Winbigler said.
"And I would have to say that, in
general, attendance from the Med
School is the poorest because of
conflicts from clinical schedules."
Winbugler said that Faculty Senate
attendance is better, on the average,
than attendance at ASSU Senate
meetings. The Faculty Senate has not
failed to achieve a quorum of 27
voting members yet this year.

One aspect of Senate membership
which has received particular attention
this year is the number of women
currently seated.
"Until this year we had a maximum
of two women on the Senate,"
Winbugler said. "I think we have more
now primarily because of the women's
caucus efforts a year ago."
A check of the 1974 roster shows
10 women members with voting
privileges. All ex officio members are
men.
The Faculty Senate will continue to
hold its regularly scheduled Thursday
meeting every other week. The last
meeting for this academic year is
planned for June 13, as it is usually
unnecessary for the Senate to meet
during the summer months.

AMERICAN GRAFFITI — Twenty Columbae House members observed the
anniversary of Henry Kissinger's peace announcement by painting this sign on
the fence surrounding the Claw yesterday morning. It points out "that a year has
gone by and peace is still not here" and the "U.S. is still guilty in bringing deaths
in Vietnam," according to one Columbae resident.
