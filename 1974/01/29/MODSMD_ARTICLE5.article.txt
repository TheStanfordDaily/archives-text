# Law Prof Discusses Impeaching
## 
### GRAHAM VINK 
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther sees the
issue of President Nixon's
impeachment not so much a criminal
matter as an "ultimate curb on
executive irresponsibility and abuse of
trust."
Speaking at the taping of KZSU's
"Campus Conference," which will be
aired this evening, Gunther said the
problem facing Congress is not the
determination of Nixon's guilt or
innocence, but the determination of
what standards he will be judged by.
He pointed out there is "no carefully
developed body of federal law" and
that precedents created for
impeachment are notoriously weak
and fuzzy.
Gunther agreed that, in theory,
"Congress can do anything it pleases,"
but he felt an actual impeachment
debate would fall somewhere between
an open-ended criminal matter and a
strict interpretation of the criminal
code.
Many of the accusations leveled
against Nixon — such as domestic
wiretapping, the income tax case and
the questionable donation of his
papers to the government — are not
grounds for impeachment since they
are not clear-cut criminal offenses,
Gunther said. However, Nixon could
be impeached and convicted if he
deliberately ordered the 18-minute
tape erasure, Gunther said, since those
actions would clearly be criminal.
Gunther said he hoped for
"contemporary thought" on the entire
question of impeachment. He said the
House Judiciary Committee is a good
forum for discussion and foresaw the
possibility of a bipartisan agreement
on the ground rules for impeachment.
Speaking of precedents, Gunther
cited the example of a federal judge
who was impeached and removed from
office in the 19305. The judge was
tried before Congress under a
"catch-all" charge — "bringing his
office into great disrepute" — along
with a number of more substantive

charges.
Congress found the judge not guilty
of the specific charges, but found
against him on the "catch-all" charge,
and removed him from office.
Questioned on the dangers of
impeachment, Gunther admitted the
process might be "traumatic. No
doubt it will be a very messy
business."
However, he added, "it might be
more divisive if the President resigns,
saying, 'I've been hounded out of
office by political opponents,' than if
he simply gets impeached."
Gunther was opposed to possible
"deals" between the President and

Congress or the Justice Dept. He noted
that the Constitution specifically
provided for possible criminal
prosecution after removal from office.
"Executive privilege" will not be a
valid claim for withholding documents
from the House or Senate during
impeachment proceedings, according
to Gunther. Since impeachment is the
only way a President can be removed
from office, Congress must have access
to information from the President in
order to conduct a reasonable inquiry,
he said.
The program can be heard tonight
at 7 on KZSU 90.1 FM.
