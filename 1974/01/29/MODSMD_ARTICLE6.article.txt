# Confusion Mounts Over GSB Lounge Tax Status
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
Last fall, the Master of Business
Administration Student Association
(MBASA) discovered a badly written
contract had exposed the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) Lounge to
possible prosecution for failing to pay
the five percent sales tax on food.
University staff counsel Cassius
Kirk told the MBASA that the
wording of the contract implied that
the lounge operators — who bid
competitively each year for the right
to manage the lounge — were
independent from the student
association. While the law exempts
"student association" concessions,
Kirk said, independent student
operators must pay the sales tax.
The lounge has been in operation
for five years and no taxes have ever
been paid. If the state wished, it could
prosecute past lounge operators for
thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes.
Jeff Malone, MBASA vice president
and one of the current lounge
operators, said that the contract had
never expressed the intention of the
MBASA. "We had always assumed that
we were tax-exempt," he said. "Since
we found out we weren't, we've been
trying to be very honest and disclose
everything."
Negotiations
During the past few months,
MBASA treasurer Peter Patch has been
informally negotiating with the State

Board of Equalization to try to clear
up the misunderstanding and get past
operators off the hook. Patch said that
the issue of back taxes is "sensitive,"
but that he hoped that the Board
would be lenient.
The MBASA plans to send its first
quarterly check in payment of this
year's lounge sales tax this week. This
sum will be added to $525 already on
deposit.
The MBASA hopes to further
assure the Board of its good intentions
by changing the lounge contract next
spring to make it officially a student
association operation. Such a move
will also provide the lounge with the
desired sales tax exemption.
Don't Have Money
"It was never our intention to have
the operators responsible," said
Mai one. "We don't have the money,
but they certainly don't have the
money to pay off the back taxes."
Kirk and MBASA President Frank
Brokaw also said that their major
concern, aside from straightening out
the lounge's liabilities with the state, is
to protect past operators, many of
whom have already left Stanford.
The MBASA probe into the
lounge's tax responsibilities also
unearthed two other daily infractions.
The lounge has been selling food to
faculty and staff since the operation
began, but such sales are not tax-exempt under the
"student organization" clause. MBASA officers estimate
that 10 to 20 percent of the lounge's gross receipts come
from these sales to non-students.
In addition, the lounge has been selling many
"non-food" items that are not tax-exempt. Among these
are cigarettes and soft drinks.
No matter what the contract is for the lounge next year,
the five percent sales tax will have to be charged and paid
on these two matters. Brokaw, however, emphasized that
consumers would not have to pay higher prices because of
previous liabilities.
"Prices would only be raised to cover the cost of
inflation," he said. "The students will not have to shoulder
the burden." Brokaw said he expected the spring Lounge
Committee either to reduce operator profits or to ask for
lower lounge management bids.

"non-food" items that are not tax-exempt. Among these
are cigarettes and soft drinks.
No matter what the contract is for the lounge next year,
the five percent sales tax will have to be charged and paid
on these two matters. Brokaw, however, emphasized that
consumers would not have to pay higher prices because of
previous liabilities.
"Prices would only be raised to cover the cost of
inflation," he said. "The students will not have to shoulder
the burden." Brokaw said he expected the spring Lounge
Committee either to reduce operator profits or to ask for
lower lounge management bids.
Last fall, the Master of Business
Administration Student Association
(MBASA) discovered a badly written
contract had exposed the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) Lounge to
possible prosecution for failing to pay
the five percent sales tax on food.
University staff counsel Cassius
Kirk told the MBASA that the
wording of the contract implied that
the lounge operators — who bid
competitively each year for the right
to manage the lounge — were
independent from the student
association. While the law exempts
"student association" concessions,
Kirk said, independent student
operators must pay the sales tax.
The lounge has been in operation
for five years and no taxes have ever
been paid. If the state wished, it could
prosecute past lounge operators for
thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes.
Jeff Malone, MBASA vice president
and one of the current lounge
operators, said that the contract had
never expressed the intention of the
MBASA. "We had always assumed that
we were tax-exempt," he said. "Since
we found out we weren't, we've been
trying to be very honest and disclose
everything."
Negotiations
During the past few months,
MBASA treasurer Peter Patch has been
informally negotiating with the State

Board of Equalization to try to clear
up the misunderstanding and get past
operators off the hook. Patch said that
the issue of back taxes is "sensitive,"
but that he hoped that the Board
would be lenient.
The MBASA plans to send its first
quarterly check in payment of this
year's lounge sales tax this week. This
sum will be added to $525 already on
deposit.
The MBASA hopes to further
assure the Board of its good intentions
by changing the lounge contract next
spring to make it officially a student
association operation. Such a move
will also provide the lounge with the
desired sales tax exemption.
Don't Have Money
"It was never our intention to have
the operators responsible," said
Mai one. "We don't have the money,
but they certainly don't have the
money to pay off the back taxes."
Kirk and MBASA President Frank
Brokaw also said that their major
concern, aside from straightening out
the lounge's liabilities with the state, is
to protect past operators, many of
whom have already left Stanford.
The MBASA probe into the
lounge's tax responsibilities also
unearthed two other daily infractions.
The lounge has been selling food to
faculty and staff since the operation
began, but such sales are not tax-exempt under the
"student organization" clause. MBASA officers estimate
that 10 to 20 percent of the lounge's gross receipts come
from these sales to non-students.
In addition, the lounge has been selling many
"non-food" items that are not tax-exempt. Among these
are cigarettes and soft drinks.
