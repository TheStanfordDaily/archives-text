# Travel Alternatives
## Opportunities Abroad 
### 
â–  Jeanette Philips

In response to Mark Weaver's
column (Discontinue Overseas Campus
Programs, Daily, Jan. 24), it is true
that Overseas Studies at Stanford are
in the process of re-evaluation as he so
forcefully brought to our attention.
However, there is a considerable range
of alternatives to Stanford's programs
and surprisingly few students are
aware of them.
Also, unbeknown to too many
students is the existence of an office
on campus designed to help students
who want to go abroad and want to
get ideas on how to do it. This is the
Overseas Opportunities Library which
is located in the Bechtel International
Center. This library contains reference
books, pamphlets and announcements
on study, work and travel aborad. 1 am
Overseas Opportunities Adviser and
am available daily to talk with
students about their plans and
generally to assist in any way I can to
help them find the right program. The
alternatives are abundant, but they
cannot be found without effort, just as
a meaningful experience abroad does
not come without determination and a
zest for the unknown.
If Stanford Overseas Studies does
not fit someone's expectations or is
too expensive, here are some other
possibilities.
Instead of trying to do everything,
which may indeed suit some people,
students who want to travel should do
so on their own, perhaps, as Mr.
Weaver suggested. Of course, this takes
a great deal of planning on the part of
the individual who may or may not
have some travel experience already.
Planned carefully, a student can travel
in almost any part of the world much
more inexpensively and with much
more flexibility for travel (if that's the
thing) than the high priced
study/travel combination presented in
an overseas campus.
Indepth Exposure
Traveling alone or in a group still
leaves so much more room for an
indepth exposure to the local culture,
necessitating language facility,
adaptability, resourcefulness and the
desire to confront an exciting
challenge. This will not be an "easy"
experience either. But one will feel
much more a part of the culture eating
in an out of the way cafe with some
native students he or she has met at a
hostel than eating bad American food

at a first class restaurant.
Many other programs offer the
elements of the "ideal" program Mr.
Weaver was talking about. One such
example is Callison College India
Program. Students will live with Indian
students, be taught by an entirely
Indian faculty, and take the same
examinations as their Indian
counterparts thus providing quite a
challenge to the American student. In
a program such as this, you're going to
get a lot for your money compared to
a six month study/travely
once-over-lightly.
Another excellent program for
about half the price of Stanford's is
the University of Massachusetts
Program in Freiburg. Students study at
the University of Freiburg along with
German students and live (as is
customary for all students at the
University of Freiburg) in rented
rooms in the town.
Study In France
Or take for example Alma College's
Program of Studies in France. For
$3200 you can study for a summer
and two semesters with classes to suit
your interests at various colleges in
Paris. There is also a special beginners'
course of intensive French during
which students live in the homes of
French families after which they
participate along with regular students
in advanced level courses.
And these are not the only
programs by any means. There are so
many opportunities for study, each
one different from the last, offering
sound academic experience, cultural
integration and transfer of credit in
Europe and elsewhere.
Many students (myself included)
have designed their own programs
applying directly to foreign
universities, receiving credit here and
living on their own in the foreign
community. And ask these people
what they think of the experience.
They will most likely keep you
listening for hours relating it, how it
changed them,, the incredible time
they had and how they can't wait to
go again.
The point is there are alternatives,
at equal or lower cost to Stanford's.
But for sure there is something for
almost anyone who really wants to go.
