Gurley & Warhaftig

Conventional neoclassical
economics has serious deficiencies, the
most glaring being its distorted
conception of the world we live in. In
developing this point. Paul Sweezy has
written:
"Orthodox economics takes the
existing social system for granted,
much as though it were part of the
natural order of things. Within this
framework it searches for
harmonies of interest among
individuals, classes and nations; it
investigates tendencies toward
equilibrium; and it assumes that
change is gradual and
nondisruptive... .
But the world we live in is not
one of harmonies of interest,
tendencies to equilibrium, and
gradual change. Rather, it is a worid
dominated by conflicts of interest,
tendencies to disequilibrium, and
recurring breaks in the continuity
of development. A would-be
science which starts with a false or
irrelevant conception of reality
cannot yield very significant results,
no matter how refined and
sophisticated its methods might be.
The answers a scientist gets depend,
first and foremost, not on the
methods he uses, but on the
questions he asks. . . .
Orthodox economics has
concerned itself with smaller and
decreasingly significant questions,
even judging magnitude and
significance by its own standards.
To compensate for this
trivialization of content, it has paid
increasing attention to elaborating
and refining its techniques. The
consequence is that today we often
find a truly stupefying gap between
the questions posed and the
techniques employed to answer
them."
Trivia Emphasized
Some of the questions posed by
conventional economists do, of course,
address "important" and "socially
relevant" problems; but the heavy
emphasis placed on technique tends to
draw them not to the most important
social problems, which are often
terribly complex, but to those most
amenable to the application of
techniques at hand, these usually being
rather trivial problems. When
conventional economists do address
themselves to important problems,
they do so through a paradigm that is
such a distortion of reality that their
answers are at best, highly misleading.

Political economics, as
distinguished from conventional
neoclassical economics studies
economic problems by systematically
taking into account, in a historical
context, the pervasiveness of
ruler-subject relations in society.
It is these pervasive relations of
domination and servitude, these
relations of power and authority that
lead to conflict, disharmony and
disruptive change. A political
economist sees these power structures
and builds his analysis upon them; a
conventional economist — who sees
only a society of free, self-interested
economic beings interacting as equals
in the marketplace — does not.
Neutral Technician
The conventional economist,
perceiving harmony of interest almost
everywhere can visualize himself as a
neutral technician, applying his
techniques as objectively as possible.
Ignoring class and group conflict, he
can direct his concerns toward the
poorly defined "general interest."
The political economist turned
radical, on the other hand, not only
studies economic problems within the
historical context of ruler-subject
relations, but actively takes the side of
the poor and the powerless, generally
seeing the system of capitalism as their
oppressor. He believes, therefore, that
the conventional economist not only
fails to consider the relations of power
and authority, and so fails to grasp the
most socially relevant aspects of the
problem, but by being so blind to class
interests and so caught up in data and
technique, he in effect supports a
system that maltreats large numbers of
people.
As Aime Cesaire wrote in Return to
My Native iMnd, "Beware my body
and my soul, beware above all of
crossing your arms and assuming the
sterile attitude of the spectator,
because life is not a spectacle, because
a sea of sorrows is not a proscenium,
because a man who cries out is not a
dancing bear." He is real and must be
heard. Is this so very radical?
