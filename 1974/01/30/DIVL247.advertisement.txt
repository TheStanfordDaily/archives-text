just as comfortable with a soldering iron as
with a slide rule.

as they develop—whether they lead to circuit
design, test engineering, field engineering,
applications engineering or software develop
ment.
.... wants to translate your technical know
ledge into practical, economical solutions to
industrial problems.
.... wants to join a company that is big enough
to offer an engineer the resources he needs
but small enough so that he can make him
self heard.

TERADYNE MAKES SENSE
if you're an ELECTRICAL ENGINEER who
.... loves engineering for its own sake and is
just as comfortable with a soldering iron as
with a slide rule.
.... wants the freedom to follow your interests
as they develop—whether they lead to circuit
design, test engineering, field engineering,
applications engineering or software develop
ment.
.... wants to translate your technical know
ledge into practical, economical solutions to
industrial problems.
.... wants to join a company that is big enough
to offer an engineer the resources he needs
but small enough so that he can make him
self heard.
.... appreciates a fast-growing company that
depends on capable people to keep it growing.
