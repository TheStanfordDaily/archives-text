# KZSU Watt Increases Approved?
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Campus radio station KZSU's
long-standing request for a power
increase has finally gained approval
from the Federal Communications
Commission â€” if an unofficial verbal
message relayed by an FCC secretary
in Washington proves correct.
According to station worker Marty
Rubenstein, the secretary responded
to Rubenstein's Monday phone call by
telling him that the KZSU application
had been cleared by the Broadcast
Bureau.
"If the report is correct, it is very
surprising," said Rubenstein. "The
committee only agreed to rule on the
request some time after the first of the
year, and educational radio stations of
our size have lowest priority in FCC
rulings."
Daryl Dawson, a University lawyer
who has been working on the KZSU
case, said he had tried unsuccessfully
to reach FCC's offices to confirm the
report. "The quickness and
unexpectness of the announcement
leads me to discount its validity," he
stated. "There are many ways that the
secretary could have misread the files
and made a mistake."
The present KZSU application,
originally filed in January of last year,
calls for permission to increase the
station's wattage from 10 to 500. The
FCC agreed last April to consider the
proposal, but an objection by Foothill
Junior College's radio station FKJC
slowed the application's progress.
The nearby Foothill station claimed
that a KZSU power boost would cause
interference with the station's signal in
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Atherton.
KFJC filed a formal objection with the
FCC last summer.
"We can do absolutely nothing
until we have the official telegram
from the FCC," said Assistant Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape, who acts
as a liaison between KZSU and the
University.
Chief station engineer Mark
Lawrence reported that the power
boost would take effect "within a
week or two" after official
confirmation from the FCC. "The
station's signal will become both
stronger and wider-reaching," he
added. "In addition, it will become
much easier to receive the station on
sets using vertical antennae, like most
car radios."
Station Business Manager Lloyd
Snook estimates that the boost will
increase the signal radius from six to
12 miles.
"The report of approval sounds
great; we'd like nothing better than to
start converting to the higher power
right now," stated Rubenstein. "We've
wanted to boost really since spring of
1972. However, since we've received
no official word, we've got to be
surprised by the quickness of this,
which is totally unlike the FCC's usual
pace. Hopefully our lawyer will be
able to confirm the announcement
tomorrow."
