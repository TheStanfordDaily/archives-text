# Alternative To Neoclassical System
## Marxian Economics Program Requested 
### 
(This is the first of a two-part series. The conclusion
will appear tomorrow on this page.)
On Friday at 2:30 p.m. in Tresidder 270,
undergraduates will meet to discuss the limited
offerings in Marxian economics. Student input into
the discussion has been the significant factor in the
department's consideration of the matter. In spring,
1972 after several student petitions, the Workshop
in Political Economy, which had been meeting
without recognition, was finally awarded graduate
seminar status. It soon became evident that stiious
work demanded more formal course preparation at
all levels.
Another year's planning by both students and
Prof. Gurley (and later Prof. Harris) culminated in a
graduate sequence, "Traditions of Economic
Analysis." But this remains experimental in the
department's eyes. Continuing the field and adding
more courses depends on hiring additional faculty
working in the Marxist tradition. This will happen
only if student interest remains high and continues
to grow in the strength with which it is expressed.
Marxian economics offers an approach to the
study of economic and social questions differing in
its foundations from the established neoclassical
system. Not merely a separate field, it is an
alternative form of analysis. It is neither an ideology
nor a religion, but rather an internally-consistent
paradigm which depends on rigorous thinking and
informed construction of hypotheses. Despite the
last two decades of massive economic research in
the U.S. devoted almost exclusively to the
neoclassical model, the events of the last few years
have shown orthodox economics to remain less than
adequate.
In a hostile atmosphere that gave indications of
the impending dismemberment of the program in
Traditions of Economic Analysis and Political
Economy, Stanford URPE (Union for Radical
Political Economics) submitted petitions in Dec.
1973 from hundreds of students and faculty asking
the department to commit itself to: (1) formalize a
program in Marxian and radical political economy;
(2) maintain a total of three faculty appointments
in the area at the full, associate, and assistant levels;

(3) adopt a policy of filling gaps with visiting
scholars likewise working in and sympathetic to the
Marxist tradition; (4) immediately include such
individuals in its schedule of hiring interviews.
Establish Marxian Program
These requests have one common purpose â€” the
establishment at Stanford of a program in Marxian
economics adequate at all levels to meet the existing
student interest and vigorous enough to stimulate
rigorous research. The response within the
community has been unprecedented. The Graduate
Student Association and the department
co-sponsored an open meeting two weeks ago to
discuss the proposals and an audience of 130
jammed the room. Last Friday, a faculty meeting
continued the deliberations. Amidst all this
commotion, a number of clear issues have emerged.
'Political Criteria?'
In the Daily (Jan. 25), Prof. M. Abramowitz,
chairman of the department, repeated his judgment
that the hiring criterion "working in and
sympathetic to the Marxist tradition" was
"dangerous" because of its political implications. He
has modeled the present hiring policy as a "search
for the brightest young men."
If intelligent students continue to become
Marxist scholars, they can hope to seep into this and
other departments in the normal course of affairs.
But this "osmosis" theory is a misrepresentation of
reality. In fact, faculty (hopefully, women as well as
men) are recruited to satisfy previously established
priorities. The fact that the only tenured Marxian
economists ever present at Stanford have been
"conversions" is persuasive evidence that when
personnel are sought, the assumption is that they
will be safely within the vogue (neoclassical general
equilibrium theory).
Inconsistencies
Asking for teachers "working in and sympathetic
to the Marxist tradition" is no more and no less
political than searching for staff working in and
sympathetic to human capital theory, new
economic history, or general equilibrium. The
Economics Department has never shown itself
averse to these priorities.

Lynam & Wechsler

Some years back, when the late Paul Baran (a
Marxist) was teaching here, some alumni after
failing to have him dismissed sought to establish a
chair in "conservative economics." Unlike the
Marxist model, this queer animal is strictly
ideological in definition as it is distinct from
neoclassical economics in neither methodology nor
substantive positive statements. Yet the department
gave serious consideration to it for over a year
during which at least one formal offer was made.
By contrast, the URPE-orlginated requests apply
thoroughly objective standards. We seek faculty
working with such concepts as the labor theory of
value, class, historical materialism, etc.
Neoclassical Assumptions
All this does not deny the element of ideology in
the entire gamut of economic theory. Neoclassical
economics is built upon such assumptions as
unlimited individual greed ("non-satiation").
Exploitation does not exist as everyone is paid their
just marginal products. Questions of capitalism's
origin and laws of motion go unexplained. Given the
social and economic order in the United Staes, is it
any wonder why the government and economic
establishment are more comfortable with the
neoclassical paradigm than the Marxian one?
We are not suggesting that the majority of
economists do not seek to approach their work with
a scientific attitude. But one's initial vision of the
world colors the choice of questions that seem
important. Both models are capable of scientific
investigation. Wouldn't the consideration of all
propositions in both traditions be much more alert
if it included the exacting critique provided by
non-believers?
Some faculty members feel they have seriously
considered Marxian economics and rejected it on
intellectual grounds. Given the lack of formal
attention this approach receives in American
universities, we are forced to skepticism about the
strength of these grounds.

graduate students in the Food Research Institute
and the Economics Department, respectively. Both
are members of Stanford URPE.)
