# Reply To Ottilie
## A 						President Can Violate The Law Too 
### 
Bob Ottilie's column, published in the Jan. 28
Daily, provided a needed contrast to the anti-Nixon
diatribes that have long pervaded the editorial pages
of this paper. But unfortunately, Ottilie committed
several errors in fact and reasoning which undermine
his argument.
By contending that much of the motivation for
Nixon's impeachment is political in origin, he
implies that only legal offenses should provide cause
for the removal of the president. This is a cogent
point, but it is later mocked when Ottilie goes on to
defend Nixon's record in office — as if his
accomplishments should somehow cancel the effect
of possible violations of the law.
This curious reasoning is perpetuated when
Ottilie states that the majority of Americans oppose
impeachment. Is he advocating government by
opinion poll? The very polls that he quotes show
also that 70 percent of Americans believe that
Nixon is guilty of some illegal acts. Does this prove
his guilt? The surveys also show that Americans are
almost equally divided on the issue of resignation.
Does it follow that a shift of a couple of percentage
points in favor of resignation should persuade hte
president to step down?
Whatever the answer, his statistics can be
challenged. He cites a Gallup Poll showing a 53-36
division against impeachment, but a recent Roper
survey, quoted in National Observer shows a 45-44
break opposing impeachment.
Later, Ottilie states that "we can remember the
mishandling of the Bay of Pigs invasion and the
Cuban Missile crisis that left a Communist
government 90 miles from our border." This seems
to imply that the Castro government dates from a
Democratic administration. In reality, Castro took
power in 1959 while Eisenhower was president.
Diplomatic relations with Cuba had already been
severed by the time he left office.
What bearing all this has on Watergate is difficult
to determine. Ottilie cites the Bay of Pigs as an
example of Democratic incompetence. I could
mention the U-2 incident as an example of
Republican mistakes, and he could reply by
mentioning Truman's errors. But all of this would

be irrelevant to the current scandals in Washington.
In a shocking paragraph, Ottilie declares that
"energetic leaders were assassinated in their prime"
during Democratic administrations, and mentions
U.S. Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell along
with Martin King and the Kennedys. While his point
— that any killing is tragic — is a good observation,
his particular juxtaposition of Rockwell's name
seems in poor taste.
In possibly the most invalid portion of his
discourse, Ottilie commits the post hoc ergo propter
hoc fallacy by blaming President Johnson's
administration for the riots and crime that occurred
during the Democratic incumbency. Disregarding
the fact that such disturbances continued well into
the Nixon years, how can Ottilie possibly divine any
causal connection between Johnson's presidency
and such events? A president is not omnipotent. He
cannot be blamed for every sordid event that
happens to take place while he is in office.
Ottilie rightly lauds Nixon for stopping the
killing of Americans in Southeast Asia, but he fails
to mention that it took Nixon four years to reach a
settlement, and that the death of Asians has
continued unabated.
Quoting U.S. News and World Report, he states
that the real incomes of Americans has increased in
the last decade. But early in January, the same
magazine ran an article claiming that the real
incomes of such groups as pensioners and factory
workers has drastically declined in recent (Nixon)
years.
Finally, Ottilie blasts the "liberal" press (who
would such people as Ottilie blame without the
liberal press?) and hints the possibility of
conspiracy. I would like to have him explain why
Joseph Alsop, a venerable spokesman for
conservatism, has urged Nixon's resignation. Why
has Kevin Phillips, formerly a profusely articulate
prophet of Nixon's "New Majority," publically
declared himself betrayed? Why has James
Kirkpatrick, a conservative's conservative, called for
Nixon's impeachment? Indeed I would now regard
Nixon, his sycophantic aides, and subjective
followers, as the nation's radicals, and label most of

Bill Ross

his detractors as "conservative" (i.e., favoring a
return to the rule of law).
While Ottilie is correct in stating that Nixon has
never been proven guilty, the evidence against him is
now almost overwhelming. While I do not advocate
"trial by press" and would not presume to make a
final determination of his guilt or innocence, I
believe that persistent discussion of the matter is
necessary if Americans are to preserve any concern
about the integrity of their elected officials.
Ottilie is right to remind us that Nixon has some
admirable accomplishments to his credit, especially
in the area of foreign policy. But this should not
blind us to the very real possibility that the highest
officer in the land may have been involved in
violations of the law. And "killing the messenger"
of the news won't remedy any problems.

killing of Americans in Southeast Asia, but he fails
to mention that it took Nixon four years to reach a
settlement, and that the death of Asians has
continued unabated.
Quoting U.S. News and World Report, he states
that the real incomes of Americans has increased in
the last decade. But early in January, the same
magazine ran an article claiming that the real
incomes of such groups as pensioners and factory
workers has drastically declined in recent (Nixon)
years.
Finally, Ottilie blasts the "liberal" press (who
would such people as Ottilie blame without the
liberal press?) and hints the possibility of
conspiracy. I would like to have him explain why
Joseph Alsop, a venerable spokesman for
conservatism, has urged Nixon's resignation. Why
has Kevin Phillips, formerly a profusely articulate
prophet of Nixon's "New Majority," publically
declared himself betrayed? Why has James
Kirkpatrick, a conservative's conservative, called for
Nixon's impeachment? Indeed I would now regard
Nixon, his sycophantic aides, and subjective
followers, as the nation's radicals, and label most of

Bill Ross

his detractors as "conservative" (i.e., favoring a
return to the rule of law).
While Ottilie is correct in stating that Nixon has
never been proven guilty, the evidence against him is
now almost overwhelming. While I do not advocate
"trial by press" and would not presume to make a
final determination of his guilt or innocence, I
believe that persistent discussion of the matter is
necessary if Americans are to preserve any concern
about the integrity of their elected officials.
Ottilie is right to remind us that Nixon has some
admirable accomplishments to his credit, especially
in the area of foreign policy. But this should not
blind us to the very real possibility that the highest
officer in the land may have been involved in
violations of the law. And "killing the messenger"
of the news won't remedy any problems.

Bob Ottilie's column, published in the Jan. 28
Daily, provided a needed contrast to the anti-Nixon
diatribes that have long pervaded the editorial pages
of this paper. But unfortunately, Ottilie committed
several errors in fact and reasoning which undermine
his argument.
By contending that much of the motivation for
Nixon's impeachment is political in origin, he
implies that only legal offenses should provide cause
for the removal of the president. This is a cogent
point, but it is later mocked when Ottilie goes on to
defend Nixon's record in office — as if his
accomplishments should somehow cancel the effect
of possible violations of the law.
This curious reasoning is perpetuated when
Ottilie states that the majority of Americans oppose
impeachment. Is he advocating government by
opinion poll? The very polls that he quotes show
also that 70 percent of Americans believe that
Nixon is guilty of some illegal acts. Does this prove
his guilt? The surveys also show that Americans are
almost equally divided on the issue of resignation.
Does it follow that a shift of a couple of percentage
points in favor of resignation should persuade hte
president to step down?
Whatever the answer, his statistics can be
challenged. He cites a Gallup Poll showing a 53-36
division against impeachment, but a recent Roper
survey, quoted in National Observer shows a 45-44
break opposing impeachment.
Later, Ottilie states that "we can remember the
mishandling of the Bay of Pigs invasion and the
Cuban Missile crisis that left a Communist
government 90 miles from our border." This seems
to imply that the Castro government dates from a
Democratic administration. In reality, Castro took
power in 1959 while Eisenhower was president.
Diplomatic relations with Cuba had already been
severed by the time he left office.
What bearing all this has on Watergate is difficult
to determine. Ottilie cites the Bay of Pigs as an
example of Democratic incompetence. I could
mention the U-2 incident as an example of
Republican mistakes, and he could reply by
mentioning Truman's errors. But all of this would

be irrelevant to the current scandals in Washington.
In a shocking paragraph, Ottilie declares that
"energetic leaders were assassinated in their prime"
during Democratic administrations, and mentions
U.S. Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell along
with Martin King and the Kennedys. While his point
— that any killing is tragic — is a good observation,
his particular juxtaposition of Rockwell's name
seems in poor taste.
In possibly the most invalid portion of his
discourse, Ottilie commits the post hoc ergo propter
hoc fallacy by blaming President Johnson's
administration for the riots and crime that occurred
during the Democratic incumbency. Disregarding
the fact that such disturbances continued well into
the Nixon years, how can Ottilie possibly divine any
causal connection between Johnson's presidency
and such events? A president is not omnipotent. He
cannot be blamed for every sordid event that
happens to take place while he is in office.

president to step down?
Whatever the answer, his statistics can be
challenged. He cites a Gallup Poll showing a 53-36
division against impeachment, but a recent Roper
survey, quoted in National Observer shows a 45-44
break opposing impeachment.
Later, Ottilie states that "we can remember the
mishandling of the Bay of Pigs invasion and the
Cuban Missile crisis that left a Communist
government 90 miles from our border." This seems
to imply that the Castro government dates from a
Democratic administration. In reality, Castro took
power in 1959 while Eisenhower was president.
Diplomatic relations with Cuba had already been
severed by the time he left office.
What bearing all this has on Watergate is difficult
to determine. Ottilie cites the Bay of Pigs as an
example of Democratic incompetence. I could
mention the U-2 incident as an example of
Republican mistakes, and he could reply by
mentioning Truman's errors. But all of this would

be irrelevant to the current scandals in Washington.
In a shocking paragraph, Ottilie declares that
"energetic leaders were assassinated in their prime"
during Democratic administrations, and mentions
U.S. Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell along
with Martin King and the Kennedys. While his point
— that any killing is tragic — is a good observation,
his particular juxtaposition of Rockwell's name
seems in poor taste.
In possibly the most invalid portion of his
discourse, Ottilie commits the post hoc ergo propter
hoc fallacy by blaming President Johnson's
administration for the riots and crime that occurred
during the Democratic incumbency. Disregarding
the fact that such disturbances continued well into
the Nixon years, how can Ottilie possibly divine any
causal connection between Johnson's presidency
and such events? A president is not omnipotent. He
cannot be blamed for every sordid event that
happens to take place while he is in office.
Ottilie rightly lauds Nixon for stopping the
killing of Americans in Southeast Asia, but he fails
to mention that it took Nixon four years to reach a
settlement, and that the death of Asians has
continued unabated.
Quoting U.S. News and World Report, he states
that the real incomes of Americans has increased in
the last decade. But early in January, the same
magazine ran an article claiming that the real
incomes of such groups as pensioners and factory
workers has drastically declined in recent (Nixon)
years.
Finally, Ottilie blasts the "liberal" press (who
would such people as Ottilie blame without the
liberal press?) and hints the possibility of
conspiracy. I would like to have him explain why
Joseph Alsop, a venerable spokesman for
conservatism, has urged Nixon's resignation. Why
has Kevin Phillips, formerly a profusely articulate
prophet of Nixon's "New Majority," publically
declared himself betrayed? Why has James
Kirkpatrick, a conservative's conservative, called for
Nixon's impeachment? Indeed I would now regard
Nixon, his sycophantic aides, and subjective
followers, as the nation's radicals, and label most of

Bill Ross

his detractors as "conservative" (i.e., favoring a
return to the rule of law).
While Ottilie is correct in stating that Nixon has
never been proven guilty, the evidence against him is
now almost overwhelming. While I do not advocate
"trial by press" and would not presume to make a
final determination of his guilt or innocence, I
believe that persistent discussion of the matter is
necessary if Americans are to preserve any concern
about the integrity of their elected officials.
Ottilie is right to remind us that Nixon has some
admirable accomplishments to his credit, especially
in the area of foreign policy. But this should not
blind us to the very real possibility that the highest
officer in the land may have been involved in
violations of the law. And "killing the messenger"
of the news won't remedy any problems.

Bob Ottilie's column, published in the Jan. 28
Daily, provided a needed contrast to the anti-Nixon
diatribes that have long pervaded the editorial pages
of this paper. But unfortunately, Ottilie committed
several errors in fact and reasoning which undermine
his argument.
By contending that much of the motivation for
Nixon's impeachment is political in origin, he
implies that only legal offenses should provide cause
for the removal of the president. This is a cogent
point, but it is later mocked when Ottilie goes on to
defend Nixon's record in office — as if his
accomplishments should somehow cancel the effect
of possible violations of the law.
This curious reasoning is perpetuated when
Ottilie states that the majority of Americans oppose
impeachment. Is he advocating government by
opinion poll? The very polls that he quotes show
also that 70 percent of Americans believe that
Nixon is guilty of some illegal acts. Does this prove
his guilt? The surveys also show that Americans are
almost equally divided on the issue of resignation.
