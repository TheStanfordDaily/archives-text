# CONTRIBUTIONS TO DAILY OPINIONS PAGE
## 
### 
The Daily welcomes contributions from its
readers for the opinions page. All letters and
columns must be typed on a 62-space line,
double spaced. For columns, type a
maximum of 70 lines; for letters, 45 lines.
Any copy submitted longer will have to be
cut â€” and we prefer that you cut it before
you bring it to us. Material submitted for the
opinions page will be selected for clarity,
coherence, insight, and pertinence.
