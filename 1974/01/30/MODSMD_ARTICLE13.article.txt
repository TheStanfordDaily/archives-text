# Slade, Others Too Loud

### GEORGE POWELL 
SAN FRANCISCO — It was rock and roll at
ear-splitting volume at Winterland Saturday night,
with three of the loudest groups this side of early
Led Zepplin or Black Sabbath "getting down" into
the range of primal scream and throbbing drums.
Brownsville Station, the James Gang and Slade
were there to set your ears on end, and in that
endeavor they succeeded. Enjoyable music should
be more than gut-chuming bass and heavy
repetitive riffs from the lead guitar. But that's
about all that the James Gang and Brownsville
Station offered.
Led by vocalist Cub Koda's pleas for the
audience to get into a party spirit, Brownsville
Station came on like a 747 with engine trouble,
doing a wham-bam version of Jerry Lee Lewis'
"Drinkin' Wine Spo-de-o-de" which made the
eardrums throb, but was almost unrecognizable
otherwise.
Throughout the half hour set, Koda and bassist
Mike Lutz strutted across the stage, traded Peter
Townshend-style leaps, and tried to make the
audience feel obligated to "boogie."
AM Hit Rendition
They did a sloppy version of their AM hit,
"Smokin' In The Boys' Room" and earned an
encore mostly by their frenetic posturing, with
19505-style guitar riffs getting a heavy metal
treatment, while Koda made like he was warming
up a TV quiz show audience for the cameras.
The encore was the best number Brownsville
Station did, an exact cover of the MCs's version of
"Ramblin' Rose." Bassist Lutz ended the
presentation by leaping from the 10-foot high
speakers onto the stage.
During the break, while ears resonated, the
closed-circuit television showed Mick Jagger singing
"Angie" and other tunes from the Rolling Stone's
newest album. But that was only a momentary

respite. On came the James Gang, who seemed to
be caught somewhere between their Kent State
origins and early San Francisco psychedelia. The
quartet featured three guitarists and a drummer,
two gongs and a sophisticated wah-wah box to
make a guitar sound like a jet plane, an endless
echo, a machine gun or anything else which might
cover for the group's lack of imagination and
innovation.
Wall of Noise
Boring, overly loud guitar riffs and flashing
lights on the group's speakers couldn't make up for
the cacophonous sound — more like a wall of noise
than anything else. They finally got together on the
encore "Rol! Over Beethoven," which was more
coherent than the half-baked early psychedelia the
group had opened with.
By now, everyone's ears were shattered enough
for Slade, an English supergroup that has never
made it in America. They are an amazingly loud
and tight quartet, but after two gutslammer bands
proceeding them, this reviewer's ears had just about
had an evening's quota of skull-cracking rock and
roll.
Interesting Vocal Style
Noddy Holder, Slade's lead singer, had an
interesting vocal style that was backed by a ballsy
bass and rhythm guitar and pulsating drums.
The arrangements were short, crisp and
mind-boggling in loudness, with Holder, looking
like a fleshed-out lan Anderson,making good useof
his voice and a mirrored top hat, which reflected a
spotlight trained on his head in a hypnotic sort of
lighted circle.
Loud music is fine for a while, but a triple bill
topped by Slade is too much of a beating for ears
to absorb in one evening. Winterland's prices are
high enough, without having your ears sonically
crushed in the bargain.
