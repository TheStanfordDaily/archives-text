# Benson Heads Fine Quartet
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - One of
the most talented young jazz
guitarists in the country, George
Benson, ended a six-night
engagement Sunday at Keystone
Korner.
Having served as a sideman for
several years with people like

trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and
organist Brother Jack McDuff,
Benson now heads an extremely
fine quartet, consisting of bass,
drums, and two guitarists.
Playing second guitar behind
Benson might be somewhat like
being a second-string drummer in
the Buddy Rich Band. But, in this

case, 19-year-old classical guitarist
Earl Klugh was so unique as to
discourage comparison of the two
styles.
Klugh played two pieces alone,
including the Carpenters' "For All
We Know," with Benson listening
and smiling respectfully.
Wide Selection
Benson's selections ranged
from funky, soul-influenced tunes
to flamenco-flavored numbers.
The influence of the late Wes
Montgomery was readily apparent
in Benson's playing. Most of his
lead breaks were built from
chords and octaves, with only
occasional single note runs.
Benson has the reputation of
being the fastest jazz guitarist in
the world, and rightfully so. But,
this should not over-shadow his
outstanding composing and all
around creativity.
Guitar-Vocal Interplay
The real show stopper
Saturday night came when Benson
sang Gershwin's "Summertime,"
with some mind-blowing
guitar-voice exchanges.
Benson's impressive rhythm
unit consisted of David Parrish on
drums, and Ron Chandler on
electric bass.
In the coming weeks, Keystone
Korner, 750 Vallejo, will bring
some fine jazz artists, such as
Hubert Laws, Eddie Harris, and
Rahsaan Roland Kirk. For
information, phone 781-0697.
