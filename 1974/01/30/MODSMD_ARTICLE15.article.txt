# RENAISSANCE HIGH MASS
## 
### 
Listener and worshiper alike
will share in the experience of
a Renaissance solemn high
mass commemorating the
500 th anniversary year of the
death of composer Guillaume
Dufay (1400-1474) in
Memorial Church on Saturday,
February 2, at 8:30 p.m.
William Mahrt of the Stanford
Music Department will direct
the Stanford Early Music
Singers in Dufay's Missa Ave
Regina Coelorum. In addition,
the choir of St. Ann Chapel,
Palo Alto, will provide
Gregorian chant for the Latin
service.
The blessing of candles and
a procession of lights will
precede the mass celebrating
Candlemas, or the Feast of the
Purification, which occurs
forty days after Christmas.
This event marks the
presentation of Jesus in the

Temple and the ritual
purification of Mary after
childbirth. At that time
Simeon proclaimed Christ "a
light to lighten the Gentiles" in
the canticle, Nunc Dimittis.
This cinquecentennial
performance — a rare musical
occurrence in itself — closely
approximates the liturgical
context for which the Missa
Ave Regina Coelorum was
written. The sixteen voices of
the Early Music Singers
comprise a characteristic choral
ensemble size for the early
Renaissance, but with women
and falsettists replacing
choirboys on the treble lines.
The spacious acoustics of
Memorial Church complement
the intricate lines of Dufay's
music, which, though rarely
performed today, was
reknowned in its own time for
its rich sonorities.
