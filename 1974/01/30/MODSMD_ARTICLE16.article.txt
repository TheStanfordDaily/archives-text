# Mikado' To Benefit CAR Center
## 
### 
The San Francisco
Lamplighters will perform Gilbert
and Sullivan's operetta The
Mikado this Sunday, Feb. 3, at
Cupertino's Flint Center. The
performance is a benefit for the
Palo Alto Community Association
for Retarded, Inc. (CAR).
The CAR is a Palo Alto-based
group of volunteers and
professionals "teamed together to
help retarded and handicapped
people in our community reach
toward a richer, more rounded
life." CAR programs include care
of preschool-age mentally
retarded children, creative
recreation for elementary-age and
older children, longer-term respite
care, a swim program for persons

with physical mental or emotional
handicaps, and a weekend adult
program.
The lamplighters are the Bay
Area's resident Gilbert and
Sullivan repertory company. This
production of The Mikado,
featured in their 1973 San
Francisco season, achieved great
critical success. This will be the
company's first South Peninsula
appearance in several years.
This performance of The
Mikado is the Lamplighters' first
benefit for the CAR, but both
groups hope to continue the
association. There are plans for an
annual benefit show, with The
Merry Widow scheduled for next
year.
