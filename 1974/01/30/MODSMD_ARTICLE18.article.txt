# Sugarcane Possible Fuel Source
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Sugarcane could be man's next primary supply of fuel energy,
according to Nobel laureate Melvin Calvin, director of U.C.-Berkeley's
Laboratory of Chemical Biodynamics.
Speaking to a capacity crowd in the Skilling Lecture Theater on
"Solar Energy: The Outlook for Photosynthesis," Calvin said, "The
plant that has the highest efficiency of photosynthesis over a year
period is sugarcane."
The carbohydrate in sugar can most efficiently be changed into
energy by converting it to fuel alcohol, a process which costs
approximately 84 cents per gallon of alcohol, according to Calvin,
who belongs to the National Science Foundation and the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
With petroleum and other energy-source prices rising at rapid rates,
sugarcane conversion could become feasible soon, "if it is not
already," according to Calvin, who earned his bachelor's and Sc.D.
degrees at the Michigan College of Mining and Technology, and his
Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota.
Calvin also mentioned the hevea rubber plant as a possible energy
source, because it is not necessary to change the plant in order to
obtain fuel. The plant takes solar energy and converts it directly into
the hydrocarbons necessary for fuel.
Besides these two plants which collecte solar energy naturally,
Calvin also stressed two technological ways of collecting solar
radiation and converting it to energy.
Both these photochemical means of converting solar energy, still in
the planning stages, are attempts "to use some concepts that have
been generated by photosynthesis research," he said.
Calvin said, "If we could simulate some of these processes of
photosynthesis by synthetic methods, we might be able to produce
energy in still another way."
Based on what is known about photosynthesis, one of these
processes, according to Calvin, calls for direct photochemical
conversion of the quantum into useful energy in the form of
hydrogen.
Another totally synthetic system which simulates photo-plasmic
membrane activity would generage electrical current, However, some
of the discoveries necessary for this process have yet to be made.
Calvin received the 1961 Nobel Prize for his use of carbon-14 to
clarify the chemical reactions that take place during photosynthesis.
