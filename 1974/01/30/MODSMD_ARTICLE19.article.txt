## Thanks To Billie Jean... 
### Don Tollefson 
Back in the mid-60s, when they were still
affiliated with San Francisco, the Warriors used to
offer two tickets for the price of one to anyone
who sent in a wrapper from a certain brand of hot
dogs. Despite the giveaway, there were many nights
when the 6500 seats of the Civic Auditorium were
far from full.
But two weekends ago, there wasn't an empty
seat in the house for two nights in a row, and Rick
Barry was nowhere in sight. The bouncing ball was
small and white and the athletes were all women.
As Billie Jean King said, "I've waited 20 years to
see crowds like this."
These crowds were far larger than the ones
which turned out in Cleveland in November to see
the Australian Davis Cup team whip the American
men's team 5-0 and reclaim the Cup which the U.S.
had held since 1968. And now that Colombia has
eliminated the U.S. from this year's Davis Cup
competition in a humiliating upset, the current
state of American's men's tennis is tainted
considerably.
As far as women's tennis is concerned, the Davis
Cup debacle couldn't have occurred at a better
time. Ever since King silenced Sugar Daddy Riggs in
September in front of the largest audience a tennis
match has ever had, women's tennis has received
the kind of publicity women's athletics has been
unjustly deprived of for so long. And the picture
gets brighter all the time.
Fifth On Money List
Beating Riggs put King at the top of the
women's tennis world in the eyes of most casual
observers, but surprisngly, King was only the fifth
leading money winner in women's tournament play
last year, with $69,675. Ironically, after tarnishing
her image with a Mother's Day loss to Riggs in the
first "Battle of the Sexes," Australian Margaret
Court went on to break all money records by
winning $180,058 in tournament play last year.
Her total would have placed her third among all
men players last year, but on the whole, women
still earned considerably less than men last year.
The top 10 women earned $793,649, while the top
ten men won $1,439,875.
It is unfortunate that after having a phenomenal
year, Court will be remembered most for losing to
the same hustler King so handily beat. But tennis
experts will not minimize the fact that Court won
the Australian, French and U.S. Opens and an
incredible 100 of 104 matches.
King did win Wimbledon last year in a victory
that received considerable additional publicity due
to the men's boycott, but over the year, she still
lost three of four matches to Court. By the end of
the year, King found herself dropped from No. 1 to

No. 3, while Court moved to the top spot from No.
4.
The new year got off to a good start for King in
the aforementioned San Francisco stop on the
Virginia Slims tour when she defeated Chris Evert
in the finals 7-6, 6-2. But the 19-year old Evert,
who won an amazing $142,949 last year, avenged
that defeat last weekend when she beat King 6-3,
6-1 in another Virginia Slims event.
Despite being moved from the top of the
rankings, King is still the leading figure and
spokeswoman for her sport. And it is her
off-the-court activities which may be more
important for the future of women's tennis and all
women's athletics. Without a doubt, King is one of
the most articulate of all athletes.
"We don't want to compete against men. We just
want the opportunity to get into sports programs at
all levels... . The only way I made it in tennis was
by chance. My family didn't participate. I wanted a
sport where I could still be considered feminine.
That hasn't been easy. Hopefully, no longer are we
regarded as musclebound, Amazonian jerks.
"The growth of the game has been phenomenal,
but tennis has a long way to go. The game is caught
up in tradition, trivia and etiquette, when all that
really matters is the calibre of play. We need to
move away from our clubby, rich and white
atmosphere and touch the masses. We need more
color, more noise, a better scoring system and
improved officiating."
New Magazine
One of the most important ventures ever
undertaken in women's athletics is the new Women
Sports Magazine King and her husband are
producing, which is scheduled to debut in June.
That magazine should finally provide some
long-overdue mass exposure for women athletes
and perhaps it will even enlighten some members of
the male sportswriting subculture.
Although she is a leading spokeswomen for both
women athletes and women in general, King never
practices the kind of strident cant her fellow pro
Rosie Casals demonstrated in the telecast of the
King-Riggs match.
Even King admits that Casals went too far. "I
thought Rosie came on a bit strong, especially
toward the end. It was a mistake, I think, to keep
knocking Bobby once the match began to swing
against him."
Women's athletics is still far from its rightful
place in our society, but women's tennis, and
especially King's performance on and off the court,
has done much to improve the situation. The entire
sports world owes her considerable gratitude.
