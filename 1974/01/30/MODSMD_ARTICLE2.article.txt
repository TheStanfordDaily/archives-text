# Traffic Plans Under Debate
## Stanford, Palo Alto To Seek Solutions 
### BILL ROSS 
Any plan for reduction of College
Terrace traffic adopted by the Palo
Alto City Council should avoid
diverting extra traffic onto the
Stanford campus, according to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs, and a
member of the Stanford-Palo Alto
Liaison Committee.
The problem of College Terrace
traffic will be discussed tonight at
7:30 at an open forum at Lucille
Nixon School, 1711 Stanford Ave.
Liaison Committee members will
attend the meeting in order to better
gauge public opinion.
The City Council, beleaguered by a
proliferation of plans for the reduction
of traffic on the Terrace, called
tonight's meeting and asked the
Liaison Committee to study the
matter so that all opinions will be
considered before a decision is
reached.
Numerous residents of the College
Terrace have requested that blockades
be erected on key intersections to
reduce traffic in the area. Stanford
students and employees have
complained that such plans would
make access to Stanford unreasonably
difficult.
"This is an issue that involves both
the University and the city, and thus it
is proper that the Liaison Committee
explore it," Lyons said. "But the
University at first had reservations
about having the committee discuss it.
We must be careful that the committee
doesn't become another layer of
government. We can't make any
decisions, but we can try to examine
the issues objectively."
The City Council might have
accepted a plan for a solution of the
problem at its Jan. 14 meeting, but a

group of Escondido Village residents
asked that the matter be postponed,
according to Susie Tilson, president of
the Escondido Village Council.
Escondido Village and College
Terrace residents are united in their
desire to retain open access to the
Stanford campus, Tilson said. Thus, a
chance exists for an amicable solution
that will reduce traffic in the Terrace
while keeping access to the University
open.
"There is definitely an
unreasonable burden of traffic on
College Terrace," stated Ted Noguchi,
Palo Alto city traffic engineer. "The
City Council and the residents of
College Terrace agree that there is a
problem, as confirmed by statistics
that show the volume of traffic on
many streets is several times heavier
than it should be."
In response to charges that barriers
set up by the city in September have
been ineffective in reducing traffic,
Noguchi contended that some
improvement has taken place.
"We established the existing
barriers because we believed that they
would have the least impact on
residents and the maximum effect on
reducing traffic. We wanted to
preserve neighborhood access to as
many streets as possible and yet
prevent aliens from entering the area.
It was difficult to balance the
conflicting factors. We tried to be as
unbiased as possible."
Attempts to keep cars from other
neighborhood streets bordering
College Terrace are unnecessary,
Noguchi said. While 80 percent of the
traffic in the Terrace is non-resident
traffic, only 7'/2 percent of alien traffic
comes from the neighboring areas of
Pine Hill and Frenchman's Hill, he
explained.
College Terrace and those areas
have mutual concerns, he said. For
example, children from both Pine Hill
and College Terrace attend the Lucille
Nixon School, and Terrace children go

to school with Escondido Village
children at Escondido School.
Although the county has installed
stoplights at Romundo and Stanford
Avenues, and at Peter Coutts Road
and Stanford Avenue, there is still a
danger for school children crossing the
busy streets in the Terrace area,
Noguchi said. Consequently, many
residents see traffic reduction as a
particularly crucial problem.
"People don't disagree with the
intent of the various plans that have
been suggested but rather with the
manner in which they have been
constructed," Noguchi concluded.

about having the committee discuss it.
We must be careful that the committee
doesn't become another layer of
government. We can't make any
decisions, but we can try to examine
the issues objectively."
The City Council might have
accepted a plan for a solution of the
problem at its Jan. 14 meeting, but a

group of Escondido Village residents
asked that the matter be postponed,
according to Susie Tilson, president of
the Escondido Village Council.
Escondido Village and College
Terrace residents are united in their
desire to retain open access to the
Stanford campus, Tilson said. Thus, a
chance exists for an amicable solution
that will reduce traffic in the Terrace
while keeping access to the University
open.
"There is definitely an
unreasonable burden of traffic on
College Terrace," stated Ted Noguchi,
Palo Alto city traffic engineer. "The
City Council and the residents of
College Terrace agree that there is a
problem, as confirmed by statistics
that show the volume of traffic on
many streets is several times heavier
than it should be."
In response to charges that barriers
set up by the city in September have
been ineffective in reducing traffic,
Noguchi contended that some
improvement has taken place.
"We established the existing
barriers because we believed that they
would have the least impact on
residents and the maximum effect on
reducing traffic. We wanted to
preserve neighborhood access to as
many streets as possible and yet
prevent aliens from entering the area.
It was difficult to balance the
conflicting factors. We tried to be as
unbiased as possible."
Attempts to keep cars from other
neighborhood streets bordering
College Terrace are unnecessary,
Noguchi said. While 80 percent of the
traffic in the Terrace is non-resident
traffic, only 7'/2 percent of alien traffic
comes from the neighboring areas of
Pine Hill and Frenchman's Hill, he
explained.
College Terrace and those areas
have mutual concerns, he said. For
example, children from both Pine Hill
and College Terrace attend the Lucille
Nixon School, and Terrace children go

to school with Escondido Village
children at Escondido School.
Although the county has installed
stoplights at Romundo and Stanford
Avenues, and at Peter Coutts Road
and Stanford Avenue, there is still a
danger for school children crossing the
busy streets in the Terrace area,
Noguchi said. Consequently, many
residents see traffic reduction as a
particularly crucial problem.
"People don't disagree with the
intent of the various plans that have
been suggested but rather with the
manner in which they have been
constructed," Noguchi concluded.

Any plan for reduction of College
Terrace traffic adopted by the Palo
Alto City Council should avoid
diverting extra traffic onto the
Stanford campus, according to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs, and a
member of the Stanford-Palo Alto
Liaison Committee.
The problem of College Terrace
traffic will be discussed tonight at
7:30 at an open forum at Lucille
Nixon School, 1711 Stanford Ave.
Liaison Committee members will
attend the meeting in order to better
gauge public opinion.
The City Council, beleaguered by a
proliferation of plans for the reduction
of traffic on the Terrace, called
tonight's meeting and asked the
Liaison Committee to study the
matter so that all opinions will be
considered before a decision is
reached.
Numerous residents of the College
Terrace have requested that blockades
be erected on key intersections to
reduce traffic in the area. Stanford
students and employees have
complained that such plans would
make access to Stanford unreasonably
difficult.
"This is an issue that involves both
the University and the city, and thus it
is proper that the Liaison Committee
explore it," Lyons said. "But the
University at first had reservations
about having the committee discuss it.
We must be careful that the committee
doesn't become another layer of
