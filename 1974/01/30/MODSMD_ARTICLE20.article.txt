# Women Basketballers Face Cal In Opener
## 
### STEVE SOULE 
Women's basketball coach
Shirley Schoof anticipates a tight
battle tonight when Stanford's
cagers open their season against
California at the Women's Gym.
"I think it could go either
way," said Schoof, who begins her
third year at the helm of the
women's team. "I don't scout
much, but I think they're about
on a par with us. They beat us by
one point last year."
The varsity game begins at 8
p.m., preceeded by a 6 p.m. JV
contest.
According to Schoof, Stanford
"has good height and excellent
talent. I have high hopes for the
season if we can pull it all
together. And I think we can, as
we not only have talent, but unity
. .. we're not just a lot of
individuals, we're a cohesive
team."
Not only can Schoof talk like a

top-flight coach, but her players
seem able to form the nucleus of a
strong team. Three players —
center Paula Johnson, forward
Jean Reitman and guard Velinda
Parsanal — return from last year's
team, along with Cathleen Chase
and Jenell Edmonds from last
year's JVs. Two players back from
two years ago, two excellent
freshmen and a transfer from
Oregon round out the squad.
The team has been working
hard in preparation for this game,
practicing two hours a day, four
days a week since the start of
winter quarter. The team spent
the first two weeks on
conditioning and fundamentals
before separating the 27-person
turnout into an 11-member
varsity and a 12-member JV.
The rules for women's
basketball are very similar to
those for men, with the major
exceptions being a 30-second shot
clock, the shooting of all fouls
and "no contact."
"You can't hold or push as in
men's basketball," Schoof said.
"The refs call it tighter." The
game tonight looks to be
interesting to basketball fans of
both sexes. As Schoof puts it,
"It's our first game and Cal's first
game, and anything could
happen."
