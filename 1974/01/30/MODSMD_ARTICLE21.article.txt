# Bengals Pick Boryla In Fourth Round
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Mike Boryla, picked by the
Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth
round, was the only Stanford
player selected in the first five
rounds of the National Football
League draft completed yesterday
in New York.
For the 6-4 quarterback, it was
a long way down â€” he was the
sixth man picked in the World
Football League draft last week,
but only the 87th choice of NFL
clubs. "I thought I'd go earlier. I
don't know what happened,"
Boryla, a December graduate, told
the Daily last night.
Boryla now must decide
between the Bengals and the New
York WFL franchise. "I'm going
to take my time and decide in a
couple months. I'll visit both New
York and Cincinnati and meet all
the coaches. Then we'll sit down
and try to work out a contract,"
he said.
As expected, Dallas, which had
the first draft choice, did not
quarrel with the size of Ed "Too
Tall" Jones, a defensive tackle
from Tennessee State, and opened
the session my selecting him.
The next players picked were
Bo Matthews, a Colorado running
back, by San Diego, and John
Hicks, Ohio State offensive tackle,
by the New York Giants.
Four Pacific Eight players were
picked in the first round.
The San Francisco 49ers
drafted UCLA defensive tackle
Bill Sandifer. Minnesota took
both UCLA linebacker Fred
McNeill and USC offensive tackle

Steve Riley, while Lynn Swann,
USC's magnet-armed receiver, was
picked by Pittsburgh.
The previous day, the WFL's
Southern California franchise
announced the signing of UCLA's
Blair Pair, running backs Kermit
Johnson and James McAlister, and
USC offensive tackle Booker
Brown.
Heisman Trophy-winner John
Capelletti of Penn State was
tabbed by the Los Angeles Rams,
while All-America quarterback
David Jaynes of Kansas had to
wait until the third round to be
drafted by his local team, Kansas
City.
In addition to Sandifer, the
49ers, whose most recent three
drafts have been fiascos, picked
Alabama running back Wilbur
Jackson in the first round. The
49ers used their two second round
options to take Kansas running
back Delvin Williams and
Minnesota tight end Keith
Fahnhorst.
Oakland, which has been
drafting sensationally recently,
picked Florida A&M offensive
tackle Henry Lawrence in the first
round and Notre Dame tight end
Dave Casper the second time
around.
Casper was the only member of
the national-champion Fighting
Irish to be picked in the first two
rounds. During this period, no less
than five Tennessee State players
were selected.
The final 12 rounds of the
draft will be completed today.
