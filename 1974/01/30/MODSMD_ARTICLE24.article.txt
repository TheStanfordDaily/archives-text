Gas Rationing More Likely Now
WASHINGTON — Gasoline rationing is a strong
likelihood this summer if the Arab oil embargo is neither
lifted nor eased, federal energy sources said yesterday.
"If the embargo is not lifted, we'd have a very tough
time staying away from rationing," one high source said.
The energy office is concerned that predictions of an
early end to the embargo may have been too optimistic, the
source said.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger predicted that the
embargo would be dropped before the Israeli-Arab
disengagement is completed this spring.
"We're moving ahead with our standby rationing
program," an energy source said. "A lot depends on the
embargo. If it isn't lifted, the gasoline situation later this
spring and early summer is going to be critical."
Federal Energy Chief William E. Simon ordered the
standby rationing program prepared by March 1 just in case
it proves necessary.
Nixon To Address Congress Tonight
WASHINGTON — President Nixon goes before Congress
tonight with a State of the Union address which aides said
would solicit bipartisan cooperation on domestic and
foreign issues.
Sources said they expect Nixon to make at least brief
reference to the Watergate controversy. But they would not
disclose whether the President would squarely confront the
question of impeachment or requests by some congressmen
that he resign.
The half-hour speech, to be broadcast live by all national
radio and TV networks at 6 p.m. (PDT), will be Nixon's
first address to a joint session since his June 1972 report on
his Moscow summit talks.
Ray Contests Earlier Guilty Plea
CINCINNATI — James Earl Ray was given a chance
yesterday to contest his guilty plea in the murder of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. because of allegations his attorneys
compromised his interests to collect royalties from material
written about him.
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ray,
41, who received a 99-year sentence for the 1968 murder of
the civil rights leader, is entitled to a hearing to contest his
1969 guilty plea.
Ray argued that he was not given proper legal advice. He
said his lawyers failed to properly investigate his case and

that their only interest was to collect royalties on materials
written about him.
In a 2-1 decision, the circuit court sent Ray's petition
back to the U.S. District Court in Nashville for review.
Ray alleged he was poorly advised by attorney Arthur
Hanes, and by Percy Foreman after he fired Hanes. He
alleged both were more interested in funds that would
accrue from articles and books planned by Alabama author
William Bradford Huie than in his defense.
Emergency Energy Bill Delayed
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Tuesday to send
emergency energy legislation back to conference with the
House to resolve a controversy over windfall profits by the
oil industry.
The action, which had been urged by the White House,
delays and possibly kills the bill that would have given
President Nixon authority to order gasoline rationing and
other mandatory energy conservation measures.
Moretti Starts Gubernatorial Campaign
SAN FRANCISCO — Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti
launched his campaign for governor yesterday with
optimistic predictions of victory and a promise "to take
California government out of control of a powerful,
privileged few."
The Van Nuys Democrat's announcement only made
official the campaign he has been conducting unofficially
for nearly two years. He was cheerful and relaxed in a
campaign kickoff tour with his wife, Marilyn, and their four
children.
Moretti claimed that in recent private polls he has
already passed San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto and now
trails only Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr., whom
he predicted he would pass as his legislative record becomes
better known during the campaign.
Moretti is the sixth Democrat to enter the race. The
others are Congressman Jerome R. Waldie of Antioch,
University of California Regent William Matson Roth, San
Francisco Mayor Joseph I. Alioto, Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr. and Claremont attorney Herb Hafif.

University of California Regent William Matson Roth, San
Francisco Mayor Joseph I. Alioto, Secretary of State

Today's Weather

Gas Rationing More Likely Now
WASHINGTON — Gasoline rationing is a strong
likelihood this summer if the Arab oil embargo is neither
lifted nor eased, federal energy sources said yesterday.
"If the embargo is not lifted, we'd have a very tough
time staying away from rationing," one high source said.
The energy office is concerned that predictions of an
early end to the embargo may have been too optimistic, the
source said.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger predicted that the
embargo would be dropped before the Israeli-Arab
disengagement is completed this spring.
"We're moving ahead with our standby rationing
program," an energy source said. "A lot depends on the
embargo. If it isn't lifted, the gasoline situation later this
spring and early summer is going to be critical."
Federal Energy Chief William E. Simon ordered the
standby rationing program prepared by March 1 just in case
it proves necessary.
Nixon To Address Congress Tonight
WASHINGTON — President Nixon goes before Congress
tonight with a State of the Union address which aides said
would solicit bipartisan cooperation on domestic and
foreign issues.
Sources said they expect Nixon to make at least brief
reference to the Watergate controversy. But they would not
disclose whether the President would squarely confront the
question of impeachment or requests by some congressmen
that he resign.
The half-hour speech, to be broadcast live by all national
radio and TV networks at 6 p.m. (PDT), will be Nixon's
first address to a joint session since his June 1972 report on
his Moscow summit talks.
Ray Contests Earlier Guilty Plea
CINCINNATI — James Earl Ray was given a chance
yesterday to contest his guilty plea in the murder of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. because of allegations his attorneys
compromised his interests to collect royalties from material
written about him.
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ray,
41, who received a 99-year sentence for the 1968 murder of
the civil rights leader, is entitled to a hearing to contest his
1969 guilty plea.
Ray argued that he was not given proper legal advice. He
said his lawyers failed to properly investigate his case and

that their only interest was to collect royalties on materials
written about him.
In a 2-1 decision, the circuit court sent Ray's petition
back to the U.S. District Court in Nashville for review.
Ray alleged he was poorly advised by attorney Arthur
Hanes, and by Percy Foreman after he fired Hanes. He
alleged both were more interested in funds that would
accrue from articles and books planned by Alabama author
William Bradford Huie than in his defense.
Emergency Energy Bill Delayed
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Tuesday to send
emergency energy legislation back to conference with the
House to resolve a controversy over windfall profits by the
oil industry.
The action, which had been urged by the White House,
delays and possibly kills the bill that would have given
President Nixon authority to order gasoline rationing and
other mandatory energy conservation measures.
Moretti Starts Gubernatorial Campaign
SAN FRANCISCO — Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti
launched his campaign for governor yesterday with
optimistic predictions of victory and a promise "to take
California government out of control of a powerful,
privileged few."
The Van Nuys Democrat's announcement only made
official the campaign he has been conducting unofficially
for nearly two years. He was cheerful and relaxed in a
campaign kickoff tour with his wife, Marilyn, and their four
children.
Moretti claimed that in recent private polls he has
already passed San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto and now
trails only Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr., whom
he predicted he would pass as his legislative record becomes
better known during the campaign.
Moretti is the sixth Democrat to enter the race. The
