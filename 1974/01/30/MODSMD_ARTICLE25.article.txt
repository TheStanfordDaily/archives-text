# Stanford, Cal Link East Asian Programs

Nearly 400 scholars in East Asian
studies at Stanford and UC Berkeley
are now linked by a new joint center
for Chinese and Japanese studies.
The program is unprecedented in
scope, according to Jonathan Lipman,
assistant director of East Asian Studies
here.
"It's really the first time that
Stanford and Berkeley have gotten so
close together on such a large scale.
This is the first time there has been
such a large joint organization,"
Lipman said.
East Asian studies at the two
campuses are already judged among
the top five in the nation, according to
center administrator Anthony
Namkung. The combined program will
include about 90 faculty members and
300 graduate students, he noted.
"If it can be made to work, there
will be more joint centers, not only in
East Asian studies, but also in other
areas," Namkung claimed.
Staffers are already working on
mutual scheduling of seminars and
specialized courses. The center also
plans to publish a directory of East
Asian scholars here and at Berkeley,
including their major fields of interest.
Other projects planned include
increased inter-campus
communication, inter-library
exchange, academic and intellectual
exchange and language instruction.
"We want to encourage exchange in
publishing and the planning of
research; a sort of 'spiritual
carbonation,' " Lipman stated.
The center is instituting an
"outreach" program, in which local
educational institutions can utilize the

resources of the organization. One
such "outreach" program has already
been held.
'Ten graduate students and one
professor were involved in a short
course called The New China' at the
College of Notre Dame in Belmont. It
was a very successful weekend. Each
graduate student had a chance to
speak on a different subject," Lipman
commented.
The center receives its funding from
the federal government under the
National Defense Education Act.
NDEA authorized $125,000 to the
two campuses for 1973-74, of which
$50,000 goes to each campus and
$25,000 goes to joint efforts. Stanford
and Berkeley had originally made
separate applications to the
government for aid, but combined
their appeal at NDEA's suggestion,
according to Lipman and Namkung.
Focuses of the center include
modern China, traditional China,
contemporary Japan, pre-modern
Japan (history and social science),
pre-modern Japan (literature and
humanities), library resources, and
language instruction.
