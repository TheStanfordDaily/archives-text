# University Funds Need Friends
## Corporations—Vital Donors 
### TERRY ANZUR Second Of Three Parts 
In the shadow of rising educational
costs, spiralling tuition rates, wavering
federal support, and increased
dependence on outside gift support,
"Stanford's future depends upon the
enlightened generosity of its friends,"
a University fund-raising pamphlet
maintains.
Among Stanford's "friends" are
corporations who contribute 13
percent of total annual gift dollars to
the University — the fourth largest
chunk among Stanford's major sources
of gift support. Corporations donated
more than $3 million to Stanford in
1971-72. And they are expected to
account for 10 percent of the
Campaign for Stanford's $300 million,
five-year goal. About $11.5 million of
the $30 million corporate target has
been raised to date.
But it is difficult to assess just how
enlightened corporate generosity is, as
the symbiosis of the private university
and the private corporation takes on a
new meaning in the 70s.
As a Stanford trustee from 1954-69
and as chairman of Hewlett-Packard
Co., former deputy defense secretary
David Packard has been on both ends
of University fund-raising. As a trustee
on the receiving end, he thought
"trustees knew best how a corporate

contribution should be used."
Now no longer a trustee, he believes
corporations have a responsibility to
restrict their support to university
schools and departments that
"contribute in some specific way to
our individual companies or to the
general welfare of our free enterprise
system.
Stockholders' Money
"Business could justify doing
more," says Packard. "But when we
commit corporate money we are doing
it on behalf of our stockholders."
According to Packard, part of the
corporate philanthropists'
accountability to stockholders
includes channelling support to areas
that support "the right kind of
professors."
"I don't think we should support
radical people who think the free
enterprise system should be
destroyed," Packard maintains.
"Franklin [fired English prof. H.
Bruce Franklin] and other people are
supported by non-restricted gifts."
Activist Criticism
Packard believes that the University
"should not criticize the system on an
active basis." He favors increased
business aid to higher education in
specific pro-business areas. But
stockholders in some other companies,
who believe that the profits should be

returned directly to investors, oppose
corporate philanthrophy in any form.
Frank Koch, director of public
affairs at Syntex corporation, say his
firm doesn't view support of private
education as "something we have to
justify. Our approach is in tune with
the times, and we inform our
stockholders of the major things that
we're doing. It's our philosophy."
Syntex's statement of contribution
policies and practices recognizes
"contributions to worthy causes and
organizations" as "a necessary and
accepted role for a corporation." To
that end, Syntex sets aside .7 percent
of its anticipated pre-tax profits each
fiscal year for contribution purposes.
Chemistry Building
Syntex recently pledged $1 million
toward Stanford's new chemistry
builing, on the condition that $5
million dollars in additional
construction funds be raised. "And we
are involved in a variety of other
programs at Stanford," Koch points
out. Syntex gave 25,000 to Stanford
in support for programs ranging from
KZSU public affairs to the children's
convalescent hospital.
Although Stanford's most urgent
need is unrestricted money, University
fund-raisers usually approach potential
corporate donors with a specific goal
in mind. As Stanford's director of
corporate relations, associate general
secretary Dwa'n Fullerton strives to
bring together the interests of the
corporate donor and the University.
"We need to find something we can
most easily justify to the
stockholders," Fullerton explains.
"Corporations have rationales for
giving, and each corporation is
different. All corporations are under
pressure not to pay for what is
time-consuming or uncertain."
More Economical
In most cases, a corporation can
make a gift to private education more
economically than can its individual
stockholders. The savings comes in the
form of corporate income tax.
Corporate taxable earnings in excess of
$25,000 are subject to a 48 percent
federal income tax. Thus, tax savings is

PACKARD'S POSITION — David Packard, who served on the Board of Trustees
from 1954-1969 urges today's corporate philanthropists to earmark their gifts
for specific purposes because important University decisions are being made by
"a minority of militant faculty members. These decisions are not always bad,
but they are just not always in the interests of the corporation," Packard says.
