# Nixon Ordered To Testify For Ehrlichman Defense
##

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A
California judge said today he will
order President Nixon to testify in
person for the defense of John
Ehrlichman in the Ellsberg burglary
case. He said it will be the first time in
U.S. history that a state court judge
has taken such action.
Superior Court Judge Gordon
Ringer, acting on a request by
attorneys for Nixon's former top
domestic adviser, said, "The court will
sign and issue a properly prepared
certificate . . . commanding the
President, the honorable Richard M.
Nixon, to testify before this court on
Feb. 25, and to appear on April 15."
The trial of Ehrlichman and two
codefendants on charges of burglary
and conspiracy is to start April 15. A
pretrial hearing is set for Feb. 25.
"The court is persuaded," said
Ringer, "that the honorable Richard
M. Nixon is a material witness for the

defense."
In Washington, presidential
spokesman Gerald L. Warren refused
comment on the judge's action until
he could confer with Nixon's lawyers.
Ringer said he had been so
persuaded by documents presented by
Ehrlichman's attorneys including a
copy of a speech made by the
President on May 22, 1973, in which
he discussed the duties of the secret
white house "plumbers" unit which
carried out the Ellsberg break-in.
However, the judge said that if the
President chooses to resist the
subpoena to testify on claims of
executive privilege or other reasons he
will entertain arguments on the
question.
The motion to call the President as
a witness was raised by attorney
Douglas Dal ton who said that the
President's attorney James St. Clair
had already told him privately the
President would not voluntarily
testify.
"He said he would advise him not
to," Dalton remarked. "He said they
wanted to be consistent, and this
would not be the only effort to
subpoena the President."
He said the possibility was raised
that Nixon would be more willing to
answer written questions in the form
of legal interrogatories.
Just before he ruled, Ringer

appeared to be considering the latter
course rather than a direct order for
the President to appear.
But Dalton arose and argued that
the court did not have the discretion
to decide the form of questioning.
"We would urge you to issue this
subpoena," he said.
In an unusual move, the chief
prosecutor Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen
Trott arose and joined in the defense
suggestion, saying "I think that is
appropriate, your honor."
The judge, furling his brown, said,
"If so, this will be the first time in
history that a state court, exclusive of
the federal court, has issued this kind
of process directly to a President of
the United States."
He said he felt the defendants had
"made an appropriate showing" that
the President's testimony is needed, as
he quickly issued his order.
The hearing of Feb. 25 at which the
President's appearance is ordered
concerns a claim by Ehrlichman and
codefendants G. Gordon Liddy and
David Young that they are being
"discriminaterily prosecuted."
They seek to prove that they were
acting in the same manner as law
enforcement officers, and contend
that such officers, including
policemen, are never prosecuted for
warrantless entry to obtain evidence.
