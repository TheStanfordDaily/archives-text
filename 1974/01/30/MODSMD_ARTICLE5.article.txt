# Generic Prescriptions Mean Lower Prices
## 
### BOB LOWE 
A Cowell physician writes a
prescription which costs the student
$10.45 to fill. A different physician
prescribes exactly the same medicine a
week later, but it costs $12.45. Why
the price difference?
Although the medication's chemical
content and medicinal effect are
identical, and this hypothetical
student is trading with the same
pharmacy, he pays more for the
second prescription because his doctor
wrote the brand name rather than the
generic name.
Suppose a doctor wants to
prescribe aspirin. He could write a
prescription using the generic name —
acetylsalicylic acid. Or, he could use a
brand name — Bayer.
The price difference between
generic and brand drugs varies.
Usually, the brand price is five to 15
percent higher than the generic price.
In some cases a particular brand costs
twice as much as medicine prescribed
generically.
At Cowell, physicians are trying to
save students money, according to Dr.
Armand Gelpi, Cowell's assistant
director for clinical services.
Gelpi said he prescribes by brand
only when "there is an occasional
situation in which we have
information, not from the
pharmaceutical industry, but from
independent sources, which indicate
that there is a clear-cut difference
between brands."
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell, said that although about 50
percent of Cowell's prescriptions are
by brand, many of these are for newer
drugs sold by only one company. In

these cases, a generic prescription
would save the student nothing.
Cowell tries in other ways to make
medicine cheaper for students,
McClenahan said. Several of the most
commonly used drugs, such as
anithistamines, are stocked and
furnished free of charge to students
who need them. In addition, sample
dosages of less-common drugs are
given to students until they can get
prescriptions filled.
Dr. Louis Pang of the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic (PAMC) said that he
usually prescribes by brand because
there is a substantial difference
between products.
Dr. Ben Moore of the PAMC
estimated that only 25 percent of his
prescriptions are generic. He noted
that because of publicity in recent
years, more "patients will make a
point of requesting this [generic
prescriptions]." But he added that the
proportion of patients who do this is
small — only about one out of 25.
An owner of a Palo Alto pharmacy
explained that the difference in price
between generic and brand prescribed
drugs is due mainly to the research
costs of developing new drugs.
"When a company first develops a
drug, it sometimes takes 10 or 12
years," he said. "During the course of
this development they may spend
millions of dollars. They have to
recoup these funds someplace ... and
it costs the people who use the drugs."
A pharmaceutical company which
develops a new drug holds patent
rights for 17 years. Usually, the
company markets the drug under its
own brand name and charges a price
which is higher than the actual cost of
making it. When the patent expires,
other companies begin to manufacture
the medicine under a generic label and
charge a considerably lower price.
Another pharmacist said that
"about four to six years after the
patent expires, the original brand
lowers its price so that it's closer to
generic brands. But, often it's still a bit
higher."
An active and long time proponent
for generic prescriptions, Dr. Fred
Meyer, a physician at the UC Medical
Center in San Francisco, said that in
the future, "prescribing is going to be
by generic names."
Meyer noted that Medicare and
Medi-Cal, which now require doctors
to prescribe generically, will influence
prescription practices.
Debate over generic prescriptions
has included California legislators. Last
year, the state Assembly passed a bill
which would authorize pharmacists to
substitute a cheaper drug with the
"same chemical ingredients of same
strength, quantity and dosage form,
and of same generic drug type" for a
brand prescribed medicine.
The bill is now before the state
Senate. However, a spokesman for
Assemblyman John Burton, D-San
Francisco, one of the bill's co-authors,
said prospects for Senate approval are
slight due to lobbying by big
pharmaceutical companies.

years," he said. "During the course of

A pharmaceutical company which
develops a new drug holds patent
rights for 17 years. Usually, the
company markets the drug under its
own brand name and charges a price
which is higher than the actual cost of
making it. When the patent expires,
other companies begin to manufacture
the medicine under a generic label and
charge a considerably lower price.
Another pharmacist said that
"about four to six years after the
patent expires, the original brand
lowers its price so that it's closer to
generic brands. But, often it's still a bit
higher."
An active and long time proponent
for generic prescriptions, Dr. Fred
Meyer, a physician at the UC Medical
Center in San Francisco, said that in
the future, "prescribing is going to be
by generic names."
Meyer noted that Medicare and
Medi-Cal, which now require doctors
to prescribe generically, will influence
prescription practices.
Debate over generic prescriptions
has included California legislators. Last
year, the state Assembly passed a bill
which would authorize pharmacists to
substitute a cheaper drug with the
"same chemical ingredients of same
strength, quantity and dosage form,
and of same generic drug type" for a
brand prescribed medicine.
The bill is now before the state
Senate. However, a spokesman for
Assemblyman John Burton, D-San
Francisco, one of the bill's co-authors,
said prospects for Senate approval are
slight due to lobbying by big
pharmaceutical companies.
A Cowell physician writes a
prescription which costs the student
$10.45 to fill. A different physician
prescribes exactly the same medicine a
week later, but it costs $12.45. Why
the price difference?
Although the medication's chemical
content and medicinal effect are
identical, and this hypothetical
student is trading with the same
pharmacy, he pays more for the
second prescription because his doctor
wrote the brand name rather than the
generic name.
Suppose a doctor wants to
prescribe aspirin. He could write a
prescription using the generic name —
acetylsalicylic acid. Or, he could use a
brand name — Bayer.
The price difference between
generic and brand drugs varies.
Usually, the brand price is five to 15
percent higher than the generic price.
In some cases a particular brand costs
twice as much as medicine prescribed
generically.
At Cowell, physicians are trying to
save students money, according to Dr.
Armand Gelpi, Cowell's assistant
director for clinical services.
Gelpi said he prescribes by brand
only when "there is an occasional
situation in which we have
information, not from the
pharmaceutical industry, but from
independent sources, which indicate
that there is a clear-cut difference
between brands."
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell, said that although about 50
percent of Cowell's prescriptions are
by brand, many of these are for newer
drugs sold by only one company. In

these cases, a generic prescription
would save the student nothing.
Cowell tries in other ways to make
medicine cheaper for students,
McClenahan said. Several of the most
commonly used drugs, such as
anithistamines, are stocked and
furnished free of charge to students
who need them. In addition, sample
dosages of less-common drugs are
given to students until they can get
prescriptions filled.
Dr. Louis Pang of the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic (PAMC) said that he
usually prescribes by brand because
there is a substantial difference
between products.
Dr. Ben Moore of the PAMC
estimated that only 25 percent of his
prescriptions are generic. He noted
that because of publicity in recent
years, more "patients will make a
point of requesting this [generic
prescriptions]." But he added that the
proportion of patients who do this is
small — only about one out of 25.
An owner of a Palo Alto pharmacy
