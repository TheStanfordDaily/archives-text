Black Prof Dropped
Editor:
You discussed one aspect of the
Donald Harris case under a headline in
the Jan. 25 Daily, ECON
DEPARTMENT LOSES RADICAL
PROF. May I suggest a headline for
another facet: ECON DEPARTMENT
DROPS FIRST AND ONLY BLACK
PROF?
I was invited here five years ago to
organize a program in African and
A fro-American Studies. There were no
Black profs and no courses dealing
with Afro-American economic
problems. Finally, after much
pressure. Professor Harris was
"borrowed" for two years from the
University of Wisconsin. Stanford
Blacks assumed that he would be
offered a tenured post at the end of
the two years since we have only two
tenured Black associate professors in
the whole of Humanities and Sciences.
This institution owes us some
explanation as to why Professor Harris
is now being told to pack up and git
on back to Wisconsin leaving us where
we were before he came with no
courses and no professor. To us the
issue of his radicalism is secondary as
it should be to Economics. They
obviously hired him as a gesture to
pacify and now assume they can drop
him because the "heat is off." Shame!
The Department of Political
Science is worse. They've never had an
Afro-American professor — assistant,
associate or full. And since Ed
Green berg was dropped, no courses are
offered on Black politics — at a time,
too, when this is a subject of national
importance. What goes on in the minds
of people in that department. Who
there cares one iota?
Dean Wright asked me before he
left to serve for a fifth year as
Chairman of African and
Afro-American Studies Programs. I
don't see how I can continue to do so
any longer and preserve any sense of
self-respect or reality when neither
Economics nor Political Science is
willing to provide courses in the
Afro-American field and they defy all
Affirmative Action initiatives.

Academic Information Center
Editor:
I read with great interest the article
on relations between students and
advisors in today's Daily (Jan. 24).
Nancy Colvert exercised considerable
care in her preparation of the article;
our conversation was fairly detailed,
and her paraphrasing of my opinions is
not inaccurate. Yet I want to be sure
that my stance on this issue is clearly
understood.
The objective of the Academic
Information Center is to aid students
and advisors in every way possible in
setting and achieving students'
academic goals. Thus I view the prime
obligation of my office is to give
students who seek information the
most current and accurate answers
with an absolute minimum of hassle.
That goal on our part may at first
glance not jibe with Nancy's quotation
that I believe society coddles
University students too much as it is.
The point: Stanford has always
maintained philosophically that
students should be treated as adults;
especially as a Stanford alumnus, I
heartily concur. Consequently I
believe that we are obligated to help
students who seek our services in every
way.
My philosophy is that the burden in
establishing an effective relationship
between student and advisor falls
about equally on both. Both should
take initiative in getting to know each
other, and both should direct the
relationship first and foremost to
setting and achieving the student's
educational goals. As Dean Mason
Yearian says in the article, a fuller and
more complete relationship may
develop, and if it does, so much the
better.
In any case, I want it understood
that the raison d'etre of the AIC is to
assist both undergraduates and their
advisors in any way we can. Visits and
inquiries are thus always welcome.
