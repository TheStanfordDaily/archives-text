# Define Policies, Goals
## Provide Official Stand 
### 
Much of what is plastered on the
infamous "Unread Second Page" week
after week appears to try to come to
grips with the problem of defining
what Stanford ought to be. But so
many of the complaints of these
unrighteous infidels are aimed towards
symptomatic problems and not the
root causes.
Take as examples three issues
which have recently drawn a lot of
heat and very little light: the Shockley
debates and genetic theories, the
attempts to get ROTC re-established
on campus, and the conflict of
misunderstanding between what is an
official stand by the University and
just another man's opinion â€” on any
and all issues.
The first two issues have polarized
opinion into two main groups: those
who feel the University ought to
encompass all viewpoints, or at least
encourage them if possible, and those
who feel the University ought to be as
selective in accepting and rejecting
ideas as the most conservative or
liberal members of the community.
Clearly, these symptoms point to the
problem of definition. Should
Stanford attempt to fulfill the needs
of the community on an individual
basis, or should it act as a monolithic
institution, serving most of the people
most of the time and to hell with the
rest?
The problem in defining what is the
official stand by the University, on the
other hand, is merely a disguised
attempt of various factions to discover
who really is in charge around here,
where the power lies, and what can be
done to lobby most effectively. One
can hardly be satisfied, though, when a
figurehead such as Lyman spouts some
immortal inanities because the bread
and butter of the college administrator

Stan Baker

lies in his ability to confuse the troops
and pass the buck when necessary.
When one considers the multiplicity
of complaints from groups such as the
farmworkers, minorities, women,
particular schools or departments,
faculty, and students in general only
one thing is clear and that is that
hardly anything is clear.
What is unfortunate is that the
University appears to deal with the
community problems on a piecemeal
basis without formulating any
coherent philosophy. Does such a
thing as a position paper exist on this
campus, to say nothing of an overall
plan or outlook? Perhaps such a
concept has yet been contrived, but
then maybe it operates de facto. There
are too many well documented cases
of people who were afraid publicly to
reveal policies they carried out behind
closed doors. But do institutions in a
democratic society have an obligation
to operate democratically? Certainly
not, some will say.
As an institution, then, should
Stanford attempt to accommodate and
encompass the needs of the individual
or should the University operate as a
monolith, applying its policies across
the board? Certainly, if it chooses the
first course it stands to lose its
coherence as an entity and perhaps its
viability as a result. The second course
runs the risk that in failing to meet the
needs of the mainstream, the school
might become engulfed in the flood of
alternatives found elsewhere.
Judging from past events one could
suspect the answer to these questions
will come slowly and painfully, if at
all, because no one had the guts or
foresight to see our problems, in
depth, and in a context which would
encourage an intelligent, effective
response.
