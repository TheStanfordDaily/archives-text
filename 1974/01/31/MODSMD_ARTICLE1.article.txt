# Nixon Footnotes State Of Union Address
## 'One Year Of Watergate Enough' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon urged last night an end to the
year of Watergate, vowed he will never
resign, and presented the Democratic
Congress with proposals he said can
bring the nation "a year of
unprecedented progress."
He spoke of Watergate in a
dramatic finale to his 44-minute State
of the Union address.
"One year of Watergate is enough,"
he told Congress, the leaders of
American government, the diplomatic
corps and a nation watching and

listening on television and radio.
His talk of the scandals shadowing
the administration came almost as a
footnote — some in the audience
already had left their seats and
prepared to leave the House chamber.
Ends With Watergate
But Nixon had more to say — a
personal word. He said he wanted to
speak of an issue of great concern to
all Americans. "I refer, of course, to
the investigations of the so-called
Watergate affair."
Nixon said it is time to end them.

He said he already has turned over to
the Watergate special prosecutor all
the information and material needed
to prosecute the guilty and clear the
innocent.
Nixon pledged to cooperate with
the House Judiciary Committee, which
is conducting a preliminary
investigation into possible
impeachment proceedings against him.
But he said that cooperation must
be "consistent with my
responsibilities" to preserve all the
prerogatives of the presidency.

He said he will never do anything
that would weaken the office of the
president.
Won't Resign
Nor, he said, will he ever leave that
office voluntarily.
"I have no intention whatever of
walking away from the job the people
elected me to do," he said.
Until the final moments, the Nixon
address had been a summation of
legislative proposals, and of the record
of his first five years in office. He
termed it "an agenda of truly
significant progress," said it would
break the back of the energy crisis and
bring a better life for all Americans.
Oil Embargo Meeting
As he discussed the energy
situation, Nixon disclosed that an
urgent meeting will be called soon in
the Middle East to discuss the lifting
of the Arab oil embargo which has cut
U.S. supplies.
"This is an encouraging sign," he
said. But he added that even if the
embargo is lifted in light of the Middle
East disengagement agreement
between Israel and Egypt, the energy
shortage will not be over.
The White House said after the
Nixon speech that no information was
available on exactly when the meeting
would take place.
Urges Self-Sufficiency
Nixon repeated his call for action
to make the United States
self-sufficient in energy, "not only in
this decade but in the 21st century."
He praised the voluntary
conservation efforts of the American
people.
Much of what he told Congress in
person was in summation of a
22,000-word written State of the
Union message he handed
congressional leaders as he arrived.
He concentrated on a national
health insurance program, a new
system of welfare reform, measures to
guarantee the right of personal privacy
and a new program to subsidize
improved public transportation.
He also forecast improvement in
the economic situation, criticizing
those he called prophets of gloom
while conceding there will be a
continuing inflation program during
the first months of 1974.
But, he vowed, "there will be no
recession."
He said there will be ups and downs
in the "long and hard fight against
inflation" but that if Congress
cooperates "we will win the fight."
Nixon urged that "our national
goal" should be his Project
Independence in the energy area —
that by 1980 the country will not be
dependent on any other nation for its
energy needs.

the Middle East to discuss the lifting
of the Arab oil embargo which has cut
U.S. supplies.
"This is an encouraging sign," he
said. But he added that even if the
embargo is lifted in light of the Middle
East disengagement agreement
between Israel and Egypt, the energy
shortage will not be over.
The White House said after the
Nixon speech that no information was
available on exactly when the meeting
would take place.
Urges Self-Sufficiency
Nixon repeated his call for action
to make the United States
self-sufficient in energy, "not only in
this decade but in the 21st century."
He praised the voluntary
conservation efforts of the American
people.
Much of what he told Congress in
person was in summation of a
22,000-word written State of the
Union message he handed
congressional leaders as he arrived.
He concentrated on a national
health insurance program, a new
system of welfare reform, measures to
guarantee the right of personal privacy
and a new program to subsidize
improved public transportation.
He also forecast improvement in
the economic situation, criticizing
those he called prophets of gloom
while conceding there will be a
continuing inflation program during
the first months of 1974.
But, he vowed, "there will be no
recession."
He said there will be ups and downs
in the "long and hard fight against
inflation" but that if Congress
cooperates "we will win the fight."
Nixon urged that "our national
goal" should be his Project
Independence in the energy area —
that by 1980 the country will not be
dependent on any other nation for its
energy needs.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon urged last night an end to the
year of Watergate, vowed he will never
resign, and presented the Democratic
Congress with proposals he said can
bring the nation "a year of
unprecedented progress."
He spoke of Watergate in a
dramatic finale to his 44-minute State
of the Union address.
"One year of Watergate is enough,"
he told Congress, the leaders of
American government, the diplomatic
corps and a nation watching and

listening on television and radio.
His talk of the scandals shadowing
the administration came almost as a
footnote — some in the audience
already had left their seats and
prepared to leave the House chamber.
Ends With Watergate
But Nixon had more to say — a
personal word. He said he wanted to
speak of an issue of great concern to
all Americans. "I refer, of course, to
the investigations of the so-called
Watergate affair."
Nixon said it is time to end them.

He said he already has turned over to
the Watergate special prosecutor all
the information and material needed
to prosecute the guilty and clear the
innocent.
Nixon pledged to cooperate with
the House Judiciary Committee, which
is conducting a preliminary
investigation into possible
impeachment proceedings against him.
But he said that cooperation must
be "consistent with my
responsibilities" to preserve all the
prerogatives of the presidency.

He said he will never do anything
that would weaken the office of the
president.
Won't Resign
Nor, he said, will he ever leave that
office voluntarily.
"I have no intention whatever of
walking away from the job the people
elected me to do," he said.
Until the final moments, the Nixon
address had been a summation of
legislative proposals, and of the record
of his first five years in office. He
termed it "an agenda of truly
significant progress," said it would
break the back of the energy crisis and
bring a better life for all Americans.
Oil Embargo Meeting
As he discussed the energy
situation, Nixon disclosed that an
urgent meeting will be called soon in
the Middle East to discuss the lifting
of the Arab oil embargo which has cut
U.S. supplies.
"This is an encouraging sign," he
said. But he added that even if the
embargo is lifted in light of the Middle
East disengagement agreement
