# Varied Perspective
## Econ Department Needs Marxian Profs 
### 
Lynam And Wechsler

(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion of
a series on issues in the Economics Department. Part
I discussed the history of and need for Marxist
economics at Stanford.)
The discussion of proposals to develop offerings
in Marxist economics has included a number of
arguments which deserve consideration and
refutation.
At a recent economics faculty meeting, one
participant claimed that whatever is important and
non-political in the Marxist paradigm should be
capable of textbook treatment so that any present
member of the staff could teach it. A curious logic
underpins such a statement. Presumably all courses
could be assigned to the faculty at a large bingo
meeting at the start of each academic year!
Fortunately for all concerned, the economics
department is more discriminating in its course
assignments.
There is further reason to doubt the sincerity of
this objection. Graduate education should be at the
frontier of knowledge with active participants in its
extention available as advisors. No one-textbook
training in the Marxist tradition can supply such a
presence.
The department carefully chooses whom it
allows to teach. One recent example is instructive.
Last year, the department refused to continue to
allow comprehensive credit for Economics of
Education given by Profs. Carnoy and Levin,
economists in the School of Education who have
had courtesy appointments with the department.
Part of the sub-rosa discussion on this centered on
doubts about their competence in economics.
Though both have been trained in and have
published neoclassical work, they are regarded as
radicals. But it was thoroughly incidental that their
courses were not up to departmental standards.
(The final comment on this matter comes from
Berkeley's Economics Department, which has just
established a field in education economics to satisfy
the large demand in this area; the requirements are

met by one course at Berkeley and one from either
Carnoy or Levin!)
Prof. Muth has suggested that the best reason to
avoid Marxist economics is that acceptance of it
would subject a graduate student to the loss of the
massive present value of an income stream of about
ten thousand dollars per year. We think this
statement, while crassly measuring the value of ideas
in terms of neoclassical profit maximization (instead
of truth), deserves more attention than it has
received.
It reflects a realization of the wanton
discrimination and elimination that people working
in the Marxist tradition have been subjected to by
our universities. An implication is that serious study
of this paradigm cannot easily procede without
concurrent staffing of positions with people
working in and sympathetic to the tradition.
Without proposals like those made by UEPE,
Marxist economists will continue to circulate
through the University much as through a revolving
door. Those who "convert" or come out of the
closet after obtaining tenure will work in isolation
from the supportive, innovative contributions of
junior faculty. The axe will continue to hang over
grad students' "free" choice of ideas.
We agree with Prof. Abramowitz that Marxian
economics is not just a field, but a "series of ideas
which permeate the whole structure of economics."
But he should realize that this makes its present
treatment that much more regrettable. The
proposals are of modest dimension since they seek
to correct the massive lack of critical theory in
economics with the limited commitment of a
graduate field and more undergrad offerings. If
Marxist ideas have not yet permeated this
economics department, is that any reason to bury
our heads completely?
A serious consideration is the opportunity cost
of the proposals. With a limited budget, some feel

personnel in other fields would have to be foregone.
But the proposals are specifically constructed to
allow hiring of people with joint concerns in any of
the other established fields or to offer for the first
time a program in comparative economic systems.
Do we want attrition or truth to be the basis for
the success of ideas? If we are to create an economic
science, there must be informed consideration of
serious alternative theories. We want a faculty which
reflects the divergence of perspectives among the
world's economists and a curriculum that challenges
students to choose from these perspectives.
Marxist scholars like Don Harris would be a
"great inspiration to both students and faculty" as
well as "absolutely superb as a resource for graduate
students and junior faculty;" they are less expensive
than the great neoclassical prima donnas. Contrary
to the need for more experience is the pressing need
for the department to strengthen its offerings now.
Few fields have been so long in the making.
The partial success of hundreds of students and
faculty over the past years to create something
approaching what these proposals represent is
testimony to the fact that hard work gets results.
But the department's reluctance to change means
that without this work even these small gains will be
whittled away.
The Economics Department is not in turmoil as
the Daily headline suggested; it is engaged in its
most significant discussion in years. For this very
reason, we shall hold an open meeting Friday at
2:30 in Tresidder 270. Courses in addition to Econ.
120 can exist only if the proposals are won.
The job of remaking economic theory and
opening up the department to alternative
approaches is upon us.

Prof. Muth has suggested that the best reason to
avoid Marxist economics is that acceptance of it
would subject a graduate student to the loss of the
massive present value of an income stream of about
ten thousand dollars per year. We think this
statement, while crassly measuring the value of ideas
in terms of neoclassical profit maximization (instead
of truth), deserves more attention than it has
received.
It reflects a realization of the wanton
discrimination and elimination that people working
in the Marxist tradition have been subjected to by
our universities. An implication is that serious study
of this paradigm cannot easily procede without
concurrent staffing of positions with people
working in and sympathetic to the tradition.
Without proposals like those made by UEPE,
Marxist economists will continue to circulate
through the University much as through a revolving
door. Those who "convert" or come out of the
closet after obtaining tenure will work in isolation
from the supportive, innovative contributions of
junior faculty. The axe will continue to hang over
grad students' "free" choice of ideas.
We agree with Prof. Abramowitz that Marxian
economics is not just a field, but a "series of ideas
which permeate the whole structure of economics."
But he should realize that this makes its present
treatment that much more regrettable. The
proposals are of modest dimension since they seek
to correct the massive lack of critical theory in
economics with the limited commitment of a
graduate field and more undergrad offerings. If
Marxist ideas have not yet permeated this
economics department, is that any reason to bury
our heads completely?
A serious consideration is the opportunity cost
of the proposals. With a limited budget, some feel

personnel in other fields would have to be foregone.
But the proposals are specifically constructed to
allow hiring of people with joint concerns in any of
the other established fields or to offer for the first
time a program in comparative economic systems.
Do we want attrition or truth to be the basis for
the success of ideas? If we are to create an economic
science, there must be informed consideration of
serious alternative theories. We want a faculty which
reflects the divergence of perspectives among the
world's economists and a curriculum that challenges
students to choose from these perspectives.
Marxist scholars like Don Harris would be a
"great inspiration to both students and faculty" as
well as "absolutely superb as a resource for graduate
students and junior faculty;" they are less expensive
than the great neoclassical prima donnas. Contrary
to the need for more experience is the pressing need
for the department to strengthen its offerings now.
Few fields have been so long in the making.
The partial success of hundreds of students and
faculty over the past years to create something
approaching what these proposals represent is
testimony to the fact that hard work gets results.
But the department's reluctance to change means
that without this work even these small gains will be
whittled away.
The Economics Department is not in turmoil as
the Daily headline suggested; it is engaged in its
most significant discussion in years. For this very
reason, we shall hold an open meeting Friday at
2:30 in Tresidder 270. Courses in addition to Econ.
120 can exist only if the proposals are won.
The job of remaking economic theory and
opening up the department to alternative
approaches is upon us.

(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion of
a series on issues in the Economics Department. Part
I discussed the history of and need for Marxist
economics at Stanford.)
The discussion of proposals to develop offerings
in Marxist economics has included a number of
arguments which deserve consideration and
refutation.
At a recent economics faculty meeting, one
participant claimed that whatever is important and
non-political in the Marxist paradigm should be
capable of textbook treatment so that any present
member of the staff could teach it. A curious logic
underpins such a statement. Presumably all courses
could be assigned to the faculty at a large bingo
meeting at the start of each academic year!
Fortunately for all concerned, the economics
department is more discriminating in its course
assignments.
There is further reason to doubt the sincerity of
this objection. Graduate education should be at the
frontier of knowledge with active participants in its
extention available as advisors. No one-textbook
training in the Marxist tradition can supply such a
presence.
The department carefully chooses whom it
allows to teach. One recent example is instructive.
Last year, the department refused to continue to
allow comprehensive credit for Economics of
Education given by Profs. Carnoy and Levin,
economists in the School of Education who have
had courtesy appointments with the department.
Part of the sub-rosa discussion on this centered on
doubts about their competence in economics.
Though both have been trained in and have
published neoclassical work, they are regarded as
radicals. But it was thoroughly incidental that their
courses were not up to departmental standards.
(The final comment on this matter comes from
Berkeley's Economics Department, which has just
established a field in education economics to satisfy
the large demand in this area; the requirements are

met by one course at Berkeley and one from either
Carnoy or Levin!)

Do we want attrition or truth to be the basis for
the success of ideas? If we are to create an economic
science, there must be informed consideration of
serious alternative theories. We want a faculty which
reflects the divergence of perspectives among the
world's economists and a curriculum that challenges
students to choose from these perspectives.
Marxist scholars like Don Harris would be a
"great inspiration to both students and faculty" as
well as "absolutely superb as a resource for graduate
students and junior faculty;" they are less expensive
than the great neoclassical prima donnas. Contrary
to the need for more experience is the pressing need
for the department to strengthen its offerings now.
Few fields have been so long in the making.
The partial success of hundreds of students and
faculty over the past years to create something
approaching what these proposals represent is
testimony to the fact that hard work gets results.
But the department's reluctance to change means
that without this work even these small gains will be
whittled away.
The Economics Department is not in turmoil as
the Daily headline suggested; it is engaged in its
most significant discussion in years. For this very
reason, we shall hold an open meeting Friday at
2:30 in Tresidder 270. Courses in addition to Econ.
120 can exist only if the proposals are won.
The job of remaking economic theory and
opening up the department to alternative
approaches is upon us.

(Continued from yesterday, this is the conclusion of
a series on issues in the Economics Department. Part
I discussed the history of and need for Marxist
economics at Stanford.)
The discussion of proposals to develop offerings
in Marxist economics has included a number of
arguments which deserve consideration and
refutation.
At a recent economics faculty meeting, one
participant claimed that whatever is important and
non-political in the Marxist paradigm should be
capable of textbook treatment so that any present
member of the staff could teach it. A curious logic
underpins such a statement. Presumably all courses
could be assigned to the faculty at a large bingo
meeting at the start of each academic year!
Fortunately for all concerned, the economics
department is more discriminating in its course
assignments.
There is further reason to doubt the sincerity of
this objection. Graduate education should be at the
frontier of knowledge with active participants in its
extention available as advisors. No one-textbook
training in the Marxist tradition can supply such a
presence.
The department carefully chooses whom it
allows to teach. One recent example is instructive.
Last year, the department refused to continue to
allow comprehensive credit for Economics of
Education given by Profs. Carnoy and Levin,
economists in the School of Education who have
had courtesy appointments with the department.
Part of the sub-rosa discussion on this centered on
doubts about their competence in economics.
Though both have been trained in and have
published neoclassical work, they are regarded as
radicals. But it was thoroughly incidental that their
courses were not up to departmental standards.
(The final comment on this matter comes from
Berkeley's Economics Department, which has just
established a field in education economics to satisfy
the large demand in this area; the requirements are

met by one course at Berkeley and one from either
Carnoy or Levin!)
Prof. Muth has suggested that the best reason to
avoid Marxist economics is that acceptance of it
would subject a graduate student to the loss of the
massive present value of an income stream of about
ten thousand dollars per year. We think this
statement, while crassly measuring the value of ideas
in terms of neoclassical profit maximization (instead
of truth), deserves more attention than it has
received.
It reflects a realization of the wanton
discrimination and elimination that people working
in the Marxist tradition have been subjected to by
our universities. An implication is that serious study
of this paradigm cannot easily procede without
concurrent staffing of positions with people
working in and sympathetic to the tradition.
Without proposals like those made by UEPE,
Marxist economists will continue to circulate
through the University much as through a revolving
door. Those who "convert" or come out of the
closet after obtaining tenure will work in isolation
from the supportive, innovative contributions of
junior faculty. The axe will continue to hang over
grad students' "free" choice of ideas.
We agree with Prof. Abramowitz that Marxian
economics is not just a field, but a "series of ideas
which permeate the whole structure of economics."
But he should realize that this makes its present
treatment that much more regrettable. The
proposals are of modest dimension since they seek
to correct the massive lack of critical theory in
economics with the limited commitment of a
graduate field and more undergrad offerings. If
Marxist ideas have not yet permeated this
economics department, is that any reason to bury
our heads completely?
A serious consideration is the opportunity cost
of the proposals. With a limited budget, some feel

personnel in other fields would have to be foregone.
But the proposals are specifically constructed to
allow hiring of people with joint concerns in any of
the other established fields or to offer for the first
time a program in comparative economic systems.
