# Campus Awareness Low
## Mental Stimulation Needed Outside Class 
### 
Larry Diamond

Stanford has changed in some sweeping ways in
the last few years. That there are no longer the
repeated massive protests, the deep and bitter
political polarization, the violent spasms of war
games in White Plaza — all this is obvious, and a
relief to most in the University community who had
to live through it.
But with the disappearance of the anger and
violence surrounding political debate in those years,
political thought and discussion have themselves
withered away to almost nothing on this campus.
Much more disturbing than the shift in student
political views over the last few years is the atrophy
of concern over social issues in general.
The energy shortage and the huge oil profits, the
state of our cities, our electoral system, the conflict
between ecological and energy imperatives, the
federal budget priorities and the size of the military
budget in particular, the opportunities for
minorities in society today, the Arab-Israeli
controversy, Russia and her repression of
courageous dissidents, dictatorships supported with
U.S. aid — these are crucial issues that will
profoundly affect our lives and those of our
children.
Yet debate on issues such as these takes place
mostly in the formal structure of the classroom,
within the limited framework and scope of
particular classes. Particularly in the University
residences, where the majority of undergraduates
live, there seems to be little discussion of pressing
current issues and events.
Low Awareness
Awareness, for one, is very low. Most Stanford
students do not have any regular comprehensive
contact with the news. The average Stanford
student is surprisingly ignorant of what is happening
in this and other societies.
The atmosphere here, and the individual
attitudes that help generate it, account for much of
this intellectual isolation. It isn't only the sun and
green foothills and palm trees and squirrels, it is also
the grade-grovelling syndrome. What awareness and
sensitivity to social issues students do bring in here
is often quickly ground down in the frantic rush to
pile up grades and units and all the other necessary

pre-professional credentials.
It's not all the system — much of this is
self-inflicted. A great many pre-professional
students allow their mental attention (and some,
their whole lives) to be completely consumed and
dominated by their classes. It doesn't have to be like
that, but they have their futures on their minds —
careers, salaries, security, comfort — and they don't
want to take the slightest chance of messing up
somewhere.
Work, Study, Kill
The radicals had a phrase for it a few years ago —
"work, study, get ahead, kill." The working,
studying, and getting ahead are going on more
furiously than ever before, though the deliberate
killing abroad by this country's trained professionals
has ended. What remains however, is the
unintentional killing and suffering we inflict
through our ignorance of social and political
conditions that oppress people, and our resulting
incapacity to act on alternatives that might lessen
their oppression.
Part of the problem is the institution, and how
little it stimulates people to think about these kinds
of issues outside the classroom. One good way to
begin to eliminate the stagnation in the intellectual
climate here regarding public issues is to bring in
some visiting speakers and lecturers who will force
people to think.
Getting top visiting figures is a matter of money
and organized effort. We are short on both now, but
particularly the former. One obvious source of
funds is the students themselves. It is vitally
important that there be some kind of fee assessment
passed in the next student body elections to provide
for a fund to bring out the leading people on the
guest lecture circuit in this country.
Guests-In-Residence
In addition, if University administrators are
serious about this notion of residential education,
they ought to be willing to make funds available to
help bnng out stimulating thinkers and public
figures who would actually live in the dorm
complexes for two or three days as
guests-in-residence. There is a great deal of critical
thinking that these people could generate in the

milieu of an informal dorm gathering, or a
discussion over dinner, that they could not do in a
speech at Memorial Auditorium.
Beyond this, people of all political shades and
statuses at Stanford who would like to see a more
lively and thoughtful political climate here need to
get themselves together in some kind of political
union, the unique role of which would be to gather
together private and institutional resources to bring
out noted figures on both sides of an issue to debate
before a campus-wide audience.
Speeches are important, but there is no single
kind of event that more fully captures the essence
of what a University is supposed to be about than a
debate.
Imagine Henry Kissinger and Henry Jackson
debating here over our policy of detente with the
Soviet Union. Imagine William F. Buckley and
Germane Greer agreeing to a rematch here of their
televised debate over the femininst movement. Or
William Proxmire vs. Melvin Laird on our priorities
in the federal budget and the growth of military
expenditures. Or Edward Kennedy vs. John
Connally on the tax structure in America.
How about Ramsey Clark debating William
Rehnquist on civil liberties in America, and the
recent reversals of many Warren Court precedents in
that area? Or maybe George McGovern meeting
Robert McNamara in a retrospective debate on the
wisdom and morality of the Vietnam War?
Imagine that we could stimulate large numbers of
people in this community to argue with each other,
now and then, about some of these great issues,
argue factually and .intelligently, without the
tension and personal bitterness which made these
kinds of serious and fair-minded discussions so
difficult a few years ago. Isn't this one of the vital
missions of a great university?
Surely, among the many other members of the
Stanford community who are disturbed and bored
by the self-directed student climate here, there must
be some large number of people anxious to invest
some time and even a little money to agitate that
climate with some exciting visiting speakers.
