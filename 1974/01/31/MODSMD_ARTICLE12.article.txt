# Study Says Kids Bring Happiness
## 'People Need Children' 
### ANNE CUSICK 
One of the most universal reasons for having
children is to provide parents with a sense of
lappiness and companionship, psychologist James
Fawcett told an audience of 125 in Bishop
~rium Tuesday night.
Fawcett, researching population trends at the
University of Hawaii East-West Center in Honolulu,
vent on to explain his findings in his speech, "The
of Children-Continuity and Change." The
•esearch project, conducted in six countries (Japan,
<orea, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines and the
United States), studied in functional terms the
leeds parents feel are met by having children and
low changing social values have altered these
•easons.
Fawcett offered 10 values that his group found
,o be major determinants in the decision to have
children. Fawcett said the positive — the emotional
ind economic benefits, the parents'
lelf-enrichment, the satisfaction they derive from
-heir childrens' achievements and the creation of
Wronger family cohesiveness and continuity — are
he major psychological and sociological
xmtributors to the continued population growth
hroughout the world.
Values Vary
Through interviewing large segments of people
n three socio-economic levels — urban middle class,
jrban lower class and agricultural — he found these
values varying in importance.
The agricultural segments of the population tend
-o emphasize the economic advantages of children
.vhile the urban middle class generally cites the
psychological satisfactions and intrinsic values of
children as their reasons for having families.
The urban lower class was found to lean toward
instrumental aspects, with emotional values also
stressed.
A child with great potential ability, closer to his
parents, and wanting his own way was generally
thought by those interviewed in the six-country
>tudy to come from a small family, while popular
children were believed to come from a large family.
Fawcett also found that boys are preferred over
jirls.
Fawcett described some negative values of child
Pearing as emotional strain, economic cost,
restrictions on opportunities, physical demands and
:he creation of family problems.

With the advent of women's liberation and the
emphasis on over-population, these disadvantages
have received more attention and, consequently,
have helped lower the fertility rate in the United
States.
Research in this area is not new, Fawcett said,
but not until recently has the emphasis turned from
theory toward research. The three ways generally
used to study population trends have beer
psychological, demographic, and economic.
However, Fawcett described the last two as too
simple and mechanical, stating the need for more
systematic research.
Many other insights into how parents view
children were gathered, although Fawcett made it
clear that this study was not yet large enough in
scope to be taken as universal.
The large majority of those interviewed
considered four children to be a heavy financial
burden. However, Fawcett said he believes that
most parents have no clear realization of the actual
cost involved in rearing a child.
Fawcett said that most parents wanted girls for
help around the house, companionship for the
mother, and distinctive personal qualities parents
find desirable.
Boys were preferred as an economic help when
they are older, often as financial security for the
parents' retirement and in preserving the family
name.
Thus, girls are desirable when young and in the
home and boys for more long-range reasons when
they are adults, Fawcett said. However, he said he
does not consider these reasons as fully explaining
the preference for boys.
Public Policy
Fawcett also discussed several public policies
through which population growth could be
decreased. He stressed that although the fertility
rate is dropping, the population would increase
steadily in the next 70 years even if kept down to
the "replacement level" of 2.1 births per family.
He suggested that the negative values of large
families become more widely known through
educational and communication methods. The
sociological necessities of having children to prove
woman- or manhood, or the closeness of the
marriage, should also be deemphasized, he said.
In high fertility countries, methods should be
begun or expanded.

n three socio-economic levels — urban middle class,
jrban lower class and agricultural — he found these
values varying in importance.
The agricultural segments of the population tend
-o emphasize the economic advantages of children
.vhile the urban middle class generally cites the
psychological satisfactions and intrinsic values of
children as their reasons for having families.
The urban lower class was found to lean toward
instrumental aspects, with emotional values also
stressed.
A child with great potential ability, closer to his
parents, and wanting his own way was generally
thought by those interviewed in the six-country
>tudy to come from a small family, while popular
children were believed to come from a large family.
Fawcett also found that boys are preferred over
jirls.
Fawcett described some negative values of child
Pearing as emotional strain, economic cost,
restrictions on opportunities, physical demands and
:he creation of family problems.

With the advent of women's liberation and the
emphasis on over-population, these disadvantages
have received more attention and, consequently,
have helped lower the fertility rate in the United
States.
Research in this area is not new, Fawcett said,
but not until recently has the emphasis turned from
theory toward research. The three ways generally
used to study population trends have beer
psychological, demographic, and economic.
However, Fawcett described the last two as too
simple and mechanical, stating the need for more
systematic research.
Many other insights into how parents view
children were gathered, although Fawcett made it
clear that this study was not yet large enough in
scope to be taken as universal.
The large majority of those interviewed
considered four children to be a heavy financial
burden. However, Fawcett said he believes that
most parents have no clear realization of the actual
cost involved in rearing a child.
Fawcett said that most parents wanted girls for
help around the house, companionship for the
mother, and distinctive personal qualities parents
find desirable.
Boys were preferred as an economic help when
they are older, often as financial security for the
parents' retirement and in preserving the family
name.
Thus, girls are desirable when young and in the
home and boys for more long-range reasons when
they are adults, Fawcett said. However, he said he
does not consider these reasons as fully explaining
the preference for boys.
Public Policy
Fawcett also discussed several public policies
through which population growth could be
decreased. He stressed that although the fertility
rate is dropping, the population would increase
steadily in the next 70 years even if kept down to
the "replacement level" of 2.1 births per family.
He suggested that the negative values of large
families become more widely known through
educational and communication methods. The
sociological necessities of having children to prove
woman- or manhood, or the closeness of the
marriage, should also be deemphasized, he said.
In high fertility countries, methods should be
begun or expanded.
One of the most universal reasons for having
children is to provide parents with a sense of
lappiness and companionship, psychologist James
Fawcett told an audience of 125 in Bishop
~rium Tuesday night.
