# Utilities Seek Rate Increases
## 
### 
(AP) The energy crisis that
prompted you to turn down your
lights has prompted utilities to ask
permission to charge you more for
using less.

An Associated Press survey
showed that utilities are seeking
or have been granted rate
increases that many say are
needed to offset declining profits
caused by energy conservation
efforts.
Some of the increases are
called conservation surcharges and
most of them would tack an extra
10 percent on the average
consumer's monthly electricity
bill.
In addition, Americans are
finding their bills going up
because of fuel price increases
that companies are allowed to
pass on to their customers
automatically.
Pinch Felt
The AP survey showed that
virtually every area of the country
was feeling the pinch and state
commissions responsible for
reviewing electricity rates said
they were swamped with requests
for increases.
"We're facing the largest
workload in our history," said
Robert Lenaghen of the Idaho
Public Service Commission,
"Every utility within this
commission's jurisdiction has a
rate increase pending."
The Washington Gas & Light
Co., which serves 546,000
customers in the capital and
Maryland and Virginia suburbs,
has asked for permission to raise
rates an average of 6.7 percent,

primarily to make up for a 6
percent drop in demand.
Paul E. Reichardt, the
company president, said that
although 1973 revenues were up
$3 million over 1972, they fell
$16.6 million short of
expectations. He said $7.6 million
of the loss was due to lower
consumption because of warm
weather and $9 million was due to
conservation efforts. He also said
labor costs will increase $3 million
this year.
Charge Added
Consolidated Edison Co. of
New York added $1.46 to the
January bill of the average
customer to reflect fuel cost
hikes. Now the company
is seeking rate increases that
would yield an additional $315
million a year.
The company said it needs the
money because of higher costs for
taxes, interest, labor and
materials. Normally, Con Ed said,
a rate increase of 22.6 percent
would yield the needed revenue.
The company argued, however,
that because consumption has
dropped, it will need an additional
increase, probably 6.7 percent, to
make up the difference.
Some consumers find their
electricity bills have jumped as
much as 30 percent in the last
year and a half with much of the
increase coming in the last month
or so.

rate increase pending."
The Washington Gas & Light
Co., which serves 546,000
customers in the capital and
Maryland and Virginia suburbs,
has asked for permission to raise
rates an average of 6.7 percent,

primarily to make up for a 6
percent drop in demand.
Paul E. Reichardt, the
company president, said that
although 1973 revenues were up
$3 million over 1972, they fell
$16.6 million short of
expectations. He said $7.6 million
of the loss was due to lower
consumption because of warm
weather and $9 million was due to
conservation efforts. He also said
labor costs will increase $3 million
this year.
Charge Added
Consolidated Edison Co. of
New York added $1.46 to the
January bill of the average
customer to reflect fuel cost
hikes. Now the company
is seeking rate increases that
would yield an additional $315
million a year.
The company said it needs the
money because of higher costs for
taxes, interest, labor and
materials. Normally, Con Ed said,
a rate increase of 22.6 percent
would yield the needed revenue.
The company argued, however,
that because consumption has
dropped, it will need an additional
increase, probably 6.7 percent, to
make up the difference.
Some consumers find their
electricity bills have jumped as
much as 30 percent in the last
year and a half with much of the
increase coming in the last month
or so.
(AP) The energy crisis that
prompted you to turn down your
lights has prompted utilities to ask
permission to charge you more for
using less.

An Associated Press survey
showed that utilities are seeking
or have been granted rate
increases that many say are
needed to offset declining profits
caused by energy conservation
efforts.
Some of the increases are
called conservation surcharges and
most of them would tack an extra
10 percent on the average
consumer's monthly electricity
bill.
In addition, Americans are
finding their bills going up
because of fuel price increases
that companies are allowed to
pass on to their customers
automatically.
Pinch Felt
The AP survey showed that
virtually every area of the country
was feeling the pinch and state
commissions responsible for
reviewing electricity rates said
they were swamped with requests
for increases.
"We're facing the largest
workload in our history," said
Robert Lenaghen of the Idaho
Public Service Commission,
"Every utility within this
commission's jurisdiction has a
rate increase pending."
