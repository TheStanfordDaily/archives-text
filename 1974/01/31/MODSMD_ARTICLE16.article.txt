# Fuel Crisis May Hurt Crops

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
California farmer today declared
that electrical curtailment could
spell disaster for agriculture in the
state.
Gerald Geiger, a Richvale rice
grower and chairman of the
California Farm Bureau Energy
Committee, warned that power
outages could bring about crop
losses and result in animal deaths.
"Curtailment of energy at the
farm level would produce a

domino effect, and such
interruption could result in
substantial unemployment and
increased food costs," he said.
Geiger told a state Public
Utilities Commission hearing on
energy that "economics and the
advanced technology of
agricultural production have
created a crucial reliance upon
electricity."
"Growers who anticipate
shortages of electricity for
irrigation might elect not to plant
or chose a crop with a smaller
water requirement," Geiger said.
"Such a choice could interrupt
our normal food production and
distribution patterns with serious
consequences for all consumers."
He pointed out that California
leads the nation in the production
of 50 commercial crops and
livestock commodities and
provides a major portion of the
nation's fruit and vegetables.
The former vice president of
the state farm bureau cited
potential losses which would
result in electrical shortages.
"To meet environmental
pressures and to control disease,
egg producers have built closed
environment houses for the
birds," he said. "Air movement is
necessary for temperature control.
If the flow is stopped, the birds
will die."
Geiger also outlined potential
dairy industry losses if cows are
not milked on schedule or

refrigeration of raw milk is
curtailed. State regulations, he
said, require producers to
maintain milk temperatures below
50 degrees and force them to
dump the milk if the temperatures
rise above this level.
"If a farmer has orchards, vines
or fruit trees, depriving him of
water may cost one year's crop or
might damage the trees," Geiger
testified. "In most of these
instances, a period of three to six
years has been invested in the
development and growth of the
trees to a fruit-bearing stage and
the economic loss to the farmer as
well as the impact in the
marketplace could be
extraordinarily severe."
Geiger also noted that a decline
in the availability of natural gas
could have a marked effect on the
manufacture of fertilizer, resulting
in severe shortage of the product.

development and growth of the
trees to a fruit-bearing stage and

marketplace could be

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
California farmer today declared
that electrical curtailment could
spell disaster for agriculture in the
state.
Gerald Geiger, a Richvale rice
grower and chairman of the
California Farm Bureau Energy
Committee, warned that power
outages could bring about crop
losses and result in animal deaths.
"Curtailment of energy at the
farm level would produce a

domino effect, and such
interruption could result in
substantial unemployment and
increased food costs," he said.
Geiger told a state Public
Utilities Commission hearing on
energy that "economics and the
advanced technology of
agricultural production have
created a crucial reliance upon
electricity."
"Growers who anticipate
shortages of electricity for
irrigation might elect not to plant
or chose a crop with a smaller
water requirement," Geiger said.
"Such a choice could interrupt
our normal food production and
distribution patterns with serious
consequences for all consumers."
He pointed out that California
leads the nation in the production
of 50 commercial crops and
livestock commodities and
provides a major portion of the
nation's fruit and vegetables.
The former vice president of
the state farm bureau cited
potential losses which would
result in electrical shortages.
"To meet environmental
pressures and to control disease,
egg producers have built closed
environment houses for the
birds," he said. "Air movement is
necessary for temperature control.
If the flow is stopped, the birds
will die."
Geiger also outlined potential
dairy industry losses if cows are
not milked on schedule or

refrigeration of raw milk is
curtailed. State regulations, he
said, require producers to
maintain milk temperatures below
50 degrees and force them to
dump the milk if the temperatures
rise above this level.
"If a farmer has orchards, vines
or fruit trees, depriving him of
water may cost one year's crop or
might damage the trees," Geiger
testified. "In most of these
instances, a period of three to six
years has been invested in the
development and growth of the
trees to a fruit-bearing stage and
the economic loss to the farmer as
well as the impact in the
marketplace could be
extraordinarily severe."
Geiger also noted that a decline
in the availability of natural gas
could have a marked effect on the
manufacture of fertilizer, resulting
in severe shortage of the product.
