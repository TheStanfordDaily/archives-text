# Oregon Gas Allocation Plan Is Working Despite Ridicule
## 
### 
SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Oregon's
new gasoline allocation program
has become the butt of countless
jokes, but the last laugh is on the
unbelievers.
Under the voluntary system,
which took effect early this
month, Oregon motorists with
odd-numbered license plates buy
gasoline on odd-numbered
calendar days and those with
even-numbered plates on
even-numbered days.

Typical of the humor inspired
by the system was a sign at the
local Marion County Public
Welfare office when the
Willamette River flooded
restrooms recently.
The sign said a substitute privy
could be used, depending upon a
person's Social Security umber
and whether the number was odd
or even — even numbers for the
a.m., odd numbers for the p.m.
System Works
The jokes have not obscured
one thing, however. The system is
working. Panic buying has
stopped. The plan already has
spread across the Columbiaßiver
into neighboring southwest
Washington, where gasoline is
equally scarce, and a mandatory
odd-even system went into effect
in Hawaii's Honolulu County on
Monday. Officials think more
states will follow suit if the
gasoline situation becomes more
serious.
Oregon motorists struggled
through three weeks of chaos
before officials devised the plan.
Gasoline dealers discovered
their supplies were running low
just before Christmas and, as the
word spread, motorists began
lining up at gasoline stations to
keep their tanks full for holiday
travel.
Police were forced to patrol
streets near some stations both for
traffic control and protection of
attendants who sometimes were
threatened by irate customers.
Fast Pace
The harried attendants stopped
washing windshields and checking
oil as they concentrated on

getting gas into the tanks. One
dealer suffered a heart attack.
Operating hours became
shorter and shorter as dealers
imposed daily quotas so their
supply would last the month. The
shortage was so severe that traffic
on Portland freeways dropped 20
percent.
When dealers agreed to the
voluntary plan suggested by Gov.
Tom McCall's energy staff early in
January, the problem melted
away as fast as it had developed.
Although gasoline supplies
remain short in Oregon, the plan
clearly is working as stations are
staying open longer hours and
lines have disappeared.
Because the plan is voluntary,
compliance is difficult to
determine, but McCall and his
staff believe the system is being
used where necessary.
"Motorists feel they have a fair
shot at getting gasoline through
this system," McCall says.

Gasoline dealers discovered
their supplies were running low
just before Christmas and, as the
word spread, motorists began
lining up at gasoline stations to
keep their tanks full for holiday
travel.
Police were forced to patrol
streets near some stations both for
traffic control and protection of
attendants who sometimes were
threatened by irate customers.
Fast Pace
The harried attendants stopped
washing windshields and checking
oil as they concentrated on

getting gas into the tanks. One
dealer suffered a heart attack.
Operating hours became
shorter and shorter as dealers
imposed daily quotas so their
supply would last the month. The
shortage was so severe that traffic
on Portland freeways dropped 20
percent.
When dealers agreed to the
voluntary plan suggested by Gov.
Tom McCall's energy staff early in
January, the problem melted
away as fast as it had developed.
Although gasoline supplies
remain short in Oregon, the plan
clearly is working as stations are
staying open longer hours and
lines have disappeared.
Because the plan is voluntary,
compliance is difficult to
determine, but McCall and his
staff believe the system is being
used where necessary.
"Motorists feel they have a fair
shot at getting gasoline through
this system," McCall says.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Oregon's
new gasoline allocation program
has become the butt of countless
jokes, but the last laugh is on the
unbelievers.
Under the voluntary system,
which took effect early this
month, Oregon motorists with
odd-numbered license plates buy
gasoline on odd-numbered
calendar days and those with
even-numbered plates on
even-numbered days.

Typical of the humor inspired
by the system was a sign at the
local Marion County Public
Welfare office when the
Willamette River flooded
restrooms recently.
The sign said a substitute privy
could be used, depending upon a
person's Social Security umber
and whether the number was odd
or even — even numbers for the
a.m., odd numbers for the p.m.
System Works
The jokes have not obscured
one thing, however. The system is
working. Panic buying has
stopped. The plan already has
spread across the Columbiaßiver
into neighboring southwest
Washington, where gasoline is
equally scarce, and a mandatory
odd-even system went into effect
in Hawaii's Honolulu County on
Monday. Officials think more
states will follow suit if the
gasoline situation becomes more
serious.
Oregon motorists struggled
through three weeks of chaos
before officials devised the plan.
