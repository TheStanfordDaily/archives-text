# Women As Managers 'Just Good Business'
## 
### WENDY QUINONES 
"It's good business to bring
women into management
positions," stated Business School
Asst. Prof. Myra Strober.
Corporations which continue to
discriminate against women are
faced not only with lawsuits, but
also with losing talented women
who will be hired by their
competition, she said.
Strober spoke on "Bringing
Women Into Management
Positions" at Tuesday's YWCA
Sandwich Series lecture. She will
also speak on "The American
Woman At Work" today at noon
in Room 87 of the Business
School, the first speaker in a series
sponsored by the Committee for
Research on Women.
"It's just good business to
utilize the best talent available,
whether it's male or female,"
Strober said. Corporations
complain of a small pool of skilled

labor to fill top management
positions," she said. "Bringing
women up through the pipeline
into these positions is one way of
increasing the pool," she added.
But women face special
problems in reaching management
positions, Strober said, because
many spend the middle years of
their lives — between ages of 25
and 40 — raising children. During
those same years, men are
acquiring the management
experience that allows them to
move into top positions.
Strober added that many
women work in areas largely
untapped by corporations looking
for women with management
potential. "In volunteer work,
many women hold tough
managerial jobs," Strober
observed, but corporations usually
do not consider volunteer work to
be business experience.
Strober said that many beliefs
about working women, such as
their higher job turnover rate,
don't hold up under close
examination. The turnover rate
for women is similar to the rate
for men in similar job and age
categories, she said.
A corporation which is
committed to hiring women for
management positions has a
difficult job, Stober said. Top
company management must be
intensely involved in the process,
which involves planning both
short- and long-term strategies.
Strober pointed out that
corporation presidents too often
issue general policy statements
and leave implementation up to
the personnel department. "That's
when the trouble starts," she said.
Women are in a good position
now, Strober said, to push for
affirmative action policies at
companies where they are
employed. "Corporations don't
have any choice any more,
because laws have changed,"
Strober said. "They're being sued
left and right, and they want to
avoid suits."

committed to hiring women for
management positions has a
difficult job, Stober said. Top
company management must be
intensely involved in the process,
which involves planning both
short- and long-term strategies.
Strober pointed out that
corporation presidents too often
issue general policy statements
and leave implementation up to
the personnel department. "That's
when the trouble starts," she said.
Women are in a good position
now, Strober said, to push for
affirmative action policies at
companies where they are
employed. "Corporations don't
have any choice any more,
because laws have changed,"
Strober said. "They're being sued
left and right, and they want to
avoid suits."
"It's good business to bring
women into management
positions," stated Business School
Asst. Prof. Myra Strober.
Corporations which continue to
discriminate against women are
faced not only with lawsuits, but
also with losing talented women
who will be hired by their
competition, she said.
Strober spoke on "Bringing
Women Into Management
Positions" at Tuesday's YWCA
Sandwich Series lecture. She will
also speak on "The American
Woman At Work" today at noon
in Room 87 of the Business
School, the first speaker in a series
sponsored by the Committee for
Research on Women.
"It's just good business to
utilize the best talent available,
whether it's male or female,"
Strober said. Corporations
complain of a small pool of skilled

labor to fill top management
positions," she said. "Bringing
women up through the pipeline
into these positions is one way of
increasing the pool," she added.
But women face special
problems in reaching management
positions, Strober said, because
many spend the middle years of
their lives — between ages of 25
and 40 — raising children. During
those same years, men are
acquiring the management
experience that allows them to
move into top positions.
Strober added that many
women work in areas largely
untapped by corporations looking
for women with management
potential. "In volunteer work,
many women hold tough
managerial jobs," Strober
observed, but corporations usually
do not consider volunteer work to
be business experience.
Strober said that many beliefs
about working women, such as
their higher job turnover rate,
don't hold up under close
examination. The turnover rate
for women is similar to the rate
for men in similar job and age
categories, she said.
