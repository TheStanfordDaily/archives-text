# University Solicits Support For 'Steady State' Priorities
## 
### TERRY ANZUR Last Of Three Parts 
"During the 60s, Stanford started
new programs with insufficient
funding in sight," recalls Vice Provost
for Research William F. Massey. "That
was all right as long as we were
growing. Now that we're in a steady
state, we're a lot tougher in our
planning."
Faced with a bottleneck in the flow
of federal support, a "national
phenomenon" of restricted giving
from private sources, a serious
shortage of endowment and
skyrocketing educational costs,
Stanford has lost what President

Richard Lyman calls "the old
unquestioning self-confidence.
"The clear and unclouded
conviction that what we are doing is
important and will therefore be
supported is gone," Lyman says.
"Most of us still firmly believe that
our mission is important, but we're
not so sure that the rest of the country
thinks so, and we're worried about
support."
Forced to be selective about where
limited resources will be spent, the
University is just as choosy about what
kinds of contributions it will accept.
Indiscriminate acceptance of
outside support during the 50s and 60s

has intensified the effect of the
academic depression of the 70s. One
university found itself supporting a
massive highway research institute
with precious unrestricted money after
federal support for the program was
cut off.
Stanford, too, has been required to
"use its limited general funds to
maintain the fixed volume of
departments whose volume [of
support] has declined," says
Vice President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger.
The Gift Opportunities Program
involves the General Secretary's
Office,, the provost's office and
University departments in an effort to
keep unessentials out of the budget.
Whether a gift request becomes a
gift opportunity depends upon the
projected future utility of the
program, how well it fits in with
existing programs and "whether or not
it is something we can raise money
for," Massey says.
Pat Devaney, assistant to the
vice-provost, explains that an
important distinction is made between
incremental and non-incremental
programs. Non-incremental programs
receive higher priority because they
enrich or maintain existing programs,
she says.
The future of the Values,
Technology, and Society Program, for
example, depends upon whether or
not it is judged incremental or
non-in ere mental when it is reviewed
within the next few years. If found
non-incremental, it will receive
support from general funds when the
present foundation grant that now
supports it expires.
"We aren't unwilling to
experiment," says Massey. "We just
