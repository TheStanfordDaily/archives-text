# TV's 'Mr. Sulu' Urges Involvement
## 
### JOHN SULLIVAN 
"We have to educate our
community to realize that
Asian-American is a political
concept," George Takei, TV actor
turned political candidate, told a
largely Asian student audience in
Junipero lounge last night.
He emphasized the need for
Japanese, Chinese, Phillipinos, and
other Asians to have a common
political involvement, in a talk
and discussion about
"Asian-Americans and the
political process."
Takei urged the students to
begin with voter registration
drives, stating that "the game of
politics is the game of having a
base."
George Takei is known to
many TV-viewers as "Mr. Sulu" of
the "Star Trek" TV series. A
veteran film and TV actor, he ran
for the Los Angeles City Council
last summer, in Mayor Tom
Bradley's former district, and lost
by three percent of the vote. A
liberal Democrat, Takei said of his
candidacy, "I did enjoy that
experience, no matter how
brutalizing it was."
Takei said that
Asian-Americans have been more
victims than beneficiaries of
government and the political
process until recently. He briefly
summarized the history of Asians

in America, pointing out that for
most of that history they had no
political power. "All the
legislation was passed at the cost
of the Asian-Americans," he said.
He referred to his own
candidacy as an example of how
to get results from the political
process. A registration drive

brought in 1,000 new voters in
two months. Although he lost, his
constituency was heard. "We'll get
politicians to start designing their
issues more towards the
perspective of Asians," Takei said.
Welfare administrators are not
helping the Asian-Americans on
welfare understand the program,

Takei claimed. These people are
agricultural workers and older
people who have little or no
command of English, he said.
Takei told his audience that
efforts to represent Asian
concerns in politics must begin
with voter registration. "Voting is
an area where a lot of Asians

aren't participating," he said.
Takei suggested that Asians
become involved in precinct and
party politics by entering clubs
and organizations.
"Once these levels are entered,
this makes possible the emergence
of Asian-American candidacies,"
Takei said. "I'm looking forward
to the day when we have a ballot,
not with one, but with many
Asian names on it."
Takei acknowledged that his
ideas on consciousness and
politics are influenced by the
example of black politics. "I think
we are beneficiaries of the
program made by the black
movement." He considered the
political position of the two
minorities analogous.
Asked what role he assigns to
the media in the Asian-American
political process, Takei pointed
out that "the media and the
political process overlay." Access
to the general public is essential
for the airing of issues and the
exposure of candidates and artists,
he explained.
His own career as an actor
went from stereotype roles to
"Star Trek" and his own talk
show. He felt that his part in
"Star Trek" was important,
because it gave the viewers a
glimpse of the future â€” a united
Earth represented by the crew of
the starship.
