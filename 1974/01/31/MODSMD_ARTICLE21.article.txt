Leah Kaplan, psychiatric social worker in
counseling and psychological services at the
University has been named assistant to the Dean of
Student Affairs for women students, effective
tomorrow for a two-year period.
Her selection was announced Tuesday by Dean
James Lyons.
A graduate of Minnesota (B.A. 1943) and Smith
College of Social Work (M.S.S. 1946), she also has
studied at Yale and Chicago and has been on the
Cowell Student Health Services staff here since
1965.
The first woman staffer on the psychiatric staff
at Cowell, she has provided extensive counseling on
unplanned pregnancy and sexual difficulties and
was instrumental in development of the center's
booklet on student health care, People Should Feel
Good.
Kaplan also helped establish and supervise an
intern program for social work students from the
Berkeley School of Social Welfare.
A former member of the subcommittee on
advising of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS), she served last year on its

1 1
subcommittee on entering studei ts.
Her new position stems from a recommendation
last May by the Committee on Education and
Employment for Women for appointment of a
consultant on women students.
At that time Asst. Prof. Mathea Allansmith,
surgery, CEEW head, said: "Although the best
long-range plan for bringing issues on women at
Stanford into a more modern balance is doing this
through the regular faculty-administrative
setup ... the process of change needs some help in
recognizing where the problems are."
In her new position, Kaplan will be responsible
for identifying and organizing a network or
networks of people at the University who have a
special awareness and sensitivity to the needs and
problems of women students, bringing them
together to help them act on their common
concerns in an effective and informed manner.
She will devote the major portion of her time to
her new position at the outset, reviewing it with the
dean after one and two-year intervals. She will
maintain offices both at Cowell and the third floor
of the Old Union.
