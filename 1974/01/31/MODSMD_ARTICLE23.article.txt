# Guitarist Gordon Lightfoot
## 'Continually Getting Better' 
### KEVIN SMITH 
BERKELEY — The rugged
looking man with the curly, dark
red hair strolled onto the stage.
Aided by the six- and 12-string
guitars he played himself and by
his two backup men sitting
unobtrusively behind him, the
man sang four songs in immediate
succession without saying a word
to the audience.
Only one of the four songs was
familiar to most of those listening,
the other three coming from an
album just released last month.
Usually unfamiliar songs receive a
polite but impatient reception
from an audience waiting to hear
old favorites. Yet the capacity
crowd at the Berkeley
Community Theater last Thursday
became instantly spellbound with
the first words and sounds from
the stage.
Gordon Lightfoot can do that
to you.
His never-ending freshness, his
penetrating rich voice and his
ability to write countless
unforgettable songs make
Lightfoot the most talented solo
male singer-composer currently
performing. And, incredibly, he is
continually getting better.
Unusually Infectious
Lightfoot's tunes are unusually
infectious: they are the kind that
stick with his listeners even after
having been heard only a couple
of times. They are the kind of
songs that physically affect the
listener's emotions.
Although Lightfoot is normally
classified as a "folk" singer for
want of a better label, he is really
much more than that. A
well-travelled native of Canada,
Lightfoot's music is a composite
of every mile and every situation
he has encountered.
It is trite to say that he sings
and writes about "life," but the
neat thing about Lightfoot is that
he does precisely that in a way
that is both original and not the
least bit phony.
As he demonstrated in
Berkeley, Lightfoot can rattle off
four straight songs without saying
a word and absolutely enchant his
audience. Yet he is far from being
an aloof performer. He did, in
fact, begin chatting with the
audience frequently after the first
several songs, but even while
saying nothing, Lightfoot
communicates through his songs
in such a way that his audience
feels right at home from the
outset.
Before The Fireplace
When Lightfoot performs, it is
just as if the entire audience were
sitting in a warm log cabin
listening to him play for a few
friends in front of the fireplace.
He is one of the few performers
who can be both folksy and cool

at the same time.
The unfamiliar songs he began
with during his sensational
two-hour concert were from his
new album Sundown which, at
first hearing, seems as original and
emotion-twisting as the string of
albums that preceded it.
He began the show with the
lively "The List" from Sundown
and followed that with one of his
most popular songs, "Alberta
Bound," which gave the audience
a sample of the more familiar
material to come.
Still not saying anything,
Lightfoot added "High and Dry"
and the haunting "Seven Island
Suite," both from the new album.
Then with a simple "Thank
you" — his first words to the
audience — he plunged into a
picture-perfect rendition of
"Cotton Jenny." a perky amusing
song with a country flavor. His
lead acoustic guitarist, Terry
Clements, provided a great
accompaniment to Lightfoot's
guitar on this song with the two
intertwining expertly.
Another new song,
"Somewhere U.S.A." preceded his
tremendously popular "Don
Quixote" from the album of the
same name. This song in particular
exposes the incredible richness of
Lightfoot's voice. The song may
be slightly too moralistic and trite
— Lightfoot can get that way once
in a great while — but any
deficiency is far overshadowed by
the song's lilting melody and
Lightfoot's unparalleled singing
ability.
AM Hits
Lightfoot pleased the audience
with a version of "If You Could
Read My Mind," his first AM
radio hit which climbed the charts
in 1971.
The bass guitar on "Ode to Big
Blue" — an epic song about a huge
whale who lords over the Pacific
Ocean — was especially
noteworthy and drew attention to
Lightfoot's bass guitarist, Rick
Haynes.
Toward the end of the first
half of the concert, Lightfoot
treated the crowd to a stunning
rendition of the title song from
Sundown. Lightfoot's title cuts
always seem to be even better
than his average, and the song
"Sundown" is possibly even more
superb than his three previous
title cuts, "Old Dan's Records,"
"Don Quixote" and "Summer
Side of Life," which is saying
quite a lot.
He then moved to "Circle of
Steel" from the new album which
is unfortunately a little maudlin.
Most of his lyrics are moving
enough to melt glaciers, but
sometimes his social commentary
lyrics on topics like welfare and
poverty rankle a little bit.

He finished the first half with
"Old Dan's Records" — a barn
dance song which shows off
Lightfoot's versatility well — and
his often-performed,
never-recorded "Auction Song" in
which he brilliantly mimics the
barely intelligible fast-talking of
an auctioneer.
After a 20-minute intermission,
Lightfoot returned with the soft
love song "Beautiful" — a song
with a self-descriptive title.
Second Half
The remainder of the second
half featured a wide variety of
songs including two of this
reviewer's all-time favorites: 'Ten
Degrees and Getting Colder" —
the real hitchhiker's hitching song
— and "On Susan's Floor" — one
of the greatest mood songs ever
which was written by Shel
Silvers tein.
Lightfoot finished his main set
with one of his most famous older
songs, "Canadian Railway
Trilogy." Each time he sang the
chorus, which begins "Over the
mountains and over the

plains ..he would start very
slowly and agonizingly to portray
a very realistic image of a big
steam locomotive struggling up
the mountains. As the train
supposedly speeds up after it gets
over the mountains, Lightfoot
gradually increased the speed of
the chorus to produce a neat
effect.
He came back for one encore,
"Too Late for Prayin'," a slow,
quiet song from the new album.
He tried to let the audience down
slowly with this encore, but after
two hours and 25 songs, the
partially standing crowd still
wouldn't let him go without
booming applause and hopes for a
second encore.
The greatest solo male
singer-composer of our time came
back to take a bow and say
goodnight. And as one spectator,
who had never even heard one of
Lightfoot's albums before the
concert, exclaimed, "I've never
seen two hours go by that
quickly!"

the song's lilting melody and
Lightfoot's unparalleled singing
ability.
AM Hits
Lightfoot pleased the audience
with a version of "If You Could
Read My Mind," his first AM
radio hit which climbed the charts
in 1971.
The bass guitar on "Ode to Big
Blue" — an epic song about a huge
whale who lords over the Pacific
Ocean — was especially
noteworthy and drew attention to
Lightfoot's bass guitarist, Rick
Haynes.
Toward the end of the first
half of the concert, Lightfoot
treated the crowd to a stunning
rendition of the title song from
Sundown. Lightfoot's title cuts
always seem to be even better
than his average, and the song
"Sundown" is possibly even more
superb than his three previous
title cuts, "Old Dan's Records,"
"Don Quixote" and "Summer
Side of Life," which is saying
quite a lot.
He then moved to "Circle of
Steel" from the new album which
is unfortunately a little maudlin.
Most of his lyrics are moving
enough to melt glaciers, but
sometimes his social commentary
lyrics on topics like welfare and
poverty rankle a little bit.

He finished the first half with
"Old Dan's Records" — a barn
dance song which shows off
Lightfoot's versatility well — and
his often-performed,
never-recorded "Auction Song" in
which he brilliantly mimics the
barely intelligible fast-talking of
an auctioneer.
After a 20-minute intermission,
Lightfoot returned with the soft
love song "Beautiful" — a song
with a self-descriptive title.
Second Half
The remainder of the second
half featured a wide variety of
songs including two of this
reviewer's all-time favorites: 'Ten
Degrees and Getting Colder" —
the real hitchhiker's hitching song
— and "On Susan's Floor" — one
of the greatest mood songs ever
which was written by Shel
Silvers tein.
Lightfoot finished his main set
with one of his most famous older
songs, "Canadian Railway
Trilogy." Each time he sang the
chorus, which begins "Over the
mountains and over the

plains ..he would start very
slowly and agonizingly to portray
a very realistic image of a big
steam locomotive struggling up
the mountains. As the train
supposedly speeds up after it gets
over the mountains, Lightfoot
gradually increased the speed of
the chorus to produce a neat
effect.
He came back for one encore,
"Too Late for Prayin'," a slow,
quiet song from the new album.
He tried to let the audience down
slowly with this encore, but after
two hours and 25 songs, the
partially standing crowd still
wouldn't let him go without
booming applause and hopes for a
second encore.
The greatest solo male
singer-composer of our time came
back to take a bow and say
goodnight. And as one spectator,
who had never even heard one of
Lightfoot's albums before the
concert, exclaimed, "I've never
seen two hours go by that
quickly!"

DOBBY'S ADIEU — Outgoing Daily Entertainment Editor George Dobbins (inset) couldn't find a photo
of Gordon Lightfoot, so he tried to substitute one of Prince Lightfoot. However, that photo turned out
too gray, so here is a picture of the Dollies. You figure it out.
BERKELEY — The rugged
looking man with the curly, dark
red hair strolled onto the stage.
Aided by the six- and 12-string
guitars he played himself and by
his two backup men sitting
unobtrusively behind him, the
man sang four songs in immediate
succession without saying a word
to the audience.
Only one of the four songs was
familiar to most of those listening,
the other three coming from an
album just released last month.
Usually unfamiliar songs receive a
polite but impatient reception
from an audience waiting to hear
old favorites. Yet the capacity
crowd at the Berkeley
Community Theater last Thursday
became instantly spellbound with
the first words and sounds from
the stage.
Gordon Lightfoot can do that
to you.
His never-ending freshness, his
penetrating rich voice and his
ability to write countless
unforgettable songs make
Lightfoot the most talented solo
male singer-composer currently
performing. And, incredibly, he is
continually getting better.
Unusually Infectious
Lightfoot's tunes are unusually
infectious: they are the kind that
stick with his listeners even after
having been heard only a couple
of times. They are the kind of
songs that physically affect the
listener's emotions.
Although Lightfoot is normally
classified as a "folk" singer for
want of a better label, he is really
much more than that. A
well-travelled native of Canada,
Lightfoot's music is a composite
of every mile and every situation
he has encountered.
It is trite to say that he sings
and writes about "life," but the
neat thing about Lightfoot is that
he does precisely that in a way
that is both original and not the
least bit phony.
As he demonstrated in
Berkeley, Lightfoot can rattle off
four straight songs without saying
a word and absolutely enchant his
audience. Yet he is far from being
an aloof performer. He did, in
fact, begin chatting with the
audience frequently after the first
several songs, but even while
saying nothing, Lightfoot
communicates through his songs
in such a way that his audience
feels right at home from the
outset.
Before The Fireplace
When Lightfoot performs, it is
just as if the entire audience were
sitting in a warm log cabin
listening to him play for a few
friends in front of the fireplace.
He is one of the few performers
who can be both folksy and cool

at the same time.
The unfamiliar songs he began
with during his sensational
two-hour concert were from his
new album Sundown which, at
first hearing, seems as original and
emotion-twisting as the string of
albums that preceded it.
He began the show with the
lively "The List" from Sundown
and followed that with one of his
most popular songs, "Alberta
Bound," which gave the audience
a sample of the more familiar
material to come.
Still not saying anything,
Lightfoot added "High and Dry"
and the haunting "Seven Island
Suite," both from the new album.
Then with a simple "Thank
you" — his first words to the
audience — he plunged into a
picture-perfect rendition of
"Cotton Jenny." a perky amusing
song with a country flavor. His
lead acoustic guitarist, Terry
Clements, provided a great
accompaniment to Lightfoot's
guitar on this song with the two
intertwining expertly.
Another new song,
"Somewhere U.S.A." preceded his
tremendously popular "Don
Quixote" from the album of the
same name. This song in particular
exposes the incredible richness of
Lightfoot's voice. The song may
be slightly too moralistic and trite
— Lightfoot can get that way once
in a great while — but any
deficiency is far overshadowed by
the song's lilting melody and
Lightfoot's unparalleled singing
ability.

Only one of the four songs was
familiar to most of those listening,
the other three coming from an
album just released last month.
Usually unfamiliar songs receive a
polite but impatient reception
from an audience waiting to hear
old favorites. Yet the capacity
crowd at the Berkeley
Community Theater last Thursday
became instantly spellbound with
the first words and sounds from
the stage.
Gordon Lightfoot can do that
to you.
His never-ending freshness, his
penetrating rich voice and his
ability to write countless
unforgettable songs make
Lightfoot the most talented solo
male singer-composer currently
performing. And, incredibly, he is
continually getting better.
Unusually Infectious
Lightfoot's tunes are unusually
infectious: they are the kind that
stick with his listeners even after
having been heard only a couple
of times. They are the kind of
songs that physically affect the
listener's emotions.
Although Lightfoot is normally
classified as a "folk" singer for
want of a better label, he is really
much more than that. A
well-travelled native of Canada,
Lightfoot's music is a composite
of every mile and every situation
he has encountered.
It is trite to say that he sings
and writes about "life," but the
neat thing about Lightfoot is that
he does precisely that in a way
that is both original and not the
least bit phony.
As he demonstrated in
Berkeley, Lightfoot can rattle off
four straight songs without saying
a word and absolutely enchant his
audience. Yet he is far from being
an aloof performer. He did, in
fact, begin chatting with the
audience frequently after the first
several songs, but even while
saying nothing, Lightfoot
communicates through his songs
in such a way that his audience
feels right at home from the
outset.
Before The Fireplace
When Lightfoot performs, it is
just as if the entire audience were
sitting in a warm log cabin
listening to him play for a few
friends in front of the fireplace.
He is one of the few performers
who can be both folksy and cool

at the same time.
The unfamiliar songs he began
with during his sensational
two-hour concert were from his
new album Sundown which, at
first hearing, seems as original and
emotion-twisting as the string of
albums that preceded it.
He began the show with the
lively "The List" from Sundown
and followed that with one of his
most popular songs, "Alberta
Bound," which gave the audience
a sample of the more familiar
material to come.
Still not saying anything,
Lightfoot added "High and Dry"
and the haunting "Seven Island
Suite," both from the new album.
Then with a simple "Thank
you" — his first words to the
audience — he plunged into a
picture-perfect rendition of
"Cotton Jenny." a perky amusing
song with a country flavor. His
lead acoustic guitarist, Terry
Clements, provided a great
accompaniment to Lightfoot's
guitar on this song with the two
intertwining expertly.
Another new song,
"Somewhere U.S.A." preceded his
tremendously popular "Don
Quixote" from the album of the
same name. This song in particular
exposes the incredible richness of
Lightfoot's voice. The song may
be slightly too moralistic and trite
— Lightfoot can get that way once
in a great while — but any
deficiency is far overshadowed by
the song's lilting melody and
Lightfoot's unparalleled singing
ability.
AM Hits
Lightfoot pleased the audience
with a version of "If You Could
Read My Mind," his first AM
radio hit which climbed the charts
in 1971.
The bass guitar on "Ode to Big
Blue" — an epic song about a huge
whale who lords over the Pacific
Ocean — was especially
noteworthy and drew attention to
Lightfoot's bass guitarist, Rick
Haynes.
Toward the end of the first
half of the concert, Lightfoot
treated the crowd to a stunning
rendition of the title song from
Sundown. Lightfoot's title cuts
always seem to be even better
than his average, and the song
"Sundown" is possibly even more
superb than his three previous
title cuts, "Old Dan's Records,"
"Don Quixote" and "Summer
Side of Life," which is saying
quite a lot.
He then moved to "Circle of
Steel" from the new album which
is unfortunately a little maudlin.
Most of his lyrics are moving
enough to melt glaciers, but
sometimes his social commentary
lyrics on topics like welfare and
poverty rankle a little bit.

He finished the first half with
"Old Dan's Records" — a barn
dance song which shows off
Lightfoot's versatility well — and
his often-performed,
never-recorded "Auction Song" in
which he brilliantly mimics the
barely intelligible fast-talking of
an auctioneer.
After a 20-minute intermission,
Lightfoot returned with the soft
love song "Beautiful" — a song
with a self-descriptive title.
Second Half
The remainder of the second
half featured a wide variety of
songs including two of this
reviewer's all-time favorites: 'Ten
Degrees and Getting Colder" —
the real hitchhiker's hitching song
— and "On Susan's Floor" — one
of the greatest mood songs ever
which was written by Shel
Silvers tein.
Lightfoot finished his main set
with one of his most famous older
songs, "Canadian Railway
Trilogy." Each time he sang the
chorus, which begins "Over the
mountains and over the

plains ..he would start very
slowly and agonizingly to portray
a very realistic image of a big
steam locomotive struggling up
the mountains. As the train
supposedly speeds up after it gets
over the mountains, Lightfoot
gradually increased the speed of
the chorus to produce a neat
effect.
He came back for one encore,
"Too Late for Prayin'," a slow,
quiet song from the new album.
He tried to let the audience down
slowly with this encore, but after
two hours and 25 songs, the
partially standing crowd still
wouldn't let him go without
booming applause and hopes for a
second encore.
The greatest solo male
singer-composer of our time came
back to take a bow and say
goodnight. And as one spectator,
who had never even heard one of
Lightfoot's albums before the
concert, exclaimed, "I've never
seen two hours go by that
quickly!"

BERKELEY — The rugged

Ocean — was especially
noteworthy and drew attention to
Lightfoot's bass guitarist, Rick
Haynes.
Toward the end of the first
half of the concert, Lightfoot
treated the crowd to a stunning
rendition of the title song from
Sundown. Lightfoot's title cuts
always seem to be even better
than his average, and the song
"Sundown" is possibly even more
superb than his three previous
title cuts, "Old Dan's Records,"
"Don Quixote" and "Summer
Side of Life," which is saying
quite a lot.
He then moved to "Circle of
Steel" from the new album which
is unfortunately a little maudlin.
Most of his lyrics are moving
enough to melt glaciers, but
sometimes his social commentary
lyrics on topics like welfare and
poverty rankle a little bit.

He finished the first half with
"Old Dan's Records" — a barn
dance song which shows off
Lightfoot's versatility well — and
his often-performed,
never-recorded "Auction Song" in
which he brilliantly mimics the
barely intelligible fast-talking of
an auctioneer.
After a 20-minute intermission,
Lightfoot returned with the soft
love song "Beautiful" — a song
with a self-descriptive title.
Second Half
The remainder of the second
half featured a wide variety of
songs including two of this
reviewer's all-time favorites: 'Ten
Degrees and Getting Colder" —
the real hitchhiker's hitching song
— and "On Susan's Floor" — one
of the greatest mood songs ever
which was written by Shel
Silvers tein.
Lightfoot finished his main set
with one of his most famous older
songs, "Canadian Railway
Trilogy." Each time he sang the
chorus, which begins "Over the
mountains and over the

plains ..he would start very
slowly and agonizingly to portray
a very realistic image of a big
steam locomotive struggling up
the mountains. As the train
supposedly speeds up after it gets
over the mountains, Lightfoot
gradually increased the speed of
the chorus to produce a neat
effect.
He came back for one encore,
"Too Late for Prayin'," a slow,
quiet song from the new album.
He tried to let the audience down
slowly with this encore, but after
two hours and 25 songs, the
partially standing crowd still
wouldn't let him go without
booming applause and hopes for a
second encore.
The greatest solo male
singer-composer of our time came
back to take a bow and say
goodnight. And as one spectator,
who had never even heard one of
Lightfoot's albums before the
concert, exclaimed, "I've never
seen two hours go by that
quickly!"

DOBBY'S ADIEU — Outgoing Daily Entertainment Editor George Dobbins (inset) couldn't find a photo

too gray, so here is a picture of the Dollies. You figure it out.
BERKELEY — The rugged
looking man with the curly, dark
red hair strolled onto the stage.
Aided by the six- and 12-string
guitars he played himself and by
his two backup men sitting
unobtrusively behind him, the
man sang four songs in immediate
succession without saying a word
to the audience.
Only one of the four songs was
familiar to most of those listening,
the other three coming from an
album just released last month.
Usually unfamiliar songs receive a
polite but impatient reception
from an audience waiting to hear
old favorites. Yet the capacity
crowd at the Berkeley
Community Theater last Thursday
became instantly spellbound with
the first words and sounds from
the stage.
Gordon Lightfoot can do that
to you.
His never-ending freshness, his
penetrating rich voice and his
ability to write countless
unforgettable songs make
Lightfoot the most talented solo
male singer-composer currently
performing. And, incredibly, he is
continually getting better.
Unusually Infectious
Lightfoot's tunes are unusually
infectious: they are the kind that
stick with his listeners even after
having been heard only a couple
of times. They are the kind of
songs that physically affect the
listener's emotions.
Although Lightfoot is normally
classified as a "folk" singer for
want of a better label, he is really
much more than that. A
well-travelled native of Canada,
Lightfoot's music is a composite
of every mile and every situation
he has encountered.
It is trite to say that he sings
and writes about "life," but the
neat thing about Lightfoot is that
he does precisely that in a way
that is both original and not the
least bit phony.
As he demonstrated in
Berkeley, Lightfoot can rattle off
four straight songs without saying
a word and absolutely enchant his
audience. Yet he is far from being
an aloof performer. He did, in
fact, begin chatting with the
audience frequently after the first
several songs, but even while
saying nothing, Lightfoot
communicates through his songs
in such a way that his audience
feels right at home from the
outset.
Before The Fireplace
When Lightfoot performs, it is
just as if the entire audience were
sitting in a warm log cabin
listening to him play for a few
friends in front of the fireplace.
He is one of the few performers
who can be both folksy and cool

at the same time.
The unfamiliar songs he began
with during his sensational
two-hour concert were from his
new album Sundown which, at
first hearing, seems as original and
emotion-twisting as the string of
albums that preceded it.
He began the show with the
lively "The List" from Sundown
and followed that with one of his
most popular songs, "Alberta
Bound," which gave the audience
a sample of the more familiar
material to come.
Still not saying anything,
Lightfoot added "High and Dry"
and the haunting "Seven Island
Suite," both from the new album.
Then with a simple "Thank
you" — his first words to the
audience — he plunged into a
picture-perfect rendition of
"Cotton Jenny." a perky amusing
song with a country flavor. His
lead acoustic guitarist, Terry
Clements, provided a great
accompaniment to Lightfoot's
guitar on this song with the two
intertwining expertly.
Another new song,
"Somewhere U.S.A." preceded his
tremendously popular "Don
Quixote" from the album of the
same name. This song in particular
exposes the incredible richness of
Lightfoot's voice. The song may
be slightly too moralistic and trite
— Lightfoot can get that way once
in a great while — but any
deficiency is far overshadowed by
the song's lilting melody and
Lightfoot's unparalleled singing
ability.
AM Hits
Lightfoot pleased the audience
with a version of "If You Could
Read My Mind," his first AM
radio hit which climbed the charts
in 1971.
The bass guitar on "Ode to Big
Blue" — an epic song about a huge
whale who lords over the Pacific
Ocean — was especially
noteworthy and drew attention to
Lightfoot's bass guitarist, Rick
Haynes.
Toward the end of the first
half of the concert, Lightfoot
treated the crowd to a stunning

always seem to be even better

"Sundown" is possibly even more
