# 'The Exorcist': Nauseating And Frightening
## 
### GENE RICHIE 
What tightropes on the verge of
being a significant psychological
rite falls off into sensationalism,
frolic and cheap thrills. "The
Exorcist," a family story about a
twelve-year-old girl possessed by
the Devil and two priests who try
to exorcise the demon, intimates
the more complex rendering of a
rite ruled by a grotesque feminine
deity.
"You take a ride on the Peak
of the Craze," remarked senior
John Tepper. That craze
nauseates, frightens and thrills
with the sensation of distorted
realism.
Desert Excavation
The film opens with Father
Merrin (Max Von Sydow), a
priest-scholar excavating in a
desert of Northern Iraq for the
archeological remains of the
demon of evil, popular in statue
form or as a head in the ancient
Sumerian cultures.
With brilliant photography and
control of the image within the
frame the opening scene sets the
evil against evil motif by capturing
two dogs springing viciously at
each others' necks, then jump-cuts
to Von Sydow silhouetted in
stance against a sun-spotted,
shadowy, demon-figure.
McNeil's Demon
The demon which possesses
Regan McNeil in "The Exorcist,"
is of similar nature; a seductive
woman of the night with
bottom-crowd, gross masculine
overtones. The creature is finely

executed with the low droll voice
of Mercedes McCambridge.
The opening scene quickly
shifts to the more realistic
Georgetown family setting: a
movie-star mother and two
daughters and the local parish
priest, Damien Karras (Jason
Miller), a Jesuit psychiatric
counselor about ready to loose his
faith.
The film moves under director
William Friedkin, who stops at
nothing to shock his audience. A
normal, ouija-board playing child
becomes a feared, beastlike,
growling creature spitting out
vomit. Regan McNeil is portrayed
in the psychological rite as a
violent, blood-thirsty,
crucifix-carrying monster.
You won't want pizza before
or after and bread and water
might be too much. Northpoint
ticket collectors in San Francisco
recount fainting and indigestion at
most every performance.
William Peter Blatty, author of
the book The Exorcist and
adapter of the screen-play calls
the film "an obtuse movie,
without a trace of playfulness in
it." Blatty is a more realistic
though less profound artist of the
perverse than Fellini in

"Satyricon." The repressed
demon of his own passion and
sexuality confronts Karras, a once
stable individual in a social sphere
and a theological graduate of
Harvard.
Exorcism Rite
The quick short shots cutting
from demon to Damien to old
Father Merrin in the exorcism rite
are an excellent supernatural
montage similar in thrill to
the chase scene of the "French
Connection" also directed by
Friedkin, yet here the affect is
more consonant to the psycho
logical rite.
The main psychological action
of the film is between Damien and
the demon. It is only in the final
moments that Damien triumphs,
arousing his dead passion to strike
and strangle the demon. The
demon takes possession of him for
an instant, he returns to normal
and jumps out the window freely
of his own will — some triumph.
Friedkin lets the demon out of
a $10 million felt-lined bag of
tricks from levitating to swivelling
heads. He has been noted as
claiming, "there are only three
reasons to make a movie, to make
people laugh, to make them cry,
or to frighten them."

The film is made of the real
stuff of life, an actual case of a
young boy possessed. Such is the
reason for the blatant rite-like
nature of a Circe, possessed by a
swine-luring, half feminine, half
masculine demon, and the
innocent, cartoon-Christ,
Odyssean figure who confronts
the ball clenching demon.
"The Exorcist," reeks of a
decayed sensuality riding just
above the violence of a psychotic

nightmare. As in Bergman's
"Rite," there is an internal
violence which is emotional and
physical, a masochistic laceration
of the vagina with a crucifix and
the homicidal confrontation of
Regan McNeil with her mother.
The frolic is malicious, cutting
deep into a cross-section of
human tragedy and death. There is
no cleaning in the catharsis, only a
shifting of the dirt.

stance against a sun-spotted,
shadowy, demon-figure.
McNeil's Demon
The demon which possesses
Regan McNeil in "The Exorcist,"
is of similar nature; a seductive
woman of the night with
bottom-crowd, gross masculine
overtones. The creature is finely

executed with the low droll voice
of Mercedes McCambridge.
The opening scene quickly
shifts to the more realistic
Georgetown family setting: a
movie-star mother and two
daughters and the local parish
priest, Damien Karras (Jason
Miller), a Jesuit psychiatric
counselor about ready to loose his
faith.
The film moves under director
William Friedkin, who stops at
nothing to shock his audience. A
normal, ouija-board playing child
becomes a feared, beastlike,
growling creature spitting out
vomit. Regan McNeil is portrayed
in the psychological rite as a
violent, blood-thirsty,
crucifix-carrying monster.
You won't want pizza before
or after and bread and water
might be too much. Northpoint
ticket collectors in San Francisco
recount fainting and indigestion at
most every performance.
William Peter Blatty, author of
the book The Exorcist and
adapter of the screen-play calls
the film "an obtuse movie,
without a trace of playfulness in
it." Blatty is a more realistic
though less profound artist of the
perverse than Fellini in

"Satyricon." The repressed
demon of his own passion and
sexuality confronts Karras, a once
stable individual in a social sphere
and a theological graduate of
Harvard.
Exorcism Rite
The quick short shots cutting
from demon to Damien to old
Father Merrin in the exorcism rite
are an excellent supernatural
montage similar in thrill to
the chase scene of the "French
Connection" also directed by
Friedkin, yet here the affect is
more consonant to the psycho
logical rite.
The main psychological action
of the film is between Damien and
the demon. It is only in the final
moments that Damien triumphs,
arousing his dead passion to strike
and strangle the demon. The
demon takes possession of him for
an instant, he returns to normal
and jumps out the window freely
of his own will — some triumph.
Friedkin lets the demon out of
a $10 million felt-lined bag of
tricks from levitating to swivelling
heads. He has been noted as
claiming, "there are only three
reasons to make a movie, to make
people laugh, to make them cry,
or to frighten them."

The film is made of the real
stuff of life, an actual case of a
young boy possessed. Such is the
reason for the blatant rite-like
nature of a Circe, possessed by a
swine-luring, half feminine, half
masculine demon, and the
innocent, cartoon-Christ,
Odyssean figure who confronts
the ball clenching demon.
"The Exorcist," reeks of a
decayed sensuality riding just
above the violence of a psychotic

nightmare. As in Bergman's
"Rite," there is an internal
violence which is emotional and
physical, a masochistic laceration
of the vagina with a crucifix and
the homicidal confrontation of
Regan McNeil with her mother.
The frolic is malicious, cutting
deep into a cross-section of
human tragedy and death. There is
no cleaning in the catharsis, only a
shifting of the dirt.
What tightropes on the verge of
being a significant psychological
rite falls off into sensationalism,
frolic and cheap thrills. "The
Exorcist," a family story about a
twelve-year-old girl possessed by
the Devil and two priests who try
to exorcise the demon, intimates
the more complex rendering of a
rite ruled by a grotesque feminine
deity.
"You take a ride on the Peak
of the Craze," remarked senior
John Tepper. That craze
nauseates, frightens and thrills
with the sensation of distorted
realism.
Desert Excavation
The film opens with Father
Merrin (Max Von Sydow), a
priest-scholar excavating in a
desert of Northern Iraq for the
archeological remains of the
demon of evil, popular in statue
form or as a head in the ancient
Sumerian cultures.
With brilliant photography and
control of the image within the
frame the opening scene sets the
evil against evil motif by capturing
two dogs springing viciously at
each others' necks, then jump-cuts
to Von Sydow silhouetted in
stance against a sun-spotted,
shadowy, demon-figure.

William Peter Blatty, author of
the book The Exorcist and
adapter of the screen-play calls
the film "an obtuse movie,
without a trace of playfulness in
it." Blatty is a more realistic
though less profound artist of the
perverse than Fellini in

"Satyricon." The repressed
demon of his own passion and
sexuality confronts Karras, a once
stable individual in a social sphere
and a theological graduate of
Harvard.
Exorcism Rite
The quick short shots cutting
from demon to Damien to old
Father Merrin in the exorcism rite
are an excellent supernatural
montage similar in thrill to
the chase scene of the "French
Connection" also directed by
Friedkin, yet here the affect is
more consonant to the psycho
logical rite.
The main psychological action
of the film is between Damien and
the demon. It is only in the final
moments that Damien triumphs,
arousing his dead passion to strike
and strangle the demon. The
demon takes possession of him for
an instant, he returns to normal
and jumps out the window freely
of his own will — some triumph.
Friedkin lets the demon out of
a $10 million felt-lined bag of
tricks from levitating to swivelling
heads. He has been noted as
claiming, "there are only three
reasons to make a movie, to make
people laugh, to make them cry,
or to frighten them."

The film is made of the real
stuff of life, an actual case of a
young boy possessed. Such is the
reason for the blatant rite-like
nature of a Circe, possessed by a
swine-luring, half feminine, half
masculine demon, and the
innocent, cartoon-Christ,
Odyssean figure who confronts
the ball clenching demon.
"The Exorcist," reeks of a
decayed sensuality riding just
above the violence of a psychotic

nightmare. As in Bergman's
"Rite," there is an internal
violence which is emotional and
physical, a masochistic laceration
of the vagina with a crucifix and
the homicidal confrontation of
Regan McNeil with her mother.
The frolic is malicious, cutting
deep into a cross-section of
human tragedy and death. There is
no cleaning in the catharsis, only a
shifting of the dirt.
