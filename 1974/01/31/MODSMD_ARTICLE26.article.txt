# 'Shrew' Makes Delightful Coup
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
The American Conservatory
Theatre production of The
Taming of the Shrew is brilliantly
conceived and superbly realized
on the Geary stage. In the inspired
tradition of the Royal
Shakespeare Company, ACT has
nurtured an imaginative
directorial approach to
Shakespeare with vibrance,
energy, and elan, creating the
most exciting piece of theatre in
the Bay Area, and comparing, in
this instance, quite favorably with
the best of New York, London,
and even Stratford-upon-Avon.
Director William Ball's
delightful coup is a commedia
delVarte approach. Commedia
delVarte was a form of popular
Italian comedy which had its
greatest vogue in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. It was
performed by specially trained
troupes of actors who improvised
on prearranged synopses involving
a group of caricatures and a series
of stock situations.
A National Commedia delVarte
Shrew is such a natural for the
commedia delVarte style that it is
a wonder that it hasn't thusly
appeared before. Written in the
early 1590s when Shakespeare
was but a fledging dramatist,
Shrew has many elements of
caricature in its dramatis
personae.
The fact that Shrew must be
classified as a farce rather than a
comedy lends credence to the
slapstick buffoonery of a
commedia delVarte interpretation.
Certainly the Italian setting of
Padua compliments this as well. In
Petruchio we see a perfect
example of the delVarte
"facchini," witty rogues who
projected greed and shrewdness as
their staple characteristics. In
Grumio and in the other servants,
glimpses the delVarte "deizanni,"
acrobatic and impudent servants.
Actual Slapstick
Ball pulls no punches in his
imitation of Italian Renaissance
troupes. Not only is the action
sprinkled with pratfalls, to the
accompaniment of a percussion
section, but there is actually a
"slapstick" — that's right, the
clap-board that makes the noise —

which finds its way on stage to
punctuate the farce from time to
time. The fair Bianca's suitors,
Gremio and Hortensio, are played
up as the ridiculous caricatures
they are, complete with oversized
shoes a la Ringling Brothers
clowns. The dazzling acrobatic
stunts add to the mood of cricus
frivolity.
Padua!
The cast plunges into Ball's
ideas with great vigor and
enthusiasm. All its members are
on stage throughout the entire
play, sitting around the very
simple central canvas platform on
which all the action takes place
and sharing in its moods.
Whenever Padua is mentioned in
the text the entire company
bursts out with glorious cheer of
"PADUA!" When Bianca sighs
there is a sympathetic chorus of
"aaahhh" from one and all, all of
which reminding us that a
repertory company is still very
much like its Italian renaissance
counterpart. The company's
splendiferous exuberance is
contagious enough to make the
most cynical of sophisticates grin
and guffaw at its slapstick farce.
As in any good company, the
whole of the production is a great
deal more than the sum of its
parts. The subtleties of
"ensemble," that closeness that
makes for impeccable timing, arc
precisely what puts a repertoire
company on a plane of its own.
Nevertheless, the parts were
quite good and deserve some
mention. Marc Singer's very
physical Petruchio was highly
successful and a tribute both to
his talents and to his education in
working his way up through the
ranks in his years with ACT. His
acting talents were only slightly
overshadowed by his ability as
gymnast and acrobat.
Lore Not Servility
Fredi Olster's Katherina was
very good in her role of shrew but
suffered a bit in her transition to a
won-over wife. The interpretation
was correct; she was not defeated
by Petruchio, but sought to please
him out of love. Shrew is not an
unliberated play. Kate's final
speech is not of domestic servility
but of the overpowering force of

love. Although Ms. Olster's view
seemed so inclined, she was
somehow not quite able to pull it
off, which made it difficult to
reconcile the old and the new
Kate.
Costumes were of a uniform
off-white for the entire cast with a
bit of red trim on the main
characters to spice things up. The
simplicity of both costumes and
set enhanced the sense of a
travelling commedia deirarte
troup and, importantly, balanced
the extravagances of slapstick.
The Shakespearean word
stands on its own; the Elizabethan
stage had little or no scenery.
William Ball has chosen to
enhance it with a complementary
style rather than abuse it with the
extravagances of costume and set
which are so often responsible for
the petrification of Shakespeare.
There will inevitably be those
who will scream bloody murder at
Ball's "corruption" of
Shakespeare out of either a lack
of imagination, unfamiliarity with
Ball's implicit reference to
commedia deirarte or both. They
expect Shakespeare to be done in
Elizabethan costume and
"straight," just as it has always
been done.
Indeed, Shakespeare should
never be tampered with
arbitrarily; there should be a
specific purpose for any
innovation of style or
interpretation which is offered.
But the supreme beauty of
Shakespeare's works is that they
lend themselves to such a variety
of interpretations and offer such a
limitless of rewards. A
reactionary approach to his texts
is in blatant contradiction tothe
man's very spirit.
The ultimate test of any
interpretation is whether it
enhances the play or adds some
flash of insight to the work.
Judging from the ebullient
electricity which fills the Geary
Theatre when Shrew is on stage,
one can only conclude: this is the
way Shakespeare is supposed to
be.
