# Ferguson, Poltl To Vikings
## Six Cards Picked In NFL Draft 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Minnesota Vikings chose
James Ferguson and Randy Poltl,
stand-outs in Stanford's
conference-leading defensive
backfield, during the NFL's
collegiate draft which concluded
yesterday.
The Vikings selected Ferguson
in the fifth round and Poltl in the
12th. John Ralston's Broncos
picked John Winesberry as a wide
receiver in the sixth round, while
kicker Rod Garcia was drafted in
the seventh round by the Oakland
Raiders. The Los Angeles Rams
took punter Dave Ottmar in the
16th round.
On Tuesday, the Cincinnati
Bengals had chosen quarterback
Mike Boryla.
Ferguson said last night that he
had "received a telegram from a
specific team in the World
Football League," indicating that
they would select him during one
of the remaining rounds of their
draft. "I'm in a position where I
just have to wait," Ferguson said.
Poltl, who received honorable
mention from the A.P. in its
All-American selections last fall,
could not be reached for
comment last night.

Having spent most of his
Stanford career as a running back,
Winesberry was sidelined early in
the 1973 season with a knee
injury which required surgery. He
said he "was a little surprised that
I got picked by Denver, because it
was just about the only team that
didn't call the trainers to check on
the progress of my recovery."
Winesberry said he had been
contacted yesterday by Ralston,
the Broncos' owner, and a Denver
publicity man. He played on
Ralston's Rose Bowl-winning
team in 1972. Winesberry said
"it's too early to tell" whether he
will sign with the Broncos.
Garcia said he was asleep at the
time the Raiders chose him and
added that when his roommates
told him he had been drafted, "I
thought they were joking." The
San Jose Earthquakes of the
North American Soccer League
drafted Garcia last week and he
may get an oifer from the WFL,
but he said "I imagine I'll go with
Oakland.
Likes Bay Area
"I like the Bay Area quite a bit
and Oakland is a contender,"
Garcia said. The 5-9 kicker holds
the NCAA record for most career

field goals.
Ottmar, who did not know of
his selection until he was
contacted by the Daily, said "I'm
actually kind of surprised" and he
asked whether the Rams had a
decent punter ("I hope they
don't"). "I haven't the faintest
idea what I'll do about their
offer," Ottmar added.
At least three teams' draft
picks seemed somewhat futile.
UCLA's "Blair Pair," James
McAlister and Kermit Johnson,
were drafted by Oakland and San
Francisco, respectively, while
Houston selected USC guard
Booker Brown. All three have
already signed with the San Diego
franchise of the newly founded
WFL.
'Thinking Of Future'
Spokesmen for the Oakland
and Houston clubs refused to
comment on their choices, but
49er official Art Johnson proved
more cooperative. Johnson told
the Associated Press last night
that "we're thinking of the future.
There's an end to a contract. He
[Kermit Johnson | may not like
playing for the WFL," Johnson
said.
"When his contract ends, we'll

have a shot at him. And he may
never play for them. There may
never be a Southern California
team. There may never be a WFL.
Who knows?"
Including McAlister and
Johnson, a total of 11 UCLA
players were drafted in the first
11 rounds. The Rose Bowl
champion USC Trojans had six
men selected during those rounds,
while Stanford had five. During
those 11 rounds, the 26 NFL
dubs selected three Washington
State Cougars, and one player
each from Washington and
Oregon.
The San Diego Chargers
drafted San Diego State
quarterback Jesse Freitas in the
sixth round. Freitas, who led the
nation in passing and total offense
last fall, played behind Jim
Plunkett and Don Bunce here
during the 1970 season before
transferring to San Diego State.

At least three teams' draft
picks seemed somewhat futile.
UCLA's "Blair Pair," James
McAlister and Kermit Johnson,
were drafted by Oakland and San
Francisco, respectively, while
Houston selected USC guard
Booker Brown. All three have
already signed with the San Diego
franchise of the newly founded
WFL.
'Thinking Of Future'
Spokesmen for the Oakland
and Houston clubs refused to
comment on their choices, but
49er official Art Johnson proved
more cooperative. Johnson told
the Associated Press last night
that "we're thinking of the future.
There's an end to a contract. He
[Kermit Johnson | may not like
playing for the WFL," Johnson
said.
"When his contract ends, we'll

have a shot at him. And he may
never play for them. There may
never be a Southern California
team. There may never be a WFL.
Who knows?"
Including McAlister and
Johnson, a total of 11 UCLA
players were drafted in the first
11 rounds. The Rose Bowl
champion USC Trojans had six
men selected during those rounds,
while Stanford had five. During
those 11 rounds, the 26 NFL
dubs selected three Washington
State Cougars, and one player
each from Washington and
Oregon.
The San Diego Chargers
drafted San Diego State
quarterback Jesse Freitas in the
sixth round. Freitas, who led the
nation in passing and total offense
last fall, played behind Jim
Plunkett and Don Bunce here
during the 1970 season before
transferring to San Diego State.
The Minnesota Vikings chose
James Ferguson and Randy Poltl,
stand-outs in Stanford's
conference-leading defensive
backfield, during the NFL's
collegiate draft which concluded
yesterday.
The Vikings selected Ferguson
in the fifth round and Poltl in the
12th. John Ralston's Broncos
picked John Winesberry as a wide
receiver in the sixth round, while
kicker Rod Garcia was drafted in
the seventh round by the Oakland
Raiders. The Los Angeles Rams
took punter Dave Ottmar in the
16th round.
On Tuesday, the Cincinnati
Bengals had chosen quarterback
Mike Boryla.
Ferguson said last night that he
had "received a telegram from a
specific team in the World
Football League," indicating that
they would select him during one
of the remaining rounds of their
draft. "I'm in a position where I

Poltl, who received honorable
mention from the A.P. in its
All-American selections last fall,
could not be reached for
comment last night.

Having spent most of his
Stanford career as a running back,
Winesberry was sidelined early in
the 1973 season with a knee
injury which required surgery. He
said he "was a little surprised that
I got picked by Denver, because it
was just about the only team that
didn't call the trainers to check on
the progress of my recovery."
Winesberry said he had been
contacted yesterday by Ralston,
the Broncos' owner, and a Denver
publicity man. He played on
Ralston's Rose Bowl-winning
team in 1972. Winesberry said
"it's too early to tell" whether he
will sign with the Broncos.
Garcia said he was asleep at the
time the Raiders chose him and
added that when his roommates
told him he had been drafted, "I
thought they were joking." The
San Jose Earthquakes of the
North American Soccer League
drafted Garcia last week and he
may get an oifer from the WFL,
but he said "I imagine I'll go with
Oakland.
