Nixon To Refuse Court Subpoena
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will refuse to testify
personally in the California trial of his former aide, John D.
Ehrlichman, despite a court order won by the defense, the
White House said yesterday.
A Nixon spokesman left open the possibility that the
President might answer written questions in the state court
trial.
Earlier yesterday, Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe
criticized the court order as unrealistic "because the
President of the United States can't appear in every justice
of the peace court all over this country at the whim of that
justice of the peace."
Saxbe told reporters he has ordered a Justice
Department study to determine whether the subpoena sets
a precedent for summoning the President to testify in a
broad range of legal proceedings involving the government.
At the request of Ehrlichman's lawyers, California
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer said Tuesday he will
instruct Nixon to appear as a material witness in the trial of
Ehrlichman and two other defendants in the White House
Plumbers' burglary case.
SF Manhunt: Alioto Asks Public Aid
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto begged a
fearful populace yesterday to cooperate in a widespread
manhunt for the gunmen who murdered four solitary
persons at random Monday night — and possibly six others
last year.
The mayor, who urgently sought gun control laws in
Washington Tuesday, said many motorists and pedestrians
may be stopped and questioned in "Operation Zebra," the
largest manhunt in the city's history.
"Literally every police unit is involved in the
investigation of the slayings and the protection of the
public," said Alioto as police sought at least two men
described by witnesses as clean-cut young blacks.
"I would like people to be understanding of some police
efforts, such as halting people on the streets and requiring
identification. I assure them they will be treated with
courtesy, their rights will be protected and police officers

However, the Southwest presents a problem, because
water for irrigation purposes is not readily available. The
best farmsites are typically 1500 miles from water supplies.
To solve this problem would require vast expenditures
and careful planning at state and federal levels.
Another important factor in determining the feasibility
of this method is the quantity of plant tissue that can be
produced in an area in a certain time period. To satisfy the
country's current gas needs, 2.2 billion tons of dry plant
material would be required.
Optimum Vegetation
After examining numerous species of vegetation,
including algae and eucalyptus, the researchers found
sugarcane and sunflower to be "prime candidates" for mass
tissue production.
The advantages of sugarcane are its high yields and its
ability to produce successive crops without replanting.
Characteristics that make the sunflower a likely choice
include its rapid growth, wide adaptability, drought
tolerance, short growing season, massive vegetative
production and adaptability to root harvesting.
Henry said that more than one kind of plant could be
used to make optimum use of the field. He added that the
researchers are trying to develop a new type of plant that
would grow faster.
Economic Feasibility
The study closely examined costs to determine whether
this method of producing energy could be competitive with
oil or coal.
Farming costs include those of land, production,
irrigation and harvesting. These have been estimated, based
on various studies, but haven't yet been directly applied.
One encouraging aspect of the study is that the energy
produced would be clean enough to meet tough federal
anti-pollution standards. In fact, Henry pointed out that
the process would produce "essentially no waste."
Research was initiated last May and should be completed
by March of this year. Areas that still need to be studied
include an evaluation of energy input versus energy yield,
land availability and suitability, and fuel characteristics of
plant tissue.

will act within Constitutional limits," Alioto said.
Police urged that no one walk alone at night in this city
of 750,000 where some frightened residents are keeping
indoors or walking about in groups for protection.
Revitalized Energy Measure Sought
WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders of Congress
yesterday looked for ways to revive the emergency energy
bill and give President Nixon powers he requested to deal
with the energy crisis.
The Senate voted Tuesday to send the bill back to
conference with the House in an effort to remove a
controversial provision designed to limit oil industry
profits.
Asked yesterday if the conferees would reconvene,
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said, "I think so,
but what they'll do in conference, I don't know."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., said Tuesday that
without the bill the President would have to declare a
national emergency before he could order gasoline
rationing.
The administration had indicated it would make the
current voluntary 10-gallon limit on gasoline sales
mandatory as soon as the bill became law. It has also said it
needs the bill before it can suspend certain environmental
requirements to permit the burning of dirtier fuels.
Judge Dismisses Hughes Indictment
RENO, Nev. — Charges of stock fraud against billionaire
Howard Hughes in the purchase of a regional airline were
dismissed yesterday by a federal judge who called the
indictment one of the worst he had ever seen.
U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Thompson dropped all
nine counts in the federal grand jury indictment against
Hughes and four other men.
In Washington, the Justice Department immediately said
it would seek another indictment against the five persons as
soon as possible.
The indictment related to charges that Hughes and
others conspired to drive down the stock of Airwest, a
Western feeder airline, and then pressured directors to sell
to Hughes, who subsequently bought the airline and
renamed it Hughes Airwest.
Gas Situation Grows Worse
Many service stations were running out of gas yesterday
as their monthly allocations fell short of demand, and
customers faced long lines and limited sales in stations that
had gas.
Station operators said the situation this month was
worse than last because: January allotments were smaller
than those for December; many stations preserved gas in
December because of holiday closings; and the first day of
February is a Friday, meaning many stations won't get next
month's allotment until the following Monday.
In addition, some stations which haven't used all of their
January allotment have not been able to get the rest
because the oil companies tell them it's too expensive to
ship in partial loads.
Some station operators say they're expecting substantial
cuts in February allotments.
Oil Firms Report Large Earnings
SAN FRANCISCO — Standard Oil Co. of California, one
of four partners in the giant Aramco Mideast petroleum
combine, yesterday reported 1973 earnings of $843.6
million — a 54 percent gain over 1972. Fourth quarter 1973
earnings jumped 94 percent.
Standard of California was the last of the
Arabian-American Oil Co. partners in Saudi Arabia oil
production to report 1973 earnings.
Exxon previously reported a 59 percent earnings gain for
1973, Mobil 47 percent and Texaco 45 percent. The
average net income gain for the four petroleum giants was
50 percent.
Board Chairman O.N. Miller ascribed Standard's 1973
gains primarily to increased sales and to the recovery of oil
prices abroad from low levels of 1972.
"In no way do they support statements that profits are
excessive," he said.

The study closely examined costs to determine whether
this method of producing energy could be competitive with
oil or coal.
Farming costs include those of land, production,
irrigation and harvesting. These have been estimated, based
on various studies, but haven't yet been directly applied.
One encouraging aspect of the study is that the energy
produced would be clean enough to meet tough federal
anti-pollution standards. In fact, Henry pointed out that
the process would produce "essentially no waste."
Research was initiated last May and should be completed
by March of this year. Areas that still need to be studied
include an evaluation of energy input versus energy yield,
land availability and suitability, and fuel characteristics of
plant tissue.

Police urged that no one walk alone at night in this city
of 750,000 where some frightened residents are keeping
indoors or walking about in groups for protection.
Revitalized Energy Measure Sought
WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders of Congress
yesterday looked for ways to revive the emergency energy
bill and give President Nixon powers he requested to deal
with the energy crisis.
The Senate voted Tuesday to send the bill back to
conference with the House in an effort to remove a
controversial provision designed to limit oil industry
profits.
Asked yesterday if the conferees would reconvene,
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said, "I think so,
but what they'll do in conference, I don't know."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., said Tuesday that
without the bill the President would have to declare a
national emergency before he could order gasoline
rationing.
The administration had indicated it would make the
current voluntary 10-gallon limit on gasoline sales
mandatory as soon as the bill became law. It has also said it
needs the bill before it can suspend certain environmental
requirements to permit the burning of dirtier fuels.
Judge Dismisses Hughes Indictment
RENO, Nev. — Charges of stock fraud against billionaire
Howard Hughes in the purchase of a regional airline were
dismissed yesterday by a federal judge who called the
indictment one of the worst he had ever seen.
U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Thompson dropped all
nine counts in the federal grand jury indictment against
Hughes and four other men.
In Washington, the Justice Department immediately said
it would seek another indictment against the five persons as
soon as possible.
The indictment related to charges that Hughes and
others conspired to drive down the stock of Airwest, a
Western feeder airline, and then pressured directors to sell
to Hughes, who subsequently bought the airline and
renamed it Hughes Airwest.
Gas Situation Grows Worse
Many service stations were running out of gas yesterday
as their monthly allocations fell short of demand, and
customers faced long lines and limited sales in stations that
had gas.
Station operators said the situation this month was
worse than last because: January allotments were smaller
than those for December; many stations preserved gas in
December because of holiday closings; and the first day of
February is a Friday, meaning many stations won't get next
month's allotment until the following Monday.
In addition, some stations which haven't used all of their
January allotment have not been able to get the rest
because the oil companies tell them it's too expensive to
ship in partial loads.
Some station operators say they're expecting substantial
cuts in February allotments.
Oil Firms Report Large Earnings
SAN FRANCISCO — Standard Oil Co. of California, one
of four partners in the giant Aramco Mideast petroleum
combine, yesterday reported 1973 earnings of $843.6
million — a 54 percent gain over 1972. Fourth quarter 1973
earnings jumped 94 percent.
Standard of California was the last of the
Arabian-American Oil Co. partners in Saudi Arabia oil
production to report 1973 earnings.
Exxon previously reported a 59 percent earnings gain for
1973, Mobil 47 percent and Texaco 45 percent. The
average net income gain for the four petroleum giants was
50 percent.
Board Chairman O.N. Miller ascribed Standard's 1973
gains primarily to increased sales and to the recovery of oil
prices abroad from low levels of 1972.
"In no way do they support statements that profits are
excessive," he said.

Nixon To Refuse Court Subpoena
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will refuse to testify
personally in the California trial of his former aide, John D.
Ehrlichman, despite a court order won by the defense, the
White House said yesterday.
A Nixon spokesman left open the possibility that the
President might answer written questions in the state court
trial.
Earlier yesterday, Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe
criticized the court order as unrealistic "because the
President of the United States can't appear in every justice
of the peace court all over this country at the whim of that
justice of the peace."
Saxbe told reporters he has ordered a Justice
Department study to determine whether the subpoena sets
a precedent for summoning the President to testify in a
broad range of legal proceedings involving the government.
At the request of Ehrlichman's lawyers, California
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer said Tuesday he will
instruct Nixon to appear as a material witness in the trial of
Ehrlichman and two other defendants in the White House
Plumbers' burglary case.
SF Manhunt: Alioto Asks Public Aid
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto begged a
fearful populace yesterday to cooperate in a widespread
manhunt for the gunmen who murdered four solitary
persons at random Monday night — and possibly six others
last year.
The mayor, who urgently sought gun control laws in
Washington Tuesday, said many motorists and pedestrians
may be stopped and questioned in "Operation Zebra," the
largest manhunt in the city's history.
"Literally every police unit is involved in the
investigation of the slayings and the protection of the
public," said Alioto as police sought at least two men
described by witnesses as clean-cut young blacks.
"I would like people to be understanding of some police
efforts, such as halting people on the streets and requiring
identification. I assure them they will be treated with
courtesy, their rights will be protected and police officers

However, the Southwest presents a problem, because
water for irrigation purposes is not readily available. The
best farmsites are typically 1500 miles from water supplies.
To solve this problem would require vast expenditures
and careful planning at state and federal levels.
Another important factor in determining the feasibility
of this method is the quantity of plant tissue that can be
produced in an area in a certain time period. To satisfy the
country's current gas needs, 2.2 billion tons of dry plant
material would be required.
Optimum Vegetation
After examining numerous species of vegetation,
including algae and eucalyptus, the researchers found
sugarcane and sunflower to be "prime candidates" for mass
tissue production.
The advantages of sugarcane are its high yields and its
ability to produce successive crops without replanting.
Characteristics that make the sunflower a likely choice
include its rapid growth, wide adaptability, drought
tolerance, short growing season, massive vegetative
production and adaptability to root harvesting.
Henry said that more than one kind of plant could be
used to make optimum use of the field. He added that the
researchers are trying to develop a new type of plant that
would grow faster.

In addition, some stations which haven't used all of their
January allotment have not been able to get the rest
because the oil companies tell them it's too expensive to

Some station operators say they're expecting substantial

Oil Firms Report Large Earnings
SAN FRANCISCO — Standard Oil Co. of California, one
of four partners in the giant Aramco Mideast petroleum
combine, yesterday reported 1973 earnings of $843.6
million — a 54 percent gain over 1972. Fourth quarter 1973
earnings jumped 94 percent.
Standard of California was the last of the
Arabian-American Oil Co. partners in Saudi Arabia oil
production to report 1973 earnings.
Exxon previously reported a 59 percent earnings gain for
1973, Mobil 47 percent and Texaco 45 percent. The
average net income gain for the four petroleum giants was
50 percent.
Board Chairman O.N. Miller ascribed Standard's 1973
gains primarily to increased sales and to the recovery of oil
prices abroad from low levels of 1972.
"In no way do they support statements that profits are
excessive," he said.
Today's Weather
Rain likely today turning to showers tonight. Clearing
tomorrow but with chance of showers in the morning.
Highs both days in 50s. Chance of rain 70 percent today
and 80 percent tonight.
Nixon To Refuse Court Subpoena
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will refuse to testify
personally in the California trial of his former aide, John D.
Ehrlichman, despite a court order won by the defense, the
White House said yesterday.
A Nixon spokesman left open the possibility that the
President might answer written questions in the state court
trial.
Earlier yesterday, Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe
criticized the court order as unrealistic "because the
President of the United States can't appear in every justice
of the peace court all over this country at the whim of that
justice of the peace."
Saxbe told reporters he has ordered a Justice
Department study to determine whether the subpoena sets
a precedent for summoning the President to testify in a
broad range of legal proceedings involving the government.
At the request of Ehrlichman's lawyers, California
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer said Tuesday he will
instruct Nixon to appear as a material witness in the trial of
Ehrlichman and two other defendants in the White House
Plumbers' burglary case.
SF Manhunt: Alioto Asks Public Aid
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto begged a
fearful populace yesterday to cooperate in a widespread
manhunt for the gunmen who murdered four solitary
persons at random Monday night — and possibly six others
last year.
The mayor, who urgently sought gun control laws in
Washington Tuesday, said many motorists and pedestrians
may be stopped and questioned in "Operation Zebra," the
largest manhunt in the city's history.
"Literally every police unit is involved in the
investigation of the slayings and the protection of the
public," said Alioto as police sought at least two men
described by witnesses as clean-cut young blacks.
"I would like people to be understanding of some police
efforts, such as halting people on the streets and requiring
identification. I assure them they will be treated with
courtesy, their rights will be protected and police officers
Plants Provide Energy

However, the Southwest presents a problem, because
water for irrigation purposes is not readily available. The
best farmsites are typically 1500 miles from water supplies.
To solve this problem would require vast expenditures
and careful planning at state and federal levels.
Another important factor in determining the feasibility
of this method is the quantity of plant tissue that can be
produced in an area in a certain time period. To satisfy the
country's current gas needs, 2.2 billion tons of dry plant
material would be required.
Optimum Vegetation
After examining numerous species of vegetation,
including algae and eucalyptus, the researchers found
sugarcane and sunflower to be "prime candidates" for mass
tissue production.
The advantages of sugarcane are its high yields and its
ability to produce successive crops without replanting.
Characteristics that make the sunflower a likely choice
include its rapid growth, wide adaptability, drought
tolerance, short growing season, massive vegetative
production and adaptability to root harvesting.
Henry said that more than one kind of plant could be
used to make optimum use of the field. He added that the
researchers are trying to develop a new type of plant that
would grow faster.
Economic Feasibility
The study closely examined costs to determine whether
this method of producing energy could be competitive with
oil or coal.
Farming costs include those of land, production,
irrigation and harvesting. These have been estimated, based
on various studies, but haven't yet been directly applied.
One encouraging aspect of the study is that the energy
produced would be clean enough to meet tough federal
anti-pollution standards. In fact, Henry pointed out that
the process would produce "essentially no waste."
Research was initiated last May and should be completed
by March of this year. Areas that still need to be studied
include an evaluation of energy input versus energy yield,
land availability and suitability, and fuel characteristics of
plant tissue.

Police urged that no one walk alone at night in this city
of 750,000 where some frightened residents are keeping
indoors or walking about in groups for protection.
Revitalized Energy Measure Sought
WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders of Congress
yesterday looked for ways to revive the emergency energy
bill and give President Nixon powers he requested to deal
with the energy crisis.
The Senate voted Tuesday to send the bill back to
conference with the House in an effort to remove a
controversial provision designed to limit oil industry
profits.
Asked yesterday if the conferees would reconvene,
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said, "I think so,
but what they'll do in conference, I don't know."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., said Tuesday that
without the bill the President would have to declare a
national emergency before he could order gasoline
rationing.
The administration had indicated it would make the
current voluntary 10-gallon limit on gasoline sales
mandatory as soon as the bill became law. It has also said it
needs the bill before it can suspend certain environmental
requirements to permit the burning of dirtier fuels.
Judge Dismisses Hughes Indictment
RENO, Nev. — Charges of stock fraud against billionaire
Howard Hughes in the purchase of a regional airline were
dismissed yesterday by a federal judge who called the
indictment one of the worst he had ever seen.
U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Thompson dropped all
nine counts in the federal grand jury indictment against
Hughes and four other men.
In Washington, the Justice Department immediately said
it would seek another indictment against the five persons as
soon as possible.
The indictment related to charges that Hughes and
others conspired to drive down the stock of Airwest, a
Western feeder airline, and then pressured directors to sell
to Hughes, who subsequently bought the airline and
renamed it Hughes Airwest.
Gas Situation Grows Worse
Many service stations were running out of gas yesterday
as their monthly allocations fell short of demand, and
customers faced long lines and limited sales in stations that
had gas.
Station operators said the situation this month was
worse than last because: January allotments were smaller
than those for December; many stations preserved gas in
December because of holiday closings; and the first day of
February is a Friday, meaning many stations won't get next
month's allotment until the following Monday.
In addition, some stations which haven't used all of their

investigation of the slayings and the protection of the
public," said Alioto as police sought at least two men
described by witnesses as clean-cut young blacks.
"I would like people to be understanding of some police
efforts, such as halting people on the streets and requiring
identification. I assure them they will be treated with
courtesy, their rights will be protected and police officers
Plants Provide Energy

However, the Southwest presents a problem, because
water for irrigation purposes is not readily available. The
best farmsites are typically 1500 miles from water supplies.
To solve this problem would require vast expenditures
and careful planning at state and federal levels.
Another important factor in determining the feasibility
of this method is the quantity of plant tissue that can be
produced in an area in a certain time period. To satisfy the
country's current gas needs, 2.2 billion tons of dry plant
material would be required.
Optimum Vegetation
After examining numerous species of vegetation,
including algae and eucalyptus, the researchers found
sugarcane and sunflower to be "prime candidates" for mass
tissue production.
The advantages of sugarcane are its high yields and its
ability to produce successive crops without replanting.
Characteristics that make the sunflower a likely choice
include its rapid growth, wide adaptability, drought
tolerance, short growing season, massive vegetative
production and adaptability to root harvesting.
Henry said that more than one kind of plant could be
used to make optimum use of the field. He added that the
researchers are trying to develop a new type of plant that
would grow faster.
Economic Feasibility
The study closely examined costs to determine whether
this method of producing energy could be competitive with
oil or coal.
Farming costs include those of land, production,
irrigation and harvesting. These have been estimated, based
on various studies, but haven't yet been directly applied.
One encouraging aspect of the study is that the energy
produced would be clean enough to meet tough federal
anti-pollution standards. In fact, Henry pointed out that
the process would produce "essentially no waste."
Research was initiated last May and should be completed
by March of this year. Areas that still need to be studied
include an evaluation of energy input versus energy yield,
land availability and suitability, and fuel characteristics of
plant tissue.

will act within Constitutional limits," Alioto said.
Police urged that no one walk alone at night in this city
of 750,000 where some frightened residents are keeping
indoors or walking about in groups for protection.
Revitalized Energy Measure Sought
WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders of Congress
yesterday looked for ways to revive the emergency energy
bill and give President Nixon powers he requested to deal
with the energy crisis.
The Senate voted Tuesday to send the bill back to
conference with the House in an effort to remove a
controversial provision designed to limit oil industry
profits.
Asked yesterday if the conferees would reconvene,
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said, "I think so,
but what they'll do in conference, I don't know."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., said Tuesday that
without the bill the President would have to declare a
national emergency before he could order gasoline
rationing.
The administration had indicated it would make the
current voluntary 10-gallon limit on gasoline sales
mandatory as soon as the bill became law. It has also said it
needs the bill before it can suspend certain environmental
requirements to permit the burning of dirtier fuels.
Judge Dismisses Hughes Indictment
RENO, Nev. — Charges of stock fraud against billionaire
Howard Hughes in the purchase of a regional airline were
dismissed yesterday by a federal judge who called the
indictment one of the worst he had ever seen.
U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Thompson dropped all
nine counts in the federal grand jury indictment against
Hughes and four other men.
In Washington, the Justice Department immediately said
it would seek another indictment against the five persons as
soon as possible.
The indictment related to charges that Hughes and
others conspired to drive down the stock of Airwest, a
Western feeder airline, and then pressured directors to sell
to Hughes, who subsequently bought the airline and
renamed it Hughes Airwest.
Gas Situation Grows Worse
Many service stations were running out of gas yesterday
as their monthly allocations fell short of demand, and
customers faced long lines and limited sales in stations that
had gas.
Station operators said the situation this month was
worse than last because: January allotments were smaller
than those for December; many stations preserved gas in
December because of holiday closings; and the first day of
February is a Friday, meaning many stations won't get next
month's allotment until the following Monday.
In addition, some stations which haven't used all of their
January allotment have not been able to get the rest
because the oil companies tell them it's too expensive to
ship in partial loads.
Some station operators say they're expecting substantial
cuts in February allotments.
Oil Firms Report Large Earnings
SAN FRANCISCO — Standard Oil Co. of California, one
of four partners in the giant Aramco Mideast petroleum
combine, yesterday reported 1973 earnings of $843.6
million — a 54 percent gain over 1972. Fourth quarter 1973
earnings jumped 94 percent.
Standard of California was the last of the
Arabian-American Oil Co. partners in Saudi Arabia oil
production to report 1973 earnings.
Exxon previously reported a 59 percent earnings gain for
1973, Mobil 47 percent and Texaco 45 percent. The
average net income gain for the four petroleum giants was
50 percent.
Board Chairman O.N. Miller ascribed Standard's 1973
gains primarily to increased sales and to the recovery of oil
prices abroad from low levels of 1972.
"In no way do they support statements that profits are
excessive," he said.
Today's Weather
Rain likely today turning to showers tonight. Clearing
tomorrow but with chance of showers in the morning.
Highs both days in 50s. Chance of rain 70 percent today
and 80 percent tonight.
Nixon To Refuse Court Subpoena
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will refuse to testify
personally in the California trial of his former aide, John D.
Ehrlichman, despite a court order won by the defense, the
White House said yesterday.
A Nixon spokesman left open the possibility that the
President might answer written questions in the state court
trial.
Earlier yesterday, Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe
criticized the court order as unrealistic "because the
President of the United States can't appear in every justice
of the peace court all over this country at the whim of that
justice of the peace."
Saxbe told reporters he has ordered a Justice
Department study to determine whether the subpoena sets
a precedent for summoning the President to testify in a
broad range of legal proceedings involving the government.
At the request of Ehrlichman's lawyers, California
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer said Tuesday he will
instruct Nixon to appear as a material witness in the trial of
Ehrlichman and two other defendants in the White House
Plumbers' burglary case.
SF Manhunt: Alioto Asks Public Aid
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto begged a
fearful populace yesterday to cooperate in a widespread
manhunt for the gunmen who murdered four solitary
persons at random Monday night — and possibly six others
last year.
The mayor, who urgently sought gun control laws in
Washington Tuesday, said many motorists and pedestrians
may be stopped and questioned in "Operation Zebra," the
largest manhunt in the city's history.
"Literally every police unit is involved in the
investigation of the slayings and the protection of the
public," said Alioto as police sought at least two men
described by witnesses as clean-cut young blacks.
"I would like people to be understanding of some police
efforts, such as halting people on the streets and requiring
