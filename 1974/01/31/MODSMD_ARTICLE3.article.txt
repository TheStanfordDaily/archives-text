# Youth Airline Fares Gradually Disappear
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Airline youth fares — once as much
a part of college life as ma, apple pie
and the UCLA basketball team — will
be eliminated on June 1, 1974.
The phase-out is not the result of
the present fuel shortage, according to
Susan Maher of the Sequoia Travel
Service. Youth fares, along with other
discount rates, were declared
discriminatory and the phase-out was
initiated before the present fuel
situation developed.
Originally, youth fare was 50
percent of the regular price of an
economy class ticket, Maher said, but
the rates have increased gradually to
the present level: 92 percent of
economy fare. Stand-by fares are 83
percent of a normal price.
Maher added that because youth
fares are a percentage of the full fare,
they will rise proportionately when
airlines raise their rates to meet rising
fuel prices. Regular fares rose five
percent last Dec. 1, and a similar
increase is expected in March, she said.
As a result, students may be
looking for less expensive travel
alternatives when they go home during
spring break, if they go home at all.
Charter Flights Cheapest
ASSU charter flights still seem to
be the best bet to Chicago and New
York, at $139 and $159 respectively.
Maher quotes regular economy fare to
Chicago at $264, youth fare at $242,
and stand-by at $234.
With the present reduction in
flights, however, stand-by is becoming
risky. Airlines are doubling up flights
to fill more seats, which means less
chance of calcellation and perhaps a
long wait at the airport, Maher said.
Terry Hess of the ASSU Travel
Service reports that it is having trouble
obtaining planes for charter flights
because airlines are cutting back and
eliminating many flights.
Hess predicts a dramatic increase in
charter prices; the cost of the spring
flight to Hawaii has already jumped 10
percent, and airline officials have
reserved the right to pass along any
fuel price increases to the charter
service, he added.
More Charters Planned
However, Hess says that the service
is trying to increase the number of
charter flights in the future, since
there was a 50 percent increase in
people flying charter over Christmas.
Hess mentioned that ASSU is trying
to arrange another flight to New York,
one back from New York next
September, and a flight to Washington.
"We hope to continue as long as there
is demand from students and faculty,"
he said.
As an alternative to flying, traveling
by train or bus is not as practical as
one might think. According to an
Amtrak ticket information clerk,
railroad fare to Chicago is $90 with 2Mr
days traveling time. Bus fare to
Chicago is $74 and also requires 2V6

days of travel, according to a Palo Alto
Greyhound bus representative. Neither
figure includes the cost of meals and
loss of sleep.
The Amtrak clerk reported that
train fares will increase 20 percent in
June as a result of the fuel shortage.
The Greyhound representative said it
has not been affected by the fuel
situation.
All in all, Stanford students and
faculty, as well as travelers across the
country, may find their travel more
expensive and more crowded.
The National Student Lobby
reported in a press release that it is
trying to persuade the House of
Representatives to hold hearings on
reinstatement of discount rates.
But, as it stands now, youth fare
ends June 1, and it's about a four
week ride to Chicago on a bicycle.
