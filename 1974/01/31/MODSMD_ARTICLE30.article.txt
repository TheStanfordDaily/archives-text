# PA Council Ponders Cable TV

### MARY PICKETT 
One morning over his cup of
breakfast coffee, college junior Stan
Landlee checks his bank balance,
orders a shirt from a shopping center
five miles away and reads two chapters
in a book from an across-campus
library — all by only flipping on his
television set. Science fiction? It may
not be if the Palo Alto City Council
adopts a recent citizens report on
cable television (CATV).
That report, officially presented to
the Council's Finance and Public
Works Committee last week,
recommends the establishment of a $5
million, city-owned CATV system.
Originated in the 1940s as a means
to boost commercial television signals
to distant regions, CATV has
expanded into other areas including
"cable casting" — locally originated
programming.
With up to 60 channels available,
Palo Alto's proposed system would
carry eight to 11 Bay Area television
stations and four UHF educational
stations. In addition to over-the-air
television, the local CATV would
broadcast programs originating in Palo
Alto.
According to the report, a CATV
system could draw on the city's
cultural scene for program
possibilities. Dance performances,
theater, art shows, lectures, concerts
and sports events could all be sources
for local programs.
In compliance with FCC
regulations, local cable television
would also offer cost-free public
access, educational and government
channels. A public access channel
would provide citizens with a way of
speaking out on local problems and a
government channel would cover
public meetings.
Because the report also
recommends that from the beginning
the system have a two-way capacity
enabling the viewer to "talk back" to
the station, educational channels could
bring classes from the local school
system to shut-ins.
Asked about CATV systems which
have failed to attract enough
subscribers, Thomas O. Passell,
chairman of the CATV Citizens'
Committee, said Palo Alto's cable
television should aim for quality.
Passell pointed out that the
committee also recommended the City

Council appropriate $50,000 to study
financing, engineering design and
programming.
Steven P. Young, another member
of the committee, said he saw the
proposed system providing services
rather than innovative programming.
"Sunnyvale has almost gone broke
trying to develop a creative program
system," Young said.
Young, the author of a minority
report, challenged the committee's
recommendation that the system be
city-owned rather than franchised to a
private company.
A Sloan Foundation study directed

by Edwin B. Parker, a professor of
communication, has recommended
cable television for the Stanford
campus if it can be funded by outside
sources.
Parker, also a member of the
citizens' committee, said that the
campus system would not overlap the
city's CATV and Stanford could hook
up with Palo Alto's set-up.
Although the City Council's
Finance and Public Works Committee
did not act on the CATV
recommendations last week, it will
bring them up again at its Feb. 26
meeting.
