# Skydivers Train Eight Hours-And Jump
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Jumping out of an airplane may
seem like a drastic way to escape from
studying, but some Stanford students
have done exactly that.
Sport parachuting or skydiving is
taught in eight hours at special group
rates by Stevens Para-loft of Oakland
and Falcon Parachute School of San
Jose. At least 80 Stanford students
have trained at Stevens.
Tim Scott of ATO house organized
a group of 30 who learned to jump at
Stevens last year. Scott describes the
fining as "very marine-like" and

"disciplinarian."
"They really put a lot of pressure
on you to know what you're doing,"
says Scott, adding that the instructors
give the students the impression that
"you aren't there just to have a good
time."
All-Day Training
Students train all day Saturday at
the Stevens facility in Oakland
learning to jump away from a plane,
count out a free fall, pull a rip cord,
detangle lines, deploy reserve chutes in
emergencies and land without injury.

Jeff Child of Terra House describes
the Saturday training as, "Drill, drill,
drill, drill, drill."
Mark Kamlet, another member of
Scott's party, says of the training, "It
wasn't all that grueling, but it was
more grueling than I thought it would
be."
James K. "Doc" Stoll, one of less
than 100 certified sport parachute
instructor-examiners in the country,
manages the Antioch Sport Parachute
Center where Stevens trainees make
their Sunday jump. Stoll believes that
much of the training students receive
on how to steer their chutes is "a
complete, utter, total waste."
"I'm willing to bet they don't
remember two percent of what we tell
them," Stoll remarks.
Easy For Athletes
Stoll says that skydiving is
relatively easy to teach to people who
have experience in skiing, football,
tumbling or karate because persons in
these sports must know how to fall.
Swimming, diving, or scuba diving help
a person learn in-the-air maneuvers.
"If you get a guy who doesn't
swim, has never been involved in any
sport, and has never had any contact
with the elements except to protect
himself from them, you've got
trouble," Stoll warns.
During the training students are
suspended from a harness which allows
them to experience how a tangled
parachute shakes a diver. Stoll times
students to see whether they can
untangle the chute in the 18 seconds it
takes to hit the ground from 3000
feet.
Stoll also takes the opportunity to
relieve the boredom of the long
training session.
"You're on your second bounce,"
Stoll tells the suspended student.
"Then I tell them what someone looks
like who's come in from 3000 feet. If

they're bored, that usually gets their
attention."
Fear doesn't grip most students
until they are in the plane and ready
to jump.
"You're up in a little plane, and
there are clouds around, and you
realize you're going to walk out the
door," says Kamlet.
"You can almost count the things
your life hinges on," comments Child.
"One of them is your implicit trust in
the guy behind you who attaches you
to the static line."
Although all students are taught to
pull the rip cord, the first five jumps a
diver makes are done with a static line
which pulls the cord automatically
when the student leaves the plane.
Prayerful Moment
Child describes the moment his
chute opened. "WHOOSH! I looked
up and it was there. It was there, so
then I thanked everybody," he says
with a glance towards the heavens.
Child states that after his
three-minute fall, his landing was
"harder than I was led to believe from
jumping off a three foot platform."
Stoll emphasizes that parachuting is
not as dangerous as most people think
— if a jumper is trained properly. Still,
it is the lure of danger which draws
most people to jump.
Try Only Once
"Most people just want to be able
to say they've done it," Stoll explains,
adding that many want to prove to
themselves that they can jump.
"It's frightening to think of doing it
over and over again," says Kamlet,
explaining why he never expects to
jump again.
Of those who train at Stevens, only
one-and-a-half percent jump more than
once, but those who have jumped that
once agree — it is what Kamlet calls
"one of the more exciting
experiences."

weak to free herself from the harness, might have broken more than typing
fingers in a real jump.
