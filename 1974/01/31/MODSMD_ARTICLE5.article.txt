# Solutions Suggested For Terrace Traffic
## 
### BILL ROSS 
A variety of solutions for reducing
traffic in College Terrace were
proposed last night at an open forum
at Lucille Nixon School.
Speakers suggested everything from
keeping the area completely open to
erecting more blockades to isolate the
region in order to reduce traffic. The
meeting was attended by more than 80
area residents.
The forum was designed to give
members of the Stanford-Palo Alto
Liaison Committee an opportunity to
hear the opinions of local citizens.
After being confronted by numerous
plans to reduce traffic in College
Terrace, the Palo Alto City Council
had asked the Liaison Committee to
study the matter and formulate a
recommendation.
But the Council must make the
final decision in the matter. Although
bordered on three sides by Stanford,
College Terrace is a part of Palo Alto.
The Liaison Committee, formed last
year to discuss issues of mutual
concern to the University and the
City, serves only an advisory capacity
to the two entities.
"There is entirely too much traffic
in College Terrace," Colin Mick, a
resident of the Terrace stated. "There
are 2400 cars a day on my block,
which should only accommodate 500
cars on it each day. The traffic
continues until midnight. The noise is
almost completely unbearable."
Mick asserted that some sort of
barrier is necessary if traffic is to be

reduced.
But James Peterson, a Terrace
resident and Stanford student, insisted
that the noise wasn't particularly
disturbing.
"It seems stupid to put up barriers
that people are going to ignore," he
said. Peterson stated that the main
problem confronting residents isn't
traffic volume but rather the speed of
cars. He suggested that Palo Alto put
up more stoplights.
Many speakers complained about
the barriers that the City erected last
September.

transportation," John Murphy, a
Terrace resident noted.
Some Terrace residents praised the
barriers, contending that they have
reduced traffic, making the
neighborhood more quiet and safer for
children.
A few residents expressed fear that
the increased traffic, if allowed to
continue at its current volume, will
lead to a deterioration of property
values in the Terrace.
One plan suggested at the meeting
called for the elimination of all
barriers with the concomitant
widening of Stanford Avenue on the
side not bordered by houses.
The matter will be discussed next
month at a meeting of the
Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committee.
