# Plants Seen As Possible Fuel Source

Grow your own fuel supply?
As unlikely a solution to the energy
shortage as this sounds, Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) is working on
a government-funded study that
indicates such an approach could be
the most efficient method of tapping
solar energy.
The energy that reaches the earth
from the sun every year is equal to the
energy that would be released by
burning 120 trillion tons of coal,
about 25 times the world's estimated
reserves.
Besides offering an inexhaustible
supply, solar energy is cleaner than
any other energy source being used.
But two problems have
continuously plagued scientists who
have attempted to convert solar energy
to a usable fuel. The sun's radiation is
diffuse, necessitating a method of
condensing the energy into an area
that it could be useful. The second
obstacle is supplying power when the
sun isn't shirting.
Plants Store Energy
The method being studied at SRI
circumvents these problems by using
natural vegetation as a catalyst for
trapping and storing the sun's energy.
The process of capturing solar
radiation and converting it to fuel is
quite simple. Common plants are
grown, solar dried, finely shredded and
then converted to synthetic gas or
burned in an electric power plant
instead of coal.
Feasibility of such a plan on a
large-scale basis depends greatly on
overall economic and energy
conservation factors. Dr. John P.
Henry Jr., director of SRl's Energy
Technology Department, said it
appears the cost will be competitive
with fuels derived from imported
crude oil or coal.
Dr. Robert E. Inman, manager of
SRl's Plant Biology Department,
stated that the cost per ton of dry
plant material is estimated at $9.40,
while $8 buys a ton of coal. He said
that "it's encouraging that the prices
are so close." Inman has been doing
most of the research of the highly
detailed study.
Because the primary factor
controlling plant growth is light, the
area of the country which has the
highest incident solar radiation
rppresents the ideal location. Study
found these places to be "in the
Southwest, whene the arid, desert, or
semidesert climate precludes extensive
cloud cover."
make sure it is something we want to
experiment with."
Deans, department heads and
campaign project representatives
submit fund-raising requests to the
provost's office. There, requests are
divided into three general areas for
review by the provost's staff.
"Most proposals pass here," Massey
explains. But one in every four
requests receives further review by the
provost's staff for development.
Approved proposals are listed in the
"Campaign for Stanford Gift
Opportunities" folder.
Each fund request listed in the
folder receives a priority rating.
Among the "urgent" priorities are
requests for "unlimited" amounts of
graduate and undergraduate student
aid and endowed professorships. More
specific requests are listed as
"priority," "limited priority" or
"standard priority."
"Only 10-15 percent of the
requests have a specific donor in
mind," Massey explains. "We
encourage people to think through
their project without the pressure of a
ready donor."
Matching the interests of potential
donors with the priorities of the
University is the concern of Campaign
for Stanford fund-raisers.
Assoc. General Secretary Dwain
Fullerton, director of corporate
relations, says he shows potential
donors "the book that lists the things
we need money for."
Fullerton points out that
corporations receive more than 100
requests for contributions each month.
They appreciate Stanford's specific
approach because it allows them to
make philathropic decisions according
to "a rationale for giving," he explains.
Former trustee David Packard, one
of Stanford's largest benefactors says
University fund-seekers "are more
likely to get money if they find a
special interest."
Frank Koch, public affairs director
for Syntex Corporation, says his firm
"gives in a variety of ways, usually for
a specific project or program." But he
emphasizes that the purpose of the gift
is determined by the beneficiary, not
the corporation.
However, Stanford's two most
urgent needs — general unrestricted
money and funds for the new main
library — aren't even listed in the Gift
Opportunities folder. "People in the
GSO just know that it's
'super-urgent,' " Massey explains.
But other than a $15 million

matching pledge for library funds that
kicked off the Campaign for Stanford,
Campaign information director Dave
Fulton couldn't recall "a single other
substantial committment in that area
to date." And Massey observes that "it
is so hard to raise money for
renovation of quad buildings that we
may have to bite the bullet and do it
ourselves."
Fullerton says that the University
Progress Fund and the Research
Development Fund are "hard to raise
money for." These funds are the major
source of support for innovative but
incremental programs.
Occasionally, says Massey, a donor
will volunteer funds for a non-priority
program. "What happens then depends
on whether it meets our criteria. If he
really wants to do it, we don't stand
on ceremony."
Thus, "donors have influence on
what the University will take for
restricted giving," Massey says, "but
not a controlling influence."
However, he adds that "some
departments don't get the same kind
of donor interest as others." For that
reason, the University budgeteers must
reallocate unrestricted funds to
departments who lack a wealthy donor
continuency.
"We used to get a substantial
amount from the general fund," says
Geology Prof. William R. Evitt. "When
things got tight, support from the
University general fund was cut off
because geology has a number of
endowed funds."
Devaney explains that unrestricted
funds are reallocated only when they
have been replaced by a restricted
contribution. But Massey points out
that it is "hard to equalize without
being unfair to the.donors. It's hard to
trace exactly what happens," he says.
"The University literally lives on
gifts," warns one fund-raising
pamphlet. That condition is not likely
to change in the near future. ( "But
hopefully, we can look back and say
we raised the money for the things we
wanted to," Massey says.
