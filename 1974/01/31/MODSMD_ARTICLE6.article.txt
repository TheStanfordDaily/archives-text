# Plants Seen As Possible Fuel Source

Grow your own fuel supply?
As unlikely a solution to the energy
shortage as this sounds, Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) is working on
a government-funded study that
indicates such an approach could be
the most efficient method of tapping
solar energy.
The energy that reaches the earth
from the sun every year is equal to the
energy that would be released by
burning 120 trillion tons of coal,
about 25 times the world's estimated
reserves.
Besides offering an inexhaustible
supply, solar energy is cleaner than
any other energy source being used.
But two problems have
continuously plagued scientists who
have attempted to convert solar energy
to a usable fuel. The sun's radiation is
diffuse, necessitating a method of
condensing the energy into an area
that it could be useful. The second
obstacle is supplying power when the
sun isn't shirting.
Plants Store Energy
The method being studied at SRI
circumvents these problems by using
natural vegetation as a catalyst for
trapping and storing the sun's energy.
The process of capturing solar
radiation and converting it to fuel is
quite simple. Common plants are
grown, solar dried, finely shredded and
then converted to synthetic gas or
burned in an electric power plant
instead of coal.
Feasibility of such a plan on a
large-scale basis depends greatly on
overall economic and energy
conservation factors. Dr. John P.
Henry Jr., director of SRl's Energy
Technology Department, said it
appears the cost will be competitive
with fuels derived from imported
crude oil or coal.
Dr. Robert E. Inman, manager of
SRl's Plant Biology Department,
stated that the cost per ton of dry
plant material is estimated at $9.40,
while $8 buys a ton of coal. He said
that "it's encouraging that the prices
are so close." Inman has been doing
most of the research of the highly
detailed study.
Because the primary factor
controlling plant growth is light, the
area of the country which has the
highest incident solar radiation
rppresents the ideal location. Study
found these places to be "in the
Southwest, whene the arid, desert, or
semidesert climate precludes extensive
cloud cover."
