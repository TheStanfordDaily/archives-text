Lovas' Diatribe
Editor:
The letter by John Lovas (Daily,
Jan. 24) was a needed rebuttal to the
recent column by Larry Diamond
advocating the reinstatement of the
ROTC program at Stanford. Like Mr.
Lovas, I found Mr. Diamond's
arguments in favor of reinstatement to
be far less than compelling.
It is unfortunate, however, that Mr.
Lovas could not resist the temptation
to cast aspersions on the motivations
underlying Mr. Diamond's position.
The suggestion that Mr. Diamond's
current position on the ROTC issue
represents an accomodation to
political "reasonableness," and the
implication that such "accomodating
'reasonableness'" is precursory to
straddling the "nearest political
fence," are groundless and unnecessary
bases on which to build a case in
opposition to the reinstatement of
ROTC.
Indeed, I found Mr. Lovas' resort to
personal invective to be indicative not
of an interest in establishing legitimate
bases from which to hang an argument
in opposition to ROTC, but, rather,
indicative of an interest in establishing
bases from which to hang Mr.
Diamond. As such, Mr. Lovas'
contribution to the ROTC controversy
represents a useless diatribe of a kind
which the controversy can do without.

Vietnamese Violence
Editor:
The Saigon government has been
systematically violating the Paris Peace
Accords, with massive United States
support. It is clear that the Thieu
regime cannot maintain its hold on the
Vietnamese people if the articles of
the peace agreement are carried out.
This bitter theme was brought
home last Saturday by several speakers
recently returned from Vietnam. The
occasion was a Vietnam Solidarity
Program entitled "Peace With Honor:
One Year Later," sponsored by a
coalition of Bay Area peace
organizations.
Ngo Thanh Nhan, a member of the
Union of Vietnamese in the United
States, addressed the audience during
the evening session. In his native
tongue he wished us a happy new year.
This is the occasion of Tet, the
beginning of the new year of the
Vietnamese calendar. It is an occasion
frought with meaning. In Vietnam,
Ngo said, Tet is Considered
everybody's birthday: everyone is a
year older by experience. Also, it is a
time to commemorate the people's
ancestors, to become aware of their
tradition and to renew the
responsibility to maintain that
tradition.
For us, the significance of this New
Year in Vietnam is great. This is a time
to call ourselves one year older, with
one more year of experience: an
experience of deceit and double-talk
by our government. It is a time to
recall the efforts of those who in the
past decade gave their whole souls to
the struggle to halt our government's
destruction of the land and people of
Vietnam. And now, my friends, this
New Year is the time to renew our
responsibility to fight with all our
strength against the continuing
violence directed at the Vietnamese
people by our government and the
Thieu regime.

Knoke's Analysis Shallow
Editor:
Bill Knoke offers three basic
reasons in arguing for the
reinstatement of ROTC: academic
diversity, scholarships for middle
income students, and less killing or
better leadership in future wars.
Programs already exist for increasing
academic diversity at Stanford. Mr.
Knoke chose a bad example in saying
"you can't learn to speak Swedish at
Stanford," for in fact you can. A
number of students who wanted to
learn Swedish got together with the

Linguistics Department which
provided a teacher for them. The same
could be accomplished for a class in
celestial navigation (or most any other
subject) through SCIRE or
Undergraduate Special Programs if
anyone has enough interest to organize
the class.
Providing scholarships for middle
income students — those too poor to
finance their own education but too
rich for financial aids — is a somewhat
better argument. (We shall ignore the
fact that the Uniersity claims such
middle income students are not being
excluded.) However Mr. Knoke
reduces this argument to only two
alternatives — either ROTC supplies
scholarships for these students, or they
don't come to Stanford.
As best I can determine, in the late
60's the ROTC program provided
about 30-55 scholarships for each
incoming class. Even assuming all these
students were the middle income types
who could not come to Stanford
otherwise, it is not that big a number.
And what is to be done with those
middle income persons who, like many
of us, have no great desire for military
service? Are we to force them into the
army as a criterion for coming to
Stanford? Better, I would think, to
concentrate on finding other means
for making scholarships or loans
available to middle income students.
For those who desire both a
Stanford education and military
service, I would suggest joining the
army first, and afterwards financing a
Stanford education on veteran's
benefits.
Finally, Mr. Knoke says he would
rather have intelligent Stanford ROTC
graduates leading our troops then
"brutalizing death technology
machines." It would seem to me that
Stanford ROTC graduates would more
likely be running or designing these
brutalizing machines than leading
ground troops. While more intelligent
(Stanford ROTC graduate,
presumably) leadership might prevent
"blind napalming of square miles of
land," it is not at all clear to me that
this leadership would prevent the use
of napalm or anything else in
America's new technological arsenal.
Thus we find that the "advantages"
of ROTC are either already available at
Stanford or better provided by other
sources. The key question — the
incompatibility of ROTC in a
university setting — has still not been
answered.

Reaction to Ottilie
Editor:
I am answering from the gut,
risking the full swing of
Yippie-anarcho-infantilist tendencies.
But Monday's column by Mr. Ottilie
was a crock full. He parrots the
administration in a specious argument
for the "mandate of the people"
which, it appears, is impossible to
retract. A mandate which cannot be
rescinded does damage to the notion
of popular sovereignty (ALL Power to
the people, eh Mr. Ottilie?). Implied in
Nixon's concept and Ottilie's
yea-saying is an emasculation of the
legislative branch of the federal
government. Which mandate? Which
people?
I have to say I was amused until I
read of a vital interconnection
between botched imperialism (Bay of
Pigs) and American inner city
insurrections. Then Ottilie groups the
great ideologue of the American Right,
George Lincoln Rockwell, with Martin
Luther King. Isn't Ottilie's whole
point dat de black people of America
can thank the Great White father in
Washington for a piece of de pie? I
don't suppose Chicanos have yet
impressed Ottillie's consciousness or
he'd have had us doing a corrida in
thanks to the President.
Enough. What poses for an
argument in Ottilie's article rings like a
hymn, and I just can't carry the tune.

Programs already exist for increasing
academic diversity at Stanford. Mr.
Knoke chose a bad example in saying
"you can't learn to speak Swedish at
Stanford," for in fact you can. A
number of students who wanted to
learn Swedish got together with the

Linguistics Department which
provided a teacher for them. The same
could be accomplished for a class in
celestial navigation (or most any other
subject) through SCIRE or
Undergraduate Special Programs if
anyone has enough interest to organize
the class.
Providing scholarships for middle
income students — those too poor to
finance their own education but too
rich for financial aids — is a somewhat
better argument. (We shall ignore the
fact that the Uniersity claims such
middle income students are not being
excluded.) However Mr. Knoke
reduces this argument to only two
alternatives — either ROTC supplies
scholarships for these students, or they
don't come to Stanford.
As best I can determine, in the late
60's the ROTC program provided
about 30-55 scholarships for each
incoming class. Even assuming all these
students were the middle income types
who could not come to Stanford
otherwise, it is not that big a number.
And what is to be done with those
middle income persons who, like many
of us, have no great desire for military
service? Are we to force them into the
army as a criterion for coming to
Stanford? Better, I would think, to
concentrate on finding other means
for making scholarships or loans
available to middle income students.
For those who desire both a
Stanford education and military
service, I would suggest joining the
army first, and afterwards financing a
Stanford education on veteran's
benefits.
Finally, Mr. Knoke says he would
rather have intelligent Stanford ROTC
graduates leading our troops then
"brutalizing death technology
machines." It would seem to me that
Stanford ROTC graduates would more
likely be running or designing these
brutalizing machines than leading
ground troops. While more intelligent
(Stanford ROTC graduate,
presumably) leadership might prevent
"blind napalming of square miles of
land," it is not at all clear to me that
this leadership would prevent the use
of napalm or anything else in
America's new technological arsenal.
Thus we find that the "advantages"
of ROTC are either already available at
Stanford or better provided by other
sources. The key question — the
incompatibility of ROTC in a
university setting — has still not been
answered.

I am answering from the gut,

Yippie-anarcho-infantilist tendencies.
But Monday's column by Mr. Ottilie
was a crock full. He parrots the
administration in a specious argument
for the "mandate of the people"
which, it appears, is impossible to
retract. A mandate which cannot be
rescinded does damage to the notion
of popular sovereignty (ALL Power to
the people, eh Mr. Ottilie?). Implied in
Nixon's concept and Ottilie's
yea-saying is an emasculation of the
legislative branch of the federal
government. Which mandate? Which
people?
I have to say I was amused until I
read of a vital interconnection
between botched imperialism (Bay of
Pigs) and American inner city
insurrections. Then Ottilie groups the
great ideologue of the American Right,
George Lincoln Rockwell, with Martin
Luther King. Isn't Ottilie's whole
point dat de black people of America
can thank the Great White father in
Washington for a piece of de pie? I
don't suppose Chicanos have yet
impressed Ottillie's consciousness or
he'd have had us doing a corrida in

Enough. What poses for an

Lovas' Diatribe
Editor:
The letter by John Lovas (Daily,
Jan. 24) was a needed rebuttal to the
recent column by Larry Diamond
advocating the reinstatement of the
ROTC program at Stanford. Like Mr.
Lovas, I found Mr. Diamond's
arguments in favor of reinstatement to
be far less than compelling.
It is unfortunate, however, that Mr.
Lovas could not resist the temptation
to cast aspersions on the motivations
underlying Mr. Diamond's position.
The suggestion that Mr. Diamond's
current position on the ROTC issue
represents an accomodation to
political "reasonableness," and the
implication that such "accomodating
'reasonableness'" is precursory to
straddling the "nearest political
fence," are groundless and unnecessary
bases on which to build a case in
opposition to the reinstatement of
ROTC.
Indeed, I found Mr. Lovas' resort to
personal invective to be indicative not
of an interest in establishing legitimate
bases from which to hang an argument
in opposition to ROTC, but, rather,
indicative of an interest in establishing
bases from which to hang Mr.
Diamond. As such, Mr. Lovas'
contribution to the ROTC controversy
represents a useless diatribe of a kind
which the controversy can do without.

Vietnamese Violence
Editor:
The Saigon government has been
systematically violating the Paris Peace
Accords, with massive United States
support. It is clear that the Thieu
regime cannot maintain its hold on the
Vietnamese people if the articles of
the peace agreement are carried out.
This bitter theme was brought
home last Saturday by several speakers
recently returned from Vietnam. The
occasion was a Vietnam Solidarity
Program entitled "Peace With Honor:
One Year Later," sponsored by a
coalition of Bay Area peace
organizations.
Ngo Thanh Nhan, a member of the
Union of Vietnamese in the United
States, addressed the audience during
the evening session. In his native
tongue he wished us a happy new year.
This is the occasion of Tet, the
beginning of the new year of the
Vietnamese calendar. It is an occasion
frought with meaning. In Vietnam,
Ngo said, Tet is Considered
everybody's birthday: everyone is a
year older by experience. Also, it is a
time to commemorate the people's
ancestors, to become aware of their
tradition and to renew the
responsibility to maintain that
tradition.
For us, the significance of this New
Year in Vietnam is great. This is a time
to call ourselves one year older, with
one more year of experience: an
experience of deceit and double-talk
by our government. It is a time to
recall the efforts of those who in the
past decade gave their whole souls to
the struggle to halt our government's
destruction of the land and people of
Vietnam. And now, my friends, this
New Year is the time to renew our
responsibility to fight with all our
strength against the continuing
violence directed at the Vietnamese
people by our government and the
Thieu regime.

Lovas' Diatribe
Editor:
The letter by John Lovas (Daily,
Jan. 24) was a needed rebuttal to the
recent column by Larry Diamond
advocating the reinstatement of the
ROTC program at Stanford. Like Mr.
Lovas, I found Mr. Diamond's
arguments in favor of reinstatement to
be far less than compelling.
It is unfortunate, however, that Mr.
Lovas could not resist the temptation
to cast aspersions on the motivations
underlying Mr. Diamond's position.
The suggestion that Mr. Diamond's
current position on the ROTC issue
represents an accomodation to
political "reasonableness," and the
implication that such "accomodating
'reasonableness'" is precursory to
straddling the "nearest political
fence," are groundless and unnecessary
bases on which to build a case in
opposition to the reinstatement of
ROTC.
Indeed, I found Mr. Lovas' resort to
personal invective to be indicative not
of an interest in establishing legitimate
bases from which to hang an argument
in opposition to ROTC, but, rather,
indicative of an interest in establishing
bases from which to hang Mr.
Diamond. As such, Mr. Lovas'
contribution to the ROTC controversy
represents a useless diatribe of a kind
which the controversy can do without.

Vietnamese Violence
Editor:
The Saigon government has been
systematically violating the Paris Peace
Accords, with massive United States
support. It is clear that the Thieu
regime cannot maintain its hold on the
Vietnamese people if the articles of
the peace agreement are carried out.
This bitter theme was brought
home last Saturday by several speakers
recently returned from Vietnam. The
occasion was a Vietnam Solidarity
Program entitled "Peace With Honor:
One Year Later," sponsored by a
coalition of Bay Area peace
organizations.
Ngo Thanh Nhan, a member of the
Union of Vietnamese in the United
States, addressed the audience during
the evening session. In his native
tongue he wished us a happy new year.
This is the occasion of Tet, the
beginning of the new year of the
Vietnamese calendar. It is an occasion
frought with meaning. In Vietnam,
Ngo said, Tet is Considered
everybody's birthday: everyone is a
year older by experience. Also, it is a
time to commemorate the people's
ancestors, to become aware of their
tradition and to renew the
responsibility to maintain that
tradition.
For us, the significance of this New
Year in Vietnam is great. This is a time
to call ourselves one year older, with
one more year of experience: an
experience of deceit and double-talk
by our government. It is a time to
recall the efforts of those who in the
past decade gave their whole souls to
the struggle to halt our government's
destruction of the land and people of
Vietnam. And now, my friends, this
New Year is the time to renew our
responsibility to fight with all our
strength against the continuing
violence directed at the Vietnamese
people by our government and the
Thieu regime.

Knoke's Analysis Shallow
Editor:
Bill Knoke offers three basic
reasons in arguing for the
reinstatement of ROTC: academic
diversity, scholarships for middle
income students, and less killing or
better leadership in future wars.
Programs already exist for increasing
academic diversity at Stanford. Mr.
Knoke chose a bad example in saying
"you can't learn to speak Swedish at
Stanford," for in fact you can. A
number of students who wanted to
learn Swedish got together with the

Linguistics Department which
provided a teacher for them. The same
could be accomplished for a class in
celestial navigation (or most any other
subject) through SCIRE or
Undergraduate Special Programs if
anyone has enough interest to organize
the class.
Providing scholarships for middle
income students — those too poor to
finance their own education but too
rich for financial aids — is a somewhat
better argument. (We shall ignore the
fact that the Uniersity claims such
middle income students are not being
excluded.) However Mr. Knoke
reduces this argument to only two
alternatives — either ROTC supplies
scholarships for these students, or they
don't come to Stanford.
As best I can determine, in the late
60's the ROTC program provided
about 30-55 scholarships for each
incoming class. Even assuming all these
students were the middle income types
who could not come to Stanford
otherwise, it is not that big a number.
And what is to be done with those
middle income persons who, like many
of us, have no great desire for military
service? Are we to force them into the
army as a criterion for coming to
Stanford? Better, I would think, to
concentrate on finding other means
for making scholarships or loans
available to middle income students.
For those who desire both a
Stanford education and military
service, I would suggest joining the
army first, and afterwards financing a
Stanford education on veteran's
benefits.
Finally, Mr. Knoke says he would
rather have intelligent Stanford ROTC
graduates leading our troops then
"brutalizing death technology
machines." It would seem to me that
Stanford ROTC graduates would more
likely be running or designing these
brutalizing machines than leading
ground troops. While more intelligent
(Stanford ROTC graduate,
presumably) leadership might prevent
"blind napalming of square miles of
land," it is not at all clear to me that
this leadership would prevent the use
of napalm or anything else in
America's new technological arsenal.
Thus we find that the "advantages"
of ROTC are either already available at
Stanford or better provided by other
sources. The key question — the
incompatibility of ROTC in a
university setting — has still not been
answered.

by our government. It is a time to
recall the efforts of those who in the
past decade gave their whole souls to
the struggle to halt our government's
destruction of the land and people of
Vietnam. And now, my friends, this
New Year is the time to renew our
responsibility to fight with all our
strength against the continuing
violence directed at the Vietnamese
people by our government and the
Thieu regime.

Knoke's Analysis Shallow
Editor:
Bill Knoke offers three basic
reasons in arguing for the
reinstatement of ROTC: academic
diversity, scholarships for middle
income students, and less killing or
better leadership in future wars.
Programs already exist for increasing
academic diversity at Stanford. Mr.
Knoke chose a bad example in saying
"you can't learn to speak Swedish at
Stanford," for in fact you can. A
number of students who wanted to
learn Swedish got together with the

Linguistics Department which
provided a teacher for them. The same
could be accomplished for a class in
celestial navigation (or most any other
subject) through SCIRE or
Undergraduate Special Programs if
anyone has enough interest to organize
the class.
Providing scholarships for middle
income students — those too poor to
finance their own education but too
rich for financial aids — is a somewhat
better argument. (We shall ignore the
fact that the Uniersity claims such
middle income students are not being
excluded.) However Mr. Knoke
reduces this argument to only two
alternatives — either ROTC supplies
scholarships for these students, or they
don't come to Stanford.
As best I can determine, in the late
60's the ROTC program provided
about 30-55 scholarships for each
incoming class. Even assuming all these
students were the middle income types
who could not come to Stanford
otherwise, it is not that big a number.
And what is to be done with those
middle income persons who, like many
of us, have no great desire for military
service? Are we to force them into the
army as a criterion for coming to
Stanford? Better, I would think, to
concentrate on finding other means
for making scholarships or loans
available to middle income students.
For those who desire both a
Stanford education and military
service, I would suggest joining the
army first, and afterwards financing a
Stanford education on veteran's
benefits.
Finally, Mr. Knoke says he would
rather have intelligent Stanford ROTC
graduates leading our troops then
"brutalizing death technology
machines." It would seem to me that
Stanford ROTC graduates would more
likely be running or designing these
brutalizing machines than leading
ground troops. While more intelligent
(Stanford ROTC graduate,
presumably) leadership might prevent
"blind napalming of square miles of
land," it is not at all clear to me that
this leadership would prevent the use
of napalm or anything else in
America's new technological arsenal.
Thus we find that the "advantages"
of ROTC are either already available at
Stanford or better provided by other
sources. The key question — the
incompatibility of ROTC in a
university setting — has still not been
answered.

Reaction to Ottilie
Editor:
I am answering from the gut,
risking the full swing of
Yippie-anarcho-infantilist tendencies.
But Monday's column by Mr. Ottilie
was a crock full. He parrots the
administration in a specious argument
for the "mandate of the people"
which, it appears, is impossible to
retract. A mandate which cannot be
rescinded does damage to the notion
of popular sovereignty (ALL Power to
the people, eh Mr. Ottilie?). Implied in
Nixon's concept and Ottilie's
yea-saying is an emasculation of the
legislative branch of the federal
government. Which mandate? Which
people?
I have to say I was amused until I
read of a vital interconnection
between botched imperialism (Bay of
Pigs) and American inner city
insurrections. Then Ottilie groups the
great ideologue of the American Right,
George Lincoln Rockwell, with Martin
Luther King. Isn't Ottilie's whole
point dat de black people of America
can thank the Great White father in
Washington for a piece of de pie? I
don't suppose Chicanos have yet
impressed Ottillie's consciousness or
he'd have had us doing a corrida in
thanks to the President.
Enough. What poses for an
argument in Ottilie's article rings like a
hymn, and I just can't carry the tune.

Lovas' Diatribe
Editor:
The letter by John Lovas (Daily,
Jan. 24) was a needed rebuttal to the
recent column by Larry Diamond
advocating the reinstatement of the
ROTC program at Stanford. Like Mr.
Lovas, I found Mr. Diamond's
arguments in favor of reinstatement to
be far less than compelling.
It is unfortunate, however, that Mr.
Lovas could not resist the temptation
to cast aspersions on the motivations
underlying Mr. Diamond's position.
The suggestion that Mr. Diamond's
current position on the ROTC issue
represents an accomodation to
political "reasonableness," and the
implication that such "accomodating
'reasonableness'" is precursory to
straddling the "nearest political
fence," are groundless and unnecessary
bases on which to build a case in
opposition to the reinstatement of
ROTC.
Indeed, I found Mr. Lovas' resort to
personal invective to be indicative not
of an interest in establishing legitimate
bases from which to hang an argument
in opposition to ROTC, but, rather,
indicative of an interest in establishing
bases from which to hang Mr.
Diamond. As such, Mr. Lovas'
contribution to the ROTC controversy
represents a useless diatribe of a kind
which the controversy can do without.

Vietnamese Violence
Editor:
The Saigon government has been
systematically violating the Paris Peace
Accords, with massive United States
support. It is clear that the Thieu
regime cannot maintain its hold on the
Vietnamese people if the articles of
the peace agreement are carried out.
This bitter theme was brought
home last Saturday by several speakers
recently returned from Vietnam. The
occasion was a Vietnam Solidarity
Program entitled "Peace With Honor:
One Year Later," sponsored by a
coalition of Bay Area peace
organizations.
Ngo Thanh Nhan, a member of the
Union of Vietnamese in the United
States, addressed the audience during
the evening session. In his native
tongue he wished us a happy new year.
This is the occasion of Tet, the
beginning of the new year of the
Vietnamese calendar. It is an occasion
frought with meaning. In Vietnam,
Ngo said, Tet is Considered
everybody's birthday: everyone is a
year older by experience. Also, it is a
time to commemorate the people's
ancestors, to become aware of their
tradition and to renew the
responsibility to maintain that
tradition.
For us, the significance of this New
Year in Vietnam is great. This is a time
to call ourselves one year older, with
one more year of experience: an
experience of deceit and double-talk
by our government. It is a time to
recall the efforts of those who in the
past decade gave their whole souls to
the struggle to halt our government's
destruction of the land and people of
Vietnam. And now, my friends, this
New Year is the time to renew our
responsibility to fight with all our
strength against the continuing
violence directed at the Vietnamese
people by our government and the
Thieu regime.
