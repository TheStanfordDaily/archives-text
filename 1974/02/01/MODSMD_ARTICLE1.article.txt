# Emeritus Faculty Complex On Row
## Officials Defend Apartment Plan 
### DENIS CUFF 
"I do confess we have not done a
good job of communicating with
[Row] residents," Robert R.
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, admitted last night at an
open meeting concerning the proposed
emeritus faculty apartment complex
slated for construction on the Row.
But, said Augsburger, "we did not
make a mistake in selecting the site."
Augsburger, Edward Shaw, assistant
to Provost William F. Miller, and
Faculty-Staff Housing Manager Robert
Summers were questioned —
sometimes sharply — by students at
one of the best-attended ASSU Senate
meetings in recent memory.
The officials were pessimistic about
the possibility of halting the 100-unit
project; however, they conceded that
the University made a mistake in not
seeking more student reaction before
reaching a decision.
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend
said he did not think the University
made the best site selection.
Statistical Evidence
Friend said that he expected the
University representatives to present
statistical evidence that would "shoot
down" his arguments against the
proposed project, but they didn't.
Friend questioned how any
100-unit complex, complete with
parking and recreational facilities,
would not ruin the appearance of the
Row.
Assoc. History Prof. Gavin
Langmuir, a resident of Salvatierra
Street directly across from the
proposed site also raised doubts about
the achitecture.
Project Rewarding
"I'm not sure the project is so
rewarding I would like to move into
it," he said.
Summers replied that he was
confident that builders could produce
architecture "sympathetic" to the
older houses in the Row, but added
that specific details about architecture

couldn't be known without consulting
the builders.
Summers said the same architects
who designed most of Escondido
Village will design the new housing
complex.
Approval of the architectural plans
will be the last step before plans are
finalized and construction begins,
according to Shaw.
Row To Be Saved
Shaw assured students that the
University has no intentions of tearing
down the Row houses. The University
is committed to retaining the houses as
long as students want to live in them,
he said.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady,
along with several others, raised
questions about the compatability of

emeriti faculty living in an area
directly adjacent to student housing.
Specifically, he questioned a site rating
chart prepared by the Planning Office
which gave the site the highest
compatibility rating.
Summers replied that specific
numbers on the scale were a
"subjective matter," but he said he
was confident the old Stanford
Elementary School (S.E.S.) site was
the best one.
Considerations
There are economic, social and
other considerations, Summers
explained. Other undeveloped sites
will run higher costs if they need new
sewers and other utilities, Summers
added.
Summers said there had been no

comparative cost analysis, but added
that by "eyeing the most strongly
considered alternative sites," he was
sure they would cost more.
Summers emphasized the
importance of placing the housing
complex in close proximity to the
central part of the campus.
Several students questioned
Summers on this matter citing an ad
hoc University committee report
which stated that of the faculty and
staff who responded, there was no
clear preference for a "close in" or
"far out" location.
Summers said that since this
nport's 1972 publication, student
demonstrations and violence on
campus has decreased tremendously.

older houses in the Row, but added
that specific details about architecture

couldn't be known without consulting
the builders.
Summers said the same architects
who designed most of Escondido
Village will design the new housing
complex.
Approval of the architectural plans
will be the last step before plans are
finalized and construction begins,
according to Shaw.
Row To Be Saved
Shaw assured students that the
University has no intentions of tearing
down the Row houses. The University
is committed to retaining the houses as
long as students want to live in them,
he said.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady,
along with several others, raised
questions about the compatability of

emeriti faculty living in an area
directly adjacent to student housing.
Specifically, he questioned a site rating
chart prepared by the Planning Office
which gave the site the highest
compatibility rating.
Summers replied that specific
numbers on the scale were a
"subjective matter," but he said he
was confident the old Stanford
Elementary School (S.E.S.) site was
the best one.
Considerations
There are economic, social and
other considerations, Summers
explained. Other undeveloped sites
will run higher costs if they need new
sewers and other utilities, Summers
added.
Summers said there had been no

comparative cost analysis, but added
that by "eyeing the most strongly
considered alternative sites," he was
sure they would cost more.
Summers emphasized the
importance of placing the housing
complex in close proximity to the
central part of the campus.
Several students questioned
Summers on this matter citing an ad
hoc University committee report
which stated that of the faculty and
staff who responded, there was no
clear preference for a "close in" or
"far out" location.
Summers said that since this
nport's 1972 publication, student
demonstrations and violence on
campus has decreased tremendously.

BETTER COMMUNICATION — Appearing before a special meeting of the ASSU Senate last night, University Vice
President for Business and Finance Robert R. Augsburger (right) admitted that "we have not done a good job of
communicating with [Row] residents" about the University's plans for development in the area. Senate Chairman Reggie
Turner listens.
"I do confess we have not done a
good job of communicating with
[Row] residents," Robert R.
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, admitted last night at an
open meeting concerning the proposed
emeritus faculty apartment complex
slated for construction on the Row.
But, said Augsburger, "we did not
make a mistake in selecting the site."
Augsburger, Edward Shaw, assistant
to Provost William F. Miller, and
Faculty-Staff Housing Manager Robert
Summers were questioned —
sometimes sharply — by students at
one of the best-attended ASSU Senate
meetings in recent memory.
The officials were pessimistic about
the possibility of halting the 100-unit
project; however, they conceded that
the University made a mistake in not
seeking more student reaction before
reaching a decision.
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend
said he did not think the University
made the best site selection.
Statistical Evidence
Friend said that he expected the
University representatives to present
statistical evidence that would "shoot
down" his arguments against the
proposed project, but they didn't.
Friend questioned how any
100-unit complex, complete with
parking and recreational facilities,
would not ruin the appearance of the
Row.
Assoc. History Prof. Gavin
Langmuir, a resident of Salvatierra
Street directly across from the
proposed site also raised doubts about
the achitecture.
Project Rewarding
"I'm not sure the project is so
rewarding I would like to move into
it," he said.
Summers replied that he was
confident that builders could produce
architecture "sympathetic" to the
older houses in the Row, but added
that specific details about architecture

couldn't be known without consulting
the builders.

Village will design the new housing
