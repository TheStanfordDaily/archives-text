# Academic Or Financial Considerations?
## Stanford Land Use Responsibilities 
### 
Jim Francesconi

Over the past few months, People Planning for
Stanford, a coalition of citizens groups from the
Midpeninsula, has held a series of meetings with the
Stanford P'anning Staff concerning the future of the
Stanford Shopping Center. During these meetings
Dave Wright, Sarah Johnston, Ellen Carnegie, John
Philo, Gordon Lewin, Brooke Kantor, and Jim
Francesconi presented to Mr. Augsburger and his
staff an alternative development plan by People
Planning for Stanford for the Stanford Shopping
Center (which is available at the Land for People
office).
It has now become apparent that the usefulness of
those meetings has terminated due to basic
philosophical disagreements between the University
and the citizens' committee about how the land in
the shopping center vicinity can best be utilized for
both the immediate and future good of the largest
number of people.
Despite recent fanfare emanath'fg from the
University regarding its new land use policy which
emphasizes academic rather than financial future
land uses, the truth of the matter is that the
University is still very much interested in the
commercial expansion of the shopping center at
such time when the atmosphere is politically ripe.
Loophole To Policy
The loophole in the draft statement of the new
land use policy that will permit this expansion is the
phrase, "Commercial, retail or service uses shall be
limited to those areas already developed for such
purposes or to such locations as may be required to
serve the needs of the University and its residents."
Despite initial concerns expressed by University
officials in the meetings with People Planning for
Stanford over issues such as the effects of large
shopping centers on surrounding communities and
the effects of the gas shortage on shopping centers
in the future, the question of how to make the
shopping center more commercially attractive and
diversified clearly had highest priority. University
planners expressed hopes for securing a large men's
clothing store as well as several garden shops for the
shopping center. This is in opposition to People
Planning for Stanford's recommendations for the
shopping center which call for no commercial
development of the shopping center until the

University has taken concrete steps in that area to
meet some of its social responsibilities.
The discussions between the University officials
and the citizens group concerning the shopping
center lands focused upon the issue which most
clearly separates the two sides — housing. Stanford's
new proposed Land Use Policy states: "Housing .. .
shall give priority of occupancy to students, faculty,
and staff; and, whenever feasible, shall be located
and designed to permit use for student and/or
faculty/staff housing if recaptured by the
University."
Although such a policy may slightly improve the
housing situation in Palo Alto by removing some
students from the housing market, it completely
ignores the root of the problem which has been past
University land use policies.
University Shirks Responsibility
People Planning for Stanford commends
Stanford's apparent decision not to view its land
primarily as a financial resource thus avoiding many
of the social ills that inevitably follow. But at the
same time we regret an "enlightened" university's
inability to accept responsibility for past decisions
and failure to attempt to mould a more creative
future for the Midpeninsula.
According to Stanford's own Moulton
Committee housing report, "The University has
helped to produce the area's shortage of low rent
housing both because of the housing needs of its
students, faculty and staff, and because its land
development programs . . . have significantly
increased demand for local housing." The report,
issued in 1970, estimated the unsatisfied demand
for low-income units alone in the Palo
Alto-Stanford Area at about 4,000 and judged that
about 70 percent of this shortage was directly
attributable to University operations of the
development of Stanford lands.
Stanford University, as the largest landholder in
the Midpeninsula and as the greatest contributing
factor to the industrialization of the area in the
1950s and 60s, has a responsibility to allow some of
its land to be used to ease the tremendous housing
shortage which plagues this area — and that means
allowing housing to be built for the workers in the
Stanford Industrial Park. Until workers are allowed

to live near their work, they will be forced to
pay increasing communting costs just
as the rest of us are forced to bear the social ill
effects of more freeways, more cars, and more
pollution.
Land Must Be Available
People Planning for Stanford is not suggesting
that Stanford University be made to bear the total
cost of financing future low/moderate income
housing developments. The city of Palo Alto which
receives tax revenues from the shopping center and
industries on Stanford land should bear a large share
of the cost. But the point that needs to be
emphasized is that land on which to build the
housing must be available before discussions of
financing can begin.
Statements such as the "use of presently
undeveloped lands by organizations or for purposes
which do not have a strong bond with the research
and teaching function is deemed contrary to the
long-term interests of the University and the larger
society it serves," indicate the narrow-minded
approach some University officials bring both to the
function of the educatory process and the problems
of the larger society.
Forty acres on the Willow Road site, out of the
thousands at the University's disposal, used for low
and moderate income housing for students, staff
and workers in Stanford's Industrial Park, wouldn't
threaten the academic functions of the University.
But it will indicate that the University is becoming
aware of its social responsibilities to its surrounding
community and is beginning to take active steps to
meet it.
Put into a larger context it will signify that
Stanford Unviersity is becoming aware that the real
test of an "enlightened" university rests not solely
with purely "academic" or "technological"
contributions to a large but removed society, but
also with practical, realistic steps taken to build
better communities on local and regional levels.
That which is strangling American life in the 1970s
will not be remedied by the acadeinia or
technology, but by the bringing together of
fragmented individual lives which inevitably must
begin in local communities.
