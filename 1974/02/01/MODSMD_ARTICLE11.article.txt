College Terrace Traffic
Editor:
Several writers have asked what the
College Terrace traffic problem is all
about, and understandably so. In any
discussion of that subject, it is
important to separate out the real
issues from the false ones.
First, a problem does exist. College
Terrace is a peninsula between an
industrial park and a major university
(the park being a joint city-university
venture). We all knew that when we
moved here, or should not have
expected taxable lands to remain open
forever for our convenience.
Cross-traffic therefore does exist, just
as it does in many other residential
areas of the city. That problem can be
handled by way of barricades, as
suggested by Councilman Henderson
on January 14.
Then there is the peripheral traffic
along Stanford and California
Avenues. Through traffic on Stanford
can be reduced by reasonable
deterrents (stop signs, traffic lights,
etc.), and the Industrial Park traffic on
California surely can be alleviated in
some way.
The most serious stumbling block,
however, is the vindictive attitude that
some College Terrace
"representatives" hold toward
Stanford, and their opposition to the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace

housing project. One of them in
particular, Mr. James Culpepper,
president of the College Terrace
Neighborhood Association, has
advanced what he called "a modest
plan" to block off Stanford Avenue
entirely at Bowdoin Street, diverting
all traffic onto the campus. That plan,
or a modified version that would
divert most traffic to Stanford, is
clearly unfair and unnecessary, and the
Universi y has been understandably
reluctant to go along with it.
In Mr. Culpepper's mind, that
means that Stanford "doesn't give a
damn about College Terrace," as he
told the Stanford Daily on January 28.
Such a "continued attitude of
..on-cooperation," he added
significantly, will impede the
annexation of Frenchman's Terrace to
Palo Alto. In other words, if Stanford
does not accede to his demands for an
interchange at Stanford and Bowdoin,
that is sufficient reason for Palo Alto
to reject the housing project. Heads or
tails, Mr. Culpepper wins.
The College Terrace traffic problem
can be solved if all parties act in a
responsible manner. It cannot be if
one of them uses the issue as an outlet
for his own feelings or as a means of
halting a housing project that he has
steadfastly resisted for several years.

Frat 'Childish Behavior'
Editor:
We at Zeta Psi fraternity were
dismayed to learn that members of
another major Stanford fraternity
were involved, last week, in a public
display of nudity and other childish
behavior in Meyer Library.
We have striven to foster liberated
male-female relationships over the past
several years in hopes that we could
escape the time-worn rubric of "frat
rats." Such displays, which can only
bring inglorious discredit upon all
Stanford fraternities, inevitably create
an iirage entireiy contrary to that
which we have, traditionally,
painstakingly sought to create for
ourselves.
Hopefully, such vain and offensive
exhibitions will be roundly
condemned by the Stanford
community and we may all continue
to seek more mature, meaningful, and
mellow means of interpersonal
communication.

Cheers for Columbae
Editor:
The students of Columbae House
deserve the thanks of the campus
community for reminding us, iri the
Daily and on the Mem Claw fence,
that the slaughter in Vietnam

continues and that it is being paid for
by the United States. Some misguided
patriot painted over Columbae's
statement and substituted a
non-sequitur: God bless America — as
if that sentiment could erase the facts.
A more appropriate wording would
have been Thomas Jefferson's: "I
tremble for my country when I reflect
that God is just."

Ottilie's Article Humorous
Editor:
Bob Ottilie's article defending
Nixon's innocence, etc., in the January
28 Daily was really humorous. Not
being entirely facetious, it was great!
While reading it, I was laughing so hard
that I was literally crying! Imagine
that, someone finally got me to shed a
tear on Richard Nixon's behalf!
Though the article was well written,
and no doubt our freshman friend was
genuinely concerned about justice in
the "impeach Nixon" drive. I would
caution him on his use of "facts." I
attribute his lack of real retrospect to
either innocent ignorance or a simple
disregard for the intelligence of the
Stanford Community. His optimistic
view of events was so contrived that he
was very near to pulling rabbits out of
a hat.

Bob Ottilie's article defending
Nixon's innocence, etc., in the January
28 Daily was really humorous. Not
being entirely facetious, it was great!
While reading it, I was laughing so hard
that I was literally crying! Imagine
that, someone finally got me to shed a
tear on Richard Nixon's behalf!
Though the article was well written,
and no doubt our freshman friend was
genuinely concerned about justice in
the "impeach Nixon" drive. I would
caution him on his use of "facts." I
attribute his lack of real retrospect to
either innocent ignorance or a simple
disregard for the intelligence of the
Stanford Community. His optimistic
view of events was so contrived that he
was very near to pulling rabbits out of
a hat.

College Terrace Traffic
Editor:
Several writers have asked what the
College Terrace traffic problem is all
about, and understandably so. In any
discussion of that subject, it is
important to separate out the real
issues from the false ones.
First, a problem does exist. College
Terrace is a peninsula between an
industrial park and a major university
(the park being a joint city-university
venture). We all knew that when we
moved here, or should not have
expected taxable lands to remain open
forever for our convenience.
Cross-traffic therefore does exist, just
as it does in many other residential
areas of the city. That problem can be
handled by way of barricades, as
suggested by Councilman Henderson
on January 14.
Then there is the peripheral traffic
along Stanford and California
Avenues. Through traffic on Stanford
can be reduced by reasonable
deterrents (stop signs, traffic lights,
etc.), and the Industrial Park traffic on
California surely can be alleviated in
some way.
The most serious stumbling block,
however, is the vindictive attitude that
some College Terrace
"representatives" hold toward
Stanford, and their opposition to the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace

housing project. One of them in
particular, Mr. James Culpepper,
president of the College Terrace
Neighborhood Association, has
advanced what he called "a modest
plan" to block off Stanford Avenue
entirely at Bowdoin Street, diverting
all traffic onto the campus. That plan,
or a modified version that would
divert most traffic to Stanford, is
clearly unfair and unnecessary, and the
Universi y has been understandably
reluctant to go along with it.
In Mr. Culpepper's mind, that
means that Stanford "doesn't give a
damn about College Terrace," as he
told the Stanford Daily on January 28.
Such a "continued attitude of
..on-cooperation," he added
significantly, will impede the
annexation of Frenchman's Terrace to
Palo Alto. In other words, if Stanford
does not accede to his demands for an
interchange at Stanford and Bowdoin,
that is sufficient reason for Palo Alto
to reject the housing project. Heads or
tails, Mr. Culpepper wins.
The College Terrace traffic problem
can be solved if all parties act in a
responsible manner. It cannot be if
one of them uses the issue as an outlet
for his own feelings or as a means of
halting a housing project that he has
steadfastly resisted for several years.

Frat 'Childish Behavior'
Editor:
We at Zeta Psi fraternity were
dismayed to learn that members of
another major Stanford fraternity
were involved, last week, in a public
display of nudity and other childish
behavior in Meyer Library.
We have striven to foster liberated
male-female relationships over the past
several years in hopes that we could
escape the time-worn rubric of "frat
rats." Such displays, which can only
bring inglorious discredit upon all
Stanford fraternities, inevitably create
an iirage entireiy contrary to that
which we have, traditionally,
painstakingly sought to create for
ourselves.
Hopefully, such vain and offensive
exhibitions will be roundly
condemned by the Stanford
community and we may all continue
to seek more mature, meaningful, and
mellow means of interpersonal
communication.

The students of Columbae House
deserve the thanks of the campus
community for reminding us, iri the

that the slaughter in Vietnam

continues and that it is being paid for
by the United States. Some misguided
patriot painted over Columbae's
statement and substituted a
non-sequitur: God bless America — as
if that sentiment could erase the facts.
A more appropriate wording would
have been Thomas Jefferson's: "I

Cheers for Columbae
Editor:
The students of Columbae House
deserve the thanks of the campus
community for reminding us, iri the
Daily and on the Mem Claw fence,
that the slaughter in Vietnam

continues and that it is being paid for
by the United States. Some misguided
patriot painted over Columbae's
statement and substituted a
non-sequitur: God bless America — as
if that sentiment could erase the facts.
A more appropriate wording would
have been Thomas Jefferson's: "I
tremble for my country when I reflect
that God is just."

Ottilie's Article Humorous
Editor:
Bob Ottilie's article defending
Nixon's innocence, etc., in the January
28 Daily was really humorous. Not
being entirely facetious, it was great!
While reading it, I was laughing so hard
that I was literally crying! Imagine
that, someone finally got me to shed a
tear on Richard Nixon's behalf!
Though the article was well written,
and no doubt our freshman friend was
genuinely concerned about justice in
the "impeach Nixon" drive. I would
caution him on his use of "facts." I
attribute his lack of real retrospect to
either innocent ignorance or a simple
disregard for the intelligence of the
Stanford Community. His optimistic
view of events was so contrived that he
was very near to pulling rabbits out of
a hat.

College Terrace Traffic
Editor:
Several writers have asked what the
College Terrace traffic problem is all
about, and understandably so. In any
discussion of that subject, it is
important to separate out the real
issues from the false ones.
First, a problem does exist. College
Terrace is a peninsula between an
industrial park and a major university
(the park being a joint city-university
venture). We all knew that when we
moved here, or should not have
expected taxable lands to remain open
forever for our convenience.
Cross-traffic therefore does exist, just
as it does in many other residential
areas of the city. That problem can be
handled by way of barricades, as
suggested by Councilman Henderson
on January 14.
Then there is the peripheral traffic
along Stanford and California
Avenues. Through traffic on Stanford
can be reduced by reasonable
deterrents (stop signs, traffic lights,
etc.), and the Industrial Park traffic on
California surely can be alleviated in
some way.
The most serious stumbling block,
however, is the vindictive attitude that
some College Terrace
"representatives" hold toward
Stanford, and their opposition to the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace

housing project. One of them in
particular, Mr. James Culpepper,
president of the College Terrace
Neighborhood Association, has
advanced what he called "a modest
plan" to block off Stanford Avenue
entirely at Bowdoin Street, diverting
all traffic onto the campus. That plan,
or a modified version that would
divert most traffic to Stanford, is
clearly unfair and unnecessary, and the
Universi y has been understandably
reluctant to go along with it.
In Mr. Culpepper's mind, that
means that Stanford "doesn't give a
damn about College Terrace," as he
told the Stanford Daily on January 28.
Such a "continued attitude of
..on-cooperation," he added
significantly, will impede the
annexation of Frenchman's Terrace to
Palo Alto. In other words, if Stanford
does not accede to his demands for an
interchange at Stanford and Bowdoin,
that is sufficient reason for Palo Alto
to reject the housing project. Heads or
tails, Mr. Culpepper wins.
The College Terrace traffic problem
can be solved if all parties act in a
responsible manner. It cannot be if
one of them uses the issue as an outlet
for his own feelings or as a means of
halting a housing project that he has
steadfastly resisted for several years.

Frat 'Childish Behavior'
Editor:
We at Zeta Psi fraternity were
dismayed to learn that members of
another major Stanford fraternity
were involved, last week, in a public
display of nudity and other childish
behavior in Meyer Library.
We have striven to foster liberated
male-female relationships over the past
several years in hopes that we could
escape the time-worn rubric of "frat
rats." Such displays, which can only
bring inglorious discredit upon all
Stanford fraternities, inevitably create
an iirage entireiy contrary to that
which we have, traditionally,
painstakingly sought to create for
ourselves.
Hopefully, such vain and offensive
exhibitions will be roundly
condemned by the Stanford
community and we may all continue
to seek more mature, meaningful, and
mellow means of interpersonal
communication.
