# Cancer Rehabilitation Begun

A new educational program
focusing on the rehabilitation of
cancer patients has been launched
by the Division of Physical
Therapy at the Medical School.
Supported by a two-year grant
of $231,260 from the National
Cancer Institute, the program
enables Stanford physical therapy
students to work with patients
facing the difficult adjustments to
life-threatening illness and
disability.
The training effort stresses
technical knowledge and skills
required to treat cancer patients,
and especially the social and
psychological ramifications of the
disease, said Helen Blood, head of
the Division of Physical Therapy.
"Unfortunately, many health
professionals tend to avoid
working with cancer patients,"
Blood said.
"Those who do get involved

often lack specific knowledge or
have a pessimistic and fatalistic
attitude which can affect the
patients. We hope to do
something about these problems."
Under the new training plan,
45 physical therapy students are
involved in cancer rehabilitation
throughout their two-year
Master's program. The first-year
curriculum now includes
observation and supervised
treatment of patients, as well as
classroom instruction in basic
cancer terminology and therapy,
up-to-date rehabilitation
techniques, and psycho-social
aspects of working with cancer
patients and their families.
In their second year, students
may take an advanced course in
which they assume increased
responsibility for the
rehabilitation of two or three
patients and their families. Other
second-year courses have been

modified to place added emphasis
on cancer rehabilitation.
A major goal of the program,
Blood said, is to develop a model
training program which can be
adopted in whole or in part by
other physical therapy schools.

DENUDING THE KNOLL — University maintenance crews have been trimming the ivy from campus
buildings, where, as on "The Knoll" pictured above (former residence of University presidents now
housing the Music Department), the green stuff has overgrown the windows. The plants will undoubtedly
grow back, but for now, without the ivy, the "ivy-clad" walls of Stanford University will be merely
"clad." Sigh. J 3
