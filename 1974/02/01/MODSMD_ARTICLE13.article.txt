# Nisbett Obesity Theory Explains Weight Woes
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
"It may be biologically correct
for many people to be obese,"
Stanford Medical professor Albert
Stunkard said Wednesday night,
advancing the theory of
University of Michigan
psychologist Richard Nisbett.
There may be nothing wrong
with the natural regulation of
weight of obese people, Stunkard
said, but the "thermostat" around
which regulation is occurring is
simply higher.
Stunkard spoke on
"Overweight and Obesity" to an
audience of 500 in Memorial
Auditorium as part of the Progress
in Medicine lecture series
featuring recent advances in
psychiatry.
He stressed the "extraordinary
difficulties" faced by the obese in
battling weight problems, and
suggested that these problems
may be explained by the Nisbett
theory.
"If it's true that for some
people it is biologically correct to
be obese, it would account for a
great many facts," Stunkard said.
These include the obese patient's
difficulty in losing weight, his
tendency to regain it, the
tendency for his weight to rise,
and his tendency to eat fast; and
take larger bites than normal
weight individuals.
"Obese people may simply be
hungry," Stunkard stated.
He cited experimental evidence
which draws parallels between
obese people and hungry
individuals of normal weight.
At the University of Minnesota
it was demonstrated that hungry,
normal weight people tend to be
sluggish and inactive, traits
common in obese individuals.
Hungry, _ normal weight
subjects were also found to
exhibit a decrease in sex drive.
Nisbett obtained data on the sex
drive of obese males by measuring
the number. of nocturnal
emissions of students in Yale
dormitories, and found that obese
students experience fewer
emissions than those of normal
weight.
Stunkard also discussed the
exhibition of "finickiness" — the
tendency to overeat if the food is
palatable and to undereat if it is

not — in obese and normal weight
subjects. It was formerly believed,
he said, that a tendency toward
finickiness in obese individuals
demonstrated that they do not eat
out of hunger. However, it was
recently shown that normal
weight subjects who are hungry
also exhibit finickiness.
Stunkard mentioned heredity,
and early eating experiences as
primary determinants of an
individual's "set" weight. He
remarked that he has never found
any significant correlation
between obesity and neurosis,
with the exception of obese
women of upper social class. This
he explains by the "extremely
high pressure" among upper class
women to stay thin.
Stunkard suggested "falling in
love" as one of the best weight
loss inducers he has ever
witnessed. "People find their
weight melting away," he said.
"They don't even have to work at
it."
