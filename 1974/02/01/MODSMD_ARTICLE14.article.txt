# Latin News 'A Service'
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Broadcast by KZSU Monday
through Saturday at 6:15 p.m.,
the Latin American News is "a
service which the Latin American
people here should do for the
Stanford community," according
to Jorge Wertheim, program
coordinator.
Presented in Spanish, the
program attempts to give what
Latins feel is a more accurate view
of events in Latin America than
that provided by American news
sources.
Along with newspaper items
from Mexico, Latin America and
France, the radio program also
uses wire service stories from a
United Press International
teletype in Spanish. Although
Wertheim assessed the quality of
wire service news as poor, the
teletype is necessary to provide
enough news to broadcast six days
a week.
About $600 is needed to pay
the rent on the teletype machine
for the current contract period,
which ends June 16. Wertheim
says the program is seeking
sources of revenue to meet the
wire service costs and general
broadcast expenses. Until now,
the Departments of Latin
American Studies, Spanish and

Portuguese, and Communication
have contributed funds to support
the program.
"We need $2000 to continue
operating," said Wertheim,
"which, in terms of the
University, is really low."
Related to the radio program is
a SWOPSI course called "Latin
America in the U.S. Press."
Sponsored by Education Prof.
Martin Camoy, the course
compares the portrayal of Latin
America in the United States
media with other news sources.
The class evaluates newspapers
from Argentina, Brazil and Chile,
as well as Le Monde from France
and the Excelsior from Mexico
City.
Most of the people in the
SWOPSI class are American.
Wertheim, who is also one of the
workshop leaders, viewed the
enrollment with approval. At the
end of the course, class
participants will discuss the results
of their studies. "I think the
outcome will be very radical,"
Wertheim predicted.
