# Arnett's Staff Studying Legal Death Definition
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The staff of Assemblyman
Dixon Arnett, R-Redwood City, is
researching the possibility of
proposing a bill which would
legally define death during this
year's legislature.
This action comes in the wake
of court cases in Oakland and
Santa Rosa in which the defense
attorneys are arguing that the
removal of the victim's heart for
transplant purposes rather than
their defendant's actions, was the
cause of death.
Arnett, former director of
community relations here,
emphasize that the procedure is
only in the "exploratory stage."
He said most of the efforts so
f~- have been examining past
work done by the California
Medical Association and the siate
attorney general's office.
Both have previously made
recommendations that no
guidelines be added to the law,
which currently states that a
physician must declare a potential
donor dead, but doesn't establish
the criteria to be used.
Chuck Cavalier, Arnett's
administrative assistant, said he is
not sure what type of a legal
definition would be proposed, but
definite guidelines "would be
advantageous."
Arnett remarked that
"anything but a first degree
murder conviction" in the
Oakland case, "will put doctors in

jeopardy." The defendant in
Santa Rosa is accused of
manslaughter, and any other
decision in that case could also
hinder future attempts to
transplant hearts of "dying" or
"dead" murder and accident
victims.
Arnett emphasized that "If
anything is going to be done, it's
going to be done this year." The
deadline for submitting bills is
April 15, but Arnett could submit
a tentative proposal then, and
amend the bill when he is
convinced his staff has done a
"decent scholarly job,"
Bill McClure, a legislative
intern and senior at UC-Davis, has
been doing the research so far. He
is planning on meeting with
representatives from the attorney
general's office soon to discuss the
issue.
Arnett also mentioned the
possibility of a clause which
would release the doctors from
responsibility if the family of the
potential donor gives its
permission and is satisfied of
death.
