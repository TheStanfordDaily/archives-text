# Film Shows Two Styles
## 
### PAUL YEUELL 
Escape movies appeal to the
trapped hero in everyone. Set in a
cluster of prison islands off the
coast of British Guinea, Papillon
depicts the struggle of two men
whose lives have been irretrievably
stolen from them by the French
penal system.
The two men are Steve
McQueen as Papillon and Dustin
Hoffman as Degas, and the story
is how they endeavor to survive
and even prevail in the face of
formidable odds.
The odds are so formidable
that Papillon's obsession with
escape needs no explaination
outside of the action of the
movie. For example, in the first
scenes, officious prison wardens
welcome the prisoners with
warning speeches to the French
penal system "from which there is
no escape."
Ocean Metaphor
Isolated from the world by vast
stretches of ocean, the prison
confinement becomes a striking
metaphor for common life. But
unlike most common lives, some
form of ghastly violence appears
about every ten minutes (movie
tirrie) to emphasize the tenuous
nature of existence.
The powerful effect of the
film, however, is not the violence,
of which there is more than
enough. Nor is it the adventure,
which is fair, but heavy on
jungle-running and slow-motion
cliff-falling.
The merit of the film is in the
portrait of these two men
condemned to the most difficult
and thretening existence
imaginable and how they come to
deal with their imprisonment.
Even though Hoffman and
McQueen play predictable roles,
the movie does not suffer for it.
Knack For Survival
Papillon (McQueen) is a "pimp
killer" who swears to his
innocence. He's strong and young

and displays his knack for
surviving early in the movie by
slashing the faces of a pair of
prisoners on their way to cutting
open Degas (Hoffman).
Degas is a French counterfeiter
who is remarkably clever but
physically a wimp. He is even

afforded a damaged leg and a
good limp, a visual image that has
become familiar in American films
for expressing the inability to act.
Papillon, then, is the
chronology of their lives spent in
prison. For Papillon, that means
endeavoring to escape or serving
the punishment for trying to.
Different Strategy
But Degas survives differently.
His style is to accomodate and to
compromise. Through good
behavior and a pay-off, he attains
a trustee's position and reasonable
treatment. Only through a chance
happening does Degas become
involved in one of Papillon's
escapes, and then it is against his
will.
Throughout the film, the
disparity between the two men —
Degas, the keeper, and Papillon,
the seeker — is maintained quite
well. While Degas wants only to
live, Papillon is seething with the
notion that his life has been
"wasted."
The two respect the disparity
and finally, as old men whose lives
have passed them by, they part. In

Entertainment

a well-controlled scene on the
windy seapcliffs of Devil's Island,
they embrace; Papillon, a white
haired old man losing his teeth
and Degas, a forgotten man losing
his mind.
Papillon leaps into the sea and
floats away on a bag of coconuts

to whatever fate the tides deliver
him.
The movie is effective despite
the heavy use of gore for color
and its excessive length. It works
because the difference between
the two styles of dealing with life
— keeping and seeking — is
well-presented.
