# John Lee Hooker's Blues Band 'Polished'
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
SAN FRANCISCO — Veteran bluesman John Lee Hooker has
solved one of the major problems of nightclub shows by careful
selection of a warmup band. Saturday night at the Great American
Music Hall, Cold Feet, a yearling blues-rock band which has become
Hooker's regular warmup act, opened the show and established the
evening's blues contract with the audience.
Cold Feet's subject matter is mostly original music. The group is
composed of two guitars, bass, organ, and drums. As in most blues
bands, Cold Feet tends toward simplified, skeletal progressions that
allow for both vocal and instrumental variations.
The group's lead guitarist, who sang all but two of the solos in the
first set, executed most of the solo exchanges between voice and
guitar in a style that was as reminiscent of rock in tempo as it was of
blues structurally. The slower blues pieces retained an aspect of rock
music that can only be attributed to the vocalists themselves.
Hooker's five-piece band, originating in the San Francisco-Oakland
area, began its first set at around 10:30. The first three or four
numbers were performed without Hooker, who entered ten to fifteen
minutes later. The lead guitarist, who has been with the band for the
past three years, displayed his ability as a soloist early in the set,
proving to the audience that the band is carried by more than Hooker
himself.
The contrast of age and depth between Cold Feet and Hooker's
band was evident in Hooker's opening song. The group, even without
Hooker, is noticeably more polished, precise, and committed to blues
than Cold Feet and other "young" bands.
Recently, Hooker completed a six-week tour of Canada. In the
next month, the group plans to be performing at Keystone in
Berkeley, with Cold Feet, apd at the Orphanage in San Francisco.
John Lee Hooker is a blues experinece not to be missed; together with
Cold Feet, it can be a memorable evening.
