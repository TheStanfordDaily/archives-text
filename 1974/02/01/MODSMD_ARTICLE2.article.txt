# Stations May Close At Midnight
## Local Gas Dealers To Vote On Strike 
### BILL ROSS 
The Santa Clara County chapter of the National
Service Station Dealers' Association (NSSDA) will
meet this afternoon to decide whether or not to go
on strike, effective at midnight tonight.
About 600 of the 800 service stations in the
county are members of the NSSDA, which was
organized five months ago in San Jose.
Rising costs and shrinking profits have forced
many deaiers to consider the possibility of going on
strike.
"The bureaucrats in Washington are insensitive to
our problems," declared Ed MacKay, a director of
, the NSSDA. "Oil dealers can raise their prices, but
the government froze ours. We're going to try to
show that we aren't going to stand for it."
"The idea of going on strike is to try to influence
the government's Wage and Price Board to amend
the profit freeze," said Gary Andrews, manager of
Campus Shell on Serra Street, the station closest to
Stanford. "Something must be done to help the
station owners stay in business."
Although Andrews said he has raised prices
several cents per gallon in the last year, the
government is holding all stations to the profit

margin of May 15, 1973, with only a one cent
allowance for profit rise.
"Paper, windshield towels, insurance â€”
everything has gone up since then," Andrews said.
"Inflation has really cut into our profits."
Salaries have also gone up. Andrews recently gave
a service mechanic a 40 percent raise in order to
keep him from leaving the station. Several gas
pumpers have had their salaries raised from $2.30 to
$2.80 per hour.
"This is the worst inflation that I've seen in 20
years in the gas business," Andrews said. "Costs are
high in the Bay Area, and the government's control
agencies should take factors such as that into
consideration. Instead, they have imposed uniform
and arbitrary controls. They should consider the
fact that in Georgia a man will pump gas for $1.60
an hour, but that in California wages are much
higher."
Andrews hasn't had to close his station because
he has carefully allocated his gas supply. He has
been closed on Sundays since June, and is now
closing each day around noon.
"Customers are more confused than angry,"
Andrews said. "There haven't been many

complaints. Most customers just want to be able to
buy gas."
His customers from Stanford have varying
reactions to the shortage. Some who could ride
bikes without any problem, are less bothered than
those who must depend upon automobiles for their
transportation.
Andrews has not yet decided whether he will
participate in any strike called by the NSSDA, but
he leans toward non-involvement.
He doubts whether a strike would succeed. "We
are swamped with business now, and not very many
dealers would be willing to create the severe
financial hardships that a strike would cause."
In a strike, all emergency vehicles would be
serviced, Mac Kay said. Police cars and ambulances
wouldn't have to do without gas.
Although many Bay Area service stations are
open only a few days each month, 30 to 40 percent
would be permanently forced out of business if the
existing situation doesn't change in the next few
months, according to MacKay.
MacKay's station in Menlo Park is open nine
hours a day five days a week, with gas sold on a first
come, first served basis.
