# Ozawa, Serkin Please Brahms Fans

### KENNETH DeLONG 
SAN FRANCISCO - By and
large, Brahms fans are not as noisy
as a lot of their Wagnerian
counterparts, but they are
certainly just as devoted. The San
Francisco Symphony's
presentation of an all-Brahms
concert during the third week of
January drew a packed house of
Brahmsians who were highly vocal
in their praise of the evening's
activities.
A large proportion of the
applause was directed at pianist
Rudolf Serkin for his dynamic
and exciting performance of the
Second Piano Concerto in B flat.
The program also included
another large and meaty work
from Brahms' mature years, the
Third Symphony.
The symphony was performed
first and received a strong and
rhythmic performance at the
hands of conductor Seiji Ozawa.
Ozawa emphasized the stern and

argumentative side of the work.
Tempe were cautious and the
appeal was more to the intellect
than to the senses.
In the middle movements the
severity was relaxed and the
poetic side of the composer
emerged, significantly assisted by
beautifully played clarinet and
horn solos. The third movement,
popularized by its incessant
repetition during the movie The
L-Shaped Room, was gracefully
played and thoroughly effective.
Some Lack of Warmth
If the performance had a
weakness it would be its lack of
romantic warmth. French
sentiment and piquant orchestral
color a la Berlioz cannot be
directly equated with slightly
self-indulgent and sentimental
German Romanticism. Ozawa's
temperament seems more French
then German and despite his
legato line and heavy breathing,
the result lacks the romantic

warmth one looks for in Brahms.
Still, an aggressive and didactic
view of the symphony has its own
merits. This reviewer found the
performance both respectable and
enjoyable.
After intermission, Rudolf
Serkin joined the orchestra for a
strong and vigorous performance
of the B-flat concerto. Serkin has
a reputation as one of the pianist
giants of our time, and his
entrance was welcomed by a
sustained burst of applause.
Simplicity, Elegance
The concerto started well with
fine playing from the solo horn,
but momentum flagged slightly
during the opening movement,
and a sense of nervousness could
not be concealed. Serkin dropped

some notes, and there was a
suspicion of memory difficulties.
All of this was set aside after the
first movement, and he performed
the remainder of the concerto
brilliantly. Especially satisfying
was the way in which the long
lines of the slow movement were
drawn. Serkin's control of
phrasing and dynamics is
remarkable and his performance
of this movement was notable for
its simplicity and elegance.
Serkin is one of the few great
pianists of today with the mental
and physical stamina necessary for
this work. He has a real affinity
for Brahms' style, and the result
was a performance of great
musical merit, showing the
outstanding quality of his musical
intelligence.
