# Jazz-Blues Innovator Dave Alexander Here
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Ever since the first Dixieland band blew its first notes some six
or so decades ago, jazz musicians have continually relied upon
blues as their major influence and one of their most frequent forms
of self-expression. After all, that's where jazz began.
But, the reverse has seldom been the case, and never the rule.
Only a handful of bluesmen have had any professional experience
in jazz bands, and fewer have incorporated it into their blues;
T-Bone Walker, Cleanhead Vinson, Lonnie Johnson, and a few
others.
The newest proponent of this jazz-blues school is a 35-year-old
Bay Area pianist named Dave Alexander.
Like many Bay Area bluesmen, Alexander was raised in Texas,
He has played with nearly every bluesman ever to come to or near
the area; Jimmy McCracklin, Lowell Fulson, Charley Musselwhite,
L.C. Robinson.
Blues has always been a music short on innovators. Alexander's
first two LPs for Arhoolie mark one of the "newest" things to
come to blues since Little Walter decided to blow his harmonica
through a microphone.
Shades of Mose Allison, Horace Silver, and Nat Cole are all
blended into Alexander's piano and vocal work. Through
Alexander, that highly influential art form known as the blues is
finally recycling itself back into its own music.
Alexander will perform Monday in Burbank Lounge, Stern Hall
at 7 p.m. as part of the "History of the Blues," Undergraduate
Special 7. Admission is free, provided you get there on time.
