# IM Roundup
## Poor Gavilan 
### PETE BHATIA 
Intramural basketball's answer
to the Philadelphia 76ers did it
again this week. Gavilan '72,
rapidly becoming the biggest joke
on campus next to John McKay,
fell to the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, 102-24. Gavilan
tried something different this
week, adding a girl to its
starting lineup.
Dean "Jerry West" Hashimoto
popped in nine points to lead the
Gavilan output. Mike "Wilt"
Whenley had seven and that girl,
Linda "Stretch" Hodson added
two.
For the band, the leading
scorers were "Jorge" Fukumoto

with 28, "Juan" Hamada with 24,
and "Enrique" Anderson with 22.
LSJUMB's Steve Baird, awed
by Gavilan's mighty attack, said
after the game, "They had four
guys and a girl, and that's about
it."
But seriously folks, at least
Gavilan shows up to play every
week despite the fact they get
crushed. That's better than a lot
of teams can manage.
In other action, SAE, last
year's semi-finalist, was upset in
overtime by The Mighty Mites
60-58. SAE led 31-28 at the half
but the Mites quickly overcrawled
that lead and the score was tied
50 all at the end of regulation.
Steve Blodgetts' bucket with
less than a minute to go proved to
be the winner for the Mites.
The Mite victory overshadowed
a fine 20-point effort by SAE's
Bob Rondeau. Rondeau, most
noted for being another insane
pre-med, hit eight baskets and was
4-7 from the charity stripe.
In next week's featured game,
the undefeated Phi Delts meet the
undefeated Culos Tuesday at 6:30
p.m. The taller Phi Delts are
favored by 11 points.
* * *
In IM Soccer, SIDEC Educ. I
edged Biz I Al 3-2 and established
itself as a definite championship
contender. Biz was considered by
many to be the best IM soccer
team. However, SIDEC is not the
only undefeated team left in the
regular season competition. The
Bachacs also look very tough as
they have won all their games by
at least four goals. That translates
to winning in basketball by about
40 points.
Due to the great number of
rescheduled games, the IM office
has decided that absolutely no
more games will be rescheduled in
regular season play. There will be
no exceptions to this rule.
* * *
In Table Tennis the second
round has been completed and the
field has been narrowed to 32
teams. Twain I, the top seed,
advanced easily with a 3-0 victory
over Adelfa 2. Third round
pairings are posted at the IM
office in Encina Gym. The same
rule applies as before — both
teams will be dropped unless the
match result is reported to the IM
office by 5 p.m. Monday.

Anyone planning to participate
in the IM gymnastics, wrestling or
weightlifting meets should start
getting ready. All three meets are
scheduled during the last week of
February and the first week of
March. Entries are still being
accepted.

noted for being another insane
pre-med, hit eight baskets and was
4-7 from the charity stripe.
In next week's featured game,
the undefeated Phi Delts meet the
undefeated Culos Tuesday at 6:30
p.m. The taller Phi Delts are
favored by 11 points.

In IM Soccer, SIDEC Educ. I
edged Biz I Al 3-2 and established
itself as a definite championship
contender. Biz was considered by
many to be the best IM soccer
team. However, SIDEC is not the
only undefeated team left in the
regular season competition. The
Bachacs also look very tough as
they have won all their games by
at least four goals. That translates
to winning in basketball by about
40 points.
Due to the great number of
rescheduled games, the IM office
has decided that absolutely no
more games will be rescheduled in
regular season play. There will be
no exceptions to this rule.

In Table Tennis the second
round has been completed and the
field has been narrowed to 32
teams. Twain I, the top seed,
advanced easily with a 3-0 victory
over Adelfa 2. Third round
pairings are posted at the IM
office in Encina Gym. The same
rule applies as before — both
teams will be dropped unless the
match result is reported to the IM
office by 5 p.m. Monday.

Anyone planning to participate
in the IM gymnastics, wrestling or
weightlifting meets should start
getting ready. All three meets are

February and the first week of
March. Entries are still being

Intramural basketball's answer
to the Philadelphia 76ers did it
again this week. Gavilan '72,
rapidly becoming the biggest joke
on campus next to John McKay,
fell to the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, 102-24. Gavilan
tried something different this
week, adding a girl to its
starting lineup.
Dean "Jerry West" Hashimoto
popped in nine points to lead the
Gavilan output. Mike "Wilt"
Whenley had seven and that girl,
Linda "Stretch" Hodson added
two.
For the band, the leading
scorers were "Jorge" Fukumoto

with 28, "Juan" Hamada with 24,
and "Enrique" Anderson with 22.
LSJUMB's Steve Baird, awed
by Gavilan's mighty attack, said
after the game, "They had four
guys and a girl, and that's about
it."
But seriously folks, at least
Gavilan shows up to play every
week despite the fact they get
crushed. That's better than a lot
of teams can manage.
In other action, SAE, last
year's semi-finalist, was upset in
overtime by The Mighty Mites
60-58. SAE led 31-28 at the half
but the Mites quickly overcrawled
that lead and the score was tied
50 all at the end of regulation.
Steve Blodgetts' bucket with
less than a minute to go proved to
be the winner for the Mites.
The Mite victory overshadowed
a fine 20-point effort by SAE's
Bob Rondeau. Rondeau, most
noted for being another insane
pre-med, hit eight baskets and was
4-7 from the charity stripe.
