# Ruggers Hope To Extend Win Streak
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The Stanford rugby squad will
be trying to extend its winning
streak to four games tomorrow
when the Cards meet the
Peninsula Ramblers at 1:30 p.m.
on the Stanford field.
The Ramblers have
traditionally been known as a
physical squad which might more
aptly be called the Rumblers.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
feels they'll live up to their
nickname tomorrow.
Last year the Ramblers, with
the aid of Jack Schultz (now with
the Stanford team), beat the
Cards 16-3, but Kmetovic says
that the Ramblers have changed a
great deal. "They're a younger
team than they used to be. But
they still have some very
experienced players and they're
still a hard-hitting team."
Craig Zaltosky was responsible
for two of Stanford's comeback
victories, and now that he's out of
the season, Kmetovic must rebuild
the offense. "I'll probably use
John Armstrong and Dave Weil in
the backfield. But it will still be
hard to replace Craig," Kmetovic
also plans to move Schultz into
the second line to fill another
open spot.
For the past two weeks the
Cards have had to make
last-minute comebacks to win, but
if Kmetovic has his way this will
change tomorrow. "I think the
kids haven't really been coming to
play. It has taken them a half to
realize that they're playing a real
game. But I think they'll come to
play tomorrow."
