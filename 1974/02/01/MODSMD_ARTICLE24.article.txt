# Wrestlers Tie Chico, Prepare For Oregon
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Earlier this week wrestling Coach Joe De Meo theorized that
yesterday's match against Chico State was going to be a good test for
the Card wrestlers. It turned out to be the perfect test, as the teams
battled to a 21-21 tie, kicking off a three-match northern trip for
Stanford.
De Meo had much to be happy about, but a few disappointments.
Stanford took five of eight contests, with each squad forfeiting once.
But Jim Tatarakis (126) and Jim Rappaport (142) were pinned, giving
up six points each. Emmett Stanton (158), wrestling for the first time
in about a month, suffered a 6-2 setback, and Chico had its 21 points.

Two of Stanford's wins were
one-sided. Roy Tolles (190) had
an easy 7-1 win after Marc Frelier
breezed to an 8-1 decision.
Earlier, in an exciting match,
Marc Yancey (134) worked for a
5-3 win, scoring the Card's first
points. Jeff Richardson (167) and
Charlie Masch (150) each edged
their opponents by a single point,
7-6 and 5-4 respectively, for the
visitor's scoring.
With nothing gained and
nothing lost in their first night's
action, the grapplers will move up
to Eugene, where they will face
Oregon tonight. The Ducks have
one of the best teams in the
nation, which spells trouble for
the Cards, whose two best
wrestlers are injured.
Still, De Meo said the
encounter will be a good test for
some of his grapplers. For others,
it may be a test of courage.
Tomorrow should be an easier
match, as the Cards take on
Oregon Tech & Pacific University
in Klamath Falls. But it will be
the third match in as many days,
which, along with travelling, could
weary the wrestlers.
But De Meo was confident that
the Cards could chalk this one up
in the win column. Doing so, and
assuming an Oregon setback,
would leave the team with a
respectable 6-6-1 record.
De Meo got some good news
earlier this week. Chris Horpel,
who was injured earlier in the
year, successfully went through
surgery on Monday, and is on the
way to a hopefully rapid recovery.
Horpel, a senior, redshirted
after being hurt, and should be
one of the key wrestlers on next
year's squad. He was a pre season
Ail-American candiate, and was
undefeated before his injury.

yesterday's match against Chico State was going to be a good test for
the Card wrestlers. It turned out to be the perfect test, as the teams
battled to a 21-21 tie, kicking off a three-match northern trip for
Stanford.
De Meo had much to be happy about, but a few disappointments.
Stanford took five of eight contests, with each squad forfeiting once.
But Jim Tatarakis (126) and Jim Rappaport (142) were pinned, giving
up six points each. Emmett Stanton (158), wrestling for the first time
in about a month, suffered a 6-2 setback, and Chico had its 21 points.

Two of Stanford's wins were
one-sided. Roy Tolles (190) had
an easy 7-1 win after Marc Frelier
breezed to an 8-1 decision.
Earlier, in an exciting match,
Marc Yancey (134) worked for a
5-3 win, scoring the Card's first
points. Jeff Richardson (167) and
Charlie Masch (150) each edged
their opponents by a single point,
7-6 and 5-4 respectively, for the
visitor's scoring.
With nothing gained and
nothing lost in their first night's
action, the grapplers will move up
to Eugene, where they will face
Oregon tonight. The Ducks have
one of the best teams in the
nation, which spells trouble for
the Cards, whose two best
wrestlers are injured.
Still, De Meo said the
encounter will be a good test for
some of his grapplers. For others,
it may be a test of courage.
Tomorrow should be an easier
match, as the Cards take on
Oregon Tech & Pacific University
in Klamath Falls. But it will be
the third match in as many days,
which, along with travelling, could
weary the wrestlers.
But De Meo was confident that
the Cards could chalk this one up
in the win column. Doing so, and
assuming an Oregon setback,
would leave the team with a
respectable 6-6-1 record.
De Meo got some good news
earlier this week. Chris Horpel,
who was injured earlier in the
year, successfully went through
surgery on Monday, and is on the
way to a hopefully rapid recovery.
Horpel, a senior, redshirted
after being hurt, and should be
one of the key wrestlers on next
year's squad. He was a pre season
Ail-American candiate, and was
undefeated before his injury.
