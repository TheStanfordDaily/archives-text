# Arizona Invades Maples
## Gymnasts Face 'Mystery' Wildcats 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
In the wake of last week's
opening loss to California and
Oregon, the Stanford gymnastics
team should have an easier time
tomorrow as the Cards face
Arizona at 8 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
"Arizona's somewhat of a
mystery team," said coach Sadao
Hamada. "We don't really know
much about them except that
they used to be good a few years
ago. Basically, we're expecting
them to be a little sloppy on
form, but with a lot of spectacular
moves."
Hamada has spent the week
attempting to iron out the rough
spots which showed up in the
routines last week. He is putting
special emphasis on the high bar
and parallel bars â€” two events
that cost the Cards victory last
weekend. "We're going to have
five guys in each event, including
those two," said Hamada. The top
three in each event determine the
team score.
Hug Impressive
Steve Hug is expected to have
another fine meet following last
weekend's impressive double
victory in the all-around. Hug won
the compulsories Friday night at
Berkeley with a 54.15 total for
the six events (the routines are
scored on a 10-point scale). Back
on home ground Saturday, he

scored a 55.2 total, highlighted by
a 9.5 parallel bars routine.
Ted Marcy will be out to better
his team-leading 9.6 sidehorse
score, earned last week in the
compulsories. Other outstanding
performers for the Cards last week
were Howard Beesen, who swung
to a 9.4 rings score in the
optionals, and Bob Anderson,
who hit a 9.2 high bar routine
Saturday.
Anderson, along with Ted
Miyamoto, will be backing up Hug
in the all-around again tomorrow.
Arizona's lineup lists only one
all-around competitor, Paul Werst.
This lack of all-around performers

underlies Arizona's greatest
weakness.
Three Entrants
Although they have more
competitors entered than the
Cards, all except Werst are listed
for only one or two events. In
four of the six events, they have
only three entrants.
Stanford, on the other hand,
lists five men for each event, thus
leaving them a much greater
margin for mistakes. It was a lack
of depth which proved to be
Stanford's undoing last week, and
for this meet the tables will be
turned.
Besides the three all-around

men, the Cards have few multiple
event performers. Shawn Skerrett,
whose specialty is the vault, will
also compete in floor exercise and
parallel bars. Denny Meleniez will
perform on the sidehorse, parallel
bars and high bar, and is also a
possibility for the vault. Bob
Horwitz should have a high bar
routine ready this week, and may
vault as well.
Howard Bessen and George
Negrete are specializing on the
rings again this week. Bessen will
be out to better his 9.4 score of
last Saturday. Marcy on sidehorse
and Bill Madsen in floor exercise
complete the Stanford lineup.
