# Card Golfers Battle Two Traditional Rivals
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford hopes to defeat two of its biggest golf rivals this
afternoon when the Cards host an 18-hole tournament on the
Stanford course.
Six teams are entered in the medal play event, including San Jose
State and California. Last week Cal upset the Cards 14V4-12V& at
Franklin Canyon Country Club, snapping a 23-year Stanford winning
streak over the Bears and prompting Card coach Bud Finger to vow,
"They won't beat us again for another 33 years."
The San Jose rivalry has been less one-sided, but even more heated.
Cardinal-Spartan duels have continually gone down to the final green
in recent years, including several ties and one-stroke decisions. Last
year Stanford and San Jose State battled inconclusively for Bay Area
golf supremacy throughout the year before the Spartans settled the
question with a fourth place finish in the NCAA's (Stanford missed
the cut.)

"We have the utmost respect
for both San Jose and Cal," said
junior George Pettinger, "but we
should have the edge on our
course."
Pettinger, who fired a
one-over-par 73 last week at
Franklin Canyon, joins juniors
Aly Trompas (73), Conrad
Nilmeier (74) and Dave Baskins
(75) and freshmen Glenn Goethels
(78) and Brent Murray in today's
starting lineup.
Murray, who eagled the 18th
hole in the freshman match last
Friday (the shot gave Stanford a
13V&-13V& tie), earned his varsity
spot in a long series of challenge
matches earlier this week.
Eight players competed
Monday and Tuesday for the right
to challenge Tom Mason, who
recorded the highest score (83) in
last week's match. Murray
prevailed in that test with scores
of 70-77, and then defeated
Mason on Wednesday, 73-76.
Murray's one-under-par 70 on
Monday included a front nine
score of 33, three under par. He
used only 10 putts in the nine
holes.
"The guy evidently knows how
to get the ball in the cup," Finger
understated.
Top challengers for today's
individual title include San Jose's
Mark Lye, Cal's Don Compton
and any one of the four Cardinal
juniors. Rounding out the team
field are Cal State Hayward, San
Francisco State, Santa Clara and
possibly USF. Stanford's
freshman team hosts Foothill
College in a 2:30 p.m. dual match.
Next Friday, the varsity will
compete in the second battle in a
season-long war with San Jose,
traveling to San Jose Country
Club for a 12:30 p.m. dual match.

to get the ball in the cup," Finger
understated.
Top challengers for today's
individual title include San Jose's
Mark Lye, Cal's Don Compton
and any one of the four Cardinal
juniors. Rounding out the team
field are Cal State Hayward, San
Francisco State, Santa Clara and
possibly USF. Stanford's
freshman team hosts Foothill
College in a 2:30 p.m. dual match.
Next Friday, the varsity will
compete in the second battle in a
season-long war with San Jose,
traveling to San Jose Country
Club for a 12:30 p.m. dual match.
Stanford hopes to defeat two of its biggest golf rivals this
afternoon when the Cards host an 18-hole tournament on the
Stanford course.
Six teams are entered in the medal play event, including San Jose
State and California. Last week Cal upset the Cards 14V4-12V& at
Franklin Canyon Country Club, snapping a 23-year Stanford winning
streak over the Bears and prompting Card coach Bud Finger to vow,
"They won't beat us again for another 33 years."
The San Jose rivalry has been less one-sided, but even more heated.
Cardinal-Spartan duels have continually gone down to the final green
in recent years, including several ties and one-stroke decisions. Last
year Stanford and San Jose State battled inconclusively for Bay Area
golf supremacy throughout the year before the Spartans settled the
question with a fourth place finish in the NCAA's (Stanford missed
the cut.)

"We have the utmost respect
for both San Jose and Cal," said
junior George Pettinger, "but we
should have the edge on our
course."
Pettinger, who fired a
one-over-par 73 last week at
Franklin Canyon, joins juniors
Aly Trompas (73), Conrad
Nilmeier (74) and Dave Baskins
(75) and freshmen Glenn Goethels
(78) and Brent Murray in today's
starting lineup.
Murray, who eagled the 18th
hole in the freshman match last
Friday (the shot gave Stanford a
13V&-13V& tie), earned his varsity
spot in a long series of challenge
matches earlier this week.
Eight players competed
Monday and Tuesday for the right
to challenge Tom Mason, who
recorded the highest score (83) in
last week's match. Murray
prevailed in that test with scores
of 70-77, and then defeated
Mason on Wednesday, 73-76.
Murray's one-under-par 70 on
Monday included a front nine
score of 33, three under par. He
used only 10 putts in the nine
holes.
"The guy evidently knows how
to get the ball in the cup," Finger
understated.
