# Volleyball Team Hosts Collegiate Champions
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Defending NCAA volleyball
champion San Diego State invades
Maples Pavilion Sunday to take on
the promising Cardinals in
Stanford's first home encounter
of the season.
Game time is 3:30 p.m. with
admission 50 cents for students
and $1 for the general public.
San Diego State upset Long
Beach State in the collegiate finals
last year and coach Jack Henn
returns four players from that
team.
Two of them, Chris Marlow
and Mike Cote, started for last
year's champions. Marlow is a first
team All-American.
Henn said, "We are not the
best team in our conference this
year. We're suffering from lack of
experience since we lost four
starters from last year."
Stanford player Willie Mannon
doesn't take solace in Henn's
remarks. Mannon said, "When you
consider that teams in their
conference like USC and UCSB
are the best in the country, being
the conference's third best team
could be the third best in the
nation."
'Freaks'
The Aztecs, billed as "freaks"
last year by Sports Illustrated,
could better be billed, according
to Stanford's George McPheeters,
as "surfers, super enthusiastic, and
abounding in natural talent."
Stanford will counter the
Aztecs with perhaps its best team

ever.
The Cards' top player is Jim
lams, a senior. McPheeters says
lams "would have been an
Ail-American had he played
anywhere besides Stanford." At
Stanford, unlike most California
colleges, volleyball is not a varsity
sport.
lams did earn honorable
mention All-American honors two
years ago, and is currently playing
in open competition for the
Olympic club of San Francisco.
Other Stanford players
include:
—Steve Hoch, a senior; a great
leaper and hitter.
—Tom Duralde, a freshman
who has the potential to become
one of the nation's top players.
McPheeters credits Duralde with
"all the natural attributes and an
amazing ability to hit equally hard
with both hands."
—Mannon, junior; a good hitter
and blocker.
—McPheeters, junior; an
excellent setter.
—freshman Richard Rand,
senior Bill Rix and sophomore
Kyle Mashima.
Opening Loss
The Cards opened their season
two weeks ago when they fell to
UC-Santa Barbara in Santa
Barbara.
A screaming, standing-room
only crowd of 5,000 witnessed
that match, which the Gauchos
won 11-6, 12-10, 11-7. At UCSB
volleyball outdraws basketball.

McPheeters credited the Cards
with "a good effort," considering
the match was immediately
following Christmas break.

finished third in a Santa Barbara
invitational tourney beind UCSB
and an All-Star team featuring
three Olympians and Rick
Raffero, who has played with

Opening Loss
The Cards opened their season
two weeks ago when they fell to

that match, which the Gauchos

volleyball outdraws basketball.

FUTlLlTY—Stanford didn't have a fair chance to stop this spike by
Wilt Chamberlain of the Big Dippers last spring. Sunday, though, the
opposition will be somewhat less imposing as the volleyballers host
defending NCAA champion San Diego State at Maples Pavilion. Game
time is 3:30 p.m.
Defending NCAA volleyball
champion San Diego State invades
Maples Pavilion Sunday to take on
the promising Cardinals in
Stanford's first home encounter
of the season.
Game time is 3:30 p.m. with
admission 50 cents for students
and $1 for the general public.
San Diego State upset Long
Beach State in the collegiate finals
last year and coach Jack Henn
returns four players from that
team.
Two of them, Chris Marlow
and Mike Cote, started for last
year's champions. Marlow is a first
team All-American.
Henn said, "We are not the
best team in our conference this
year. We're suffering from lack of
experience since we lost four
starters from last year."
Stanford player Willie Mannon
doesn't take solace in Henn's
remarks. Mannon said, "When you
consider that teams in their
conference like USC and UCSB
are the best in the country, being
the conference's third best team
could be the third best in the
nation."
'Freaks'
The Aztecs, billed as "freaks"
last year by Sports Illustrated,
could better be billed, according
to Stanford's George McPheeters,
as "surfers, super enthusiastic, and
abounding in natural talent."
Stanford will counter the
Aztecs with perhaps its best team

ever.
The Cards' top player is Jim
lams, a senior. McPheeters says
lams "would have been an
Ail-American had he played
anywhere besides Stanford." At
Stanford, unlike most California
colleges, volleyball is not a varsity
sport.
lams did earn honorable
mention All-American honors two
years ago, and is currently playing
in open competition for the
Olympic club of San Francisco.
Other Stanford players
include:
—Steve Hoch, a senior; a great
leaper and hitter.
—Tom Duralde, a freshman
who has the potential to become
one of the nation's top players.
