# Relay Team Enters S.F. Indoor Meet
## 
### 
The 1974 Stanford track
season unofficially gets underway
tonight when coach Payton
Jordan leads a contingent of eight
Cardinals to the San Francisco
Indoor Games at the Cow Palace.
Four of Stanford's top
quarter-milers will run in the
University Open mile relay.
Stanford will be going for its third
consecutive victory in the relay,
having won the event in 1972 and
1973.
"It should be quite an
excellent meet," said Jordan. "It
would be quite a precedent if we
can pull it [winning the mile
relay] off again. We will be facing
Cal, San Jose State and the Bay
Area Striders in the race, and
while the Striders may challenge
us with their experience, you
never know what will happen
when Cal and Stanford step on
the same track."
John Siirila, a freshman from
Santa Clara, will lead off the
quartet. Veterans John Kessel and
Matt Hogsett will run the second
and third legs, while another
freshman, Scott Wingo of Visalia,
anchors the relay.
"The relay is faster at this time
of the season than it was at a
comparable point last year," said
Jordan. "Kessel and Hogsett ran
on the relay that broke the world
record last year in Pocatello, so
they are used to running the big
race. The freshmen on each end
will have a real challenge to make
it [the win streak] stick."
Dave Bagshaw will also be
competing, running the 60-yard
high hurdles at 9:10 p.m. Mark
McConnel and Tony Sandoval run
in the Open two-mile four
minutes later, a race Jordan calls
"one of the two truly outstanding
events of the night."
