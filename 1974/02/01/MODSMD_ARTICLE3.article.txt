# Pub Board Gives Funds To 'Chappie,' 'Live Oak'
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
' The ASSU Publications Board
voted 5-4 yesterday to give $1500 to
both the existing magazine, Chaparral,
and the proposed newspaper Live Oak.
The grant to the Chaparral means
that three 16- to 20-page issues will be
published before the end of the school
year, according to the magazine's
editor.
The more controversial Live Oak
grant was given as "seed money" for
the weekly newspaper, whose sponsors
plan to begin publishing the paper in
the fall.
According to the prospectus
submitted by Bill Weinstein, who will
serve as Live Oak's editor and
advertising manager, the new
publication plans to serve as a
competitor to the Daily. Published
every Friday, Live Oak would offer

news, features, opinions,
entertainment and sports of interest to
the general Stanford community,
much as does the Daily.
Alumni Gifts Sought
Live Oak plans to gather the
remaining $20,000 necessary to start
up and maintain such a publication for
one year through alumni gifts and
advertising revenue. During the
90-minute debate preceeding the vote,
the board examined both funding
sources.
Quad Publisher Mason Blacher
asked Weinstein for the source of the
$8500 in gifts Live Oak expects to
receive. "Money has bought papers
before," Blacher noted.
Weinstein answered that the paper
had rejected funds coming from
sources who would attempt to dictate
the political or religious viewpoint of
the publication.
However, at least some of the
donors to Live Oak do hold strong
political views. According to
Weinstein, $2000 has been pledged by
a group represented by Lowell Berry, a
leader of the New Founders League, a
right-wing alumni group. Stanford
Advocates, a libertarian student group
here, has also expressed interest in
contribution to Live Oak.
'Alternative' Publication
The other main issue discussed by
the Pub Board centered around the
advisability of starting a newspaper
that would cover essentially the same
ground as the Daily — and would
certainly compete with the Daily for
advertising revenue.
Chaparral Publisher Tim Coburn
questioned the wisdom of splitting the
meager advertising funds available to
publications. Chaparral Editor Mark
Lee views the Chaparral, which will
become a magazine printing longer
articles than does the Daily, as an
"alternative" rather than a
"competitor."
Money Book Manager Jim Baer, on

the other hand, noted that advertising
volume is largely dependent on the
quality of a publication's salesmen.
Baer thought it was possible for one
person to raise the $10,000 in
advertising revenue Live Oak will
require next year.
Daily Business Manager Mike
Kruger said "I'm not particularly
worried about losing advertising
revenue," to Live Oak. However,
Kruger said he opposed the
disbursement of funds to Live Oak
"40 percent because of lack of
business viability, 40 percent because
of lack of editorial viability, and 20
percent because I question some of
Bill's advertising techniques."
Eventually, Baer moved that $1500
be given to each publication. The Pub
Board's financial review committee
had implicitly suggested that only a
total of $1500 be given out, but Pub
Board Chairman Gordon Imrie said the
Pub Board's anticipated income would
more than cover the additional $1500
expense.
Baer's proposal passed 5-4, the
Chaparral casting both its votes in
favor of the proposal to give itself
money, the Daily casting both its votes
against the motion.
After the vote, Imrie recessed the
meeting — he said he would adjourn it
some time after midnight this
morning, so that the Pub Board could
fulfill its constitutional requirement of
meeting in February.
Both Weinstein and Lee expressed
satisfaction at the outcome of the
vote. Lee said that the next Chaparral
would be published "at least two
weeks before the end of the quarter."

every Friday, Live Oak would offer

news, features, opinions,
entertainment and sports of interest to
the general Stanford community,
much as does the Daily.
Alumni Gifts Sought
Live Oak plans to gather the
remaining $20,000 necessary to start
up and maintain such a publication for
one year through alumni gifts and
advertising revenue. During the
90-minute debate preceeding the vote,
the board examined both funding
sources.
Quad Publisher Mason Blacher
asked Weinstein for the source of the
$8500 in gifts Live Oak expects to
receive. "Money has bought papers
before," Blacher noted.
Weinstein answered that the paper
had rejected funds coming from
sources who would attempt to dictate
the political or religious viewpoint of
the publication.
However, at least some of the
donors to Live Oak do hold strong
political views. According to
Weinstein, $2000 has been pledged by
a group represented by Lowell Berry, a
leader of the New Founders League, a
right-wing alumni group. Stanford
Advocates, a libertarian student group
here, has also expressed interest in
contribution to Live Oak.
'Alternative' Publication
The other main issue discussed by
the Pub Board centered around the
advisability of starting a newspaper
that would cover essentially the same
ground as the Daily — and would
certainly compete with the Daily for
advertising revenue.
Chaparral Publisher Tim Coburn
questioned the wisdom of splitting the
meager advertising funds available to
publications. Chaparral Editor Mark
Lee views the Chaparral, which will
become a magazine printing longer
articles than does the Daily, as an
"alternative" rather than a
"competitor."
Money Book Manager Jim Baer, on

the other hand, noted that advertising
volume is largely dependent on the
quality of a publication's salesmen.
Baer thought it was possible for one
person to raise the $10,000 in
advertising revenue Live Oak will
require next year.
Daily Business Manager Mike
Kruger said "I'm not particularly
worried about losing advertising
revenue," to Live Oak. However,
Kruger said he opposed the
disbursement of funds to Live Oak
"40 percent because of lack of
business viability, 40 percent because
of lack of editorial viability, and 20
percent because I question some of
Bill's advertising techniques."
Eventually, Baer moved that $1500
be given to each publication. The Pub
Board's financial review committee
had implicitly suggested that only a
total of $1500 be given out, but Pub
Board Chairman Gordon Imrie said the
Pub Board's anticipated income would
more than cover the additional $1500
expense.
Baer's proposal passed 5-4, the
Chaparral casting both its votes in
favor of the proposal to give itself
money, the Daily casting both its votes
against the motion.
After the vote, Imrie recessed the
meeting — he said he would adjourn it
some time after midnight this
morning, so that the Pub Board could
fulfill its constitutional requirement of
meeting in February.
Both Weinstein and Lee expressed
satisfaction at the outcome of the
vote. Lee said that the next Chaparral
would be published "at least two
weeks before the end of the quarter."
' The ASSU Publications Board
voted 5-4 yesterday to give $1500 to
both the existing magazine, Chaparral,
and the proposed newspaper Live Oak.
The grant to the Chaparral means
that three 16- to 20-page issues will be
published before the end of the school
year, according to the magazine's
editor.
The more controversial Live Oak
grant was given as "seed money" for
the weekly newspaper, whose sponsors
plan to begin publishing the paper in
the fall.
According to the prospectus
submitted by Bill Weinstein, who will
serve as Live Oak's editor and
advertising manager, the new
publication plans to serve as a
competitor to the Daily. Published
