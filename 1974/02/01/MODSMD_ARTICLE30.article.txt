# Women's Basketball
## Furious Comeback Nips Cal 
### STEVE SOULE 
Girls will be girls . . . but not till after the game,
as the Stanford Women's basketball team showed
Wednesday night in defeating its counterpart from
California, 33-28.
For two hours the Stanford players laced up
their shoes and hit the court, quite often literally,
before returning to their street clothes and
reviewing the game with the Cal players over
cookies and cider. The post game get-together is
great for developing friendship between
competitors, and it's unfortunate that the custom is
unique to women's basketball.
The two teams treated the 100 enthusiastic fans
to a fine game, as Stanford rallied furiously from a
nine-point fourth quarter deficit to win by five.
The Cardinals trailed by nine to open the period,
but closed the gap to four with three minutes to
play. Then coach Shirley Schoof called for a full
court zone press, which rattled Cal and led to three
quick layins for Stanford.
Up by two with 40 seconds to play, senior Paula
Johnson calmly sank a technical foul shot, and the
Cards stalled until senior Terri Borchers sank a
basket at the buzzer to provide the final five-point
margin. When it was all over, Stanford had whipped
the Bears 16-2 in the closing frame. .
Borchers, with 10 points, and southpaw
freshman Kathy Levinson were the top scorers for
Stanford. Levinson bucketed 11, mostly on long set
shots over the sagging Cal zone.
While Borchers and Levinson were providing the
outside punch, Johnson was cleaning up inside. She
scored only five points, but was instrumental in the
Cardinal win, dominating the boards at both ends,
particularly during Stanford's big comeback.
Marina Ballatyne and Carol Sawyer rounded out
the scoring for the Cardinals, with four and three
points respectively.
In .IV action, Stanford nipped Cal 45-39, in a
see-saw battle that went right down to the wire.
Karen Stomsmoe, 14, and Pat Cornett, 10, paced
