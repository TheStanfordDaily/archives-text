# Resurgent Cagers Seek First Conference Win
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
If strengths imply strategies,
California coach Dick Edwards
has tonight's Stanford-Cal battle
figured all wrong.
"Brady Allen is probably the
best defensive player I've had in
11 years of coaching," Edwards
enthused Tuesday at the Northern
California Basketball Writer's
luncheon. "Game after game he
does a tremendous job on our
opponents' top guard."
Stanford, Cal's opponent
tonight in an 8 p.m. game at
Maples Pavilion, boasts a top
guard averaging 4.7 points a game.
So much for defense. Aliens'
efforts may be wasted.
Up front, however, the Bears
will need ali the defense they can
muster. Starting for Stanford is
Rich Kelley (7-0), Ed Schweitzer
(6-BV2) and Tim Patterson (6-11).
That combination accounted for
60 points and 32 rebounds last
week in Stanford's 108-62 romp
over Denver.
"I was at Stanford last Friday
and if I could have cancelled the
game at that point I would have,"
Edwards said. "Stanford was
awesome up front — they present
an obvious problem for us because
of their size."
Different Problems
Stanford and Cal have similar
records (6-9 for the Cards, 7-9 for
the Bears), but the problems are
different. Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar has been searching for the
right backcourt combination,
while Edwards' worries are in the
frontcourt.
Tonight, guards Allen and
Rickie Hawthorne (14.0 average)
are sure starters, but the
frontcourt situation remains in

doubt. Junior John Terry is "very
probable" at one forward. Either
Rock Lee or Erik Vaaler (up from
the JVs), will start at center and
any one of several may open at
the other forward. Senior Carl
Meier is the probable starter, but
senior Bill Kellar could get the
nod. Freshmen Doug Vilotti and
Jim Griffith are also under
consideration.
Dallmar, meanwhile, lists
Melvin Arterberry and Jim
Montague as his backcourt
starters. Arterberry will guard
Hawthorne if the Cards ever
abandon their zone defense, and
Dallmar is looking to Montague to
provide a sorely needed outside
threat.
Set Tempo
Montague was shaky in earlier
starts, but against Denver he hit

on six of his eight field goal
attempts and "set the tempo of
our offense," according to
Dallmar.
Ben Bluitt, the third leading
field goal shooter in the Pac-8,
should also see considerable
action at guard.
Stanford is still winless in the
conference, a fact that makes
Dallmar disturbed, but not
downtrodden. "We've had so
many close games and games
where we've let leads slip
away it's too bad we
couldn't spread some of those
points from the Denver game over
some of the disappointments of
the past few weeks," Dallmar said.
"Obviously, though, we would
like to see the momentum of last
weekend carry over into
conference play, especially with
three home games in a row
coming up [Washington and
Washington State next weekend].
"Cal is much like us," Dallmar
continued, "a good team that has
been up and down, and they have
lost some tough ones."
And how does Edwards
appraise the Cards? "Rich Kelley
is an outstanding center, but I'm
impressed by their entire front
line," Edwards said. "They're so
big, and shoot so well."
Still, Edwards predicts "a close
game," a prognostication
supported by last year's 73-68 and
70-66 Stanford victories.

Cardinal Notes: Cal athletic
director Dave Maggard announced
yesterday that the March 1 game
between UCLA and Cal would be
played at the Oakland Coliseum
instead of Harmon Gym.
Cal leads the "Big Game" series
109-71 in games dating back to
1912.
Kelley is right on schedule
toward matching last year's
figures in both scoring and
rebounding. Kelley needs only to
average 17.0 points per game (he's
presently at 17.5) to match his
1972-73 point total of 433. In the
rebounding department, he
presently has 193 and still has a
chance to reach last year's record
total of 433.
Stanford's average attendance
is 5616 — 417G at home and 6576
on the road.

SUPERSUB — Archie Dean, who scored seven points last week against
Denver, was one of 11 Cardinals who contributed to the 108-62 rout.
Dean could see spot action tonight against California.
