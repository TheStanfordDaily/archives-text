# Jones: Card JVs 'Can Beat Anybody'
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
With their coach sounding more optimistic by the moment,
Stanford's junior varsity basketballers take on the California JV
;onight at Maples at 6 p.m.
"We can beat California — I'm sure about that," says Cardinal
x>ach Billy Jones. "If we play as well as we can, we can beat
my body."
And so the man who said before the season that his team would
'be outmanned every time we go to center court" has come full
:ircle. The reason is his team's performance thus far this season.
Playing as a group of unrecruited athletes against schools with
land-picked cagers, the JV has compiled a 4-5 record, including near
nisses against Menlo College and the San Jose State JV, both teams
'as good as we'll play," says Jones.

Tonight the Cards face a new
challenge: 6-6 Bear freshman Don
Weaver from Mills High at
Burlingame, who scored 42 points
n last week's Cal JV win over San
lose State, one hoop short of the
Berkeley record.
"He is either one heck of a
jood offensive player or will be
oon," says Cal varsity head coach
Dick Edwards. "He needs
mprovement defensively and in
>ther phases of the game, and I
ust don't know if he can score
ike that on varsity."
Tonight Stanford will find out
112 he can score like that against
he Card JV.
"If he gets 40 and the rest get
ix, I'll be satisfied," says Jones,
vho plans no special defense for
Veaver. Jones says he's "not
eally" worried about any of the
Jears, either.
However, California, now 10-4
>n the season, "has scholarship
ithletes on the JV level," Jones
ays. He feels the Bears "have
iood size" but are "capable of
laving a running team," and he
xpects Cal to employ a full-court
>ress.
Weaver, despite his 42-point
ffort, is averaging just 20 points
>er game, but still dwarfs the
learest Stanford regular (Marty
loroski, 12.9 average).

Tonight the Cards face a new
challenge: 6-6 Bear freshman Don
Weaver from Mills High at
Burlingame, who scored 42 points

Berkeley record.
"He is either one heck of a
jood offensive player or will be

Dick Edwards. "He needs

ust don't know if he can score
ike that on varsity."
Tonight Stanford will find out
112 he can score like that against
he Card JV.
"If he gets 40 and the rest get
ix, I'll be satisfied," says Jones,
vho plans no special defense for
Veaver. Jones says he's "not
eally" worried about any of the
Jears, either.
However, California, now 10-4

ays. He feels the Bears "have

my body."
And so the man who said before the season that his team would
'be outmanned every time we go to center court" has come full
