# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Overflowing with
confidence and eager to
improve his 22-12 record, the
Daily's fearless forecaster
returns this week after
protecting his job with a dutch
6-1 performance last weekend.
It would have been 7-0 if
Oregon coach Dick Harter
hadn't intimidated the refs in
Saturday's televised game
against Oregon State.
After padding the league's
intersectional record for two
consecutive weekends (the
Pac-8 is 58-32 against
non-conference competition),
league teams return to Pac-8
action this weekend with
"traditional rival" competition.
Three of those contests count
in the league standings, while
the Oregon-Oregon State game
at Portland is a non-conference
affair which counts only in the
battle for the Chancellor's
Trophy, presented annually to
the winner of the three-game
circus between the two teams.
According to some

statistical gymnastics
performed by the Pac-8
publicity office, Bill Walton
needs just 17 more rebounds to
bypass Lew Alcindor and move
into second place on the
all-time conference rebounding
list. Alcindor grabbed 1167
rebounds during his UCLA
career. First place is occupied
by Mel Counts, who corralled
1375 rebounds for Oregon
State in 1962-64.
Walton is averaging 16.0
rebounds per game during his
college career. If he maintained
that exact average, and if
UCLA were to win the Pac-8
title and play four more games
in the NCAA tournament,
Walton would finish with 1375
rebounds â€” dead even with
Counts.
Walton will eventually
surpass Counts, and the
following will occur this
weekend:
Stanford 79, Cat 67
Oregon St. 62, Oregon 61
UCLA 91, USC 74
Washington 73, WSU 65
