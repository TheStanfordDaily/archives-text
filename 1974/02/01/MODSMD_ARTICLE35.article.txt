# 'Doggone Good' Trojans Meet Invincible Bruins
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Coach
Bob Boyd of Southern California
says he has a "dog-gone good
team," but it's still the Avis of
college basketball in Los Angeles.
"We're going to have our time
at the top some day,"says Boyd,
but that day is unlikely to come
this year as his nationally
llth-ranked, 14-2 Trojans travel
across town to play the UCLA
Bruins at Pauley Pavilion.
Coach John Wooden's Bruins,
15-1, returned to No. 1 in the
polls by beating Notre Dame,
94-75, last Saturday night,
avenging a 71-70 defeat at South
Bend that snapped the record
88-game winning streak.
The Bruins take a two-game
winning streak against the
Trojans, who have won five in a
row, but UCLA can still build on
a pair of impressive streaks — 60
straight victories at Pauley
Pavilion and 47 straight Pac-8
triumphs.
. Ironically, Notre Dame had
been the last team to beat UCLA
before breaking the streak, and
USC is the last team to upset the
Bruins at Pauley, 87-86 in March,
1970. Since then UCLA has won
all seven meetings against USC, by
margins of 13, 4, 11, 25, 13, 23
and 20 points.
The Bruins are 128-2 in

eight-and-a-half years at Pauley,
and USC provided the other
defeat, 46-44, in a slowdown
1969 contest.
Boyd won't resort to stalling
tactics, he said, "because this
team is too good for that."
To have a chance, Boyd said,
the Trojans must:
"Hit a high percentage of
shots, somewhere in the
neighborhood of 50 percent, and
be somewhat selective in the shots
we take. If we have a choice, the
shots should come after we have a
chance to set up our offense.
"The shot shouldn't come in
the first two seconds after we
break down court. We have to
take good care of the basketball.
This takes away from the obvious
problem of defensing Bill Walton.
"We have to have some effect
on curtailing their key scorers —
particularly Walton. I watched
UCLA's game with Notre Dame
on television, and he kept turning
right for his short hook and inside
for his short jumper. If he gets the
ball there, he can make baskets all
day. He's unstoppable in close."
The Trojans probably will be
short-handed because of
center-forward Clint Chapman's
knee injury as they take a 3-1
Pac-8 record against the 4-0
Bruins.
