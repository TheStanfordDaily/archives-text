# Olympic Gold Medalist John Hencken
## More Than A World Champion Swimmer 
### STEVE BAKER 
Walking into trailer 23-X in Manzanita Park,
you'd hardly know that a world champion
swimmer lived there. The first thing you notice as
you step in is a mini-bike leaning against the wall.
Off in one corner a time-worn television set sits,
rescued from the cobwebs of antiquity. And
standing between these objects in an almost bizarre
contrast is an aquarium, curiously void of any
inhabitants.
The only hint one gets from the interior of this
trailer that it houses one of Stanford's greatest
athletes is a photograph of an Olympic gold medal.
But unlike the circular disc that hung from the
neck of its winner in Munich, this medal assumes a
more oval shape, thanks to a clever photographer
whose film captured it in water.
23-X is the home of John Fredrick Hencken.
And to say he is just an Olympic and world
champion would do him injustice. He's more.
Sophomore electrical engineering major and
mechanical fiend, John leaves swimming in the
swimming pool, and is only reminded of it by the
vague photograph of a past'accomplishment. "I'm
not like most swimmers. Out of the swimming
pool, I totally forget about swimming. I've been at
it long enough. It's natural by now."
Hencken makes sure he leaves swimming behind
when he gets home by finding time for his studies
and hobbies. He built the mini-bike (which happens
to be electric). He has also put together a light
organ and a moog synthesizer. The rejuvenated
television set can be connected to the stereo or the
synthesizer to provide visual interpretations of
music. On the side, John makes his own root beer.
Incomparable Ferocity
In the pool, John Hencken the electrical
engineer becomes John Hencken the swimmer. One
of the world's premier breaststrokers, he attacks
swimming with incomparable ferocity. When John
turns on the speed he rides high on the water,
propelled by a powerful pull and a driving kick.
Unlike most breaststrokers, John's strength comes
from his arms. This isn't to slight his kick, but John
considers himself a better puller than a kicker.
With a career that dates back some nine years to

the old Berkeley YMCA, John's family now lives in
Santa Clara. In the summer, he swims long course
with the Santa Clara Swim Club under Olympic
coach George Haines.
At the age of 13, John made his national debut
in the 1968 Olympic Trials in Long Beach. But the
first meet to put John Hencken in the big time was
the 1972 Olympic Trials in which he placed second
in both the 100 and 200-meter breaststroke. In his
second big meet, the Olympics, John placed third
in the 100 and took the gold in the 200. His time
of 2:21.55 won by nearly three body-lengths over
the closest competitor. Some observers felt that he
sneaked away from the field but John sees the race
differently. "I took it from the first lap, and I think
people were skeptical whether I could hold on." If
there was any skepticism, it didn't last long.
Many Successes
Hencken's successes haven't been limited to
Munich. Just this last summer at the World

Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia John broke
the world record in the 100-meter breast by nearly
a second in 1:04.02. In the 200, he was narrowly
beaten by Great Britain's David Wilkie, clocking a
2:19.8 to Wilkie's 2:19.3. Both broke the old world
record. In the 1973 NCAA's John won the 100,
was third in the 200 and swam on Stanford's
medley relay which placed fourth.
The only setback for John in '73 came at the
Santa Clara International Swim Meet in July. John
disqualified his American record-breaking relay by
accidently jumping back into the water before
others had finished. But, like everything else he
does, John took it in stride.
Currently Hencken ranks first in the 200 breast
and, in something of a surprise to him, second in
the 200 individual medley. He also provides a leg to
Stanford's second-ranked medley relay.
What makes John go on, totally unfazed by
pressure? Confidence. A quiet confidence that can

easily be detected by his relaxed personality. John
knows he can do well, so he doesn't have to talk
about it. He has goals set for himself, but avoids
making predictions.
One would think that the pressure of being on
top would constantly nag him. "It [the pressure]
doesn't bother me that much. I don't think about
it. Sure you like to win, but I don't think about it
anymore. When anybody asks me how I'm going to
do, I say I don't know. I'm just trying to improve."
To John, winning is secondary to improvement.
It just so happens that he wins besides. But John
keeps things in perspective. When asked why he
chose Stanford, John cited the electrical
engineering program, the people at Stanford and a
desire to stay in the Bay Area.
Will he be around for the Olympics in Montreal
in 1976? "I think I'll be around ... in fact I
wouldn't miss it!"
What makes trailer 23-X even more unique is the
fact that living with John are two fellow swimmers
and an aspiring swim coach. Paul Clark and Rick
Lambert, both oustanding competitors, make the
twice-daily bike ride with John to the pools. Clark,
an individual medleyist, is a psych major while
Lambert, a butterflier, is challenging life as a
pre-med. The aspiring swim coach is Brian Biro,
also a psych major. Biro, from Reseda, California,
couldn't be getting a better preparation for his
future plans anywhere else.
And yet the irony of it all is that empty
aquarium. Twice John, Paul, Rick and Brian tried
to get some fish to live there, and both times all the
fish died. It couldn't be the environment, could it?

John Hencken Splashes To Another Victory
Walking into trailer 23-X in Manzanita Park,
you'd hardly know that a world champion
swimmer lived there. The first thing you notice as
you step in is a mini-bike leaning against the wall.
Off in one corner a time-worn television set sits,
rescued from the cobwebs of antiquity. And
standing between these objects in an almost bizarre
contrast is an aquarium, curiously void of any
inhabitants.
The only hint one gets from the interior of this
trailer that it houses one of Stanford's greatest
athletes is a photograph of an Olympic gold medal.
But unlike the circular disc that hung from the
neck of its winner in Munich, this medal assumes a
more oval shape, thanks to a clever photographer
whose film captured it in water.
23-X is the home of John Fredrick Hencken.
And to say he is just an Olympic and world
champion would do him injustice. He's more.
Sophomore electrical engineering major and
mechanical fiend, John leaves swimming in the
swimming pool, and is only reminded of it by the
vague photograph of a past'accomplishment. "I'm
not like most swimmers. Out of the swimming
pool, I totally forget about swimming. I've been at
it long enough. It's natural by now."
Hencken makes sure he leaves swimming behind
when he gets home by finding time for his studies
and hobbies. He built the mini-bike (which happens
to be electric). He has also put together a light
organ and a moog synthesizer. The rejuvenated
television set can be connected to the stereo or the
synthesizer to provide visual interpretations of
music. On the side, John makes his own root beer.
Incomparable Ferocity
In the pool, John Hencken the electrical
engineer becomes John Hencken the swimmer. One
of the world's premier breaststrokers, he attacks
swimming with incomparable ferocity. When John
turns on the speed he rides high on the water,
propelled by a powerful pull and a driving kick.
Unlike most breaststrokers, John's strength comes
from his arms. This isn't to slight his kick, but John
considers himself a better puller than a kicker.
With a career that dates back some nine years to

the old Berkeley YMCA, John's family now lives in
Santa Clara. In the summer, he swims long course
with the Santa Clara Swim Club under Olympic
coach George Haines.
At the age of 13, John made his national debut
in the 1968 Olympic Trials in Long Beach. But the
first meet to put John Hencken in the big time was
the 1972 Olympic Trials in which he placed second
in both the 100 and 200-meter breaststroke. In his
second big meet, the Olympics, John placed third
in the 100 and took the gold in the 200. His time
of 2:21.55 won by nearly three body-lengths over
the closest competitor. Some observers felt that he
sneaked away from the field but John sees the race
differently. "I took it from the first lap, and I think
people were skeptical whether I could hold on." If
there was any skepticism, it didn't last long.
Many Successes
Hencken's successes haven't been limited to
Munich. Just this last summer at the World

Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia John broke
the world record in the 100-meter breast by nearly
a second in 1:04.02. In the 200, he was narrowly
beaten by Great Britain's David Wilkie, clocking a
2:19.8 to Wilkie's 2:19.3. Both broke the old world
record. In the 1973 NCAA's John won the 100,
was third in the 200 and swam on Stanford's
medley relay which placed fourth.
The only setback for John in '73 came at the
Santa Clara International Swim Meet in July. John
disqualified his American record-breaking relay by
accidently jumping back into the water before
others had finished. But, like everything else he
does, John took it in stride.
Currently Hencken ranks first in the 200 breast
and, in something of a surprise to him, second in
the 200 individual medley. He also provides a leg to
Stanford's second-ranked medley relay.
What makes John go on, totally unfazed by
pressure? Confidence. A quiet confidence that can

easily be detected by his relaxed personality. John
knows he can do well, so he doesn't have to talk
about it. He has goals set for himself, but avoids
making predictions.
One would think that the pressure of being on
top would constantly nag him. "It [the pressure]
doesn't bother me that much. I don't think about
it. Sure you like to win, but I don't think about it
anymore. When anybody asks me how I'm going to
do, I say I don't know. I'm just trying to improve."
To John, winning is secondary to improvement.
It just so happens that he wins besides. But John
keeps things in perspective. When asked why he
chose Stanford, John cited the electrical
engineering program, the people at Stanford and a
desire to stay in the Bay Area.
Will he be around for the Olympics in Montreal
in 1976? "I think I'll be around ... in fact I
wouldn't miss it!"
What makes trailer 23-X even more unique is the
fact that living with John are two fellow swimmers
and an aspiring swim coach. Paul Clark and Rick
Lambert, both oustanding competitors, make the
twice-daily bike ride with John to the pools. Clark,
an individual medleyist, is a psych major while
Lambert, a butterflier, is challenging life as a
pre-med. The aspiring swim coach is Brian Biro,
also a psych major. Biro, from Reseda, California,
couldn't be getting a better preparation for his
future plans anywhere else.
And yet the irony of it all is that empty
aquarium. Twice John, Paul, Rick and Brian tried

John Hencken Splashes To Another Victory
Walking into trailer 23-X in Manzanita Park,
you'd hardly know that a world champion
swimmer lived there. The first thing you notice as
you step in is a mini-bike leaning against the wall.
Off in one corner a time-worn television set sits,
rescued from the cobwebs of antiquity. And
standing between these objects in an almost bizarre
contrast is an aquarium, curiously void of any
inhabitants.
The only hint one gets from the interior of this
trailer that it houses one of Stanford's greatest
athletes is a photograph of an Olympic gold medal.
But unlike the circular disc that hung from the
neck of its winner in Munich, this medal assumes a
more oval shape, thanks to a clever photographer
whose film captured it in water.
23-X is the home of John Fredrick Hencken.
And to say he is just an Olympic and world
champion would do him injustice. He's more.
Sophomore electrical engineering major and
mechanical fiend, John leaves swimming in the
swimming pool, and is only reminded of it by the
vague photograph of a past'accomplishment. "I'm
not like most swimmers. Out of the swimming
pool, I totally forget about swimming. I've been at
it long enough. It's natural by now."
Hencken makes sure he leaves swimming behind
when he gets home by finding time for his studies
and hobbies. He built the mini-bike (which happens
to be electric). He has also put together a light
organ and a moog synthesizer. The rejuvenated
television set can be connected to the stereo or the
synthesizer to provide visual interpretations of
music. On the side, John makes his own root beer.
Incomparable Ferocity
In the pool, John Hencken the electrical
engineer becomes John Hencken the swimmer. One
of the world's premier breaststrokers, he attacks
swimming with incomparable ferocity. When John
turns on the speed he rides high on the water,
propelled by a powerful pull and a driving kick.
Unlike most breaststrokers, John's strength comes
from his arms. This isn't to slight his kick, but John
considers himself a better puller than a kicker.
With a career that dates back some nine years to

the old Berkeley YMCA, John's family now lives in
Santa Clara. In the summer, he swims long course
with the Santa Clara Swim Club under Olympic
coach George Haines.
At the age of 13, John made his national debut
in the 1968 Olympic Trials in Long Beach. But the
first meet to put John Hencken in the big time was
the 1972 Olympic Trials in which he placed second
in both the 100 and 200-meter breaststroke. In his
second big meet, the Olympics, John placed third
in the 100 and took the gold in the 200. His time
of 2:21.55 won by nearly three body-lengths over
the closest competitor. Some observers felt that he
sneaked away from the field but John sees the race
differently. "I took it from the first lap, and I think
people were skeptical whether I could hold on." If
there was any skepticism, it didn't last long.
Many Successes
Hencken's successes haven't been limited to
Munich. Just this last summer at the World

Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia John broke
the world record in the 100-meter breast by nearly
a second in 1:04.02. In the 200, he was narrowly
beaten by Great Britain's David Wilkie, clocking a
2:19.8 to Wilkie's 2:19.3. Both broke the old world
record. In the 1973 NCAA's John won the 100,
was third in the 200 and swam on Stanford's
medley relay which placed fourth.
The only setback for John in '73 came at the
Santa Clara International Swim Meet in July. John
disqualified his American record-breaking relay by
accidently jumping back into the water before
others had finished. But, like everything else he
does, John took it in stride.
Currently Hencken ranks first in the 200 breast
and, in something of a surprise to him, second in
the 200 individual medley. He also provides a leg to
Stanford's second-ranked medley relay.
What makes John go on, totally unfazed by
pressure? Confidence. A quiet confidence that can

easily be detected by his relaxed personality. John
knows he can do well, so he doesn't have to talk
about it. He has goals set for himself, but avoids
making predictions.
One would think that the pressure of being on
top would constantly nag him. "It [the pressure]
doesn't bother me that much. I don't think about
it. Sure you like to win, but I don't think about it
anymore. When anybody asks me how I'm going to

To John, winning is secondary to improvement.
It just so happens that he wins besides. But John
keeps things in perspective. When asked why he
chose Stanford, John cited the electrical
engineering program, the people at Stanford and a
desire to stay in the Bay Area.
Will he be around for the Olympics in Montreal
in 1976? "I think I'll be around ... in fact I
wouldn't miss it!"
What makes trailer 23-X even more unique is the
fact that living with John are two fellow swimmers
and an aspiring swim coach. Paul Clark and Rick
Lambert, both oustanding competitors, make the
twice-daily bike ride with John to the pools. Clark,
an individual medleyist, is a psych major while
Lambert, a butterflier, is challenging life as a

also a psych major. Biro, from Reseda, California,
couldn't be getting a better preparation for his

fish died. It couldn't be the environment, could it?
