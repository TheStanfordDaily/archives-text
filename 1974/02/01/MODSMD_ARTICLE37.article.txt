92 Die In Pan Am Jet Crash
NEW YORK — A Pan American World Airways
707 jetliner crashed and bumed on a landing
approach at Pago Pago, Samoa, yesterday and 92 of
the 101 persons aboard died, the airline said.
Pan American said 10 survivors were pulled from
the wreckage. But one of them, Joan Merrill, 52, of
Altaloma, Calif., died later in a hospital. Her
husband, Maury, 54, was among the hospitalized.
His condition was not known, a Pan Am spokesman
said.
He said the plane went down 1000 yards short of
the runway during heavy rain squalls and burst into
flames. The flight carried 91 passengers and a crew
of 10, including 35 Americans. The time was eight
minutes before midnight in Samoa, Wednesday
(3:52 a.m. PDT yesterday).
Most passengers were believed to be from New
Zealand and Western Samoa.
Pago Pago is on one of the seven islands of
American Samoa in the mid-Pacific. It lies a little
over a third of the way between New Zealand and
the Hawaiian Islands.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was
in contact with aviation authorities in the South
Pacific but had no information on the crash other
than what already had been reported.
The crash was the third involving a Pan American
jetliner in the past seven months.
Panel Seeks Subpoena Power
WASHINGTON — A unanimous House Judiciary
Committee voted yesterday to seek broad authority
to subpoena White House documents and witnesses
for its impeachment inquiry.
By voice vote, the 21 Democrats and 16
Republicans on the committee approved a
resolution that would confer on it full authority to
conduct the investigation and to get complete access
to any information it needs.
Approval by the full House is expected Tuesday,

setting the stage for a possible confrontation
between the committee and President Nixon.
The committee was advised by special counsel
John M. Doar that the House had unqualified
subpoena powers under the Constitution in
impeachment investigations.
Terrorists Firebomb Oil Tank
SINGAPORE — Four men set fire to a Shell oil
storage tank here yesterday, then seized five
hostages aboard a ferry and threatened to kill
themselves and the hostages unless they got safe
conduct to an Arab country, officials said.
The Singapore government said it would meet
the terrorists' conditions. The four demanded a
plane and asked to trade their hostages for the
Japanese ambassador and his secretary.
But yesterday morning the 80-foot ferry Laju
still sat in Singapore harbor, surrounded by at least
15 police patrol boats and navy gunboats, awaiting
arrival of a plane to take the four terrorists to the
Middle East.
A Japan Air Lines plan? delayed in Bangkok,
Thailand, was thought to be ready to fly to
Singapore to pick up the terrorists, but the airline
said later that the plane had returned to Tokyo.
The Japanese ambassador, Okichiro Uomoto,
who was taking part in the negotiations, described
the four terrorists as "polite and well-educated."
In Beirut, Lebanon, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for
the attack.
A statement said the operation was staged by
Palestinian guerrillas and members of the Japanese
Red Army in retaliation for the "aggressive role of
oil companies and the government of Singapore
against the Arab people in general and the
Palestinian people in particular."
'Evidence Supports Dean Story'
WASHINGTON — An assistant special Watergate
prosecutor says the government has no evidence to
prove that presidential accuser John W. Dean 111 lied
under oath. "Based on the evidence we have
accumulated so far we have no reason for believing
that Mr. Dean has committed perjury in any
proceeding," Richard Davis said in federal court. It
was the first statement from the office of Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski directly contradicting
Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., who says the White House
has evidence that Dean lied.
Scott was unavailable for comment.
Dean has told the Senate Watergate committee
that he left a meeting with President Nixon Sept.
15, 1972, feeling that the President was aware "of
what had been going on regarding the success of
keeping the White House out of the Watergate
scandal."
A tape recording of that meeting is in the hands
of the prosecutors and grand jury.
Dean also swore the President said Watergate
defendant E. Howard Hunt had been promised
executive clemency and that paying hush money
was no problem. Nixon denied making the
statements.
Meanwhile, the prosecutors who have handled
the Watergate cover-up investigation and White
House lawyers met yesterday with Chief U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica. The subject discussed
at the 45-minute gathering was not disclosed, and
the transcript was sealed.
Th ree Murdered In Oakland
OAKLAND — The hacked and stabbed bodies of
three mortuary employees were discovered in a
blood-spattered funeral home yesterday — one of
them sprawled in the chapel among knocked-over
pews.

Police said one of the victims was a Vietnam
veteran who put up a terrific struggle before he was
killed.
Deputy Police Chief Tom Donahue said there
was nothing to connect this latest multiple slaying
to a random shooting spree in San Francisco
Monday night in which four persons were shot dead.
Police said it appeared the only things missing in
the mortuary killings were several pints of
embalming fluid. One of them was shattered on a
sidewalk near the Albert Brown Mortuary.
Senate To Probe Alleged Spying
WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed Services
Committee voted yesterday to investigate alleged
high-level military spying on Henry A. Kissinger
which was uncovered by the White House plumbers
operation during their investigation of news leaks.
Chairman John C. Stennis, D-Miss., said the
committee decided at a closed session to ask
Kissinger and Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to testify on the matter
next week.
"After they have been heard the committee will
decide what further steps to take," Stennis said.
Stennis said he has spent much of his time in
recent weeks looking into reports that certain
national security documents were transmitted
without authority from the National Security
Council headed by Kissinger to Moorer's office at
the Pentagon.
A 1971 White House investigation of news leaks
turned up evidence that White House military aides
were passing unauthorized information about
National Security Council proceedings to the
Pentagon.
The Pentagon has said overzealousness by the
aides was responsible for the action but denied
national security was threatened.
Soldiers Terrorize Viet Refugees
SAIGON — Local authorities and landowners are
paying soldiers to terrorize refugees and drive them
away from resettlement homesites wanted by land
speculators, South Vietnamese officials said
yesterday.
The officials' comments, in reply to a reporter's
questions, came after a raid on a resettlement area
Monday where soldiers killed an old woman and
wounded several other refugees.
A Buddhist leader said the refugees told him they
were attacked by three unidentified men firing
grenade launchers and rifles. Someone returned later
and replaced the empty cartridges from the
American-made weapons with empty shells from the
kind of weapons carried by the Viet Cong.
One government official, who asked not to be
identified, said such acts sometimes are "instigated
by a corrupt mili ry commander, sometimes by a
regional tycoon, sometimes by a Catholic priest who
hates Buddhists." Many refugees are Buddhists.
State Oil, Gas Production Down
SACRAMENTO — California's oil and natural gas
production continued to shrink considerably in
1973, the state Division of Oil and Gas said in a
report yesterday.
Oil production was down by three percent to a
1973 level of 316 million barrels, the report said.
Natural gas was down by 10 percent to 487
billion cubic feet, the report added.
Today's Weather
Chance of showers this morning then partly
cloudy this afternoon through tomorrow. Lows
tonight in upper 30s to low 40s. Highs both days in
50s. Southerly wind west to northwest 10 to 20
mph today. Chance of rain 40 percent today.

flames. The flight carried 91 passengers and a crew
of 10, including 35 Americans. The time was eight
minutes before midnight in Samoa, Wednesday
(3:52 a.m. PDT yesterday).
Most passengers were believed to be from New
Zealand and Western Samoa.
Pago Pago is on one of the seven islands of
American Samoa in the mid-Pacific. It lies a little
over a third of the way between New Zealand and
the Hawaiian Islands.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was
in contact with aviation authorities in the South
Pacific but had no information on the crash other
than what already had been reported.
The crash was the third involving a Pan American
jetliner in the past seven months.
Panel Seeks Subpoena Power
WASHINGTON — A unanimous House Judiciary
Committee voted yesterday to seek broad authority
to subpoena White House documents and witnesses
for its impeachment inquiry.
By voice vote, the 21 Democrats and 16
Republicans on the committee approved a
resolution that would confer on it full authority to
conduct the investigation and to get complete access
to any information it needs.
Approval by the full House is expected Tuesday,

setting the stage for a possible confrontation
between the committee and President Nixon.
The committee was advised by special counsel
John M. Doar that the House had unqualified
subpoena powers under the Constitution in
impeachment investigations.
Terrorists Firebomb Oil Tank
SINGAPORE — Four men set fire to a Shell oil
storage tank here yesterday, then seized five
hostages aboard a ferry and threatened to kill
themselves and the hostages unless they got safe
conduct to an Arab country, officials said.
The Singapore government said it would meet
the terrorists' conditions. The four demanded a
plane and asked to trade their hostages for the
Japanese ambassador and his secretary.
But yesterday morning the 80-foot ferry Laju
still sat in Singapore harbor, surrounded by at least
15 police patrol boats and navy gunboats, awaiting
arrival of a plane to take the four terrorists to the
Middle East.
A Japan Air Lines plan? delayed in Bangkok,
Thailand, was thought to be ready to fly to
Singapore to pick up the terrorists, but the airline
said later that the plane had returned to Tokyo.
The Japanese ambassador, Okichiro Uomoto,
who was taking part in the negotiations, described
the four terrorists as "polite and well-educated."
In Beirut, Lebanon, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for
the attack.
A statement said the operation was staged by
Palestinian guerrillas and members of the Japanese
Red Army in retaliation for the "aggressive role of
oil companies and the government of Singapore
against the Arab people in general and the
Palestinian people in particular."
'Evidence Supports Dean Story'
WASHINGTON — An assistant special Watergate
prosecutor says the government has no evidence to
prove that presidential accuser John W. Dean 111 lied
under oath. "Based on the evidence we have
accumulated so far we have no reason for believing
that Mr. Dean has committed perjury in any
proceeding," Richard Davis said in federal court. It
was the first statement from the office of Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski directly contradicting
Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., who says the White House
has evidence that Dean lied.
Scott was unavailable for comment.
Dean has told the Senate Watergate committee
that he left a meeting with President Nixon Sept.
15, 1972, feeling that the President was aware "of
what had been going on regarding the success of
keeping the White House out of the Watergate
scandal."
A tape recording of that meeting is in the hands
of the prosecutors and grand jury.
Dean also swore the President said Watergate
defendant E. Howard Hunt had been promised
executive clemency and that paying hush money
was no problem. Nixon denied making the
statements.
Meanwhile, the prosecutors who have handled
the Watergate cover-up investigation and White
House lawyers met yesterday with Chief U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica. The subject discussed
at the 45-minute gathering was not disclosed, and
the transcript was sealed.
Th ree Murdered In Oakland
OAKLAND — The hacked and stabbed bodies of
three mortuary employees were discovered in a
blood-spattered funeral home yesterday — one of
them sprawled in the chapel among knocked-over
pews.

Police said one of the victims was a Vietnam
veteran who put up a terrific struggle before he was
killed.
Deputy Police Chief Tom Donahue said there
was nothing to connect this latest multiple slaying
to a random shooting spree in San Francisco
Monday night in which four persons were shot dead.
Police said it appeared the only things missing in
the mortuary killings were several pints of
embalming fluid. One of them was shattered on a
sidewalk near the Albert Brown Mortuary.
Senate To Probe Alleged Spying
WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed Services
Committee voted yesterday to investigate alleged
high-level military spying on Henry A. Kissinger
which was uncovered by the White House plumbers
operation during their investigation of news leaks.
Chairman John C. Stennis, D-Miss., said the
committee decided at a closed session to ask
Kissinger and Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to testify on the matter
next week.
"After they have been heard the committee will
decide what further steps to take," Stennis said.
Stennis said he has spent much of his time in
recent weeks looking into reports that certain
national security documents were transmitted
without authority from the National Security
Council headed by Kissinger to Moorer's office at
the Pentagon.
A 1971 White House investigation of news leaks
turned up evidence that White House military aides
were passing unauthorized information about
National Security Council proceedings to the
Pentagon.
The Pentagon has said overzealousness by the
aides was responsible for the action but denied
national security was threatened.
Soldiers Terrorize Viet Refugees
SAIGON — Local authorities and landowners are
paying soldiers to terrorize refugees and drive them
away from resettlement homesites wanted by land
speculators, South Vietnamese officials said
yesterday.
The officials' comments, in reply to a reporter's
questions, came after a raid on a resettlement area
Monday where soldiers killed an old woman and
wounded several other refugees.
A Buddhist leader said the refugees told him they
were attacked by three unidentified men firing
grenade launchers and rifles. Someone returned later
and replaced the empty cartridges from the
American-made weapons with empty shells from the
kind of weapons carried by the Viet Cong.
One government official, who asked not to be
identified, said such acts sometimes are "instigated
by a corrupt mili ry commander, sometimes by a
regional tycoon, sometimes by a Catholic priest who
hates Buddhists." Many refugees are Buddhists.
State Oil, Gas Production Down
SACRAMENTO — California's oil and natural gas
production continued to shrink considerably in

1973 level of 316 million barrels, the report said.
Natural gas was down by 10 percent to 487
billion cubic feet, the report added.

92 Die In Pan Am Jet Crash
NEW YORK — A Pan American World Airways
707 jetliner crashed and bumed on a landing
approach at Pago Pago, Samoa, yesterday and 92 of
the 101 persons aboard died, the airline said.
Pan American said 10 survivors were pulled from
the wreckage. But one of them, Joan Merrill, 52, of
Altaloma, Calif., died later in a hospital. Her
husband, Maury, 54, was among the hospitalized.
His condition was not known, a Pan Am spokesman
said.

Panel Seeks Subpoena Power
WASHINGTON — A unanimous House Judiciary
Committee voted yesterday to seek broad authority
to subpoena White House documents and witnesses
for its impeachment inquiry.
By voice vote, the 21 Democrats and 16
Republicans on the committee approved a
resolution that would confer on it full authority to
conduct the investigation and to get complete access
to any information it needs.
Approval by the full House is expected Tuesday,

setting the stage for a possible confrontation
between the committee and President Nixon.
The committee was advised by special counsel
John M. Doar that the House had unqualified
subpoena powers under the Constitution in
impeachment investigations.
Terrorists Firebomb Oil Tank
SINGAPORE — Four men set fire to a Shell oil
storage tank here yesterday, then seized five
hostages aboard a ferry and threatened to kill
themselves and the hostages unless they got safe
conduct to an Arab country, officials said.
The Singapore government said it would meet
the terrorists' conditions. The four demanded a
plane and asked to trade their hostages for the
Japanese ambassador and his secretary.
But yesterday morning the 80-foot ferry Laju
still sat in Singapore harbor, surrounded by at least
15 police patrol boats and navy gunboats, awaiting
arrival of a plane to take the four terrorists to the
Middle East.
A Japan Air Lines plan? delayed in Bangkok,
Thailand, was thought to be ready to fly to
Singapore to pick up the terrorists, but the airline
said later that the plane had returned to Tokyo.
The Japanese ambassador, Okichiro Uomoto,
who was taking part in the negotiations, described
the four terrorists as "polite and well-educated."
In Beirut, Lebanon, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for
the attack.
A statement said the operation was staged by
Palestinian guerrillas and members of the Japanese
Red Army in retaliation for the "aggressive role of
oil companies and the government of Singapore
against the Arab people in general and the
Palestinian people in particular."
'Evidence Supports Dean Story'
WASHINGTON — An assistant special Watergate
prosecutor says the government has no evidence to
prove that presidential accuser John W. Dean 111 lied
under oath. "Based on the evidence we have
accumulated so far we have no reason for believing
that Mr. Dean has committed perjury in any
proceeding," Richard Davis said in federal court. It
was the first statement from the office of Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski directly contradicting
Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., who says the White House
has evidence that Dean lied.
Scott was unavailable for comment.
Dean has told the Senate Watergate committee
that he left a meeting with President Nixon Sept.
15, 1972, feeling that the President was aware "of
what had been going on regarding the success of
keeping the White House out of the Watergate
scandal."
A tape recording of that meeting is in the hands
of the prosecutors and grand jury.
Dean also swore the President said Watergate
defendant E. Howard Hunt had been promised
executive clemency and that paying hush money
was no problem. Nixon denied making the
statements.
Meanwhile, the prosecutors who have handled
the Watergate cover-up investigation and White
House lawyers met yesterday with Chief U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica. The subject discussed
at the 45-minute gathering was not disclosed, and
the transcript was sealed.
Th ree Murdered In Oakland
OAKLAND — The hacked and stabbed bodies of
three mortuary employees were discovered in a
blood-spattered funeral home yesterday — one of
them sprawled in the chapel among knocked-over
pews.

Police said one of the victims was a Vietnam
veteran who put up a terrific struggle before he was
killed.
Deputy Police Chief Tom Donahue said there
was nothing to connect this latest multiple slaying
to a random shooting spree in San Francisco
Monday night in which four persons were shot dead.
Police said it appeared the only things missing in
the mortuary killings were several pints of
embalming fluid. One of them was shattered on a
sidewalk near the Albert Brown Mortuary.
Senate To Probe Alleged Spying
WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed Services
Committee voted yesterday to investigate alleged
high-level military spying on Henry A. Kissinger
which was uncovered by the White House plumbers
operation during their investigation of news leaks.
Chairman John C. Stennis, D-Miss., said the
committee decided at a closed session to ask
Kissinger and Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to testify on the matter
next week.
"After they have been heard the committee will
decide what further steps to take," Stennis said.
Stennis said he has spent much of his time in
recent weeks looking into reports that certain
national security documents were transmitted
without authority from the National Security
Council headed by Kissinger to Moorer's office at
the Pentagon.
A 1971 White House investigation of news leaks
turned up evidence that White House military aides
were passing unauthorized information about
National Security Council proceedings to the
Pentagon.
The Pentagon has said overzealousness by the
aides was responsible for the action but denied
national security was threatened.
Soldiers Terrorize Viet Refugees
SAIGON — Local authorities and landowners are
paying soldiers to terrorize refugees and drive them
away from resettlement homesites wanted by land
speculators, South Vietnamese officials said
yesterday.
The officials' comments, in reply to a reporter's
questions, came after a raid on a resettlement area
Monday where soldiers killed an old woman and
wounded several other refugees.
A Buddhist leader said the refugees told him they
were attacked by three unidentified men firing
grenade launchers and rifles. Someone returned later
and replaced the empty cartridges from the
American-made weapons with empty shells from the
kind of weapons carried by the Viet Cong.
One government official, who asked not to be
identified, said such acts sometimes are "instigated
by a corrupt mili ry commander, sometimes by a
regional tycoon, sometimes by a Catholic priest who
hates Buddhists." Many refugees are Buddhists.
State Oil, Gas Production Down
SACRAMENTO — California's oil and natural gas
production continued to shrink considerably in
1973, the state Division of Oil and Gas said in a
report yesterday.
Oil production was down by three percent to a
1973 level of 316 million barrels, the report said.
Natural gas was down by 10 percent to 487
billion cubic feet, the report added.
Today's Weather
Chance of showers this morning then partly

92 Die In Pan Am Jet Crash
NEW YORK — A Pan American World Airways
707 jetliner crashed and bumed on a landing
approach at Pago Pago, Samoa, yesterday and 92 of
the 101 persons aboard died, the airline said.
Pan American said 10 survivors were pulled from
the wreckage. But one of them, Joan Merrill, 52, of
Altaloma, Calif., died later in a hospital. Her
husband, Maury, 54, was among the hospitalized.
His condition was not known, a Pan Am spokesman
said.
He said the plane went down 1000 yards short of
the runway during heavy rain squalls and burst into
flames. The flight carried 91 passengers and a crew
of 10, including 35 Americans. The time was eight
minutes before midnight in Samoa, Wednesday
(3:52 a.m. PDT yesterday).
Most passengers were believed to be from New
Zealand and Western Samoa.
Pago Pago is on one of the seven islands of
American Samoa in the mid-Pacific. It lies a little
over a third of the way between New Zealand and
the Hawaiian Islands.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was
in contact with aviation authorities in the South
Pacific but had no information on the crash other
than what already had been reported.
The crash was the third involving a Pan American

subpoena powers under the Constitution in
impeachment investigations.
Terrorists Firebomb Oil Tank
SINGAPORE — Four men set fire to a Shell oil
storage tank here yesterday, then seized five
hostages aboard a ferry and threatened to kill
themselves and the hostages unless they got safe
conduct to an Arab country, officials said.
The Singapore government said it would meet
the terrorists' conditions. The four demanded a
plane and asked to trade their hostages for the
Japanese ambassador and his secretary.
But yesterday morning the 80-foot ferry Laju
still sat in Singapore harbor, surrounded by at least
15 police patrol boats and navy gunboats, awaiting
arrival of a plane to take the four terrorists to the
Middle East.
A Japan Air Lines plan? delayed in Bangkok,
Thailand, was thought to be ready to fly to
Singapore to pick up the terrorists, but the airline
said later that the plane had returned to Tokyo.
The Japanese ambassador, Okichiro Uomoto,
who was taking part in the negotiations, described
the four terrorists as "polite and well-educated."
In Beirut, Lebanon, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for
the attack.
A statement said the operation was staged by
Palestinian guerrillas and members of the Japanese
Red Army in retaliation for the "aggressive role of
oil companies and the government of Singapore
against the Arab people in general and the
Palestinian people in particular."
'Evidence Supports Dean Story'
WASHINGTON — An assistant special Watergate
prosecutor says the government has no evidence to
prove that presidential accuser John W. Dean 111 lied
under oath. "Based on the evidence we have
accumulated so far we have no reason for believing
that Mr. Dean has committed perjury in any
proceeding," Richard Davis said in federal court. It
was the first statement from the office of Special
Prosecutor Leon Jaworski directly contradicting
Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., who says the White House
has evidence that Dean lied.
Scott was unavailable for comment.
Dean has told the Senate Watergate committee
that he left a meeting with President Nixon Sept.
15, 1972, feeling that the President was aware "of
what had been going on regarding the success of
keeping the White House out of the Watergate
scandal."
A tape recording of that meeting is in the hands
of the prosecutors and grand jury.
Dean also swore the President said Watergate
defendant E. Howard Hunt had been promised
executive clemency and that paying hush money
was no problem. Nixon denied making the
statements.
Meanwhile, the prosecutors who have handled
the Watergate cover-up investigation and White
House lawyers met yesterday with Chief U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica. The subject discussed
at the 45-minute gathering was not disclosed, and
the transcript was sealed.
Th ree Murdered In Oakland
OAKLAND — The hacked and stabbed bodies of
three mortuary employees were discovered in a
blood-spattered funeral home yesterday — one of
them sprawled in the chapel among knocked-over
pews.

Police said one of the victims was a Vietnam
veteran who put up a terrific struggle before he was
killed.
Deputy Police Chief Tom Donahue said there
was nothing to connect this latest multiple slaying
to a random shooting spree in San Francisco
Monday night in which four persons were shot dead.
Police said it appeared the only things missing in
the mortuary killings were several pints of
embalming fluid. One of them was shattered on a
sidewalk near the Albert Brown Mortuary.
Senate To Probe Alleged Spying
WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed Services
Committee voted yesterday to investigate alleged
high-level military spying on Henry A. Kissinger
which was uncovered by the White House plumbers
operation during their investigation of news leaks.
Chairman John C. Stennis, D-Miss., said the
committee decided at a closed session to ask
Kissinger and Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to testify on the matter
next week.
"After they have been heard the committee will
decide what further steps to take," Stennis said.
Stennis said he has spent much of his time in
recent weeks looking into reports that certain
national security documents were transmitted
without authority from the National Security
Council headed by Kissinger to Moorer's office at
the Pentagon.
A 1971 White House investigation of news leaks
turned up evidence that White House military aides
were passing unauthorized information about
National Security Council proceedings to the
Pentagon.
The Pentagon has said overzealousness by the
aides was responsible for the action but denied
national security was threatened.
Soldiers Terrorize Viet Refugees
SAIGON — Local authorities and landowners are
paying soldiers to terrorize refugees and drive them
away from resettlement homesites wanted by land
speculators, South Vietnamese officials said
yesterday.
The officials' comments, in reply to a reporter's
questions, came after a raid on a resettlement area
Monday where soldiers killed an old woman and
wounded several other refugees.
A Buddhist leader said the refugees told him they
were attacked by three unidentified men firing
grenade launchers and rifles. Someone returned later
and replaced the empty cartridges from the
American-made weapons with empty shells from the
kind of weapons carried by the Viet Cong.
One government official, who asked not to be
identified, said such acts sometimes are "instigated
by a corrupt mili ry commander, sometimes by a
regional tycoon, sometimes by a Catholic priest who
hates Buddhists." Many refugees are Buddhists.
State Oil, Gas Production Down
SACRAMENTO — California's oil and natural gas
production continued to shrink considerably in
1973, the state Division of Oil and Gas said in a
report yesterday.
Oil production was down by three percent to a
1973 level of 316 million barrels, the report said.
Natural gas was down by 10 percent to 487
billion cubic feet, the report added.
Today's Weather

92 Die In Pan Am Jet Crash
NEW YORK — A Pan American World Airways
707 jetliner crashed and bumed on a landing
approach at Pago Pago, Samoa, yesterday and 92 of
the 101 persons aboard died, the airline said.
Pan American said 10 survivors were pulled from
the wreckage. But one of them, Joan Merrill, 52, of
Altaloma, Calif., died later in a hospital. Her
husband, Maury, 54, was among the hospitalized.
His condition was not known, a Pan Am spokesman
said.
He said the plane went down 1000 yards short of
the runway during heavy rain squalls and burst into
flames. The flight carried 91 passengers and a crew
of 10, including 35 Americans. The time was eight
minutes before midnight in Samoa, Wednesday
(3:52 a.m. PDT yesterday).
Most passengers were believed to be from New
Zealand and Western Samoa.
Pago Pago is on one of the seven islands of
American Samoa in the mid-Pacific. It lies a little
over a third of the way between New Zealand and
the Hawaiian Islands.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was
in contact with aviation authorities in the South
Pacific but had no information on the crash other
than what already had been reported.
The crash was the third involving a Pan American
jetliner in the past seven months.
Panel Seeks Subpoena Power
WASHINGTON — A unanimous House Judiciary
Committee voted yesterday to seek broad authority
to subpoena White House documents and witnesses
for its impeachment inquiry.
By voice vote, the 21 Democrats and 16
Republicans on the committee approved a
resolution that would confer on it full authority to
conduct the investigation and to get complete access
to any information it needs.
Approval by the full House is expected Tuesday,

setting the stage for a possible confrontation
between the committee and President Nixon.
The committee was advised by special counsel
John M. Doar that the House had unqualified
subpoena powers under the Constitution in
impeachment investigations.
