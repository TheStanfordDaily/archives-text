# USE Gathers For Strike Talk
## 
### 
The United Stanford Employees Union
(USE) will hold a strike workshop tomorrow
| at 1 p.m. in Bishop Auditorium to discuss the
| dynamics of organizing and implementing a
| strike, should the need arise.
| Contrary to the beliefs of some union
| members, the purpose of the meeting is not
| to hold an actual strike vote said Jim Berk,
USE president.
The USE is presently conducting
| negotiations with the University for a new
contract. Doug Barton, head of the
University negotiating team, had said last
month that the union's and the University's
positions were "miles apart."
"We plan to educate members on how,
when and why a strike is carried off and to
get people prepared to answer the practical
questions involved in a strike," said Berk.
"Although we're closer to a strike than
before," Berk said it was too early to strike
$ on any particular contract issue.
The meeting is also designed to be a show
of force by the union for its negotiating
\ position.
Coordinators from previous Bay Area
strikes will be present to offer suggestions
and assistance.
