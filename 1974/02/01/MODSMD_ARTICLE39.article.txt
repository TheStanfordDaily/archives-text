# Black Scientists Plan Technology Meeting
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
The Society of Black Scientists and
Engineers (SBSE) will sponsor their
first major public event, a symposium
on science and technology, tomorrow
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Registration
for the conference, which is titled
"Knowledge and Power," will be at
Tresidder Union.
Among those scheduled to address
the conference are State Sen. Mervyn
Dymally, Howard University
Engineering Dean Percy Pierre and the
Rev. Heziah Williams, director of the
Center for Black Studies at Berkeley.
All the speeches will be at Cubberley
Auditorium.
In addition to the speeches, six
workshops will be held in the early
afternoon to allow black high school
and junior high school students a
chance to talk with graduate
engineering and science students and
executives from a number of industrial
corporations.
Earth sciences senior N. Robert
Anderson, one of the symposium's
organizers, said that the response from
both industry and local schools was
much better than expected. He said
that up to 600 people may attend,
whereas SBSE had only expected 300
when the conference was originally
publicized.
SBSE member Ken Perry, a
bio-medical engineering grad student,
said that the primary goal of the
symposium will be to show young
blacks that "it is possible and it is

needed to go into science and
engineering."
"Technology is power," Perry said.
"Blacks must learn to use technology
for their own advantage. You can't
eliminate slums or provide better
health care with just politicians and
sociologists."
According to engineering grad
student Ron Fleming, another of
SBSE's organizers, blacks constitute
only one percent of all the scientists
and engineers in the United States. He
said that part of the problem, aside
from racial discrimination, is that
black youngsters are put off by the
"mystique" of the hard sciences.
"Science and technology are so
foreign to the average inner city
black," Fleming said. "They have no
way of relating to it." Fleming hopes
that the conference will lead to further
contacts between Stanford students
and their school-page counterparts so
that the "mystique" could be
explained away. Nevertheless, he
admitted that it was often difficult to
explain the relevance of the hard
sciences to ghetto youths.
SBSE had originally scheduled this
symposium for Nov. 26 of last year,
but financial difficulties and the
murder of Oakland school chief
Marcus Foster, the scheduled keynote
speaker, forced a postponement until
now.
