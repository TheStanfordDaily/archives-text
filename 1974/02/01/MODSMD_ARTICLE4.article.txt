# Student Lives After Plunge From Bridge
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
A Stanford student fell
approximately 190 feet from the
Golden Gate Bridge yesterday — and
lived.
John W. Adams, 21, a junior
majoring in history from Eugene, Ore.,
apparently jumped from the northern
end of the bridge and landed on a
rain-softened sandy slope, the
California Highway Patrol said.
Adams was reported in "very good
condition" yesterday at Mission
Emergency Hospital in San Francisco.
He suffered a separated collar bone
and a possible fracture of the shoulder
blade, according to hospital
spokesmen.
"He is the miracle of the year,"
Edith Ross, assistant hospital nursing
director siad. "He's doing just fine;
he's awake and alert."
Adams was held at the hospital
last night for further examination and
refused to talk to newsmen.
Highway Patrol Officer George
Haley told the Daily Adams had
parked his car at Vista Point, near the
Marin County end of the bridge, and
was observed walking on the eastern
side of the structure by a bridge
engineer. The engineer called police.
"The engineer said the guy looked
suspicious, up by the rail, starting to
lean over," Haley said. "But when I
got there, he was gone. When I looked
down over the bridge, I saw him laying
on the rocks on his back.
"He apparently landed on a sandy
area and rolled onto the rocks," Haley
explained. The officer joined bridge
employees at the foot of the bridge to
assist in Adams' rescue.
But "he had already gotten up and
was walking toward us," Haley said.
"He was in a pretty dazed state and
didn't seem to know how he had
gotten there."
Adams had left a note in his car
saying he intended to jump and take
his own life, patrol officials said.
"He had taken some medicine, a
depressant," Haley added. "He must
have been completely relaxed when he
h't. That's what probably saved him."
More than 500 people have leaped
to their death from the Golden Gate
Bridge — over 100 in the past three
years. Less than a dozen people have
jumped and survived in the bridge's
33-year history.

assist in Adams' rescue.
But "he had already gotten up and
was walking toward us," Haley said.
"He was in a pretty dazed state and
didn't seem to know how he had
gotten there."
Adams had left a note in his car
saying he intended to jump and take
his own life, patrol officials said.
"He had taken some medicine, a
depressant," Haley added. "He must
have been completely relaxed when he
h't. That's what probably saved him."
More than 500 people have leaped
to their death from the Golden Gate
Bridge — over 100 in the past three
years. Less than a dozen people have
jumped and survived in the bridge's
33-year history.
