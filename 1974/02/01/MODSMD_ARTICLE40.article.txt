# Econ Meeting
## 
### 
Assoc. Economics Prof. Duncan K.
Foley has announced an open meeting
for today to consider the lack of
radical political economics instructors
on the department faculty.
The meeting, called at the request
of Economics Department Chairman
Moses Abramovitz, will be held in
Tresidder 270-271 at 2:30 p.m.
According to a statement issued by
Foley, the meeting will open with two
or three brief presentations urging
more classes offering "Marxian and
radical analysis." The presentations
will be followed by an open
discussion.
A letter to Abramovitz last
December, signer? by 208
undergraduates, expressed concern
that such analyses were lacking, and
urged that the department "fulfill this
responsibility" to offer "instruction in
all schools of economic thought."
The situation was brought to a head
with the planned departure of visiting
Prof. Donald Harris and the scheduled
leave of Prof. John Gurley, the
department's only Marxian professors.
