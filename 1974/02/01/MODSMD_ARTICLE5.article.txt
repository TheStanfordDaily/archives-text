# Women Exert More Influence In Faculty Senate
## 
### WENDY QUINONES 
Ten women now sit on the Faculty
Senate, a dramatic increase over the
two who sensed last year. But has this
highly visible change affected actual
Senate operations? Do the new
senators see themselves specifically as
women's representatives? Have they
organized as a caucus with this in
mind?
"There's been no need as yet to get
together as a caucus," says Ann Snow,
assistant professor of German and one
of hast year's two women senators. No
issues particularly relevant to women
have come before the current Senate,
she says.
She expects collective action on
future issues, but she and the other
women approach mobilization with
some caution. Psychology Prof.
Eleanor Maccoby, who won her
second Senate term in last spring's
election, says collective action would
be desirable only if it supported a
good policy.
Eve Clark, an assistant professor of
linguistics serving her first Senate
term, agrees. "Any collective action
would have to depend on the issue
involved," she says. "It's not
incumbent on us to act as a group."
Most of the women, like Clark,
have served only the first quarter of a
two-year term, so it may be still too
early to expect any major impact on

Senate operations. But according to
Snow and Maccoby, their presence has
already influenced the Senate in some
subtle ways.
"There are no male in-jokes," says
Snow, "and business can't be carried
out as though it were a male club.
People are more aware of the need to
speak to a constituency of women."
She and Maccoby also agree that
while one or two women serving alone
might be seen as what Snow calls

"radical women's liberationists,"
always representing a woman's
viewpoint, 10 women are more likely
to be seen as individuals with differing
points of view.
Some male senators have noticed
recent changes in the Senate.
Aerophysics Prof. Daniel Bershader, a
former Senate chairman, says the
presence of more women has led to "a
more animated discussion of many
issues."
Bershader says the women
"represent a segment of the faculty
which has not held senior positions on
committees or in departmental
administration. They can take a fresh
look at some University structures and
traditions."
But last year's Senate Chairman,
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden, says inexperience may
not be so beneficial. "The Senate has
deteriorated this year," he says,
"because there are too many new
members," both women and men. As a
result, Royden says, the Senate spends
"too much time on trifles."
This charge is echoed by several of
the women. Prof. Jean Franco,
chairwoman of the Spanish and
Portuguese Department, says the
Senate doesn't deal with fundamental
problems such as the student adviser
system. "Issues are always translated
into discussions of procedure," says

Franco, and the women's unfamiliarity
with procedure limits their
participation. "It's like "an elaborate
game, and we have yet to learn the
rules," she says.
Sandra Bern, an assistant professor
of psychology, agrees, "I'm still
listening to learn what sorts of
comments are appropriate when." This
disorientation is shared by almost all
the new women senators. Most say,
however, that their participation will
increase as they grow more familiar
with the Senate.
If power politics have been absent
from the women's actions on the
Senate, they were also absent from last
spring's election. In their only
campaign move, the University
Women's Caucus, organized by Snow,
and Professional Women in the
Medical School (PWSMS) sent letters
to voting faculty urging them to elect
the women in their constituencies.
Competition for Senate seats is so
low-keyed that this low-profile
strategy was successful in giving
women almost 20 percent of the
Senate's 53 seats, despite their holding
only eight percent of regular faculty
appointments. Since men cast most of
the ballots, "there was a lot of good
will," Snow explains.
Humanities Prof. William Clebsch,
another former Senate chairman, is
concerned that the large percentage of

women on the Senate might soften its
handling of affirmative action issues.
The women senators, however, see
little chance that this will happen.
Most say that affirmative action is one
of their most important reasons for
being on the Senate. For some like
Bern — who views her role there as a
watchdog for decisions affecting
women — it is almost the only reason.
"I'm not as interested in other issues,"
she explains.

And it is over the affirmative action
issues that the women expect they will
get together for some collective action.
"It's high time," states Maccoby.
"When there's been discrimination, as
I think there has been in hiring at this
University in the past, it's high time
that we should join together."
Snow expects an upcoming report
to provide a focus for organization
among the women senators. The ad
hoc Senate Committee on the
Professoriate was established two years
ago, according to Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbigler, to look into
procedures and policies for faculty
appointments at all levels, and the
conditions and terms of faculty
employment.
Snow and several of the other
women expect to have different
priorities than the rest of the Senate
for action on this report. Last year the
Women's Caucus made a number of
recommendations to the committee
aimed at improving the status of
para-faculty — lecturers, instructors,
research associates and similar faculty
members — who are largely women,
and whose appointments do not
entitle them to vote in the Senate
elections.
Whether these recommendations
will be seriously considered by the
Senate, says Snow, remains to be seen.
