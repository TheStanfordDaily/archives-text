## Reflections 
### 
Today is my last day as editor of the Daily. This column is a
thank you note as well as an informal semi-annual report to Stanford
University.
During the last four months, I have lived the dream of many an
aspiring Daily staff member. The experience has been rewarding to
me and, I hope, to the readership of the Daily. There have been the
usual disappointments and unfulfilled hopes, but the long strides we
have made elsewhere more than compensate for these setbacks.
This has been the second successful year for the Daily's football
issues, which have strengthened the newspaper's financial position
and provided a valuable and appreciated service to tens of thousands
of Card football fans at each home game.
In cooperation with the Athletic Department, the Daily is now
distributing free, tabloid-sized editions at each home basketball
game. The basketball issues have proved to be financially viable even
though this is the first year we have published them.
The Daily owes the financial success of the football and basketball
editions to ad salesmen Lee Hanley and Newell LaVoy, and has Dave
Robinson and Viae Kershner to thank for their excellent editorial
quality.
The Daily's news department has continued to provide what I
view as comprehensive coverage of Palo Alto civic affairs and official
academic proceedings. I am happy to say that frequent, lively feature
stories have also returned to the pages of the Daily.
Unfortunately, we remain unable to give adequate attention to
University staff news, and we would welcome any suggestions staff
members have about improving our coverage.
The main disappointment of my term as editor has been the
realization that the Daily will not be as financially sound as had been
predicted by past editors and business managers. It is probable that
we will have to ask the University to continue compensating us for
faculty and staff "subscriptions." Student fee assessments are at least
conceivable.
I commend Business Manager Mike Kruger for taking the initiative
to reexamine the three-year-old "land of plenty" projections of the
Daily's financial outlook and for warning us long before drastic
action became necessary.
Each person who has served as a news, entertainment, sports,
features, opinions, staff or photography editor during the last four
months has earned the gratitude of each of our readers for selflessly
giving his or her time to the production of the paper. Their
dedication and energy have made the Daily as good as it is, and will
make it better in the days to come.
There is one person, however, who is more responsible than
anyone else for the success of this volume. Stan Wilson has served as
managing editor of the Daily throughout my term and I believe he
has done a superlative job of combining technical skill with a
charismatic manner of dealing with people, both on and off the staff.
To Stan I owe a debt that I can never fully repay.
Rich Jaroslovsky, who takes over as editor Monday, has served the
Daily well and will continue to do so over the next four months. If
his volume is as rewarding and productive as mine has been, both he
and the Daily's readers are in for a real treat.

of Card football fans at each home game.
In cooperation with the Athletic Department, the Daily is now
distributing free, tabloid-sized editions at each home basketball
game. The basketball issues have proved to be financially viable even
though this is the first year we have published them.
The Daily owes the financial success of the football and basketball
editions to ad salesmen Lee Hanley and Newell LaVoy, and has Dave
Robinson and Viae Kershner to thank for their excellent editorial
quality.
The Daily's news department has continued to provide what I
view as comprehensive coverage of Palo Alto civic affairs and official
academic proceedings. I am happy to say that frequent, lively feature
stories have also returned to the pages of the Daily.
Unfortunately, we remain unable to give adequate attention to
University staff news, and we would welcome any suggestions staff
members have about improving our coverage.
The main disappointment of my term as editor has been the
realization that the Daily will not be as financially sound as had been
predicted by past editors and business managers. It is probable that
we will have to ask the University to continue compensating us for
faculty and staff "subscriptions." Student fee assessments are at least
conceivable.
I commend Business Manager Mike Kruger for taking the initiative
to reexamine the three-year-old "land of plenty" projections of the
Daily's financial outlook and for warning us long before drastic
action became necessary.
Each person who has served as a news, entertainment, sports,
features, opinions, staff or photography editor during the last four
months has earned the gratitude of each of our readers for selflessly
giving his or her time to the production of the paper. Their
dedication and energy have made the Daily as good as it is, and will
make it better in the days to come.
There is one person, however, who is more responsible than
anyone else for the success of this volume. Stan Wilson has served as
managing editor of the Daily throughout my term and I believe he
has done a superlative job of combining technical skill with a
charismatic manner of dealing with people, both on and off the staff.
To Stan I owe a debt that I can never fully repay.
Rich Jaroslovsky, who takes over as editor Monday, has served the
Daily well and will continue to do so over the next four months. If
his volume is as rewarding and productive as mine has been, both he
and the Daily's readers are in for a real treat.

Today is my last day as editor of the Daily. This column is a
thank you note as well as an informal semi-annual report to Stanford
University.
During the last four months, I have lived the dream of many an
aspiring Daily staff member. The experience has been rewarding to
me and, I hope, to the readership of the Daily. There have been the
usual disappointments and unfulfilled hopes, but the long strides we
have made elsewhere more than compensate for these setbacks.
This has been the second successful year for the Daily's football
issues, which have strengthened the newspaper's financial position
and provided a valuable and appreciated service to tens of thousands
of Card football fans at each home game.
