# Get Away From It All
## Places To Hide 
### 
Doug Witkins

"I want to be alone!" Ever since
Greta Garbo popularized the phrase,
men and women have yearned to be
by themselves. The pressures of a large
university demand one's periodic
separation from other humans — even
if for a very short time. There are
countless spots on campus, which
serve to hide the budding hermit from
his peers.
The best known are Lake Lagunita,
Frost Amphitheatre, Memorial
Church, the museum and the
mausoleum. All these share a sense of
beauty, or, in the case of the
mausoleum, a sense of mystery. They
are not original in any sense, however.
What good is a special "mood" place,
if everyone else comes there for the
same reason? The trick is to find a
lonely place where you can be moody
by yourself.
Take the Main Library stacks, for
example. God only knows how many
students have dropped dead and
completely decomposed there without
being noticed. If a pin dropped in this
castle of carrels, the thundering blast
would no doubt knock some
nearsighted librarian into an early
grave. Since perfect solitude carries
with it a high risk of being forgotten
indefinitely, a more realistic suggestion
might be the Tresidder Coffee House.
The Coffee House offers a warm,
almost stuffy atmosphere complete
with the pungent aroma from Winston,
Marlboro and Salem addicts. Some
nights the house is quite crowded, but
the same people don't stay for long,
especially if they happen to sample
one of those Italian sodas during their
visit.
Cozy 'Sleep and Dreams'
Being lost in a crowd is sometimes
just as effective as complete isolation.
This sensation is experienced by

enrolling in "Sleep and Dreams." This
cozy class of 750 will effectively
smother you from any outside
agitation.
If you really want to be ignored, go
to the Student Accounts Office and
ask for your scholarship money. This
gives you that incomparable feeling of
looking like thin air.
Now that we've outlined places to
go, the thought arises that there must
be some places not to go for solitude.
First on this list is your own room.
Everyone in the world knows where
you live, what your phone number is
and when you can be reached. Avoid
your room like the mumps.
Solitude In The John?
When you lived at home, you might
have considered the john an escape
from people. Not so, here. The dorm
lavatory is unequivocably the social
center of the corridor. All day long,
you can find people discussing, singing
or screaming in the john.
Another spot to avoid is Meyer
Library. It's seldom quiet enough for
studying, let alone introspection.
Meyer is the hang-out of goony, giggly,
freshman girls; stay clear!
Don't ever find yourself in the
Math or Physics building. Some totally
bewidlered student will immediately
think you are a TA come to save him,
and you'll never get him off your
back.
Unquestionably, though, the most
dangerous place of all is anywhere
within one block of the Stanford Daily
Offices. It's frightening how many idle
people have been yanked in off the
street to help put together this paper.
If you like being thoughtful, or
blissfully bored, by all means, keep
away from the Storke Student
Publications Building.

Cozy 'Sleep and Dreams'
Being lost in a crowd is sometimes
just as effective as complete isolation.
This sensation is experienced by

enrolling in "Sleep and Dreams." This
cozy class of 750 will effectively
smother you from any outside
agitation.
If you really want to be ignored, go
to the Student Accounts Office and
ask for your scholarship money. This
gives you that incomparable feeling of
looking like thin air.
Now that we've outlined places to
go, the thought arises that there must
be some places not to go for solitude.
First on this list is your own room.
Everyone in the world knows where
you live, what your phone number is
and when you can be reached. Avoid
your room like the mumps.
Solitude In The John?
When you lived at home, you might
have considered the john an escape
from people. Not so, here. The dorm
lavatory is unequivocably the social
center of the corridor. All day long,
you can find people discussing, singing
or screaming in the john.
Another spot to avoid is Meyer
Library. It's seldom quiet enough for
studying, let alone introspection.
Meyer is the hang-out of goony, giggly,
freshman girls; stay clear!
Don't ever find yourself in the
Math or Physics building. Some totally
bewidlered student will immediately
think you are a TA come to save him,
and you'll never get him off your
back.
Unquestionably, though, the most
dangerous place of all is anywhere
within one block of the Stanford Daily
Offices. It's frightening how many idle
people have been yanked in off the
street to help put together this paper.
If you like being thoughtful, or
blissfully bored, by all means, keep
away from the Storke Student
Publications Building.

"I want to be alone!" Ever since
Greta Garbo popularized the phrase,
men and women have yearned to be
by themselves. The pressures of a large
university demand one's periodic
separation from other humans — even
if for a very short time. There are
countless spots on campus, which
serve to hide the budding hermit from
his peers.
The best known are Lake Lagunita,
Frost Amphitheatre, Memorial
Church, the museum and the
mausoleum. All these share a sense of
beauty, or, in the case of the
mausoleum, a sense of mystery. They
are not original in any sense, however.
What good is a special "mood" place,
if everyone else comes there for the
same reason? The trick is to find a
lonely place where you can be moody
by yourself.
Take the Main Library stacks, for
example. God only knows how many
students have dropped dead and
completely decomposed there without
being noticed. If a pin dropped in this
castle of carrels, the thundering blast
would no doubt knock some
nearsighted librarian into an early
grave. Since perfect solitude carries
with it a high risk of being forgotten
indefinitely, a more realistic suggestion
might be the Tresidder Coffee House.
The Coffee House offers a warm,
almost stuffy atmosphere complete
with the pungent aroma from Winston,
Marlboro and Salem addicts. Some
nights the house is quite crowded, but
the same people don't stay for long,
especially if they happen to sample
one of those Italian sodas during their
visit.
