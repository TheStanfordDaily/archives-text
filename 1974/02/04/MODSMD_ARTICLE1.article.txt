# Li Examines 'Barefoot Doctors'
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Diane Li wears a deep blue Chinese silk jacket
over bell-bottomed jeans — symbolizing a meeting
of the Oriental and the Occidental worlds.
She is a graduate student in the Department of
Communication, studying and making films about
China while living and working in the United States.
A giant editing machine crowds nearly all the
available space of her small office in Spruce Hall.
She sits quietly at her desk, using a film canister as a
make-shift ashtray, discussing her master's thesis — a
film on medical practices in China.
On her right hangs a Peanuts cartoon poster:
Lucy appears with arms outstretched, exclaiming,
"I FEEL FREE."
Freedom
Li asserts her freedom in her work. "I am an
independent film maker," she says."I research a
subject and use that information, making it available
to many people. Some things can be communicated
most effectively through film."
A graduate of Wellesley College, Li came here in
1970 when her husband, Victor, joined the law
school faculty. He is now an associate professor,
specializing in Chinese law and government.
Last summer, Li and her husband, accompanied
by a group of medical experts, visited the Peoples'
Republic of China to study medical practices. It was
her job to "capture the flavor of China" in her film.
"I've always wanted to make a film about China.

My purpose [for the master's thesis] was to portray
the Chinese life style. I could communicate with the
people, giving me a closer picture of the Chinese
than any Western journalist could find. In America,
we think of China as being inhabited by 800 million
blue ants."
'Barefoot Doctors'
The film concerns the activities of the "barefoot
doctors." It was her husband's idea. He thought it
was "incredible what the barefoot doctors were
doing," Li said.
The term "barefoot doctor" comes from the
concept of the doctor as one of the common
people, a figure with whom they can relate.
"They [barefoot doctors] command a lot of
respect. We have the heritage of the miracle worker
— like Jesus Christ. The Chinese can't wait that
long. The barefoot doctor learns to spot the
symptoms of disease in his specific area. He gives
medicine, acupuncture treatments and herbs at low
prices," she said.
Inexpensive Medicine
During a film session, Li felt ill, so she bought
medicine from one barefoot doctor for 13 cents.
"When it's that cheap," she said, "the Chinese are
not afraid to seek medical care. In the United
States, I sense a reluctance for people to go to their
doctor."
The barefoot doctor also provides contraceptives
and instructions for their use. "In Shanghai, they

are experimenting with a one-pill-per-month
program," Li explained. "Fifty percent of the
doctors are female, and they don't leave the house
until the pill is taken, but the doctor is always
smiling and never coercive."
Li stresses this human concern in her film,
Cooperative Medical Care and the Barefoot Doctor
in China. At her request, the Chinese government
did no editing or censoring of the film. In fact, all
processing was done in the United States.
Notoriety
The film is not due for release until May, but Li
has already gained considerable notoriety. The
American Public Health Association asked her to
talk to members and to show highlights of the film.
Television stations have shown interest in seeing it,
and the State Department in Washington has asked
her for information on Chinese family planning
programs.
Li's film is only one part of a project instigated
by her husband on the barefoot doctors. He has
written scholarly articles on the subject and will
soon publish a book.
When she is not editing her master's project,
Diane works on films with the Department of
Communication here. Last weekend, she directed a
crew at the Chinatown New Year's parade. In
addition, she serves as a teaching assistant in the
Communication 200 course.

FILMMAKER — Communication Department graduate student Diane Li is using
material gained during her recent trip to China for her master's project: a film on
the so-called "barefoot doctors" of the People's Republic.
Diane Li wears a deep blue Chinese silk jacket
over bell-bottomed jeans — symbolizing a meeting
of the Oriental and the Occidental worlds.
She is a graduate student in the Department of
Communication, studying and making films about
China while living and working in the United States.
A giant editing machine crowds nearly all the
available space of her small office in Spruce Hall.
She sits quietly at her desk, using a film canister as a
make-shift ashtray, discussing her master's thesis — a
film on medical practices in China.
On her right hangs a Peanuts cartoon poster:
Lucy appears with arms outstretched, exclaiming,
"I FEEL FREE."
Freedom
Li asserts her freedom in her work. "I am an
independent film maker," she says."I research a
subject and use that information, making it available
to many people. Some things can be communicated
most effectively through film."
A graduate of Wellesley College, Li came here in
1970 when her husband, Victor, joined the law
school faculty. He is now an associate professor,
specializing in Chinese law and government.
Last summer, Li and her husband, accompanied
by a group of medical experts, visited the Peoples'
Republic of China to study medical practices. It was
her job to "capture the flavor of China" in her film.
"I've always wanted to make a film about China.

My purpose [for the master's thesis] was to portray
the Chinese life style. I could communicate with the
people, giving me a closer picture of the Chinese
than any Western journalist could find. In America,
we think of China as being inhabited by 800 million
blue ants."
'Barefoot Doctors'
The film concerns the activities of the "barefoot
doctors." It was her husband's idea. He thought it
was "incredible what the barefoot doctors were
doing," Li said.
The term "barefoot doctor" comes from the
concept of the doctor as one of the common
people, a figure with whom they can relate.
"They [barefoot doctors] command a lot of
respect. We have the heritage of the miracle worker
— like Jesus Christ. The Chinese can't wait that
long. The barefoot doctor learns to spot the
symptoms of disease in his specific area. He gives
medicine, acupuncture treatments and herbs at low
prices," she said.
Inexpensive Medicine
During a film session, Li felt ill, so she bought
medicine from one barefoot doctor for 13 cents.
"When it's that cheap," she said, "the Chinese are
not afraid to seek medical care. In the United
States, I sense a reluctance for people to go to their
doctor."
The barefoot doctor also provides contraceptives
and instructions for their use. "In Shanghai, they

are experimenting with a one-pill-per-month
program," Li explained. "Fifty percent of the
doctors are female, and they don't leave the house
until the pill is taken, but the doctor is always
smiling and never coercive."
Li stresses this human concern in her film,
Cooperative Medical Care and the Barefoot Doctor
in China. At her request, the Chinese government
did no editing or censoring of the film. In fact, all
processing was done in the United States.
Notoriety
The film is not due for release until May, but Li
has already gained considerable notoriety. The
American Public Health Association asked her to
talk to members and to show highlights of the film.
Television stations have shown interest in seeing it,
and the State Department in Washington has asked
her for information on Chinese family planning
programs.
Li's film is only one part of a project instigated

soon publish a book.
