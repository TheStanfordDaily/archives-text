# Academic Enrichment v. Vocational Training
## Maintain A Balanced Curriculum 
### 
Mike Hernia

The campus-wide discussion on the pursuit of
learning at Stanford that has been generated by the
recent distribution of A Stanford Education by the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies and by the
presentation of the "State of the University
Address" by President Lyman earlier this quarter
can only encourage the healthy activity of academic
introspection by any member of the university
community interested in his/her own life and its
ultimate goal.
The most publicized area of debate appears to be
that of the relative importance of a liberal arts,
non-career oriented education versus a more
specialized, vocational training education.
A disturbing theme that pervades this dialogue is
the seeming tendency by many of the proponents
for either side to consider their own viewpoints
ideal to the exclusion of the other. The
pre-occupation with setting one system as the only
savior to an existing evil (that evil changing with the
persuasion of its opponent) rejects the educational
compromise on which the University now rests, that
between academic enrichment and societal
demands.
In attempting to resolve the running debate, one
should recognize that it represents an expansion of
the more elementary question of what a student's
years can and should be in light of his future and his
own self.
University's Responsibility
Nearly one hundred pages of A Stanford
Education are spent in providing differing criteria
for resolving that question and, while various
conclusions are drawn, one central concept presents
itself to the reader: that for the experience at
Stanford to be truly worthwhile, it is the
University's responsibility as an academic institution
to provide the opportunity and the guidance for
each individual to develop his mind to such a degree
as to cope best with the realities of human
experience.
The incoming University freshman is, in essence,
a living repository of elementary information and
logic brought together in some form by a typically
highly structured secondary education. A University
graduate will find himself increasingly forced to
make judgments in his life based on that knowledge.
It is Stanford's academic burden to furnish the
means by which the randomly obtained wisdom of

previous education can be molded into a form
better able to meet the exigencies of adulthood
critically and analytically. The problem then arises
as to where the University will lay stress in its
approach, whether in emphasizing the depth of
learning in one field, or its breadth in all fields.
Economic Reality
It would be unrealistic to ignore the present and
growing demand for specialists in all fields of human
endeavor. Economic reality makes the acquisition of
special and un-isual talents desirable both financially
and socially and it is, in some ways, an unfortunate
truth that to the large number of Stanford students
economic reality is an obsession.
To deny the presence of that obsession is to
disregard the financial background of a majority of
students, something which I, at least, am not
prepared to do. In the most basic terms, the
quickest means of getting a return on the 14,000
tuition dollars spent at Stanford over four years is
to acquire professional training in a field such as
law, medicine or engineering which yields that
amount in a single year's salary.
I contend that it is part of the University's
responsibility to recognize this attraction to
specialization and, as well as preparing the student
for entrance into the job market, seek to maintain
the balance between academic enrichment and the
demands of society by stressing the importance of a
broad, liberal arts education.
If all attempts are made to emphasize what
Professor Packer refers to, in her essay in A
Stanford Education, as "high level dilettantism," it
is conceivable that the graduating Stanford student
will enter the competitive job market with a good
deal more than a single deeply-instilled manner of
viewing life.
Variety Encouraged
Translating this contention into policy, it is
therefore somewhat predictable that Stanford
officials have recently voiced support for "breadth
of view and length of perspective," as President
Lyman phrased it. The University has several
existing curricular means that would encourage
variety in the academic schedules of its students.
The most obvious is the much-maligned distribution
requirement, a creation which, ostensibly, requires
each student to subject himself to at least six
courses outside his major field. The elimination of

"Mick" courses to fulfill this requirement and/or
the necessity of demonstrating some form of
sequential order to the choice of courses would
make this means both more relevant and more
attractive to the student.
Concepts such as The Stanford Compendium of
Topical Studies and the spirit of innovative
programs such as SCIRE and SWOPSI, if not the
programs themselves, should be emphasized in their
importance, inasmuch as there is no better means of
encouraging student acceptance of the University's
committment to a liberal arts education than by
pointing out its rewards, both pleasurable and
academic.
It is not enough for the university passively to
allow the rigors of society to dictate the academic
pursuits of its students. A concerted attempt to
maintain the balanced coexistence of the two
educational orientations must be carried on if the
University is to fulfill its responsibility to the
tuition-paying student. It is therefore encouragin
to witness the regeneration of administratis
advocacy for broad, diversified learning.

and socially and it is, in some ways, an unfortunate
truth that to the large number of Stanford students
economic reality is an obsession.
To deny the presence of that obsession is to
disregard the financial background of a majority of
students, something which I, at least, am not
prepared to do. In the most basic terms, the
quickest means of getting a return on the 14,000
tuition dollars spent at Stanford over four years is
to acquire professional training in a field such as
law, medicine or engineering which yields that
amount in a single year's salary.
I contend that it is part of the University's
responsibility to recognize this attraction to
specialization and, as well as preparing the student
for entrance into the job market, seek to maintain
the balance between academic enrichment and the
demands of society by stressing the importance of a
broad, liberal arts education.
If all attempts are made to emphasize what
Professor Packer refers to, in her essay in A
Stanford Education, as "high level dilettantism," it
is conceivable that the graduating Stanford student
will enter the competitive job market with a good
deal more than a single deeply-instilled manner of
viewing life.
Variety Encouraged
Translating this contention into policy, it is
therefore somewhat predictable that Stanford
officials have recently voiced support for "breadth
of view and length of perspective," as President
Lyman phrased it. The University has several
existing curricular means that would encourage
variety in the academic schedules of its students.
The most obvious is the much-maligned distribution
requirement, a creation which, ostensibly, requires
each student to subject himself to at least six
courses outside his major field. The elimination of

"Mick" courses to fulfill this requirement and/or
the necessity of demonstrating some form of
sequential order to the choice of courses would
make this means both more relevant and more
attractive to the student.
Concepts such as The Stanford Compendium of
Topical Studies and the spirit of innovative
programs such as SCIRE and SWOPSI, if not the
programs themselves, should be emphasized in their
importance, inasmuch as there is no better means of
encouraging student acceptance of the University's
committment to a liberal arts education than by
pointing out its rewards, both pleasurable and
academic.
It is not enough for the university passively to
allow the rigors of society to dictate the academic
pursuits of its students. A concerted attempt to
maintain the balanced coexistence of the two
educational orientations must be carried on if the
University is to fulfill its responsibility to the
tuition-paying student. It is therefore encouragin
to witness the regeneration of administratis
advocacy for broad, diversified learning.

The campus-wide discussion on the pursuit of
learning at Stanford that has been generated by the
recent distribution of A Stanford Education by the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies and by the
presentation of the "State of the University
Address" by President Lyman earlier this quarter
can only encourage the healthy activity of academic
introspection by any member of the university
community interested in his/her own life and its
ultimate goal.
The most publicized area of debate appears to be
that of the relative importance of a liberal arts,
non-career oriented education versus a more
specialized, vocational training education.
A disturbing theme that pervades this dialogue is
the seeming tendency by many of the proponents
for either side to consider their own viewpoints
ideal to the exclusion of the other. The
pre-occupation with setting one system as the only
savior to an existing evil (that evil changing with the
persuasion of its opponent) rejects the educational
compromise on which the University now rests, that
between academic enrichment and societal
demands.
In attempting to resolve the running debate, one
should recognize that it represents an expansion of
the more elementary question of what a student's
years can and should be in light of his future and his
own self.
University's Responsibility
Nearly one hundred pages of A Stanford
Education are spent in providing differing criteria
for resolving that question and, while various
conclusions are drawn, one central concept presents
itself to the reader: that for the experience at
Stanford to be truly worthwhile, it is the
University's responsibility as an academic institution
to provide the opportunity and the guidance for
each individual to develop his mind to such a degree
as to cope best with the realities of human
experience.
The incoming University freshman is, in essence,
a living repository of elementary information and
logic brought together in some form by a typically
highly structured secondary education. A University
graduate will find himself increasingly forced to
make judgments in his life based on that knowledge.
It is Stanford's academic burden to furnish the
means by which the randomly obtained wisdom of

previous education can be molded into a form
better able to meet the exigencies of adulthood
critically and analytically. The problem then arises
as to where the University will lay stress in its
approach, whether in emphasizing the depth of
learning in one field, or its breadth in all fields.
Economic Reality
It would be unrealistic to ignore the present and
growing demand for specialists in all fields of human
endeavor. Economic reality makes the acquisition of
special and un-isual talents desirable both financially
and socially and it is, in some ways, an unfortunate

economic reality is an obsession.

The campus-wide discussion on the pursuit of
learning at Stanford that has been generated by the
recent distribution of A Stanford Education by the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies and by the
presentation of the "State of the University
Address" by President Lyman earlier this quarter
can only encourage the healthy activity of academic
introspection by any member of the university
community interested in his/her own life and its
ultimate goal.
The most publicized area of debate appears to be
that of the relative importance of a liberal arts,
non-career oriented education versus a more
specialized, vocational training education.
A disturbing theme that pervades this dialogue is
the seeming tendency by many of the proponents
for either side to consider their own viewpoints
ideal to the exclusion of the other. The
pre-occupation with setting one system as the only
savior to an existing evil (that evil changing with the
persuasion of its opponent) rejects the educational
compromise on which the University now rests, that
between academic enrichment and societal
demands.
In attempting to resolve the running debate, one
should recognize that it represents an expansion of
the more elementary question of what a student's
years can and should be in light of his future and his
own self.
University's Responsibility
Nearly one hundred pages of A Stanford
Education are spent in providing differing criteria
for resolving that question and, while various
conclusions are drawn, one central concept presents
itself to the reader: that for the experience at
Stanford to be truly worthwhile, it is the
University's responsibility as an academic institution
to provide the opportunity and the guidance for
each individual to develop his mind to such a degree
as to cope best with the realities of human
experience.
The incoming University freshman is, in essence,
a living repository of elementary information and
logic brought together in some form by a typically
highly structured secondary education. A University
graduate will find himself increasingly forced to
make judgments in his life based on that knowledge.
It is Stanford's academic burden to furnish the
means by which the randomly obtained wisdom of

previous education can be molded into a form
better able to meet the exigencies of adulthood
critically and analytically. The problem then arises
as to where the University will lay stress in its
approach, whether in emphasizing the depth of
learning in one field, or its breadth in all fields.
Economic Reality
It would be unrealistic to ignore the present and
growing demand for specialists in all fields of human
endeavor. Economic reality makes the acquisition of
special and un-isual talents desirable both financially
and socially and it is, in some ways, an unfortunate
truth that to the large number of Stanford students
economic reality is an obsession.
To deny the presence of that obsession is to
disregard the financial background of a majority of
students, something which I, at least, am not
prepared to do. In the most basic terms, the
quickest means of getting a return on the 14,000
tuition dollars spent at Stanford over four years is
to acquire professional training in a field such as
law, medicine or engineering which yields that
amount in a single year's salary.
I contend that it is part of the University's
responsibility to recognize this attraction to
specialization and, as well as preparing the student
for entrance into the job market, seek to maintain
the balance between academic enrichment and the
demands of society by stressing the importance of a
broad, liberal arts education.
If all attempts are made to emphasize what
Professor Packer refers to, in her essay in A
Stanford Education, as "high level dilettantism," it
is conceivable that the graduating Stanford student
will enter the competitive job market with a good
deal more than a single deeply-instilled manner of
viewing life.
Variety Encouraged
Translating this contention into policy, it is
therefore somewhat predictable that Stanford
officials have recently voiced support for "breadth
of view and length of perspective," as President
Lyman phrased it. The University has several
existing curricular means that would encourage
variety in the academic schedules of its students.
The most obvious is the much-maligned distribution
requirement, a creation which, ostensibly, requires
each student to subject himself to at least six
courses outside his major field. The elimination of

"Mick" courses to fulfill this requirement and/or
the necessity of demonstrating some form of
sequential order to the choice of courses would
make this means both more relevant and more
attractive to the student.
Concepts such as The Stanford Compendium of
Topical Studies and the spirit of innovative
programs such as SCIRE and SWOPSI, if not the
programs themselves, should be emphasized in their
importance, inasmuch as there is no better means of
encouraging student acceptance of the University's
committment to a liberal arts education than by
pointing out its rewards, both pleasurable and
academic.
It is not enough for the university passively to
allow the rigors of society to dictate the academic
pursuits of its students. A concerted attempt to
maintain the balanced coexistence of the two
educational orientations must be carried on if the
University is to fulfill its responsibility to the
tuition-paying student. It is therefore encouragin
to witness the regeneration of administratis
advocacy for broad, diversified learning.
