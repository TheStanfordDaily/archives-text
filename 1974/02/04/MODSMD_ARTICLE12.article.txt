The Bocher Memorial Prize of
the American Mathematical
Society has been awarded to
Mathematics Prof. Donald S.
Ornstein for his "many
contributions to ergodic (energy
pathways) theory and, in
particular, for his paper entitled
'Bernouilli shifts with the same
entropy are isomorphic.' "
The society president, Prof.
Saunders Mac Lane of the
University of Chicago, made the
presentation to Ornstein at the
society's recent national meeting
in San Francisco. The Bocher
Prize is awarded only every five
years to a mathematician "who
has published a notable research
memoir in analysis."
Ornstein came to Stanford in
1960 after teaching at the
University of Wisconsin and two
years of research at the Institute
for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J. He received his bachelor's
and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Chicago.
Prof. Paul Cohen of Stanford
received the prize in 1964.
Previous winners at Stanford
include Donald Spencer, now at
Princeton, and the late A.C.
Schaeffer.
