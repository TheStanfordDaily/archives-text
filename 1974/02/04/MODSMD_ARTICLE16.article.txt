# Fun-Loving Wildcats Fall To Improving Card Gymnasts
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Arizona gymnastics team proved you can
lose and still have fun as the Wildcats fell to the
Cards 156.65 to 154.75 at Maples Pavilion
Saturday night.
The visiting squad showed an enthusiasm and
team spirit, which, though amusing at times,
provided the crowd of 400 or so with a little more
entertainment than they had expected.
From the time their first competitor stepped
onto the mat to the final congratulatory handshake
a the end, the Arizona gymnasts provided as much
of a show off the apparatus as on it. They
applauded when their men got ready to begin the
routine; they cheered when a teammate did a
difficult move, and at the end of every routine, the
entire squad got up to shake hands with the
gymnast and give him a pat on the back.
Stanford, on the other hand, remained more
methodical and less emotional in its presentation.
The difference lay in the basic team philosophies;
where Arizona went for score, the Cards went for
performance.
"Arizona did a lot of difficult moves," explained
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada, "but they lack

some of the basics. They bent their knees and
didn't keep their toes pointed a lot of the time.
They did a lot of muscling in their routines. We
tried to concentrate on form."
Hamada said he was satisfied in general with the
Cards' performance. "This is only the second time
we've thrown the routines together. There's a lot of
work we still need to do, but the guys have shown
some progress since last week."
Steve Hug was the victor in the all-around for
the second week in a row, this time with a 53.7
total for the six events. Ted Marcy continued his
winning streak on the sidehorse with another
excellent 9.5 performance.
Bob Anderson was sick all last week, but
nevertheless turned in some good performances,
including an 8.8 in the floor exercise. Howard
Bessen hit a 9.2 on the rings and won it for the
second time in a row. Ted Miyamoto wound up his
48.7 all-around total with an 8.5 on a new highbar
routine.
The Cards have a two-week break ahead before
facing Pac-8 champion and runner-up Cal and
Washington on the 15th and 16th.

Saturday night.
The visiting squad showed an enthusiasm and
team spirit, which, though amusing at times,
provided the crowd of 400 or so with a little more
entertainment than they had expected.
From the time their first competitor stepped
onto the mat to the final congratulatory handshake
a the end, the Arizona gymnasts provided as much
of a show off the apparatus as on it. They
applauded when their men got ready to begin the
routine; they cheered when a teammate did a
difficult move, and at the end of every routine, the
entire squad got up to shake hands with the
gymnast and give him a pat on the back.
Stanford, on the other hand, remained more
methodical and less emotional in its presentation.
The difference lay in the basic team philosophies;
where Arizona went for score, the Cards went for
performance.
"Arizona did a lot of difficult moves," explained
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada, "but they lack

some of the basics. They bent their knees and
didn't keep their toes pointed a lot of the time.
They did a lot of muscling in their routines. We
tried to concentrate on form."
Hamada said he was satisfied in general with the
Cards' performance. "This is only the second time
we've thrown the routines together. There's a lot of
work we still need to do, but the guys have shown
some progress since last week."
Steve Hug was the victor in the all-around for
the second week in a row, this time with a 53.7
total for the six events. Ted Marcy continued his
winning streak on the sidehorse with another
excellent 9.5 performance.
Bob Anderson was sick all last week, but
nevertheless turned in some good performances,
including an 8.8 in the floor exercise. Howard
Bessen hit a 9.2 on the rings and won it for the
second time in a row. Ted Miyamoto wound up his
48.7 all-around total with an 8.5 on a new highbar
routine.
The Cards have a two-week break ahead before
facing Pac-8 champion and runner-up Cal and
Washington on the 15th and 16th.
