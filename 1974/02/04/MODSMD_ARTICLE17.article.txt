## 
### 
In a meet highlighted by
an outstanding mile race and
a world record shot put
performance, Stanford's
eight-man contingent was
outshined by world-class
competitors in the San
Francisco Indoor Games held
Friday evening at the Cow
Palace.
California's Rick Brown
erased a narrow Stanford lead
on the last leg of the mile
relay to give the Bears a
25-yard, 3:26.9 victory which
snapped the Cardinals'
two-year win streak. Stanford
was second in the three-team
field at 3:29.2.
Dave Bagshaw ran a 7.8 in
the 60-yard high hurdles and
placed fifth, while Tony
Sandoval placed fifth and
Mark McConnell sixth in the
two-mile.
The lone Stanford victory
was 57 year-old coach Payton
Jordan. He won the senior
60-yard dash in 7.1 for the
third straight year.
