# Practice Pays Off For Junior Varsity
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
"Practice makes perfect" reads
he old maxim, and if perfection
vasn't what Stanford's junior
/arsity cagers showed Friday night
ifter a week of heavy workouts,
Lhe performance was close
?nough.
Billy Jones' men evened their
«ason record at 5-5 with an 82-68
'upset" over the California JV,
.vhich entered the contest at 10-4.
"Jones killed 'em in practice
this week," said a team manager
after the game. "He wasn't going
o let them lose this one."
"We worked 'em a little,"
ldmitted assistant coach Bob
Buell after the victory.
Ironically, the man who paced
the Card victory didn't reap the
benefits of the JV's demanding
sessions. Marty Moroski, whose 27
ooints equaled his season high,
practices with the Cardinal varsity
and, for this reason, starts neither
half of the JV contests. He has,
however, played in every JV game
this season.
Tough Adjustment
Buell concedes that because
Moroski "never practices with
us," adjustment to his
quasi-regular JV status is "hard
for him." But, Buell says, starting
Moroski would be "really unfair"
to those JV players who assume
first string status in practice all
week.
His playing time limited in
such a way, Moroski made the
best of the situation Friday,
scoring nine of his points during
the last 6:15 of the game, after
Cal had threatened to seize
momentum and do to the Cards
what Menlo and San Jose State
did in recent weeks: beat them in
the waning moments.
"We told them, 'let's slow it
down, let's dictate,' " Buell said
of the talks he and Jones gave
their players during key time-outs
in the late minutes. "They [the
Bears] dictated a little more than

we wanted them to." Still, Cal
never got closer than within eight
alter halftime.
Guard Terry McCartin also
chipped in crucial baskets in the
late stages and scored 15 points
for the night. Stanford's point
total was its highest of the season.
'Hustle'
Buell credited "hustle" for the
win. "We didn't do a lot of things
smart," commented the former
Cardinal varsity eager.
"Our wings [usually Moroski
and Sven Walker] showed good
movement" when center Scott
Russell had to leave the game for
an emergency taping, Buell said.
The 6-8 pivotman's operation
proved successful: he gathered 17
rebounds, a personal juid team
high for the season, and led
Stanford's .643 percentage from
the line with five of six free
throws.
Cal played without its heralded
freshman Don Weaver, who joined
the varsity, but substituted 6-8
sophomore Pat Matola, who
proved more than adequate.
Matola scored 25 points, but got
only three rebounds, a big factor
in allowing normally inept
Stanford to lose the carom war to
the taller Bears by only 48-42.
None of the other Bears
showed much, however, and
Stanford was able to keep an 8-10
point lead through much of the
game despite some sloppy
ball-handling.
"We were getting in a hurry in
the second half," Buell gave as a
reason for the flurry of turnovers
(actually Cal committed 10 more,
28-18). "We wanted to run — we
can accept a few there. But the
dumb ones . .
California, as well as being
charitable with the ball, gave the
Cards plenty of chances at the
charity line, committing 26 fouls
to Stanford's 16. Buell described
the game as "really physical. A lot
of people were getting hammered
out there."

WHO'S ON TOP? — California's Rickie Hawthorne stands above
Stanford's Melvin Arterberry in this picture, but Arterberry's
Cardinals eventually triumphed over Hawthorne's Bears, 71-53. The
highly touted Hawthorne managed only one field goal in seven
attempts, while Arterberry's floor game spearheaded Stanford's
fast-paced performance.
