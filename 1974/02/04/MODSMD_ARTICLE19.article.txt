# Rugby Team Wins Again
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Playing before a large crowd at
Harry Maloney Field on a
beautiful Groundhog Day,
Stanford's rugby team won its
fourth game in a row Saturday,
defeating the Peninsula Ramblers,
12-3.
"Give a lot of credit to the
rooting section," said Lawry
Lieberman. "They really helped
us a lot and they saw a good
rugby game with lots of hard
hitting."
The Cards had fallen behind
early for the past two weeks and
it looked like the ruggers were up
to their old tricks Saturday as the
Ramblers jumped off to an early
3-0 first quarter lead. But the
Cards controlled the rest of the
contest.
Stanford's scrums dominated
the ball in the first half, moving
the ball down to the Ramblers'
three yard-line early in the period.
But the Rambler defense stiffened
and Stanford missed a penalty
kick.
Lieberman then got the ball for
the Cards and passed to John
Armstrong, who twisted in for the
try. Lieberman added the extra
point and the Cards had a 6-3
halftime lead.
The Cards came out
dominating the second half.
Stanford moved into scoring
position early in the half only to
miss a penalty kick. The Ramblers
went on the march and it looked
like the Cards were in trouble. But
John Snider rescued the Cards,
picking up a Rambler fumble at
mid-field and racing into the end
zone for what turned out to be
the winning try. Lieberman added
the extra point, giving the Cards a
12-3 margin.
The fans were treated to some
great defense the rest of the day.
Fullback Eric Test thwarted a
Rambler drive with a great hit
which caused a fumble. Gordy
Riegel played a great defensive
game before he left with an elbow
injury.
