# USE Reports Snags In Negotiations

### GEORGE TIBBITS DON COX 
he slow progress of contract
tiations between the United
ford Employees (USE) union and
University has increased the
hood of a strike, USE President
Berk warned at the union's
,ke Workshop" Saturday.
peaking to about 70 people in
iop Auditorium, Berk reviewed the
gress of negotiations and the issues
er which disagreements have arisen.
Following his address, the
coordinators of past strikes against
Sears, BART, Kaiser Hospital and
Redwood City outlined the technical

details of striking and emphasized the
need for both tight organization and
student support.
Union Shop
Berk said negotiations have not yet
resolved the USE's demand for a union
shop, whereby all new employees of
the University must join the union and
pay dues.
The University has turned down a
USE compromise for an agency shop,
in which new employees would be
required to pay dues but would not
have to join the union, according to
Berk.
Although the University granted
the firemen an agency shop in a recent

contract, the University claims that
USE election results indicate a
significant number of employees
oppose unionization and an agency
shop, Berk said.
Basic Issues
Linda Crouse and Tim Knaak,
contract representatives for USE, said
after the meeting that little real
progress has been made on basic issues
such as the establishment of a
grievance procedure, wage scales, and a
maintenance of standards clause — an
agreement that working conditions
and pay must not sink below the
present status.
According to Crouse and Knaak,
the University has offered a 4.3
percent cost of living increase, but the
union is asking quarterly increases of
six dollars a month for every index
point increase in the federal cost of
living guidelines.
Crouse pointed out that only the
first three articles of the nine under
consideration have been discussed
since negotiations began in December.
She said the University's strategy
"could be to go as slowly as possible,
drag on and on, taking a hard line.
Then they'll make an offer hoping the
people will accept."
Berk attributed the slow pace of
negotiations to the absence of outside
pressure on either team. He
encouraged the union to increase use
of pressure tactics.
Turnout
Berk said that he was "very
encouraged" by the turnout for the
meeting. "The people who came out
are doers," he said, mentioning that
many had signed up to work on union
committees.
For example, a picket line was
formed at the Medical Center cafeteria
by a small group of Medical Center
workers Friday. This was an
"informational picket," according to
Crouse, to publicize worker's positions
rather than to shut down the center.
Crouse pointed out that the
picketing also showed opposition to a
clause in the contract proposed by the
University allowing management to
discipline any employee, union or not,
for picketing or otherwise interfering
with work or operations of the
University.
Other union pressure tactics include

circulating petitions and calling in sick.
"Different small groups will do
different things," Crouse said.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady,
who attended the workshop,
commented, "It seems the University
is trying to break the union."
O'Grady said that student support
for the union was "almost a certainty"
but that consideration must be given
to the degree and nature of this
support.
Coordinators from the Redwood
City strike had emphasized specifically
the need for student support and
assistance. This support is especially
crucial, they said, on a campus like
Stanford.
