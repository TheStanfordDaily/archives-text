# Cards Defeat Five Foes
## Trompas Paces Golf Romp 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Like the classical hero, Aly
Trompas was humble in victory.
Trompas fired a two-under-par
69 Friday on the Stanford course,
grabbing individual honors and
leading the Cardinals to an easy
victory in Stanford's imaginatively
named "18-hole tournament."
But he didn't stand around the
18th green and gloat about his
victory. He didn't give a
hole-by-hole account or reminisce
about his birdies. He didn't even
smile much.

Instead, hungry Trompas
stormed into the clubhouse to
find some food, leaving his caddy
to do the talking.
"Today was the second time
I've caddied for Aly," said Kelly
Walker, Trompas' roommate and a
possible starter in the defensive
backfield for Stanford's 1974
football team, "and it was the
second time he's won a
tournament."
Walker then patted his dog
Bernie, a faithful galleryite
throughout the 18 holes. Later,
Trompas admitted that "Bernie

pulled me through on the back
side."
On Thursday, some thought
Trompas wouldn't even tee it up
because of some painful cartilage
damage in his right knee — an
injury that may eventually require
surgery. "I think it hurts a lot less
than he says it does," Walker said.
Trompas explained that the
knee doesn't bother him when he
runs, but it hurts when he moves
laterally during his golf swing.
Anyway, the pain was eased
Friday as Trompas coasted
effortlessly along the windswept
Stanford layout. He bogied only
three holes, a figure more than
offset by five birdies.
Trompas' teammates were less
spectacular, but still managed to
finish second, third and fourth in
the individual standings. Dave
Baskins and Conrad Nilmeiet fired
73's, while George Pettinger
carded a 74.
Freshmen Brent Murray and
Glenn Goethels weren't quite
down to par with scores of 78 and
80 respectively, but in
tournament play, only the top
four scores count toward the team
total.
So Stanford's four-man score
was 289, 17 strokes ahead of
runnerup San Jose State and 24 in
front of third place California.
Hay ward State and San Francisco
State tied for fourth with 321,
and Santa Clara finished sixth at
326.
"289 is getting down there,"
said pleased Stanford coach Bud
Finger. "That score can win a lot
of tournaments."
In a freshman match held
immediately following the
tournament, Foothill College
defeated the Stanford frosh, 18-9.
David Haugh (79) and Mike
Riordan (81) played respectably
for Stanford, but the final four
players managed only Vi out of a
possible 12 points.

David Haugh (79) and Mike
Riordan (81) played respectably
for Stanford, but the final four
players managed only Vi out of a
possible 12 points.
Like the classical hero, Aly
Trompas was humble in victory.
Trompas fired a two-under-par
69 Friday on the Stanford course,
grabbing individual honors and
leading the Cardinals to an easy
victory in Stanford's imaginatively
named "18-hole tournament."
But he didn't stand around the
18th green and gloat about his
victory. He didn't give a
hole-by-hole account or reminisce
about his birdies. He didn't even
smile much.

Instead, hungry Trompas
stormed into the clubhouse to
find some food, leaving his caddy
to do the talking.
"Today was the second time
I've caddied for Aly," said Kelly
Walker, Trompas' roommate and a
possible starter in the defensive
backfield for Stanford's 1974
football team, "and it was the
second time he's won a
tournament."
Walker then patted his dog
Bernie, a faithful galleryite
throughout the 18 holes. Later,
Trompas admitted that "Bernie

pulled me through on the back
side."
On Thursday, some thought
Trompas wouldn't even tee it up
because of some painful cartilage
damage in his right knee — an
injury that may eventually require
surgery. "I think it hurts a lot less
than he says it does," Walker said.
Trompas explained that the
knee doesn't bother him when he
runs, but it hurts when he moves
laterally during his golf swing.
Anyway, the pain was eased
Friday as Trompas coasted
effortlessly along the windswept
Stanford layout. He bogied only
three holes, a figure more than
offset by five birdies.
Trompas' teammates were less
spectacular, but still managed to
finish second, third and fourth in
the individual standings. Dave
Baskins and Conrad Nilmeiet fired
73's, while George Pettinger
carded a 74.
Freshmen Brent Murray and
Glenn Goethels weren't quite
down to par with scores of 78 and
80 respectively, but in
tournament play, only the top
four scores count toward the team
total.
So Stanford's four-man score
was 289, 17 strokes ahead of
runnerup San Jose State and 24 in
front of third place California.
Hay ward State and San Francisco
State tied for fourth with 321,
and Santa Clara finished sixth at
326.
"289 is getting down there,"
said pleased Stanford coach Bud
Finger. "That score can win a lot
of tournaments."
In a freshman match held
immediately following the
tournament, Foothill College
defeated the Stanford frosh, 18-9.
