# Swimmers Dunk Santa Clara
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
Stanford's swimmers took time
out from their heavy training
Saturday afternoon to meet and
defeat Santa Clara Swim Club
87-44. Despite all the hard work
that they've done lately, several of
coach Jim Gaughran's swimmers
performed surprisingly well.
John Hencken set a new pool
record in the 200 breast,
recording a season's best time of
2:04.9. John also gave the 50 free
a try and turned out a cool 21.5
to place second behind Dave
Fairbank's 21.0.
Steve Strong did his season's

best in the 500, winning with a
4:43.1. Terry Sutton followed in
4:46.2. Ail-American captain
Martin Pedley, normally seen only
in the sprints, made a glorious
appearance in the 200 freestyle,
slashing five seconds off his
lifetime best in 1:48.2. The race
was won by Bruce Goodwin in
1:44.5.
In the diving tank, freshman
Wayne Wager flew to firsts in both
the one- and three-meter events,
but more importantly qualified
for the NCAA championships.
Hitting his dives from the
one-meter board with remarkable

consistency, Wager scored 294.90
reserve himself a seat on the
plane to Long Beach next month.
While there were some great
individual performances, getting
up for Saturday's meet seemed to
be somewhat of an effort for the
team as a whole. It was obvious
that the Card's minds were
somewhere else ... like Los
Angeles two weeks from now. On
the 15th and the 16th of this
month the swimmers travel to
Smogsville to face second-ranked
USC and third-ranked UCLA.
Even the coaches were looking
beyond Santa Clara, scheduling a
workout before the meet.
SWIMMING NOTES: Sprinter
Dean Anderson missed swimming
in Saturday's yawner because of
illness, but should be ready for
the trip south .... The 200 free,
one of Stanford's weaker events,
got a shot in the arm from Bruce
Goodwin's fine effort... Martin
Pedley wanted it be known that
while the team was in New York
City on its eastern trip, the first
place visited was the Guggenheim
Museum. However the swimmers
still ended up at the Playboy
Club.

John Hencken set a new pool
record in the 200 breast,
recording a season's best time of
2:04.9. John also gave the 50 free
a try and turned out a cool 21.5
to place second behind Dave
Fairbank's 21.0.
Steve Strong did his season's

best in the 500, winning with a
4:43.1. Terry Sutton followed in
4:46.2. Ail-American captain
Martin Pedley, normally seen only
in the sprints, made a glorious
appearance in the 200 freestyle,
slashing five seconds off his
lifetime best in 1:48.2. The race
was won by Bruce Goodwin in
1:44.5.
In the diving tank, freshman
Wayne Wager flew to firsts in both
the one- and three-meter events,
but more importantly qualified
for the NCAA championships.
Hitting his dives from the
one-meter board with remarkable

consistency, Wager scored 294.90
reserve himself a seat on the
plane to Long Beach next month.
While there were some great
individual performances, getting
up for Saturday's meet seemed to
be somewhat of an effort for the
team as a whole. It was obvious
that the Card's minds were
somewhere else ... like Los
Angeles two weeks from now. On
the 15th and the 16th of this
month the swimmers travel to
Smogsville to face second-ranked
USC and third-ranked UCLA.
Even the coaches were looking
beyond Santa Clara, scheduling a
workout before the meet.
SWIMMING NOTES: Sprinter
Dean Anderson missed swimming
in Saturday's yawner because of
illness, but should be ready for
the trip south .... The 200 free,
one of Stanford's weaker events,
got a shot in the arm from Bruce
Goodwin's fine effort... Martin
Pedley wanted it be known that
while the team was in New York
City on its eastern trip, the first
place visited was the Guggenheim
Museum. However the swimmers
still ended up at the Playboy
Club.
