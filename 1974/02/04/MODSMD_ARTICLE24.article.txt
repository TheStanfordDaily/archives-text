# Win, Loss, Tie Mark Wrestlers' Trip North
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The wrestling team returned
from a three-day northern trip
with no better record than when
they left, but with a good deal
more experience. The Cards now
stand at 6-6-1 after a tie, a loss
and a win.
Last Thursday, Chico and
Stanford battled to a 21-21 tie. It
was a tough decision, as the Cards
won five of eight matches (there
were two forfeits), but had two
grapplers pinned.
Friday was more or less a
nightmare against Oregon, one of
the best teams in the nation. The
Ducks recorded a 36-0 victory,
but if you include two forfeits

and a one-point penalty against
Stanford Coach Joe De Meo, the
margin becomes 48 to minus one.
De Meo wasn't upset with the
expected loss. He praised Marc
Yancey (134) and Roy Tolles
(190) for their efforts. Yancey,
going against Oregon's top
grappler, was edged 4-2. Tolles led
his match twice, but was
outscored 20-14 in what De Meo
called "the most exciting match
of the night."
Saturday, the Cards turned the
table, easily handling Oregon
Tech, 30-6. Charlie Masch (150)
was the star of the meet with a
third round pin, which earned him
a plaque as outstanding wrestler.
Jeff Richardson (167) turned
in an amazing performance. After
trailing 5-0, he fought back, and
forced his opponent to be
dissqualified after numerous
stalling warnings.
In the other matches, Jim
Tatarakis (126) won 9-4 and
Yancey triumphed by a 5-4
margin. Jim Rappaport (142) lost
5-2. Marc Frelier (177) suffered
the Cards' other defeat, 9-7.
Emmett Stanton, back in
action after a month layoff from
an injury, recorded his first win,
an 8-1 decision. Mark Marsing
(190) received a forfeit, and
Tolles, wrestling a 240-pound
heavyweight, showed that a
50-pound difference didn't matter
as he recorded a 6-0 shutout.
The Cards are back on the road
tomorrow, this time to
Sacramento State, where they will
try to bring their record above the
500 mark.

with no better record than when
they left, but with a good deal
more experience. The Cards now
stand at 6-6-1 after a tie, a loss
and a win.
Last Thursday, Chico and
Stanford battled to a 21-21 tie. It
was a tough decision, as the Cards
won five of eight matches (there
were two forfeits), but had two
grapplers pinned.
Friday was more or less a
nightmare against Oregon, one of
the best teams in the nation. The
Ducks recorded a 36-0 victory,
but if you include two forfeits

and a one-point penalty against
Stanford Coach Joe De Meo, the
margin becomes 48 to minus one.
De Meo wasn't upset with the
expected loss. He praised Marc
Yancey (134) and Roy Tolles
(190) for their efforts. Yancey,
going against Oregon's top
grappler, was edged 4-2. Tolles led
his match twice, but was
outscored 20-14 in what De Meo
called "the most exciting match
of the night."
Saturday, the Cards turned the
table, easily handling Oregon
Tech, 30-6. Charlie Masch (150)
was the star of the meet with a
third round pin, which earned him
a plaque as outstanding wrestler.
Jeff Richardson (167) turned
in an amazing performance. After
trailing 5-0, he fought back, and
forced his opponent to be
dissqualified after numerous
stalling warnings.
In the other matches, Jim
Tatarakis (126) won 9-4 and
Yancey triumphed by a 5-4
margin. Jim Rappaport (142) lost
5-2. Marc Frelier (177) suffered
the Cards' other defeat, 9-7.
Emmett Stanton, back in
action after a month layoff from
an injury, recorded his first win,
an 8-1 decision. Mark Marsing
(190) received a forfeit, and
Tolles, wrestling a 240-pound
heavyweight, showed that a
50-pound difference didn't matter
as he recorded a 6-0 shutout.
The Cards are back on the road
tomorrow, this time to
Sacramento State, where they will
try to bring their record above the
500 mark.
