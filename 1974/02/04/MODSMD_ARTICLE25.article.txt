# Cardinals Blitz Bears For First Pac-8 Victory
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It was another laugher Friday
night at Maples Pavilion, but
Rickie Hawthorne left the floor
frowning.
Hawthorne, a slithery guard
who seems to frustrate every team
except Stanford, converted only
1-7 field goal attempts and
committed seven turnovers as
Stanford romped to its first
Pacific Eight victory, 71-53 over
California.
It wasn't really that close.
Stanford built a 71-46 margin
with 2:42 remaining before the
Cardinal bomb squad tried to
thrill Stanford's fans with some
offensive acrobatics reminiscent
of last Friday's 108-point
outburst against Denver.
The shots wouldn't fall this
time, but it didn't matter.
Cardinal starters had built an
insurmountable lead, thanks to
Stanford's resurgent fast break.
The Cards, called "some very
tall, very slow trees" by the New
York Daily News in December,
literally ran their opponent off
the court for the second week in a
row.
One reason for the success of
the fast break was Stanford's
57-39 rebounding edge. But the
main reason was the explosive
play of guard Melvin Arterberry,
who did everything for Stanford
Hawthorne was supposed to do
for Cal.
Anticipation
Arterberry scored eight points,
contributed five assists, grabbed

five rebounds and hounded
countless loose balls. "His
anticipation was amazing," said
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar.
"For one of the few times this
year, we came out and played
hard from the beginning,"
Arterberry said. "We seem to play
better when we run — the whole
team gets more aggressive."
Stanford's aggressiveness not
only propelled the fast break, but
also frustrated Cal's offense. The
Bears never did penetrate the
Cards' sticky zone defense, and 20
times they turned the ball over —
compared to 16 for Stanford.
Those figures represent the first
time the Cards have been
out-tu move red in almost a month.
"Our kids tried like hell," said
disappointed Cal coach Dick
Edwards. "The effort was there —
they just forgot to do some key
things you have to do to beat 'em.
"I thought we were patient in
the first half. Any time you're
facing a zone as big as theirs you
have to be. But in the second half
we just ran short on patience. And
of course the turnovers hurt, and
we didn't shoot well."
Stanford didn't shoot well
either (.365, compared to .367 for
Cal), but the Cards simply played
hard — and well. Rich Kelley, Ed
Schweitzer, Tim Patterson and
Arterberry dominated the boards,
and the former two combined for
39 points.
Schweitzer And Kelley
Everybody expects Kelley to
score, but Schweitzer's recent
performances have been
particularly satisfying. "Eddie did
another outstanding job," said
Dallmar. "We keep forgetting he's
just a sophomore."
Another impressive Cardinal
was Jim Montague, who scored 12
points on 4-8 from the field and
4-4 from the line. Montague,
though, was fuming in the locker
room when he saw the statistics.
"Three assists — I don't believe
it,"he screamed, and then
proceeded to describe each of his
additional scoring passes.
It was an enthusiastic
monologue matched by an
enthusiastic floor performance.
"Jim's finally starting to play like
he did in November practices,"
said Dallmar, "and that's what
we've been waiting for all along."
Stanford has also been waiting

for the victories which finally
materialized the past two weeks.
"We just had a lot of things
happen to us earlier — that's all,"
Dallmar said. "I told the kids we
should go into every game
thinking we can win."
'The kids' themselves are
confident. "We're on our way,"
Arterberry said. "I don't know if
second place is possible, but we
have a good chance for third —
we're gonna go after it."
