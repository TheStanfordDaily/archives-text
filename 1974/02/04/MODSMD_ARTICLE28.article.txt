# Powerful Aztecs Trip Stanford Volleyballers
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
The Stanford volleyball team
fought hard, but fell before the
superior hitting and blocking of
defending NCAA champion San
Diego State 16-14, 7-15, 16-14,
15-13 yesterday in Maples
pavilion.
A vocal crowd of about 600
watched the match, which
definitely established Stanford as
a major collegiate team.
In the first game the Aztecs
jumped ahead 3-0 on the hitting
of Dave Venuti. Stanford came
back on Steve Hoch's big hits and
the game see-sawed back and
forth until the Aztecs slipped
ahead to game point at 14-12.
However, Jim lams' big hit and
an Aztec miscue dueced the game
at 14-all with the Cards serving.
But a missed hit and a Vince Bean
block gave the Aztecs the game at
16-14.
The second game was all
Stanford. lams, Hoch and George
McPheeters repeatedly pounded
good sets down for an easy 15-7
win.

In the third game, Stanford
battled back again from an early
4-0 deficit and zoomed ahead to
game point at 14-10.
lams, Hoch, McPheeters and
Tom Duralde were all magnificent
for the Cards. But three bad hits
and a controversial line call tied
the game at 14. A perfect hit by
the Aztecs' Bob Stafford and a
clutch block by Mike Cote gave
San Diego State the victory.
The Cards tired in the fourth
game before mounting a furious
comeback. A brutal hit from
Willie Mannon brought Stanford
to 13-14, but, the Aztecs took the
game and match on a bad Card
bump.
San Diego State's Ail-American
Chris Marlowe was generally
ineffective all day and was
definitely outshone by lams, who
played almost flawlessly.
Undoubtedly the most
impressive Aztec player was
Laurel Brassey, a 5-7 freshman,
who can only be described as a
great player. Brassey made several
outstanding digs and displayed an
excellent serve.
