Truckers" Shutdown Spreads
The independent truckers' shutdown continued
to grow yesterday, causing two states to call up
3400 National Guardsmen to deal with violence in
the stoppage that has brought warnings of possible
food shortages by today.
Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp urged a 45-day
moratorium on the protests that have spread across
more than 20 states, to avert what he called a
"national economic calamity."
But spokesmen for the striking truckers, and
drivers interviewed yesterday in three states, said
they would not put their rigs back on the road until
they get assurances of lower prices for diesel fuel
and a guarantee that higher fuel costs can be passed
along to trucking companies on a dollar-for-dollar
basis.
More layoffs were reported in Pennsylvania and
Ohio, where the three-day-old spreading strike has
had some support for 10 days. In all, at least 15,000
workers will be temporarily out of work by today,
and thousands more in other areas are in danger if
the shutdown continues much longer.
Pennsylvania called up 2500 National Guardsmen
to relieve 1400 others who have been on duty since
Friday, to stand watch on state highways.
"The actions of a few lawbreakers have created
an atmosphere of fear among truckers who want to
drive their rigs in Ohio," said Gov. John J. Gilligan
as he called up 900 Guardsmen. In Nebraska, Gov.
James Exon directed state troopers to keep him
abreast of problems.
Violence continued. Tires were slashed and hoses
cut at several truck stops. Nails littered some
highways. Truckers in Ohio, South Carolina,
Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Oklahoma and Nebraska reported being
shot at during the night Saturday and on Sunday.
Brezhnev Ends Visit To Cuba
MIAMI — Soviet Communist party leader Leonid
Brezhnev ended yesterday a six-day visit to Cuba
during which he received a report on the country's
recent foreign policy dealings from Prime Minister
Fidel Castro.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, who
accompanied Brezhnev to Cuba, arrived in
Washington yesterday to confer with American
officials today.
Brezhnev and Castro signed a joint declaration on
the eve of the Kremlin official's departure, but its
text was not immediately released.
Havana Radio, monitored in Miami, said that
during Saturday's talks, the Cuban prime minister
"analyzed the position of Cuba in its foreign policy
and the increase of activity in this field during the
recent past." It did not elaborate.

"Fidel also explained the development of the
structure of the Cuban party and state, and the
growth of the economy of our country in the past
three years," the radio added.
Gromyko said the visit of Soviet Communist
party leader Leonid Brezhnev to Cuba "went off
very well" and that the strengthening of relations
between the Soviet Union and Cuba would help
world peace.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger met
Gromyko at the air force base near Washington.
Kissinger, in brief remarks, said the talks with
Gromyko would involve a number of world issues,
specifically citing the strategic arms limitation talks
and European security as examples.
Cambodian Fighting Continues
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government
soldiers backed by river gunboats tried to fight out
of a rebel stronghold with grenade and rifle fire
yesterday as helicopters strafed the insurgents in an
unsuccessful attempt to blast a hole in the U-shaped
trap.
The 700 government troops, their backs to the
Tonle Sap River, have been penned in for two days
by rebel troops near Peam Muk Kampoul eight miles
north of Phnom Penh.
Field reports said that despite the air and river
support, the government soldiers failed to break
through rebel lines. They have a possible escape
route, however, by retreating across the river into
government-controlled territory on the west bank.
Fighting was reported at close quarters. Along
with the grenades, the government soldiers were
reported throwing makeshift explosive charges made
of tin cans filled with gasoline.
The capital's southern and northwestern fronts
were reported quiet, with government troops in
some areas spending more time in pay lines than on
the front.
But field reports said two more battalions of
insurgents moved into position along a line running
north of Samrong, eight miles west of Phnom Penh.
Syrian Artillery Hits Israel
Syria said it wiped out an Israeli missile base,
three tanks and six mortar batteries yesterday in a
two-hour tank and artillery clash that Damascus
described as the heaviest since the October war.
Communiques said Syrim gunners also scored
"direct hits" on several Israeli infantry positions and
destroyed two halftracks with their occupants in
intermittent morning-long skirmishes that touched
off the large armor and artillery duel.
The area of fighting described by Damascus runs
along two-thirds of the Golan Heights cease-fire line.
Fighting has been reported for nine consecutive

days along the irregular 40-mile line where Israeli
forces halted their thrust into Syria at the end of
October.
Oil-Embargo Policy Changes
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Saudi Arabian foreign
minister was quoted yesterday as saying Arabs will
lift their oil embargo "when the United States
proves it takes no pro-Israeli stands."
Omar Sakkaf's statement in an interview with the
pro-Egyptian Beirut newspaper AJ Anwar coincided
with a report in the independent Lebanese daily An
Nahar. The latter quoted informed Arab sources in
Washington as saying the embargo will be lifted
March 1.
President Nixon said in his State of the Union
address Wednesday that Arab leaders plan an urgent
meeting soon that may result in lifting the embargo,
declared along with a general production cutback to
pressure friends of Israel. It later became known he
was referring to an already planned meeting in
Tripoli on Feb. 14.
Ford Favors Nixon Subpoena
WASHINGTON - Vice President Gerald R. Ford
said yesterday the House Judiciary Committee
should be granted the power to subpoena President
Nixon in its impeachment probe but he isn't sure
the authority is enough to bring the President
before the committee.
The vice president also suggested that if
subpoenaed, the President might answer the
committee's questions but not appear in person.
And, Ford said, there is no legal support "for an
unlimited fishing expedition in the office of the
President."

with the grenades, the government soldiers were
reported throwing makeshift explosive charges made
of tin cans filled with gasoline.
The capital's southern and northwestern fronts
were reported quiet, with government troops in
some areas spending more time in pay lines than on
the front.
But field reports said two more battalions of
insurgents moved into position along a line running
north of Samrong, eight miles west of Phnom Penh.
Syrian Artillery Hits Israel
Syria said it wiped out an Israeli missile base,
three tanks and six mortar batteries yesterday in a
two-hour tank and artillery clash that Damascus
described as the heaviest since the October war.
Communiques said Syrim gunners also scored
"direct hits" on several Israeli infantry positions and
destroyed two halftracks with their occupants in
intermittent morning-long skirmishes that touched
off the large armor and artillery duel.
The area of fighting described by Damascus runs
along two-thirds of the Golan Heights cease-fire line.
Fighting has been reported for nine consecutive

days along the irregular 40-mile line where Israeli
forces halted their thrust into Syria at the end of
October.
Oil-Embargo Policy Changes
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Saudi Arabian foreign
minister was quoted yesterday as saying Arabs will
lift their oil embargo "when the United States
proves it takes no pro-Israeli stands."
Omar Sakkaf's statement in an interview with the
pro-Egyptian Beirut newspaper AJ Anwar coincided
with a report in the independent Lebanese daily An
Nahar. The latter quoted informed Arab sources in
Washington as saying the embargo will be lifted
March 1.
President Nixon said in his State of the Union
address Wednesday that Arab leaders plan an urgent
meeting soon that may result in lifting the embargo,
declared along with a general production cutback to
pressure friends of Israel. It later became known he
was referring to an already planned meeting in
Tripoli on Feb. 14.
Ford Favors Nixon Subpoena
WASHINGTON - Vice President Gerald R. Ford
said yesterday the House Judiciary Committee
should be granted the power to subpoena President
Nixon in its impeachment probe but he isn't sure
the authority is enough to bring the President
before the committee.
The vice president also suggested that if
subpoenaed, the President might answer the
committee's questions but not appear in person.
And, Ford said, there is no legal support "for an
unlimited fishing expedition in the office of the
President."
Stanford Ace Wins Tournament
BALTIMORE — Stanford senior Alex "Sandy"
Mayer trounced Clark Graebner 6-2, 6-1 yesterday
to win the Baltimore International Tennis
Championship.
Mayer, the current NCAA champion and a
finalist in last year's Baltimore event, reached the
finals by defeating India's Vijay Amritraj 6-2, 6-2 in
the quarterfinals and ousting West Germany's
Jurgen Fassbender 6-1, 5-7, 6-3 in the semis.
Because Mayer is an amateur, tournament
officials donated his $20,000 first prize to the
United States Lawn Tennis Association.
Today's Weather
Variable cloudiness today with chance of a brief
period of showers. Fair tonight and tomorrow.
Lows tonight in mid 30s to mid 40s. High today and
tomorrow in mid 50s to lower 60s. Variable winds 5
to 15 mph. Chance of rain 30 percent today.
Truckers" Shutdown Spreads
The independent truckers' shutdown continued
to grow yesterday, causing two states to call up
3400 National Guardsmen to deal with violence in
the stoppage that has brought warnings of possible
food shortages by today.
Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp urged a 45-day
moratorium on the protests that have spread across
more than 20 states, to avert what he called a
"national economic calamity."
But spokesmen for the striking truckers, and
drivers interviewed yesterday in three states, said
they would not put their rigs back on the road until
they get assurances of lower prices for diesel fuel
and a guarantee that higher fuel costs can be passed
along to trucking companies on a dollar-for-dollar
basis.
More layoffs were reported in Pennsylvania and
Ohio, where the three-day-old spreading strike has
had some support for 10 days. In all, at least 15,000
workers will be temporarily out of work by today,
and thousands more in other areas are in danger if
the shutdown continues much longer.
Pennsylvania called up 2500 National Guardsmen
to relieve 1400 others who have been on duty since
Friday, to stand watch on state highways.
"The actions of a few lawbreakers have created
an atmosphere of fear among truckers who want to
drive their rigs in Ohio," said Gov. John J. Gilligan
as he called up 900 Guardsmen. In Nebraska, Gov.
James Exon directed state troopers to keep him
abreast of problems.
Violence continued. Tires were slashed and hoses
cut at several truck stops. Nails littered some
highways. Truckers in Ohio, South Carolina,
Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Oklahoma and Nebraska reported being
shot at during the night Saturday and on Sunday.
Brezhnev Ends Visit To Cuba
MIAMI — Soviet Communist party leader Leonid
Brezhnev ended yesterday a six-day visit to Cuba
during which he received a report on the country's
recent foreign policy dealings from Prime Minister
Fidel Castro.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, who
accompanied Brezhnev to Cuba, arrived in
Washington yesterday to confer with American
officials today.
Brezhnev and Castro signed a joint declaration on
the eve of the Kremlin official's departure, but its
text was not immediately released.
Havana Radio, monitored in Miami, said that
during Saturday's talks, the Cuban prime minister
"analyzed the position of Cuba in its foreign policy
and the increase of activity in this field during the
recent past." It did not elaborate.

"Fidel also explained the development of the
structure of the Cuban party and state, and the
growth of the economy of our country in the past
three years," the radio added.
Gromyko said the visit of Soviet Communist
party leader Leonid Brezhnev to Cuba "went off
very well" and that the strengthening of relations
between the Soviet Union and Cuba would help
world peace.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger met
Gromyko at the air force base near Washington.
Kissinger, in brief remarks, said the talks with
Gromyko would involve a number of world issues,
specifically citing the strategic arms limitation talks
and European security as examples.
Cambodian Fighting Continues
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government
soldiers backed by river gunboats tried to fight out
of a rebel stronghold with grenade and rifle fire
yesterday as helicopters strafed the insurgents in an
unsuccessful attempt to blast a hole in the U-shaped
trap.
The 700 government troops, their backs to the
Tonle Sap River, have been penned in for two days
by rebel troops near Peam Muk Kampoul eight miles
north of Phnom Penh.
Field reports said that despite the air and river
support, the government soldiers failed to break
through rebel lines. They have a possible escape
route, however, by retreating across the river into
government-controlled territory on the west bank.
Fighting was reported at close quarters. Along
with the grenades, the government soldiers were
reported throwing makeshift explosive charges made
of tin cans filled with gasoline.
The capital's southern and northwestern fronts

they would not put their rigs back on the road until
they get assurances of lower prices for diesel fuel
and a guarantee that higher fuel costs can be passed
along to trucking companies on a dollar-for-dollar
basis.
More layoffs were reported in Pennsylvania and
Ohio, where the three-day-old spreading strike has
had some support for 10 days. In all, at least 15,000
workers will be temporarily out of work by today,
and thousands more in other areas are in danger if
the shutdown continues much longer.
Pennsylvania called up 2500 National Guardsmen
to relieve 1400 others who have been on duty since
Friday, to stand watch on state highways.
"The actions of a few lawbreakers have created
an atmosphere of fear among truckers who want to
drive their rigs in Ohio," said Gov. John J. Gilligan
as he called up 900 Guardsmen. In Nebraska, Gov.
James Exon directed state troopers to keep him
abreast of problems.
Violence continued. Tires were slashed and hoses
cut at several truck stops. Nails littered some
highways. Truckers in Ohio, South Carolina,
Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Oklahoma and Nebraska reported being
shot at during the night Saturday and on Sunday.
Brezhnev Ends Visit To Cuba
MIAMI — Soviet Communist party leader Leonid
Brezhnev ended yesterday a six-day visit to Cuba
during which he received a report on the country's
recent foreign policy dealings from Prime Minister
Fidel Castro.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, who
accompanied Brezhnev to Cuba, arrived in
Washington yesterday to confer with American
officials today.
Brezhnev and Castro signed a joint declaration on
the eve of the Kremlin official's departure, but its
text was not immediately released.
Havana Radio, monitored in Miami, said that
during Saturday's talks, the Cuban prime minister
"analyzed the position of Cuba in its foreign policy
and the increase of activity in this field during the
recent past." It did not elaborate.

"Fidel also explained the development of the
structure of the Cuban party and state, and the
growth of the economy of our country in the past
three years," the radio added.
Gromyko said the visit of Soviet Communist
party leader Leonid Brezhnev to Cuba "went off
very well" and that the strengthening of relations
between the Soviet Union and Cuba would help
world peace.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger met
Gromyko at the air force base near Washington.
Kissinger, in brief remarks, said the talks with
Gromyko would involve a number of world issues,
specifically citing the strategic arms limitation talks
and European security as examples.
Cambodian Fighting Continues
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Government
soldiers backed by river gunboats tried to fight out
of a rebel stronghold with grenade and rifle fire
yesterday as helicopters strafed the insurgents in an
unsuccessful attempt to blast a hole in the U-shaped
trap.
The 700 government troops, their backs to the
Tonle Sap River, have been penned in for two days
by rebel troops near Peam Muk Kampoul eight miles
north of Phnom Penh.
Field reports said that despite the air and river
support, the government soldiers failed to break
through rebel lines. They have a possible escape
route, however, by retreating across the river into
government-controlled territory on the west bank.
Fighting was reported at close quarters. Along
with the grenades, the government soldiers were
reported throwing makeshift explosive charges made
of tin cans filled with gasoline.
The capital's southern and northwestern fronts
were reported quiet, with government troops in
some areas spending more time in pay lines than on
the front.
But field reports said two more battalions of
insurgents moved into position along a line running
north of Samrong, eight miles west of Phnom Penh.
Syrian Artillery Hits Israel
Syria said it wiped out an Israeli missile base,
three tanks and six mortar batteries yesterday in a
two-hour tank and artillery clash that Damascus
described as the heaviest since the October war.
Communiques said Syrim gunners also scored
"direct hits" on several Israeli infantry positions and
destroyed two halftracks with their occupants in
intermittent morning-long skirmishes that touched
off the large armor and artillery duel.
The area of fighting described by Damascus runs
along two-thirds of the Golan Heights cease-fire line.
Fighting has been reported for nine consecutive

days along the irregular 40-mile line where Israeli
forces halted their thrust into Syria at the end of
October.
Oil-Embargo Policy Changes
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Saudi Arabian foreign
minister was quoted yesterday as saying Arabs will
lift their oil embargo "when the United States
proves it takes no pro-Israeli stands."
Omar Sakkaf's statement in an interview with the
pro-Egyptian Beirut newspaper AJ Anwar coincided
with a report in the independent Lebanese daily An
Nahar. The latter quoted informed Arab sources in
Washington as saying the embargo will be lifted
March 1.
President Nixon said in his State of the Union
address Wednesday that Arab leaders plan an urgent
meeting soon that may result in lifting the embargo,
declared along with a general production cutback to
pressure friends of Israel. It later became known he
was referring to an already planned meeting in
Tripoli on Feb. 14.
Ford Favors Nixon Subpoena
WASHINGTON - Vice President Gerald R. Ford
said yesterday the House Judiciary Committee
should be granted the power to subpoena President
Nixon in its impeachment probe but he isn't sure
the authority is enough to bring the President
before the committee.
The vice president also suggested that if
subpoenaed, the President might answer the
committee's questions but not appear in person.
And, Ford said, there is no legal support "for an
unlimited fishing expedition in the office of the
President."

Truckers" Shutdown Spreads
The independent truckers' shutdown continued
to grow yesterday, causing two states to call up
3400 National Guardsmen to deal with violence in
the stoppage that has brought warnings of possible
food shortages by today.
Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp urged a 45-day
moratorium on the protests that have spread across
more than 20 states, to avert what he called a
"national economic calamity."
But spokesmen for the striking truckers, and
drivers interviewed yesterday in three states, said
they would not put their rigs back on the road until

two-hour tank and artillery clash that Damascus
described as the heaviest since the October war.
Communiques said Syrim gunners also scored
"direct hits" on several Israeli infantry positions and
destroyed two halftracks with their occupants in
intermittent morning-long skirmishes that touched
off the large armor and artillery duel.
The area of fighting described by Damascus runs
along two-thirds of the Golan Heights cease-fire line.
Fighting has been reported for nine consecutive

days along the irregular 40-mile line where Israeli
forces halted their thrust into Syria at the end of
October.
Oil-Embargo Policy Changes
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Saudi Arabian foreign
minister was quoted yesterday as saying Arabs will
lift their oil embargo "when the United States
proves it takes no pro-Israeli stands."
Omar Sakkaf's statement in an interview with the
pro-Egyptian Beirut newspaper AJ Anwar coincided
with a report in the independent Lebanese daily An
Nahar. The latter quoted informed Arab sources in
Washington as saying the embargo will be lifted
March 1.
President Nixon said in his State of the Union
address Wednesday that Arab leaders plan an urgent
meeting soon that may result in lifting the embargo,
declared along with a general production cutback to
pressure friends of Israel. It later became known he
was referring to an already planned meeting in
Tripoli on Feb. 14.
Ford Favors Nixon Subpoena
WASHINGTON - Vice President Gerald R. Ford
said yesterday the House Judiciary Committee
should be granted the power to subpoena President
Nixon in its impeachment probe but he isn't sure
the authority is enough to bring the President
before the committee.
The vice president also suggested that if
subpoenaed, the President might answer the
committee's questions but not appear in person.
And, Ford said, there is no legal support "for an
unlimited fishing expedition in the office of the
President."
