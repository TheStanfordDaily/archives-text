# Prof Seeks Injunction In Class-Action Suit
## 
### DON COX 
Law Prof. William B. Gould will
move for a preliminary injunction
against local Teamsters unions and the
Pacific Intermountain Express (P.1.E.)
company within the next two weeks as
part of a $50 million civil rights suit he
filed in December on behalf of eight
ninority truck drivers.
The injunction seeks to obtain the
imediate hiring of black drivers
fused employment at P.l.E.'s Los
ngeles terminal, and the rehiring of
'vers laid off at the company's
leryville terminal. It also requires
the upgrading of minority employees
from local driving and dockman jobs
to the more lucrative over-thc-road
driving spots, said Gould.
The class action suit charges the
Teamsters and major trucking firms
with "vicious, systematic
discrimination against black and
chicano workers."
"The trucking industry is one of
the most racially exclusionary
industries in the U.S. with minorities
excluded at all levels," said Gould.
Gould is seeking punitive damages
not only for those who applied for
jobs and were refused, but also for
those who would have applied for jobs
but did not because of the firm's
alleged discriminatory reputation.
These damages include back pay and
seniority credits.

The suit, filed under 1964 civil
rights statutes, also asks for training
programs for blacks and chicanos.
Training is vital, Gould said, because
blacks and chicanos are unlikely to
have the work experience a company
insists upon.
Although Gould is just starting the
discovery process, a legal effort to
assemble information for the trial, he
is optimistic about successfully
establishing liability.
"It's quite clear we're going to
win," he said. There is solid evidence
"of explicit racist statements by the
companies" and a statistical case
against the defendants that could
stand by itself, he said. "We have a
better case than in the Detroit Edison
litigation.
"The big question is how much
they are going to have to pay." he
said. This case "should far exceed the
Detroit Edison case in punitive
payments," he added.
In the precedent-setting Detroit
Edison case, Gould's clients were
awarded $4 million in punitive
damages from the utility and
$250,000 from the union because of
discriminatory practices by both
defendants. The case is now on appeal.
"It is difficult to get an effective
remedy for discrimination cases like
this, but the most effective weapon to
