# Prof Seeks Injunction In Class-Action Suit
## 
### DON COX 
Law Prof. William B. Gould will
move for a preliminary injunction
against local Teamsters unions and the
Pacific Intermountain Express (P.1.E.)
company within the next two weeks as
part of a $50 million civil rights suit he
filed in December on behalf of eight
ninority truck drivers.
The injunction seeks to obtain the
imediate hiring of black drivers
fused employment at P.l.E.'s Los
ngeles terminal, and the rehiring of
'vers laid off at the company's
leryville terminal. It also requires
the upgrading of minority employees
from local driving and dockman jobs
to the more lucrative over-thc-road
driving spots, said Gould.
The class action suit charges the
Teamsters and major trucking firms
with "vicious, systematic
discrimination against black and
chicano workers."
"The trucking industry is one of
the most racially exclusionary
industries in the U.S. with minorities
excluded at all levels," said Gould.
Gould is seeking punitive damages
not only for those who applied for
jobs and were refused, but also for
those who would have applied for jobs
but did not because of the firm's
alleged discriminatory reputation.
These damages include back pay and
seniority credits.

The suit, filed under 1964 civil
rights statutes, also asks for training
programs for blacks and chicanos.
Training is vital, Gould said, because
blacks and chicanos are unlikely to
have the work experience a company
insists upon.
Although Gould is just starting the
discovery process, a legal effort to
assemble information for the trial, he
is optimistic about successfully
establishing liability.
"It's quite clear we're going to
win," he said. There is solid evidence
"of explicit racist statements by the
companies" and a statistical case
against the defendants that could
stand by itself, he said. "We have a
better case than in the Detroit Edison
litigation.
"The big question is how much
they are going to have to pay." he
said. This case "should far exceed the
Detroit Edison case in punitive
payments," he added.
In the precedent-setting Detroit
Edison case, Gould's clients were
awarded $4 million in punitive
damages from the utility and
$250,000 from the union because of
discriminatory practices by both
defendants. The case is now on appeal.
"It is difficult to get an effective
remedy for discrimination cases like
this, but the most effective weapon to
deter companies and unions from
future wrongdoing is punitive
damages," Gould said.
The $50 million Gould is seeking in
the current suit is "actually a
conservative figure," said Gould. He
noted that the actual amount awarded
would be decided by the judge.
The federal government, through
the Justice Depaitment, is
investigating discrimination in the
trucking industry. But Gould said that
the Justice Department is only seeking
long-range goals, timetables and
promises to hire minority workers.
'Deception'
"It is deception to say you are
going to establish goals and timetables
buc not provide a training program
through which they can be
implemented," he said.
The Justice Department also uses a
"very conservative approach," and its
actions frequently amount to only "a
slap on the wrist," Gould said.
Gould estimated that the

department had sued on similar legal
grounds only a hundred times in the
last ten years. "They only pick the
sure winners," said Gould.
Gould cites racial inequality as the
"number one problem in the U.S. and
the world. The country and the
government want to turn their backs
on the problem. Something has to be
done about it,"he said.
Gould's success with class action
suits in discrimination cases has
prompted other attorneys to consider
filing suits of their own.
No Money
"The problem is that the small
practitioner does not have the money
to litigate the cases," said Gould. "It
sometimes takes a number of years to
win the cases, and in that time you run
up a lot of bills that aren't paid for a
long time."
Gould advocates a plan whereby
"once a statistical case of racial
discrimination has been made, the
defendants should make a down
payment of the damages to cover the
cost of the rest of the case."
Currently, "defendants often get a
plaintiffs lawyer to sell out cheap in
out-of-court settlements. Cheap
settlements really don't change
things," Gould said.
"Defendants bank upon the lack of
financial sources of plaintiffs," he said.
The Lawyer's Committee in San
Francisco and other civil rights
organizations are funding Gould's
efforts on behalf of the minority
truckers.
"No serious gesture" has been made
by the defendants to settle the suit out
of court, he said. The defendants
remoteness from public pressure and
political connections drains any
incentive to settle, he noted.
Other trucking firms named as
defendants in the suit are Consolidated
Freightways, Garrett Freight Lines,
California Motor Express, Universal
Transport System, Alpha Beta Co.,
California Trucking Association, and
Trucking Employers, Inc.

establishing liability.
"It's quite clear we're going to
win," he said. There is solid evidence
"of explicit racist statements by the
companies" and a statistical case
against the defendants that could
stand by itself, he said. "We have a
better case than in the Detroit Edison
litigation.
"The big question is how much
they are going to have to pay." he
said. This case "should far exceed the
Detroit Edison case in punitive
payments," he added.
In the precedent-setting Detroit
Edison case, Gould's clients were
awarded $4 million in punitive
damages from the utility and
$250,000 from the union because of
discriminatory practices by both
defendants. The case is now on appeal.
"It is difficult to get an effective
remedy for discrimination cases like
this, but the most effective weapon to
deter companies and unions from
future wrongdoing is punitive
damages," Gould said.
The $50 million Gould is seeking in
the current suit is "actually a
conservative figure," said Gould. He
noted that the actual amount awarded
would be decided by the judge.
The federal government, through
the Justice Depaitment, is
investigating discrimination in the
trucking industry. But Gould said that
the Justice Department is only seeking
long-range goals, timetables and
promises to hire minority workers.
'Deception'
"It is deception to say you are
going to establish goals and timetables
buc not provide a training program
through which they can be
implemented," he said.
The Justice Department also uses a
"very conservative approach," and its
actions frequently amount to only "a
slap on the wrist," Gould said.
Gould estimated that the

department had sued on similar legal
grounds only a hundred times in the
last ten years. "They only pick the
sure winners," said Gould.
Gould cites racial inequality as the
"number one problem in the U.S. and
the world. The country and the
government want to turn their backs
on the problem. Something has to be
done about it,"he said.
Gould's success with class action
suits in discrimination cases has
prompted other attorneys to consider
filing suits of their own.
No Money
"The problem is that the small
practitioner does not have the money
to litigate the cases," said Gould. "It
sometimes takes a number of years to
win the cases, and in that time you run
up a lot of bills that aren't paid for a
long time."
Gould advocates a plan whereby
"once a statistical case of racial
discrimination has been made, the
defendants should make a down
payment of the damages to cover the
cost of the rest of the case."
Currently, "defendants often get a
plaintiffs lawyer to sell out cheap in
out-of-court settlements. Cheap
settlements really don't change
things," Gould said.
"Defendants bank upon the lack of
financial sources of plaintiffs," he said.
The Lawyer's Committee in San
Francisco and other civil rights
organizations are funding Gould's
efforts on behalf of the minority
truckers.
"No serious gesture" has been made
by the defendants to settle the suit out
of court, he said. The defendants
remoteness from public pressure and
political connections drains any
incentive to settle, he noted.
Other trucking firms named as
defendants in the suit are Consolidated
Freightways, Garrett Freight Lines,
California Motor Express, Universal
Transport System, Alpha Beta Co.,
California Trucking Association, and
Trucking Employers, Inc.
Law Prof. William B. Gould will
move for a preliminary injunction
against local Teamsters unions and the
Pacific Intermountain Express (P.1.E.)
company within the next two weeks as
part of a $50 million civil rights suit he
filed in December on behalf of eight
ninority truck drivers.
The injunction seeks to obtain the
imediate hiring of black drivers
fused employment at P.l.E.'s Los
ngeles terminal, and the rehiring of
'vers laid off at the company's
leryville terminal. It also requires
the upgrading of minority employees
from local driving and dockman jobs
to the more lucrative over-thc-road
driving spots, said Gould.
The class action suit charges the
Teamsters and major trucking firms
with "vicious, systematic
discrimination against black and
chicano workers."
"The trucking industry is one of
the most racially exclusionary
industries in the U.S. with minorities
excluded at all levels," said Gould.
Gould is seeking punitive damages
not only for those who applied for
jobs and were refused, but also for
those who would have applied for jobs
but did not because of the firm's
alleged discriminatory reputation.
These damages include back pay and
seniority credits.

The suit, filed under 1964 civil
rights statutes, also asks for training
programs for blacks and chicanos.
Training is vital, Gould said, because
blacks and chicanos are unlikely to
have the work experience a company
insists upon.
Although Gould is just starting the
discovery process, a legal effort to
assemble information for the trial, he
is optimistic about successfully
establishing liability.

discrimination against black and
chicano workers."
"The trucking industry is one of
the most racially exclusionary
industries in the U.S. with minorities
excluded at all levels," said Gould.
Gould is seeking punitive damages
not only for those who applied for
jobs and were refused, but also for
those who would have applied for jobs
but did not because of the firm's
alleged discriminatory reputation.
These damages include back pay and
seniority credits.

The suit, filed under 1964 civil
rights statutes, also asks for training
programs for blacks and chicanos.
Training is vital, Gould said, because
blacks and chicanos are unlikely to
have the work experience a company
insists upon.
Although Gould is just starting the
discovery process, a legal effort to
assemble information for the trial, he
is optimistic about successfully
establishing liability.
"It's quite clear we're going to
win," he said. There is solid evidence
"of explicit racist statements by the
companies" and a statistical case
against the defendants that could
stand by itself, he said. "We have a
better case than in the Detroit Edison
litigation.
"The big question is how much
they are going to have to pay." he
said. This case "should far exceed the
Detroit Edison case in punitive
payments," he added.
In the precedent-setting Detroit
Edison case, Gould's clients were
awarded $4 million in punitive
damages from the utility and
$250,000 from the union because of
discriminatory practices by both
defendants. The case is now on appeal.
"It is difficult to get an effective
remedy for discrimination cases like
this, but the most effective weapon to
deter companies and unions from
future wrongdoing is punitive
damages," Gould said.
The $50 million Gould is seeking in
the current suit is "actually a
conservative figure," said Gould. He
noted that the actual amount awarded
would be decided by the judge.
The federal government, through
the Justice Depaitment, is
investigating discrimination in the
trucking industry. But Gould said that
the Justice Department is only seeking
long-range goals, timetables and
promises to hire minority workers.
'Deception'
"It is deception to say you are
going to establish goals and timetables
buc not provide a training program
through which they can be
implemented," he said.
The Justice Department also uses a
"very conservative approach," and its
actions frequently amount to only "a
slap on the wrist," Gould said.
Gould estimated that the

department had sued on similar legal
grounds only a hundred times in the
last ten years. "They only pick the
sure winners," said Gould.
Gould cites racial inequality as the
"number one problem in the U.S. and
the world. The country and the
government want to turn their backs
on the problem. Something has to be
done about it,"he said.
Gould's success with class action
suits in discrimination cases has
prompted other attorneys to consider
filing suits of their own.
No Money
"The problem is that the small
practitioner does not have the money
to litigate the cases," said Gould. "It
sometimes takes a number of years to
win the cases, and in that time you run
up a lot of bills that aren't paid for a
long time."
Gould advocates a plan whereby
"once a statistical case of racial
discrimination has been made, the
defendants should make a down
payment of the damages to cover the
cost of the rest of the case."
Currently, "defendants often get a
plaintiffs lawyer to sell out cheap in
out-of-court settlements. Cheap
settlements really don't change
things," Gould said.
"Defendants bank upon the lack of
financial sources of plaintiffs," he said.
The Lawyer's Committee in San
Francisco and other civil rights
organizations are funding Gould's
efforts on behalf of the minority
truckers.
"No serious gesture" has been made
by the defendants to settle the suit out
of court, he said. The defendants
remoteness from public pressure and
political connections drains any
incentive to settle, he noted.
Other trucking firms named as
defendants in the suit are Consolidated
Freightways, Garrett Freight Lines,
California Motor Express, Universal
Transport System, Alpha Beta Co.,
California Trucking Association, and
Trucking Employers, Inc.
Law Prof. William B. Gould will
move for a preliminary injunction
against local Teamsters unions and the
Pacific Intermountain Express (P.1.E.)
company within the next two weeks as
part of a $50 million civil rights suit he
filed in December on behalf of eight
ninority truck drivers.
The injunction seeks to obtain the
imediate hiring of black drivers
fused employment at P.l.E.'s Los
ngeles terminal, and the rehiring of
'vers laid off at the company's
leryville terminal. It also requires
the upgrading of minority employees
from local driving and dockman jobs
to the more lucrative over-thc-road
driving spots, said Gould.
The class action suit charges the
Teamsters and major trucking firms
with "vicious, systematic
discrimination against black and
chicano workers."
