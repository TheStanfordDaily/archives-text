# Worn-Out Valve Lets Off Steam
## 
### 
A worn-out diaphragm in a pressure
regulation valve caused a 90-minute
steam leak from a manhole on Panama
Street near the Women's Gym
yesterday afternoon, according to
Plant Services Utilities Manager Bob
McKnight.
The diaphragm regulates the
amount of steam entering the gym.
When it wore out, a release valve
dumped the excess steam into the air
rather than letting it enter the pipes of
the gym, which would provide the
building with too much steam
pressure.
After the system was shut off, Plant
Services workmen had to allow the
manhole to cool before any repair
work could be done. McKnight said
that the diaphragm was replaced and
the system is "working fine" now.
