### ED MATHENY 
A free, computerized carpool
matching service for Stanford faculty,
students and staff commuting to
campus will be organized this week.
Frank E. Gallagher Jr., University
transportation coordinator, expects
the new carpool system to become
operational by early March.
The Stanford program will be the

Commuters, a region-wide
computerized service designed to
match individuals sharing common
residential and work locations.
The service will provide individuals
commuting to the campus area with
the names, addresses, phone numbers

and commute times of nine other
University people interested in
carpools and living near them.
Application blanks will be published
this week in the Daily and Campus
Report.
Commuters must fill out and return
the applications to "Carpools," 128

10,000 May Benelit,
Almost 10,000 faculty, staff and
students living beyond biking distance
of the campus are potential
participants in the program, Gallagher
estimated.
Those living in fairly remote
communities would realize the greatest
economic benefits, he added.
Individuals living 10 miles or more
from the University and commuting
alone by car now pay at least $500 in
commute costs annually.
Besides sharing operating costs of
10 cents or more per mile, carpoolers
may qualify for lower insurance rates,
Gallagher pointed out. Almost every
major insurance company now offers
such reductions. Rate cuts range from
13-18 percent and will average about
$30 per year per motorist.
In addition, groups of three or
more carpoolers may qualify for
special University parking, he said.
Authority for such arrangements and
possible locations for carpool parking
lots are still being discussed.
Joint Sponsorship
The program is sponsored by the
California Department of
Transportation, the American

Automobile Association (AAA), the
Federal Highway Association, the U.S.
Bureau of the Census, Hibernia Bank,
KPIX-TV, radio station KSAN and the
Association of Bay Area Governments.
Bruce Couchman, an employee of
the California Department of
Transportation, termed Rides an
"informal" organization. "The time on
the part of everyone can essentially b*>
considered donated, he say a.
According to Couch man, most of
the computer time is being handled by
the California Department of
Transportation. The information from
the applications will be fed into the
Caltrans computer, which is matched
against a Bureau of the Census track.
"Some of the keypunching is being
done by the California Department of
Transportation; some is being done by
larger employers who have those
facilities," said Couchman. The
Hibernia Bank and the AAA are
handling the printing and mailing of
the application forms.
Form Distribution
The forms that have reached
Stanford are part of an initial
distribution which goes to employers
who have 100 or more employees at
one location.
Said Couchman, "The initial
distribution to the employers is largely
to facilitate getting these things out to
the people who will most likely be
able to make use of it."
An extended distribution is
expected within two weeks, when
additional forms will be handed out, in
public places such as gas stations, toll
booths and supermarkets.
