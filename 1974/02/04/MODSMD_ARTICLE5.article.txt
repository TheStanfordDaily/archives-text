# Many Issues 'Unexplained'
## Prof Raps Nixon Speech 
### BILL ROSS 
President Nixon's State of the Union message last
week left many issues of national policy unexplained,
according to Hubert Marshall, professor of Political
Science.
"There were no surprises," Marshall said. "What
impressed me most was his praise of individual freedom.
That was the ultimate in hypocrisy. He has done more to
undermine individual freedom than any other president.
For example, his 'Houston Plan' allowed for wiretapping
and the opening of mail."
Marshall also criticized Nixon's assertion that there
will be no recession. "With rising unemployment and
inflation, he is kidding us with his doubletalk about a
healthy economy," Marshall said.
"His statement that the United States will continue
to aid Vietnam and Cambodia makes it clear that despite
Congressional action ending the bombing, Nixon is still
committed to military action," Marshall remarked.
Praise For Welfare Plan
But Marshall praised Nixon's welfare reform proposal
for a negative income tax.
"We need something like this to end the welfare
mess," Marshall said. "Under Nixon's plan welfare
recipients in all parts of the country would receive equal
benefits."
This would mean that welfare payments in the South
would be greatly increased, while New York City welfare
recipients might receive reduced benefits, Marshall
explained. The plan would also eliminate much of the
red tape that now characterizes the system.
Best of all, said Marshall, the negative income tax

would aid the working poor and allow the male head of
a household to receive benefits.
'Ghastly Rule'
Under the existing system, a man must leave home in
order for his family to receive welfare benefits, Marshall
explained. "This is a ghastly rule as it causes families to
disintegrate," he said.
Marshall credited Daniel Patrick Moynihan, former
presidential adviser for domestic affairs, with convincing
Nixon that only drastic reform could cure the ills of the
present welfare system.
The negative income tax proposal may face
considerable opposition from congressmen who are
devoted to a strict interpretation of the work ethic,
Marshall noted.
Energy Crisis
Marshall also criticized Nixon's inadequate
explanation of his plans for confronting the nation's
energy crisis. Nixon's pledge of national self-sufficiency
in energy will be a difficult goal to achieve, Marshall
predicted. "But any president would probably have told
the country the same thing," he said.
"The President's explanations of Watergate were the
same old kind of doubletalk that he has always given
us," Marshall said. "He said he gave his special
prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, all the information he needs,
but the problem is that Jaworski doesn't yet have an
inventory of all the information held by the President,"
Marshall noted.
"I am also bothered by the President's promise to
fight the impeachment movement," Marshall said. "I
don't know what he means by this generalization. It
could mean that he intends to withhold information."
