Bob Ottilie asserts (Jan. 28), that
the nation's political left wants Nixon
impeached on policy matters.
Democrats are not purposely denying
the 1972 "mandate" of Nixon's
policies; the Congress is caught
between trying to resolve Watergate
and enacting new legislation.
Conceivably, Nixon could be
impeached for any action deemed a
high crime or misdemeanor by the
House and Senate. However, according
to Supreme Court Justice William
Rehnquist, the Supreme Court could
still rule that the alleged offense was
not impeachable under the U.S.
Constitution. Also, a bipartisan
Congress makes a policy impeachment
unlikely.
The American people do need a
definitive statement of specific charges
against Nixon as well as a list of
impeachable offenses.
Mr. Nixon's resignation will not
resolve the question of his involvement
in Watergate. Since Mr. Nixon is
innocent until proven guilty, only a
House vote, currently planned for
April 30 at the latest, will determine
the boundaries of Nixon's alleged
culpability.
If Nixon's innocence is sustained,
the threat to American government
posed by the presence of ignorant or
inept persons in office will have been
effectively demonstrated.

Theta Delt Prank
Editor:
I am writing to express my
contempt for the actions of the
fraternity (Theta Delta Chi, I believe)
which took place in Meyer Library on
the night of 22 January. As an
initiation prank, members of the
fraternity forced a student to remove
his clothes in the third-floor bathroom
and leave the library, having only a
paper towel to cover himself.
This was my first contact with a
Stanford fraternity, and I was grossly
disappointed. This is supposed to be
an academic community, not a nudist
colony. The function of a fraternity
should be to strengthen the academic
atmosphere, not destroy it.
High school was the time for
childish games, but by the time we
reach Stanford, we should be mature
enough to function as decent citizens
in society. It is obvious that these
students have not yet achieved that
stage of maturity. Not only did they
disrupt an atmosphere conducive to
study in the library, but they offended
quite a few people. (I personally know
of two who were* offended by the
spectacle.)
In conclusion, I would like to make
a recommendation regarding methods
to insure that this type of activity does
not continue. I understand that the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity was
suspended from campus last year for a
similar offense. It is my suggestion
that this action, or one comparable, be
taken by the University against the
fraternity responsible for this
immature antic.

Sexism in P. A. Schools
Editoj:
The decision makers of the Palo
Alto Board of Education were asked
to support the law and they evaded
the issue. Perhaps it is better to say
they were afraid to commit themselves
on any formal policy eliminating the
illegal practice of sexism presently
being taught within the school district.
Last Tuesday, the Palo Alto
Chapter of NOW presented a 3-part
proposal for vote by the board: 1)

adopt a resolution formally stating
their intent to comply with the law
prohibiting sex discrimination in the
schools; 2) state exactly when
information will go to the students
and parents stating that all courses in
Home Management and Industrial
ARts shall be open to all students
regardless of sex; and 3) when will
NOW receive the promised drafts of
the catalog and curriculum guideline
changes.
The administrators of the school
district have had the proposal both in
written form, spelled out in detail, and
verbally for the past ten months.
Nothing but promises have been given.
An opportunity for action was
provided Tuesday and again only
promises from the Board — the very
body which makes decisions regarding
policy.
Delay tactics in the form of
"procedure" took precedence over
action and the Board delayed any
further discussion from the audience
regarding this issue until the next
meeting. They must review the
proposal before taking action. Ten
months isn't long enough for action on
such a simple proposal? The Board
agrees with NOW in that there should
be a formal policy, but the question is
when. When will they decide to
comply with the law?

Intellectual Isolation?
Editor:
Larry Diamond's recent editorial on
low campus awareness (Daily, Jan. 31)
annoyed me because it propounded a
narrow outlook supported by
undocumented generalization. He
claimed that "intellectual isolation"
prevails at Stanford, and then
proposed what seems to be a
counter-effective solution, i.e.,
bringing outsiders onto campus.
The real solution to a condition of
isolation is to send students into the
surrounding community in order to
become involved in all aspects of life,
political, cultural, and scientific, etc.
I am interested to know what
justified Mr. Diamond's statement that
"most Stanford students do not have
any regular comprehensive contact
with the news." What criterion does he
use to evaluate "comprehensive
contact"? The number of
subscriptions to Newsweek, hours
spent watching Walter Cronkite? I
would expect a student of political
organizational behavior to be more
rigorous in his choice of crucial issues
and parameters used to evaluate the
issues.
The most serious misconception in
the article was the assumption that
awareness consists solely of political
awareness. I suggest that Mr. Diamond
examine the extra-curricular offerings
in other spheres of the university
which are not intimately connected to
politics, but which do also
"profoundly affect our lives and those
of our children." It ought to become
quickly evident that there is more
stimulation of a well-balanced nature
than any individual has time to take
advantage of experiencing.
I concur with Mr. Diamond's
request to see Stanford become a
national center for intellectual debate;
however, I do not feel that criticizing
discussion outside the classroom will
demonstrate the desirability for
notable speakers. Social improvement
does not result from a great number of
people being able to speak fluently on
political issues; it is a consequence of
enlightened goals achieved by
dedicated workers. Public figures can
provide the goals and inspiration, but
the student must implement them by
means of professional competence, not
by means of verbal virtuosity.

the nation's political left wants Nixon
impeached on policy matters.
Democrats are not purposely denying
the 1972 "mandate" of Nixon's
policies; the Congress is caught
between trying to resolve Watergate
and enacting new legislation.
Conceivably, Nixon could be
impeached for any action deemed a
high crime or misdemeanor by the
House and Senate. However, according
to Supreme Court Justice William
Rehnquist, the Supreme Court could
still rule that the alleged offense was
not impeachable under the U.S.
Constitution. Also, a bipartisan
Congress makes a policy impeachment
unlikely.
The American people do need a
definitive statement of specific charges
against Nixon as well as a list of
impeachable offenses.
Mr. Nixon's resignation will not
resolve the question of his involvement
in Watergate. Since Mr. Nixon is
innocent until proven guilty, only a
House vote, currently planned for
April 30 at the latest, will determine
the boundaries of Nixon's alleged
culpability.
If Nixon's innocence is sustained,
the threat to American government
posed by the presence of ignorant or
inept persons in office will have been

Theta Delt Prank
Editor:
I am writing to express my
contempt for the actions of the
fraternity (Theta Delta Chi, I believe)
which took place in Meyer Library on
the night of 22 January. As an
initiation prank, members of the
fraternity forced a student to remove
his clothes in the third-floor bathroom
and leave the library, having only a
paper towel to cover himself.
This was my first contact with a
Stanford fraternity, and I was grossly
disappointed. This is supposed to be
an academic community, not a nudist
colony. The function of a fraternity
should be to strengthen the academic
atmosphere, not destroy it.
High school was the time for
childish games, but by the time we
reach Stanford, we should be mature
enough to function as decent citizens
in society. It is obvious that these
students have not yet achieved that
stage of maturity. Not only did they
disrupt an atmosphere conducive to
study in the library, but they offended
quite a few people. (I personally know
of two who were* offended by the
spectacle.)
In conclusion, I would like to make
a recommendation regarding methods
to insure that this type of activity does
not continue. I understand that the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity was
suspended from campus last year for a
similar offense. It is my suggestion
that this action, or one comparable, be
taken by the University against the
fraternity responsible for this
immature antic.

Sexism in P. A. Schools
Editoj:
The decision makers of the Palo
Alto Board of Education were asked
to support the law and they evaded
the issue. Perhaps it is better to say
they were afraid to commit themselves
on any formal policy eliminating the
illegal practice of sexism presently
being taught within the school district.
Last Tuesday, the Palo Alto
Chapter of NOW presented a 3-part
proposal for vote by the board: 1)

adopt a resolution formally stating
their intent to comply with the law
prohibiting sex discrimination in the
schools; 2) state exactly when
information will go to the students
and parents stating that all courses in
Home Management and Industrial
ARts shall be open to all students
regardless of sex; and 3) when will
NOW receive the promised drafts of
the catalog and curriculum guideline
changes.
The administrators of the school
district have had the proposal both in
written form, spelled out in detail, and
verbally for the past ten months.
Nothing but promises have been given.
An opportunity for action was
provided Tuesday and again only
promises from the Board — the very
body which makes decisions regarding
policy.
Delay tactics in the form of
"procedure" took precedence over
action and the Board delayed any
further discussion from the audience
regarding this issue until the next
meeting. They must review the
proposal before taking action. Ten
months isn't long enough for action on
such a simple proposal? The Board
agrees with NOW in that there should
be a formal policy, but the question is
when. When will they decide to
comply with the law?

Intellectual Isolation?
Editor:
Larry Diamond's recent editorial on
low campus awareness (Daily, Jan. 31)
annoyed me because it propounded a
narrow outlook supported by
undocumented generalization. He
claimed that "intellectual isolation"
prevails at Stanford, and then
proposed what seems to be a
counter-effective solution, i.e.,
bringing outsiders onto campus.
The real solution to a condition of
isolation is to send students into the
surrounding community in order to
become involved in all aspects of life,
political, cultural, and scientific, etc.
I am interested to know what
justified Mr. Diamond's statement that
"most Stanford students do not have
any regular comprehensive contact
with the news." What criterion does he
use to evaluate "comprehensive
contact"? The number of
subscriptions to Newsweek, hours
spent watching Walter Cronkite? I
would expect a student of political
organizational behavior to be more
rigorous in his choice of crucial issues
and parameters used to evaluate the
issues.
The most serious misconception in
the article was the assumption that
awareness consists solely of political
awareness. I suggest that Mr. Diamond
examine the extra-curricular offerings
in other spheres of the university
which are not intimately connected to
politics, but which do also
"profoundly affect our lives and those
of our children." It ought to become
quickly evident that there is more
stimulation of a well-balanced nature
than any individual has time to take
advantage of experiencing.
I concur with Mr. Diamond's
request to see Stanford become a
national center for intellectual debate;
however, I do not feel that criticizing
discussion outside the classroom will
demonstrate the desirability for
notable speakers. Social improvement
does not result from a great number of
people being able to speak fluently on
political issues; it is a consequence of
enlightened goals achieved by
dedicated workers. Public figures can
provide the goals and inspiration, but
the student must implement them by
means of professional competence, not
by means of verbal virtuosity.

Democrats are not purposely denying
the 1972 "mandate" of Nixon's
policies; the Congress is caught
between trying to resolve Watergate
and enacting new legislation.
Conceivably, Nixon could be
impeached for any action deemed a
high crime or misdemeanor by the
House and Senate. However, according
to Supreme Court Justice William
Rehnquist, the Supreme Court could
still rule that the alleged offense was
not impeachable under the U.S.
Constitution. Also, a bipartisan
Congress makes a policy impeachment
unlikely.
The American people do need a
definitive statement of specific charges
against Nixon as well as a list of
impeachable offenses.
Mr. Nixon's resignation will not
resolve the question of his involvement
in Watergate. Since Mr. Nixon is
innocent until proven guilty, only a
House vote, currently planned for
April 30 at the latest, will determine
the boundaries of Nixon's alleged
culpability.
If Nixon's innocence is sustained,
the threat to American government
posed by the presence of ignorant or
inept persons in office will have been
effectively demonstrated.

Theta Delt Prank
Editor:
I am writing to express my
contempt for the actions of the
fraternity (Theta Delta Chi, I believe)
which took place in Meyer Library on
the night of 22 January. As an
initiation prank, members of the
fraternity forced a student to remove
his clothes in the third-floor bathroom
and leave the library, having only a
paper towel to cover himself.
This was my first contact with a
Stanford fraternity, and I was grossly
disappointed. This is supposed to be
an academic community, not a nudist
colony. The function of a fraternity
should be to strengthen the academic
atmosphere, not destroy it.
High school was the time for
childish games, but by the time we
reach Stanford, we should be mature
enough to function as decent citizens
in society. It is obvious that these
students have not yet achieved that
stage of maturity. Not only did they
disrupt an atmosphere conducive to
study in the library, but they offended
quite a few people. (I personally know
of two who were* offended by the
spectacle.)
In conclusion, I would like to make
a recommendation regarding methods
to insure that this type of activity does
not continue. I understand that the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity was
suspended from campus last year for a
similar offense. It is my suggestion
that this action, or one comparable, be
taken by the University against the
fraternity responsible for this
immature antic.

Sexism in P. A. Schools
Editoj:
The decision makers of the Palo
Alto Board of Education were asked
to support the law and they evaded
the issue. Perhaps it is better to say
they were afraid to commit themselves
on any formal policy eliminating the
illegal practice of sexism presently
being taught within the school district.
Last Tuesday, the Palo Alto
Chapter of NOW presented a 3-part
proposal for vote by the board: 1)

adopt a resolution formally stating
their intent to comply with the law
prohibiting sex discrimination in the
schools; 2) state exactly when
information will go to the students
and parents stating that all courses in
Home Management and Industrial
ARts shall be open to all students
regardless of sex; and 3) when will
NOW receive the promised drafts of
the catalog and curriculum guideline
changes.
The administrators of the school
district have had the proposal both in
written form, spelled out in detail, and
verbally for the past ten months.
Nothing but promises have been given.
An opportunity for action was
provided Tuesday and again only
promises from the Board — the very
body which makes decisions regarding
policy.
Delay tactics in the form of
"procedure" took precedence over
action and the Board delayed any
further discussion from the audience
regarding this issue until the next
meeting. They must review the
proposal before taking action. Ten
months isn't long enough for action on
such a simple proposal? The Board
agrees with NOW in that there should
be a formal policy, but the question is
when. When will they decide to
comply with the law?

Intellectual Isolation?
Editor:
Larry Diamond's recent editorial on
low campus awareness (Daily, Jan. 31)
annoyed me because it propounded a
narrow outlook supported by
undocumented generalization. He
claimed that "intellectual isolation"
prevails at Stanford, and then
proposed what seems to be a
counter-effective solution, i.e.,
bringing outsiders onto campus.
The real solution to a condition of
isolation is to send students into the
surrounding community in order to
become involved in all aspects of life,
political, cultural, and scientific, etc.
I am interested to know what
justified Mr. Diamond's statement that
"most Stanford students do not have
any regular comprehensive contact
with the news." What criterion does he
use to evaluate "comprehensive
contact"? The number of
subscriptions to Newsweek, hours
spent watching Walter Cronkite? I
would expect a student of political
organizational behavior to be more
rigorous in his choice of crucial issues
and parameters used to evaluate the
issues.
The most serious misconception in
the article was the assumption that
awareness consists solely of political
awareness. I suggest that Mr. Diamond
examine the extra-curricular offerings
in other spheres of the university
which are not intimately connected to
politics, but which do also
"profoundly affect our lives and those
of our children." It ought to become
quickly evident that there is more
stimulation of a well-balanced nature
than any individual has time to take
advantage of experiencing.
I concur with Mr. Diamond's
request to see Stanford become a
national center for intellectual debate;
however, I do not feel that criticizing
discussion outside the classroom will
demonstrate the desirability for
notable speakers. Social improvement
does not result from a great number of
people being able to speak fluently on
political issues; it is a consequence of
enlightened goals achieved by
dedicated workers. Public figures can
provide the goals and inspiration, but
the student must implement them by
means of professional competence, not
by means of verbal virtuosity.
