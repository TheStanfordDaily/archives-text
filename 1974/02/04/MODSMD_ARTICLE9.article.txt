# Response To Packard
## Corporate Role In University Affairs 
### 
Gregory Davis

In a Jan. 30 Daily ariicle, David Packard, an
influential conservative member of this nation's
corporate establishment and the number-two
civilian official in the Defense Department during
the first Nixon administration, when aerial
bombardment of civilians in Vietnam reached
staggering proportions, expressed his views on
corporate financial support of American
universities.
It was certainly not surprising to read that
Packard, an important ex-member of the first Nixon
"team," stated that universities "should not criticize
the System on an active basis." Watergate showed
the depths of paranoia of Nixon and his entourage
concerning criticism and dissent in the United States
and their willingness to resort even to illegal acts to
subvert the electoral process and violate the rights
of individual citizens.
Similarly, when Packard said corporations should
earmark their contributions to universities to
support the "right kind of professors" and to
strengthen higher education in specific
"pro-business areas" instead of making unrestricted
grants to benefit the university as a whole, this is
exactly what we would expect from a Nixon
advisor.
If Nixon can use the powers of the Presidency to
help corporations exploit Americans (the
Administration's connivance with ITT and the oil
companies are two good examples), why shouldn't
corporations fashion higher education to serve their
own ends whenever possible? Just as the people are
supposed to serve the corporations, so should the
University.
New Buildings
Packard and the corporate establishment have
already succeeded in this respect. A quick glance at
the newer buildings at Stanford is a good indicator
of the kind of interests the University presently
promotes most actively ~ aerospace, business,

electronics, computer sciences, etc. Stanford's
Board of Trustees has traditionally been dominated
by corporate officers.
Packard's justification for corporate warping of
the traditional university role of serving truth and
the whole society instead of particular interests is
heavily buttressed with fantasy and false
assumptions. For example, Packard stated corporate
donors should favor departments which contribute
to the "free enterprise system."
Does Packard mean by this an economy where
railroads, defense industries, corporate farmers,
airlines, and merchant shipping receive government
subsidies and handouts amounting to tens of billions
of dollars every year? Where prices are administered
(at ever-higher levels) rather than set by market
factors? Where consumer demand is "created" by
the most massive propaganda of waste the world has
ever known? Where small companies are swallowed
up by giant conglomerates while the Justice
Department closes its eyes? And where billionaire
oil firms are excused from paying a fair share of
taxeS? •»
The only things which are "free" in our
economic system are the massive government
handouts to corporations at taxpayer expense — a
kind of socialism for the rich.
Philanthropy?
In a like manner, corporate donations to
universities are considered by Packard and others to
be "philanthropy," as if they were motivated by the
disinterested largesse of the donors.
Universities train technicians, engineers,
scientists, and managers (primarily in the Law and
Business schools) essential to corporations.
Universities do research in various areas which
directly benefit corporations, including electronics,
chemistry, physics, computers, weaponry, behavior
control technology, etc. In addition, universities
socialize graduates along lines favorable to

corporations, inculcating the ideology of "free
enterprise," competitiveness for its own sake, and
the quantitative goals of profit and
Corporate gifts to universities are not philanthropy,
but purchased licenses to influence and control
educational activities essential to corporations.
Stockholder Influence
Packard also wants us to believe that
corporations make gifts "on behalf of their
stockholders." Surely the myth of any meaningful
stockholder influence on the decisions of corporate
boards or any real corporate concert
stockholder wishes was laid to rest by unsu
attempts in recent years of shareholder gr

meaningless charades to give a cc
impression. David Packard's stockholder
member of another "silent majority," for whic
time it is Packard and not Nixon or Agnew
claims to speak.
David Packard may actually believe these m>
or he may merely be cynically mouthing th
because they serve to mystify people and prom
his own interests. But in any case, he favc
corporations' using their wealth and power to or
the University's personnel and programs to i
their own ends. This is exactly what it mean:
"politicize" the university, and Mr. Packard she
not complain when those who perceive that
interests of the American people are not bi
served by such action respond. More and mo
people are beginning to realize that what is good *
the corporations may not be good for America.
