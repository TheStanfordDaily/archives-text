# Nixon Announces Plans For $304 Billion Budget

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon sent to Congress yesterday a
$304.4 billion budget designed to
balance the economy between the
pitfalls of persistent inflation and
rising unemployment.
As he signed the document at the
White House before sending it to the
Capitol, Nixon said the budget would
"not add to the fires of inflation."
Federal spending in fiscal 1975
would be equivalent to about $1500
for every man, woman and child in
America.
The budget provides for a deficit of
$9.4 billion and includes increased
spending for defense, energy resaerch,
transportation and economic-security
programs.
Project Independence
Nixon said it includes Project
Independence, "to reestablish our
capability for self-sufficiency in
energy."
"I plan federal funding of $10
billion for the accelerated energy
research and development component
of this program over the next five
years," he said.
Nixon's 1975 budget proposes to
spend some $1.6 million on energy
research and development, an increase
of $650 million or 69 percent over
fiscal 1974, including a $461 million
"special allowance" to speed up
energy research.
The President also asked Congress

for authority to spend more money on
defense in fiscal 1975 than in any
single year since World War 11.
The $85.8-billion spending request
for the coming fiscal year tops 1945,
when the $79.9 billion spent was the
largest ever for America's non-nuclear
armed forces.
Despite the record total, Nixon said
in his 1975 budget proposal that
unchecked inflation, the energy crisis
and the rising costs of the volunteer
army make the new budget an austere
one. Current dollars greatly inflated
from 1945 dollars, support a
two-million-man military while the
war-year force numbered about 12
million men.
'High Employment'
"In the face of economic
uncertainty," the President told
Congress, "my budget
recommendations provide for a fiscal
policy that would support high
employment while restraining
inflation."
But if the balancing act fails,
whether because of the energy
shortage or other reasons, the
administration made clear it would
prefer higher prices to sharply higher
unemployment.
"The President will not tolerate a
recession," Deputy Budget Director
Frederic Malek told reporters. "If it
means busting the budget, he will bust
the budget to keep people from losing
their jobs."

The administration is prepared to
accept a 5.5-percent jobless rate, but
would resort to contingency spending
plans to pump up the economy if
unemployment goes much above that.
$29.8 Billion Increase
The proposed budget for the fiscal
year beginning July 1 compares with
estimated federal spending in the
current fiscal year of $274.7 billion,
an increase of $29.8 billion.
The current year's deficit is
projected at $4.7 billion.
Nixon said about 90 percent of the
increase in 1975 spending would result
from mandatory increases, such as for
higher Social Security payments.
