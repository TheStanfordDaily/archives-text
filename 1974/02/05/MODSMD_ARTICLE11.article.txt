# Emeriti Housing On Row
## Planners Ignore Student Sentiment 
### 
Eric Hemel

During the last several years it has become the
popular consensus at Stanford that students should
play an important part in the University's
decision-making processes, though much lip service
is paid to this ideal, however, insufficient attention
is paid to it in practice.
The handling of the decision to construct a 100
unit Senior Faculty/Emeriti housing project on the
Old Stanford Elementary School site indicates that
when the stakes are large, University planners will
choose to ignore student sentiment.
At every important step by which the decision
was made to build faculty housing on the Row,
student input was ignored. In November, 1968, the
decision that the site to be developed for emeriti
housing would be the Row was made by the
faculty/staff housing subcommittee, a group
containing no student members.
The subcommittee approved the site even though
there wasn't a single feasibility study of the other
13 sites available for the project. The
subcommittee's approval of the Row site thus
amounted to little more than a rubber stamping,
made without adequate information on other sites
or any pretense of student input.
Subcommittee Motion
Earlier in the decision making process, in
November, 1966, the faculty/staff housing
subcommittee paused a motion stating "no
committments for use of the site will be made
without further consultation with the Stanford
Campus Homeowner's Association." Throughout
the next seven years the Homeowner's Association
was frequently consulted on the site decision and on
other matters pertaining to the housing project, and
was given ex-officio status on the subcommittee in
May, 1973.

No similar attempt was made to solicit advice
from student residents of the Row, although it is
students on the Row who will be most affected by
the project. As though to add insult to injury, the
University agreed to finally give students
representation on the housing subcommittee
beginning this February sth, now that the
subcommittee's role in site selection for the project
is apparently over.
Few Students Concerned?
Robert Augsburger, Stanford's Vice President of
Business and Finance, believes that until recently
few students were concerned with the site selection
issue, which explains why they played no part in the
decision. He claims that developments concerning
the site selection were widely publicized, and that
students failed to respond.
What he fails to consider is that developments
concerning the site selection were announced in the
Campus Report, a publication which labels itself a
"faculty and staff" newspaper, and which rarely
finds its way into the hands of students.
Augsburger acknowledges that no attempts were
made to obtain coverage in the Stanford Daily, the
newspaper most students read. Either by error of
omission, or by deliberate neglect, planners further
squelched student input into the site selection
process by concealing the issue's existence.
Important Questions
Had students been present when the various steps
in the site selection been made, all as of yet
unanswered by administration planners. Among
them are:
1.) Why weren't feasibility studies performed for
the other sites originally considered for the project?
How can planners have objectively chosen between
various sites if a cost analysis was made for only one

of them, the Row site?
2.) How will dense housing development alter the
unique student life style the Row now affords? Will
the presence on the Row of emeriti professors with
their need for quiet, hinder the continuation of such
events as the Row Street Dance, with its
accompanying noise? Will the traffic accompanying
100 new housing units interfere with the semi-rustic
quality the Row presently possesses?
3.) Will a multi-storied apartment complex
interfere with the architectural uniqueness of the
Row?
4.) Is the development of the Row site
compatible with the University land use policy?
That policy states in part that "only a few
institutions, including Stanford, still offer some
breathing space. Most take on the character of dense
urban developments with precious internal campus
open space being consumed by necessary physical
expansion." Won't the building of 100 housing units
on the Row site further consume our "precious
internal campus open space" at Stanford?
Until these questions are resolved, student
dissatisfaction with the selection of the Row site for
the faculty housing project will persist. What is in
question is not the need for emeriti housing, but
whether the selection of the Row site serves the
interests of either the faculty or the Row student
community.
In past speeches, Stanford administrators have
emphasized the need for student input into
University decision-making. The way those same
administrators respond to student feeling on this
issue will be the litmus test of their sincerity.

was made to build faculty housing on the Row,
student input was ignored. In November, 1968, the
decision that the site to be developed for emeriti
housing would be the Row was made by the
faculty/staff housing subcommittee, a group
containing no student members.
The subcommittee approved the site even though
there wasn't a single feasibility study of the other
13 sites available for the project. The
subcommittee's approval of the Row site thus
amounted to little more than a rubber stamping,
made without adequate information on other sites
or any pretense of student input.
Subcommittee Motion
Earlier in the decision making process, in
November, 1966, the faculty/staff housing
subcommittee paused a motion stating "no
committments for use of the site will be made
without further consultation with the Stanford
Campus Homeowner's Association." Throughout
the next seven years the Homeowner's Association
was frequently consulted on the site decision and on
other matters pertaining to the housing project, and
was given ex-officio status on the subcommittee in
May, 1973.

No similar attempt was made to solicit advice
from student residents of the Row, although it is
students on the Row who will be most affected by
the project. As though to add insult to injury, the
University agreed to finally give students
representation on the housing subcommittee
beginning this February sth, now that the
subcommittee's role in site selection for the project
is apparently over.
Few Students Concerned?
Robert Augsburger, Stanford's Vice President of
Business and Finance, believes that until recently
few students were concerned with the site selection
issue, which explains why they played no part in the
decision. He claims that developments concerning
the site selection were widely publicized, and that
students failed to respond.
What he fails to consider is that developments
concerning the site selection were announced in the
Campus Report, a publication which labels itself a
"faculty and staff" newspaper, and which rarely
finds its way into the hands of students.
Augsburger acknowledges that no attempts were
made to obtain coverage in the Stanford Daily, the
newspaper most students read. Either by error of
omission, or by deliberate neglect, planners further
squelched student input into the site selection
process by concealing the issue's existence.
Important Questions
Had students been present when the various steps
in the site selection been made, all as of yet
unanswered by administration planners. Among
them are:
1.) Why weren't feasibility studies performed for
the other sites originally considered for the project?
How can planners have objectively chosen between
various sites if a cost analysis was made for only one

of them, the Row site?
2.) How will dense housing development alter the
unique student life style the Row now affords? Will
the presence on the Row of emeriti professors with
their need for quiet, hinder the continuation of such
events as the Row Street Dance, with its
accompanying noise? Will the traffic accompanying
100 new housing units interfere with the semi-rustic
quality the Row presently possesses?
3.) Will a multi-storied apartment complex
interfere with the architectural uniqueness of the
Row?
4.) Is the development of the Row site
compatible with the University land use policy?
That policy states in part that "only a few
institutions, including Stanford, still offer some
breathing space. Most take on the character of dense
urban developments with precious internal campus
open space being consumed by necessary physical
expansion." Won't the building of 100 housing units
on the Row site further consume our "precious
internal campus open space" at Stanford?
Until these questions are resolved, student
dissatisfaction with the selection of the Row site for
the faculty housing project will persist. What is in
question is not the need for emeriti housing, but
whether the selection of the Row site serves the
interests of either the faculty or the Row student
community.
In past speeches, Stanford administrators have
emphasized the need for student input into
University decision-making. The way those same
administrators respond to student feeling on this
issue will be the litmus test of their sincerity.

During the last several years it has become the
