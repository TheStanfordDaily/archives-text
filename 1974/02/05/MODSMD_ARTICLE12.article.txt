# Specialization Per Se Not Evil
## Consider Individual Educational Goals 
###

A preprofessional student does not have to
specialize, however, and can achieve a balance
between education in the liberal arts and other areas
without affecting admission to professional graduate
schools.
Setting Goals
What about the goals which have been
mentioned? Many students have problems setting
their goals; even some freshmen become distraught
when no firm plan for their education emerges.
Setting goals is not always — in fact rarely — easy.
Specialization is fine, if it fulfills them. So is study
in the liberal arts.
Here are a couple of possible criteria for resolving
the dilemma: 1) Address yourself to the issue of
whether you like what you are studying. Chances
are, whether specialist or not, if you don't enjoy
what you're doing, you won't profit as much from
it, and your work won't help you as much in
attaining your objectives. 2) how does your choice
of major affect your goals, and how is it affected by
them? Will your studies serve your longer-range
aims? Would concentration in a certain area
enhance your ability to fulfill them? Would you be
better off to seek involvement in many areas of
study?
All this talk about goals can be unsettling. They
are, after all, meant to be a tool to be used toward
fulfillment in our lives. Setting goals is not our
raison d'etre.
Honest Thought
There is additionally no optimal time at which a
student's goals should or can emerge, and no one

The dispute between the advocates of education
in the "liberal arts" and persons defending the
virtues of specialization can be a shrill one. The
undergraduate in a technical field may be
stereotyped as someone who spends days in the
library and nights at the computer center. The
student who avoids technical or scientific courses
with equal fervor can be branded equally one-sided.
But the basic issue is more complicated than that
dichotomy illustrates. Several variables which come
into play, one being the goals of that student. My
hypothesis stems from the notion that neither the
specialist nor the "truthie" is better educated; we
need to ask the questions of each: "Have you
thought about and set educational goals for
yourself? If so, how well do your studies meet
them? If not, why not?"
The Stanford undergraduate is also exposed to
many forces on academic direction. Sometimes a
student's friends will influence his or her choice of
major. A family's wishes are often important.
The desire for academic "flexibility" may
engender more confusion than eduation in the mind
of the studnet who has already established relatively
specific goals. In fact, I find that most
undergraduates want to have some direction and
goals and that the student in engineering, chemistry,
or some other area which requires more than the
average number of units is often more comfortable
with his or her education.
In short, while praising flexibility and broad
academic exposure on the one hand, many students
seem not to relish them on the other. Again, the
question of goals arises: "What might be the goals in
my life and hence in my education?"
Erroneous Specialization
Many students preparing for graudate study in
professional schools of business, law, and medicine
feel pressured into early or erroneous specialization.
To be sure, there may be certain courses which are
taken as requirements or recommended background,
but in no case does preprofessional study require
specialization or certain majors.
I find it not surprising that large numbers of
prelaw students major in the social sciences; an
interest in law is likely to be closely allied with
interest and skill in those areas. Similarly, a student
whose aims lead toward the health fields will often
choose to specialize in the natural sciences because
that choice serves both personal and preprofessional
interests.

student should feel embarrassed or guilty if he or
she replies "I don't know" to the inevitable "What
do you want to do?" The most important point:
students should be able to say honestly to
themselves that they are giving thought to their
education.
To that end, the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies has published A Stanford
Education, a book which is now in the hands of
every undergraduate. The provocative essays in that
book treat the major issues which confront students
in makng educational decisions, and we urge every
student to read and reread that potent collection of
thoughts.
Specialization per se is not evil. Neither is a
broader education. Either one can be a poor choice,
depending on how the choice affects the student
and his or her educational aims. Regardless of which
direction is chosen, students should seek as much
information as possible, examine honestly their own
feelings, and then, unfettered as possible by others'
expectations, make a cogent decision.
