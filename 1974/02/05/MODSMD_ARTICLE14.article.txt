# Electric Cycle Developed

### PAUL YEUELL 
» With gasoline prices
skyrocketing, inventors have
plenty of incentive to work
towards a solution to the
transportation problem. An
electric motorcycle has been
developed by an independent
innovator, Roy Kaylor, Menlo
Park, with his Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering.
Several years ago, during a
coast-to-coast polution-free auto
race, Kaylor made a vow. "I
vowed to develop a practical
electric vehicle," says Kaylor.
"The electric motorcycle is the
first step."
There is already one electric
motorcycle on the market,
manufactured by a Southern
California company. Kaylor sells
these from his store in Menlo
Park. However, this motorcycle
has poor acceleration and is small,
about the size of a mini-bike.
The motorcycle that Kaylor
developed has a full-size frame
and a powerful motor. "It will
beat any car off the line up to 40
mph," says Kaylor.
In fact, his motorcycle will
accelerate from zero to 30 mph in
two and a half seconds. Kaylor
claims that his bike will beat a
Honda 750 cc, one of the top
commercial gasoline bikes, in a
drag race.
• fHowever, Kaylor's motorcycle
can go no faster than 50 mph.
"But," insists Kaylor, "that's as
fast as anything can [lawfully] go
these days."

Director of Plant Services Dan
DeYoung, the man responsible for
bringing the "Energy Buggies" to
the campus, is skeptical about
electric motorcycles. "What we
don't need is more motorcycles,"
he says, "especially slow ones on
the freeway."
Kaylor insists that the electric
motorcycle is a viable solution to
the problems of local driving, not
long-distance freeway traveling,
because his electric motorcycle
can go only 50 miles per charge.
The owner merely plugs his
motorcycle into a standard wall
socket for a recharge.
The remarkable thing is that
this recharge will cost only four
cents on the power bill. This is
equivalent to the power expended
by a standard 1500 watt room
heater running for an hour and a
quarter. "And room heaters," says
DeYoung, "are terribly
inefficient."
The price of a new electric
motorcycle is only slightly higher
than a gasoline motorcycle. As for
maintainance, with fewer moving
parts, replacement costs for the
electric motorcycles are less than
for the non-electric models.
But as yet, Kaylor has not
produced any motorcycles for
marketing, and it will probably be
some time before he will be
marketing them in any quantity.
In the meantime, he fixes
televisions and drags around town
on his own electric motorcycle.
Kaylor graduated from
Stanford in 1964 and went on to

obtain his Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering. Then he went into
the electronics industry and built
up a small business. This year he
sold his business to pursue the
electric vehicle.
"Now that the fuel crisis has
created a great impetus for
innovation in Detroit," says
Kaylor, "W e mav soon see some
impressive products."
"Many of these developments
already exist in the space
program," says Kaylor, "but they
are now much too expensive for
the commercial industry."
With the pressures of the fuel
crisis on the automotive industry,
these developments may sift down
from the space program and other
research areas to help remedy the
plight of the consumer.

GAS PROBLEM—Roy Kay lor's electric motorcycle may be the answer to the gas shortage. Top speed for
the motorcycle is 50 miles per hour.
» With gasoline prices
skyrocketing, inventors have
plenty of incentive to work
towards a solution to the
transportation problem. An
electric motorcycle has been
developed by an independent
innovator, Roy Kaylor, Menlo
Park, with his Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering.
Several years ago, during a
coast-to-coast polution-free auto
race, Kaylor made a vow. "I
vowed to develop a practical
electric vehicle," says Kaylor.
"The electric motorcycle is the
first step."
There is already one electric
motorcycle on the market,
manufactured by a Southern
California company. Kaylor sells
these from his store in Menlo
Park. However, this motorcycle
has poor acceleration and is small,
about the size of a mini-bike.
The motorcycle that Kaylor
developed has a full-size frame
and a powerful motor. "It will
beat any car off the line up to 40
mph," says Kaylor.
In fact, his motorcycle will
accelerate from zero to 30 mph in
two and a half seconds. Kaylor
claims that his bike will beat a
Honda 750 cc, one of the top
commercial gasoline bikes, in a
drag race.
• fHowever, Kaylor's motorcycle
can go no faster than 50 mph.
"But," insists Kaylor, "that's as
fast as anything can [lawfully] go
these days."

Director of Plant Services Dan
DeYoung, the man responsible for
bringing the "Energy Buggies" to
the campus, is skeptical about
electric motorcycles. "What we
don't need is more motorcycles,"
he says, "especially slow ones on
the freeway."
Kaylor insists that the electric
motorcycle is a viable solution to
the problems of local driving, not
long-distance freeway traveling,
because his electric motorcycle
can go only 50 miles per charge.
The owner merely plugs his
motorcycle into a standard wall
socket for a recharge.
The remarkable thing is that
this recharge will cost only four
cents on the power bill. This is
equivalent to the power expended
by a standard 1500 watt room
heater running for an hour and a
quarter. "And room heaters," says
DeYoung, "are terribly
inefficient."
The price of a new electric
motorcycle is only slightly higher
than a gasoline motorcycle. As for
maintainance, with fewer moving
parts, replacement costs for the
electric motorcycles are less than
for the non-electric models.
But as yet, Kaylor has not
produced any motorcycles for
marketing, and it will probably be
some time before he will be
marketing them in any quantity.
In the meantime, he fixes
televisions and drags around town
on his own electric motorcycle.
Kaylor graduated from
Stanford in 1964 and went on to

obtain his Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering. Then he went into
the electronics industry and built
up a small business. This year he
sold his business to pursue the
electric vehicle.
