# 'Recession' May Be Question Of Semantics
## 
### JOHN CUNNIFF News Analysis 
NEW YORK (AP) - For the
present at least, time and
semantics protect from challenge
the President's proclamation that
"there will be no recession in the
United States of America."
It may take six months or so
for enough supporting evidence of
recession to be gathered. And
even then the interpretation of
that data might be questioned.
A similarly strong statement
couldn't have been made about
the rate of unemployment, for
example, because the statistics are
released each month. For the
same reasons it would have been
unwise to make any promises
about inflation.
By definition, however, a
recession is two consecutive
quarters of reduced output, and
that means it would be sometime
in July at the earliest before the
complete evidence would be in.
i . Even that might be rushing
things. The National Bureau of
Economic Research is usually
accorded the honor of making the
declaration, and sometimes it
takes its own good time about
doing so.
Not everyone agrees with the
definition either. It is possible,
they note, for unemployment to
rise and businesses to go bankrupt
and the mood of the nation to
become one of despair while
production expands, if ever so
slightly.
for practical purposes,
many economists make their own
ruling long before the statistical
evidence is in. Albert Cox Jr., a

former Nixon administration
economist and now chief
economist for Lionel D. Edie &
Co., told clients this week:
"A recession probably began in
December. As it deepens and
spreads, unemployment will rise,
demand will shrink, and some
deflationary forces will begin to
work."
While Cox might be unable to
prove his point on the evidence
available now, he is quite sure that
by July his assumption will be
confirmed. This is his forecast of
growth rates for 1974:
First quarter — decline in real
growth of 4.7 percent. Second
quarter — decline of 1 percent.
Thus a recession, but barely.
Thereafter Cox foresees
growing strength, with an
expansion of 2.1 percent in the
third quarter, and a 3.9 percent
advance in the final three months
of the year.
