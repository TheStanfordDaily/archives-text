# Firemen Seek Mutual Aid Pacts
## 
### 
University News Service
Stanford firemen, more given
to action than philosophical
reflection, have already taken
advantage of a new personnel
exchange program still "under
discussion" in other areas of Palo
Alto city and University
administration.
Assistant Chief John Barr is
just back from a week's
observation tour and exchange of
ideas with the Palo Alto Fire
Department.
And the Stanford crew expects
a Palo Alto fireman of equivalent
rank to spend a week or so with
them before the month is out.
Barr, who is also training
officer and head of the
University's bomb disposal and
safety squad, is not as busy in the
latter job as he was during the
"riot and civil commotion" era of
the late '60s.
But his expertise is great
enough for neighboring
departments to seek his help when
the occasion demands.
Mutual Aid
And that phase of fire safety
and prevention work is what
enthused him most about his
recent Palo Alto visit — the
expansion and streamlining of
Stanford's mutual aid agreements
with Palo Alto, Los Altos Hills,
and on occasion Mountain View.
While the official okay hasn't
been put on the new program,
Barr reports, it is highly likely
that it will be in force well before
the high-risk fire season starts.
As it stands now, there are two
areas which concern all three
jurisdictions — the campus
backlands between Foothill
Expressway and Freeway 280,
and College Terrace, Frenchman's
Hill, El Camino Real between
University and Stanford Aves.,
and the Stanford and Town and
Country shopping centers.
"A major fire in any of those
spots concerns all of us," Chief
Barr said, "and it doesn't matter
whose side of the street it's on."
Under the new plan, one
engine from each jurisdiction will

respond automatically to a call in
any of those areas, Barr explained,
there to serve if needed under the
command of the fire officer in
charge.
In this way, the engine at the
scene can radio for additional help
from his own department if
needed, in contrast to the less
efficient system now used in
which members of the aid pact
wait for an assistance call from
the beleaguered department on
the spot.
"This is better fire strategy and
better logistics," Barr said.
Special Course
Another emphasis will be in
the field of emergency first aid
and rescue. Firemen
"paramedics," to qualify for this

work, must take a sb-hour
preparatory course in everything
related to traumatic injury plus a
40-hour refersher course at a
hospital every year to keep up
their skills.
Already 10 Stanford firemen
have taken such a course at San
Jose City College, and 10 more
have signed up for the coming
semester.
'Trauma Van'
The rescue squad may have the
backup services of a "trauma
van," a specially equipped mobile
emergency room which can be
dispatched to the scene of an
emergency with a doctor on
board.
Dr. Ernest Kaplan of Stanford
Medical School, an assistant

professor of surgery, is very
interested in such a vehicle and is
working with Stanford firemen to
obtain one.
Barr is firming up a proposal
which could draw on available
Federal grants for training and
equipment. "We're in good shape
already on the training program,
but we could sure use the
equipment," he said.
Stanford is also looking into
the possibilities of a "command
car" van or heavy-duty station
wagon, possibly four-wheel drive,
which would contain
multichannel radio equipment,
maps, and other gear which could
be used at the scene of a disaster
as mobile headquarters.
