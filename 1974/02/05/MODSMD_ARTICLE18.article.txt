# U.S. Aid Backs Phnom Penh

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -
The $580 million in U.S. funds
earmarked for the Cambodian
government this year is helping
buy time for Phnom Penh, now
under almost daily rocket and
artillery attack, U.S. diplomats
say.
They say the only hope of the
U.S.-backed army of President
Lon Nol is to hold on until the
monsoons begin flooding the
battlefields in about four months.
Last year, U.S. 852 sand
fighter bombers carried the war to
the insurgents. Congress forced an
end to the U.S. combat role in
Indochina last year. Now the
insurgents are carrying the war to
Phnom Penh.
The diplomats expect another
three or four months of artillery
shellings and rocket attacks on
Phnom Penh that already have
killed about 200 and wounded
500 since late December.
Daily Attacks
The almost daily attacks have
obscured any visions of victory by
the Lon Nol government.
If the rebels fail to topple the
regime by June when the heavy
rains begin, there is no reason to

believe they will be any stronger
when the next dry season comes,
the diplomats say.
The rebels are dominated by
Cambodian Communists and
include royalist insurgents.
Standoff
American diplomats think a
standoff could bring the two sides
closer to a coalition government.
The danger to Phnom Penh has
resulted in a flurry of peace
statements from students and
intellectuals and demands that
Lon Nol resign.
The shellings have brought the
war to the doorsteps of Phnom
Penh's people, who in the past
appeared to take little interest in
the fighting in the provinces.
The insurgents are estimated to
have only 18,000 soldiers within a
25-mile radius of the capital,
compared to 50,000 government
troops.
New Fear
When the attacks began Dec.
23, they appeared to arouse little
more than curiosity among
Phnom Penh's residents, who
seemed to feel that anyone who
got hit with a missile must simply
be a victim of bad luck. But now
fear of the shellings and rockets
has mushroomed.

With the increase of attacks,
western sources say the insurgents
have gained a psychological
victory with their ability to shell
the capital.
Cambodian officers along the
Phnom Penh defense perimeter
south of the city say the shelling
is coming from captured
American-made 105 mm howjtzers
as close as six miles to the city.
