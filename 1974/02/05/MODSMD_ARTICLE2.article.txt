# Row Residents, University Shirk Blame For Confusion
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Both untversily ouiciais ana
students are shirking responsibility for
the breakdown in communication
surrounding the construction of the
controversial faculty emeriti housing
project on the Row.
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance, blamed
student members of University
committees for not voicing their
criticisms until too late.
The student body will vote for or
against the project tomorrow and
Thursday in an ASSU referendum.
Augsburger pointed out, "The
referendum is subverting a process that
was not utilized." The student
members of committees supported the
project in past years, Augsburger
attests, and the three members of the
Trustee Land and Building Committee
neglected to attend the Jan. 8 meeting
when the housing project was
approved.
Regardless of these allegations of
student negligence, many say it is the
responsibility of the Planning Office to
publicize their designs and to actively
seek out student opinion.
ASSU Sen. Bill Faught charges
that the Planning Office does not ask
for student input until too late.
Faught speaks from experience as a
leader of a strike which threatened last
year over high rents in Escondido
Village.
Sensitivity A Goal
University Master Planner Oscar
Nelson explained that a goal of the
Planning Office is to be "sensitive to
the needs of the Stanford
community."
The office contacted prospective
residents for the complex in extensive
surveys and consulted the Stanford
Campus Homeowners' Association five
times in the last two years. However,
there is no record of direct
consultations with Row residents.
Plans for the housing project began as
early as 1964, Nelson said.
Since then the Planning Office has
dropped the proposal to phase out the
"ol u student residences, because
there has been an increasing demand
for space in them, according to
Nelson.
Asked if various committees
working on the emeriti complex had
re-evaluated the construction site in
light of recent student protest, Bob
Summers, manager of faculty-staff
housing said, "I don't know. Yes T
think so. But the issue could have been
raised by students on the
committees."
Possible Friction
Many Row residents complain that
the emeriti apartments may cause
"friction" between older, retired
faculty and students in the area
resulting from "conflicting life styles
and noise levels."
Grove residents point to complaints
about noise by faculty who already

live in the area. Emeriti faculty, they
may be even more sensitive
living so clost to students.
People who object to the noise level
and to living in close proximity with
students shouldn't move into the
complex, Nelson said.
He added that the architects can
take soundproofing into consideration
when they design the project.
Questions Raised
Students, joined by one faculty
member, raised questions about the
architecture in an open ASSU Senate
forum held last Thursday.
"How can any 100 unit complex,
complete with parking and
recreational facilities not ruin the
appearance of the Row?" Jim Friend,

ASSU vice-president said.
Summers said the architecture
would blend in with the traditional
appearance of the Row, and that
special care would be taken not to
disturb the eucalyptus trees bordering
the site.
The architecture will influence the
project's economic success, Summers
said. A study last spring revealed that
rents may have to be higher than
anticipated and footage reduced in
order to make the complex
economically feasible.
He declined to give "specific
details" due to the "sensitive" nature
of contract negotiations, but
cautioned that his findings were only
preliminary.
