# Comedy And Brutality In 'Black Belt Jones'
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
Directed by Robert Clouse, and with Jim Kelly in the title role,<
Black Belt Jones is a Los Angeles-based film reminiscent in
and structure of the motorcycle movies of 1965-66. Laced
vapid acting and over-worked dialogue, it is a low-budget escapade'
of a young black crime-fighter's encounter with the Mafia.
Although the film is intended, according to several of
promotional blurbs, to be an "action drama," Black Belt Jones is<
essentially comic in nature. There are several scenes
karate (at which Jones is supposedly an expert) that, due to
photography and direction, border on a kind of slapstick not
unlike the Three Stooges. In one scene, for example, Jones and a
friend apply various karate techniques to a few Mafia henchmen<
by trapping them in a dark room that is systematically lit and*
darkened in three-second intervals. ,
As the intruders are rather brutally beaten, the undercurrent of
dialogue between them transforms the situation into a kind of
cartoon pie-throw. Much of the violence in the film adheres f .o this'
type of staged head-cracking which is not quite realistic enough to*
be taken seriously and yet not quite clever enough to be laughable.*
Because the plot line of Black Belt Jones is intricate and,
ridiculous, the film must depend on its fast pace to keep audience (
interest and involvement. With only an occasional well-placed
1 one-liner to punctuate the otherwise uninspired dialogue between"
' fights, the film is an ill-spent ninety-minute adventure into"
, B-movies. One brawl pointlessly follows another, identical except)
for various gimmicks and shifts in setting from pool rooms to,
railroad cars and the final sudsy parking lot of a broken
' Aside from an adequate score and a fair amount

\ Jones is the film's use of sound effects. If the tone of the film is in'
,any way suspenseful, it is due not to what the audience observes,(
( but rather to what it hears. In a way, the film's R rating can be,
traced to its implied force through sound effects and dialogical,
threats rather than to its visual import as a moving picture.

I that constantly occurs between these poles comes when Jones,

Directed by Robert Clouse, and with Jim Kelly in the title role,<
Black Belt Jones is a Los Angeles-based film reminiscent in
and structure of the motorcycle movies of 1965-66. Laced
vapid acting and over-worked dialogue, it is a low-budget escapade'
of a young black crime-fighter's encounter with the Mafia.
Although the film is intended, according to several of
promotional blurbs, to be an "action drama," Black Belt Jones is<
essentially comic in nature. There are several scenes
karate (at which Jones is supposedly an expert) that, due to
photography and direction, border on a kind of slapstick not
unlike the Three Stooges. In one scene, for example, Jones and a
friend apply various karate techniques to a few Mafia henchmen<
by trapping them in a dark room that is systematically lit and*
darkened in three-second intervals. ,
As the intruders are rather brutally beaten, the undercurrent of
dialogue between them transforms the situation into a kind of
cartoon pie-throw. Much of the violence in the film adheres f .o this'
type of staged head-cracking which is not quite realistic enough to*
be taken seriously and yet not quite clever enough to be laughable.*
