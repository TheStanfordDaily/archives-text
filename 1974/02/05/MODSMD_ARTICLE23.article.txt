# 'Adversary' Portrays Indian Youth
## 
### LAURIE LUCAS SRI KRISHN CHOPRA 
"What was the most significant
event of the last decade?" the
interview panel asks Siddhartha
Chaudary, the hero of Satyajit
Ray's Pratidwandi (The
Adversary), screened by the India
Association Jan. 25 in Bishop
Auditorium.
"The Vietnam War," replies
Siddhartha, a 25 year-old medical
school dropout in search of a job.
"Not the landing on the
moon?" asks one of the
interviewers. Although the movie
is in Bengali, the interview is
conducted in English. The flawless
English of Siddhartha and his
interviewers mark them as
members of the English-speaking
elite of Indian society.
"No .. . because while the
landing on the moon was
expected, the Vietnam war
brought out the unexpected . ..
the plain, human courage of a
fearless people against the forces

of oppression. ..."
Siddhartha is interrupted, "Are
you a Communist?"
"You don't have to be a
Communist to admire the courage
of the Vietnamese!" Siddhartha
sneers, his large, penetrating eyes
flashing with scorn. A political
activist in college, he has been
forced to abandon his medical
career upon his father's death.
Siddhartha's cynical retorts
baffle his interviewers, who
dismiss him. His job pursuits
continue, but to no avail. A
divided sense of morality
torments him.
He is sickened by the
hypocrisy of the establishment,
the corruption that engulfs the
entire society. Yet he knows he
must melt into the system he
abhors. This dilemma of bright,
middle-class youth growing up in
modern India reflects the conflicts
of American youth as well.
For Siddhartha, finding a job

becomes especially important
because his sister Topu, a
beautiful, fun-loving, Westernized
girl, is employed. However,
Siddhartha suspects that her boss
has more than an employer's
interest in her.
This, in itself, is contrary to
the established mores of Indian
society. But, once again, despite
elaborate schemes to avenge his
sister's lecherous boss (I'll throw a
bomb at him") Siddhartha finds
himself incapable of action.
Younger Brother
At the other extreme from
Topu, the hedonistic sybarite, is
Siddhartha's younger brother, a
college student and an active
revolutionary. In the late sixties
and early seventies, Calcutta was
torn by the Marxist-Leninist Party
(Naxalite) riots. Much like their
counterparts on American
campuses, college students in
Calcutta spearheaded mass street
and campus violence.
Trapped between a militant

brother de*~:"~Mned to destroy the
decadent per-class, and a
selfish, pleasure-loving sister,
Siddhartha turns to his peers for
an alternative life-style.
But all they offer him are the
touted wonders of sex, which
sicken him even more. An uncut
Swedish movie turns him off. So
do the ministrations of a nurse
introduced to him by a
well-meaning friend: "She is all
yours now for a good time."
Disgusted with the vices that
surround him — one of his
medical college friends has taken
to stealing Red Cross funds —
Siddhartha dreams of becoming a
revolutionary. "But you don't
have the courage to get out and
become a revolutionary," chides a
political friend. "You belong to
the category who thinks but
cannot do."
Siddhartha, is, in fact,
representative of the middle-class
Indian youth who are subjected to
such opposing social forces that
"they think, but cannot do." This
seems to be true for the American
youth too; only the nature of the
social forces are different.
Ray's Appeal
All Ray's movies are distinctive
in this universal appeal. Their
setting is urban Bengal and his
characters are Bengalis mired in
the conflicts of Bengali society.
But with his characteristic,
heart-warming simplicity of theme
and treatment, Ray always makes
his characters' conflicts mirror
everyone's torment.
"In this movie too,"
commented an Indian student
from Madras, who doesn't
understand a word of Bengali,
"the characters are all real life
people you come across anywhere
in India."
Anywhere in the world would
perhaps be equally accurate.
Americans recognize the
characters in The Adversary just
as well, whether it is the father of
Siddhartha's sweetheart who
laments "What is happening to the

youth today? What do they know
about relationships?" or a group
of Indian med students devouring
Playboy.
The black and white,
photography adds to the realism
of the movie. Calcutta is shown in"
all its splendour and squalor —
complete with riots, the Victoria
Memorial, street beggars, the posh
Park Street, slums and American"
tourists.
Siddhartha looks away as a
band of hippies spout the familiar
cliche in an old temple: "This is
where the world started. This i$
where the magic is." Yet, there is
something indescribably beautiful
in this melange of contrasts, in
what many Westerners have
deemed "the worst city in the
world."
'Rotten City'
Siddhartha, like most
Calcuttans, is in love with "this
rotten city" and would not leave
it for anything. But in the end, h<?
must give it up. Calcutta does not
have a job for him.
The buildup of the climactic
scenes unites the viewer
completely with the movie
characters without ever making
him tense; such is Ray's
consummate directorial skill.
Numerous flashbacks, dream
sequences, negative shots, minute
details — such as a pail of cigarette
butts in the waiting room, or the
skirmishes for the limited number
of chairs outside the interview
room, show the perfectionist in
Ray.
A Bengali in the audience
complained about inaccurate
translations of Bengali dialogues
in American English sub-titles.
Retorted an American fan of Ray,
"Maybe. But that doesn't make
any difference to me. I think the
true greatness of a Ray movie is
that you understand every bit of
it without knowing a word of
Bengali."

career upon his father's death.
Siddhartha's cynical retorts
baffle his interviewers, who
dismiss him. His job pursuits
continue, but to no avail. A
divided sense of morality
torments him.
He is sickened by the
hypocrisy of the establishment,
the corruption that engulfs the
entire society. Yet he knows he
must melt into the system he
abhors. This dilemma of bright,
middle-class youth growing up in
modern India reflects the conflicts
of American youth as well.
For Siddhartha, finding a job

becomes especially important
because his sister Topu, a
beautiful, fun-loving, Westernized
girl, is employed. However,
Siddhartha suspects that her boss
has more than an employer's
interest in her.
This, in itself, is contrary to
the established mores of Indian
society. But, once again, despite
elaborate schemes to avenge his
sister's lecherous boss (I'll throw a
bomb at him") Siddhartha finds
himself incapable of action.
Younger Brother
At the other extreme from
Topu, the hedonistic sybarite, is
Siddhartha's younger brother, a
college student and an active
revolutionary. In the late sixties
and early seventies, Calcutta was
torn by the Marxist-Leninist Party
(Naxalite) riots. Much like their
counterparts on American
campuses, college students in
Calcutta spearheaded mass street
and campus violence.
Trapped between a militant

brother de*~:"~Mned to destroy the
decadent per-class, and a
selfish, pleasure-loving sister,
Siddhartha turns to his peers for
an alternative life-style.
But all they offer him are the
touted wonders of sex, which
sicken him even more. An uncut
Swedish movie turns him off. So
do the ministrations of a nurse
introduced to him by a
well-meaning friend: "She is all
yours now for a good time."
Disgusted with the vices that
surround him — one of his
medical college friends has taken
to stealing Red Cross funds —
Siddhartha dreams of becoming a
revolutionary. "But you don't
have the courage to get out and
become a revolutionary," chides a
political friend. "You belong to
the category who thinks but
cannot do."
Siddhartha, is, in fact,
representative of the middle-class
Indian youth who are subjected to
such opposing social forces that
"they think, but cannot do." This
seems to be true for the American
youth too; only the nature of the
social forces are different.
Ray's Appeal
All Ray's movies are distinctive
in this universal appeal. Their
setting is urban Bengal and his
characters are Bengalis mired in
the conflicts of Bengali society.
But with his characteristic,
heart-warming simplicity of theme
and treatment, Ray always makes
his characters' conflicts mirror
everyone's torment.
"In this movie too,"
commented an Indian student
from Madras, who doesn't
understand a word of Bengali,
"the characters are all real life
people you come across anywhere
in India."
Anywhere in the world would
perhaps be equally accurate.
Americans recognize the
characters in The Adversary just
as well, whether it is the father of
Siddhartha's sweetheart who
laments "What is happening to the

youth today? What do they know
about relationships?" or a group
of Indian med students devouring
Playboy.
The black and white,
photography adds to the realism
of the movie. Calcutta is shown in"
all its splendour and squalor —
complete with riots, the Victoria
Memorial, street beggars, the posh
Park Street, slums and American"
tourists.
Siddhartha looks away as a
band of hippies spout the familiar
cliche in an old temple: "This is
where the world started. This i$
where the magic is." Yet, there is
something indescribably beautiful
in this melange of contrasts, in
what many Westerners have
deemed "the worst city in the
world."
'Rotten City'
Siddhartha, like most
Calcuttans, is in love with "this
rotten city" and would not leave
it for anything. But in the end, h<?
must give it up. Calcutta does not
have a job for him.
The buildup of the climactic
scenes unites the viewer
completely with the movie
characters without ever making
him tense; such is Ray's
consummate directorial skill.
Numerous flashbacks, dream
sequences, negative shots, minute
details — such as a pail of cigarette
butts in the waiting room, or the
skirmishes for the limited number
of chairs outside the interview
room, show the perfectionist in
Ray.
A Bengali in the audience
complained about inaccurate
translations of Bengali dialogues
in American English sub-titles.
Retorted an American fan of Ray,
"Maybe. But that doesn't make
any difference to me. I think the
true greatness of a Ray movie is
that you understand every bit of
it without knowing a word of
Bengali."
"What was the most significant
event of the last decade?" the
interview panel asks Siddhartha
Chaudary, the hero of Satyajit
Ray's Pratidwandi (The
Adversary), screened by the India
Association Jan. 25 in Bishop
Auditorium.
"The Vietnam War," replies
Siddhartha, a 25 year-old medical
school dropout in search of a job.
"Not the landing on the
moon?" asks one of the
interviewers. Although the movie
is in Bengali, the interview is
conducted in English. The flawless
English of Siddhartha and his
interviewers mark them as
members of the English-speaking
elite of Indian society.
"No .. . because while the
landing on the moon was
expected, the Vietnam war
brought out the unexpected . ..
the plain, human courage of a
fearless people against the forces

of oppression. ..."
Siddhartha is interrupted, "Are
you a Communist?"
"You don't have to be a
Communist to admire the courage
of the Vietnamese!" Siddhartha
sneers, his large, penetrating eyes
flashing with scorn. A political
activist in college, he has been
forced to abandon his medical
career upon his father's death.
Siddhartha's cynical retorts
baffle his interviewers, who
dismiss him. His job pursuits
continue, but to no avail. A

and early seventies, Calcutta was
torn by the Marxist-Leninist Party
(Naxalite) riots. Much like their
counterparts on American
campuses, college students in
Calcutta spearheaded mass street
and campus violence.
Trapped between a militant

brother de*~:"~Mned to destroy the
decadent per-class, and a
selfish, pleasure-loving sister,
Siddhartha turns to his peers for
an alternative life-style.
But all they offer him are the
touted wonders of sex, which
sicken him even more. An uncut
Swedish movie turns him off. So
do the ministrations of a nurse
introduced to him by a
well-meaning friend: "She is all
yours now for a good time."
Disgusted with the vices that
surround him — one of his
medical college friends has taken
to stealing Red Cross funds —
Siddhartha dreams of becoming a
revolutionary. "But you don't
have the courage to get out and
become a revolutionary," chides a
political friend. "You belong to
the category who thinks but
cannot do."
Siddhartha, is, in fact,
representative of the middle-class
Indian youth who are subjected to
such opposing social forces that
"they think, but cannot do." This
seems to be true for the American
youth too; only the nature of the
social forces are different.
Ray's Appeal
All Ray's movies are distinctive
in this universal appeal. Their
setting is urban Bengal and his
characters are Bengalis mired in
the conflicts of Bengali society.
But with his characteristic,
heart-warming simplicity of theme
and treatment, Ray always makes
his characters' conflicts mirror
everyone's torment.
"In this movie too,"
commented an Indian student
from Madras, who doesn't
understand a word of Bengali,
"the characters are all real life
people you come across anywhere
in India."
Anywhere in the world would
perhaps be equally accurate.
Americans recognize the
characters in The Adversary just
as well, whether it is the father of
Siddhartha's sweetheart who
laments "What is happening to the

youth today? What do they know
about relationships?" or a group
of Indian med students devouring
Playboy.
The black and white,
photography adds to the realism
of the movie. Calcutta is shown in"
all its splendour and squalor —
complete with riots, the Victoria
Memorial, street beggars, the posh
Park Street, slums and American"
tourists.
Siddhartha looks away as a
band of hippies spout the familiar
cliche in an old temple: "This is
where the world started. This i$
where the magic is." Yet, there is
something indescribably beautiful
in this melange of contrasts, in
what many Westerners have
deemed "the worst city in the
world."
'Rotten City'
Siddhartha, like most
Calcuttans, is in love with "this
rotten city" and would not leave
it for anything. But in the end, h<?
must give it up. Calcutta does not
have a job for him.
The buildup of the climactic
scenes unites the viewer
completely with the movie
characters without ever making
him tense; such is Ray's
consummate directorial skill.
Numerous flashbacks, dream
sequences, negative shots, minute
details — such as a pail of cigarette
butts in the waiting room, or the
skirmishes for the limited number
of chairs outside the interview
room, show the perfectionist in
Ray.
A Bengali in the audience
complained about inaccurate
translations of Bengali dialogues
in American English sub-titles.
Retorted an American fan of Ray,
"Maybe. But that doesn't make
any difference to me. I think the
true greatness of a Ray movie is
that you understand every bit of
it without knowing a word of
Bengali."
"What was the most significant
event of the last decade?" the
interview panel asks Siddhartha
Chaudary, the hero of Satyajit
Ray's Pratidwandi (The
Adversary), screened by the India
Association Jan. 25 in Bishop
Auditorium.
"The Vietnam War," replies
Siddhartha, a 25 year-old medical
school dropout in search of a job.
"Not the landing on the
moon?" asks one of the
interviewers. Although the movie
is in Bengali, the interview is
conducted in English. The flawless
English of Siddhartha and his
interviewers mark them as
members of the English-speaking
elite of Indian society.
"No .. . because while the
landing on the moon was
expected, the Vietnam war
brought out the unexpected . ..
the plain, human courage of a
fearless people against the forces

of oppression. ..."
Siddhartha is interrupted, "Are
you a Communist?"
"You don't have to be a
Communist to admire the courage
of the Vietnamese!" Siddhartha
sneers, his large, penetrating eyes
flashing with scorn. A political
activist in college, he has been
forced to abandon his medical
career upon his father's death.
Siddhartha's cynical retorts
baffle his interviewers, who
dismiss him. His job pursuits
continue, but to no avail. A
divided sense of morality
torments him.
He is sickened by the
hypocrisy of the establishment,
the corruption that engulfs the
entire society. Yet he knows he
must melt into the system he
abhors. This dilemma of bright,
middle-class youth growing up in
modern India reflects the conflicts
of American youth as well.
For Siddhartha, finding a job

becomes especially important
because his sister Topu, a
beautiful, fun-loving, Westernized
girl, is employed. However,
Siddhartha suspects that her boss
has more than an employer's
interest in her.
This, in itself, is contrary to
the established mores of Indian
society. But, once again, despite
elaborate schemes to avenge his
sister's lecherous boss (I'll throw a
bomb at him") Siddhartha finds
himself incapable of action.
Younger Brother
At the other extreme from
Topu, the hedonistic sybarite, is
Siddhartha's younger brother, a
college student and an active
revolutionary. In the late sixties
and early seventies, Calcutta was
torn by the Marxist-Leninist Party
(Naxalite) riots. Much like their
counterparts on American
campuses, college students in
Calcutta spearheaded mass street
