# Smooth Tone, Flawless Technique
## Laws: 'Perfect' Jazz Flutist 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
SAN FRANCISCO - Hubert
Laws, winner of the flute
category, in the Downbeat Jazz
Roll for the last three years,
opened a five-night engagement
last Wednesday night at Keystone
Korner and proved to a
jam-packed room that he is
probably the foremost flutist in
jazz today. Not many come close
to his perfection of tone and
technique.
What also made the
performance so enjoyable was the
remarkable support of his group:
Woody Murray, vibes; Mike
Anthony, guitar; Clare Fischer,
piano and electric piano; Jim
Hughart, electric bass; Harvey
Mason, percussion; and brother
Ronnie Laws, reeds.
Laws, using an amplified flute,
began the first number, "Fire and
Rain," with the theme in a
Mozartian vein, the notes seeming
to float from the instrument. A
funky bass line erupted and the
group took off on a rhythmic
flight which featured a violent
vibe solo by Murray as Laws,
shaking a tambourine, watched
admiringly.
Involved In Group
Laws is conscious of his group
and doesn't ignore them when he
has finished his solo; he often
picks up a percussion instrument
and joins in, enjoying the other
musicians as much as the audience
does. Ronnie Laws exhibited
technical mastery on the soprano
sax before the tune ended in an
exhibition of trilled notes and
clean phrasing by Hubert in a
restatement of the theme.
What makes Hubert Laws'
music so distinctive and pleasant
is the merger of old and new,
harmonic and rhythmic elements

in natural balance. His classical
training and jazz experience
combine to create a unique
reflection of his talent.
There is something basic yet
progressive about his music.
Whereas many electronic and
avant garde groups use
disssonance which can provoke a
tense response, Laws, a peaceful

person, believes in the natural law
of harmony. "When you hear one
tone produced, there's a series of
overtones that come into play and
they suggest harmonies . .. and
there's nothing you can do to
destroy that law."
Velvet Tone
"Morning Star" was a vehicle
for Laws' velvet tone and pure
execution and spotlighted
Fischer's subtle electric piano
work. The excellent rhythm
section emerged several times
during the evening to offer
complementary solos.
Throughout the set, Ronnie
Laws exhibited his talent on tenor
and soprano sax, with some

exceptional moments occurring
during the third number,
"Pavane." Anthony's arpeggio
guitar accompaniment set the
mood; Ronnie Laws answered on
soprano sax a statement made by
Hubert in his flawless style which
merged into a very effective duet.
The result was Elizabethan with a
touch of dreamy elegance until

Ronnie switched to tenor and
dueted again with Hubert. The
rhythm then approached a bossa
nova beat and an intensification
that carried it to the finish.
The flute was not used as a jazz
instrument until 20 or so years
ago and Laws, who has recorded
on his own since 1966 and has
been associated with the Quincy
Jones Orchestra and the CTI
Organization, is one of the
definitive jazz musicians on flute.
