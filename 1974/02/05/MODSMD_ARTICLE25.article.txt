Syria Reports Golan Fighting
Syria reported its tanks and cannons traded fire with
Israeli forces in the Golan Heights for two hours yesterday
in the 10th consecutive day of clashes along the jagged
cease-fire line.
The fighting came as Arab newspapers said Syrian
Resident Hafez Assad was winning his campaign to keep up
the oil embargo against the United States until he gets a
Golan troop disengagement pact to his liking.
Newspapers reported yesterday that Assad won firm
pledges from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to continue the
embargo until the Syrians sign the pact with Israel on
Syrian terms.
And Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam said
Syria will settle for nothing less than an Israeli commitment
to "total withdrawal from Arab territories conquered both
in the 1973 and 1967 wars."
Israeli military spokesmen said the clash was confined to
the southeast section of the front and left two Israeli
soldiers wounded. The Israelis have contested earlier Syrian
battle reports as exaggerated.
Truckers To Settle Dispute?
WASHINGTON — Federal-state negotiators and
representatives of striking independent truckers neared a
compromise agreement last night that could send the
truckers back to work, sources close to the talks said.
The sources said the truckers presented government
mediators with an 11-point list of "minimum acceptable
demands" last night, dropping their key demand for a
rollback of diesel fuel prices, which had stalled the talks all
day.
"The government seemed to be amenable to the
proposal," one of the sources said.
Meanwhile violence, food shortages and more layoffs
were reported yesterday in the spreading shutdown of
independent truckers. National Guardsmen were on duty in
three states to try to stop further violence in the
five-day-old protest.
The effects of the strike spread from state to state.
Shootings, tire slashings and other violence were reported in
more than a dozen areas. Schools in several states closed,
meat packing plants sent their employees home; and
produce markets said they were running out of fresh fruits
and vegetables.
Sehultz Urges Oil Profit Tax
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's administration
urged Congress yesterday to enact a tax that would skim
off windfall profits from the big current jumps in crude oil
prices, but phase out if price levels stabilize in coming
years.
y\ Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz, laying the proposal
before the House Ways and Means Committee, took a firm
stand, however, against a roll-back in present crude oil
prices — despite indications from elsewhere in the
administration that such a step may be under study.
, ' Shultz told reporters outside the hearing room he has
the impression oil prices may already have peaked.
to To the committee, he said it was his guess that the day
of very high profits by U.S. companies from overseas
production are about over.
Nixon And Gromyko Meet In D.C.
WASHINGTON — President Nixon and Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko held wide-ranging talks
yesterday, including discussion of "this year's projected
meeting in Moscow" between Nixon and Soviet Communist
party chief Leonid Brezhnev.
The two-hour meeting in Nixon's Oval Office came two
days after sources reported the President's return trip to

Moscow was tentatively scheduled for June,
Deputy press secretary Gerald Warren said Nixon and
the foreign minister "had very useful and extensive and
cordial exchanges of views on major issues of current
interest."
Specifically, he said, the talks ranged over the Middle
East situation, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the
European security conference.
Warren said Cuba was not brought up at the White
House meeting.
Before coming to the White House, Gromyko held a
two-hour session with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Their discussions apparently centered on prospects for
an Israeli-Syrian troop disengagement and East German
pressure on access to West Berlin.
Judge Subpoenas Nixon
LOS ANGELES — President Nixon was officially
subpoenaed yesterday to testify in the Ellsberg burglary
case.
The subpoena, requested by former presidential aide
John D. Ehrlichman, ordered the President to appear in a
Los Angeles courtroom Feb. 25 and again April 15.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer, who ruled that the
President is a material witness in the trial of Ehrlichman
and two other former White House aides, signed the
subpoena. It was the first time in U.S. history that a state
court judge had ordered personal testimony by a president.
The White House has said the President will resist the
subpoena on constitutional grounds.
Terrorists Blast British Bus
BATLEY, England — Terrorists blew up a busload of
British servicemen and their families yesterday with a
50-pound bomb that police said ripped the vehicle apart
like a can opener, killing 11 persons and wounding 14.
Police and the army say they suspected the blast was the
work of the Irish Republican Army, battling the British in
Northern Ireland. Authorities launched one of Britain's
biggest dragnets in an effort to capture the bombers.

Springs.
