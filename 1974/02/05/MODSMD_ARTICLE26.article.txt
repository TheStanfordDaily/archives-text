# Local Peace Corps Recruitment Lags Despite National Increase
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Although the University was once
considered a prime source of Peace
Corps applicants, the recent turnout
here disappointed the expectations of
recruiters for ACTION, a national
amalgamation of volunteer groups.
In the past few years, a decreasing
number of Stanford students have
signed up with the Peace Corps,
contrasting with nationwide statistics
showing the program's increased
popularity. The latest recruiting trip
here garnered only 26 applicants,
compared to 40 at Humboldt State.
Stanford is currently rated seventh
among the colleges in the Northern
California-Nevada recruiting division
of the Peace Corps, although it was
third highest in the nation five or six
years ago, according to recruiters.
National Trend
Most other colleges in the division,
reflecting a trend for the area as a
whole, show a proportionately higher
number of interested students than
Stanford, the recruiters say. UC
Berkeley, UC Davis, San Jose State,
San Francisco State, Humboldt State,
and Fresno State now rank above
Stanford respectively.
Also in contrast to the Stanford
drop, applications from the Northern
California-Nevada area, which hit a
slump in the late 1960s after peaking
in 1964-65, are on the rise again. In
fact, 1973 was the best recruiting year
of the past five.
Area recruiters are puzzled by the
apparent drop in interest among
Stanford students. The recruiters
initially speculated that they might be
losing potential applicants to the
University's Volunteers in Asia
program, but learned that the number
of students in that program was too
small to be a significant factor.
Loss Of Interest
One Stanford student suggested that
the departure of Allard Lowenstein,
assistant dean of men until 1962, may
have contributed to the loss of

interest, since Lowenstein reportedly
had generated much student interest in
activities like the Peace Corps.
Brooks Thorlaksson, ACTION
recruiter, suggested student disinterest
might stem from the Peace Corps' loss
of novelty. It isn't talked about as
often as before, she said.
"People think Peace Corps and
VISTA are dead," Thorlaksson
commented. "They don't know that
we've still got a lot of good things
going."
Skills Wanted
Recently, the Peace Corps is placing
a greater emphasis on working
experience and practical skills in its
recruiting drives, an apparent result of
an increasing number of requests from
other countries for Peace Corps

volunteers with specific skills.*
Thorlaksson defined having a skill as
having a BA or BS degree in any field.
"Whatever [kind of degree] you have,
we can probably use it," she remarked.
Another trend was noted by Phil
Bernstein, ACTION'S Area
Communications Manager: the
age of a Peace Corps volunteer has
risen from 23.9 in 1960 to 27.2 in
1973. There have also been an
increasing number of volunteers over
the age of 50. Bernstein says this trend
could be a side effect of the Peace
Corps recruiting drives for people with
viable skills.
Nationally, Peace Corps applications
are on the increase, recruiters report.
Cessation of the draft hasn't seemed to
affect recruiting at all.

popularity. The latest recruiting trip
here garnered only 26 applicants,
compared to 40 at Humboldt State.
Stanford is currently rated seventh
among the colleges in the Northern
California-Nevada recruiting division
of the Peace Corps, although it was
third highest in the nation five or six
years ago, according to recruiters.
National Trend
Most other colleges in the division,
reflecting a trend for the area as a
whole, show a proportionately higher
number of interested students than
Stanford, the recruiters say. UC
Berkeley, UC Davis, San Jose State,
San Francisco State, Humboldt State,
and Fresno State now rank above
Stanford respectively.
Also in contrast to the Stanford
drop, applications from the Northern
California-Nevada area, which hit a
slump in the late 1960s after peaking
in 1964-65, are on the rise again. In
fact, 1973 was the best recruiting year
of the past five.
Area recruiters are puzzled by the
apparent drop in interest among
Stanford students. The recruiters
initially speculated that they might be
losing potential applicants to the
University's Volunteers in Asia
program, but learned that the number
of students in that program was too
small to be a significant factor.
Loss Of Interest
One Stanford student suggested that
the departure of Allard Lowenstein,
assistant dean of men until 1962, may
have contributed to the loss of

interest, since Lowenstein reportedly
had generated much student interest in
activities like the Peace Corps.
Brooks Thorlaksson, ACTION
recruiter, suggested student disinterest
might stem from the Peace Corps' loss
of novelty. It isn't talked about as
often as before, she said.
"People think Peace Corps and
VISTA are dead," Thorlaksson
commented. "They don't know that
we've still got a lot of good things
going."
Skills Wanted
Recently, the Peace Corps is placing
a greater emphasis on working
experience and practical skills in its
recruiting drives, an apparent result of
an increasing number of requests from
other countries for Peace Corps

volunteers with specific skills.*
Thorlaksson defined having a skill as
having a BA or BS degree in any field.
"Whatever [kind of degree] you have,
we can probably use it," she remarked.
Another trend was noted by Phil
Bernstein, ACTION'S Area
Communications Manager: the
age of a Peace Corps volunteer has
risen from 23.9 in 1960 to 27.2 in
1973. There have also been an
increasing number of volunteers over
the age of 50. Bernstein says this trend
could be a side effect of the Peace
Corps recruiting drives for people with
viable skills.
Nationally, Peace Corps applications
are on the increase, recruiters report.
Cessation of the draft hasn't seemed to
affect recruiting at all.
Although the University was once
considered a prime source of Peace
Corps applicants, the recent turnout
here disappointed the expectations of
recruiters for ACTION, a national
amalgamation of volunteer groups.
In the past few years, a decreasing
number of Stanford students have
signed up with the Peace Corps,
contrasting with nationwide statistics
showing the program's increased
popularity. The latest recruiting trip
