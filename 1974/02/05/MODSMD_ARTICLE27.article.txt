# Indochina Expert To Speak
## 
### 
Indochina authority Don Luce will speak tonight at 8 in the Tresidder
Large Lounge on the subject "The U.S. and Indochina â€” One Year Later."
His speech is sponsored by the Bechtel International Center and the
Indochina Mobile Education Project which Luce heads.
Luce made world headlines in 1970 when he and two U.S. congressmen
discovered the notorious "tiger cages" in one of South Vietnam's largest
prisons.
Since then, he has testified before House and Senate Committees on
prison conditions and refugees in South Vietnam, and has served as a
special correspondent for ABC News.
