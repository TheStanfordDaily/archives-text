# Dealers Blame Disc Price Rise On Vinyl Shortage, Artist Costs
## 
### SUZIE BOSS 
Prices for gasoline and records have
been spinning upward over the past
few months. These parallel cost
increases may be no coincidence,
according to local record dealers.
Vinylite, the material used in
making records, is an oil product.
During the last year of limited oil
availability, record manufacturers have
raised their suggested list prices for
most new records from $5.98 to

$6.98.
"The fuel shortage is one of the
stories put out by record companies
for the increase in costs," said Connie
Hillis, assistant manager of Discount
Records in Menlo Park. "Whether it's
true or not is another question," Hillis
said, "but there is no doubt that
record prices have gone up."
The dollar jump in suggested list
price started last fall, according to
John Broholm of Banana Records in

Palo Alto. "The Beatles were the first
to bring the list price up to $6.98," he
said. Throughout the fall, "it was a
mixed bag of prices. By now,
practically all new releases are listed at
$6.98."
Most retail record outlets in this
area sell below the manufacturer's
suggested price.
"A $6.98 list costs the store more,
too," Hillis said. The dealer had to pay
an average of $3.15 for each $5.98 list
record, but now pays $3.75 for one
listed at $6.98. "This cost gets passed
down the line to the consumer," Hillis
said.
Inflationary Spiral
A higher price for vinyl is just one
factor in the whole price picture,
according to Broholm. "It's all part of
the inflationary spiral," he said.
"Records aro not exempt from
Nixon's economic policies."
Broholm cited a paper shortage as
another cause for the spiraling trend.
"There's a manipulated cardboard
shortage on now," he said.
"Companies are concentrating
production on the slick paper that
goes into expensive books. As a result,
less cardboard that is needed for
album covers is being turned out."
Record manufacturers list no
specific reasons when upping record
prices. "We get a form letter that
refers to increased production costs in
general terms," said David Blaine of
Sound Sources in Palo Alto.
Studio Increases
Blaine and Broholm agree that
higher costs for studio time also figure
in the price picture.
"Some artists are telling the
studios, 4 1 can get more than the usual
list price for you,' " Blaine said. He
added that certain recording artists
"would probably abstain from that

PRICES RISING — Due to high artists' costs and lack of oil-based products,
records like these will go up in price. Some hope that these typical Stanford
Bookstore records are phased out altogether.
practice."
Broholm attributed artists'
increased payment demands to a
higher cost of living. "It costs them
more to live now, too," he said.
Manufacturers' advertising expenses
may also contribute to higher prices.
"They pour a lot of money into ads,"
Blaine said, "and they have to generate
that money from other sources."
Recycled Records
According to a local used record
dealer, manufacturers are starting to
turn to recycling as a means of
generating the materials needed for
record production. "They're starting
to reuse vinyl from budget records,"
said John Siscoe of Chimaera Used
Books and Records.
"Budgets" are records that did not
sell well when first released. "Before,
they would try and sell them for a
lower price," Siscoe said, "but now,
they're using that vinyl over again. If a
record stops selling, they'll stop

pressing it, and reuse the vinyl."
Siscoe feels this could "eventually
have some bad effects on music."
Specialty items will suffer, he predicts.
"Blues, jazz, blue-grass — these only,
sell to a few now." Siscoe said the
market for music "outside of
rock-and-roll and 'schlock' is very
small. Specialty things may just stop
being pressed."
Classical Squeeze
Discount Records in Menlo Park
has already begun "punishing the
classical people," said Hillis. Although
she finds the policy "unfair," she said
the store had to raise prices on
classical records from $4.79 to $4.99
within the last week. "We may be
able to get the prices back down," she
noted. "But, if you realize some list
prices for classics are now up to $7.98,
we may be doing well to hold it at
$4.99."
Despite the rising costs, most
dealers have not reported any slumps
in business. "It's weird," Hillis said,
"but, if anything, we're doing
better."
At Chimaera Used Records, Siscoe
said higher new record prices "have
affected us for the better. Used
business has picked up."
Although sales have slowed down
since December at Banana Records,
Broholm said business is "usually soft
in January and February. ItH start
picking up again in the spring."
Higher price tags have "not really
slowed business down" at Sound
Sources either, said Blaine. "If people
want the new releases, they'll pay
more for them."
