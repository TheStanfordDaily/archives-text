# Dealers Blame Disc Price Rise On Vinyl Shortage, Artist Costs

Prices for gasoline and records have
been spinning upward over the past
few months. These parallel cost
increases may be no coincidence,
according to local record dealers.
Vinylite, the material used in
making records, is an oil product.
During the last year of limited oil
availability, record manufacturers have
raised their suggested list prices for
most new records from $5.98 to

$6.98.
"The fuel shortage is one of the
stories put out by record companies
for the increase in costs," said Connie
Hillis, assistant manager of Discount
Records in Menlo Park. "Whether it's
true or not is another question," Hillis
said, "but there is no doubt that
record prices have gone up."
The dollar jump in suggested list
price started last fall, according to
John Broholm of Banana Records in

Palo Alto. "The Beatles were the first
to bring the list price up to $6.98," he
said. Throughout the fall, "it was a
mixed bag of prices. By now,
practically all new releases are listed at
$6.98."
Most retail record outlets in this
area sell below the manufacturer's
suggested price.
"A $6.98 list costs the store more,
too," Hillis said. The dealer had to pay
an average of $3.15 for each $5.98 list
record, but now pays $3.75 for one
listed at $6.98. "This cost gets passed
down the line to the consumer," Hillis
said.
Inflationary Spiral
A higher price for vinyl is just one
factor in the whole price picture,
according to Broholm. "It's all part of
the inflationary spiral," he said.
"Records aro not exempt from
Nixon's economic policies."
Broholm cited a paper shortage as
another cause for the spiraling trend.
"There's a manipulated cardboard
shortage on now," he said.
"Companies are concentrating
production on the slick paper that
goes into expensive books. As a result,
less cardboard that is needed for
album covers is being turned out."
Record manufacturers list no
specific reasons when upping record
prices. "We get a form letter that
refers to increased production costs in
general terms," said David Blaine of
Sound Sources in Palo Alto.
Studio Increases
Blaine and Broholm agree that
higher costs for studio time also figure
in the price picture.
"Some artists are telling the
studios, 4 1 can get more than the usual
list price for you,' " Blaine said. He
added that certain recording artists
"would probably abstain from that

PRICES RISING — Due to high artists' costs and lack of oil-based products,
records like these will go up in price. Some hope that these typical Stanford
Bookstore records are phased out altogether.
