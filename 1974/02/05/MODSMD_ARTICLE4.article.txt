# Legal Staff Grows As Do Disputes
## 
### 
Campus issues posing legal
questions attract attention almost
every week, but few people know of
the 16 University attorneys who try to
keep Stanford out of court.
The legal staff here has grown
quietly but rapidly to handle new,
more diffuse responsibilities. When
Cassius Kirk, senior staff counsel to
the University vice president for
business and finance, began work here
in 1960, University lawyers served as a
liaison with an outside law firm, which
actually handled Stanford's legal
business.

Kirk says the outside firm,
McCutchen Doyle Brown & Enersen,
now handles one-quarter of the legal
work. In-house attorneys refer
sophisticated tax questions and major
trial work to the outside counsel, but
do all other legal work themselves.
Stanford's legal affairs cover a
broad range of civil and administrative
law. Attorneys work on personnel
policies, labor negotiations,
compliance with government
regulations in several fields, student
and faculty discipline, land
development, copyright and patent
problems, as well as torts, contracts,
and the like.
Two Reasons
According to Kirk and James Siena,
legal adviser to President Richard
Lyman, the legal workload has
increased for two reasons: the state
and federal governments have
regulated University affairs more and
more, and Stanford has moved toward
more legalistic, formal internal
procedures.
Kirk believes in-house lawyers are
closer to their clients and have a wider
knowledge of the University than their
counterparts in an outside firm, who
may work on single, isolated cases for
Stanford.
The University now has five
attorneys in the Office of Business and
Finance, three in the Medical Center,
five in the General Secretary's Office,
and one each in the Purchasing
Department, the Linear Accelerator
Center and the President's Office.
Informal Work
The Business and Finance staff
counsel work informally, according to
Kirk, sometimes advising secretaries

and clerks on University legal
difficulties. "We don't require a
request from a department head. We
expect inquiries from people in
departments," he says.
The five Business and Finance
lawyers handle the widest range of
problems, including some unusual in
academic institutions. University land
holdings and development in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center create
landlord-tenant problems, complicated
lease arrangements and conflicts with
local government — which all occupy
lawyers' time.
In addition, federal and state
authorities have recently ruled that
Stanford must comply with a whole
body of administrative law on
employee matters, which it had
disregarded as irrelevant.

Wage and hour laws, the
Occupational Safety and Health Act
and rules promulgated by the National
Labor Relations Board have all forced
the University to adapt to new
regulations.
"The trend seems to be toward a
much more regulated society," Kirk
observes.
Siena phrases the issue differently:
"There is always the risk of more
efforts at government control in the
academic arena following government
money. I'm surprised there haven't
been more efforts at federal
regulation."
The bureaucracy required by
Medicare and Medi-Cal occupies three
lawyers at the Medical Center,
including John Schwartz, recently
reassigned from the President's office.

Stanford.
The University now has five
attorneys in the Office of Business and
Finance, three in the Medical Center,
five in the General Secretary's Office,
and one each in the Purchasing
Department, the Linear Accelerator
Center and the President's Office.
Informal Work
The Business and Finance staff
counsel work informally, according to
Kirk, sometimes advising secretaries

and clerks on University legal
difficulties. "We don't require a
request from a department head. We
expect inquiries from people in
departments," he says.
The five Business and Finance
lawyers handle the widest range of
problems, including some unusual in
academic institutions. University land
holdings and development in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center create
landlord-tenant problems, complicated
lease arrangements and conflicts with
local government — which all occupy
lawyers' time.
In addition, federal and state
authorities have recently ruled that
Stanford must comply with a whole
body of administrative law on
employee matters, which it had
disregarded as irrelevant.

Wage and hour laws, the
Occupational Safety and Health Act
and rules promulgated by the National
Labor Relations Board have all forced
the University to adapt to new
regulations.
"The trend seems to be toward a
much more regulated society," Kirk
observes.
Siena phrases the issue differently:
"There is always the risk of more
efforts at government control in the
academic arena following government
money. I'm surprised there haven't
been more efforts at federal
regulation."
The bureaucracy required by
Medicare and Medi-Cal occupies three
lawyers at the Medical Center,
including John Schwartz, recently
reassigned from the President's office.

HOUSE LAWYERS — John Schwartz, right, who works in the Medical Center, and James Siena, legal adviser to President
Lyman, are two of the 16 lawyers the University hires to solve its increasingly complex legal quagmires.
Campus issues posing legal
questions attract attention almost
every week, but few people know of
the 16 University attorneys who try to
keep Stanford out of court.
The legal staff here has grown
quietly but rapidly to handle new,
more diffuse responsibilities. When
Cassius Kirk, senior staff counsel to
the University vice president for
business and finance, began work here
in 1960, University lawyers served as a
liaison with an outside law firm, which
actually handled Stanford's legal
business.

Kirk says the outside firm,
McCutchen Doyle Brown & Enersen,
now handles one-quarter of the legal
work. In-house attorneys refer
sophisticated tax questions and major
trial work to the outside counsel, but
do all other legal work themselves.
Stanford's legal affairs cover a
broad range of civil and administrative
law. Attorneys work on personnel
policies, labor negotiations,
compliance with government
regulations in several fields, student
and faculty discipline, land
development, copyright and patent
problems, as well as torts, contracts,
and the like.
Two Reasons
According to Kirk and James Siena,
legal adviser to President Richard
Lyman, the legal workload has
increased for two reasons: the state
and federal governments have
regulated University affairs more and
more, and Stanford has moved toward
more legalistic, formal internal
procedures.
Kirk believes in-house lawyers are
closer to their clients and have a wider
knowledge of the University than their
counterparts in an outside firm, who
may work on single, isolated cases for
Stanford.

attorneys in the Office of Business and

five in the General Secretary's Office,
