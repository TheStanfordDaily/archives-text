# Oregon Governor
## McCall To Speak 
### 
Oregon Governor Tom McCall
will deliver what is being billed as
a major policy address today at 8
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
MeCall, a Republican, is a
potential candidate for his party's
presidential nomination in 1976.
Sponsored jointly by the
Communication Department and
the Program in Values,
Technology and Society, his talk
will be the annual Kate Herrick
Maddox Distinguished Lecture. It
will be entitled "The Oregon
Mystique."
Having served as his state's
chief executive since 1967, McCall
has been a pioneering
environmentalist. Under his
leadership, Oregon has banned all
pop-top cans and nonreturnable
bottles, banned outdoor billboard
lighting, ordered a 20 percent cut
in power consumption and
become the first stale to set a
55-mile-per-hour speed limit and
institute gas rationing.
McCall, who was a journalist
before entering public life, still
takes notes at closed governors'
meetings and shares them with the
press afterward.
