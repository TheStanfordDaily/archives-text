# P.A. Council Recommends No New County Buses
## 
### BILL ROSS 
A county plan to expand its bus
fleet prompted the Palo Alto City
Council last night to recommend to
the County Board of Supervisors that
the bus system not be expanded.
The motion, introduced by
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum,
passed 5-3, with Council members
Kirke Comstock, Enid Pearson and
Alan Henderson dissenting.
The Board of Supervisors has
planned to start a 200-bus operation in
the county next autumn. Also, it has
selected a consultant to study a fixed
rail system for the city.
"In my view, an enlarged bus fleet
does not represent a feasible solution
to the County's transportation
problem," Rosenbaum wrote in a
letter to his colleagues on the Council.
"Buses are slow, they travel the same
congested roads as the automobiles
and their operating expenses are very
high."
Rosenbaum pointed out tMat a fleet
of several thousand buses would be
necessary to significantly reduce the
volume of traffic in the county.
Expanded bus service would also
trigger tax increases, he argued.

A better response to the traffic
dilemma would be to encourage the
creation of car pools, Rosenbaum
contended. If the average number of
people per car could be raised from
1.2 to 1.5 during commuting hours, a
20 percent reduction in the use of cars
could be accomplished, he claimed.
But Henderson stated that car pools
are only a fad that will pass when the
current sense of emergency disappears.
He said that the proposed bus system
is inadequate because it does not allow
for enough buses. Henderson said he
saw nothing wrong with putting 500
or 600 buses on the road.
Councilman John Beahrs
contended, however, that buses won't
solve the problem of urban sprawl,
especially since few people will use
them. "I am appalled by the large
number of vacant seats that I see on
buses each day,"he said.
Rosenbaum's motion also called for
planning studies regarding a rapid
transit system to be completed as soon
as possible, and for serious
consideration to be given to a parking
tax and other automobile-related taxes
to provide revenue for a transit
system.
