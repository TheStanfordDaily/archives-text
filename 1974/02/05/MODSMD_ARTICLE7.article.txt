Surveys have shown that the Daily is the most widely-read medium of
communication on campus. However, despite this fact, the vast majority of
readers have little idea how to utilize the Daily to reach its audience. Since
yesterday marked the beginning of a new volume of the paper with a largely
new staff of editors we thought that it would be appropriate to set down some
of the procedures readers can use to gain access to the paper's columns.
On a campus as diverse as this one, there are innumerable groups and
organizations engaged in a myriad of different activities. Chances are that at
some point or another, almost all of these groups will seek some notice of their
meetings or activities in the Daily - and will be disappointed when harried news
editors politely suggest the "Once Around the Quad" section. What some readers
fail to realize is simply that if wc were to satisfy every publicity officer of every
group with an article, even a very short one, we'd have almost literally no room
for anything else.
The remedy for this is the "Once Around the Quad" section — a handy
compendium of what's going on in the community from day to day. It exists to
fulfill just this "community bulletin board" responsibility, and is one of the
paper's better-read features. OATQ items must be submitted in writing only
and must reach the Daily no later than 1 p.m. two days before the desired
publication (production schedules require the early deadlines). There are special
forms for OATQ in the hallway in front of the Daily editorial offices — but
please, don't hoard them. Somewhere on this campus, a department secretary or
club publicity officer must have at least 20,000 forms stashed away by now.
For certain events of more general community interest, such as Oregon Gov.
Tom McCall's speech tonight, we will sometimes run preview stories or boxes.
But these stories arc determined by the news department's estimation of the
newsworthiness of the event, and these instances are the exception rather than
the rule.
The letters to the editor section is another valuable avenue of access to the
Daily. Letters can cover almost any topic: they can find fault with the Daily, its
reporters or columnists; respond to other letters; congratulate or roast a
deserving University official. In short, they are a vehicle in which to sound off.
All wc ask is that letters be typed and double-spaced on a 62-space line. Of
course, we reserve the right to select and edit the letters hut we want to be
able to run as many letters representing as many viewpoints as possible. Letters
should be mailed or brought in to the Opinions Editor.
Items concerning cultural exhibits, plays, recitals, concerts and the like
should be sent to the entertainment department. This includes entries for the
weekly entertainment calendar.
In general, news, feature and entertainment story ideas and information that
are submitted in writing stand a much better chance of eventually seeing
publication than do ideas submitted over the phone or in person. Written
information no matter how brief can be passed from one editor to another
within the same department, or routed to another department, or handed to a
reporter. Verbal information tends to be neglected, or written down on a scrap
of paper that is accidently thrown away, or forgotten in the face of a mountain
of other work.
The Daily will continually strive to fulfill its responsibility to keep the
Stanford community as informed and up-to-date as possible. If you have
something to say, these relatively simple guidelines will help you get your
message across with the fewest problems for you and the fewest problems for
the Daily.

Items concerning cultural exhibits, plays, recitals, concerts and the like
should be sent to the entertainment department. This includes entries for the
weekly entertainment calendar.
In general, news, feature and entertainment story ideas and information that
are submitted in writing stand a much better chance of eventually seeing
publication than do ideas submitted over the phone or in person. Written
information no matter how brief can be passed from one editor to another
within the same department, or routed to another department, or handed to a
reporter. Verbal information tends to be neglected, or written down on a scrap
of paper that is accidently thrown away, or forgotten in the face of a mountain
of other work.
The Daily will continually strive to fulfill its responsibility to keep the
Stanford community as informed and up-to-date as possible. If you have
something to say, these relatively simple guidelines will help you get your
message across with the fewest problems for you and the fewest problems for
the Daily.
Surveys have shown that the Daily is the most widely-read medium of
communication on campus. However, despite this fact, the vast majority of
readers have little idea how to utilize the Daily to reach its audience. Since
yesterday marked the beginning of a new volume of the paper with a largely
new staff of editors we thought that it would be appropriate to set down some
of the procedures readers can use to gain access to the paper's columns.
On a campus as diverse as this one, there are innumerable groups and
organizations engaged in a myriad of different activities. Chances are that at
some point or another, almost all of these groups will seek some notice of their
meetings or activities in the Daily - and will be disappointed when harried news
editors politely suggest the "Once Around the Quad" section. What some readers
fail to realize is simply that if wc were to satisfy every publicity officer of every
group with an article, even a very short one, we'd have almost literally no room
for anything else.
The remedy for this is the "Once Around the Quad" section — a handy
compendium of what's going on in the community from day to day. It exists to
fulfill just this "community bulletin board" responsibility, and is one of the
paper's better-read features. OATQ items must be submitted in writing only
and must reach the Daily no later than 1 p.m. two days before the desired
publication (production schedules require the early deadlines). There are special
forms for OATQ in the hallway in front of the Daily editorial offices — but
please, don't hoard them. Somewhere on this campus, a department secretary or
club publicity officer must have at least 20,000 forms stashed away by now.
For certain events of more general community interest, such as Oregon Gov.
Tom McCall's speech tonight, we will sometimes run preview stories or boxes.
But these stories arc determined by the news department's estimation of the
newsworthiness of the event, and these instances are the exception rather than
the rule.
The letters to the editor section is another valuable avenue of access to the
Daily. Letters can cover almost any topic: they can find fault with the Daily, its
reporters or columnists; respond to other letters; congratulate or roast a
deserving University official. In short, they are a vehicle in which to sound off.
All wc ask is that letters be typed and double-spaced on a 62-space line. Of
course, we reserve the right to select and edit the letters hut we want to be
able to run as many letters representing as many viewpoints as possible. Letters
should be mailed or brought in to the Opinions Editor.
