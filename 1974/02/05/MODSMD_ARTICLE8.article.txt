Speakers Bureau
Editor:
I wholeheartedly agree with Larry
Diamond's call for a greater awareness
on the Stanford campus (Daily, Jan.
31). A more active Speakers' Bureau
would certainly help to increase the
level of social consciousness of the
Stanford student body.
The ASSU Speakers' Bureau is
already making major revisions in
structure and policy, aimed at bringing
more visitors to the Stanford campus.
We are developing our
"Guests-in-Residence" Program,
through which speakers will stay on
campus for several days. We are
investigating sources of increased
funding, which will be able to support
an expanded speakers' program.
In the coming months, the Bureau
hopes to bring to campus such public
figures as former Chi*f Justice Earl
Warren, heart surgeon Dr. Micahel
Deßakey, and Senator Edward
Kennedy. But Mr. Diamond was
correct when he pointed out that an
active Speakers' Bureau at Stanford
depends on the help of the student
body. The Bureau cannot continue to
operate, much less expand, without
the help of concerned students.
The Bureau is grossly understaffed,
and needs help in all areas of its
operation. So students who are
particularly qualified, or just plain
interested in helping out, can do so by
dropping by the ASSU offices, second
floor, Tresidder Union.

Generic Drugs
Editor:
Bob Lowe wrote last week about
"generic prescriptions," and as a
physician with some personal
experience in this subject I have some
comments to make.
The article published carried the
headline of "generic prescriptions
mean lower prices," and this is most
always true, but for whom? Always
for the pharmacist who buys the
generic drugs, but all too frequently he
simply charges the patient

approximately what the "brand-name
drugs" are sold for, and increases his
profit margin. If he does pass the
discount along to the patient, it may
not reflect the actual "saving."
The higher price of the
"brand-name drug" was said to be
"mainly" due to the research costs of
developing the new drug or drugs, but
it should be considered that "quality
control" adds a tremendous cost to
the selling cost of the medicine. The
large drug firms protect their
reputations, both from a legal and a
"Madison Avenue" basis by labeling
lots of shipments, weighing each tablet
and capsule to make sure that when a
capsule is supposed to contain 250
milligrams, it does, checking for the
possibility of impurities in the
medicines, and this costs money.
The reason our machines work
fantastically in space millions of miles
from earth, and our clocks in the cars
don't work is that lots of
"quality-control" was paid by the
government, and little was given to
these clocks by the auto-makers.
Which brings me to how the "push"
was originally started by the
government to buy "generic drugs."
The Veterans Administration, for
example, would place a bid to buy 200
million capsules of tetracycline for so
much money, usually far under the
price for a "brand-name" tetracycline;
but into the drug factory would go
government pharmacists who
monitored each batch-lot, would
measure the amount of powder in
random samples of the drug, and so
created good "quality control." BUT,
the cost of this "quality control" was
billed to another section of the VA,
the pharmacy section, and never
appeared as a cost of the purchase of
the medicine. Gradually the concept
grew that "generic drugs" wen*
identical in dosage and effect and were
always much cheaper. There's no free
lunch.
With "generic drugs" there is no
"quality control" to protect the public
— nobody knows who made the
medicine, and under which kind of
conditions. Price is the only criterion.

In the coming months, the Bureau
hopes to bring to campus such public
figures as former Chi*f Justice Earl
Warren, heart surgeon Dr. Micahel
Deßakey, and Senator Edward
Kennedy. But Mr. Diamond was
correct when he pointed out that an
active Speakers' Bureau at Stanford
depends on the help of the student
body. The Bureau cannot continue to
operate, much less expand, without
the help of concerned students.
The Bureau is grossly understaffed,
and needs help in all areas of its
operation. So students who are
particularly qualified, or just plain
interested in helping out, can do so by
dropping by the ASSU offices, second
floor, Tresidder Union.

Bob Lowe wrote last week about
"generic prescriptions," and as a
physician with some personal
experience in this subject I have some
comments to make.
The article published carried the
headline of "generic prescriptions
mean lower prices," and this is most
always true, but for whom? Always
for the pharmacist who buys the
generic drugs, but all too frequently he
simply charges the patient

approximately what the "brand-name
drugs" are sold for, and increases his
profit margin. If he does pass the
discount along to the patient, it may
not reflect the actual "saving."
The higher price of the
"brand-name drug" was said to be
"mainly" due to the research costs of
developing the new drug or drugs, but
it should be considered that "quality
control" adds a tremendous cost to
the selling cost of the medicine. The
large drug firms protect their
reputations, both from a legal and a
"Madison Avenue" basis by labeling
lots of shipments, weighing each tablet
and capsule to make sure that when a
capsule is supposed to contain 250
milligrams, it does, checking for the
possibility of impurities in the
medicines, and this costs money.
The reason our machines work
fantastically in space millions of miles
from earth, and our clocks in the cars
don't work is that lots of
"quality-control" was paid by the
government, and little was given to
these clocks by the auto-makers.
Which brings me to how the "push"
was originally started by the
government to buy "generic drugs."
The Veterans Administration, for
example, would place a bid to buy 200
million capsules of tetracycline for so
much money, usually far under the
price for a "brand-name" tetracycline;
but into the drug factory would go
government pharmacists who
monitored each batch-lot, would
measure the amount of powder in
random samples of the drug, and so
created good "quality control." BUT,
the cost of this "quality control" was
billed to another section of the VA,
the pharmacy section, and never
appeared as a cost of the purchase of
the medicine. Gradually the concept
grew that "generic drugs" wen*
identical in dosage and effect and were
always much cheaper. There's no free
lunch.
With "generic drugs" there is no
"quality control" to protect the public
— nobody knows who made the
medicine, and under which kind of
conditions. Price is the only criterion.

I wholeheartedly agree with Larry
Diamond's call for a greater awareness
on the Stanford campus (Daily, Jan.
31). A more active Speakers' Bureau
would certainly help to increase the
level of social consciousness of the
Stanford student body.
The ASSU Speakers' Bureau is
already making major revisions in
structure and policy, aimed at bringing
more visitors to the Stanford campus.
We are developing our
"Guests-in-Residence" Program,
through which speakers will stay on
campus for several days. We are
investigating sources of increased
funding, which will be able to support
an expanded speakers' program.
