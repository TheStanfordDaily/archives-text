# Lyman Asks Row Review, Friend Says
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
President Lyman has asked a
University subcommittee on faculty
staff housing to re-evaluate plans for
the faculty housing project on the
Row, ASSU vice president Jim Friend
reported last night at an ASSU Senate
meeting.
Ed Shaw, executive assistant to the
University vice president and provost,
discussed Lyman's request in
yesterday's meeting of a faculty-staff
housing subcommittee, according to
Friend, who attended that meeting.
Shaw will report back to the
subcommittee in three weeks with
more information about the issue,
Friend said.
Friend stressed that committee
action does not mean the University is
changing its plans to build the project,
but rather it is "opening up the
decision-making process."
This re-examination is one of the
goals of today's referendum, Friend
said. "I'm pleased they admit that
they can make a mistake." But, he
added, "I wish they'd admit they
made a mistake."
Friend praised the subcommittee
for its responsiveness and
reconsideration of the project. He said
they set aside all other agenda items
and discussed the project for the full
two hour meeting.
Friend also credited Bruce Wolfe
and Joellyn Murphy, the first students
to serve on that subcommittee.
In other action, the Senate
appropriated $250 for a Women's Day
Fair to be held on campus in March, in
commemoration of International
Women's Day.
Senate Chairman Reggie Turner
outlined plans for a Senate
"Community Communication Plan" to
get student feedback on "what the
student body wants from a
government and what it needs done."
Each senator will be responsible for
distributing the minutes and agenda of
Senate meetings and senators' names,
phone numbers, and times when they
are available to talk with interested
students, according to Turner.
