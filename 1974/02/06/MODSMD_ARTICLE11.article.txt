# More Perilous Than Agnew
## Vice President Ford: An Overview 
### 
► Andrew Leuchter

In his undergraduate years at the University of
Michigan, Gerald Ford was the Wolverines gridiron
hero. With the strapping upperclassman in the front
line, Michigan had two undefeated seasons; Ford, as
one of their star players, was pressured to join the
"pros." But the 6'4 center from Omaha, Nebraska,
turned down lucrative offers from both Green Bay
and Detroit to follow another career — politics.
After 25 years in government, Gerald Ford's
public manner still seems more accustomed to
football than to politics. He remains a low-profile,
team player. Though he was long an effective leader
of the House Republican squad, he never planned
strategy — he followed a party policy sent in from
the sidelines. His lackluster manner and blind
adherence to "the party line" once prompted LBJ
to comment wryly on Ford's college football days.
The late President suggested that Ford had "played
football too long without a helmet."
Ford's colorless. style of little rhetoric and less
humor does give him the appearance of a glorified
"yes-man." Indeed, whatever convictions he may
hold on his own have been submerged in his greater
loyalty to the Republican party and to President
Nixon. But the elements of Ford's personal politics
are unmistakably there. A closer look at Ford's
actions as Representative and now Vice President
reveals the essence of Gerald Ford's elusive political
ethic.
Tried Impeaching Douglas
In 1970 following the stinging rejections of
Supreme Court nominees Clement Haynsworth and
Harold Carswell, Representative Ford launched an
ill-fated effort to impeach Justice William O.
Douglas. The "Impeach Douglas" drive is unique
among Ford's congressional crusades — it is one of
few that he executed on his own initiative. The
Minority Leader could not muster enough support

for his movement, however, and it died pigeonholed
in the House Judiciary Committee.
His drive to impeach the liberal Justice Douglas is
as close as Gerald Ford has come to a display of
political emotion. The movement was vindictive
from its inception, and Ford soon proved that he
would stop at nothing to get the evidence he
needed. He solicited the aid of then Attorney
General Mitchell in exposing Douglas' malfeasance;
such collusion with the Executive Branch in a
Congressional inquiry was without precedent. When
it became apparent that Douglas' only wrongdoing
had been writing for a pornographic magazine,
Ford's impeachment drive degenerated into a
moralizing crusade.
The Douglas episode is indicative of the virulent
conservatism which laces Ford's politics. The
overtones of this political ethic are usually well
suppressed, but traces of Ford's right-wing thought
are still detectable. In a letter made public at Ford's
confirmation hearings, he wrote that "the liberal
Democratic viewpoint is dangerous to our way of
life." Since his confirmation, Vice President Ford
has been even more forthright: he has accused the
liberal "Eastern Establishment" of organizing an
"impeachment conspiracy," seeking its ends ahead
of the good of the country.
Ford Unlike Agnew
Even in its stronger moments, Ford's rhetoric
bears scant resemblance to that of his predecesor,
Spiro Agnew. Even Ford's most blistering
billingsgate does not appraoch the scathing Agnew
acrimony. Gerald Ford appears to be what Agnew
once called the "ideological eunuch," guilty of
"pusillanimous pussyfooting on critical issues."
But the differences between Ford and Agnew are
stylistic, not substantive. Agnew attacked his
political enemies forthrightly, while Ford maintains

a low-profile in dealing with the opposition. Mr.
Agnew argued the conservative cause openly,
publicly, before the "silent majority." Vice
President Ford advocates the conservative cause in
Capitol cloakrooms, unobtrusively pressuring for
acceptance of administrative programs. What the
Vice President lacks in rhetorical ability, he makes
up for with influence and political savvy: the former
Representative from Michigan still stands as a
powerful figure in Congress.
In his heyday, Spiro Agnew was almost a
laughable figure. His alliterative antics no doubt
increased Republican solidarity in Middle America.
But for all his attacks on the media and the Eastern
Establishment, he had no long-lasting effect on the
institutions of American government.
Vice President Influential
Gerald Ford, however, cannot be taken so
lightly. He is of the same breed of rabid
conservatism as Agnew — and he stands to have a far
more profound impact on law and government. As
the official administration spokesman on Capitol
Hill, Ford will add a dangerous new impetus to
President Nixon's waning Congressional influence.
The Nixon administration will enjoy the new
influence it needs to tighten restrictions on the
media, to abolish the social programs of the "Great
Society," and to quash an impeachment drive.
Vice President Ford's political ethic, precisely
because it is so innocuous, must be scrutinized all
the more carefully. If Gerald Ford is left to carry
out his congressional lobbying unattended, he may
well become the most influential Vice-President in
United States history — at the country's peril.
