# Faculty Decision Not Final
## Last Word Not In On ROTC 
### 
Doyle McManus

Did the Faculty Senate's decision
last month to postpone consideration
of ROTC indefinitely kill the issue
once and for all?
Probably not.
Powerful forces in the University
still favor the reinstatement of ROTC
— strongly — and they can be expected
to raise the question at some future,
more auspicious point.
It is worth taking another look at
last month's politicking to make a
judgment about why ROTC "failed"
this time around, and when (and how)
it can be expected to return.
Jumping
What happened last month was, in
large part, a simple case of somebody
Jumping The Gun.
The gun-jumper, of course, was Bob
Barker, the applied physics graduate
student who's been pushing ROTC for
the past year. Barker, remarkably
unfazed when his student petitions
were coolly received last spring,
managed this year to garner 52 faculty
signatures, and thus forced the issue to
the Faculty Senate floor.
The reception was still cool —
surprisingly so. Even Academic
Secretary H. Donald Winbigler, who of
all people should be able to judge the
mood of the Senate, expected the
faculty solons to initiate some formal
consideration of ROTC. He was
wrong.
Postpone
The Senate turned out to be
unwilling to raise an issue that looked
like a Pandora's box of rancor and
controversy. On Jan. 24, the Senate
postponed consideration of ROTC
indefinitely, by a lopsided vote of 29
to 12.
Significantly, among the 29
members voting to postpone ROTC
were a few you might normally expect
to stand foursquare behind military

training. Their votes were not against
ROTC itself, but against the specific
petition — against bringing up the
question now.
There was, after all, something
fundamentally ridiculous about Mr.
Barker's petition: not only did it have
little discernible student support, it
had no support at all from the
Department of Defense.
Lesson
The question of student support is
not crucial; if the faculty and Defense
Department wanted ROTC, it would
be quickly forgotten. But the question
of Defense Department support is.
Here Mr. Barker's ill-fated petition
becomes an object lesson in the perils
of Jumping The Gun.
Without Defense Department
collusion, the University — if the
Senate had decided to pursue ROTC —
would have been reduced to
petitioning the Pentagon for its kind
cooperation, an unwonted position
indeed. For despite all the nonsense
about ROTC's imagined benefits to
the University, even the program's
champions clearly expect it to benefit
the national defense more than the
pursuit of knowledge. They would be
much more comfortable if the messy
initiatives came from the army, not
the academy.
To return, however, to Mr. Barker:
without Defense Department help —
and he had none — he was unable to
provide the Senate any coherent,
well-developed proposal for a specific
program. Without knowing what the
Army, or the faculty, would be willing
to accept in compromise of their 1970
positions, Mr. Barker could only
request that the Senate initiate
discussions of the whole, mammoth
question. The Senate (need it be said)
is an unwieldy body, and rarely
relishes the prospect of starting from

scratch on a project as thorny and as
controversial as a Stanfordized ROTC
would be.
Administration
Moreover, Mr. Barker was unable to
elicit much help from the
Administration, always a potentially
important factor in the Senate.
Provost Miller has long been on record
as favoring ROTC in general, but did
little for this particular effort; and
President Lyman jumped on Mr.
Barker's creaky bandwagon, but too
late to do much good. For all we
know, they may wait by the phone
every day for a call from the Pentagon;
but this was not their project.
There was nothing at all in the
Senate's Jan. 24 vote that might
preclude some further pro-ROTC
effort. Indeed, Prof. William Clebsch,
who supports the idea of military
training, reminded the Senate that a
vote against consideration of Mr.
Barker's petition still left the Senate's
official position as it was in 1970: that
some form of ROTC acceptable to the

University ought to be devised.
Almost undoubtedly, one will be.
With the president and provost
publicly interested in the idea, with
student opposition to campus military
training slowly melting away, and with
the faculty more hesitant than
opposed, all that remains is for the
military to make some moves.
Defense Department officials have
privately admitted that they covet the
restoration of ROTC at the elite
schools, Stanford among them. On
some campuses, most notably
Princeton, they have proved amenable
to compromises that eliminate most of
the academic anomalies of ROTC
without destroying its military
usefulness.
The brief flurry of controversy
around Bob Barker's petition may
hold them back for a while. It will not
hold them for long.

like a Pandora's box of rancor and
controversy. On Jan. 24, the Senate
postponed consideration of ROTC
indefinitely, by a lopsided vote of 29
to 12.
Significantly, among the 29
members voting to postpone ROTC
were a few you might normally expect
to stand foursquare behind military

training. Their votes were not against
ROTC itself, but against the specific
petition — against bringing up the
question now.
There was, after all, something
fundamentally ridiculous about Mr.
Barker's petition: not only did it have
little discernible student support, it
had no support at all from the
Department of Defense.
Lesson
The question of student support is
not crucial; if the faculty and Defense
Department wanted ROTC, it would
be quickly forgotten. But the question
of Defense Department support is.
Here Mr. Barker's ill-fated petition
becomes an object lesson in the perils
of Jumping The Gun.
Without Defense Department
collusion, the University — if the
Senate had decided to pursue ROTC —
would have been reduced to
petitioning the Pentagon for its kind
cooperation, an unwonted position
indeed. For despite all the nonsense
about ROTC's imagined benefits to
the University, even the program's
champions clearly expect it to benefit
the national defense more than the
pursuit of knowledge. They would be
much more comfortable if the messy
initiatives came from the army, not
the academy.
To return, however, to Mr. Barker:
without Defense Department help —
and he had none — he was unable to
provide the Senate any coherent,
well-developed proposal for a specific
program. Without knowing what the
Army, or the faculty, would be willing
to accept in compromise of their 1970
positions, Mr. Barker could only
request that the Senate initiate
discussions of the whole, mammoth
question. The Senate (need it be said)
is an unwieldy body, and rarely
relishes the prospect of starting from

scratch on a project as thorny and as
controversial as a Stanfordized ROTC
would be.
Administration
Moreover, Mr. Barker was unable to
elicit much help from the
Administration, always a potentially
important factor in the Senate.
Provost Miller has long been on record
as favoring ROTC in general, but did
little for this particular effort; and
President Lyman jumped on Mr.
Barker's creaky bandwagon, but too
late to do much good. For all we
know, they may wait by the phone
every day for a call from the Pentagon;
but this was not their project.
There was nothing at all in the
Senate's Jan. 24 vote that might
preclude some further pro-ROTC
effort. Indeed, Prof. William Clebsch,
who supports the idea of military
training, reminded the Senate that a
vote against consideration of Mr.
Barker's petition still left the Senate's
official position as it was in 1970: that
some form of ROTC acceptable to the

University ought to be devised.
Almost undoubtedly, one will be.
With the president and provost
publicly interested in the idea, with
student opposition to campus military
training slowly melting away, and with
the faculty more hesitant than
opposed, all that remains is for the
military to make some moves.
Defense Department officials have
privately admitted that they covet the
restoration of ROTC at the elite
schools, Stanford among them. On
some campuses, most notably
Princeton, they have proved amenable
to compromises that eliminate most of
the academic anomalies of ROTC
without destroying its military
usefulness.
The brief flurry of controversy
around Bob Barker's petition may
hold them back for a while. It will not
hold them for long.

Did the Faculty Senate's decision
last month to postpone consideration
of ROTC indefinitely kill the issue
once and for all?
Probably not.
Powerful forces in the University
still favor the reinstatement of ROTC
— strongly — and they can be expected
to raise the question at some future,
more auspicious point.
It is worth taking another look at
last month's politicking to make a
judgment about why ROTC "failed"
this time around, and when (and how)
it can be expected to return.
Jumping
What happened last month was, in
large part, a simple case of somebody
Jumping The Gun.
The gun-jumper, of course, was Bob
Barker, the applied physics graduate
student who's been pushing ROTC for
the past year. Barker, remarkably
unfazed when his student petitions
were coolly received last spring,
managed this year to garner 52 faculty
signatures, and thus forced the issue to
the Faculty Senate floor.
The reception was still cool —
surprisingly so. Even Academic
Secretary H. Donald Winbigler, who of
all people should be able to judge the
mood of the Senate, expected the
faculty solons to initiate some formal
consideration of ROTC. He was
wrong.

much more comfortable if the messy
initiatives came from the army, not
the academy.
To return, however, to Mr. Barker:
without Defense Department help —
and he had none — he was unable to
provide the Senate any coherent,
well-developed proposal for a specific
program. Without knowing what the
Army, or the faculty, would be willing
to accept in compromise of their 1970
positions, Mr. Barker could only
request that the Senate initiate
discussions of the whole, mammoth
question. The Senate (need it be said)
is an unwieldy body, and rarely
relishes the prospect of starting from

scratch on a project as thorny and as
controversial as a Stanfordized ROTC
would be.
Administration
Moreover, Mr. Barker was unable to
elicit much help from the
Administration, always a potentially
important factor in the Senate.
Provost Miller has long been on record
as favoring ROTC in general, but did
little for this particular effort; and
President Lyman jumped on Mr.
Barker's creaky bandwagon, but too
late to do much good. For all we
know, they may wait by the phone
every day for a call from the Pentagon;
but this was not their project.
There was nothing at all in the
Senate's Jan. 24 vote that might
preclude some further pro-ROTC
effort. Indeed, Prof. William Clebsch,
who supports the idea of military
training, reminded the Senate that a
vote against consideration of Mr.
Barker's petition still left the Senate's
official position as it was in 1970: that
some form of ROTC acceptable to the

University ought to be devised.
Almost undoubtedly, one will be.
With the president and provost
publicly interested in the idea, with
student opposition to campus military
training slowly melting away, and with
the faculty more hesitant than
opposed, all that remains is for the
military to make some moves.
Defense Department officials have
privately admitted that they covet the
restoration of ROTC at the elite
schools, Stanford among them. On
some campuses, most notably
Princeton, they have proved amenable
to compromises that eliminate most of
the academic anomalies of ROTC
without destroying its military
usefulness.
The brief flurry of controversy
around Bob Barker's petition may
hold them back for a while. It will not
hold them for long.

Did the Faculty Senate's decision
last month to postpone consideration
of ROTC indefinitely kill the issue
once and for all?
Probably not.
Powerful forces in the University
still favor the reinstatement of ROTC
— strongly — and they can be expected
to raise the question at some future,
more auspicious point.
It is worth taking another look at
last month's politicking to make a
judgment about why ROTC "failed"
this time around, and when (and how)
it can be expected to return.
Jumping
What happened last month was, in
large part, a simple case of somebody
Jumping The Gun.
The gun-jumper, of course, was Bob
Barker, the applied physics graduate
student who's been pushing ROTC for
the past year. Barker, remarkably
unfazed when his student petitions
were coolly received last spring,
managed this year to garner 52 faculty
signatures, and thus forced the issue to
the Faculty Senate floor.
The reception was still cool —
surprisingly so. Even Academic
Secretary H. Donald Winbigler, who of
all people should be able to judge the
mood of the Senate, expected the
faculty solons to initiate some formal
consideration of ROTC. He was
wrong.
Postpone
The Senate turned out to be
unwilling to raise an issue that looked
like a Pandora's box of rancor and
controversy. On Jan. 24, the Senate
postponed consideration of ROTC
indefinitely, by a lopsided vote of 29
to 12.
Significantly, among the 29
members voting to postpone ROTC
were a few you might normally expect
to stand foursquare behind military

training. Their votes were not against
ROTC itself, but against the specific
petition — against bringing up the
question now.
There was, after all, something
fundamentally ridiculous about Mr.
Barker's petition: not only did it have
little discernible student support, it
had no support at all from the
Department of Defense.
Lesson
The question of student support is
not crucial; if the faculty and Defense
Department wanted ROTC, it would
be quickly forgotten. But the question
of Defense Department support is.
Here Mr. Barker's ill-fated petition
becomes an object lesson in the perils
of Jumping The Gun.
Without Defense Department
collusion, the University — if the
Senate had decided to pursue ROTC —
would have been reduced to
petitioning the Pentagon for its kind
cooperation, an unwonted position
indeed. For despite all the nonsense
about ROTC's imagined benefits to
the University, even the program's
champions clearly expect it to benefit
the national defense more than the
pursuit of knowledge. They would be
much more comfortable if the messy
initiatives came from the army, not
the academy.
