# Morrison at 'Ice Rink'
## Oldies Get 'Em Rolling 
### RANDY BAKER 
SAN FRANCISCO - Van
Morrison doesn't like Winterland
crowds. "The hall is an ice rink
and they have it crammed full of
people who don't come to hear
music," he once told Creem
magazine. This is especially
disturbing to someone who
considers himself a musician
rather than a rock and roll
performer. Morrison does not like
large halls in general, because the
people "expect something they're
not gonna get."
Morrison has another reason
for being uncomfortable at
Winterland. About a year ago, he
played an especially bad show
there "that just got blown up out
of proportion" (Morrison's words)
and contributed greatly to his
reputation as an erratic and
uneven performer.
Trouble
Early in Van Morrison's
Saturday night performance at
Winterland, it appeared as if he
was headed for more trouble.
Tense and unsmiling, he led off
with a three song acoustic set

consisting of two songs unfamiliar
to most and Bob Dylan's "Just
Like A Woman," then started his
electric set with another
unfamiliar song.
The crowd, which had come to
hear their favorites, was growing
restless, and a small group in front
kept yelling out requests.
Morrison, who must have heard
cries for "Moondance" a dozen
times during the first four songs,
was finally exasperated to the
point that he yelled at the crowd,
"Just shut up, and you'll hear
what you want." It was not the
best way to establish
performer-audience rapport, and
for a while things were quite
tense. Morrison was obviously
upset at the crowd and they were
not quite sure how to take it.
Tension Release
At that point, only one thing
could relieve the tension — the
music. Morrison and his back-up
band, The Caledonia Soul
Express, swung into the familiar
chords of "Into the Mystic" and
suddenly everything was fine.
Morrison followed "Into the

Mystic" with "Moondance" and a
soul-charged version of Willie
Dixon's "I Just Want to Make
Love to You." By now things
were really rolling and the poor
start was all but forgotten.
During his hour and twenty
minute set, Morrison played songs
from many of his recent albums,
including a fine version of "Listen
to the Lion." Notably, he did not
play any of the hit singles he has
had as a solo artist: "Brown-Eyed
Girl," "Domino," "Loose
Money," "Wild Night," or "Jackie
Wilson Said." While those in the
crowd who were familiar with his
albums did not really miss these,
there were probably those in the
audience who were somewhat
disappointed. However, this is not
to say that Van Morrison did not
play any of his hits.
'A Far Cry'
Among the show closers were
two classics from his days as lead
singer of Them: "Here Comes the
Night" and the all-time great
"Gloria." By this time, Morrison
was loose, smiling freely, and
prancing around the stage. It was
a far cry from the tenseness that
was apparent earlier, and the
audience was with him all the
way.
Despite a poor start, Van
Morrison put on a truly excellent
show, one that will be
remembered for a long time.
Earlier, much earlier, Alice
Stuart and her group Snake
opened the show with an hour of
driving basic rock. Alice is a tough
vocalist who plays electric guitar;
Snake consists of a bassman and a
drummer. Together, they were a
pleasant surprise and the crowd
demanded an encore.
Bloomfield/Naftalin followed

with a fine set of electric blues,
and The Caledonia Soul Express
did a solo set which featured
Dorothy Morrison (no relation to
Van), the soul singer who did "Oh
Happy Day" with The Edwin
Hawkins Singers. They played a
short, high energy set of popular
soul tunes such as "Neither One
of Us" and"I Want to Take You
Higher."
