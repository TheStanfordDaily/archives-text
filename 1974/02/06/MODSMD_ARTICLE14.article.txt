# Violinist Sparkles
## 
### KENNETH DeLONG 
Friday evening, the Stanford Public Events Series featured a
concert by French Violinist Jean-Jacques Kantorow. Although he is
less than thirty years old, Kantorow already has an impressive record,
having captured such famous prizes as the Paganini Competition and
the Tibor Varba Competition. The concert, given in Tresidder Large
Lounge, was well attended and completely fulfilled the promise of the
advance billing.
The program was French in every way and weighted heavily toward
the late nineteenth century. It consisted of sonatas by Leclair, Franck,
and Lalo, and concluded with Saint-Saens' still popular "Rondo
Cappricioso."
The concert opener was the Leclair sonata and it proved to be a
real delight. It is an exuberant and vivacious piece and includes a
tour-de-force finale in gypsy fiddler style. Kantorow's playing
sparkled with brilliance, although his easy mastery occasionally
resulted in overly fast trills that resembled the character of a door
bell.
Plays An Impressive Franck .
The most impressive place of the evening from a musical point of
view was Franck's eternally popular Sonata in A major. This piece, a
bastion of violin literature, is as demanding for the pianist as it is for
the violinist, and it was Kantorow's good fortune to have at the
keyboard a pianist of Francoise Regnat's calibre. It was in this piece
that the special Frenchness of the performers emerged. Although the
piece is richly romantic and loaded with emotion, the performers
never let it overstep the boundary of good taste. The opening
movement was particularly lovely. It had beautiful tone, and was full
of the refined and gentle nuance which makes a piece come alive for
the listener.
The second half featured a rarely performed sonata by Lalo.
Although pleasant enough, it was put in the shadow by the beauty
and excitement of the Franck. The performance was fully adequate
and it was nice to hear a different and slightly unusual work.
High Camp
The scheduled part of the program concluded with a dazzling
performance of the Saint-Saens "Rondo Cappricioso." Here is a piece
that really showcases the fiddler and evokes the demonic spirit of
Paganini. It is replete with rapid scales set against klip-klop rhythms,
emotionally laden melodies with heavy saccharine thirds and an
exhilarating sprint to the finish. In short, it was high camp.
In response to the tumultuous applause, the audience was treated
to more wonderful playing; a Brahms sonata movement and the
"Movement Perpetuel" by Poulenc. A truly first class recital by two
superb artists.

The most impressive place of the evening from a musical point of
view was Franck's eternally popular Sonata in A major. This piece, a
bastion of violin literature, is as demanding for the pianist as it is for
the violinist, and it was Kantorow's good fortune to have at the
keyboard a pianist of Francoise Regnat's calibre. It was in this piece
that the special Frenchness of the performers emerged. Although the
piece is richly romantic and loaded with emotion, the performers
never let it overstep the boundary of good taste. The opening
movement was particularly lovely. It had beautiful tone, and was full
of the refined and gentle nuance which makes a piece come alive for
the listener.
The second half featured a rarely performed sonata by Lalo.
Although pleasant enough, it was put in the shadow by the beauty
and excitement of the Franck. The performance was fully adequate
and it was nice to hear a different and slightly unusual work.
High Camp
The scheduled part of the program concluded with a dazzling
performance of the Saint-Saens "Rondo Cappricioso." Here is a piece
that really showcases the fiddler and evokes the demonic spirit of
Paganini. It is replete with rapid scales set against klip-klop rhythms,
emotionally laden melodies with heavy saccharine thirds and an
exhilarating sprint to the finish. In short, it was high camp.
In response to the tumultuous applause, the audience was treated
to more wonderful playing; a Brahms sonata movement and the
"Movement Perpetuel" by Poulenc. A truly first class recital by two
superb artists.
