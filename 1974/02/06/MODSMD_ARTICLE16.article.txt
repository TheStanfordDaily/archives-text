# Dave Mason, Nash, Garner Three Winterland Encores

### JOE STRATON 
SAN FRANCISCO - Dave
Mason's concert at Winterland
Jan. 19 was another example of
one of the myriad
accompaniments to being part of
this pie-in-the-sky known as
Stanford; viz., the accessibility of
good concerts featuring good
artists and rowdy crowds. The
Dave Mason concert provided
empirical evidence.
The concert began
inauspiciously with an
up-and-down elevator-like
performance from Livingston
Taylor. Most notable was the
versatility of the band. Assisting
Taylor were piano player Bill
Elliot and bassist Walter
Robinson. Taylor exhibited some
versatility of his own, playing a
couple of banjo tunes and a flute
encore although his vocals and his
song selection were unimpressive.
He still seems to strive for the
James Taylor sound with mixed
results, and when the band broke
into a hearty rendition of
"Somewhere Over The Rainbow"
one could only hope that the
wicked witch of the west would
appear to put an end to the
degradation.
Quality Descends
Musical quality continued to
descend with the performance of
the next group, Dalton and
Dubarri. Their first song proved to
be their best, a foot-stomping
rock and roll tune reminiscent of

Marshall Tucker's "Hillbilly
Band." Although initially
impressive, as the set progressed
so did reviewer disillusionment.
After a short break Dave
Mason came onstage alone with
his 12-string guitar. Promising to
play some old songs and some
new ones, Mason played "Alone
Together" from his first solo
album of the same name. With the
first chords it was clear that some
fine music was going to be heard.
Craegar, Nash
For his next song, "World in
Changes," Mason brought out one
of his sidemen, guitarist Jim
Craeger. Throughout the
performance Craeger generally
played a second lead blending his
parts with Mason's to produce a
sound remarkably like that on
Mason's new album, Its Like You
Never Left where Mason plays
two guitar parts on each track.
Mike Finnegann, a fine organ
player and singer, came out next
to back Mason on vocals for
another old song, "Sad and Deep
as You." Graham Nash was also
introduced, singing harmony for
the next few songs. Most were
songs from Mason's new album,
like "Maybe," "Lonely One," and
"Everywoman." The crowd was
electrified.
Following this acoustic set
Mason brought out a bass player
and a drummer, plugged in his
electric guitar, and proceded to

play exquisite music. Both Mason
and Craeger were smooth and
notable on the new "Misty
Morning Stranger" and the classic
"All along the Watchtower"
which Mason performed in
"honor of two great musicians."
Three Encores
Realizing that the crowd was
nearly in a frenzy, Mason picked
up the pace with some familiar
rockers: "Pearly Queen," "Look
at You, Look at Me," and "Feelin
Alright." The noise was
thunderous as the group left the
stage. It was obvious that the
audience was not ready to leave.
If the encore is a representation of
demand, Dave Mason was in
demand. Graham Nash returned
for the encore "Baby ... Please,"
another new song.
Again the applause was
overwhelming, resulting in
another encore. The second
encore, "Only You Know and I
Know," Mason dedicated to
Timothy Leary. Again the
audience refused to leave and
brought Mason back for still
another encore. The last song was
an old Spencer Davis' song,
"Gimme Some Lovin," Dave
Mason's performance transformed
an uneventful concert into a
memorable one.

"Everywoman." The crowd was
electrified.
Following this acoustic set
Mason brought out a bass player
and a drummer, plugged in his
electric guitar, and proceded to

play exquisite music. Both Mason
and Craeger were smooth and
notable on the new "Misty
Morning Stranger" and the classic
"All along the Watchtower"
which Mason performed in
"honor of two great musicians."
Three Encores
Realizing that the crowd was
nearly in a frenzy, Mason picked
up the pace with some familiar
rockers: "Pearly Queen," "Look
at You, Look at Me," and "Feelin
Alright." The noise was
thunderous as the group left the
stage. It was obvious that the
audience was not ready to leave.
If the encore is a representation of
demand, Dave Mason was in
demand. Graham Nash returned
for the encore "Baby ... Please,"
another new song.
Again the applause was
overwhelming, resulting in
another encore. The second
encore, "Only You Know and I
Know," Mason dedicated to
Timothy Leary. Again the
audience refused to leave and
brought Mason back for still
another encore. The last song was
an old Spencer Davis' song,
"Gimme Some Lovin," Dave
Mason's performance transformed
an uneventful concert into a
memorable one.
i
SAN FRANCISCO - Dave
Mason's concert at Winterland
Jan. 19 was another example of
one of the myriad
accompaniments to being part of
this pie-in-the-sky known as
Stanford; viz., the accessibility of
good concerts featuring good
artists and rowdy crowds. The
Dave Mason concert provided
empirical evidence.
The concert began
inauspiciously with an
up-and-down elevator-like
performance from Livingston
Taylor. Most notable was the
versatility of the band. Assisting
Taylor were piano player Bill
Elliot and bassist Walter
Robinson. Taylor exhibited some
versatility of his own, playing a
couple of banjo tunes and a flute
encore although his vocals and his
song selection were unimpressive.
He still seems to strive for the
James Taylor sound with mixed
results, and when the band broke
into a hearty rendition of
"Somewhere Over The Rainbow"
one could only hope that the
wicked witch of the west would
appear to put an end to the
degradation.
Quality Descends
Musical quality continued to
descend with the performance of
the next group, Dalton and
Dubarri. Their first song proved to
be their best, a foot-stomping
rock and roll tune reminiscent of

Marshall Tucker's "Hillbilly
Band." Although initially
impressive, as the set progressed
so did reviewer disillusionment.
After a short break Dave
Mason came onstage alone with
his 12-string guitar. Promising to
play some old songs and some
new ones, Mason played "Alone
Together" from his first solo
album of the same name. With the
first chords it was clear that some
fine music was going to be heard.
Craegar, Nash
For his next song, "World in
Changes," Mason brought out one
of his sidemen, guitarist Jim
Craeger. Throughout the
performance Craeger generally
played a second lead blending his
parts with Mason's to produce a
sound remarkably like that on
Mason's new album, Its Like You
Never Left where Mason plays
two guitar parts on each track.
Mike Finnegann, a fine organ
player and singer, came out next
to back Mason on vocals for
another old song, "Sad and Deep
as You." Graham Nash was also
introduced, singing harmony for
the next few songs. Most were
songs from Mason's new album,
like "Maybe," "Lonely One," and
"Everywoman." The crowd was
electrified.
