# Editor Firing Signals Mideast Settlement?
## 
### Associated Press 
President Anwar Sadat's
decision to dump editor
Mohammed Hassanein Heikal
suggests that Egypt's leader is
anxious to bring about some sort
of Middle East quiet so he can
turn his attention to his nation's
economy.
The removal of Heikal from
control of the semiofficial
newspaper A 1 Ahram indicates
that Sadat is trying to get off an
uncomfortable tightrope stretched
between his pledge to recover all
Arab territories lost to Israel in
1967 and his eagerness to get on
with building a viable Egyptian
economy.
It can also indicate that Sadat
is in earnest when he urges that
the Arab oil embargo against the
United States be eased. Heikal,
who had enormous influence,
used his high perch to lead a
campaign, long before the

October war, for the use of oil as
a weapon "to harm not only the
Israeli enemy, but also U.S.
interests in the Arab area."
Oddly, both Moscow and
Washington are likely pleased with
Sadat's action. The Russians
might have applauded Heikal's
anti-American blasts, but he had
also suggested that the Soviet
Union could be equally bad
medicine for Egypt.
Sadat is believed anxious for a
chance to better the lot of Egypt's
poor. He can't get going in an
atmosphere of military tension,
nor is he likely to attract Western
technology and investment while
an oil crisis continues to damage
Western economies.
Perhaps Sadat hadn't felt
strong enough politically to get
rid of Heikal before now,
although the editor obviously was
becoming a big problem for him.
