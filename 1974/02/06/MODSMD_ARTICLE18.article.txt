DOS A Case No. 28, November 5, 1973, Honor Code
The University Administration filed charges for a violation
of the Honor Code against two students who gave and
received unpermitted aid on a midterm examination. The
students admitted cheating on the examination and asked
the Dean of Student Affairs to hear their case. The dean
agreed to do so. The dean, with the consent of the profes
sor, recommended that one student, who had been primari
ly the giver of the unpermitted aid, be dropped from the
course in which the violation occurred. The dean, with the
consent of the professor, recommended that the second
student who had participated in the cheating to a greater
degree be dropped from the course in which the violation
occurred and that a work fine of 40 hours be levied. These
recommendations were approved by the President.
