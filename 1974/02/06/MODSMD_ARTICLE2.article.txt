# Students Vote Today On Row Plan
## 
### 
The student body will vote today
and tomorrow on whether or not they
support the proposed construction of
the controversial faculty housing
project on the Row.
Polling places for the referendum
today and tomorrow will be: Post
Office and Engineering Corner of the
Quad, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; History
Corner of the Quad and Physics Tank,
10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Med School, 11:45
a.m. to 12:45 p.m.; tomorrow, only,
for the Business School, 12 noon to 2
p.m.
Hurlbert (Grove) House, a student
residence slated for relocation, and the
Stanford daycare center building,
slated for relocation or destruction,
now occupy the proposed site. The
five acre lot borders student residences
on Mayfield Ave., and faculty
residences on Santa Ynez and
Salvatierra streets.
The proposed 100-unit complex
gives priority to emeriti faculty, senior
faculty and staff, visiting and junior
faculty in that order.
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend
admits there may be a problem getting
non-Row residents to vote, but he said
he hoped that at least 1500 students
would vote.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Richard Haskell was less optimistic.
"I've printed 1500 ballots, but I don't
expect to have to use more than 800,"
he said. Haskell said he thought the
referendum vote would be small
because of its limited publicity.
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance, criticized the
referendum for coming too late. He
said that objections to the project
should have come earlier "within the
system" through student members of
University committees.
"We cannot be held responsible if
students do not choose to involve
themselves or to respond," Augsburger
wrote in a letter to Friend.
Many students say it was the
responsibility of the Planning Office to
actively seek out opinions of Row
residents regardless of the charges of
student negligence.
These students say the Planning
Office consulted prospective residents
and the Stanford Homeowners'
Association, but not Row residents.
