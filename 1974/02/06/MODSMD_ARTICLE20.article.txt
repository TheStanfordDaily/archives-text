# Escondido Pool Considered
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
A swimming pool for Escondido Village
residents dominated informal discussions among
Palo Alto Assistant City Manager Charles Walker,
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams,
and Director of Escondido Village Alan Cummings,
Monday.
The three officials pondered a cooperative
recreation program to benefit students and Palo
Alto residents this summer. The project grew out of
a recent Stanford Liaison Committee meeting
where the topic was formally brought up.
The novel plan calls for the combination of the
city's "expertise" in the administration of
recreational programs with some of the University's
recreational facilities, according to Williams.
Williams emphasized that the city is primarily
interested in exchanging manpower and program
design for the use of University land. This would
mean people from the Palo Alto Recreational
Department could run programs on campus that
would be open to students and Palo Alto residents.
"We're more interested in a pool than they (the
City) are," said Williams. "The City already has five
or six pools, and it looks like they would not be
interested in financing the building of another
one."
Cummings, who believes that a pool is sorely
needed in Escondido Village, said, "It is obvious
that a pool for family use is different than a pool
for student use. We need to answer the question,
4 Are existing pools adequate? ' For family use, I
think not."

Walker said, "We've been looking into the
possibility of the Palo Alto High School pool.
There remains the question of availability, but I'm
sure we can overcome that."
Another problem, agreed upon by all officials, is
that the present high school pool is not shallow
enough to suit the needs of Gscondido Village
residents with young children.
Cummings said, "A swimming pool plan is not
contingent on this plan for City and University
cooperation. That the City may not finance the
building of a pool will not deter our efforts to get
one."
The next step in seeking funds for an Escondido
Village pool might be to look for possible financial
support from the University or to make residents
pay an assessment for pool construction along with
their rent, according to Williams.
Although the City may not be able to help solve
the pool needs of Escondido Village, it may be able
to provide programs for family student orientation
on campus, an area that has a large deficiency in
University coverage, according to Williams.
"Last summer a pilot program was set up in
Escondido Village that offered basic dance and
other activities for adults and children," said
Walker, who hopes for a more extensive program
this summer. Participation in last summer's
program was outstanding, according to Walker.
Williams or Cummings will now go to the
Facility and Planning Office and the Athletic
Department to find information about the
availability of University land. The three men
expect to meet again within the month.

program was outstanding, according to Walker.
Williams or Cummings will now go to the
Facility and Planning Office and the Athletic
Department to find information about the
availability of University land. The three men
expect to meet again within the month.
A swimming pool for Escondido Village
residents dominated informal discussions among
Palo Alto Assistant City Manager Charles Walker,
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams,
and Director of Escondido Village Alan Cummings,
Monday.
The three officials pondered a cooperative
recreation program to benefit students and Palo
Alto residents this summer. The project grew out of
a recent Stanford Liaison Committee meeting
where the topic was formally brought up.
The novel plan calls for the combination of the
city's "expertise" in the administration of
recreational programs with some of the University's
recreational facilities, according to Williams.
Williams emphasized that the city is primarily
interested in exchanging manpower and program
design for the use of University land. This would
mean people from the Palo Alto Recreational
Department could run programs on campus that
would be open to students and Palo Alto residents.
"We're more interested in a pool than they (the
City) are," said Williams. "The City already has five
or six pools, and it looks like they would not be
interested in financing the building of another
one."
Cummings, who believes that a pool is sorely
needed in Escondido Village, said, "It is obvious
that a pool for family use is different than a pool
for student use. We need to answer the question,
4 Are existing pools adequate? ' For family use, I
think not."

Walker said, "We've been looking into the
possibility of the Palo Alto High School pool.
There remains the question of availability, but I'm
sure we can overcome that."
Another problem, agreed upon by all officials, is
that the present high school pool is not shallow
enough to suit the needs of Gscondido Village
residents with young children.
Cummings said, "A swimming pool plan is not
contingent on this plan for City and University
cooperation. That the City may not finance the
building of a pool will not deter our efforts to get
one."
The next step in seeking funds for an Escondido
Village pool might be to look for possible financial
support from the University or to make residents
pay an assessment for pool construction along with
their rent, according to Williams.
Although the City may not be able to help solve
the pool needs of Escondido Village, it may be able
to provide programs for family student orientation
on campus, an area that has a large deficiency in
University coverage, according to Williams.
"Last summer a pilot program was set up in
Escondido Village that offered basic dance and
other activities for adults and children," said
Walker, who hopes for a more extensive program
this summer. Participation in last summer's
program was outstanding, according to Walker.
