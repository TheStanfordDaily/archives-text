# Nixon Sets Red Ink Record
## 
### Associated Press 
Once a firm advocate of the
balanced budget, Richard M.
Nixon has turned out to be the
greatest deficit spender in the
White House since Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
His red-ink record is a product
of a fundamental change in his
economic thinking and an
economy that is much more
complex, with the dollar worth
much less, than a generation ago.
Since Nixon took office in
1969, the government has

overspent its revenues by $63.4
billion. The total red ink will
reach about $68 billion when the
fiscal 1974 year ends June 30,
according to federal budget
officials.
On top of that, Nixon's
proposed budget for fiscal 1975
calls for a $9.4 billion deficit,
which would push the total of his
deficit spending to $77.4 billion
by June 30,1975.
Lyndon B. Johnson ranks
closest to Nixon for deficit
spending in the years since the

heavy World War II wartime
deficits. Johnson had federal
budget deficits totaling a net
$45.1 billion from 1964 to 1969.
President John F. Kennedy was
in office two fiscal years, 1962
and 1963, and had deficits both
times totaling $11.8 billion.
During his eight years in the
White House, Dwight D.
Eisenhower had deficits of $15.9
billion.
Harry S. Truman overspent
federal revenues by a net $1.5
billion.
