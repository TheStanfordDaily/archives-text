# Christiansen Gets Five-Year Contract
## 
### 
Jack Christiansen, after guiding
Stanford to 6-5 and 7-4 seasons
the past two years, has been
awarded a new five-year contract,
it was announced yesterday by
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz.
The following statement was
released by Ruetz:
"I am pleased to announce that
Jack Christiansen has been
awarded a new five-year contract
as head football coach at Stanford
University effective Feb. 1, 1974.
President Richard W. Lyman has
approved this recommendation.
Jack's original three-year contract
had been due to expire Feb. 1,

1975.
"This contract has been
awarded in recognition of Jack's
leadership, his knowledge of the
game, his ability to attract
outstanding assistant coaches to
serve with him... and their
genuine interest in the academic,
social and athletic welfare of the
student-athletes whom they teach.
"This contract in no way binds
Jack or his staff — as indeed
lifetime tenure does not bind any
professor — in the event they
receive offers of other
employment which they believe
can advance them in their
profession or be of assistance to
their personal family situation.
But it is evidence of how they are
regarded by this Department as
coaches, teachers and counselors
of student-athletes admitted to
this institution."
Christiansen, a Colorado Sta;e
graduate and a former All-Pro
performer with the Detroit Lions,
was "flattered to be offered a
five-year contract. I like to think
it's a vote of confidence for the
entire coaching staff," he said.
Christiansen, 45, served as head
coach of the San Francisco 49'ers
from 1963-67. He came to
Stanford as an assistant on John
Ralston's staff in the spring of
1968. He was promoted to the
head coaching post when Ralston
accepted the head job with the
Denver Broncos following
Stanford's 1972 Rose Bowl
victory over Michigan.
Chris said that the new
contract provides "stability for
myself and my assistants." He said
he's been "very happy'* in his two
years at Stanford, but didn't rule
out the possibility of returning to
pro football in the future.

serve with him... and their
genuine interest in the academic,
social and athletic welfare of the
student-athletes whom they teach.
"This contract in no way binds
Jack or his staff — as indeed
lifetime tenure does not bind any
professor — in the event they
receive offers of other
employment which they believe
can advance them in their
profession or be of assistance to
their personal family situation.
But it is evidence of how they are
regarded by this Department as
coaches, teachers and counselors
of student-athletes admitted to
this institution."
Christiansen, a Colorado Sta;e
graduate and a former All-Pro
performer with the Detroit Lions,
was "flattered to be offered a
five-year contract. I like to think
it's a vote of confidence for the
entire coaching staff," he said.
Christiansen, 45, served as head
coach of the San Francisco 49'ers
from 1963-67. He came to
Stanford as an assistant on John
Ralston's staff in the spring of
1968. He was promoted to the
head coaching post when Ralston
accepted the head job with the
Denver Broncos following
Stanford's 1972 Rose Bowl
victory over Michigan.
Chris said that the new
contract provides "stability for
myself and my assistants." He said
he's been "very happy'* in his two
years at Stanford, but didn't rule
out the possibility of returning to
pro football in the future.

COACH CHRIS — Football coach Jack Christiansen reaped the
benefits of 6-5 and 7-4 seasons yesterday when Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz announced that Chris would receive a new five-year contract.

A's, Christiansen can be released from the contract at any time.
