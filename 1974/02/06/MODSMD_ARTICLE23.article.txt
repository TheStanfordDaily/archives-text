# Sacto State Pins Matmen
## 
### 
Sacramento State's wrestlers
topped Stanford 27-17 last night,
as the Cards' record fell to 6-7-1.
Only six matches were actually
wrestled, as each squad forfeited
twice. Stanford's forfeit at 126
pounds was the most costly loss,
according to Coach Joe De Meo, as
Jim Tatarakis had previously
pinned his Sacramento opponent.
But Tatarakis did not show up for
the trip.
Reliable Mark Yancey (134)
recorded the Cards' only win on
the mat, 10-3. Charlie Masch
(150) fought back in the last 30
seconds to record a 3-3 tie.
Jim Rappaport (142) wrestled
a strong match, but was beaten
7-4. Marc Frelier (177) and Roy
Tolles (190) also lost. Kris
Westersund, going up against a
300-pound heavyweight, held on
until the last minute of his match,
when he was pinned.
