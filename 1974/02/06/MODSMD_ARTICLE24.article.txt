# Edge San Francisco, 8-6
## Skaters Snap Winless Streak 
### 
By QUIGLEY S. PETERSON
After suffering the frustrations
of an eight-game winless streak,
Stanford's ice hockey team
defeated the San Francisco Seals
8-6 Monday night in San
Francisco — a victory that marked
the conclusion of an amazing
six-day comeback.
A week ago yesterday, the
Belmont Buffies thrashed the
skating Cardinals 9-2 as KZSU
broadcasted its first live coverage
of Stanford ice hockey. It was
easily the worst effort Stanford
has turned in over the past three
years. To say the game was the
low point of the season would be
an understatement equivalent to
saying Watergate is a low point in
Mr. Nixon's career.
This performance gave
Stanford its third loss of the new
year and brought the Cards'
winless streak to seven games
(four losses, three ties). But it also
shook the Cards considerably. For
the past few outings, the team had
been more or less hoping for a
win.
Semi-awakened, Stanford
traveled to Sacramento Saturday
only to lose a fast, well-played

game to the much-improved
Royals by a score of 8-4. For the
first time in a month, the Cards
actually showed signs of life. With
a couple of breaks going
Stanford's way instead of
Sacramento's, the score could
easily have been reversed.
So Stanford was ready for the
big win Monday night. San
Francisco, the first place team in
the Bay Area Senior Hockey
League, hadn't lost a game at
home this year and hadn't lost to
the Cardinals at home in four
years — until Monday, when
Stanford rookie Jay Johnston
exploded for six goals to almost
single-handedly destroy the Seals.

Credit is due to Johnston's
linemates, Rich Jaros and
player-coach Pat Baldwin, who set
up Johnston all evening long.
Johnston notwithstanding, it was
a team effort. The Cards skated
with only 2 X A lines, but everyone
came through with near 100
percent efforts, as no one could
forget the previous week's loss to
Belmont.
This weekend, the Cards take
their big road trip of the year to
San Diego, where they will face
San Diego State. Stanford appears
ready for San Diego, which claims
to have the best college hockey
team in California.

League, hadn't lost a game at
home this year and hadn't lost to
the Cardinals at home in four
years — until Monday, when
Stanford rookie Jay Johnston
exploded for six goals to almost
single-handedly destroy the Seals.

Credit is due to Johnston's
linemates, Rich Jaros and
player-coach Pat Baldwin, who set
up Johnston all evening long.
Johnston notwithstanding, it was
a team effort. The Cards skated
with only 2 X A lines, but everyone
came through with near 100
percent efforts, as no one could
forget the previous week's loss to
Belmont.
This weekend, the Cards take
their big road trip of the year to
San Diego, where they will face
San Diego State. Stanford appears
ready for San Diego, which claims
to have the best college hockey
team in California.
