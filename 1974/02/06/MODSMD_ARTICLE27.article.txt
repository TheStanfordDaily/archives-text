## WFL: A Lawyer's Dream 
### Don Tollefson 
Just when it seemed that the monster of football
might finally slip into its cave and give millions of
Americans some much needed rest, the college
draft last week exploded into another pro sports
"war."
Having barely survived a barrage of criticism
over the boredom of Super Bowl VIII, the NFL last
week found itself seeking shelter from the
determined attack of yet another participant in the
infamous "Sports Wars" of the 70s. Like the
American Basketball Association and the World
Hockey Association before it, the new World
Football League is the brain child of
entrepreneurial lawyer Gary Davidson.
At this point one thing is certain about the WFL
â€” it has one hell of a public relations staff. The new
league's franchise line-up wasn't even complete
when the WFL put out a slick, 14-page brochure
which tells you Everything You've Always Wanted
to Know About Why the WFL Can't Miss. Like a
prospectus for a mutual fund, the brochure makes a
valiant attempt to convince you of the airtight logic
of the WFL's case, but I'm still a bit skeptical.
The new league does have some important things
going for it, especially the presence of Davidson,
who combines shrewd business and legal abilities
with a keen sports sense and a seemingly endless
supply of energy.
Rocky Times
Although his previous two sports babies, the
WHA and the ABA, have had their rocky times,
Davidson has done better with both than most
observers ever predicted he'd be able to. The WHA
has already reached a stature where a merger with
the NHL may occur in the very near future.
Although seed money for the new league will
not be that difficult to obtain, its long run viability
will depend on the kind of wide fan support that is
necessary for an investor to receive an attractive
return. As Davidson has said, "You buy a team in
anticipation of its future market value. Capital
appreciation is the big factor." That capital
appreciation requires wide public interest which is
the biggest question mark facing the WFL.
The histories of similar ventures, such as the
ABA, WHA or the old American Football League,
can provide minor clues to the chances of the WFL,

but attempting any broad correlation is naive.
Davidson points out that the first eight WHA teams
cost $25,000 and that by last summer, expansion
teams were going for $2 million. But pro hockey is
not pro football, In recent years there was clear
evidence of a demand for more pro hockey, but the
attractiveness of additional pro football is harder to
judge.
Mortal Wounds
The WFL plans to begin its schedule of
Wednesday and Thursday night games this summer
and I just don't know if that many people will be
interested. This will leave Tuesday as the only day
devoid of some kind of football, and by
lengthening an already mercilessly long football
season, the WFL may inflict mortal wounds on the
national psyche. Does America have a saturation
point or are we really a nation of football
masochists?
To further complicate its problems, the WFL
will have to attract fans to weeknight games
without the benefit of massive television exposure,
since the three networks all have apparently
binding commitments to the NFL which are worth
approximately $55 million. This may be the most
crucial difference between the WFL and the AFL,
since the latter really made it on the strength of a
healthy TV package and a wild-eyed quarterback
named Willie Joe Namath.
The WFL will have the kind of money needed to
attract some quality players and coaches and
Davidson is an extremely talented businessman, but
I am not sure the timing of his venture is optional
in a country showing some clear signs of football
weariness.
Perhaps only one thing about the new league can
be said in absolute certainty. The WFL will
definitely be a boom to the legal profession.
Whatever its fate, the league will allow hundreds of
lawyers to collect massive fees while arbitrating
disputes, just as has happened ad nauseum in pro
basketball and pro hockey. As lawyer's fees and
players' salaries climb, the already exorbitant prices
of tickets can only increase and we may soon find
out just how much the American sports consumer
will tolerate.
