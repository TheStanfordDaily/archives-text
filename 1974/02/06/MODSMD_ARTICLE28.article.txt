Truekers' Shutdown Continues
Negotiators for striking independent truckers
recommended in Washington last night that drivers
continue their nationwide shutdown. Violence continued,
with one driver shot and killed in his truck outside
Harrington, Del.
Drivers' negotiators rejected President Nixon's decision
to freeze diesel fuel prices. Leonard Fleet, attorney for the
Council of Independent Truckers, said the drivers wanted
assurances that the price freeze would remain in effect as
long as necessary until Congress had acted. He said the
truckers would not go back to work until they had
immediate authority to levy an additional five percent
surcharge on shipments.
Delaware State Police were investigating the death of a
trucker identified as Claudie Nix, 50, of St. Stevens, S.C.
They said he was shot in the chest through the left vent
window of his truck cab while he was driving on U.S. 13.
They said they were searching for a couple in a late model
auto in connection with the shooting.
More layoffs and pending food shortages were reported
as the increasingly violent strike continued.
Spokesmen for New England food stores predicted
yesterday afternoon there may be critical shortages of meat
and produce by the weekend if the shutdown, which has
touched 42 states, continues.
Layoffs continued at meat packers and industries
dependent upon trucking. More than 75,000 workers have
been furloughed since the shutdown over diesel prices and
freight rates began last Thursday.
The Senate Commerce Committee voted to spend
federal action to permit truckers to pass on increased fuel
costs to truck companies, and Pennsylvania said truckers
operating in its boundaries could tack on a two percent
surcharge to cover increased costs.
Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe said the Justice Department
would take steps to prevent the violence that has marred
the shutdown.
Newspaper Heiress Kidnapped
BERKELEY — Firing at witnesses as they went,
kidnapers dragged newspaper heiress Patricia Campbell
Hearst, 19, screaming from her apartment Monday night, it
was disclosed yesterday.
Authorities and the family awaited a ransom demand,
but none was reported.
During the raid, the kidnapers badly beat Miss Hearst's
fiance and beat and tied a neighbor who ran to their aid.
In full view of neighbors, the blindfolded and half-nude
victim \vas dumped into the trunk of a stolen car. The
empty car was later found seven blocks away.
"She was screaming, 'Please let me go,' " said Sandy
Golden, 21, who watched from the house next door.
Witnesses said up to 12 shots were fired in the
apparently well-planned 10-minute raid on the handsome
townhouse apartment building about a quarter-mile from
the University of California campus where Hearst is a
sophomore history major.
Hearst is the granddaughter of late publisher William
Randolph Hearst and daughter of Randolph A. Hearst,
president and editor of the San Francisco Examiner.
Tape Aeeess Request Answered
WASHINGTON — The White House has made a written
response to special Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski's
request for continued access to tapes and documents. A
meeting is scheduled later this week to resolve a growing
dispute.
The letter, from White House Watergate lawyer James D.
St. Clair was termed "a lengthy communication" by a
spokesman in the special prosecutor's office. The
spokesman said it "will require further clarification and
further discussion between Mr. Jaworski and Mr. St. Clair."
He added there will be no further comment until after
the meeting, expected when Jaworski returns from a trip to
Texas. There was no elaboration about what the letter said.

What is being sought by Jaworski isn't known and
neither the White House nor the special prosecutor will say.
After relaxing its grip on non-subpoenaed material late
last year even allowing an assistant special prosecutor to go
through a file cabinet — there has been an obvious
hardening in the White House attitude toward supplying all
that Jaworski is asking for.
President Nixon signaled that in his State of the Union
message when he said "I believe that I have provided all the
material that he [Jaworski] needs to conclude his
investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to
clear the innocent."
Riles Plans To Run A^ain
LOS ANGELES — Promising reform of junior and senior
high schools, Dr. Wilson Riles yesterday announced his
candidacy for re-election as California's superintendent of
public instruction.
The 55-year-old Riles, reading from a prepared
statement, said, "too often, in too many high schools, too
many students are bored — they have been kept and treated
as children too long ... the key to reform lies in treating
our young people as individuals."
Riles said he also advocates an increase in vocational
training and elimination of the "A-through-F" grading
system.
Riles also said he opposes incentive pay for teachers in
minority areas and said violence in the schools is more a
problem of society and not education.
Riles has no announced opponent for the nonpartisan
office.
"I would not want to lessen academic training," Riles
said regarding work-related education, "but I think we need
more work experience. Students should have an
opportunity to learn entry-level job skills."
The superintendent said "integration is a complex
problem." He said he feels California "should provide a
good education for all children and we should stop fretting
and fuming about integration."
Alioto's 'Jealous' Wife Returns
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto's wife said
Tuesday she vanished on an 18-day religious pilgrimage
because she was "jealous" of the mayor's lack of attention.
Angelina Alioto, a 58-year-old grandmother, told a news
conference at her luxurious Presidio Heights home that she
went off alone after a dinner in Palm Springs honoring her
husband Jan. 18 because he completely ignored her, their
son, Lawrence, and daughter-in-law, Ann.
"We were completely ignored. I thought we were an
asset. He was trying to hide us," she said. "Then he left that
evening and came back to San Francisco and left me with
my son and daughter-in-law who were supposed to be on
their second honeymoon.
"He should have made me come back with him or stayed
with me. So it was pure jealousy. It left me with anguish
and in my anguish I decided to take off."
The mayor's wife said she had no regrets about her
pilgrimage to 14 California missions.
Mrs. Alioto dropped out of sight Jan. 18 after she
checked out of La Siesta Villas, an exclusive $100-a-day
Palm Springs hotel, and drove off in a rented white car.

candidacy for re-election as California's superintendent of
public instruction.
The 55-year-old Riles, reading from a prepared
statement, said, "too often, in too many high schools, too
many students are bored — they have been kept and treated
as children too long ... the key to reform lies in treating
our young people as individuals."
Riles said he also advocates an increase in vocational
training and elimination of the "A-through-F" grading
system.
Riles also said he opposes incentive pay for teachers in
minority areas and said violence in the schools is more a
problem of society and not education.
Riles has no announced opponent for the nonpartisan
office.
"I would not want to lessen academic training," Riles
said regarding work-related education, "but I think we need
more work experience. Students should have an
opportunity to learn entry-level job skills."
The superintendent said "integration is a complex
problem." He said he feels California "should provide a
good education for all children and we should stop fretting
and fuming about integration."
Alioto's 'Jealous' Wife Returns
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto's wife said
Tuesday she vanished on an 18-day religious pilgrimage
because she was "jealous" of the mayor's lack of attention.
Angelina Alioto, a 58-year-old grandmother, told a news
conference at her luxurious Presidio Heights home that she
went off alone after a dinner in Palm Springs honoring her
husband Jan. 18 because he completely ignored her, their
son, Lawrence, and daughter-in-law, Ann.
"We were completely ignored. I thought we were an
asset. He was trying to hide us," she said. "Then he left that
evening and came back to San Francisco and left me with
my son and daughter-in-law who were supposed to be on
their second honeymoon.
"He should have made me come back with him or stayed
with me. So it was pure jealousy. It left me with anguish
and in my anguish I decided to take off."
The mayor's wife said she had no regrets about her
pilgrimage to 14 California missions.
Mrs. Alioto dropped out of sight Jan. 18 after she
checked out of La Siesta Villas, an exclusive $100-a-day
Palm Springs hotel, and drove off in a rented white car.

Truekers' Shutdown Continues
Negotiators for striking independent truckers
recommended in Washington last night that drivers
continue their nationwide shutdown. Violence continued,
with one driver shot and killed in his truck outside
Harrington, Del.
Drivers' negotiators rejected President Nixon's decision
to freeze diesel fuel prices. Leonard Fleet, attorney for the
Council of Independent Truckers, said the drivers wanted
assurances that the price freeze would remain in effect as
long as necessary until Congress had acted. He said the
truckers would not go back to work until they had
immediate authority to levy an additional five percent
surcharge on shipments.
Delaware State Police were investigating the death of a
trucker identified as Claudie Nix, 50, of St. Stevens, S.C.
They said he was shot in the chest through the left vent
window of his truck cab while he was driving on U.S. 13.
They said they were searching for a couple in a late model
auto in connection with the shooting.
More layoffs and pending food shortages were reported
as the increasingly violent strike continued.
Spokesmen for New England food stores predicted
yesterday afternoon there may be critical shortages of meat
and produce by the weekend if the shutdown, which has
touched 42 states, continues.
Layoffs continued at meat packers and industries
dependent upon trucking. More than 75,000 workers have
been furloughed since the shutdown over diesel prices and
freight rates began last Thursday.
The Senate Commerce Committee voted to spend
federal action to permit truckers to pass on increased fuel
costs to truck companies, and Pennsylvania said truckers
operating in its boundaries could tack on a two percent
surcharge to cover increased costs.
Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe said the Justice Department
would take steps to prevent the violence that has marred
the shutdown.
Newspaper Heiress Kidnapped
BERKELEY — Firing at witnesses as they went,
kidnapers dragged newspaper heiress Patricia Campbell
Hearst, 19, screaming from her apartment Monday night, it
was disclosed yesterday.
Authorities and the family awaited a ransom demand,
but none was reported.
During the raid, the kidnapers badly beat Miss Hearst's
fiance and beat and tied a neighbor who ran to their aid.
In full view of neighbors, the blindfolded and half-nude
victim \vas dumped into the trunk of a stolen car. The
empty car was later found seven blocks away.
"She was screaming, 'Please let me go,' " said Sandy
Golden, 21, who watched from the house next door.
Witnesses said up to 12 shots were fired in the
apparently well-planned 10-minute raid on the handsome
townhouse apartment building about a quarter-mile from
the University of California campus where Hearst is a
sophomore history major.
Hearst is the granddaughter of late publisher William
Randolph Hearst and daughter of Randolph A. Hearst,
president and editor of the San Francisco Examiner.
Tape Aeeess Request Answered
WASHINGTON — The White House has made a written
response to special Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski's
request for continued access to tapes and documents. A
meeting is scheduled later this week to resolve a growing
dispute.
The letter, from White House Watergate lawyer James D.
St. Clair was termed "a lengthy communication" by a
spokesman in the special prosecutor's office. The
spokesman said it "will require further clarification and
further discussion between Mr. Jaworski and Mr. St. Clair."
He added there will be no further comment until after
the meeting, expected when Jaworski returns from a trip to
Texas. There was no elaboration about what the letter said.

What is being sought by Jaworski isn't known and
neither the White House nor the special prosecutor will say.
After relaxing its grip on non-subpoenaed material late
last year even allowing an assistant special prosecutor to go
through a file cabinet — there has been an obvious
hardening in the White House attitude toward supplying all
that Jaworski is asking for.
President Nixon signaled that in his State of the Union
message when he said "I believe that I have provided all the
material that he [Jaworski] needs to conclude his
investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to
clear the innocent."

touched 42 states, continues.
Layoffs continued at meat packers and industries
dependent upon trucking. More than 75,000 workers have
been furloughed since the shutdown over diesel prices and
freight rates began last Thursday.
The Senate Commerce Committee voted to spend
federal action to permit truckers to pass on increased fuel
costs to truck companies, and Pennsylvania said truckers
operating in its boundaries could tack on a two percent
surcharge to cover increased costs.
Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe said the Justice Department
would take steps to prevent the violence that has marred
the shutdown.
Newspaper Heiress Kidnapped
BERKELEY — Firing at witnesses as they went,
kidnapers dragged newspaper heiress Patricia Campbell
Hearst, 19, screaming from her apartment Monday night, it
was disclosed yesterday.
Authorities and the family awaited a ransom demand,
but none was reported.
During the raid, the kidnapers badly beat Miss Hearst's
fiance and beat and tied a neighbor who ran to their aid.
In full view of neighbors, the blindfolded and half-nude
victim \vas dumped into the trunk of a stolen car. The
empty car was later found seven blocks away.
"She was screaming, 'Please let me go,' " said Sandy
Golden, 21, who watched from the house next door.
Witnesses said up to 12 shots were fired in the
apparently well-planned 10-minute raid on the handsome
townhouse apartment building about a quarter-mile from
the University of California campus where Hearst is a
sophomore history major.
Hearst is the granddaughter of late publisher William
Randolph Hearst and daughter of Randolph A. Hearst,
president and editor of the San Francisco Examiner.
Tape Aeeess Request Answered
WASHINGTON — The White House has made a written
response to special Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski's
request for continued access to tapes and documents. A
meeting is scheduled later this week to resolve a growing
dispute.
The letter, from White House Watergate lawyer James D.
St. Clair was termed "a lengthy communication" by a
spokesman in the special prosecutor's office. The
spokesman said it "will require further clarification and
further discussion between Mr. Jaworski and Mr. St. Clair."
He added there will be no further comment until after
the meeting, expected when Jaworski returns from a trip to
Texas. There was no elaboration about what the letter said.

What is being sought by Jaworski isn't known and
neither the White House nor the special prosecutor will say.
After relaxing its grip on non-subpoenaed material late
last year even allowing an assistant special prosecutor to go
through a file cabinet — there has been an obvious
hardening in the White House attitude toward supplying all
that Jaworski is asking for.
President Nixon signaled that in his State of the Union
message when he said "I believe that I have provided all the
material that he [Jaworski] needs to conclude his
investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to
clear the innocent."
Riles Plans To Run A^ain
LOS ANGELES — Promising reform of junior and senior
high schools, Dr. Wilson Riles yesterday announced his
candidacy for re-election as California's superintendent of
public instruction.
The 55-year-old Riles, reading from a prepared
statement, said, "too often, in too many high schools, too
many students are bored — they have been kept and treated
as children too long ... the key to reform lies in treating
our young people as individuals."
Riles said he also advocates an increase in vocational
training and elimination of the "A-through-F" grading
system.
Riles also said he opposes incentive pay for teachers in
minority areas and said violence in the schools is more a
problem of society and not education.
Riles has no announced opponent for the nonpartisan
office.
"I would not want to lessen academic training," Riles
said regarding work-related education, "but I think we need
more work experience. Students should have an
opportunity to learn entry-level job skills."
The superintendent said "integration is a complex
problem." He said he feels California "should provide a
good education for all children and we should stop fretting
and fuming about integration."
Alioto's 'Jealous' Wife Returns
SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto's wife said
Tuesday she vanished on an 18-day religious pilgrimage
because she was "jealous" of the mayor's lack of attention.
Angelina Alioto, a 58-year-old grandmother, told a news
conference at her luxurious Presidio Heights home that she
went off alone after a dinner in Palm Springs honoring her
husband Jan. 18 because he completely ignored her, their
son, Lawrence, and daughter-in-law, Ann.
"We were completely ignored. I thought we were an
asset. He was trying to hide us," she said. "Then he left that
evening and came back to San Francisco and left me with
my son and daughter-in-law who were supposed to be on
their second honeymoon.
"He should have made me come back with him or stayed
with me. So it was pure jealousy. It left me with anguish
and in my anguish I decided to take off."
The mayor's wife said she had no regrets about her
pilgrimage to 14 California missions.
Mrs. Alioto dropped out of sight Jan. 18 after she
checked out of La Siesta Villas, an exclusive $100-a-day
Palm Springs hotel, and drove off in a rented white car.

Truekers' Shutdown Continues
Negotiators for striking independent truckers
recommended in Washington last night that drivers
continue their nationwide shutdown. Violence continued,
with one driver shot and killed in his truck outside
Harrington, Del.
Drivers' negotiators rejected President Nixon's decision
to freeze diesel fuel prices. Leonard Fleet, attorney for the
Council of Independent Truckers, said the drivers wanted
assurances that the price freeze would remain in effect as
long as necessary until Congress had acted. He said the
truckers would not go back to work until they had
immediate authority to levy an additional five percent
surcharge on shipments.
Delaware State Police were investigating the death of a
trucker identified as Claudie Nix, 50, of St. Stevens, S.C.
They said he was shot in the chest through the left vent
window of his truck cab while he was driving on U.S. 13.
They said they were searching for a couple in a late model
auto in connection with the shooting.
More layoffs and pending food shortages were reported
as the increasingly violent strike continued.
Spokesmen for New England food stores predicted
yesterday afternoon there may be critical shortages of meat
and produce by the weekend if the shutdown, which has

SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Joseph L. Alioto's wife said
Tuesday she vanished on an 18-day religious pilgrimage
because she was "jealous" of the mayor's lack of attention.
Angelina Alioto, a 58-year-old grandmother, told a news
conference at her luxurious Presidio Heights home that she
went off alone after a dinner in Palm Springs honoring her
husband Jan. 18 because he completely ignored her, their
son, Lawrence, and daughter-in-law, Ann.
"We were completely ignored. I thought we were an
asset. He was trying to hide us," she said. "Then he left that
evening and came back to San Francisco and left me with
my son and daughter-in-law who were supposed to be on
their second honeymoon.
"He should have made me come back with him or stayed
with me. So it was pure jealousy. It left me with anguish
and in my anguish I decided to take off."
The mayor's wife said she had no regrets about her
pilgrimage to 14 California missions.
Mrs. Alioto dropped out of sight Jan. 18 after she
checked out of La Siesta Villas, an exclusive $100-a-day
Palm Springs hotel, and drove off in a rented white car.
