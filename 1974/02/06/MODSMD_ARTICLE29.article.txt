# Journalist Luce Forecasts US Bombing In Vietnam
## 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
"I suspect that the U.S. government
will go in and bomb [Vietnam]
again," predicted journalist Don Luce,
a specialist on Vietnamese affairs.
Luce made this assessment of
Vietnam's future in a speech to about
150 persons in the Tresidder Memorial
Union Large Lounge yesterday
evening.
The political future of South
Vietnam "depends on what we do,"
Luce said. If the U.S. stopped sending
military aid to Siagon, a three-part
coalition would probably emerge, he
said. The coalition government would
consist of representatives of the
present Saigon regime, the Provisional
Revolutionary Government (the PRG),
and members of the religious and
intellectual communities.
"What is more likely," Luce
warned, is "the U.S. will keep sending
bombs, which will provoke the PRG
into a military response." Eventually,
Luce said, the U.S. would be likely to
resume bombing in South Vietnam.
The PRG is a coalition of the
National Liberation Front and the
Alliance of National, Democratic, and
Peace Forces and was formed in 1969
in opposition to the Thieu regime and
American intervention. The PRG,
Luce said, now controls about 70
percent of the land area of South
Vietnam, though the Saigon
government still controls the major
cities and, therefore, most of the
population.
The U.S. intends to send Saigon
$2.7 billion in aid during fiscal 1974,
Luce said, and 99 percent of that
money is allocated to the military.
This military aid is one of many
American and South Vietnamese
violations of the Paris Peace
Agreement, he added.
Other violations of the agreement
include South Vietnam President
Thieu's refusal to release an estimated
200,000 political prisoners, Luce said.
Thieu has tried to circumvent this
issue, he added, by changing civil
charges against the prisoners to
criminal ones.
Luce, 39, has spent most of the last
fifteen years in Vietnam. He recently
returned from a one-month visit to
North Vietnam and parts of the
PRG-controlled south. Luce's visa had
been permanently revoked by the
Saigon government following his
uncovery of the Con Son prison "tiger
cages" in 1970. Therefore, Luce
entered the South via the Ho Chi Minh
trail.
Luce is touring American college
campuses lecturing on the need for
concerned Americans "to organize and
to work with each other" to end
American involvement in the
continuing war in Vietnam.
