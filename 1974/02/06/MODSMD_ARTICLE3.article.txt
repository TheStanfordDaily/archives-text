# Live Oak Money
## Publication Funds Disputed 
### DON COX 
Confusion and controversy flared
among ASSU Publications Board
members yesterday when it was
reported that one source of financial
support for the new publication Live
Oak did not actually exist, seemingly
contradicting earlier statements of
Live Oak editor and advertising
manager Bill Weinstein.
KZSU News Director Pete Williams
had reported in his Monday night
newscast that Lowell Berry, a leader of
the conservative New Founders League
(NFL) had not arranged $2000 in
financial support for Live Oak.
According to some Pub Board
members and observers, Weinstein had
stated the opposite in last Thursday's
Pub Board meeting.
Weinstein asserted yesterday that
he must have been misunderstood at
the meeting and that he had actually
said that he had received a $2000
pledge from Stanford Advocates, a
libertarian student group here.
Weinstein said that he had mentioned
Berry as a source of information about
people who might be willing to
contribute to Live Oak. The Daily was
not able to contact representatives of
the Stanford Advocates yesterday.
Former Daily Editor Jim Wascher
maintained that he "specifically
remembered" Weinstein had said "a
group represented by Berry had
pledged $2000." Wascher said he felt
he had been "deliberately misled."
A Daily news article last Friday also
reported that Weinstein had said a
group represented by Berry had
pledged the money.

Berry, contacted by the Daily
yesterday, said that he had never
talked to Weinstein personally and had
only heard of the Live Oak indirectly
from someone in the NFL.
Weinstein explained yesterday that
he had not talked to Berry but rather
to his secretary, and that she had
received all information on Live Oak
Berry indicated that he personally had
not received this information.
"I don't think I deceived the Pub
Board," said Weinstein, who
maintained that he had just been
misunderstood.
Berry told KZSU that he heard the
Live Oak might Ld « successor io the
conservative publication the Arena.
Weinstein, however, denied that this
was the case and said he would refuse
any funds that came with political
strings attached.
Weinstein said the new publication
would be published weekly and would
offer news, features and opinions "sort
of like the San Francisco Bay
Guardian."
While Weinstein said yesterday that
Live Oak would not serve as a
competitor to the Daily, Dale Snape,
assistant to the dean of student affairs,
said the University had earlier refused
a request by Weinstein for funds on
the grounds that Live Oak would be a
major competitor.
Snape indicated the University was
reluctant to fund any publication that
could do the Daily major damage,
since, he said, the Daily was essential
to effectively communicate with the
University community.
Snape also recalled Weinstein's

mention of the Berry pledge. Snape
said he was puzzled by the pledge, and
indicated to University officials in a
rnemo that he was "curious that a
group would fund a paper and not be
interested in the type of paper or the
non-deductable nature of the
contribution."
Snape was, however, "not sure that
[the matter of the Berry pledge] was a
critical point anyway. The point is
whether he's got the financial
support."
Rich Jaroslovsky, Daily editor, felt
that in light of the developments,
another investigation was needed and
"further Pub Board action" should be
considered. Among possible actions
was the reconsideration of the Live
Oak grant.
Jaroslovsky — who did not assume
Pub Board voting membership until
after last week's meeting — said he was
"appalled at the last Pub Board
meeting, in that so many questions
remained unanswered" about
Weinstein's proposal.
Jaroslovsky said it would be
"common sense to suspend the Pub
Board decision and investigate. The
whole thing could just be a
misunderstanding, but the situation is
very muddled."
"The fact that the Pub Board had
excess funds played a very important
part in the decision" to give the Live
Oak funds, Mike Kruger, Daily
business manager, said. The ample
funds available probably steered Pub
Board members into giving less
consideration to the Live Oak
proposal.
Mark Lee, editor of the Chaparral
said that he thought the Live Oak's
financing proposal "looked
reasonable." Lee said he did not see
any reason to reconsider the Live Oak
grant.
Snape didn't think the Pub Board
needed to reconsider the grant either.
He did say that David Martin, ASSU
financial manager, should go over
Weinstein's financing plan.
Weinstein said yesterday that the

only firm financial support the Live
Oak has received to date is the $1500
from the Pub Board and the $2000
from the Stanford Advocates.
Kruger had said at last week's Pub
Board meeting that he opposed the
disbursement of funds to Live Oak
because of a lack of a satisfactory
demonstration of business and
editorial viability.

whether he's got the financial
support."
Rich Jaroslovsky, Daily editor, felt
that in light of the developments,
another investigation was needed and
"further Pub Board action" should be
considered. Among possible actions
was the reconsideration of the Live
Oak grant.
Jaroslovsky — who did not assume
Pub Board voting membership until
after last week's meeting — said he was
"appalled at the last Pub Board
meeting, in that so many questions
remained unanswered" about
Weinstein's proposal.
Jaroslovsky said it would be
"common sense to suspend the Pub
Board decision and investigate. The
whole thing could just be a
misunderstanding, but the situation is
very muddled."
"The fact that the Pub Board had
excess funds played a very important
part in the decision" to give the Live
Oak funds, Mike Kruger, Daily
business manager, said. The ample
funds available probably steered Pub
Board members into giving less
consideration to the Live Oak
proposal.
Mark Lee, editor of the Chaparral
said that he thought the Live Oak's
financing proposal "looked
reasonable." Lee said he did not see
any reason to reconsider the Live Oak
grant.
Snape didn't think the Pub Board
needed to reconsider the grant either.
He did say that David Martin, ASSU
financial manager, should go over
Weinstein's financing plan.
Weinstein said yesterday that the

only firm financial support the Live
Oak has received to date is the $1500
from the Pub Board and the $2000
from the Stanford Advocates.
Kruger had said at last week's Pub
Board meeting that he opposed the
disbursement of funds to Live Oak
because of a lack of a satisfactory
demonstration of business and
editorial viability.
Confusion and controversy flared
among ASSU Publications Board
members yesterday when it was
reported that one source of financial
support for the new publication Live
Oak did not actually exist, seemingly
contradicting earlier statements of
Live Oak editor and advertising
manager Bill Weinstein.
KZSU News Director Pete Williams
had reported in his Monday night
newscast that Lowell Berry, a leader of
the conservative New Founders League
(NFL) had not arranged $2000 in
financial support for Live Oak.
According to some Pub Board
members and observers, Weinstein had
stated the opposite in last Thursday's
Pub Board meeting.
Weinstein asserted yesterday that
he must have been misunderstood at
the meeting and that he had actually
said that he had received a $2000
pledge from Stanford Advocates, a
libertarian student group here.
Weinstein said that he had mentioned
Berry as a source of information about
people who might be willing to
contribute to Live Oak. The Daily was
not able to contact representatives of
the Stanford Advocates yesterday.
Former Daily Editor Jim Wascher
maintained that he "specifically
remembered" Weinstein had said "a
group represented by Berry had
pledged $2000." Wascher said he felt
he had been "deliberately misled."
A Daily news article last Friday also
reported that Weinstein had said a
group represented by Berry had
pledged the money.

Berry, contacted by the Daily
yesterday, said that he had never
talked to Weinstein personally and had
only heard of the Live Oak indirectly
from someone in the NFL.
Weinstein explained yesterday that
he had not talked to Berry but rather
to his secretary, and that she had
received all information on Live Oak
Berry indicated that he personally had
not received this information.
"I don't think I deceived the Pub
Board," said Weinstein, who
maintained that he had just been
misunderstood.
Berry told KZSU that he heard the
Live Oak might Ld « successor io the
conservative publication the Arena.
Weinstein, however, denied that this
was the case and said he would refuse
any funds that came with political
strings attached.
Weinstein said the new publication
would be published weekly and would
offer news, features and opinions "sort
of like the San Francisco Bay
Guardian."
While Weinstein said yesterday that
Live Oak would not serve as a
competitor to the Daily, Dale Snape,
assistant to the dean of student affairs,
said the University had earlier refused
a request by Weinstein for funds on
the grounds that Live Oak would be a
major competitor.
Snape indicated the University was
reluctant to fund any publication that
could do the Daily major damage,
since, he said, the Daily was essential
to effectively communicate with the
University community.
Snape also recalled Weinstein's

mention of the Berry pledge. Snape
said he was puzzled by the pledge, and
indicated to University officials in a
rnemo that he was "curious that a
group would fund a paper and not be
interested in the type of paper or the
non-deductable nature of the
contribution."
Snape was, however, "not sure that
[the matter of the Berry pledge] was a

Berry, contacted by the Daily
yesterday, said that he had never
talked to Weinstein personally and had
only heard of the Live Oak indirectly
from someone in the NFL.
Weinstein explained yesterday that
he had not talked to Berry but rather
to his secretary, and that she had
received all information on Live Oak
Berry indicated that he personally had
not received this information.
"I don't think I deceived the Pub
Board," said Weinstein, who
maintained that he had just been
misunderstood.
Berry told KZSU that he heard the
Live Oak might Ld « successor io the
conservative publication the Arena.
Weinstein, however, denied that this
was the case and said he would refuse
any funds that came with political
strings attached.
Weinstein said the new publication
would be published weekly and would
offer news, features and opinions "sort
of like the San Francisco Bay
Guardian."
While Weinstein said yesterday that
Live Oak would not serve as a
competitor to the Daily, Dale Snape,
assistant to the dean of student affairs,
said the University had earlier refused
a request by Weinstein for funds on
the grounds that Live Oak would be a
major competitor.
Snape indicated the University was
reluctant to fund any publication that
could do the Daily major damage,
since, he said, the Daily was essential
to effectively communicate with the
University community.
Snape also recalled Weinstein's

mention of the Berry pledge. Snape
said he was puzzled by the pledge, and
indicated to University officials in a
rnemo that he was "curious that a
group would fund a paper and not be
interested in the type of paper or the
non-deductable nature of the
contribution."
Snape was, however, "not sure that
[the matter of the Berry pledge] was a
critical point anyway. The point is
whether he's got the financial
support."
Rich Jaroslovsky, Daily editor, felt
that in light of the developments,
another investigation was needed and
"further Pub Board action" should be
considered. Among possible actions
was the reconsideration of the Live
Oak grant.
Jaroslovsky — who did not assume
Pub Board voting membership until
after last week's meeting — said he was
"appalled at the last Pub Board
meeting, in that so many questions
remained unanswered" about
Weinstein's proposal.
Jaroslovsky said it would be
"common sense to suspend the Pub
Board decision and investigate. The
whole thing could just be a
misunderstanding, but the situation is
very muddled."
"The fact that the Pub Board had
excess funds played a very important
part in the decision" to give the Live
Oak funds, Mike Kruger, Daily
business manager, said. The ample
funds available probably steered Pub
Board members into giving less
consideration to the Live Oak
proposal.
Mark Lee, editor of the Chaparral
said that he thought the Live Oak's
financing proposal "looked
reasonable." Lee said he did not see
any reason to reconsider the Live Oak
grant.
Snape didn't think the Pub Board
needed to reconsider the grant either.
He did say that David Martin, ASSU
financial manager, should go over
Weinstein's financing plan.
Weinstein said yesterday that the

only firm financial support the Live
Oak has received to date is the $1500
from the Pub Board and the $2000
from the Stanford Advocates.
Kruger had said at last week's Pub
Board meeting that he opposed the
disbursement of funds to Live Oak
because of a lack of a satisfactory
demonstration of business and
editorial viability.
