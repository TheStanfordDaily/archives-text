# Live Oak Money
## Publication Funds Disputed 
### DON COX 
Confusion and controversy flared
among ASSU Publications Board
members yesterday when it was
reported that one source of financial
support for the new publication Live
Oak did not actually exist, seemingly
contradicting earlier statements of
Live Oak editor and advertising
manager Bill Weinstein.
KZSU News Director Pete Williams
had reported in his Monday night
newscast that Lowell Berry, a leader of
the conservative New Founders League
(NFL) had not arranged $2000 in
financial support for Live Oak.
According to some Pub Board
members and observers, Weinstein had
stated the opposite in last Thursday's
Pub Board meeting.
Weinstein asserted yesterday that
he must have been misunderstood at
the meeting and that he had actually
said that he had received a $2000
pledge from Stanford Advocates, a
libertarian student group here.
Weinstein said that he had mentioned
Berry as a source of information about
people who might be willing to
contribute to Live Oak. The Daily was
not able to contact representatives of
the Stanford Advocates yesterday.
Former Daily Editor Jim Wascher
maintained that he "specifically
remembered" Weinstein had said "a
group represented by Berry had
pledged $2000." Wascher said he felt
he had been "deliberately misled."
A Daily news article last Friday also
reported that Weinstein had said a
group represented by Berry had
pledged the money.

Berry, contacted by the Daily
yesterday, said that he had never
talked to Weinstein personally and had
only heard of the Live Oak indirectly
from someone in the NFL.
Weinstein explained yesterday that
he had not talked to Berry but rather
to his secretary, and that she had
received all information on Live Oak
Berry indicated that he personally had
not received this information.
"I don't think I deceived the Pub
Board," said Weinstein, who
maintained that he had just been
misunderstood.
Berry told KZSU that he heard the
Live Oak might Ld « successor io the
conservative publication the Arena.
Weinstein, however, denied that this
was the case and said he would refuse
any funds that came with political
strings attached.
Weinstein said the new publication
would be published weekly and would
offer news, features and opinions "sort
of like the San Francisco Bay
Guardian."
While Weinstein said yesterday that
Live Oak would not serve as a
competitor to the Daily, Dale Snape,
assistant to the dean of student affairs,
said the University had earlier refused
a request by Weinstein for funds on
the grounds that Live Oak would be a
major competitor.
Snape indicated the University was
reluctant to fund any publication that
could do the Daily major damage,
since, he said, the Daily was essential
to effectively communicate with the
University community.
Snape also recalled Weinstein's

mention of the Berry pledge. Snape
said he was puzzled by the pledge, and
indicated to University officials in a
rnemo that he was "curious that a
group would fund a paper and not be
interested in the type of paper or the
non-deductable nature of the
contribution."
Snape was, however, "not sure that
[the matter of the Berry pledge] was a
critical point anyway. The point is
whether he's got the financial
