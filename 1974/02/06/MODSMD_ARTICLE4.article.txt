# Oregon Governor Offers Alternative Energy Plan
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Oregon Gov. Tom McCall said
yesterday that selling gasoline on
alternate days to motorists with odd
and even-numbered license plates
could be "a step that would prevent
coupon rationing."
Speaking at a press conference
which preceded his address last night
before nearly 700 people in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, McCall said
the odd-even system has been in effect
on a voluntary basis in Oregon for
several months and has been the "most
satisfying solution of a simple nature
to meet a chaotic problem."
Gas dealers in Santa Clara,
Monterey and Santa Cruz counties
plan to adopt the license plate gasoline
rationing plan on a voluntary basis
beginning Monday. McCall said
Hawaii, Massachusetts and portions of
Washington and New Jersey have also
adopted the plan, which is "working

like a semi-miracle in Oregon."
Fearing "possibly a billion dollars
in additional costs to run the
bureaucracy" needed for a coupon
rationing system, McCall said he
"certainly would hate to see coupon
rationing until they have tried" the
odd-even system.
California
McCall, a Republican, said the
voluntary license plate system "leaves
rationing in the hands of the people
most visibly and vitally affected — the
motorists and the service station
operators."
In his prepared speech, the annual
Kate Herrick Maddox Distinguished
Lecture, McCall said he is continually
asking Oregonians "to conserve
electricity with one consequence — to
save and send those savings to
California.
"Then in turn, Californians will
bum less oil to create electricity, and
— if life is indeed fair — some of that
oil will be turned into gasoline or
diesel oil and sent to the state of
Oregon," McCall said.
Ideal Relationship
During the press conference, McCall
said such an arrangement would be
"the ideal of interstate relationships."
As part of the state's overall effort
to conserve energy', McCall "issued an
Executive Order prohibiting the use of
electricity for display lighting."
According to McCall, Interior
Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton said the
order was a "dramatic and necessary
move, whether legal or not."
McCall said "people in our state
were pleased by the ban, and they did
start to trim their thermostat settings,
and they abided by my admonition to
drive at not more than 55 m.p.h. The

public really grabbed this tiny straw
that I sailed into the wind and said,
'Okay, now we believe it. Now we'll
conserve.' "
Bottles And Cans
Mentioning Oregon's law
prohibiting non-returnable bottles and
cans, McCall asserted that "if the
nation had the same law, we could
save 68 percent of the energy saved by
lowering the national speed limit as we
are now doing."
The governor said he "could really
keep on the road. . . telling the
Oregon Story" across the country.
Responding to a question from the
audience after his speech, McCall said
"if I have to end up running for
President to keep on spreading this
message, it would be a twist of fate. I
would not welcome it, but I would
accept it."
Observers have discussed McCall as
a potential contender for the
Republican presidential nomination in
1976 and also as a possible third party
candidate for the presidency. Indeed,
McCall repeatedly referred to a "third
force" and said the two major parties
were "a little outmoded and worn."
McCall, who has had two cancer
operations in the last six months, said
he is testing his stamina by telling "the
Oregon Story" in frequent, out of
state appearances. He added that if his
health holds up through the rest of the
year, he "might consider actively
helping somebody be President." He
did not exclude himself as that person.
According to McCall, Oregon's
State Board of Higher Education "was
enlarged by two members" last month.
"The law, which I had tried to get
passed for five years, says the two
members must be students."

he is testing his stamina by telling "the

did not exclude himself as that person.

State Board of Higher Education "was

OREGON GOVERNOR'S ANSWER — In a press conference yesterday, Gov.
Tom McCall proposed selling gasoline on alternate days to motorists according
to the last digit on their license plates.
Oregon Gov. Tom McCall said
yesterday that selling gasoline on
alternate days to motorists with odd
and even-numbered license plates
could be "a step that would prevent
coupon rationing."
Speaking at a press conference
which preceded his address last night
before nearly 700 people in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, McCall said
the odd-even system has been in effect
on a voluntary basis in Oregon for
several months and has been the "most
satisfying solution of a simple nature
to meet a chaotic problem."
Gas dealers in Santa Clara,
Monterey and Santa Cruz counties
plan to adopt the license plate gasoline
rationing plan on a voluntary basis
beginning Monday. McCall said
Hawaii, Massachusetts and portions of
Washington and New Jersey have also
adopted the plan, which is "working

like a semi-miracle in Oregon."
Fearing "possibly a billion dollars
in additional costs to run the
bureaucracy" needed for a coupon
rationing system, McCall said he
"certainly would hate to see coupon
rationing until they have tried" the
odd-even system.
California
McCall, a Republican, said the
voluntary license plate system "leaves
rationing in the hands of the people
most visibly and vitally affected — the
motorists and the service station
operators."
In his prepared speech, the annual
Kate Herrick Maddox Distinguished
Lecture, McCall said he is continually
asking Oregonians "to conserve
electricity with one consequence — to
save and send those savings to
California.
"Then in turn, Californians will
bum less oil to create electricity, and
— if life is indeed fair — some of that
oil will be turned into gasoline or
diesel oil and sent to the state of
Oregon," McCall said.
Ideal Relationship
During the press conference, McCall
said such an arrangement would be
"the ideal of interstate relationships."
As part of the state's overall effort
to conserve energy', McCall "issued an
Executive Order prohibiting the use of
electricity for display lighting."
According to McCall, Interior
Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton said the
order was a "dramatic and necessary
move, whether legal or not."
McCall said "people in our state
were pleased by the ban, and they did
start to trim their thermostat settings,
and they abided by my admonition to
drive at not more than 55 m.p.h. The

public really grabbed this tiny straw
that I sailed into the wind and said,
'Okay, now we believe it. Now we'll
conserve.' "
Bottles And Cans
Mentioning Oregon's law
prohibiting non-returnable bottles and
cans, McCall asserted that "if the
nation had the same law, we could
save 68 percent of the energy saved by
lowering the national speed limit as we
are now doing."
The governor said he "could really
keep on the road. . . telling the
Oregon Story" across the country.
Responding to a question from the
audience after his speech, McCall said
"if I have to end up running for
President to keep on spreading this
message, it would be a twist of fate. I
would not welcome it, but I would
accept it."
Observers have discussed McCall as
a potential contender for the
Republican presidential nomination in
1976 and also as a possible third party
candidate for the presidency. Indeed,
McCall repeatedly referred to a "third
force" and said the two major parties
were "a little outmoded and worn."
McCall, who has had two cancer
operations in the last six months, said
he is testing his stamina by telling "the
Oregon Story" in frequent, out of
state appearances. He added that if his
