# Criticizes Lack Of Student Input
## Lyman Questions Vote's Impact 
### JOHN FREED 
President Richard Lyman last night
played down the significance of
today's student body referendum on
the Row faculty housing complex,
claiming it will be of little
consequence. However, he added
without elaboration, "It's not clear
that the project will go ahead as
planned."
(At last night's ASSU Senate
meeting, Vice President Jim Friend
said he had been told that Lyman was
asking for University reevaluation of
the issue. However, Lyman made no
mention of any such request last
night.)
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman questioned the
relevance of the issue to non-Row
residences. "Of what concern is it to a

graduate student living off campus?"
Lyman queried.
He criticized the lack of student
input through established committees
during the decision-making, but didn't
want that issue to submerge the
importance of the housing project
itself.
"I'm not sure just how to distribute
blame for the lack of communication.
The administration and staff are trying
to fill in some of the gaps. One has to
ask about the effectiveness of student
representatives on committees [that
considered the plan]," he concluded.
Lifestyles
Lyman noted that James Lyons,
dean of student affairs, had expressed
concern over a possible "clash of
lifestyles" between Row students and
emeriti faculty, during the

decision-making process.
"Almost any time you propose to
build housing close to other housing,
an uproar goes up," Lyman
commented.
Lyman said there is "no deep, dark
plot to do away with the Row," and
that much of the criticism
administrators have received lacks
perspective.
"I think it's unfair to go after
[administrators] for an error ... of
omission, then attack us for a plot to
destroy [the neighborhood!," Lyman
complained.
Lyman requested a more balanced
viewpoint from critics.
"I think it would be proper for a
sign of recognition on both sides that a
mistake has been made," Lyman
stated, hinting that students could
have better used means of input open
to them. "It would have been wiser to
get the word out to the nearby living
groups," he added.
On a different subject, the
president also talked of the "money
crunch," the topic of his recent speech
to the Academic Council. He suggested
this economic squeeze may serve, to
some extent, as a restraint on undue
optimism.
"It seemed to me the air had been
full of optimism ... I was trying to
find that elusive middle ground
between everyone getting
panicky. .. and painting a rosy
picture," he said.
"It's going to be rougher than we
hoped it would be," Lyman forecast.
The five-year Campaign for
Stanford is suffering a shortage in
endowment gifts, a situation which
Lyman says demands consideration.
"We're concerned that the
Campaign is further along in
expendable gifts than in endowment
[income]. The near collapse on Wall
Street has hurt, as. .. has inflation,"
Lyman reported.
