# Stanford Struck By Shocking Streakers
## 
### RONALD BECK 
It has risen to national attention
faster than people can take off their
clothes, and this is indeed the initial
act that sparks the sport of
"streaking."
Defined ty Newsweek as a
"Blitzkrieg run through public areas
completely in the buff," streaking is a
college phenomenon that makes panty
raids and goldfish swallowing
prehistoric.
Time says streaking is indigenous to
Southern California; however, this
bizarre pastime has also taken root on
the Stanford campus. Here, a group of
undergrads have gone on streaks
through the Quad, around Tresidder,
and through the ground floor of
UGLY — naked except for tennis
shoes.
Self-Satisfying
What prompts them? One freshman
streaker (who prefers to remain
anonymous) explains, "We don't do it
to advertise our bodies .. . We're just
having a little bit of fun shocking
people. If we had pictures of some of
the expressions we've seen, you'd
Understand why streaking is so
self-satisfying."
The number of streakers on campus
is unknown, but reactions to this form
of free expression are many and
diverse. One jaded medical school
student claims people have "struck"
since his days here as an
undergraduate. "Hell, it used to go on
all the time. Right before finals week,
you used to see one and maybe two
packs of streakers every night."
Streakers don't really know who
their fellow pranksters are across

campus, but several admit that the
majority live in fraternities and
freshman dorms. Letters recently
published in the Daily from members
of Zeta Psi fraternity charged the
Theta Delts as gross offenders. Theta
Delt President Dan Broderick asserts,
"It wasn't us. We've got to get people
to know that we have absolutely
nothing to do with it."
Initiation
Some fraternities use streaking as a
method of initiation, says Zeta Psi

member Bob Holland. "Just last week,
some frat guys took a new pledge to
the third floor of UGLY and left him
there with only a paper towel. We've
had some takeoffs on the streaking
theme in our fraternity. Last year, a
guy was in his room with a girl and six
or seven [naked] guys walked in with
golf clubs and asked if they could play
through."
Ed Snate, also of Zeta Psi, says that
even though girls should be the hardest
hit by the grotesqueness of streaking

they are, in fact, indifferent. "You
figure most of the Stanford girls don't
care because 80 percent of them are
pre-meds, and they look at it from a
biological standpoint, and the other 20
percent don't know what they're
looking at anyway."
One streaker describes female
reaction as "running from shock,
disgust, and incredibly enough, lots of
laughter.. . When that happens,
though, you might as well just pack it
up."

A Stanford girl studying in UGLY
last week called the antics of a lone
streaker "a ridiculous act by
frat-brats . . . they have to really be
sad ... getting off on pranks like
that."
The police department has not
received any complaints about
streaking. Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington says with a chuckle,
"No, we haven't had any complaints,
but a couple of years ago we had a
rash of problems with guys jamming
into a car and shining their rear ends
out the back."
Faculty members have mixed
reactions. One English professor called
the whole thing "quite silly, an
infantile stunt." Another English
professor analyzed streaking as "an
interesting phenomenon. Why would a
bunch of smart kids want to go around
exposing themselves to just anyone
who happens to be in their path?
There is certainly no rational reason."
'Pure Fun'
In an answer to that question, one
streaker replies, "We aren't particular
who we shock. Couples on dates are
sort of fun, as are old couples. The
reason we streak is because it's just
pure fun. That's a rational enough
reason for me."
No one knows where the streakers
will streak next. But one freshman
gives a hint: "We're thinking about
running across the floor at the UCLA
basketball game next month."
Another predicts the ultimate
streakers dream, disclosing a plan for
the "streak to end all streaks ... going
through a Human Sexuality lecture."

NO BUTTS ABOUT IT — Naked students enjoy shocking people as they run around campus. These fellows, posing as
streakers, put on a special show for the Daily.
It has risen to national attention
faster than people can take off their
clothes, and this is indeed the initial
act that sparks the sport of
"streaking."
Defined ty Newsweek as a
"Blitzkrieg run through public areas
completely in the buff," streaking is a
college phenomenon that makes panty
raids and goldfish swallowing
prehistoric.
Time says streaking is indigenous to
Southern California; however, this
bizarre pastime has also taken root on
the Stanford campus. Here, a group of
undergrads have gone on streaks
through the Quad, around Tresidder,
and through the ground floor of
UGLY — naked except for tennis
shoes.
Self-Satisfying
What prompts them? One freshman
streaker (who prefers to remain
anonymous) explains, "We don't do it
to advertise our bodies .. . We're just
having a little bit of fun shocking
people. If we had pictures of some of
the expressions we've seen, you'd
Understand why streaking is so
self-satisfying."
The number of streakers on campus
is unknown, but reactions to this form
of free expression are many and
diverse. One jaded medical school
student claims people have "struck"
since his days here as an
undergraduate. "Hell, it used to go on
all the time. Right before finals week,
you used to see one and maybe two
packs of streakers every night."
Streakers don't really know who
their fellow pranksters are across

campus, but several admit that the
majority live in fraternities and
freshman dorms. Letters recently
published in the Daily from members
of Zeta Psi fraternity charged the
Theta Delts as gross offenders. Theta
Delt President Dan Broderick asserts,
"It wasn't us. We've got to get people
to know that we have absolutely
nothing to do with it."
Initiation
Some fraternities use streaking as a
method of initiation, says Zeta Psi

member Bob Holland. "Just last week,
some frat guys took a new pledge to
the third floor of UGLY and left him
there with only a paper towel. We've
had some takeoffs on the streaking
theme in our fraternity. Last year, a
guy was in his room with a girl and six
or seven [naked] guys walked in with
golf clubs and asked if they could play
through."
Ed Snate, also of Zeta Psi, says that
even though girls should be the hardest
hit by the grotesqueness of streaking

they are, in fact, indifferent. "You
figure most of the Stanford girls don't
care because 80 percent of them are
pre-meds, and they look at it from a
biological standpoint, and the other 20
percent don't know what they're
looking at anyway."
One streaker describes female
reaction as "running from shock,
disgust, and incredibly enough, lots of
laughter.. . When that happens,
though, you might as well just pack it
up."

A Stanford girl studying in UGLY
last week called the antics of a lone
streaker "a ridiculous act by
frat-brats . . . they have to really be
sad ... getting off on pranks like
that."
The police department has not
received any complaints about
streaking. Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington says with a chuckle,
"No, we haven't had any complaints,
but a couple of years ago we had a
rash of problems with guys jamming
into a car and shining their rear ends
out the back."
Faculty members have mixed
reactions. One English professor called
the whole thing "quite silly, an
infantile stunt." Another English
professor analyzed streaking as "an
interesting phenomenon. Why would a
bunch of smart kids want to go around
exposing themselves to just anyone
who happens to be in their path?
There is certainly no rational reason."
'Pure Fun'
In an answer to that question, one
streaker replies, "We aren't particular
who we shock. Couples on dates are
sort of fun, as are old couples. The
reason we streak is because it's just
pure fun. That's a rational enough
reason for me."
No one knows where the streakers
will streak next. But one freshman
gives a hint: "We're thinking about
running across the floor at the UCLA
basketball game next month."
Another predicts the ultimate
streakers dream, disclosing a plan for
the "streak to end all streaks ... going
through a Human Sexuality lecture."
