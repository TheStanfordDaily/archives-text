## Faculty Housing 
### 
There are few links to the past left on this campus, and those still
extant are going fast. The University's intention to build a faculty
apartment building on the Row — until now, a preserve of gracefully
aging fraternity houses — will hardly help maintain the street's
bucolic, college-town flavor.
Architectural considerations, however, are not the only sore point
in the Row fracas. As important — perhaps more important — is the
fact that there is no record of direct consultations with Row
residents in the planning of the project, even though planning began
as early as 1964.
To Row residents, this is a matter of preserving the character of
their neighborhood. But to other campus residents, it is also a
question of whether they will be consulted in decisions about their
neighborhoods. The last question remains largely unanswered.
The sharp reaction of Row residents to the projects apparently
came as a surprise to University planners.
It was not only a protest against faculty housing; it was also a
protest against the fact that the University never formally consulted
with the residents of the Row on whether they wanted a 100-unit
apartment building in their neighborhood or not.
As Vice President Robert Augsburger put it, with characteristic
understatement, "We have not done a good job of communicating
with [Row] residents."
Obviously the University, as property-owner, has the "right" to
build a faculty apartment building anywhere it pleases; and, in the
end, it almost certainly will.
Just as obviously, the University has no "obligation" to consult
with its students on their wishes in this sort of dispute.
But with University officials singing the praise of Stanford's
"residential education" from morning to night, one would have
thought common sense — as well as common decency — would have
nudged the administration toward some prior communication with
the residents of the Row.
Sadly, this week's student referendum can do little to improve
communication. Students have never been accorded any control over
construction decisions, and when they are as ill-informed about an
issue as they are about this one, a referendum is unlikely even to
carry any advisory weight. A straw vote among Row residents —
faculty and students alike — would make much more sense.
Alternative sites for the apartment project do exist. In view of the
adverse reaction of the prospective neighbors, it would seem that
serious reconsideration is in order."
In any event, the University has yet to explain the project
satisfactorily. Unless that is done — unless the University mends its
autocratic ways ~ this simple matter of faculty apartments will leave
a bitter taste in many mouths.

The sharp reaction of Row residents to the projects apparently
came as a surprise to University planners.
It was not only a protest against faculty housing; it was also a
protest against the fact that the University never formally consulted
with the residents of the Row on whether they wanted a 100-unit
apartment building in their neighborhood or not.
As Vice President Robert Augsburger put it, with characteristic
understatement, "We have not done a good job of communicating
with [Row] residents."
Obviously the University, as property-owner, has the "right" to
build a faculty apartment building anywhere it pleases; and, in the
end, it almost certainly will.
Just as obviously, the University has no "obligation" to consult
with its students on their wishes in this sort of dispute.
But with University officials singing the praise of Stanford's
"residential education" from morning to night, one would have
thought common sense — as well as common decency — would have
nudged the administration toward some prior communication with
the residents of the Row.
Sadly, this week's student referendum can do little to improve
communication. Students have never been accorded any control over
construction decisions, and when they are as ill-informed about an
issue as they are about this one, a referendum is unlikely even to
carry any advisory weight. A straw vote among Row residents —
faculty and students alike — would make much more sense.
Alternative sites for the apartment project do exist. In view of the
adverse reaction of the prospective neighbors, it would seem that
serious reconsideration is in order."
In any event, the University has yet to explain the project
satisfactorily. Unless that is done — unless the University mends its
autocratic ways ~ this simple matter of faculty apartments will leave
a bitter taste in many mouths.
