CAB Ruling Dangerous
Editor:
Mr. Pyne's article of 31 January
prefaces a far more disturbing prospect
than bicycling to Chicago, due to
elimination of cheap transport. The
CAB's recent ruling on discriminatory
fares calls for the elimination, effective
31 December 1974, of all youth fares
from the United States. For those of
us who in the past relied on
cheap/discounted fares internationally
from the United States, the prospect
of being stranded in the United States
may become a reality. I fear that not
enough people are cognizant of this
situation.
The CAB ruling will have far greater
impact as the year progresses and
people find that the normal means of
travelling to Europe, or whatever are
no longer available.
Opportunities for
student/educational travel will be
cut back dramatically. The airlines
inability to provide equipment (due to
fuel, financial and other reasons)
means that charters will be scarcer.
The flexible and independent traveller
may soon become a thing of the past.
The full impact of the CAB's
decision which affects all members of
the International Air Transport
Association (lATA), will be
completely restrictive if it is allowed
to ensnare other discounted offerings
that commercial airlines still offer.
There are still means of travelling, and
in some cases the fares can be almost
as low as what the youth fare would
have been, and not nearly as high as
the normal economy fare. If we are
not careful the CAB will order a
cessation of the 22/45 day fares,
affinity group and other such group
discounted fares, and will effectively
render this nation immobile.
There are still ways of getting there,
and we ought to take advantage of
them . .. before the CAB can
eliminate them also.

I was jogging along on Sunday, Feb.
3, at 5 p.m., and I happened to make a

tum onto El by mistake,
since I didn't realize it was a dead end.
Before I could turn around and go
back, however, a nasty-looking
German Shepherd ran out onto the
street, barking and baring its teeth at
me.
Had I not stopped completely and
immediately, I feel rather sure that it
would have attacked me. As it was, I
could not walk without its advancing
towards me and barking. I had to wait
5-10 minutes before it moved away,
and I slowly took my leave.
As I resumed my jogging, I passed a
couple walking with their baby in a
carriage, and they told me they had
been on the street and had also turned
back because of the dog. I would
kindly request that whoever owns that
dog please secure it to a leash when it
is kept outside; a long-enough leash
will keep both the house and the
general populace secure.

I was jogging along on Sunday, Feb.
3, at 5 p.m., and I happened to make a

tum onto El by mistake,
since I didn't realize it was a dead end.
Before I could turn around and go
back, however, a nasty-looking
German Shepherd ran out onto the
street, barking and baring its teeth at
me.
Had I not stopped completely and
immediately, I feel rather sure that it
would have attacked me. As it was, I
could not walk without its advancing
towards me and barking. I had to wait
5-10 minutes before it moved away,
and I slowly took my leave.
As I resumed my jogging, I passed a
couple walking with their baby in a
carriage, and they told me they had
been on the street and had also turned
back because of the dog. I would
kindly request that whoever owns that
dog please secure it to a leash when it
is kept outside; a long-enough leash
will keep both the house and the
general populace secure.

CAB Ruling Dangerous
Editor:
Mr. Pyne's article of 31 January
prefaces a far more disturbing prospect
than bicycling to Chicago, due to
elimination of cheap transport. The
CAB's recent ruling on discriminatory
fares calls for the elimination, effective
31 December 1974, of all youth fares
from the United States. For those of
us who in the past relied on
cheap/discounted fares internationally
from the United States, the prospect
of being stranded in the United States
may become a reality. I fear that not
enough people are cognizant of this
situation.
The CAB ruling will have far greater
impact as the year progresses and
people find that the normal means of
travelling to Europe, or whatever are
no longer available.
Opportunities for
student/educational travel will be
cut back dramatically. The airlines
inability to provide equipment (due to
fuel, financial and other reasons)
means that charters will be scarcer.
The flexible and independent traveller
may soon become a thing of the past.
The full impact of the CAB's
decision which affects all members of
the International Air Transport
Association (lATA), will be
completely restrictive if it is allowed
to ensnare other discounted offerings
that commercial airlines still offer.
There are still means of travelling, and
in some cases the fares can be almost
as low as what the youth fare would
have been, and not nearly as high as
the normal economy fare. If we are
not careful the CAB will order a
cessation of the 22/45 day fares,
affinity group and other such group
discounted fares, and will effectively
render this nation immobile.
There are still ways of getting there,
