# Ex-Hooker To Speak
## Battling The Sex Laws 
### WENDY QUINONES 
If you ever walked down Haight
j Street during the height of the
Flower Power days, you might have
seen a perfectly ordinary-looking nun
gliding along nearby.
And if you followed Ken Kesey
and his Merry Pranksters through
their psychedelic antics, you might
i have known that one of their favorite
hangouts was an apartment they
dubbed "the St. James Infirmary."
But what you probably wouldn't
have known is that "St. James" and
the "nun" were one and the same:
namely, Margo St. James, hostess,
j lover of masquerade — and
prostitute.
St. James will be on campus
tonight at 8 to speak at the
Columbae House Women's Film
Series. Vivre Sa Vie, a French film
about prostitution, will also be
shown.
Symbolic Protest
Her nun's habit, a gift from a
friend, was largely for effect — she
wore it to bars and pornographic
movies — and for a private protest
against legal controls over sexuality.
But St. James doesn't wear it
much any more. Perhaps her 36 years
have mellowed her. Or perhaps the
concentration of her very
considerable energies into a single
goal — the decriminalization of
prostitution — have muted her drive
to teach by shock treatment.
In any case, her latest role as
founder and self-proclaimed
chairmadam of COYOTE, "A Loose
j Women's Organization," calls for a
bit of respectability. (COYOTE, she
says, is an acronym for Call Off Your
Old Tired Ethics. But she also says,
sounding less as though it were an
afterthought, that she chose the
name because the coyote is the most
| promiscuous mammal.)
Grant Support
Supported by fees from speaking
engagements and grants from
foundations ($5OOO from the Point
Foundation and $1000 from Playboy
were two of the first), the
Washington farmer's daughter dons
skirts and sweaters (borrowed, she
insists) or slacks and turtlenecks
(though she'd rather wear jeans and
T-shirts).
Topped by her ever-present beige
felt hat, the untiring St. James strides
through a relentless daytime round
of meetings with lawyers, city
officials, prosecutors and public
defenders. She also regularly visits
i San Francisco's jails and courts.
By night, hunched over a steaming
mug of cafe au lait, fingers twisting a

lock of shoulder-length brown hair,
she sits an Enrico's on Broadway,
watching the women work. When
they stop for a cup of coffee and a
rest, she talks.
An unabashed ex-hooker, St.
James is not shy in her contacts with
"working women." "They look at
me, and I look at them, and we both
know who we are," she says."And
then we can talk."
COYOTE Services
Softly, for plainclothesmen are
not always easy to spot, St. James
offers COYOTE's services. The
prostitute can receive free legal aid
from volunteer lawyers and law
students. If she is brutalized by
customers, police or pimps,
COYOTE can recommend a doctor.
If she is too poor to own good
clothes for her court appearances,
COYOTE has a wardrobe she can
borrow from. And if she needs
money, COYOTE can help with that,
too.
But sometimes the prostitutes are
afraid to be seen talking with St.
James. Policemen know who she is,
and any woman seen with her risks
her highly-valued anonymity. So St.
James, who understands this fear
from first-hand experience, simply
holds out a brown and beige
COYOTE card, to be used when the
need arises, as it almost always does.
Her own arrest more than 10
years ago was before she started
hooking, St. James says. But she

admits, "People gave me money
sometimes, but I never asked for it."
Arrested for soliciting a rookie
plainclothesman who invited himself
to her North Beach apartment, St.
James is still indignant over her
conviction.
Technical Conviction
"The judge convicted me because
I knew what the word 'trick' meant,"
she says, shaking her head
disgustedly. "This was in 1961, when
'trick' was being used in Broadway
plays, and this judge says that any
woman who knows what the word
means has to be a prostitute."
A year and a half later, the
conviction was overturned for lack of
evidence. But in the meantime,
prevented by her arrest record from
going back to her job as a cocktail
waitress, St. James decided to accept
the label.
"By then, I figured that if
everybody wanted to believe I was a
whore, I might as well be one," she
explains. Then she adds, "But I never
really did that much hooking,
because I was never in it for the
money. I just wanted to pay my rent
and feed my friends."
Still accepting the label, though
her active days in the oldest
profession are long over, St. James
uses it as a credential in her
COYOTE work. She believes it gives
her credibility and visibility — and
license. "I can say anything —
almost," she grins. "And I do, I do."

means has to be a prostitute."
A year and a half later, the
conviction was overturned for lack of
evidence. But in the meantime,
prevented by her arrest record from
going back to her job as a cocktail
waitress, St. James decided to accept
the label.
"By then, I figured that if
everybody wanted to believe I was a
whore, I might as well be one," she
explains. Then she adds, "But I never
really did that much hooking,
because I was never in it for the
money. I just wanted to pay my rent
and feed my friends."
Still accepting the label, though
her active days in the oldest
profession are long over, St. James
uses it as a credential in her
COYOTE work. She believes it gives
her credibility and visibility — and
license. "I can say anything —
almost," she grins. "And I do, I do."

UNABASHED — Margo St. James, a self-described ex-hooker, has dedicated
her energies to reforming laws concerning sexual behavior. She is the
founder of COYOTE, an organization seeking to provide aid to prostitutes.
If you ever walked down Haight
j Street during the height of the
Flower Power days, you might have
seen a perfectly ordinary-looking nun
gliding along nearby.
And if you followed Ken Kesey
and his Merry Pranksters through
their psychedelic antics, you might
i have known that one of their favorite
hangouts was an apartment they
dubbed "the St. James Infirmary."
But what you probably wouldn't
have known is that "St. James" and
the "nun" were one and the same:
namely, Margo St. James, hostess,
j lover of masquerade — and
prostitute.
St. James will be on campus
tonight at 8 to speak at the
Columbae House Women's Film
Series. Vivre Sa Vie, a French film
about prostitution, will also be
shown.
Symbolic Protest
Her nun's habit, a gift from a
friend, was largely for effect — she
wore it to bars and pornographic
movies — and for a private protest
against legal controls over sexuality.
But St. James doesn't wear it
much any more. Perhaps her 36 years
have mellowed her. Or perhaps the
concentration of her very
considerable energies into a single
goal — the decriminalization of
prostitution — have muted her drive
to teach by shock treatment.
In any case, her latest role as
founder and self-proclaimed
chairmadam of COYOTE, "A Loose
j Women's Organization," calls for a
bit of respectability. (COYOTE, she
says, is an acronym for Call Off Your
Old Tired Ethics. But she also says,
sounding less as though it were an
afterthought, that she chose the
name because the coyote is the most
| promiscuous mammal.)
Grant Support
Supported by fees from speaking
engagements and grants from
foundations ($5OOO from the Point
Foundation and $1000 from Playboy
were two of the first), the
Washington farmer's daughter dons
skirts and sweaters (borrowed, she
insists) or slacks and turtlenecks
(though she'd rather wear jeans and
T-shirts).
Topped by her ever-present beige
felt hat, the untiring St. James strides
through a relentless daytime round
of meetings with lawyers, city
officials, prosecutors and public
defenders. She also regularly visits
i San Francisco's jails and courts.
By night, hunched over a steaming
mug of cafe au lait, fingers twisting a

lock of shoulder-length brown hair,
she sits an Enrico's on Broadway,
watching the women work. When
they stop for a cup of coffee and a
rest, she talks.
An unabashed ex-hooker, St.
James is not shy in her contacts with
"working women." "They look at
me, and I look at them, and we both
know who we are," she says."And
then we can talk."
COYOTE Services
Softly, for plainclothesmen are
not always easy to spot, St. James
offers COYOTE's services. The
prostitute can receive free legal aid
from volunteer lawyers and law
students. If she is brutalized by
customers, police or pimps,
COYOTE can recommend a doctor.
If she is too poor to own good
clothes for her court appearances,
COYOTE has a wardrobe she can
borrow from. And if she needs
money, COYOTE can help with that,
too.
But sometimes the prostitutes are
afraid to be seen talking with St.
James. Policemen know who she is,
and any woman seen with her risks
her highly-valued anonymity. So St.
James, who understands this fear
from first-hand experience, simply
holds out a brown and beige
COYOTE card, to be used when the
need arises, as it almost always does.
Her own arrest more than 10
years ago was before she started
hooking, St. James says. But she

admits, "People gave me money
sometimes, but I never asked for it."
Arrested for soliciting a rookie
plainclothesman who invited himself
to her North Beach apartment, St.
James is still indignant over her
conviction.
Technical Conviction
"The judge convicted me because
I knew what the word 'trick' meant,"
she says, shaking her head
disgustedly. "This was in 1961, when
'trick' was being used in Broadway
plays, and this judge says that any
woman who knows what the word
means has to be a prostitute."
A year and a half later, the

borrow from. And if she needs
money, COYOTE can help with that,
too.
But sometimes the prostitutes are
afraid to be seen talking with St.
James. Policemen know who she is,
and any woman seen with her risks
her highly-valued anonymity. So St.
James, who understands this fear
from first-hand experience, simply
holds out a brown and beige
COYOTE card, to be used when the
need arises, as it almost always does.
Her own arrest more than 10
years ago was before she started
hooking, St. James says. But she

admits, "People gave me money
sometimes, but I never asked for it."
Arrested for soliciting a rookie
plainclothesman who invited himself
to her North Beach apartment, St.
James is still indignant over her
conviction.
Technical Conviction
"The judge convicted me because
I knew what the word 'trick' meant,"
she says, shaking her head
disgustedly. "This was in 1961, when
'trick' was being used in Broadway
plays, and this judge says that any
woman who knows what the word
means has to be a prostitute."
A year and a half later, the
conviction was overturned for lack of
evidence. But in the meantime,
prevented by her arrest record from
going back to her job as a cocktail
waitress, St. James decided to accept
the label.
"By then, I figured that if
everybody wanted to believe I was a
whore, I might as well be one," she
explains. Then she adds, "But I never
really did that much hooking,
because I was never in it for the
money. I just wanted to pay my rent
and feed my friends."
Still accepting the label, though
her active days in the oldest
profession are long over, St. James
uses it as a credential in her
COYOTE work. She believes it gives
her credibility and visibility — and
license. "I can say anything —
almost," she grins. "And I do, I do."

UNABASHED — Margo St. James, a self-described ex-hooker, has dedicated
her energies to reforming laws concerning sexual behavior. She is the
founder of COYOTE, an organization seeking to provide aid to prostitutes.
If you ever walked down Haight
j Street during the height of the
Flower Power days, you might have
seen a perfectly ordinary-looking nun
gliding along nearby.
And if you followed Ken Kesey
and his Merry Pranksters through
their psychedelic antics, you might
i have known that one of their favorite
hangouts was an apartment they
dubbed "the St. James Infirmary."
But what you probably wouldn't
have known is that "St. James" and
the "nun" were one and the same:
namely, Margo St. James, hostess,
j lover of masquerade — and
prostitute.
St. James will be on campus
tonight at 8 to speak at the
Columbae House Women's Film
Series. Vivre Sa Vie, a French film
about prostitution, will also be
shown.
Symbolic Protest
Her nun's habit, a gift from a
friend, was largely for effect — she
wore it to bars and pornographic
movies — and for a private protest
against legal controls over sexuality.
But St. James doesn't wear it
much any more. Perhaps her 36 years
have mellowed her. Or perhaps the
concentration of her very
considerable energies into a single
goal — the decriminalization of
prostitution — have muted her drive
to teach by shock treatment.
In any case, her latest role as
founder and self-proclaimed
chairmadam of COYOTE, "A Loose
j Women's Organization," calls for a
bit of respectability. (COYOTE, she
says, is an acronym for Call Off Your
Old Tired Ethics. But she also says,
sounding less as though it were an
afterthought, that she chose the
name because the coyote is the most
| promiscuous mammal.)
Grant Support
Supported by fees from speaking
engagements and grants from
foundations ($5OOO from the Point
Foundation and $1000 from Playboy
were two of the first), the
Washington farmer's daughter dons
skirts and sweaters (borrowed, she
insists) or slacks and turtlenecks
(though she'd rather wear jeans and
T-shirts).
Topped by her ever-present beige
felt hat, the untiring St. James strides
through a relentless daytime round
of meetings with lawyers, city
officials, prosecutors and public
defenders. She also regularly visits
i San Francisco's jails and courts.
By night, hunched over a steaming
mug of cafe au lait, fingers twisting a

lock of shoulder-length brown hair,
she sits an Enrico's on Broadway,
watching the women work. When
they stop for a cup of coffee and a
rest, she talks.
An unabashed ex-hooker, St.
James is not shy in her contacts with
"working women." "They look at
me, and I look at them, and we both
know who we are," she says."And
then we can talk."
COYOTE Services
Softly, for plainclothesmen are
not always easy to spot, St. James
offers COYOTE's services. The
prostitute can receive free legal aid
from volunteer lawyers and law
students. If she is brutalized by
customers, police or pimps,
COYOTE can recommend a doctor.
If she is too poor to own good
clothes for her court appearances,
COYOTE has a wardrobe she can
borrow from. And if she needs
money, COYOTE can help with that,
too.
