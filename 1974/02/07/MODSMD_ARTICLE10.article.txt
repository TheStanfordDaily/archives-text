## Marxian Economics Unscientific 
### 
Bill Evers

Marxian economists often declare that their
approach to the discipline is a scientific one. To see
if this claim to scientific status is valid, we shall
examine three questions: (1) Does the Marxian
theory of value correctly explain (a) the exchange
ratios (prices) of goods and services and (b) profit
rates? (2) Is the economic calculation necessary to a
modern industrial economy possible in a
self-contained socialist system? and (3) Is the ethical
goal of equality, a goal aimed at in the policy
prescriptions of many Marxians and modern welfare
economists, compatible with the findings of
economic science?
Marx contend! that the exchange ratios of goods
are determined by the amount of labor time
embodied in the goods. He is arguing that the
relative costs of production determine the
value-in-exchange of goods. That is, relative prices
are proportional to the relative labor inputs
embodied in the production of the respective
commodities.
But the labor theory of value cannot explain the
prices of such economic goods as a Rembrandt
painting, aged wine, wild fruit, or a gem accidently
kicked up by a stroller on a beach. These immediate
and obvious failings are part of a more general
problem.
In general, we can say that the labor theory of
value is unable to explain the price relations which
exist on the market.
Supply And Demand
In contrast, if we examine the logic of economic
choice, we see that in fact it is the conditions of
supply and demand which determine prices.
The primary scientific error made by Marx and
all others holding a Ricardian cost-of-production
theory of value was not recognizing that past costs
of production do not affect the final-product
pricing decisions of resource owners at all. All that
concerns the resource owner are the alternatives
that lie before him; the cost he faces is the next
most highly value use to which he could put his

resource.
A given supply of goods is produced because of
the previous choices of producers, who had weighed
on their personal value scales the money expected
to be paid by consumers against the possibilities
forgone by engaging in this production. It is in this
context that resource owners exchange with
consumers, who each have their own individual and
incommensurable (not comparable) scales of
preference.
Profit Theory
Marx's theory of profit is built upon his value
theory that goods are exchanged in proportion to
the labor embodied in them.
The flaw in Marx's profit theory was pinpointed
originally by Eugen von Boehm-Bawerk, who wrote:
"[Marx's] theory demands that capitals of equal
amount, but of dissimilar organic composition [that
is, production processes with dissimilar ratios of
labor to machinery and materials], should exhibit
different profits. The real world, however, most
plainly shows that it is governed by the law that
capitals of equal amount, without regard to possible
differences of organic composition, yield equal
profits."
Without going into great detail, one can only say
that finding a contradiction between his theory and
reality, Marx abandons his labor theory of value
here.
To test the possibility of economic calculation in
a self-contained socialist system, it is necessary to
perform a mental experiment: Imagine that there
exists a world-wide socialist state in which there is
no pricing on the market, and there are no private
titles to factors used in production. Then calculate
whether some possible project is economically
worthwhile.
Ludwig von Mises
Ludwig von Mises, who made the first full
statement of this problem of socialism, gives a
simple example that illustrates the problem:
"Today two methods are resorted to for

providing a city with clean water. Either one brings
the water over long distances in aqueducts, or one
chemically purifies the water available in the city's
neighborhood.
"Why does one not produce water synthetically
in factories? Modern technology could easily solve
the technological problems involved.. .. However,
the only reason why the synthetic production of
drinking water today — perhaps not at a later day —
is out of the question is that economic calculation
in terms of money shows that it is a more expensive
procedure than other methods,"
Mises argues that in the absence of market prices
for the factors of production, economic calculation
is not possible. Abba P. Lerner's proposed solution
of the problem raised by Mises is to set up a
quasi-market and to order the managers of all firms
in the socialist society to set prices at marginal
opportunity costs.
Cost Not Measurable
But Lerner's suggestion will not solve the
problem. Its policy rules rely on a concept of cost
as measurable by an outside observer. But cost is
not measurable; it is the forgone opportunity to use
a resource in the way the decision-maker mentally
evaluates as next best.
Lastly, we must consider whether the goal of
equality-of-satisfaction makes sense as a goal of
economic policy. All such satisfaction must be in
terms of preference rankings of individuals.
Intensities of psychological satisfaction are
incommensurable; interpersonal comparison is
impossible. As a consequence, the policy goal of
equality-of-satisfaction is for all practical purposes
meaningless.
What we know about the logic of choice and the
nature of economic activity show that in the areas
examined the claims of Marxian economics to be
scientific are invalid.
