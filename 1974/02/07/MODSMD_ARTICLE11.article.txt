# AMA Controls Number Of Doctors
## Free Market Medical Education 
###

More microphones and recording equipment at
bio lectures than at Presidential press conferences,
intense competition for grades and
recommendations: In the past few years, the
characteristics of the pre-med phenomenon at
Stanford have become painfully apparent.
Yet the real reason for all this strife and the
curious situation in America today of thousands
upon thousands of qualified people who wish to
enter the medical profession and at the same time a
shortage of doctors is rarely examined or discussed,
especially by these pre-meds. Yet in few other areas
are the conservative theses of the superiority of the
free market and of the view that government
intervention works to the disadvantage of the
consumer and to the advantage of special interest
groups borne out with more clarity.
The frenzied competition for grades and the
padding of schedules with "micks" are not irrational
actions, but are based on the sad reality that there
are too many highly intelligent, highly qualified
people applying for far too few medical school
positions. The shortage of doctors and the high
number of applicants rejected is due to the shortage
in medical schools.
This condition creates another incentive to
become a doctor. When there is a large demand for
medical services and a severely limited and
controlled supply of doctors, the market decrees
high prices, and therefore assured high salaries.
Why A Shortage
Yet why is it that a country which spends such
great amounts publicly and privately in higher
education has such a shortage of opportunities for a
medical education? And why is this shortage true in
virtually no other field? In an article in the Journal
of Law and Economics in April 1972, Prof. Reuben
Kessel notes that medical study is "the only major
field in which more Americans study abroad than
foreigners study in the United States."
The reason for the limited opportunity of
medical studies and the guaranteed high doctor
incomes is due to the strict control of who becomes
a doctor by the American Medical Association. In
an earlier article in the same journal, Kessel notes

that medicine, prior to the founding of the AMA in
1847, was a relatively competitive industry. Medical
schools were easy to start and provided a varied
choice of medical training from the very good to the
very poor.
The AMA from the start "committed itself to
two propositions that were to lead to sharp
restrictions on the freedom of would-be doctors to
enter the medical profession." Medical students
should acquire a suitable preliminary education and
"a uniform elevated standard of requirements for
the degree of MD should be adopted by all medical
schools," the AMA declared.
Licensure and Control
Licensure of doctors was the first step in making
these requirements mandatory. Yet the real control
was not achieved until the AMA began accrediting
schools of medicine.
In 1910, a report on the AMA's inspection and
grading of medical schools was published by the
Carnegie Foundation, under the supervision of
Abraham Flexner. The Flexner report convinced
state legislators that only the graduates of first class
medical schools ought to be permitted to practice
medicine and led to the delegation to the AMA of
the responsibility of determining what was a first
class medical school.
As a result of this trend, standards of
acceptability for winning a license to practice
medicine are set by the formal rule or informal
policy of state medical examining boards. These
rules provide that the boards consider only
graduates of schools approved by the AMA.
Fewer Medical Schools
Through the use of this certification power, the
AMA reduced the number of medical schools in the
United States from 162 in 1906 to 85 in 1920, 76
in 1930, and 69 in 1944. In 1958, the year of the
earlier Kessel study, the number of medical students
in school in the U.S. was 28,500, only 5,200 more
than in 1910. While the number has greatly
increased in recent years, it is no where near
enough.
This control of certification by the AMA
together with the limitation that only graduates of

medical schools certified by the AMA be able to
take the medical examining boards has not only
limited the number of medical students but
increased the cost of medical education. If the AMA
requirement were lifted and all applicants could
take the examining boards, then there would be
greater competition in the production of medical
students and a pressure to decrease the costs of
producing doctors.
Before the AMA accreditation killed them,
non-accredited medical schools were producing
graduates who could pass medical examining boards.
There is no reason to believe that they could not
still do so today.
Oversupply?
The AMA standards would be more defensible if
they had been based solely on the desire to improve
medical quality. Yet a great deal of their motivation
was to reduce a supposed "oversupply of doctors."
In his report, Flexner cited with approval attacks on
the greed of medical school owners and faculty for
student tuitions and the desires of the public for
producing unwanted physicians.
In the introduction to the Flexner report, the
argument is made that the number of physicians
should be controlled to a strict ratio such that
physicians will be provided with a "competent
livelihood," a problem which can be said, in
retrospect, to be pretty well solved.
What the government together with the AMA
have done with the medicine market would be
comparable in the automobile market to a ban on
all cars except Lincolns and Cadillacs. Like these
luxury cars, today's doctors are of generally high
quality, expensively produced, limited in number,
and catered to the more well-to-do. Yet, as Kessel
notes, there is a great deal of room in both markets
for Ford and VW quality.
A more free market type of medical education
would not eliminate the high costs of all medical
care, which are to a great extent caused by
expensive research and equipment, but would be a
major step in that direction and in increasing the
availability of medical care.

Through the use of this certification power, the
AMA reduced the number of medical schools in the
United States from 162 in 1906 to 85 in 1920, 76
in 1930, and 69 in 1944. In 1958, the year of the
earlier Kessel study, the number of medical students
in school in the U.S. was 28,500, only 5,200 more
than in 1910. While the number has greatly
increased in recent years, it is no where near
enough.
This control of certification by the AMA
together with the limitation that only graduates of

medical schools certified by the AMA be able to
take the medical examining boards has not only
limited the number of medical students but
increased the cost of medical education. If the AMA
requirement were lifted and all applicants could
take the examining boards, then there would be
greater competition in the production of medical
students and a pressure to decrease the costs of
producing doctors.
Before the AMA accreditation killed them,
non-accredited medical schools were producing
graduates who could pass medical examining boards.
There is no reason to believe that they could not
still do so today.
Oversupply?
The AMA standards would be more defensible if
they had been based solely on the desire to improve
medical quality. Yet a great deal of their motivation
was to reduce a supposed "oversupply of doctors."
In his report, Flexner cited with approval attacks on
the greed of medical school owners and faculty for
student tuitions and the desires of the public for
producing unwanted physicians.
In the introduction to the Flexner report, the
argument is made that the number of physicians
should be controlled to a strict ratio such that
physicians will be provided with a "competent
livelihood," a problem which can be said, in
retrospect, to be pretty well solved.
What the government together with the AMA
have done with the medicine market would be
comparable in the automobile market to a ban on
all cars except Lincolns and Cadillacs. Like these
luxury cars, today's doctors are of generally high
quality, expensively produced, limited in number,
and catered to the more well-to-do. Yet, as Kessel
notes, there is a great deal of room in both markets
for Ford and VW quality.
A more free market type of medical education
would not eliminate the high costs of all medical
care, which are to a great extent caused by
expensive research and equipment, but would be a
major step in that direction and in increasing the
availability of medical care.

More microphones and recording equipment at
bio lectures than at Presidential press conferences,
intense competition for grades and
recommendations: In the past few years, the
characteristics of the pre-med phenomenon at
Stanford have become painfully apparent.
Yet the real reason for all this strife and the
curious situation in America today of thousands
upon thousands of qualified people who wish to
enter the medical profession and at the same time a
shortage of doctors is rarely examined or discussed,
especially by these pre-meds. Yet in few other areas
are the conservative theses of the superiority of the
free market and of the view that government
intervention works to the disadvantage of the
consumer and to the advantage of special interest
groups borne out with more clarity.
The frenzied competition for grades and the
padding of schedules with "micks" are not irrational
actions, but are based on the sad reality that there
are too many highly intelligent, highly qualified
people applying for far too few medical school
positions. The shortage of doctors and the high
number of applicants rejected is due to the shortage
in medical schools.
This condition creates another incentive to
become a doctor. When there is a large demand for
medical services and a severely limited and
controlled supply of doctors, the market decrees
high prices, and therefore assured high salaries.
Why A Shortage
Yet why is it that a country which spends such
great amounts publicly and privately in higher
education has such a shortage of opportunities for a
medical education? And why is this shortage true in
virtually no other field? In an article in the Journal
of Law and Economics in April 1972, Prof. Reuben
Kessel notes that medical study is "the only major
field in which more Americans study abroad than
foreigners study in the United States."
The reason for the limited opportunity of
medical studies and the guaranteed high doctor
incomes is due to the strict control of who becomes
a doctor by the American Medical Association. In
an earlier article in the same journal, Kessel notes

that medicine, prior to the founding of the AMA in
1847, was a relatively competitive industry. Medical
schools were easy to start and provided a varied
choice of medical training from the very good to the
very poor.
The AMA from the start "committed itself to
two propositions that were to lead to sharp
restrictions on the freedom of would-be doctors to
enter the medical profession." Medical students
should acquire a suitable preliminary education and
"a uniform elevated standard of requirements for
the degree of MD should be adopted by all medical
schools," the AMA declared.
Licensure and Control
Licensure of doctors was the first step in making
these requirements mandatory. Yet the real control
was not achieved until the AMA began accrediting
schools of medicine.
In 1910, a report on the AMA's inspection and
grading of medical schools was published by the
Carnegie Foundation, under the supervision of
Abraham Flexner. The Flexner report convinced
state legislators that only the graduates of first class
medical schools ought to be permitted to practice
medicine and led to the delegation to the AMA of
the responsibility of determining what was a first
class medical school.
As a result of this trend, standards of
acceptability for winning a license to practice
medicine are set by the formal rule or informal
policy of state medical examining boards. These
rules provide that the boards consider only
graduates of schools approved by the AMA.
Fewer Medical Schools
Through the use of this certification power, the
AMA reduced the number of medical schools in the
United States from 162 in 1906 to 85 in 1920, 76

groups borne out with more clarity.
The frenzied competition for grades and the
padding of schedules with "micks" are not irrational
actions, but are based on the sad reality that there
are too many highly intelligent, highly qualified
people applying for far too few medical school
positions. The shortage of doctors and the high
number of applicants rejected is due to the shortage
in medical schools.
This condition creates another incentive to
become a doctor. When there is a large demand for
medical services and a severely limited and
controlled supply of doctors, the market decrees
high prices, and therefore assured high salaries.
Why A Shortage
Yet why is it that a country which spends such
great amounts publicly and privately in higher
education has such a shortage of opportunities for a
medical education? And why is this shortage true in
virtually no other field? In an article in the Journal
of Law and Economics in April 1972, Prof. Reuben
Kessel notes that medical study is "the only major
field in which more Americans study abroad than
foreigners study in the United States."
The reason for the limited opportunity of
medical studies and the guaranteed high doctor
incomes is due to the strict control of who becomes
a doctor by the American Medical Association. In
an earlier article in the same journal, Kessel notes

that medicine, prior to the founding of the AMA in
1847, was a relatively competitive industry. Medical
schools were easy to start and provided a varied
choice of medical training from the very good to the
very poor.
The AMA from the start "committed itself to
two propositions that were to lead to sharp
restrictions on the freedom of would-be doctors to
enter the medical profession." Medical students
should acquire a suitable preliminary education and
"a uniform elevated standard of requirements for
the degree of MD should be adopted by all medical
schools," the AMA declared.
Licensure and Control
Licensure of doctors was the first step in making
these requirements mandatory. Yet the real control
was not achieved until the AMA began accrediting
schools of medicine.
In 1910, a report on the AMA's inspection and
grading of medical schools was published by the
Carnegie Foundation, under the supervision of
Abraham Flexner. The Flexner report convinced
state legislators that only the graduates of first class
medical schools ought to be permitted to practice
medicine and led to the delegation to the AMA of
the responsibility of determining what was a first
class medical school.
As a result of this trend, standards of
acceptability for winning a license to practice
medicine are set by the formal rule or informal
policy of state medical examining boards. These
rules provide that the boards consider only
graduates of schools approved by the AMA.
Fewer Medical Schools
Through the use of this certification power, the
AMA reduced the number of medical schools in the
United States from 162 in 1906 to 85 in 1920, 76
in 1930, and 69 in 1944. In 1958, the year of the
earlier Kessel study, the number of medical students
in school in the U.S. was 28,500, only 5,200 more
than in 1910. While the number has greatly
increased in recent years, it is no where near
enough.
This control of certification by the AMA
together with the limitation that only graduates of

medical schools certified by the AMA be able to
take the medical examining boards has not only
limited the number of medical students but
increased the cost of medical education. If the AMA
requirement were lifted and all applicants could
take the examining boards, then there would be
greater competition in the production of medical
students and a pressure to decrease the costs of
producing doctors.
Before the AMA accreditation killed them,
non-accredited medical schools were producing
graduates who could pass medical examining boards.
There is no reason to believe that they could not
still do so today.
Oversupply?
The AMA standards would be more defensible if
they had been based solely on the desire to improve
medical quality. Yet a great deal of their motivation
was to reduce a supposed "oversupply of doctors."
In his report, Flexner cited with approval attacks on
the greed of medical school owners and faculty for
student tuitions and the desires of the public for
producing unwanted physicians.
In the introduction to the Flexner report, the
argument is made that the number of physicians
should be controlled to a strict ratio such that
physicians will be provided with a "competent
livelihood," a problem which can be said, in
retrospect, to be pretty well solved.
What the government together with the AMA
have done with the medicine market would be
comparable in the automobile market to a ban on
all cars except Lincolns and Cadillacs. Like these
luxury cars, today's doctors are of generally high
quality, expensively produced, limited in number,
and catered to the more well-to-do. Yet, as Kessel
notes, there is a great deal of room in both markets
for Ford and VW quality.
A more free market type of medical education
would not eliminate the high costs of all medical
care, which are to a great extent caused by
expensive research and equipment, but would be a
major step in that direction and in increasing the
availability of medical care.

More microphones and recording equipment at

Yet the real reason for all this strife and the
