# Oil Firms Cut Back Credit
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Some oil
companies are cutting back on
credit extended to motorists
because the companies don't need
the business anymore.
These days of gasoline
shortages and long lines at the
service station have also brought
high profits to the oil companies.
And the high profits and
assured sales of all the gasoline
they can produce have prompted
some companies to stop
promoting their own credit cards
or to tighten up on credit
requirements.
Other firms have stopped
credit arrangements with other oil
companies, or with banks and
corporations which offer
all-purpose travel cards.
Not all oil companies are
taking this route. Some of the
largest oil firms say there's been

no change in their credit practices.
"We just don't need to go after
the costly customer with credit,"
said Bob Jenkins, head of
marketing services for the
Continental Oil Co., which retails
gasoline under the Conoco sign.
"The need for expanding credit
business no longer exists."
Jenkins said Continental had
"substantially slowed down its
credit card activity" because of
gasoline supply restrictions and
government regulations which
prevent a "pass-through" to
customers in the cost of doing
business.
Mobil Oil, the nation's second
largest oil producer, is still
accepting new accounts, but is
tightening the criteria, said a
spokesman. "We only want the
really good accounts," he said.
Gulf Oil, which has never

developed a broad credit program,
is "going to look at the cards a
little bit harder than before," a
spokesman said.
In contrast a spokesman for
Exxon Corp., the nation's biggest
oil firm, said there had been no
change in policy.
"We're not discouraging the
use of credit cards," the Exxon
official said. "Other cards are still
acceptable."
