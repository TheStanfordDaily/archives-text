# 'We Saw Bob Dylan'
## 
### RANDY BAKER 
If you are wondering what to expect of Bob
Dylan and The Band in their Feb. 11 concert at
the Oakland Coliseum, read on. On Jan. 3 and 4
in Chicago, I saw the first two shows of this
much-ballyhooed tour. What follows is a brief
play-by-play:
Dylan and The Band came unannounced onto
the stage, which was adorned with many of the
comforts of home. A plump old sofa, bunk beds,
candles, and a Tiffany lamp sat mysteriously at
the peripheries of the stage. Dylan, clad in jeans
and a black sweater, opened with an obscure
early song called "Hero Blues," then launched
into "Lay Lady Lay."
The Multi-Faceted Dylan
For those who had wondered which Dylan we
would see (for there have been many:
folksinging, electric, countrified, laid back), it
soon became apparent that we would see all of
them, to a degree. Dylan performed songs
covering the entire spectrum from his first
album to his latest.
As the first set continued, Dylan sang, among
others, "It Ain't Me Babe," "Ballad of a Thin
Man," "All Along the Watchtower," and
"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" while The Band
soloed on numbers such as "The Night They
Drove Old Dixie Down," "Stage Fright," "King
Harvest," and "Up on Cripple Creek." As the
first set ended, Dylan spoke his only words of
the night, "Back in 15 minutes" (the next night
he added, "Don't go away").
Solo Acoustic Set
The opening segment of the concert's second
half was the most memorable part of the show.
Dylan, now in a white shirt, came onstage alone
to perform five songs on acoustic guitar. On
opening night he did "The Times They Are
A-Changin'," "Song to Woody," "The Lonesome
Death of Hattie Carroll," a new song possibly
entitled "Except You," and "It's Alright Ma (I'm
Only Bleeding)." The following night he
substituted "Love Minus Zero/No Limit" for

"Woody."
After the acoustic set, The Band did a short
set which included "The Shape I'm In," "Rag
Mama Rag," "When You Awake," and"The
Weight." Then Dylan joined them to sing two
new songs and the closer, "Like A Rolling
Stone." After an enthusiastic ovation that went
on for minutes, Dylan and The Band came back
for an encore. On opening night it was "Most
Likely You Go Your Way (and I'll Go Mine)."
The next night it was "Maggie's Farm."
It is difficult to predict exactly what course
the Dylan show in Oakland will take. The
Chicago dates, in a manner, were merely
rehearsals for the rest of the tour. The playing
was often very loose, but usually exceptional.
The shows were not planned at all; Dylan and
The Band huddled after every song to work out
what to play next. As the lyrics of each song
ended and it became an instrumental jam,
everyone would face towards each other to try
to work out an ending. Things should be quite
different by the time Oakland is reached.
If there was one general criticism of the
Chicago concerts, it was that Dylan was too
businesslike. Rather than playing to the audience
he seemed to ignore it and, as a result, failed to
really reach the audience as some felt only he
could. The acoustic segment, where Bob Dylan
was most exposed, where Bob Dylan couldn't
ignore the crowd, was considered to be the
highlight of each show.
Dylan Myth
Unfortunately, the Dylan myth has grown to
such large proportions that some people are
bound to be disappointed when they discover
that Bob Dylan is only a man rather than God.
He's undertaken a large responsibility in trying
to live up to his legend, but I think that almost
everyone who saw him in Chicago was quite
happy, if not ecstatic, over his performance.
After all, we saw Bob Dylan.
And he was great.

folksinging, electric, countrified, laid back), it
soon became apparent that we would see all of
them, to a degree. Dylan performed songs
covering the entire spectrum from his first
album to his latest.
As the first set continued, Dylan sang, among
others, "It Ain't Me Babe," "Ballad of a Thin
Man," "All Along the Watchtower," and
"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" while The Band
soloed on numbers such as "The Night They
Drove Old Dixie Down," "Stage Fright," "King
Harvest," and "Up on Cripple Creek." As the
first set ended, Dylan spoke his only words of
the night, "Back in 15 minutes" (the next night
he added, "Don't go away").
Solo Acoustic Set
The opening segment of the concert's second
half was the most memorable part of the show.
Dylan, now in a white shirt, came onstage alone
to perform five songs on acoustic guitar. On
opening night he did "The Times They Are
A-Changin'," "Song to Woody," "The Lonesome
Death of Hattie Carroll," a new song possibly
entitled "Except You," and "It's Alright Ma (I'm
Only Bleeding)." The following night he
substituted "Love Minus Zero/No Limit" for

"Woody."
After the acoustic set, The Band did a short
set which included "The Shape I'm In," "Rag
Mama Rag," "When You Awake," and"The
Weight." Then Dylan joined them to sing two
new songs and the closer, "Like A Rolling
Stone." After an enthusiastic ovation that went
on for minutes, Dylan and The Band came back
for an encore. On opening night it was "Most
Likely You Go Your Way (and I'll Go Mine)."
The next night it was "Maggie's Farm."
It is difficult to predict exactly what course
the Dylan show in Oakland will take. The
Chicago dates, in a manner, were merely
rehearsals for the rest of the tour. The playing
was often very loose, but usually exceptional.
The shows were not planned at all; Dylan and
The Band huddled after every song to work out
what to play next. As the lyrics of each song
ended and it became an instrumental jam,
everyone would face towards each other to try
to work out an ending. Things should be quite
different by the time Oakland is reached.
If there was one general criticism of the
Chicago concerts, it was that Dylan was too
businesslike. Rather than playing to the audience
he seemed to ignore it and, as a result, failed to
really reach the audience as some felt only he
could. The acoustic segment, where Bob Dylan
was most exposed, where Bob Dylan couldn't
ignore the crowd, was considered to be the
highlight of each show.
Dylan Myth
Unfortunately, the Dylan myth has grown to
such large proportions that some people are
bound to be disappointed when they discover
that Bob Dylan is only a man rather than God.
He's undertaken a large responsibility in trying
to live up to his legend, but I think that almost
everyone who saw him in Chicago was quite
happy, if not ecstatic, over his performance.
After all, we saw Bob Dylan.
And he was great.
If you are wondering what to expect of Bob
Dylan and The Band in their Feb. 11 concert at
the Oakland Coliseum, read on. On Jan. 3 and 4
in Chicago, I saw the first two shows of this
much-ballyhooed tour. What follows is a brief
play-by-play:
Dylan and The Band came unannounced onto
the stage, which was adorned with many of the
comforts of home. A plump old sofa, bunk beds,
candles, and a Tiffany lamp sat mysteriously at
the peripheries of the stage. Dylan, clad in jeans
and a black sweater, opened with an obscure
early song called "Hero Blues," then launched
into "Lay Lady Lay."
The Multi-Faceted Dylan
For those who had wondered which Dylan we
would see (for there have been many:
folksinging, electric, countrified, laid back), it
soon became apparent that we would see all of
them, to a degree. Dylan performed songs
covering the entire spectrum from his first
album to his latest.
