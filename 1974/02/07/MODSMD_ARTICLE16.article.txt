# S.F. Ballet Offers Comedy
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
SAN FRANCISCO - "A
dancer's body is the celebrant of
life," Martha Graham once
observed. Last Saturday night at
the Opera House, the San
Francisco Ballet offered a
program of works that mirrored
life's comic irony and intense
tragedy with insightful
choreography, near-flawless
technique, and vibrant dance
interpretation.
The program began with Con
A more, a ballet in the opera buffa
tradition, choreographed by
company artistic director Lew
Christiansen to music by Rossini.
The audience obviously
enjoyed the comic surprises in
Con Amore's scenario as much as
the performers enjoyed dancing it.
Camp of the Amazons
The action begins in the camp
of the Amazons, a corps of
musket-brandishing lady warriors
who resemble Revolutionary War
soldiers in long tutus. Their
precision drill-dancing is
interrupted by the intrusion of an
exhuberant thief. The Amazons
capture him at sword point, and
decide to punish the trespassor by
forcing him to partner their
captain.
Just as the thief bares his chest
in deference to his captors, the
audience is whisked into the
boudoir of a fickle wife who is
saying goodbye to her husband
and preparing to entertain a trio
of lovers.
Her husband's return abruptly
halts her misadventures. While the
trapped lovers are quaking, the
wayward wife receives a good
shaking.
Meanwhile, back at the

Amazon camp, the thief discovers
at musket-point that the advances
of the lady warriors are offers he
dare not refuse.
The thief gets the shady lady,
her husband captures the Amazon
captain, and at the final curtain,
everyone is satisfied, including the
audience.
Breathtaking Intensity
After such unrestrained
hilarity, the intense drama of The
Beloved struck the audience with
all the subtlety of a slap in the
face.
The Beloved is choreographer
Lester Horton's impression of the
love-hate relationship of a
turn-of-the-century married
couple.
At the outset, they sit stiffly in
high-back chairs, he chastising her
for unfaithfulness, by reading a
passage from Scripture. Then, to
discordant, demanding,
almost-demented piano
accompaniment, she gropes for his
hand in repentance. They rise. In
the ensuing struggle, she begs his
forgiveness. He shoves her away.
They lock in embrace and in
combat, their hands never really
touching. Finally, she sits in his
chair, he in hers. It is too much
for him, and he strangles her.
Not one movement in The
Beloved is without meaning. A
still photograph taken at any
instant in the brief work would be
a graphic, expressive portrait of
poignant tragedy. But the
inspired, interpretative dancing of
Paula Tracy and Vane Vest
exhaust's this reviewer's
vocabulary of superlatives.
The two remaining ballets on
the program floundered without

purpose.
Choreographer George
Balanchine based The Four
Temperments on the ancient
notion that the human organism is
made up of four humors, or
temperments. Although the
choreography was both interesting
and creative, the temperments
were vague enough to be
indistinguishable from one other.
The evening's final work,
Christiansen's Jest of Cards should
have been declared a misdeal.
McFall returned to the stage as a
joker who shuffles the other cards
in the deck, and finally deals out
death. But sloppy staging marred
what choreograhpical interest the
ballet did contain.
The Opera House was about
two-thirds full Saturday night.
But the San Francisco Ballet
dancers provide such fine
entertainment that it is difficult
to understand why the house
wasn't packed.

high-back chairs, he chastising her
for unfaithfulness, by reading a
passage from Scripture. Then, to
discordant, demanding,
almost-demented piano
accompaniment, she gropes for his
hand in repentance. They rise. In
the ensuing struggle, she begs his
forgiveness. He shoves her away.
They lock in embrace and in
combat, their hands never really
touching. Finally, she sits in his
chair, he in hers. It is too much
for him, and he strangles her.
Not one movement in The
Beloved is without meaning. A
still photograph taken at any
instant in the brief work would be
a graphic, expressive portrait of
poignant tragedy. But the
inspired, interpretative dancing of
Paula Tracy and Vane Vest
exhaust's this reviewer's
vocabulary of superlatives.
The two remaining ballets on
the program floundered without

purpose.
Choreographer George
Balanchine based The Four
Temperments on the ancient
notion that the human organism is
made up of four humors, or
temperments. Although the
choreography was both interesting
and creative, the temperments
were vague enough to be
indistinguishable from one other.
The evening's final work,
Christiansen's Jest of Cards should
have been declared a misdeal.
McFall returned to the stage as a
joker who shuffles the other cards
in the deck, and finally deals out
death. But sloppy staging marred
what choreograhpical interest the
ballet did contain.
The Opera House was about
two-thirds full Saturday night.
But the San Francisco Ballet
dancers provide such fine
entertainment that it is difficult
to understand why the house
wasn't packed.
SAN FRANCISCO - "A
dancer's body is the celebrant of
life," Martha Graham once
observed. Last Saturday night at
the Opera House, the San
Francisco Ballet offered a
program of works that mirrored
life's comic irony and intense
tragedy with insightful
choreography, near-flawless
technique, and vibrant dance
interpretation.
The program began with Con
A more, a ballet in the opera buffa
tradition, choreographed by
company artistic director Lew
Christiansen to music by Rossini.
The audience obviously
enjoyed the comic surprises in
Con Amore's scenario as much as
the performers enjoyed dancing it.
Camp of the Amazons
The action begins in the camp
of the Amazons, a corps of
musket-brandishing lady warriors
who resemble Revolutionary War
soldiers in long tutus. Their
precision drill-dancing is
interrupted by the intrusion of an
exhuberant thief. The Amazons
capture him at sword point, and
decide to punish the trespassor by
forcing him to partner their
captain.
Just as the thief bares his chest
in deference to his captors, the
audience is whisked into the
boudoir of a fickle wife who is
saying goodbye to her husband
and preparing to entertain a trio
of lovers.
Her husband's return abruptly
halts her misadventures. While the
trapped lovers are quaking, the
wayward wife receives a good
shaking.
Meanwhile, back at the

Amazon camp, the thief discovers
at musket-point that the advances
of the lady warriors are offers he
dare not refuse.
The thief gets the shady lady,
her husband captures the Amazon
captain, and at the final curtain,
everyone is satisfied, including the
audience.
Breathtaking Intensity
After such unrestrained
hilarity, the intense drama of The
Beloved struck the audience with
all the subtlety of a slap in the
face.
The Beloved is choreographer
Lester Horton's impression of the
love-hate relationship of a
turn-of-the-century married
couple.
At the outset, they sit stiffly in
high-back chairs, he chastising her
for unfaithfulness, by reading a
passage from Scripture. Then, to
discordant, demanding,
almost-demented piano
accompaniment, she gropes for his
hand in repentance. They rise. In
