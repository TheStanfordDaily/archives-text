# Folklorico Puts On Varied, Fun Show
## 
### CHRIS SHERRY 
Ballet Folklorico of Mexico does not put on an especially
illuminating performance. Their program is not exactly inspiring, nor
artistically original But Amalia Hernandez's company of seventy does
present an extremely varied, colorful, and entertaining evening of song
and dance that is thoroughly enjoyable and surprisngly refreshing.
Friday night's program at the San Francisco Masonic Auditorium
opened on a rather inauspicious note with Los Concheros, (The Dance
of the Shells) a homage to the gods of the compass. The straight-faced
dancers, clad in bright robes with enormous gold headresses,
performed series of accelerating hops and skips in diagonal patterns
that soon became repetitious.
The Indo-Spanish sones of
Michoacan were easily the most entertaining sequence of the first act.
Both charming and technically impressive, they consisted of jotas,
sarabandes and a series of jarobes done as solos.
Unfortunately, The Revolution, the only work done on a
contemporary theme, was something of a disappointment.
The group choreography seemed
awkward and monotonous and the scenes with the insurgents came
across as embarrasingly corny.
By intermission the incredible color and exuberance of the folk
dances had become wearing, and the more subdued Indian based
dances of the second act proved to be a welcome change.
By far the most remarkable dance of the evening was the Dance of
the Deer, the world famous folklore ritual of the Yaquis of Sonora.
Emilio Caron as the deer was outstanding in his tense body rolls and
quick head movements, and the two hunters were strong, energetic,
and clean. The piece is short and haunting, done in near silence, with
only occasional drumming and bells.
The company pulled out all the stops in the exhilirating
Guadalajara. Complete with paseos, heel dances, charros, a mariachi
band and the Jarabe tapatio, or hat dance, it was a suitable finale to a
lively evening and left the audience smiling and calling for an encore.
On a purely technical level, the dancing was sometimes quite
sloppy, and one suspects that there was often more emphasis placed
on smiling faces than on straight lines. Still, Ballet Folklorico does a
fun show and an entertaining one.
