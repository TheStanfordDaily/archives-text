Dean Disbarred In Virginia
ALEXANDRIA, Va. - A three-judge panel disbarred
former presidential counsel John W. Dean 111 yesterday for
what it called unethical, unprofessional and unwarranted
conduct in the Watergate affair.
The 35-year-old Dean, who has pleaded guilty to a
federal felony charge, did not address the court in his own
defense.
The disbarment action was brought by the Virginia State
Bar, which charged that Dean had been guilty of
unprofessional conduct by withholding evidence, inducing
another to commit perjury, authorizing payment of hush
money to the Watergate burglars and diverting money to his
own use.
The three circuit court judges found Dean guilty of
"unethical, unprofessional and unwarranted conduct as an
attorney at law violating the code of professional ethics."
They ordered that Dean's license to practice law be
revoked.
Thomas Mains, Dean's lawyer, told the court in a brief
statement that it could reprimand, suspend or disbar Dean.
"We cannot seriously contend that only a reprimand is
in order," Mains said. But he added, "The full information
in the final chapter is not yet written in Watergate. Our
feeling is that information is largely mitigating in nature as
far as Dean is concerned. We ask that the court consider
suspending Dean's license until further order of the court."
GOP Fund Raising Misses Goal
WASHINGTON — The Republican National Committee
fell about $1 million short of its fund-raising goal in 1973.
But one key official says it has survived the fallout from
Watergate in a healthier financial position than expected.
The political climate created by Watergate apparently
led to a decline in big contributions to the Democratic
National Committee, too. Nevertheless, current financial
reports indicate their regular party organization may be in
better shape than it has been for years.
From quarterly reports filed with the General
Accounting Office, here are the figures for both national
committees:
The Republicans raised $5.6 million and spent about the
same amount in 1973, ending the year with a cash balance
of $65,571.
Wage Price Controls To End Soon?
WASHINGTON - The Nixon administration told
Congress yesterday it hopes to end its 2'/2-year program of
wage and price controls on April 30, except in the health

and petroleum industries.
But Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz said controls
could be continued over additional industries.
"We have a slight reserve whether we might not put in an
added industry or two," he told the subcommittee on
production and stabilization of the Senate Banking
Committee.
He also said that although the administration intends to
continue its process of gradual decontrol of the economy
before April 30, "we may not be able to make it."
The present legislative authority for wage and price
controls expires April 30, and the subcommittee is holding
hearings on whether the authority should be extended past
that date.
Shultz said that at the present time the administration
favors continuing mandatory controls over only the health
industry past April 30 and until there is action on the
administration's national health insurance program.
California Considers Oregon Gas Plan
SACRAMENTO — The California Energy Planning
Council yesterday ordered preparation of a plan for
imposing the voluntary Oregon-style gasoline purchasing
system.
"This doesn't mean that the decision has been made to
do it, but it will be seriously considered," said Wesley
Bruer, the council's executive secretary.
He said he hopes to present the staff proposal to the
council within two days.
"We would anticipate a difficult problem around the
third week of February, with some stations beginning to
run out of their February allocations," Bruer said.
He reported the state's projected demand for gasoline
will be 820 million gallons of gasoline in February, but only
674 million gallons will be available. The Oregon system
calls for motorists buying gasoline on even numbered days
if their vehicle license plates end with an even number.
Vehicles with odd numbers would buy gas on odd
numbered days.
Out-of-state visitors, commercial and emergency vehicles
could buy gas any day.
Bruer said motorists also would be asked to avoid
purchasing gasoline unless they have less than a half-tank
remaining.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low temperatures tonight in
the mid 30s to mid 40s. High today in the 60s and
tomorrow in the mid 60s to low 70s. North to northeast
winds 10 to 20 mph becoming light winds today.

Wage Price Controls To End Soon?
WASHINGTON - The Nixon administration told
Congress yesterday it hopes to end its 2'/2-year program of
wage and price controls on April 30, except in the health

and petroleum industries.
But Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz said controls
could be continued over additional industries.
"We have a slight reserve whether we might not put in an
added industry or two," he told the subcommittee on
production and stabilization of the Senate Banking
Committee.
He also said that although the administration intends to
continue its process of gradual decontrol of the economy
before April 30, "we may not be able to make it."
The present legislative authority for wage and price
controls expires April 30, and the subcommittee is holding
hearings on whether the authority should be extended past
that date.
Shultz said that at the present time the administration
favors continuing mandatory controls over only the health
industry past April 30 and until there is action on the
administration's national health insurance program.
California Considers Oregon Gas Plan
SACRAMENTO — The California Energy Planning
Council yesterday ordered preparation of a plan for
imposing the voluntary Oregon-style gasoline purchasing
system.
"This doesn't mean that the decision has been made to
do it, but it will be seriously considered," said Wesley
Bruer, the council's executive secretary.
He said he hopes to present the staff proposal to the
council within two days.
"We would anticipate a difficult problem around the
third week of February, with some stations beginning to
run out of their February allocations," Bruer said.
He reported the state's projected demand for gasoline
will be 820 million gallons of gasoline in February, but only
674 million gallons will be available. The Oregon system
calls for motorists buying gasoline on even numbered days
if their vehicle license plates end with an even number.
Vehicles with odd numbers would buy gas on odd
numbered days.
Out-of-state visitors, commercial and emergency vehicles
could buy gas any day.
Bruer said motorists also would be asked to avoid
purchasing gasoline unless they have less than a half-tank
remaining.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low temperatures tonight in
the mid 30s to mid 40s. High today in the 60s and
tomorrow in the mid 60s to low 70s. North to northeast
winds 10 to 20 mph becoming light winds today.
Dean Disbarred In Virginia
ALEXANDRIA, Va. - A three-judge panel disbarred
former presidential counsel John W. Dean 111 yesterday for
what it called unethical, unprofessional and unwarranted
conduct in the Watergate affair.
The 35-year-old Dean, who has pleaded guilty to a
federal felony charge, did not address the court in his own
defense.
The disbarment action was brought by the Virginia State
Bar, which charged that Dean had been guilty of
unprofessional conduct by withholding evidence, inducing
another to commit perjury, authorizing payment of hush
money to the Watergate burglars and diverting money to his
own use.
The three circuit court judges found Dean guilty of
"unethical, unprofessional and unwarranted conduct as an
attorney at law violating the code of professional ethics."
They ordered that Dean's license to practice law be
revoked.
Thomas Mains, Dean's lawyer, told the court in a brief
statement that it could reprimand, suspend or disbar Dean.
"We cannot seriously contend that only a reprimand is
in order," Mains said. But he added, "The full information
in the final chapter is not yet written in Watergate. Our
feeling is that information is largely mitigating in nature as
far as Dean is concerned. We ask that the court consider
suspending Dean's license until further order of the court."
GOP Fund Raising Misses Goal
WASHINGTON — The Republican National Committee
fell about $1 million short of its fund-raising goal in 1973.
But one key official says it has survived the fallout from
Watergate in a healthier financial position than expected.
The political climate created by Watergate apparently
led to a decline in big contributions to the Democratic
National Committee, too. Nevertheless, current financial
reports indicate their regular party organization may be in
better shape than it has been for years.
From quarterly reports filed with the General
Accounting Office, here are the figures for both national
committees:
The Republicans raised $5.6 million and spent about the
same amount in 1973, ending the year with a cash balance
