# New Legal Standards Urged
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Law School Dean Thomas Ehrlich
agrees with the president of the
American Bar Association that the
legal profession needs a substantial
reevaluation of professional standards.
President Chesterfield Smith has
urged the legal profession to demand
that attorneys regularly demonstrate
their competence as a condition for
the continued practice of the law. "I
think that the basic concept is right
and sound and ought to be
implemented," commented Ehrlich,
who attended the recent ABA
convention where Smith spoke.
"There are some attorneys who don't
have the qualifications to practice and
it is difficult to protect the public
against such people unless we are able
to determine who they are."
While Ehrlich defended the tenor of
Smith's remarks, he noted that it is
not clear how a screening method
would actually be developed. It would
be difficult to form an effective
program of periodic reexamination, he
said.
