# Teaching, Research Assistants Plan Union
## 
### 
Twenty graduate students
representing teaching and research
assistants from seven University
departments met Tuesday night to
discuss plans for a possible new union.
Dorothy Rosenberg, a graduate
student in German studies who
organized the meeting, said that the
objective of the new union would be
"to develop a method by which
teaching assistants, research assistants
and even lecturing instructors can deal
with the University."
Sam Bishop, an official of the
California Federation of Teachers
(CFT) spoke at Tuesday's organizing
meeting and discussed the possibility
of the CFT representing the group.
Speaking to the teaching assistants,
Bishop said, "Your group would come
under the jurisdiction of the National
Labor Relations Act.
"Any institution that has more
than a million dollars a year can be
subject to unionization" according to
this act, Bishop said.
No Power
Currently, the assistants cannot
negotiate collectively with the
University. An individual has little or
no bargaining power, according to
Rosenberg.
"Not only has the University
refused to give a necessary pay raise
and improve our working conditions,
but they are proceding with plans that
will make our situation worse," said
Rosenberg.
The plan proposed by the
University, already in use in some
departments, gives graduate students
working as teaching assistants $1950
per year for four years, with an option
of $400 summer support.
Pay Increase
According to Rosenberg, the
University plan allows only a six
percent pay increase for the assistants,
while the cost of living has risen 18
percent.
Under the University plan.

Rosenberg said, students would be
required to complete their studies
within four years. However, it takes
the average assistant closer to seven
years to complete his graduate studies,
Rosenberg contended.
Before the group could negotiate
with the University, it would
to define its bargaining unit — the
specific group of people it represents
— and collect signed cards from at
least 50 percent of the unit as proof
that a union is wanted.
No Recognition?
According to Rosenberg, the
University would still not be
compelled to negotiate with the union.
Rosenberg speculated that the
University would refuse to recognize
the group, forcing it to seek

recognition from the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB
could compel the University to
negotiate with the union, Bishop said.
A group of Physics Department
research assistants, calling itself the
Stanford Union of Research
Assistants, is already involved in
litigation before the NLRB, according
to Sam Stein, president of that union.
"Our union wishes to concern itself
with all the problems which affect
research assistants in the Physics
Department at Stanford," Stein
declared.
Postponement Likely
Stein said a hearing before the
NLRB is currently scheduled for Feb.
12, but will probably be postponed
until later in the month.

Rosenberg said that recognition of
the Stanford Union of Research
Assistants by the NLRB may well help
speed up recognition of her group.
Possible affiliation of Rosenberg's
group with the CFT — a part of the
American Federation of Teachers and
through it, of the AFL-CIO — might
make some CFT funds and expertise
available to the group, Bishop said.
"We've never turned our backs on
anyone that I know of when they
needed help," Bishop said.
The matter will be further
considered at the Rosenberg group's
next meeting. Another item on the
agenda, she said, will be selection of a
name for the group.

Rosenberg said that recognition of
the Stanford Union of Research
Assistants by the NLRB may well help
speed up recognition of her group.
Possible affiliation of Rosenberg's
group with the CFT — a part of the
American Federation of Teachers and
through it, of the AFL-CIO — might
make some CFT funds and expertise
available to the group, Bishop said.
"We've never turned our backs on
anyone that I know of when they
needed help," Bishop said.
The matter will be further
considered at the Rosenberg group's
next meeting. Another item on the
agenda, she said, will be selection of a
name for the group.

GRAD STUDENTS UNITE? — Sam Bishop, an official of the California Federation of Teachers, and Dorothy Rosenberg
a graduate student, spoke Tuesday about the possibility of unionizing teaching and research assistants.
Twenty graduate students
representing teaching and research
assistants from seven University
departments met Tuesday night to
discuss plans for a possible new union.
Dorothy Rosenberg, a graduate
student in German studies who
organized the meeting, said that the
objective of the new union would be
"to develop a method by which
teaching assistants, research assistants
and even lecturing instructors can deal
with the University."
Sam Bishop, an official of the
California Federation of Teachers
(CFT) spoke at Tuesday's organizing
meeting and discussed the possibility
of the CFT representing the group.
Speaking to the teaching assistants,
Bishop said, "Your group would come
under the jurisdiction of the National
Labor Relations Act.
"Any institution that has more
than a million dollars a year can be
subject to unionization" according to
this act, Bishop said.
No Power
Currently, the assistants cannot
negotiate collectively with the
University. An individual has little or
no bargaining power, according to
Rosenberg.
"Not only has the University
refused to give a necessary pay raise
and improve our working conditions,
but they are proceding with plans that
will make our situation worse," said
Rosenberg.
The plan proposed by the
University, already in use in some
departments, gives graduate students
working as teaching assistants $1950
per year for four years, with an option
of $400 summer support.
Pay Increase
According to Rosenberg, the
University plan allows only a six
percent pay increase for the assistants,
while the cost of living has risen 18
percent.
Under the University plan.

Rosenberg said, students would be
required to complete their studies
within four years. However, it takes
the average assistant closer to seven
years to complete his graduate studies,
Rosenberg contended.
Before the group could negotiate
with the University, it would
to define its bargaining unit — the
specific group of people it represents
— and collect signed cards from at
least 50 percent of the unit as proof
that a union is wanted.
No Recognition?
According to Rosenberg, the
University would still not be
compelled to negotiate with the union.
Rosenberg speculated that the
University would refuse to recognize
the group, forcing it to seek

recognition from the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB
could compel the University to
negotiate with the union, Bishop said.
A group of Physics Department
research assistants, calling itself the
Stanford Union of Research
Assistants, is already involved in
litigation before the NLRB, according
to Sam Stein, president of that union.
"Our union wishes to concern itself
with all the problems which affect
research assistants in the Physics
Department at Stanford," Stein
declared.
Postponement Likely
Stein said a hearing before the
NLRB is currently scheduled for Feb.
12, but will probably be postponed
until later in the month.

Rosenberg said that recognition of
the Stanford Union of Research
Assistants by the NLRB may well help
speed up recognition of her group.
