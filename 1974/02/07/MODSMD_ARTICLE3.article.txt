# Lyman Requests Review Of Faculty Housing Plan
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
President Lyman confirmed
yesterday that he has asked the
provost's office to review the proposed
Row faculty apartment project.
(Students voted yesterday in a
referendum to express approval or
disapproval of the project. The
referendum continues today.)
Edward Shaw, executive assistant
to Vice President and Provost Robert
Augsburger, and Robert Summers,
manager of faculty-staff housing, will
conduct the review, Lyman said. Their
findings may determine whether the
issue is formally reopened in the
University Subcommittee on
Residential Development.
The proposed 100-unit complex, if
re-approved, would be built on a
five-acre May field Ave. site now
occupied by Grove House and the
Stanford Children's Center.

(Contrary to previous reports,
Lyman did not ask the subcommittee
itself to undertake the review. Instead,
Lyman said, the re-evaluation is "a
step preliminary to going to the
committee.")
Minds Not Set
"There are two ways to go into this
kind of review," Lyman said
yesterday. "One is to see if we can
plug the gaps in our argument. The
other is to ask how serious are the gaps
in the argument, and if they're serious,
do they warrant a reconsideration of
the project. We're not going in with
our minds set to find a conclusion
we've already drawn."
Shaw echoed Lyman's comment,
and said the review "could change" his
previous recommendation that the
project go ahead. "We're going in
without any preconceived notions," he
said.

"Procedurally, President Lyman has
asked us to take a look at the
programmatic, economic and site
aspects of the project. That, of course,
means with reference to the objections
raised by the Student
Senate.... We'll be looking at the
economics of the project, and at the
size. If we decide that the Row is the
preferred site, do we have to build 100
units?"
Key Elements
Shaw said architectural and design
considerations will be "the key
element," in any decisions on the
project's fate. But, he emphasized, the
project has not yet reached the design
stage.
"If the design is a bad design, it'll
never get by," he said. "There's been
some derision of the architects because
they did Escondido Village. But they
have done other things. We have every
reason to believe that if the project
moves forward, the design would be
something that would fit."
The re-evaluation will also include
another look at the "market" for a
faculty apartment complex, Shaw said.
"We haven't decided whether to do a
questionnaire, but we will take
another look at the demand for a
project of this type."
Three Weeks
Shaw said he will report his findings
to the subcommittee in about three
weeks.
The decision to review the project
represents a shift from the University's
earlier position. Last week, Augsburger
told the ASSU Senate that although
the administration had "not done a
good job of communicating with
| Row | residents," the decision to go
ahead with the project was "the right
decision."
Several members of the Board of
Trustees have reportedly expressed
doubts about the project. One trustee,
Thomas V. Jones, became interested
after his daughter, who lives in Kairos
House, told him of the controversy.
