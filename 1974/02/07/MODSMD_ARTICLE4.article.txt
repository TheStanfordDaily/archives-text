# House Committee Given Broad Subpoena Power

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House,
by a vote of 410 to 4, armed its
Judiciary Committee yesterday with
broad subpoena power to help
determine whether President Nixon
should be impeached.
Taking solemn note that only once
before in the nation's history has such
a resolution been acted on, the House
adopted it as a necessary step to meet
its constitutional duty in impeachment
cases.
"Whatever we learn," said Rep.
Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, "whatever
we conclude, the manner in which we
proceed is of historic importance — to
the country, to the presidency, to the
House, to our constitutional system
and to future generations."
The overwhelming vote for the
resolution opened a new stage in the
impeachment investigation, which has
been going on since last fall.
Rodino said the new power given to
the committee will enable it to gain
"full and complete access to any
persons, information, or things in the
custody or under control of any
agency, officer or employee of the
government of the United States,
including the President."
Possible Subpoena
Asked by Rep. Louis C. Wyman,
R-N.H., whether he intends to
subpoena Nixon, Rodino replied that
he can only answer that when he

knows whether it will be necessary for
a full investigation.
"I hope it will not become
necessary," said Wyman.
Rodino turned aside all questions
about what he intended to seek in the
way of evidence and when he would
go after it, saying those were questions
under consideration by the Judiciary
Committee and its special
impeachment staff.
The subpoena resolution also
includes authority for the committee
to compel answers to written
questions and to take depositions from
witnesses.

need for the committee to have such
powers in order to conduct an
