# House Committee Given Broad Subpoena Power
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House,
by a vote of 410 to 4, armed its
Judiciary Committee yesterday with
broad subpoena power to help
determine whether President Nixon
should be impeached.
Taking solemn note that only once
before in the nation's history has such
a resolution been acted on, the House
adopted it as a necessary step to meet
its constitutional duty in impeachment
cases.
"Whatever we learn," said Rep.
Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, "whatever
we conclude, the manner in which we
proceed is of historic importance — to
the country, to the presidency, to the
House, to our constitutional system
and to future generations."
The overwhelming vote for the
resolution opened a new stage in the
impeachment investigation, which has
been going on since last fall.
Rodino said the new power given to
the committee will enable it to gain
"full and complete access to any
persons, information, or things in the
custody or under control of any
agency, officer or employee of the
government of the United States,
including the President."
Possible Subpoena
Asked by Rep. Louis C. Wyman,
R-N.H., whether he intends to
subpoena Nixon, Rodino replied that
he can only answer that when he

knows whether it will be necessary for
a full investigation.
"I hope it will not become
necessary," said Wyman.
Rodino turned aside all questions
about what he intended to seek in the
way of evidence and when he would
go after it, saying those were questions
under consideration by the Judiciary
Committee and its special
impeachment staff.
The subpoena resolution also
includes authority for the committee
to compel answers to written
questions and to take depositions from
witnesses.
Objections
Although strongly in support of the
need for the committee to have such
powers in order to conduct an
investigation that could clear as well as
implicate Nixon, many Republicans
objected to some features of the
resolution.
Rep. Robert McClory, R-lU.,
declaring that the impeachment
inquiry will paralyze the government,
said the resolution should include an
April 30 deadline for reporting the
Judiciary Committee's
recommendation back to the House.
Rodino said he would do
everything he could to meet that date
but opposed fixing any rigid deadline.
His pledge won the backing of House
Republican Leader John J. Rodes of
Arizona, and McClory's effort to write
in the deadline was defeated 342-70.

Growing specialization among
members of the legal profession is one
of the main reasons why periodic
reevaluation of attorneys is a good
idea, Ehrlich stated. At the present
time, life-long licenses to practice law
are granted to those who pass state bar
examinations, and an attorney is
allowed to practice law in the state
unless he commits a gross misdeed. In
some states, nominal dues to the state
bar association are also required.
Often, a young attorney will take a
case in a given area of law, display an
interest in the topic, and continue to
work on cases regarding the subject,
Ehrlich explained. After many years,
he is an expert in that one area, but he
knows nothing about a myriad of
other legal fields, Ehrlich said.
In his address to the ABA, Smith
had discussed the same dilemma,
declaring, "Even the very best lawyers
are usually truly competent and
proficient in only a very few areas of
the law."
One answer to the problem would
be to give such attorneys a specialist's
title following successful completion
of an examination, Ehrlich said. At the
current time, however, such titles
constitute unauthorized advertising.
Ehrlich noted that a pilot program
now being tested in California allows
an attorney to officially specialize in
criminal law, workmen's compensation
law or tax law, if he passes a test.
"The State of California is also
considering the passage of a periodic
reexamination for attorneys," Ehrlich
added. "The state bar is wrestling with
the problem, but the actual details are
difficult to establish."
There is considerable opposition to
the suggestion of periodic
reevaluation, Ehrlich said. Some

attorneys see no need to waste their
time on reexamination. Others are
afraid they would fail to pass such an
exam. Many opponents also emphasize
the practical problems of establishing a
reexamination program.
Legal associations have long
discussed the possibility of such a
program, Ehrlich noted. But a
suggestion by the president of the
ABA should carry substantial force,
although Ehrlich added that "I don't
expect it to be passed tomorrow."

before in the nation's history has such
a resolution been acted on, the House
adopted it as a necessary step to meet
its constitutional duty in impeachment
cases.
"Whatever we learn," said Rep.
Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, "whatever
we conclude, the manner in which we
proceed is of historic importance — to
the country, to the presidency, to the
House, to our constitutional system
and to future generations."
The overwhelming vote for the
resolution opened a new stage in the
impeachment investigation, which has
been going on since last fall.
Rodino said the new power given to
the committee will enable it to gain
"full and complete access to any
persons, information, or things in the
custody or under control of any
agency, officer or employee of the
government of the United States,
including the President."
Possible Subpoena
Asked by Rep. Louis C. Wyman,
R-N.H., whether he intends to
subpoena Nixon, Rodino replied that
he can only answer that when he

knows whether it will be necessary for
a full investigation.
"I hope it will not become
necessary," said Wyman.
Rodino turned aside all questions
about what he intended to seek in the
way of evidence and when he would
go after it, saying those were questions
under consideration by the Judiciary
Committee and its special
impeachment staff.
The subpoena resolution also
includes authority for the committee
to compel answers to written
questions and to take depositions from
witnesses.
Objections
Although strongly in support of the
need for the committee to have such
powers in order to conduct an
investigation that could clear as well as
implicate Nixon, many Republicans
objected to some features of the
resolution.
Rep. Robert McClory, R-lU.,
declaring that the impeachment
inquiry will paralyze the government,
said the resolution should include an
April 30 deadline for reporting the
Judiciary Committee's
recommendation back to the House.
Rodino said he would do
everything he could to meet that date
but opposed fixing any rigid deadline.
His pledge won the backing of House
Republican Leader John J. Rodes of
Arizona, and McClory's effort to write
in the deadline was defeated 342-70.

Growing specialization among
members of the legal profession is one
of the main reasons why periodic
reevaluation of attorneys is a good
idea, Ehrlich stated. At the present
time, life-long licenses to practice law
are granted to those who pass state bar
examinations, and an attorney is
allowed to practice law in the state
unless he commits a gross misdeed. In
some states, nominal dues to the state
bar association are also required.
Often, a young attorney will take a
case in a given area of law, display an
interest in the topic, and continue to
work on cases regarding the subject,
Ehrlich explained. After many years,
he is an expert in that one area, but he
knows nothing about a myriad of
other legal fields, Ehrlich said.
In his address to the ABA, Smith
had discussed the same dilemma,
declaring, "Even the very best lawyers
are usually truly competent and
proficient in only a very few areas of
the law."
One answer to the problem would
be to give such attorneys a specialist's
title following successful completion
of an examination, Ehrlich said. At the
current time, however, such titles
constitute unauthorized advertising.
Ehrlich noted that a pilot program
now being tested in California allows
an attorney to officially specialize in
criminal law, workmen's compensation
law or tax law, if he passes a test.
"The State of California is also
considering the passage of a periodic
reexamination for attorneys," Ehrlich
added. "The state bar is wrestling with
the problem, but the actual details are
difficult to establish."
There is considerable opposition to
the suggestion of periodic
reevaluation, Ehrlich said. Some

attorneys see no need to waste their
time on reexamination. Others are
afraid they would fail to pass such an
exam. Many opponents also emphasize
the practical problems of establishing a
reexamination program.
Legal associations have long
discussed the possibility of such a
program, Ehrlich noted. But a
suggestion by the president of the
ABA should carry substantial force,
although Ehrlich added that "I don't
expect it to be passed tomorrow."
