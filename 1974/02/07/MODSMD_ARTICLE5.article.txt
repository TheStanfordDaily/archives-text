# Some Faculty Doubt Merits Of Row Site
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Students are not the only ones who
have mixed feelings about the emeritus
faculty housing complex proposed for
construction on Mayfield Avenue.
Some of the faculty members who
initially expressed interest in such a
project now have misgivings about the
present plans.
According to Faculty-Staff Housing
Manager Bob Summers, the need for
on-campus housing for emeritus,
junior and visiting faculty was
determined by a survey taken two
years ago. Of 1600 preliminary
questionnaires distributed, about 600
were returned, with half of these
indicating some interest.
A second, more detailed,
market-research questionnaire was sent
to this group, asking them if and when
they would be willing to negotiate
rental agreements. Of the 128
responses, 40 indicated a willingness to
negotiate this year, and another 45 by
next year.
Waning Interest
Since then, and for various reasons,
some interest has waned. Two central
issues on which there is disagreement
are the choice of the old Stanford
Elementary School site for
construction and the decision to offer
rentals rather than condominiums.
Prof. Roger Gray of the Food
Research Institute said there is "no
prospect" of his moving into the
proposed 100-unit apartment complex
for two reasons. He said he has "never
much favored the school location,"
and expressed doubts similar to those
of Row residents that such a complex
could be blended architecturally with
the Row.
Gray cited "other beautiful sites —
mostly at the other end of campus"
which would be more suitable.
Specifically, he mentioned the area
near Santa Teresa Street beyond
Lagunita Court, which had been
considered as a possible location. Gray
added that, from an economic
standpoint, he would prefer
condominiums to rentals.
Sarah Faulkner, wife of Emeritus
Art Prof. Ray Faulkner, said that she
and her husband were "not too
interested" in the present site, but
would consider similar housing if it
was elsewhere on campus. She
expressed their concern about
increased traffic in the area, and added

that a 100-unit complex might be too
large. In addition, the Faulkners have
some "sentimental attachment" to the
Elementary School, where their
children went to school. Faulkner's
wife added that she is pleased with the
present use of the site by the
Children's Center and the Music
Department.
Enthusiasm
However, not all of those faculty
who initially responded to the 1972
survey have changed their minds.
Ombudsman Harvey Hall, who served
on the subcommittee which
recommended the project, is
enthusiastic about it. He called the
school site "a convenient, desirable
location for someone at or near
retirement," citing its proximity to the
library, Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the
Faculty Club, Maples Pavilion and
other places of continued interest
around the University after his
retirement. "I have no desire, nor does
Mrs. Hall, to move away from this
community," he said.
Hall favors the proposed mixture of
age groups among the faculty residents
of the complex, as well as its
proximity to students. He has been
around students for a large part of his
life, he said, and does not expect that
to change suddenly. He dismissed the
question of student-generated noise in
the neighborhood being a nuisance,
saying he might "possibly be mildly
annoyed at times," and adding, "If I
can put up with their lifestyle, I think
they can tolerate mine."
Hall stressed that he would be
disappointed to see any delays, since
there is a need for such housing and
the University is already "20 years
behind the times" in meeting that
need.
Arthur Kroeger, professor of
marketing in the Graduate School of
Business, also favors the present site
for its convenience. He said he would
prefer not to be "isolated" from the
rest of the campus.
Lois Stolz, emeritus professor of
psychology, said she would prefer a
condominium, but will otherwise
probably take advantage of the new
apartments. She also stressed the
nearness to the center of campus as
important to emeriti, who are still
"very busy" with committees,
graduate students and other academic
concerns.
Summers said yesterday that a new
survey is being prepared to update
figures on faculty intent and to
"reaffirm market demand" for the
100-unit project. He also said that
construction of a limited number of
emeritus condominiums on several lots
on Mayfield will be considered, but
that the apartment complex will take
precedence. Summers expects the
results of this new survey "no sooner
than the end of the month."

results of this new survey "no sooner
than the end of the month."
Students are not the only ones who
have mixed feelings about the emeritus
faculty housing complex proposed for
construction on Mayfield Avenue.
Some of the faculty members who
initially expressed interest in such a
project now have misgivings about the
present plans.
According to Faculty-Staff Housing
Manager Bob Summers, the need for
on-campus housing for emeritus,
junior and visiting faculty was
determined by a survey taken two
years ago. Of 1600 preliminary
questionnaires distributed, about 600
were returned, with half of these
indicating some interest.
A second, more detailed,
market-research questionnaire was sent
to this group, asking them if and when
they would be willing to negotiate
rental agreements. Of the 128
responses, 40 indicated a willingness to
negotiate this year, and another 45 by
next year.
Waning Interest
Since then, and for various reasons,
some interest has waned. Two central
issues on which there is disagreement
are the choice of the old Stanford
Elementary School site for
construction and the decision to offer
rentals rather than condominiums.
Prof. Roger Gray of the Food
Research Institute said there is "no
prospect" of his moving into the
proposed 100-unit apartment complex
for two reasons. He said he has "never
much favored the school location,"
and expressed doubts similar to those
of Row residents that such a complex
could be blended architecturally with
the Row.
Gray cited "other beautiful sites —
mostly at the other end of campus"
which would be more suitable.
Specifically, he mentioned the area
near Santa Teresa Street beyond
Lagunita Court, which had been
considered as a possible location. Gray
added that, from an economic
standpoint, he would prefer
condominiums to rentals.
Sarah Faulkner, wife of Emeritus
Art Prof. Ray Faulkner, said that she
and her husband were "not too
interested" in the present site, but
would consider similar housing if it
was elsewhere on campus. She
expressed their concern about
increased traffic in the area, and added

that a 100-unit complex might be too
large. In addition, the Faulkners have
some "sentimental attachment" to the
Elementary School, where their
children went to school. Faulkner's
wife added that she is pleased with the
present use of the site by the
Children's Center and the Music
Department.
Enthusiasm
However, not all of those faculty
who initially responded to the 1972
survey have changed their minds.
Ombudsman Harvey Hall, who served
on the subcommittee which
recommended the project, is
enthusiastic about it. He called the
school site "a convenient, desirable
location for someone at or near
retirement," citing its proximity to the
library, Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the
Faculty Club, Maples Pavilion and
other places of continued interest
around the University after his
retirement. "I have no desire, nor does
Mrs. Hall, to move away from this
community," he said.
Hall favors the proposed mixture of
age groups among the faculty residents
of the complex, as well as its
proximity to students. He has been
around students for a large part of his
life, he said, and does not expect that
to change suddenly. He dismissed the
question of student-generated noise in
the neighborhood being a nuisance,
saying he might "possibly be mildly
annoyed at times," and adding, "If I
can put up with their lifestyle, I think
they can tolerate mine."
Hall stressed that he would be
disappointed to see any delays, since
there is a need for such housing and
the University is already "20 years
behind the times" in meeting that
need.
Arthur Kroeger, professor of
marketing in the Graduate School of
Business, also favors the present site
for its convenience. He said he would
prefer not to be "isolated" from the
rest of the campus.
Lois Stolz, emeritus professor of
psychology, said she would prefer a
condominium, but will otherwise
probably take advantage of the new
apartments. She also stressed the
nearness to the center of campus as
important to emeriti, who are still
"very busy" with committees,
graduate students and other academic
concerns.
Summers said yesterday that a new
survey is being prepared to update
figures on faculty intent and to
"reaffirm market demand" for the
100-unit project. He also said that
construction of a limited number of
emeritus condominiums on several lots
on Mayfield will be considered, but
that the apartment complex will take
precedence. Summers expects the
results of this new survey "no sooner
than the end of the month."
