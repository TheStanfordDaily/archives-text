Diamond's Proposed Manipulation
Editor:
Larry Diamond has stated (Daily,
Jan. 31) that political "thought and
discussion have themselves withered
away to almost nothing on this
campus." How can Mr. Diamond be so
certain that the thoughts of Stanford
students no longer dwell on political
issues? His feeling that "there seems to
be little discussion of pressing current
issues or events" cannot be accepted as
factual evidence of declining political
awareness on campus'. I challenge Mr.
Diamong to produce data supporting
his sweeping generalities.
Mr. Diamond further contends that
students' immersion in their studies is
responsible for their lack of
"awareness and sensitivity to social
issues." Is it not one's prerogative to
become immersed in whatever one sees
fit? Does not each person have the
right to pursue whatever goals he or
she desire? Or does Mr. Diamond
prefer that he dictate the amount of
time pre-medical students spend on
biology, pre-law students on American
history, or engineering students on
quantum mechanics? Will Mr.
Diamond intervene in students' lives
by soliciting graduate school admission
committees to lower their grade-point"
average requirements for applicants
who are aware and sensitive?
To eliminate the intellectual
political "stagnation" on campus, Mr.
Diamond advocates the invitation of
speakers who will come to Stanford to
"force people to think." I am curious
as to Mr. Diamond's methods of
enforced thought. Will psychological
trauma or physical torture be
employed to accomplish this
brainwashing of the Stanford student
body? Is it even possible to wring
profound revelations from students'
private minds? Furthermore, if
Stanford professors have been
impotent in provoking student
thought, what guarantee does Mr.
Diamond offer that speakers from
outside will elicit intellectual
response?
I am appalled at Mr. Diamond's
reckless condemnation of Stanford
students' social concern. I am
chagrined at his impudent revulsion of
studetns' chosen goals. I am shocked
at his proposed manipultion of
students' personal thoughts.

ROTC Return Supported
Editor:
• Rick Lau's letter headlined
"Knoke's Analysis Shallow" was well
written except that most of its points
were based on rhetoric or twisted what
was said. Let me give some examples.
In my column, I stated that ROTC
would increase academic diversity. Lau
pointed out that ROTC is not
necessary for academic diversity since
we already have SCIRE and other
undergraduate special programs.
However, I was not stating in my
column that ROTC should replace
such programs or even that it was the
ONLY way to achieve this diversity.
Also Lau is forgetting that ROTC not
only enhances academic diversity but
does it without the organizational
inertia for individual courses nor the
increased cost to the University.
In my column I suggested the
scholarship advantages in the ROTC
program. Lau rebutted that the 30-55
scholarships involved for each
incoming class was "not that big a
number anyway." I would point out
that this 30-55 for each class works
out to 120-220 all together. This is no
small number.
Lau also suggests that these
scholarships do not help "those middle
income persons who, like many of us,
have no great desire for military
service," and concludes it would be
better "to concentrate on finding
other means for making scholarships

or loans available to middle income
students." I agree with him that
perhaps such scholarships would not
help students like him but neither
would, I suspect, a series of football
scholarships benefit many students. If
he bases his arguments on his own
personal need then he should argue to
ban these as well in order to
concentrate on other more generalized
scholarships.
I would agree with Lau's implied
attitude that the military of this
country may be a cruel and murdering
force. But if we ignore the military, it
can only worsen; if we infiltrate it
with thinking humans as those that
Stanford can easily provide, it has the
potential to get better. Only if we
wanted Stanford to be an isolated
ivory tower would I agree with him
that "ROTC is incompatible with the
University."

More On College Terrace
Editor:
Stephanie Elwell's Feb. 1 letter
attacking me for my support of
proposals to realign the
Stanford/Bowdoin intersection to
reduce commuter traffic in College
Terrace is a textbook example of the
sort of tactic which tends to bring the
Stanford administration into disrepute
with the community.
The Stanford administration is
certainly entitled to present its view to
the press, but Miss Elwell should have
stated that she is an employee of the
administration's public relations
department, not an ingenuous Palo
Alto resident dismayed at what she
describes, without offering evidence,
as a "vindictive attitude" towards the
administration.
The administration's contention
that realigning the Stanford/Bowdoin
intersection would increase campus
traffic does not square with the facts.
The existing arrangement, which the
administration's Master Planner
approved, has increased traffic by
1600 cars per day on the campus
Bowdoin Street. At the same time, the
closure of Escondido Road decreased
traffic there by 2500 cars per day. The
net effect of the existing arrangement
has been to decrease campus traffic by
900 cars per day.
The basic problem with the
Stanford/Bowdoin intersection is that
years ago the Stanford administration
ignored the protests of College Terrace
residents and opened the campus
Bowdoin Street, a major arterial
designed to carry thousands of cars
daily, directly onto the College
Terrace Bowdoin Street, a
neighborhood street where people live
and children play.
In 1967 the Palo Alto City Council
asked Stanford to realign the
Stanford/Bowdoin intersection to
correct this deliberate planning
blunder. In December of 1972, after
waiting five years for the
administration to respond to its
request, the City Council decided to
hold up the annexation of
Frenchman's Terrace until the
administration chose to adopt a more
cooperative attitude. It is now 1974,
and the administration's attitude
remains the same.
