# No Advanced Degrees For Faculty Here
## 
### DIANE NORBURG 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
rejected a proposal which would have
allowed Academic Council members to
obtain advanced degrees from the
University outside of their own
departments.
The plan, submitted to the
Senate steering committee by the
Committee on Graduate Studies
(C-GS), would have lifted a
long-standing ban against further
degree work by professors. Senators
voted to retain the current policy
which allows degree conferral only
upon professors who began work
toward the degree prior to becoming
an Academic Council member.
The Senate elected to return the
proposal to the C-GS with
modifications presented in a dissenting
view by Prof. Burton Richter of
SLAC, a member of the C-GS. The
modifications were accepted by the
Senate as essential to allow for
exceptions to the rule.
The ban against further degree
work by a professor exists partly to
assure that studies do not interfere
with or burden the professor's
teaching obligations. Under this
assumption, some senators argued that
it should not fall under the Senate's
jurisdiction to decide what work
constitutes a conflict of interest or
time for a professor.
The modifications, which make it
possible but difficult for a professor to
seek a degree in another department,
were presented in a written statement
by Richter. He rejected the majority
C-GS viewpoint, which would have
allowed a professor to work toward a
degree in another department after
receiving consent from his own
department.
The Senate accepted Richter's
lengthier procedure to obtain consent
for further degree work as a result of
three major factors outlined in his
statement. He questioned the demands
plated on such a candidate's time, the
conflict of interest that might be
generated in Academic Council
members granting degrees to
themselves, and the necessity of
actually obtaining another degree to
do work in related fields.
In other major business, the
Senate heard a report from Athletics
Director Joseph H. Ruetz, which
focused on the physical education and
athletic programs.
"We want to offer the finest
teaching and sports supervision
possible," Ruetz said. "And I think
the University has done a
commendable job over the years." He
praised the 13 intercollegiate sports
here as being "conducted with
integrity."
Ruetz emphasized the financial
importance of intercollegiate athletics,
especially football, as well as the
support by the Buck Club, in
maintaining the sports program and
facilities here. He cited alumni
contributions and income from TV,
radio and the Rose Bowl as chief
determining factors in budget
planning.
Because all athletic fields and
facilities — except the Lagunita pool,
field and women's gym — are the
responsibility of the men's physical
education department, Ruetz said the
nearly $3 million annual budget is not
as enormous as it sounds.
