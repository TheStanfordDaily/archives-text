# History On Oil's Side
## The
						Oil Industry And Federal Policy

Jonathan Marshall

The apparent suddenness of the "energy crisis"
took many observers by surprise, but one aspect of
the situation hasn't changed at all in over a decade
— the pervasive pattern of oil industry influence
within the Federal government.
Wherever a State exists to mobilize the resources
of a population, interest groups will arise to claim a
share of the "social" product. The oil industry is
only exceptional in the size of the clout it wields.
As rational profit maximizers, oil companies will
always turn to government for favors when the
investment of a dollar in the political system yields
higher returns than ordinary capital expenditures.
Historically, the American political system as
yielded high returns indeed to the powerful
petroleum industry.
As far back as 1913, the oil industry won its first
tax break in the form of the oil depletion allowance.
In 1959, President Eisenhower gave his friends in
the industry special licenses to import oil under a
quota system, a program which has cost American
consumers well over $80 billion since its inception.
In 1968, a group of oil executives reportedly
offered Hubert Humphrey a million dollars if he
promised to favor retention of the oil depletion
allowance. He refused, the money went to an
eventually victorious Nixon, and the allowance
remained in effect.
Oil Contributions to CRP
In 1972, the officers and principal stockholders
of American petroleum firms contributed over $5
million to Nixon's $60.2 million campaign war
chest; the Rockefeller brothers alone gave
$268,700. An executive of a major petrochemical
firm told the Senate Watergate Committee such
contributions were made "solely because we
thought the re-election of the President was in the
best interest of the country." Congressman Les
Aspin, D-Wis., on the other hand, infers from
these figures "President Nixon's hands are tied,
preventing him from dealing effectively with the
current energy crisis."
Such large contributions would insure a large
voice for the oil industry in Washington even if the
companies were not carrying out a multimillion
dollar media blitz to get their story across to the
public. Members of the 125-member National
Petroleum Council, an industry group which advises
the Interior Department, donated more than $1.2
million to Nixon's re-election campaign, for
example. The largest single contributor on the

Council, John Shaheen of Shaheen Natural
Resources, gave $107,000. His firm was a former
client of Nixon's old law firm.
Another former client of Nixon's law firm is
Saloman Brothers, the second largest Wall Street
brokerage firm and donor of $100,000 to CRP in
1972. One of its partners, millionaire William
Simon (who contributed $15,000) moved two
months ago from his post in the Treasury
Department to become Nixon's "energy czar" as
head of the Federal Energy Agency. Formerly
chairman of the Oil Policy Committee, a panel
created to oversee and coordinate government
dealings with the oil industry, Simon has
successfully proven his loyalty to friends in that
sector.
Government Concessions
The petroleum industry would like to use its
leverage to extract special concessions from the
Federal government. It is especially interested in
obtaining drilling rights at the rich Naval Petroleum
Reserve No. 4 on the north slope of Alaska. To help
them, the Bureau of Land Management is
attempting to wrest control of the land away from
the tight-fisted Navy. Chief negotiator for the
BLM's secret maneuverings is Interior
Undersecretary John Whitaker, a former executive
from Standard Oil of California, the same company
charged with illegally draining oil from the Navy's
Elk Hills reserve in California.
Deputy Defense Secretary William Clements,
established and once headed the Pentagon's task
force on oil policy and now sits on President
Nixon's cabinet-level Energy Emergency Group.
Clements is a $100 million stockholder
in the Texas drilling firm SEDCO, one of the top
five pipeline firms in the country and a major
potential contractor in the Alaskan oil rush. The
Pentagon denies any conflict of interest problem.
With its claims of an energy crisis, the industry
has won major environmental concessions. Instead
of attacking the utilities for granting rate advantages
to large power users, Nixon has chosen to attack
environmentalists as one cause of the "energy
crisis." "I'm going to have to propose some things
that will drive the environmentalists up the wall,"
he explained a couple of months ago. "I hate to use
the word 'blackmail,' but we've got to do some
things to get them to behave."
Already, environmental groups note, the "energy

crisis" has brought suspension of the Environmental
Policy Act to allow construction of the Alaska
pipeline, delay in Congress of a bill to regulate strip
mining, and Interior Department sponsored oil shale
rush, including prospecting in such remote havens as
the Arctic National Wildlife refuge, and an all-out
attack on the Clean Air Act of 1970 requiring
automobiles and factories to reduce pollution.
Another concession won by the oil companies is
freedom from antitrust action. Back in 1970
Attorney General John Mitchell gave major firms
immunity from antitrust prosecution so they could
negotiate together from strength with the oil
exporting countries. We now know, from
documents released by Senator Church, that the
Nixon Administration actively cooperated with the
international oil companies to promote cartelization
of foreign markets and oil supplies.
The Washington Post reported last Dec. 2 that
Nixon would ask Congress to grant the oil
companies such antitrust exemptions, in the belief
that they would be "forced to cooperate and plan
for mutual action" in order to bring an end to the
"energy crisis." As William Saxbe, present Attorney
General, put it recently, "So, if we want them to get
together, we're going to have to get together under a
man from Mr. Simon's office or we're going to have
to pass a law to give them some freedom to work
together."
'Unlimited Authority'
Last December the Senate passed the National
Energy Emergency Act by a lopsided vote. Had the
bill not ultimately bogged down it would have
granted the President wide-ranging powers to
intervene in the economy and reduce the impact of
energy shortages. As Cm. Charles Mathias,
R-Md., explained at the time, "Our grant of
authority to the executive is virtually unlimited."
The Nixon Administration and the petroleum
industry would still like to stampede Congress into
passing emergency legislation to centralize economic
powers into precisely those hands which oil interests
can manipulate most easily. Only if Congress
maintains a healthy skepticism towards the claims
of the Administration-petroleum industry alliance
can we hope to prevent the oil companies from
profiting further at the public expense.
