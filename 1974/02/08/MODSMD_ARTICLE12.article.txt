# Prevent Tragic Suicides
## Replace Natural Isolation With Love 
### 
Mark Weaver

Within the past two weeks two Stanford students
have attempted suicide, tracing themselves in our
minds for a passing moment like a tear dropping
into the ocean. One of them succeeded. The other
was ironically preempted by fate. Perhaps it is a sign
of the times. The comet of the century is invisible
to the naked eye. Idealism is dead ... at least
temporarily.
The tragedy of these two people is in a sense the
tragedy of us all because the isolation which drove
them to commit suicide plagues us all in more subtle
forms. The difference between us and a suicide is
the greater degree to which we are able to replace
our natural isolation with love. Still, the fear of
being alone, the fear that a lover will be gone
tomorrow is a constant subconscious one.
Most of us have experienced those fleeting
moments of such intense apathy that life becomes
nothing more than an absurd pun, and a crescent
smile eclipses the face as if a leprechaun had just
whispered a little limerick in your ear. Moments like
these can be a reaffirmation of life, forcing you to
think about what it means to be alive.
Loneliness Greatest Fear
When such moments are prolonged they lead to a
negation and withdrawal from life. We humans fear
loneliness more than anything, except death, which
is after all the ultimate form of isolation. Suicide is
at once the most courageous and cowardly of acts.
It is the most courageous in the sense that it
confronts our most terrible fear. It is the most
cowardly in that it runs away from that same fear.
Suicide is frought with the contradictions which
plague existence itself. Only man could flee his most
terrible fear by embracing it. We are composed of
contradictions which threaten to tear us apart so we
rely on emotions to guide us at the expense of

reason.
It is much easier to understand the world in
emotional terms than in intellectual ones. It is this
human tendency which has enabled so many people
to destroy themselves. Because of its final nature,
suicide should be only a last resort. It should be an
intellectual decision, not an emotional one.
Most thoughts of self-destruction should be
communicated to others. One of the most
disturbing things about suicide is the isolation with
which it is carried out. Very few ever communicate
their intent to another being. Isolation is the milieu
in which suicide breeds. This isolation can only
destroy and must be combatted how ever difficult
the task. N
I am reminded of a sleepless night I spent some
years ago when isolation threatened to overwhelm
me. My heart raced from fear aroused as I realized
that at that moment I literally did not care if I died.
It was a scary feeling. There is no hope in such a
situation. Communication holds the possibility of
redemption.
Similarity to Kirilov
All of this brings to mind Kirilov, one of the
characters of Fyodor Dostoevsky's powerful classic,
The Possessed. Kirilov is the fascinating anti-Christ
who concludes he must prove God's, and therefore
man's, existence by taking his life, thus ensuring the
salvation of mankind. He reasons that suicide is the
supreme act cf free will and that if he can be the
first man in history to exercise this free will by
killing himself, he will become God and thus prove
for all men that God does exist.
During the course of this pondering Kirilov
projects himself standing at the bottom of a cliff
over which a twenty ton boulder is hanging. He
wonden> why, although were the rock to fall, death

would be painless and instantaneous, he shakes with
fear. He realizes the fear of death is more the fear of
the finality and aloneness than it is the fear of pain,
and commits himself to becoming the first man to
die without fear. So Kirilov kills himself but no one
heralds him as the new messiah. Dostoevsky's point
is that Kirilov's abstract philosophical isolation and
inability to communicate with others destroyed
him.
All Are Isolated
The isolation and aloneness which are dramatized
by Kirilov's destruction are present in all of us,
occasionally surfacing in the darker moments, often
worrying us in the lighter ones. We experience this
most ascendant of fears in empathizing with the
possessed girl of The Exorcist. Her plight is the most
frightening in that it is undergone in absolute
isolation.
Once the demon has taken hold neither her
mother, the doctors, or psychiatrists, can help her.
Even religion fails to rout the devil. The exorcist
must discard his religious ritual. Love is what
prompts him to summon the demon into himself to
rid the girl of it.
The fear of loneliness has lured too many people
to prostitute themselves before false religious idols,
be they gurus or Christ, at the expense of genuine
love emanating from the individual himself. Love is
cheapened when it flows from behind a religious
facade. We must strive to reach out to each other in
daily life, lest we succumb to the isolation and
alienation which drove our two fellow students to
suicide.
