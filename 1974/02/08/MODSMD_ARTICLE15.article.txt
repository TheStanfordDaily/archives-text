# Moody Blues 'Take Off' And Dazzle Arena Crowd
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
OAKLAND - "We'll get it in
tune correctly and then we'll take
off," one of the five shadowy
figures on the stage announced.
Then out of the darkness,
wispy clouds of smoke began
swirling around the stage, drifting
down into the audience. And as
the smoke dissipated, the
effervescent Moody Blues did, in
fact, take off lifting the audien
"Higher and Higher," the title of

their introductory number.
The capacity crowd of 14,000
at the Oakland Coliseum last
Thursday night hung on for the
ride as the Moodies spun off on a
journey of pure magic.
The clouds of smoke were
generated by cannisters of carbon
dioxide on the back of the stage.
The music was generated by five
of the best musicians in the
v.">rld: glamorous Justin Hayward
on lead guitar, Ray Thomas on

flute and saxophone, Benjamin
Franklin look-alike Mike Pinder
on mellotron, John Lodge on bass
guitar and Graeme Edge on
drums.
Individual Talent
The incredible thing about the
Moodies is that each one of them,
with the possible exception of
Edge, could unquestionably be
immensely successful on his own.
Despite the diverse talents of the
five group members, their albums

have a sense of unity unparalleled
in modern music. So the Moodies
are a wonderful paradox, with
each performer a phenomenon in
his own right and yet an integral
part of a perfectly balanced
musical group at the same time.
With five superstars blended into
one, the Moodies are that much
better than almost any other
group around.
Although a rumor has been
circulating that a new Moody
Blues album is due shortly, all the
material the group played last
week was familiar. However, if
there is one major criticism of the
concert, it is that the group put
new musical variations into many
of its songs which, frankly, did
not measure up to the familiar
recorded versions. But this
problem certainly couldn't bring
down the overall stellar quality of
the concert.
Magic Mellotron
Mike Pinder's mellotron —
which resembles a souped-up
organ — is one of the most unique
features of the group's music since
it can faithfully reproduce the
sounds of many different
instruments including the entire
string section of a symphony
orchestra. The group recorded
Days of Future Passed in 1968
with the London Festival
Orchestra to produce a brilliant
musical innovation. Yet when the
orchestra was missing from
subsequent Moodies' albums, its
absence was hardly noticed. The
Moody Blues are most likely the
only musicians in the world who
can lose an entire symphony
orchestra and not sound
noticeably different.
Following "Higher and

Higher," which is more of a
musical introduction than an
actual song, the Moodies glided
into Pinder's cosmic "Out and In"
from To Our Children's Children's
Children. The song ranks among
the Moodies' best, but is perhaps a
little slow to use at the beginning
of a concert.
Next came Hayward's big AM
hit of two years ago, "The Story
in Your Eyes," which elated the
crowd. The blending of voices on
this song typifies the rare quality
of harmony the Moodies achieve
on practically every song.
The group journeyed on with
Lodge's two-part "One More Time
to Live," which features a piercing
Ray Thomas flute during the
song's slower sections. The way
the group broke in sharply with the
song's loud chorus immediately
after the quiet, pretty main verses
produced a dramatic, thunderous
effect.
'Tuesday Afternoon'
A slightly different and
disappointing version of
Hayward's dreamy "Tuesday
Afternoon" followed. Pinder's
mellotron, which is usually the
backbone of the song, was
unfortunately subdued and
therefore much of the body of the
song was lost.
Ray Thomas' musically
intricate "Legend of the Mind,"
commonly referred to as
"Timothy Leary'sDead," appeared
next. Thomas' flute-playing
dominated the instrumental
section in the middle of "Legend"
giving him a chance to completely
mesmerize the crowd.
Pinder's overpowering
mellotron surfaced again on
Hayward's peaceful "Watching and

Waiting" before the group
slithered into what is probably
this reporter's favorite Moodies'
song, Ray Thomas' cool "Eternity
Road."
The pretentiousness that the
Moodies are often criticized for,
usually unjustly, did appear in
spots, as when Thomas described
a three-song segment from On the
Threshold of a Dream as three
"movements," but such things
are, in the end, trivial when
compared with the group's
musical abilities.
White Satin
The songs from Threshold
brought the entire crowd
screaming to its collective feet and
the Moodies kept the audience
alive by flowing into
Hayward's "Nights in White
Satin," a song released six years
ago which has become one of the
true classics in modern music.
The group's most recent single,
"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and
Roll Band," by John Lodge, kept
the crowd pleased, but the
observation by other reviewers
that the song just doesn't fit in
with the rest of the Moodies'
material seems justified.
The string of AM hits played at
the concert reached its crest with
Hayward's "Question" which also
never quite seemed to fit the
Moodies' mold. The song always
seemed more specifically attuned
to an AM audience than are most
Moody songs. The concert
rendition of the song was
perfectly synchronized as the loud
parts, the soft parts and the vocal
harmony all blended together in
one mind-boggling arrangement.
As the crowd leapt up after
"Question" to show its heartfelt

approval, the magic Moodies'
plane prepared for descent. The
voyage was almost over.
When the Moodies came to the
front of the stage, bowed and left,
the crowd went through the usual
process, although sincerely felt, of
clapping and stomping wildly for
an encore, and the Coliseum lights
remained dark in anticipation.
Thousand Lights
The magic cruise had not yet
ended. Out of nowhere, a few at a
time, thousands of lighted
matches appeared throughout the
audience casting an orange glow
over jthe entire Coliseum. The
dream had to go on at least a little
longer.
The Moodies reappeared to
perform a satisfying rendition of
Lodge's classic rocker, "Ride My
See Saw," and the house lights
came on during the song to
prepare the audience for a safe
landing.
Touchdown was smooth, and
the Moodies and their 14,000
fellow voyagers went their
separate ways as the slightly les*
than two hour dream began to
fade into a pleasant memory.
Guitarist Sean Phillips
preceded the Moodies and played
an original, if not entirely
satisfying, opening set. Phillips
played a double-necked half-six,
half-12 string electric guitar, and
performed a kind of acid-folk
music, if that is comprehensible.
He sang like a folksinger but all of
his equipment produced heavy,
modern sounds. Phillips has the
potential to become a first-rate
musical talent if he makes some
improvements.

into Pinder's cosmic "Out and In"
from To Our Children's Children's
Children. The song ranks among
the Moodies' best, but is perhaps a
little slow to use at the beginning
of a concert.
Next came Hayward's big AM
hit of two years ago, "The Story
in Your Eyes," which elated the
crowd. The blending of voices on
this song typifies the rare quality
of harmony the Moodies achieve
on practically every song.
The group journeyed on with
Lodge's two-part "One More Time
to Live," which features a piercing
Ray Thomas flute during the
song's slower sections. The way
the group broke in sharply with the
song's loud chorus immediately
after the quiet, pretty main verses
produced a dramatic, thunderous
effect.
'Tuesday Afternoon'
A slightly different and
disappointing version of
Hayward's dreamy "Tuesday
Afternoon" followed. Pinder's
mellotron, which is usually the
backbone of the song, was
unfortunately subdued and
therefore much of the body of the
song was lost.
Ray Thomas' musically
intricate "Legend of the Mind,"
commonly referred to as
"Timothy Leary'sDead," appeared
next. Thomas' flute-playing
dominated the instrumental
section in the middle of "Legend"
giving him a chance to completely
mesmerize the crowd.
Pinder's overpowering
mellotron surfaced again on
Hayward's peaceful "Watching and

Waiting" before the group
slithered into what is probably
this reporter's favorite Moodies'
song, Ray Thomas' cool "Eternity
Road."
The pretentiousness that the
Moodies are often criticized for,
usually unjustly, did appear in
spots, as when Thomas described
a three-song segment from On the
Threshold of a Dream as three
"movements," but such things
are, in the end, trivial when
compared with the group's
musical abilities.
White Satin
The songs from Threshold
brought the entire crowd
screaming to its collective feet and
the Moodies kept the audience
alive by flowing into
Hayward's "Nights in White
Satin," a song released six years
ago which has become one of the
true classics in modern music.
The group's most recent single,
"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and
Roll Band," by John Lodge, kept
the crowd pleased, but the
observation by other reviewers
that the song just doesn't fit in
with the rest of the Moodies'
material seems justified.
The string of AM hits played at
the concert reached its crest with
Hayward's "Question" which also
never quite seemed to fit the
Moodies' mold. The song always
seemed more specifically attuned
to an AM audience than are most
Moody songs. The concert
rendition of the song was
perfectly synchronized as the loud
parts, the soft parts and the vocal
harmony all blended together in
one mind-boggling arrangement.
As the crowd leapt up after
"Question" to show its heartfelt

approval, the magic Moodies'
plane prepared for descent. The
voyage was almost over.
When the Moodies came to the
front of the stage, bowed and left,
the crowd went through the usual
process, although sincerely felt, of
clapping and stomping wildly for
an encore, and the Coliseum lights
remained dark in anticipation.
Thousand Lights
The magic cruise had not yet
ended. Out of nowhere, a few at a
time, thousands of lighted
matches appeared throughout the
audience casting an orange glow
over jthe entire Coliseum. The
dream had to go on at least a little
longer.
The Moodies reappeared to
perform a satisfying rendition of
Lodge's classic rocker, "Ride My
See Saw," and the house lights
came on during the song to
prepare the audience for a safe
landing.
Touchdown was smooth, and
the Moodies and their 14,000
fellow voyagers went their
separate ways as the slightly les*
than two hour dream began to
fade into a pleasant memory.
Guitarist Sean Phillips
preceded the Moodies and played
an original, if not entirely
satisfying, opening set. Phillips
played a double-necked half-six,
half-12 string electric guitar, and
performed a kind of acid-folk
music, if that is comprehensible.
He sang like a folksinger but all of
his equipment produced heavy,
modern sounds. Phillips has the
potential to become a first-rate
musical talent if he makes some
improvements.
OAKLAND - "We'll get it in
tune correctly and then we'll take
off," one of the five shadowy
figures on the stage announced.
Then out of the darkness,
wispy clouds of smoke began
swirling around the stage, drifting
down into the audience. And as
the smoke dissipated, the
effervescent Moody Blues did, in
fact, take off lifting the audien
"Higher and Higher," the title of

their introductory number.
The capacity crowd of 14,000
at the Oakland Coliseum last
Thursday night hung on for the
ride as the Moodies spun off on a
journey of pure magic.
The clouds of smoke were
generated by cannisters of carbon
dioxide on the back of the stage.
The music was generated by five
of the best musicians in the
v.">rld: glamorous Justin Hayward
on lead guitar, Ray Thomas on

flute and saxophone, Benjamin
Franklin look-alike Mike Pinder
on mellotron, John Lodge on bass
guitar and Graeme Edge on
drums.
Individual Talent
The incredible thing about the
Moodies is that each one of them,
with the possible exception of
Edge, could unquestionably be
immensely successful on his own.
Despite the diverse talents of the
five group members, their albums

have a sense of unity unparalleled
in modern music. So the Moodies
are a wonderful paradox, with
each performer a phenomenon in
his own right and yet an integral
part of a perfectly balanced
musical group at the same time.
With five superstars blended into
one, the Moodies are that much
better than almost any other
group around.
Although a rumor has been
circulating that a new Moody
Blues album is due shortly, all the
material the group played last
week was familiar. However, if
there is one major criticism of the
concert, it is that the group put
new musical variations into many
of its songs which, frankly, did
not measure up to the familiar
recorded versions. But this
problem certainly couldn't bring
down the overall stellar quality of
the concert.
Magic Mellotron
Mike Pinder's mellotron —
which resembles a souped-up
organ — is one of the most unique
features of the group's music since
it can faithfully reproduce the
sounds of many different
instruments including the entire
string section of a symphony
orchestra. The group recorded
Days of Future Passed in 1968
with the London Festival
Orchestra to produce a brilliant
musical innovation. Yet when the
orchestra was missing from
subsequent Moodies' albums, its
absence was hardly noticed. The
Moody Blues are most likely the
only musicians in the world who
can lose an entire symphony
orchestra and not sound
noticeably different.
Following "Higher and

Higher," which is more of a
musical introduction than an
actual song, the Moodies glided
into Pinder's cosmic "Out and In"
from To Our Children's Children's
Children. The song ranks among
the Moodies' best, but is perhaps a

parts, the soft parts and the vocal
harmony all blended together in
one mind-boggling arrangement.
As the crowd leapt up after
"Question" to show its heartfelt

approval, the magic Moodies'
plane prepared for descent. The
voyage was almost over.
When the Moodies came to the
front of the stage, bowed and left,
the crowd went through the usual
process, although sincerely felt, of
clapping and stomping wildly for
an encore, and the Coliseum lights
remained dark in anticipation.
Thousand Lights
The magic cruise had not yet
ended. Out of nowhere, a few at a
time, thousands of lighted
matches appeared throughout the
audience casting an orange glow
over jthe entire Coliseum. The
dream had to go on at least a little
longer.
The Moodies reappeared to
perform a satisfying rendition of
Lodge's classic rocker, "Ride My
See Saw," and the house lights
came on during the song to
prepare the audience for a safe
landing.
Touchdown was smooth, and
the Moodies and their 14,000
fellow voyagers went their
separate ways as the slightly les*
than two hour dream began to
fade into a pleasant memory.
Guitarist Sean Phillips
preceded the Moodies and played
an original, if not entirely
satisfying, opening set. Phillips
played a double-necked half-six,
half-12 string electric guitar, and
performed a kind of acid-folk
music, if that is comprehensible.
He sang like a folksinger but all of
his equipment produced heavy,
modern sounds. Phillips has the
potential to become a first-rate
musical talent if he makes some
improvements.
OAKLAND - "We'll get it in
tune correctly and then we'll take
off," one of the five shadowy
figures on the stage announced.
Then out of the darkness,
wispy clouds of smoke began
swirling around the stage, drifting
down into the audience. And as
the smoke dissipated, the
effervescent Moody Blues did, in
fact, take off lifting the audien
"Higher and Higher," the title of

their introductory number.
The capacity crowd of 14,000
at the Oakland Coliseum last
Thursday night hung on for the
ride as the Moodies spun off on a
journey of pure magic.
The clouds of smoke were
generated by cannisters of carbon
dioxide on the back of the stage.
The music was generated by five
of the best musicians in the
v.">rld: glamorous Justin Hayward
on lead guitar, Ray Thomas on

flute and saxophone, Benjamin
Franklin look-alike Mike Pinder
on mellotron, John Lodge on bass
guitar and Graeme Edge on
drums.
Individual Talent
The incredible thing about the
Moodies is that each one of them,
with the possible exception of
Edge, could unquestionably be
immensely successful on his own.
Despite the diverse talents of the
five group members, their albums

have a sense of unity unparalleled
in modern music. So the Moodies
are a wonderful paradox, with
each performer a phenomenon in
his own right and yet an integral
part of a perfectly balanced
musical group at the same time.
With five superstars blended into
one, the Moodies are that much
better than almost any other
group around.
Although a rumor has been
circulating that a new Moody
Blues album is due shortly, all the
material the group played last
week was familiar. However, if
there is one major criticism of the
concert, it is that the group put
new musical variations into many
of its songs which, frankly, did
not measure up to the familiar
recorded versions. But this
problem certainly couldn't bring
down the overall stellar quality of
the concert.
Magic Mellotron
Mike Pinder's mellotron —
which resembles a souped-up
organ — is one of the most unique
features of the group's music since
it can faithfully reproduce the
sounds of many different
instruments including the entire
string section of a symphony
orchestra. The group recorded
Days of Future Passed in 1968
with the London Festival
Orchestra to produce a brilliant
musical innovation. Yet when the
orchestra was missing from
subsequent Moodies' albums, its
absence was hardly noticed. The
Moody Blues are most likely the
only musicians in the world who
can lose an entire symphony
orchestra and not sound
noticeably different.
Following "Higher and

Higher," which is more of a
musical introduction than an
actual song, the Moodies glided
into Pinder's cosmic "Out and In"
from To Our Children's Children's
Children. The song ranks among
the Moodies' best, but is perhaps a
little slow to use at the beginning
of a concert.
Next came Hayward's big AM
hit of two years ago, "The Story
in Your Eyes," which elated the
crowd. The blending of voices on
this song typifies the rare quality
of harmony the Moodies achieve
on practically every song.
The group journeyed on with
Lodge's two-part "One More Time
to Live," which features a piercing
Ray Thomas flute during the
song's slower sections. The way
the group broke in sharply with the
song's loud chorus immediately
after the quiet, pretty main verses
produced a dramatic, thunderous
effect.
'Tuesday Afternoon'
A slightly different and
disappointing version of
Hayward's dreamy "Tuesday
Afternoon" followed. Pinder's
mellotron, which is usually the
backbone of the song, was
unfortunately subdued and
therefore much of the body of the
song was lost.
Ray Thomas' musically
intricate "Legend of the Mind,"
commonly referred to as
"Timothy Leary'sDead," appeared
next. Thomas' flute-playing
dominated the instrumental
section in the middle of "Legend"
giving him a chance to completely
mesmerize the crowd.
Pinder's overpowering
mellotron surfaced again on
Hayward's peaceful "Watching and

Waiting" before the group
slithered into what is probably
this reporter's favorite Moodies'
song, Ray Thomas' cool "Eternity
Road."
The pretentiousness that the
Moodies are often criticized for,
usually unjustly, did appear in
spots, as when Thomas described
a three-song segment from On the
Threshold of a Dream as three
"movements," but such things
are, in the end, trivial when
compared with the group's
musical abilities.
White Satin
The songs from Threshold
brought the entire crowd
screaming to its collective feet and
the Moodies kept the audience
alive by flowing into
Hayward's "Nights in White
Satin," a song released six years
ago which has become one of the
true classics in modern music.
The group's most recent single,
"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and
Roll Band," by John Lodge, kept
the crowd pleased, but the
observation by other reviewers
that the song just doesn't fit in
with the rest of the Moodies'
material seems justified.
The string of AM hits played at
the concert reached its crest with
Hayward's "Question" which also
never quite seemed to fit the
Moodies' mold. The song always
seemed more specifically attuned
to an AM audience than are most
Moody songs. The concert
rendition of the song was
perfectly synchronized as the loud
parts, the soft parts and the vocal
harmony all blended together in
one mind-boggling arrangement.

Despite the diverse talents of the
five group members, their albums

have a sense of unity unparalleled
in modern music. So the Moodies
are a wonderful paradox, with
each performer a phenomenon in
his own right and yet an integral
part of a perfectly balanced
musical group at the same time.
With five superstars blended into
one, the Moodies are that much
better than almost any other
group around.
Although a rumor has been
circulating that a new Moody
Blues album is due shortly, all the
material the group played last
week was familiar. However, if
there is one major criticism of the
concert, it is that the group put
new musical variations into many
of its songs which, frankly, did
not measure up to the familiar
recorded versions. But this
problem certainly couldn't bring
down the overall stellar quality of
the concert.
Magic Mellotron
Mike Pinder's mellotron —
which resembles a souped-up
organ — is one of the most unique
features of the group's music since
it can faithfully reproduce the
sounds of many different
instruments including the entire
string section of a symphony
orchestra. The group recorded
Days of Future Passed in 1968
with the London Festival
Orchestra to produce a brilliant
musical innovation. Yet when the
orchestra was missing from
subsequent Moodies' albums, its
absence was hardly noticed. The
Moody Blues are most likely the
only musicians in the world who
can lose an entire symphony
orchestra and not sound
noticeably different.
Following "Higher and

Higher," which is more of a
musical introduction than an
actual song, the Moodies glided
into Pinder's cosmic "Out and In"
from To Our Children's Children's
Children. The song ranks among
the Moodies' best, but is perhaps a
little slow to use at the beginning
of a concert.
Next came Hayward's big AM
hit of two years ago, "The Story
in Your Eyes," which elated the
crowd. The blending of voices on
this song typifies the rare quality
of harmony the Moodies achieve
on practically every song.
The group journeyed on with
Lodge's two-part "One More Time
to Live," which features a piercing
Ray Thomas flute during the
song's slower sections. The way
the group broke in sharply with the
song's loud chorus immediately
after the quiet, pretty main verses
produced a dramatic, thunderous
effect.
'Tuesday Afternoon'
A slightly different and
disappointing version of
Hayward's dreamy "Tuesday
Afternoon" followed. Pinder's
mellotron, which is usually the
backbone of the song, was
unfortunately subdued and
therefore much of the body of the
song was lost.
Ray Thomas' musically
intricate "Legend of the Mind,"
commonly referred to as
"Timothy Leary'sDead," appeared
next. Thomas' flute-playing
dominated the instrumental
section in the middle of "Legend"
giving him a chance to completely
mesmerize the crowd.
Pinder's overpowering
mellotron surfaced again on
Hayward's peaceful "Watching and

Waiting" before the group
slithered into what is probably
this reporter's favorite Moodies'
song, Ray Thomas' cool "Eternity
Road."
The pretentiousness that the
Moodies are often criticized for,
usually unjustly, did appear in
spots, as when Thomas described
a three-song segment from On the
Threshold of a Dream as three
"movements," but such things
are, in the end, trivial when
compared with the group's
musical abilities.
White Satin
The songs from Threshold
brought the entire crowd
screaming to its collective feet and
the Moodies kept the audience
alive by flowing into
Hayward's "Nights in White
Satin," a song released six years
ago which has become one of the
true classics in modern music.
The group's most recent single,
"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and
Roll Band," by John Lodge, kept
the crowd pleased, but the
observation by other reviewers
that the song just doesn't fit in
with the rest of the Moodies'
material seems justified.
The string of AM hits played at
the concert reached its crest with
Hayward's "Question" which also
never quite seemed to fit the
Moodies' mold. The song always
seemed more specifically attuned
to an AM audience than are most
Moody songs. The concert
rendition of the song was
perfectly synchronized as the loud
parts, the soft parts and the vocal
harmony all blended together in
one mind-boggling arrangement.
As the crowd leapt up after
"Question" to show its heartfelt

approval, the magic Moodies'
plane prepared for descent. The
voyage was almost over.
When the Moodies came to the
front of the stage, bowed and left,
the crowd went through the usual
process, although sincerely felt, of
clapping and stomping wildly for
an encore, and the Coliseum lights
remained dark in anticipation.
Thousand Lights
The magic cruise had not yet
ended. Out of nowhere, a few at a
time, thousands of lighted
matches appeared throughout the
audience casting an orange glow
over jthe entire Coliseum. The
dream had to go on at least a little
longer.
The Moodies reappeared to
perform a satisfying rendition of
Lodge's classic rocker, "Ride My
See Saw," and the house lights
came on during the song to
prepare the audience for a safe
landing.
Touchdown was smooth, and
the Moodies and their 14,000
fellow voyagers went their
separate ways as the slightly les*
than two hour dream began to
fade into a pleasant memory.
Guitarist Sean Phillips
preceded the Moodies and played
an original, if not entirely
satisfying, opening set. Phillips
played a double-necked half-six,
half-12 string electric guitar, and
performed a kind of acid-folk
music, if that is comprehensible.
He sang like a folksinger but all of
his equipment produced heavy,
modern sounds. Phillips has the
potential to become a first-rate
musical talent if he makes some
improvements.
