# Kenny Rankin, Patti Dolstrom Perform At The Boarding House
## 
### WILLIAM BURKE 
P SAN FRANCISCO — The Boarding House
& opened last week with Patti Dolstrom and had
8 Kenny Rankin as the main bill; the music was
well worth the trip to the City.
" Dolstrom sang a series of her own songs for
j| the most part, using a very fine back-up band of
g some individual reknown. Dolstrom played piano
jfi during one song, and her show was good enough
£ that we stayed and saw her second act before
8 heading home. The second show was more lively,
sj With "100 Alibis" she finally got some rock into
H her show, but openly confessed that was the
& only steamer they really knew.
f| Between her acts, Kenny Rankin appeared
u piecemeal with a group on stage opening with a
« series of soft rhythmic numbers which set the
8 pattern for the entire show. Rhythms are the
0 basis for his fine vocalizing and open the way for
S some excellent jamming possibilities. There is a
v lot of badadadadababadabada to the music, with
$ lyrics apparently secondary.
* "Four Days Gone" by Steve Stills temporarily
* brought Rankin's band to life, demonstrating
some very relaxed but concentrated work by Jim
* Michaels, who plays a superb lead to compliment

Rankin's rhythm guitar and vocals. From this
they quickly moved into "Comin' Down," the
song that Rankin is probably most often
associated with; again, Michaels was sublime.
Rankin then introduced his band, and frankly
I'd been waiting for two songs to find out who
the percussionsist (GlenCronkite) was. His minor
rhythms combined with a soft snare by the
drummer made an excellent base for Rankin's
rhythm guitar. Rankin moved into "Blackbird,"
the finest song of the set.
Turning to old gold, the band played "Why
Do Fools Fall in Love" with a little jazz upbeat
that was followed by "It's Oh So Peaceful Here,"
their version making Helen Reddy's seem mighty
AM-ish. Cronkite moved into the spotlight in
several short segments almost snakelike with his
various percussion pieces.
The band came back for a short encore of
"Goin' Home," Rankin and Michaels
interplaying spectacularly along the bassline. The
show really turned out to be a fine performance;
although the members of the group are old pros,
they had been together only three weeks.
Hopefully, they'll hang together for a good long
while.

* Michaels, who plays a superb lead to compliment

Rankin's rhythm guitar and vocals. From this
they quickly moved into "Comin' Down," the
song that Rankin is probably most often
associated with; again, Michaels was sublime.
Rankin then introduced his band, and frankly
I'd been waiting for two songs to find out who
the percussionsist (GlenCronkite) was. His minor
rhythms combined with a soft snare by the
drummer made an excellent base for Rankin's
rhythm guitar. Rankin moved into "Blackbird,"
the finest song of the set.
Turning to old gold, the band played "Why
Do Fools Fall in Love" with a little jazz upbeat
that was followed by "It's Oh So Peaceful Here,"
their version making Helen Reddy's seem mighty
AM-ish. Cronkite moved into the spotlight in
several short segments almost snakelike with his
various percussion pieces.
The band came back for a short encore of
"Goin' Home," Rankin and Michaels
interplaying spectacularly along the bassline. The
show really turned out to be a fine performance;
although the members of the group are old pros,
they had been together only three weeks.
Hopefully, they'll hang together for a good long
while.
