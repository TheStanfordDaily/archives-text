# Dave Alexander Plays A 'History Of Blues'
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
S Jazz-blues pianist and singer Dave Alexander came to
vMonday night to give the members of an undergraduate
?class some first-hand experience in their subject matter. £
i Performing in the Burbank lounge before the students of U.S. 7,?
of the Blues, Alexander talked about and played the blues?
fcin its many forms, with a liberal sprinkling of his own tunes. $
He began with a simple 12-bar country blues, "Sufferin' With&
the Low Down Blues," then went through several specialized \
forms, including boogie woogie and what white musicians later/
popularized as rock and roll. ?
Alexander showed many different styles of boogie woogie, from y
what he called a "half brother to the country blues" to the
sophisticated, uptown-Park Avenue boogie woogie," complete with&
quotations from classical piano pieces. One of his slower pieces £
featured the kind of tricky syncopation usually associated with/
ragtime, but with a typical boogie woogie "walking" bass line. *
Black Cowboy Blues j
One original piece, "The Dirt on the Ground," told the story of\
a black cowboy in a racist Old West town. This song has afc
"clip-clop" bass line like Roy Rogers' "Happy Trails," yet in tone£
and phrasing it is definitely blues. 112
He then passed to another "distantkinsman" of the basic blues, 3
the Kansas City sound. The sound is still the blues, but "slicker and a
cooler" than its country cousin. Alexander explained that the
musicians like Charlie Parker and Max Roach were "just playing £
the blues, the same as Muddy Waters, but with more frosting on £
the cake." Alexander's rendition, while obviously rooted in the?
blues, showed the influence of later jazzmen, including MoseJ
Allison among many others. 3
Alexander played his way with ease through rhythm and bluest
("Great Balls of Fire"), beautiful ballads, and the gospel influence
of Ray Charles, then announced that "Beethoven played the
blues." He told of first hearing the "Moonlight" Sonata, and 2
thinking it "sounded a little like Muddy Waters." He went on to >
play one of his best songs of the evening, "The Day the Ravens >
Danced in the Street," which works off the same bass line. \
Blues Sampler {
Continuing with his sampler of blues popularizers, he played
Nat "King" Cole's "Route 66" and parts of several Fats Domino j
tunes, then returned for a while to Ray Charles, playing "What'd I jj
Say," the tune which finally broke him to the top. After doing >
Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen," Alexander returned to his (
own material, including "It's a Fight, Y'all," the rarely-heard "The
Judgement," his own version of "Staggerlee" and an incredibly fast
boogie woogie called "The Rattler."
The evening was a rare double treat, for it offered a chance to
hear a rising local artist as well as an authoritative treatment of the *
history of the blues. Alexander is currently appearing through
Sundav at the Boarding House with Esther Phillips. i

Alexander showed many different styles of boogie woogie, from y
what he called a "half brother to the country blues" to the
sophisticated, uptown-Park Avenue boogie woogie," complete with&
quotations from classical piano pieces. One of his slower pieces £
featured the kind of tricky syncopation usually associated with/
ragtime, but with a typical boogie woogie "walking" bass line. *
Black Cowboy Blues j
One original piece, "The Dirt on the Ground," told the story of\
a black cowboy in a racist Old West town. This song has afc
"clip-clop" bass line like Roy Rogers' "Happy Trails," yet in tone£
and phrasing it is definitely blues. 112
He then passed to another "distantkinsman" of the basic blues, 3
the Kansas City sound. The sound is still the blues, but "slicker and a
cooler" than its country cousin. Alexander explained that the
musicians like Charlie Parker and Max Roach were "just playing £
the blues, the same as Muddy Waters, but with more frosting on £
the cake." Alexander's rendition, while obviously rooted in the?
blues, showed the influence of later jazzmen, including MoseJ
Allison among many others. 3
Alexander played his way with ease through rhythm and bluest
("Great Balls of Fire"), beautiful ballads, and the gospel influence
of Ray Charles, then announced that "Beethoven played the
blues." He told of first hearing the "Moonlight" Sonata, and 2
thinking it "sounded a little like Muddy Waters." He went on to >
play one of his best songs of the evening, "The Day the Ravens >
Danced in the Street," which works off the same bass line. \
Blues Sampler {
Continuing with his sampler of blues popularizers, he played
Nat "King" Cole's "Route 66" and parts of several Fats Domino j
tunes, then returned for a while to Ray Charles, playing "What'd I jj
Say," the tune which finally broke him to the top. After doing >
Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen," Alexander returned to his (
own material, including "It's a Fight, Y'all," the rarely-heard "The
Judgement," his own version of "Staggerlee" and an incredibly fast
boogie woogie called "The Rattler."
The evening was a rare double treat, for it offered a chance to
hear a rising local artist as well as an authoritative treatment of the *
history of the blues. Alexander is currently appearing through
Sundav at the Boarding House with Esther Phillips. i

fcin its many forms, with a liberal sprinkling of his own tunes. $

the Low Down Blues," then went through several specialized \
forms, including boogie woogie and what white musicians later/
popularized as rock and roll. ?
