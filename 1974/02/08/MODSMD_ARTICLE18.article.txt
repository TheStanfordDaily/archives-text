# 'Gorf' Accused Of Mert, Gert Murders
## 
### LAURA PULA 
SAN FRANCISCO - When a
troop of shaggy, rather
disreputable-looking angels
padded across the stage, and
turned out to be the band, 1 knew
I was right in having formed no
preconceptions concerning the
play I was about to see. Moreover,
even if I had wanted to expect
something from the Magic Theatre
there was precious little to be told
from the title, Gorf, other than
that it was "frog" spelled
backwards, which really seemed
of no use at all.
Anyway, the basic plot of this
zany new work (musical?
comedy? farce?) by poet Michael
McClure now playing at the
Firehouse Theatre is
straightforward enough; it has to
do with the reassembling of the
particles of the Shitfer by a Giant
Penguin.
It also concerns the passing
away of Mert and Gert, who are
sat upon by a huge hairy elephant
just before the occurrence of the
Big Bump, in which time and
matter become scrunched.

The Prologue, or the Ur-Gorf
Drama, opens with Mert and Gert
sitting and reading newspapers —
the stereotyped blue-collar
couple, with Mert in a hardhat
and Gert ih purple curlers. They
are both noticeably lacking not
only blue collars but also all other
clothing. Their costumes consist
of a few scanty strips of shocking
pink synthetic fur — not at all
strategically placed.
The two exchange tales of
outrageous sexual adventures,
while sharing the stage with two
posturing characters, TV's One
and Two, who incessantly squeal
"How neat! How neat!" and hawk
Cruncheroos for breakfast fun.
Gorf Enters
Presently, Gorf appears in a
purple nylon outfit, wings,
stockings and patent leather
shoes. The audience learns that
he's being pursued by the
townspeople who blame him for
the deaths of Mert and Gert, who
have indeed been sat upon by the
aforementioned elephant.
To effect his escape, Gorf

assumes the guise of a woman,
Gorfetta, by donning a pink
neglige and pinning wigs to
various parts of his anatomy. His
costume, unfortunately, is so
convincing that it lures the three
hundred pound Blind Dyke, who,
it seems, has a large collection of
"cocks and balls stored in
vinegar."
All this should give a
sufficiently clear idea of what
goes on in Gorf, though no
account would be complete
without mentioning the naked
cutesy-pie chorus girls with
glittering stars dotting their pink
flesh, the attack on Gorf by an
octopus on Mount Olympus, the
confrontation between
motorcycle outlaws and the Blind
Dyke, or the curious chant, "Gorf
of all shall bring the God like to a
glowing gleam."
Gorf rolls and frolics and slides
towards its conclusion, which is
predictable, but that does not
matter. For it is the means by
which Gorf flows to an eventual
halt that make it delightful, and

that the viewer expects the end
does not detract from it but, if
possible, makes it more mellow.
Strangely enough, and
unbelievable as it may seem, there
is truly a method to this madness,
an organized structure to this
labyrinth of absurdity. The play
lets the audience in on its secret in
the closing moments, during the
crescendo of exultation that is the
finale. There are fireworks, and
three cheers for Gorf, and a
resounding chorus of "Reality is a
joke!"

As I filed out of the intimate
little theater, having the same
bemused, slightly vacant
expression as most of my
companions, I picked up a
crumpled, gaudy scrap of glitter
from the dusty floor — a single
star had become unglued from
one of the girls — and slipped it in
my pocket. I was bringing a bit of
fantasy back into the "real" world
— and I was going to have to write
about what I'd just seen. What
could I possibly say except . . .
experience Gorf, while you can.

I was right in having formed no
preconceptions concerning the
play I was about to see. Moreover,
even if I had wanted to expect
something from the Magic Theatre
there was precious little to be told
from the title, Gorf, other than
that it was "frog" spelled
backwards, which really seemed
of no use at all.
Anyway, the basic plot of this
zany new work (musical?
comedy? farce?) by poet Michael
McClure now playing at the
Firehouse Theatre is
straightforward enough; it has to
do with the reassembling of the
particles of the Shitfer by a Giant
Penguin.
It also concerns the passing
away of Mert and Gert, who are
sat upon by a huge hairy elephant
just before the occurrence of the
Big Bump, in which time and
matter become scrunched.

The Prologue, or the Ur-Gorf
Drama, opens with Mert and Gert
sitting and reading newspapers —
the stereotyped blue-collar
couple, with Mert in a hardhat
and Gert ih purple curlers. They
are both noticeably lacking not
only blue collars but also all other
clothing. Their costumes consist
of a few scanty strips of shocking
pink synthetic fur — not at all
strategically placed.
The two exchange tales of
outrageous sexual adventures,
while sharing the stage with two
posturing characters, TV's One
and Two, who incessantly squeal
"How neat! How neat!" and hawk
Cruncheroos for breakfast fun.
Gorf Enters
Presently, Gorf appears in a
purple nylon outfit, wings,
stockings and patent leather
shoes. The audience learns that
he's being pursued by the
townspeople who blame him for
the deaths of Mert and Gert, who
have indeed been sat upon by the
aforementioned elephant.
To effect his escape, Gorf

assumes the guise of a woman,
Gorfetta, by donning a pink
neglige and pinning wigs to
various parts of his anatomy. His
costume, unfortunately, is so
convincing that it lures the three
hundred pound Blind Dyke, who,
it seems, has a large collection of
"cocks and balls stored in
vinegar."
All this should give a
sufficiently clear idea of what
goes on in Gorf, though no
account would be complete
without mentioning the naked
cutesy-pie chorus girls with
glittering stars dotting their pink
flesh, the attack on Gorf by an
octopus on Mount Olympus, the
confrontation between
motorcycle outlaws and the Blind
Dyke, or the curious chant, "Gorf
of all shall bring the God like to a
glowing gleam."
Gorf rolls and frolics and slides
towards its conclusion, which is
predictable, but that does not
matter. For it is the means by
which Gorf flows to an eventual
halt that make it delightful, and

that the viewer expects the end
does not detract from it but, if
possible, makes it more mellow.
Strangely enough, and
unbelievable as it may seem, there
is truly a method to this madness,
an organized structure to this
labyrinth of absurdity. The play
lets the audience in on its secret in
the closing moments, during the
crescendo of exultation that is the
finale. There are fireworks, and
three cheers for Gorf, and a
resounding chorus of "Reality is a
joke!"

As I filed out of the intimate
little theater, having the same
bemused, slightly vacant
expression as most of my
companions, I picked up a
crumpled, gaudy scrap of glitter
from the dusty floor — a single
star had become unglued from
one of the girls — and slipped it in
my pocket. I was bringing a bit of
fantasy back into the "real" world
— and I was going to have to write
about what I'd just seen. What
could I possibly say except . . .
experience Gorf, while you can.
