# 'The Last Detail'
## Movie Explores Navy Mind 
### GEORGE POWELL 
offender (Randy Quaid) looks like
a typical unsophisticated teenager
who got caught doing the wrong
thing — in Quaid's case,
attempting to steal $40 from the
chapel, and consequently getting
10 years in the Marine detention
facility at Newport, Rhode Island.
The Navy gives the two ersatz
military policemen much more
time than necessary to get the
prisoner from Norfolk to
Newport, and so begins a long
journey that takes the three by
bus and train go Washington,
D.C., Philadelphia, New York,
Boston and finally the
destination.
In this mini-odyssey the two
career Navy men get to know the
young Quaid better, accept him as
a person and attempt to show him
a good time in his last few days of
freedom.
Accurate Reflection
If the journey sounds
mundane, it's only because the
film is such an accurate reflection
of military life. Although at first a
detestable detail, for two men
awaiting orders, it is a break from
the daily routine of hanging out
and waiting, and although
Nicholson and Young have some

Although Hollywood hasn't
released a war movie since 1970
( Kelley's Heroes), there is still a
wealth of filmable material
available about the military.
So cut out the big budget
hardware and concentrate on the
mind of the military man, and on
a person's struggles to cope with
the bureaucratic, paternalistic
military system.
Author Darryl Ponicsan has
done this in two books that have
been turned into new and
hopefully successful movies,
Cinderella Liberty, and The Imsl
Detail. Although Ponicsan didn't
write the screenplay for Detail, as
he did for Cinderella Liberty, the
former is a more compelling
picture of the effect the military
system has on essentially decent
people.
Two Sailors
The Last Detail finds two
sailors on casual status (awaiting
orders) who get stuck with the
unenviable task of escorting a
court-marsh ailed sailor to a
detention facility to begin his
sentence. Both are first class petty
officers, who have at least 12
years in the Navy. One (Jack
Nicholson) is white, one (Otis
Young) is black. The young

differences (Young calls it a
"chicken-shit" detail) they
obviously enjoy spending Navy
money showing the prisoner a
good time.
Nicholson's cocky
performance, dripping tough-guy
confidence, while wrapping his
insecurity in salty sailor's
language, is his finest since Easy
Rider. Young is perfect as the
voice of harsh reality, bringing
Nicholson back to the real
purpose of the group's travel.
But to really appreciate the
rough language, the crass, funny
behavior and rampant sexism of
sailors on the make, a moviegoer
would have had to have spent
some time in the military himself.
Nuance of the "lifer" fighting the
system that clothes, pays and
feeds him, while ultimately doing
its bidding are there, but masked
in the phony machismo bragging
that is a large part of enlisted
military life.
Even with no draft and no
worries about being forced into
such a system, the curious should
go to see some fine acting and
reflect on what they have had the
good fortune to miss.

Nicholson's cocky
performance, dripping tough-guy
confidence, while wrapping his
insecurity in salty sailor's
language, is his finest since Easy
Rider. Young is perfect as the
voice of harsh reality, bringing
Nicholson back to the real
purpose of the group's travel.
But to really appreciate the
rough language, the crass, funny
behavior and rampant sexism of
sailors on the make, a moviegoer
would have had to have spent
some time in the military himself.
Nuance of the "lifer" fighting the
system that clothes, pays and
feeds him, while ultimately doing
its bidding are there, but masked
in the phony machismo bragging
that is a large part of enlisted
military life.
Even with no draft and no
worries about being forced into
such a system, the curious should
go to see some fine acting and
reflect on what they have had the
good fortune to miss.
offender (Randy Quaid) looks like
a typical unsophisticated teenager
who got caught doing the wrong
thing — in Quaid's case,
attempting to steal $40 from the
chapel, and consequently getting
10 years in the Marine detention
facility at Newport, Rhode Island.
The Navy gives the two ersatz
military policemen much more
time than necessary to get the
prisoner from Norfolk to
Newport, and so begins a long
journey that takes the three by
bus and train go Washington,
D.C., Philadelphia, New York,
Boston and finally the
destination.
In this mini-odyssey the two
career Navy men get to know the
young Quaid better, accept him as
a person and attempt to show him
a good time in his last few days of
freedom.
Accurate Reflection
If the journey sounds
mundane, it's only because the
film is such an accurate reflection
of military life. Although at first a
detestable detail, for two men
awaiting orders, it is a break from
the daily routine of hanging out
and waiting, and although
Nicholson and Young have some

Although Hollywood hasn't
released a war movie since 1970
( Kelley's Heroes), there is still a
wealth of filmable material
available about the military.
So cut out the big budget
hardware and concentrate on the
mind of the military man, and on
a person's struggles to cope with
the bureaucratic, paternalistic
military system.
Author Darryl Ponicsan has
done this in two books that have
been turned into new and
hopefully successful movies,
Cinderella Liberty, and The Imsl
Detail. Although Ponicsan didn't
write the screenplay for Detail, as
he did for Cinderella Liberty, the
former is a more compelling
picture of the effect the military
system has on essentially decent
people.
Two Sailors
The Last Detail finds two
sailors on casual status (awaiting
orders) who get stuck with the
unenviable task of escorting a
court-marsh ailed sailor to a
detention facility to begin his
sentence. Both are first class petty
officers, who have at least 12
years in the Navy. One (Jack
Nicholson) is white, one (Otis
Young) is black. The young

differences (Young calls it a
"chicken-shit" detail) they
obviously enjoy spending Navy
money showing the prisoner a
good time.
