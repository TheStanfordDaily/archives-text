# Competition Grows Tougher
## Hargadon Explains Selection 
### BILL ROSS 
"Perhaps I ought to be called the
'Dean of Rejections,'" Fred
Hargadon, Dean of Admissions, told a
group of about 300 students at
Annenberg Auditorium last night.
Hargadon noted that 9300
applications were received for 1470
places in last year's freshman class.
"There's a lot more to the
admissions procedure than looking at
an applicant's folder and saying yes or
no," Hargadon remarked. A staff of
nine professionals work in the
admissions office and each application
is read by at least two or three of
them, he said. All applicants for
admission are rigorously studied by
the department.
Hargadon spoke on the topic
"Stanford Students: The Chosen Few"
as part of the "Everything You Always
Wanted To Know About Stanford"
lecture series.
Although academic factors are by
far the most important consideration
in examining an application,
extra-curricular activities and special
talents are also weighed, Hargadon
emphasized. But since 1500 applicants
each year have maintained straight
"A's" in high school, Stanford must
turn down many highly qualified
students.
Many Protest Rejections
"A lot of people write to us and
ask why we turned down the best
student in their town," Hargadon said.
"Well, there are a lot of towns in this
country."
Hargadon devoted a large portion
of his talk to correcting
misconceptions about the admissions
process, and to answering questions
from the audience.
Contrary to the belief of some
people, Stanford has never rejected an
applicant because he expressed a need
for financial aid, he declared.
Also, it is false that Stanford
gives special preference to potential

engineering students, he stated.
Stanford is the only University in the
nation that forces engineering
applicants to compete academically
with other applicants.
Transfer students must meet the
same academic standards as freshmen,
Hargadon stated. Competition among
transfer applicants is just as stiff as
among freshmen, and the percentage
of acceptance is no higher.
No Quotas <
There are no quotas for any
group, Hargadon explained, in answer
to a question from the audience.
It is not true that Stanford is
more provincial in the composition of
its student body than the Ivy League
universities, he said. Although
Stanford draws half of its students
from California, most leading eastern
universities make their selections from

an even more narrow geographic
region.
Hargadon said that thousands of
unsolicited letters of recommendations
are received each year on behalf of
applicants. A large share come from
U.S. congressmen. But the admissions
office pays little or no attention to
most such letters, he said.
Hargadon also noted that
interviews are of little consequence.
Interviews aren't required because
many students couldn't afford to visit
the University, and the inhibiting
atmosphere of such conferences tell
the interviewer little about the
applicant.
An ever increasing percentage ol
applicants are being rejected by
American universities, Hargadon
noted.

WHO GETS IN? — Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon discussed transfer and
freshman admissions last night in Annenburg Auditorium as part of the Stanford
lecture series, "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Stanford But
Didn't Know Whom To Ask." He said that children of alumni are not given
special consideration in the selection process unless all other factors are equal.
