# Mound Strength Questionable
## Cardinals Await Baseball Opener 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
WANTED: Two strong-armed
pitchers with plenty of experience
and lots of guts.
When Stanford head baseball
coach Ray Young looks at this
year's schedule, which includes 10
games against two of the top
teams in the nation (USC and
Arizona), that plea must linger in
his mind.
The Cardinals open a 49-game
season, which Young terms "the
toughest we've had in 14 years,"
with a doubleheader against
University of San Francisco
tomorrow. The first pitch is slated
for 12 noon at Sunken Diamond.
Young and his assistant Mark
Marquess, who coached the junior
varsity team last year, and
pitching coach Tom Dunton, have
10 lettermen back from last year's
team, which posted a 37-20
record overall and was 9-9 in the
Pacific Eight.
"Our outlook right now is one

of inexperience and youth," says
Young.
"At the moment we have a
starting lineup that is pretty set,"
said Young, who takes his team to
Arizona State for a three-game set
next weekend. However, he
pointed out that a lot of decisions
still have to be made.
Young Starters
Four sophomores, three juniors
and two seniors will comprise the
first nine tomorrow. All-Pac-8
Southern Division catcher Dave
Baker, who batted .348 as a
freshman last year, leads the
sophomore group. The other
starting sophs are centerfielder
Ray Anderson (.273), shortstop
Steve Davis (.309) and leftfielder
Bruce Robinson (.261).
The junior starters are last
year's All-District-8 selection Bob
Hampton (.393) in right field,
Gary Morton, who hit .417 for
varsity in limited duty when he
wasn't hitting .490 for the JV's, at
designated hitter (a new
innovation in the NCAA this year)
and righthanded pitcher A 1
Arthur, who was 7-2 last year.
Sophomore righthander Mike
Williamson is slated to start the
second game. Both pitchers are
allotted 50 to 60 pitches before
they will be relieved.
A battle between junior Joe
Lamoure and soph Gary Bei is
raging for the second base spot.
Both are about even in defensive
prowess, according to Young, but

Bei is a better lead-off hitter.
Seniors Mark Lucich (.280) at
first base and third baseman Kim
Hannaford (.253) round out the
lineup.
No Surgery For Frost
The inexperience of the
Cardinals is most apparent in the
pitching category. As of this
moment Arthur is the only
pitcher with any extensive varsity
experience who is ready to pitch.
Senior Dave Frost, who quit
basketball three weeks ago
because of knee problems, won't
be ready to throw for another
week, according to Young. Frost
has decided not to undergo knee
surgery, which would have
sidelined him for the year.
Sophomore righthander Ken
Grolle, who was a valuable part of
the Card rotation last year, will
not be able to pitch for an
indefinite period, according to
Young.
"Ken finished the season last
year with a sore arm, which kept
on hurting through the summer,"
says Young. "He has played
some catch but he can't throw
hard yet. He's under doctor's
orders right now."
Another pitcher who was
counted on heavily this year was
ace lefthander Bob DiPietro. But
he was drafted and signed by the
Pittsburgh Pirates two weeks ago.
The normal pitching limit for
the Cardinals is eight or nine.
Right now 13 pitchers are listed

among the 29-man squad.
Among the pitchers are three
freshman — lefthanders Jerry
Argust and John Yandle and
righthandler Jim Scharffenberger
— who Young wants to evaluate
early in the season.
Rounding out the pitching
corps are senior Max Goldstein,
junior college transfers Kent
Caldwell of Bakersfield and Dean
Stotz of Sacramento City College,
sophomores Bernie Hittner and
Bob Hiserodt and senior Randy
Whittell, who sat out last year
after pitching two years for the
JV's.
"We're considering this a 'building
year.' " Young says."The players
have worked extremely hard and
we intend to work them hard all
the way, trying to improve game
by game."
Has anyone seen a tall, lanky
lefthander throwing rocks around
campus lately?
