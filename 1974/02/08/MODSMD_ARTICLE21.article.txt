# Lieberman Puts Rugby In Perspective
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Lawry Lieberman will probably sleep well
tonight. His mind will most likely be
occupied with thoughts of his mid-term
exams in the Graduate School of Business
next week. Lieberman will begin to
contemplate tomorrow's rugby game against
the undefeated BATS only a few hours
before the 1:30 p.m. game time.
Lieberman, a first year business student,
has been an important addition to the
Stanford rugby team this year. Yet at the
beginning of the season coach Pete Kmetovic
had never seen Lieberman play. "Oh I heard
that there was a great rugby player from the
east in Business School, but this was just a
rumor." Lieberman went from rumor to
reality in the Stanford 10-a-side tournament.
"Lawry did a great job in the tournament,"
said Kmetovic.
Lieberman has played standoff this year, a
position that gives him the opportunity to
handle the ball a lot. He also handles the
kicking duties. Some of Lieberman's moves
resemble a football back, but he is quick to
point out that he is not a "6-3, 210 pound"
back. "My size [about 5-7] gives me the
incentive to run as fast as I do. Since I don't
care to get hit by all those big guys I find a
way to go around them. I like to lead the
breakaway."

Lieberman has had trouble making
penalty kicks this year but he thinks that it
may be due to a lack of practice. "My extra
points have been consistent, but I just can't
seem to make penalty kicks. This might hurt
the team."
Lieberman spent his undergraduate days
at Dartmouth, where he captained the rugby
team. Dartmouth won the Ivy League title
every year he played despite the fact that
rugby is a club sport at Dartmouth. "The
team at Dartmouth had great alumni support.
We got to take rugby trips to Ireland and the
Bahamas. The Bahama trip was a vacation,but
I really learned a lot of rugby in Ireland."
He chose rugby becuase he thought he was
ill-suited for football at the Ivy League
powerhouse. "Considering that Dartmouth
had just won its fifth Ivy League
championship, I didn't think I could have
added anything to the program." He enjoys
golf but he adds, "it can be an extremely
frustrating sport."
After graduating from Dartmouth he took
a year off, working for a San Francisco bank.
Later Lieberman and his wife Moira took a
three-month vacation in Mexico before
coming to Stanford. "The students here are
alive, active and aware. I really enjoy
Stanford," says Lieberman.

When he came here he wasn't planning to
play rugby. "The Business School is pretty
demanding, so I have to put some fairly rigid
constraints on my time. But Marty
[Odonohue] invited me to play on the
10-a-side team in December and I found that
I had the time to play."
Lieberman feels tha he is lucky to be able
to play rugby. "Rugby is the gentlemen's
game. There is intense competition, but
before the game you clap for your opponent
and after the game you get together for a few
beers."
Rugby is not the reason that Dick Enberg
and the TVS crew are in town, but
Lieberman likes it that way. "I enjoy the
pureness of rugby. If it were played up more
it would lose this."
Lieberman feels that west coast rugby is a
little bit better than its east coast cousin.
"The scrums out here are faster. There is
more emphasis on the scrum out here,"
Lieberman remarked.
Lieberman is attending Business School to
learn some "professional skills." But the
pressures of the business world probably will
not bother Lieberman's rugby performance.
He'll always sleep well, even before games
against undefeated foes.
