# Women Face Humboldt Basketballers
## 
### 
The women's varsity basketball
team flies to Humboldt tomorrow
in an attempt to avenge two years
of losses to Humboldt State.
Stanford faced the Lumberjills
with its junior varsity team in the
last two meetings beccause of
Humboldt's weak reputation. But
the Lumberjills "came on stronger
than we expected," according to
Stanford coach Shirley Schoof.
"This time our varsity should
make the competition more
even."
Ten players, manager Laurel
Treon and Schoof will make the
trip for the 10:30 a.m. game.
Schoof was glad the flight would
take 45 minutes, instead of
repeating the 20-hour round-trip
drive of the past two years.
Two JV players, guard Karen
Stromsmoe and forward Pat
Cornett, have been moved up the
varsity for the game.
Stanford's next home game is
against UC-Davis on Feb. 14.
