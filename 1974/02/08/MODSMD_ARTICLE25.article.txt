# Swimmers Prep For USC, UCLA
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
One of the world's more
quasi-conventional swim meets
takes place tomorrow at 2 p.m. at
the deGuerre pools as Stanford
faces the Los Altos Aquatic Club.
Although the meet's primary
Amotion will be to ready the
Cards for next weekend's meets
against USC and UCLA, there will
be some variations and deviations
in the art of dual meet
competition.
Two races not in the usual dual
meet program will be held so that
the swimmers can try to qualify
for the NCAA championships in
those events. Instead of the
1000-yard freestyle, the 1650 will
be swum. Steve Strong, Terry
Sutton, Ron Longinotti and Paul
Clark are the top Cards in that
listance. Replacing the 200 IM is
the 400 IM; another specialty of
Clark's.
Between races, Betsy Weeks'
women swimmers will take over
the pool. As coach of the
women's swim team, Weeks has
several swimmers hoping to
achieve the unusually high
standards demanded in order to
qualify for the women's nationals.
The best reason to come out to
the pools tomorrow (even better
than the free admission) may be
the respledent sunshine.< Unlike
last winter quarter when it seemed
iike the entire Pacific Ocean was
raining down on the Stanford
campus, this quarter's weather has
been more conducive to sun rays
and sun tans. Both have been in
abundant supply in the stands
above the pool.
While Coach Jim Gaughran's
swimmers have been working hard
lately, the results from last
weekend's meet with Santa Clara
exhibits the great shape that
they're in. Eleven swimmers
equaled or bettered their lifetime
bests. If this is any indication, a
well-rested squad next week in
Los Angeles should give the
Trojans and Bruins plenty of
trouble.
SWIMMING NOTES: One of
the nation's top high school
swimmers, Mike Bottom, is
visiting Stanford this weekend.
Bottom, younger brother of
USC's Joe Bottom, is from Santa
Clara. ... On the 15th and 16th,
while the varsity is in L.A., the
women will be hosting the
Stanford Women's Invitational at
the deGuerre pools.

GOLFERS MEET SAN JOSE STATE — Dave Baskins will be one of
the key performers this afternoon when Stanford's golf team travels
to San Jose Country Club for a 12:30 p.m. match against the
Spartans. Last weekend the Cards trounced SJS and four other
opponents in an 18-hole tournament as Aly Trompas shot 69, Baskins
and Conrad Nilmeier fired 73s and George Pettinger carded a 75.
