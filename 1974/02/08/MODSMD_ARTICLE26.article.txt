# Four Cards Drafted By New League

The fledgling World Football
League chose four more Stanford
players Wednesday as it
completed its first college football
draft.
Defensive back Randy Poltl,
center Bill Reid, running back
John Winesberry and backup
quarterback-punter Dave Ottmar
were the four new choices.
All-American signal-caller Mike
Boryla was drafted by New York
in the first round several weeks
ago.
Poltl was chosen by Hawaii in
the 19th round, Ottmar by Hawaii
in the 20th round, Reid by
Southern California in the 21st
round, and Winesberry by New
York in the 22nd round.
Winesberry was drafted as a wide
receiver, a position he hasn't
played since his sophomore year.
Earlier, in the NFL draft,
Minnesota selected Poltl, Los
Angeles drafted Ottmar, and
Denver picked Winesberry.
Defensive back James Ferguson
and kicker Rod Garcia, both
drafted by NFL teams, weren't
mentioned in the WFL draft.
Garcia has already indicated he'll
probably sign with Oakland of the
NFL, which may have had
something to do with the fact that
no WFL team drafted him.
