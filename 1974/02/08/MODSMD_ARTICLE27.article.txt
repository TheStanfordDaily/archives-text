# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
The Daily's fearless
forecaster approaches this
weekend's Pacific Eight games
with special anticipation. Not
only did his record skyrocket
to a moderately impressive
26-12 with a perfect 4-0
performance last weekend, but
this is the week Oregon finally
loses a Pac-8 game.
Eccentric Duck coach Dick
Harter may tell his players to
drain Bill Walton's knees at
mid-court or grab the program
out of John Wooden's hands,
but Harter's tricks just won't
work this week. The Ducks will
lose to the Bruins, and the
Daily predicts a second defeat
Friday night at the Sports
Arena in a game that may be

marred by the first genuine
brawl of the conference season.
Stanford should continue its
hot streak against Washingotn
and Washington State, but not
before the Huskies take the
Cards to the wire tonight.
California and Washington State
should play a heart-stopper
tonight, but the Bears will be
no match for improving
Washington tomorrow.
Stanford 78, Washington 76
California 65, WSU 64
UCLA 82, Oregon 51
USC 76, Oregon State 66
Stanford 80, WSU 63
Washington 81, Cat 67
UCLA 90, Oregon State 70
USC 79, Oregon 70
