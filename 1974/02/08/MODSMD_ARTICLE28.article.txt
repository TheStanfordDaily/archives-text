## Paper Loser 
### PETE BHATIA 
The saga of the Gavilan '72 cagers came to an end Wednesday as
they fell in their season's final outing 75-40 to the Lakers. However, it
was the closest Gavilan came to victory this season.
In the spirit of journalism this reporter ventured to Maples Pavilion
to find out more about this hearty Gavilan bunch. As it turned out, I
ended up playing for Gavilan and it was a unique, enjoyable
experience.
To say Gavilan is incompetent would be too cruel — unskilled
would be better. But despite a serious inability to dribble, Gavilan '72
is a fine group of people out to have a little fun on the court. They
came, they played and they lost — but they had a good time.
Looking at the game, one was amazed by the so-called Lakers.
Frankly, any decent sixth grade team could have beaten them by 30
points. The only reason the Lakers upset Gavilan was that all five of
their players converged and stole the ball any time a female Gavilan
player had it.
Leading scorer for the Lakers was Bill "The Hack" Thacker with
38. The leading Gavilan scorer had 18. His name has not been released
to the press, but he is rumored to be the diminutive author of this
article.

Gavilan stars Dean "The
Dream" Hashimoto and Linda
"Stretch" Budson were held to
two points apiece. Carl "The
Banana" Ho added six and Skip
"Springs" Rung eight for Gavilan.
After the game, Gavilan's
player-coach Hasimoto inferred
Gavilan would meet "The
Streakers" at halftime of the
Stanford-UCLA game here March
2nd. The Stanford athletic
department had no comment.
In other games, Biz II A came
from behind in the waning
minutes to topple the undefeated
Mighty Mites 51-50. The win
upped Biz ll's record to 3-0 and
insured them a playoff berth.
Colin Munday led Biz with 18 and
Dave Carver added 13. Hall led
the Mites with 14.
Jacks or Better continued its
winning ways, despite their name,
with a 46-28 romp over the
Zensefers. Bill "Boom-Boom"
Whiting had 28 and team mascot
Buzz Burr added five.
Macismo knocked the Zetes
out of the undefeated ranks with
an exciting 46-45 victory. The win
ran Machsimo's record to 3-0.
Former JV player Kevin Enright
led the towering Machismo front
line with 16 points. Jimmy Johns
added 14 and Mike Henehan
chipped in nine. Craig Johnson led
the Zete attack with 23 points.
In two other battles of
undefeateds the Dekes toppled
Biz I A 1 53-50. Bob Brain led the
Dekes with 22 and Mike
added 12.
The Phi Delts edged the
Culos, 61-45, taking advantage of
some awesome offensive
rebounding.

the Mites with 14.
Jacks or Better continued its
winning ways, despite their name,
with a 46-28 romp over the
Zensefers. Bill "Boom-Boom"
Whiting had 28 and team mascot
Buzz Burr added five.
Macismo knocked the Zetes
out of the undefeated ranks with
an exciting 46-45 victory. The win
ran Machsimo's record to 3-0.
Former JV player Kevin Enright
led the towering Machismo front
line with 16 points. Jimmy Johns
added 14 and Mike Henehan
chipped in nine. Craig Johnson led
the Zete attack with 23 points.
In two other battles of
undefeateds the Dekes toppled
Biz I A 1 53-50. Bob Brain led the
Dekes with 22 and Mike
added 12.
The Phi Delts edged the
Culos, 61-45, taking advantage of
some awesome offensive
rebounding.
The saga of the Gavilan '72 cagers came to an end Wednesday as
they fell in their season's final outing 75-40 to the Lakers. However, it
was the closest Gavilan came to victory this season.
In the spirit of journalism this reporter ventured to Maples Pavilion
to find out more about this hearty Gavilan bunch. As it turned out, I
ended up playing for Gavilan and it was a unique, enjoyable
experience.
To say Gavilan is incompetent would be too cruel — unskilled
would be better. But despite a serious inability to dribble, Gavilan '72
is a fine group of people out to have a little fun on the court. They
came, they played and they lost — but they had a good time.
Looking at the game, one was amazed by the so-called Lakers.
Frankly, any decent sixth grade team could have beaten them by 30
points. The only reason the Lakers upset Gavilan was that all five of
their players converged and stole the ball any time a female Gavilan
player had it.
Leading scorer for the Lakers was Bill "The Hack" Thacker with
38. The leading Gavilan scorer had 18. His name has not been released
to the press, but he is rumored to be the diminutive author of this
article.

Gavilan stars Dean "The
Dream" Hashimoto and Linda
"Stretch" Budson were held to
two points apiece. Carl "The
Banana" Ho added six and Skip
"Springs" Rung eight for Gavilan.
After the game, Gavilan's
player-coach Hasimoto inferred
Gavilan would meet "The
Streakers" at halftime of the
Stanford-UCLA game here March
2nd. The Stanford athletic
department had no comment.
In other games, Biz II A came
from behind in the waning
minutes to topple the undefeated
Mighty Mites 51-50. The win
upped Biz ll's record to 3-0 and
insured them a playoff berth.
Colin Munday led Biz with 18 and
Dave Carver added 13. Hall led
the Mites with 14.
