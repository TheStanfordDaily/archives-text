# Guessing Games At Maples
## Cards Host Huskies, Cougars 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford basketball fans may
be treated to one outstanding
performance and one very poor
showing this weekend when
Washington and Washington State
invade Maples Pavilion. And the
Stanford Cardinals may be
responsible for both.
The unpredictable Cardinals
have kept the gamblers guessing
and head coach Howie Dallmar
scratching his head this season.
The Cards have posted convincing
wins the past two weekends,
trouncing Denver 108-62 two
weeks ago and thrashing Cal 71-53
last weekend. The win over
Denver snapped a dismal six-game
losing streak.
"I have to say that these kids
have worked awfully hard and
struggled through some difficult
times," said Dallmar, "and it's
nice to see it paying off with the
kind of success we have enjoyed
the past couple of weeks."
It has seemed all too easy the
past two games, as the Cards have
finally begun to control the
boards and establish a fast break
attack on the strength of guards
Melvin Arterberry and Jim
Montague.
WSU coach George "The
Rave" Raveling is wary of the
Cards' recent successes. "We may
be meeting Stanford at the wrong
time," he said."They seem to have
gotten things together and are
playing the way people thought
they would at the start of the
season."
Improvement
At that time Stanford was
picked to challenge for second
place in the Pac-8. Now 1-4, with
a long road trip to the Northwest
ahead of them, the Cardinals will
have to struggle to finish with a
winning season. But with the
improvement the Cards have
shown recently, especially at the
guard spots, coach Dallmar
remains optimistic.
"This is our chance to get back
in the race and make up for some
of our earlier disappointments,
and I just hope the momentum
will continue."
Stanford faces the Huskies
tonight, who have some
momentum of their own going
after a 90-77 win over WSU last
weekend. Like the Cards,
Washington is enduring a long
conference season with a 1-4
record, tying them with Stanford

and Cal for last place. Washington
is 10-7 overall.
The Huskies are second in the
conference in scoring with an
average of 73 per game, but are
giving up an embarrassing 88
points per contest. Pacing the
Huskies' attack are forwards Ray
Price (15.6) and Larry Pounds
(16.1), and sophomore guard
Clarence Ramsey (16.6).
Price Hot
Price scored 29 points and
grabbed 13 rebounds in the win
over WSU last week, but it was
the performance of center Lars
Hansen which may have more
effect on Stanford's chances of
winning this weekend. It was
Hansen who clubbed the Pac-B's
leading scorer, WSU center Steve
Puidokas, fracturing his
cheekbone and opening a cut
under the left eye. The injury was
described as "minor," but
Puidokas underwent surgery
yesterday and won't play against
Stanford and Cal this weekend.
"One thing Steve and I want to
make clear," said Raveling, "is in
no way do we feel it was a
deliberate thing." Junior Rich
Steele will probably replace

Puidokas, but Raveling may go
with sophomore transfer Norton
Barnhill.
"I had planned to use Barnhill
in reserve roles and break him in
slowly," Raveling said, but
indicated that Barnhill may now
be forced to assume a starting
role.
Joining either Steele or
Barnhill in the starting lineup will
be senior point man Brad Jackson

(5.7), junior wingman Edgar
Jeffries (13.4), wingman Sammy
Miller (13.1) and freshman Greg
Johnson (3.3).
Stanford will counter with
Montague, Arterberry, Rich
Kelley, Tim Patterson and Ed
Schweitzer.
The Washington State game
will be televised live tomorrow
afternoon at 3 p.m. on KTVU
Channel 2.

Stanford will counter with
Montague, Arterberry, Rich

Schweitzer.

Channel 2.
Stanford basketball fans may
be treated to one outstanding
performance and one very poor
showing this weekend when
Washington and Washington State
invade Maples Pavilion. And the
Stanford Cardinals may be
responsible for both.
The unpredictable Cardinals
have kept the gamblers guessing
and head coach Howie Dallmar
scratching his head this season.
The Cards have posted convincing
wins the past two weekends,
trouncing Denver 108-62 two
weeks ago and thrashing Cal 71-53
last weekend. The win over
Denver snapped a dismal six-game
losing streak.
"I have to say that these kids
have worked awfully hard and
struggled through some difficult
times," said Dallmar, "and it's
nice to see it paying off with the
kind of success we have enjoyed
the past couple of weeks."
It has seemed all too easy the
past two games, as the Cards have
finally begun to control the
boards and establish a fast break
attack on the strength of guards
Melvin Arterberry and Jim
Montague.
WSU coach George "The
Rave" Raveling is wary of the
Cards' recent successes. "We may
be meeting Stanford at the wrong
time," he said."They seem to have
gotten things together and are
playing the way people thought
they would at the start of the
season."
Improvement
At that time Stanford was
picked to challenge for second
place in the Pac-8. Now 1-4, with
a long road trip to the Northwest
ahead of them, the Cardinals will
have to struggle to finish with a
winning season. But with the
improvement the Cards have
shown recently, especially at the
guard spots, coach Dallmar
remains optimistic.
"This is our chance to get back
in the race and make up for some
of our earlier disappointments,
and I just hope the momentum
will continue."
Stanford faces the Huskies
tonight, who have some
momentum of their own going
after a 90-77 win over WSU last
weekend. Like the Cards,
Washington is enduring a long
conference season with a 1-4
record, tying them with Stanford

and Cal for last place. Washington
is 10-7 overall.
The Huskies are second in the
conference in scoring with an
average of 73 per game, but are
giving up an embarrassing 88
points per contest. Pacing the
Huskies' attack are forwards Ray
Price (15.6) and Larry Pounds
(16.1), and sophomore guard
Clarence Ramsey (16.6).
Price Hot
Price scored 29 points and
grabbed 13 rebounds in the win
over WSU last week, but it was
the performance of center Lars
Hansen which may have more
effect on Stanford's chances of
winning this weekend. It was
Hansen who clubbed the Pac-B's
leading scorer, WSU center Steve
Puidokas, fracturing his
cheekbone and opening a cut
under the left eye. The injury was
described as "minor," but
Puidokas underwent surgery
yesterday and won't play against
Stanford and Cal this weekend.
"One thing Steve and I want to
make clear," said Raveling, "is in
no way do we feel it was a
deliberate thing." Junior Rich
Steele will probably replace

Puidokas, but Raveling may go
with sophomore transfer Norton
Barnhill.
"I had planned to use Barnhill
in reserve roles and break him in
slowly," Raveling said, but
indicated that Barnhill may now
be forced to assume a starting
role.
Joining either Steele or
Barnhill in the starting lineup will
be senior point man Brad Jackson

(5.7), junior wingman Edgar
Jeffries (13.4), wingman Sammy
Miller (13.1) and freshman Greg
Johnson (3.3).
