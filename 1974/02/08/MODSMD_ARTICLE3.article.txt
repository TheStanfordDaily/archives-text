# Dement Explains Sleep Patterns, Discusses Popular Misconceptions

"It is amazing how unfamiliar
people are about their own sleep and
how many misconceptions they have,"
Dr. William C. Dement, professor of
psychiatry, said Wednesday night in a
speech at Memorial Auditorium.
Lecturing before about 800
people on "sleep, what can go wrong
with it and what you can do when that
happens," Dement defined sleep as "a
transition in which all of the apparatus
of the mind shuts down. Most people
experience sleep as a single thing,"
Dement added. "If you're lucky it's a
time of oblivion."
Sleep, however, is not singular
but consists of two states which
alternate during the night and "are as
different from each other as both are

from wakefulness," Dement explained.
One state, rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep, was discovered in 1952
by Dement's former teacher, Dr.
Nathaniel Kleitman. Dement described
REM sleep as "an awake brain in a
paralyzed body (with the brain)
preoccupied with its own internally
generative world."
Dream Sleep
During REM sleep, while the eyes
are constantly shifting, the sleeper is
dreaming, Dement said. Somewhere in
the brain a generator stimulates the
entire brain and causes "the cerebral
turbulance which characterizes REM
sleep," Dement stated.
At this time the motor discharge
of the brain can be so intense that it
breaks through the paralyzed nervous

system and causes twitching, according
to Dement. To illustrate the point, the
psychiatrist showed films of baby
mammals such as cats and monkeys
twitching spasmodically in their sleep.
Dement described non-REM sleep
as a state in which the brain is at its
"lowest ebb of activity" and the body
is not paralyzed. Generally there is no
dreaming during non-REM sleep, and
if someone awakes from this state he is
not likely to remember his dreaming
periods, Dement said.
Because the REM periods
lengthen with the night, there is a 50
percent chance of remembering a
dream in the morning.
Turning to the matter of how
much sleep is enough, the director of
