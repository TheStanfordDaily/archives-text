# JV's Face Contrasting Foes

### TIM FERGUSON 
Riding a hot streak which its coach credits to
"hustle and hard work," the junior varsity cage
team hosts two very different opponents tonight
and tomorrow afternoon at Maples.
North Peralta Community College should prove
a demanding test for Stanford tonight, according to
Card coach Billy Jones. "Position for position,
they're quicker than we are," says Jones. "We'll
just have to rely on team defense. Quickness [of
opponents] has given us a problem so far this year
— more so than size."
Jones says Peralta is above .500 for the season
but lacks tremendous size. (Actually, starters Mike
Smith and Tadpole Talton are 6-6 and 6-5,
respectively.) Apparently Stanford center Scott
Russell (6-8) should have dominant height, but
Jones is dubious: "If 6-2, 6-3 players can jump out
of the gym, it [height advantage] doesn't make any
difference."
On Saturday, the Cards will entertain a "club
team" from UC-Santa Cruz, always known for the
unusual.
"Contrary to popular belief, we do have a
team," stated an employee of Santa Cruz physical
education office Tuesday.
Later checks showed that the team not only
exists, but has a 7-3 record (with opponents such as
the California Maritime Academy and the Defense
Language Institute, however). Santa Cruz did lead
the San Jose State JV, which beat Stanford, at

halftime before losing, 80-61, and lost respectively
to Gavilan, 74-71, Stanford defeated Gavilan,
70-61.
As a club team, Santa Cruz "can play anybody
... grad students, anybody," says Jones. "We don't
know who they have. But we gotta have respect for
them — they're not pushovers."
According to Santa Cruz club advisor Terry
Warner, this year's UCSC squad is "playing better
ball than last year's group," which lost to Stanford,
89-43. Warner lists 6-1 guard Jeff Sharf as
player-coach, and 6-7 junior Dave Krasowski as the
tallest Santa Cruzian.
Warner expects a tighter game with Stanford this
season, and says,"I hope they've gotten rid of
some of those seven-footers."
In that respect, Santa Cruz is in luck, but it may
have scheduled the Cards at an inopportune time.
Now 5-5, Stanford is fresh off a big 82-68 win over
California.
"When you work hard, things happen," says
Jones of his team's success. "You make your
breaks. We haven't shot that well. We've just had
great hustle on loose balls, and Scott [Russell] has
been rebounding we 11...."
Mike Bowen will return to the starting lineup in
place of Terry McCartin, who missed practice until
Wednesday with an illness. Wing Sven Walker will
again draw a starting assignment, assuring a noisy
contingent of "Sven's Men" in the stands. '
