# Archie, Pieman And Wally
## Meet The Cardinal Bomb Squad 
### PETE BHATIA 
The game is rapidly drawing to a close. There are three
minutes to play. The players on the court are dragging. It's
time for Stanford coach Howie Dallmar to substitute. He
looks down his bench and selects three fresh players.
After a few words of encouragement from him they
come on the floor. Amazingly, they combine for 17 points
and eight rebounds in those three short minutes. The
crowd comes to its feet in response to spinning drives,
25-foot jump shots, and rim-high leaps. In their short
tenure in the game, they wrap up a needed Card victory.
Who are these superstars coming in to seal the win? Are
they Kelley, Patterson and Schweitzer? Or is it some secret
weapon Dallmar hasn't revealed to us?
Well, .. . it's neither. These three late arrivals in the
Stanford-Denver game described above are non other than
Arch, Pieman and Wally.
They are the " Bomb Squad." They are the 10th, 11th
and 12th players on a 12-man team. They are Archie
Dean, Mike Simons and Rich Wohlstadter.
In a normal game, Dallmar uses nine players
interchangeably. The other three, Dean, Simons and
Wohlstadter, only play when the Cards have sewed up a
victory or have been totally blown off the court.
Crowd Pleasers
Yet, when they play, the Stanford crowd comes to life.
Undoubtedly the fan can recall his days on the bench and
can identify with the "bombers." The "bombers"
themselves offer contrasting styles and attitudes towards
the game. You will meet them alphabetically so none of
them will get upset and not give the others the ball this
weekend.
Archie Dean is a 6-3 junior. He averaged 1.2
points-per-game last year after averaging 10.4 a game on
the freshman team. This year he averages 1.2 and is seeing
considerably more action.
Dean was heavily recruited on the east coast after he
graduated from Rutherford (New Jersey) High. He came
to Stanford to play "Big time Pac-8 ball" and because he
felt the Farm offered him the best opportunity athletically
and academically.
He sees himself as a good player whose full potential
hasn't been recognized by the Card coaching staff. Dean is
frank when he says his basketball fortunes have been "very
disappointing." He says,"I think I should be playing
more. I'm not being given a fair shake. It hurts to be on
the bench and I know I have the ability to start here."
Dean rejects the role many bench-ridden players
assume. "It's hard to be a cheerleader when I know I
should be playing. Sure I'll cheer someone who makes a
good play but its hard to be cheering when I'm here [on
the bench] instead of playing."
Two Choices
Dean has developed quite a reputation as a "bomber"
in his two years on the varsity. But he puts little stake in
it.
"I resent the term 'bomb squader.' I think I'm a good
shot . . . and its difficult when I get in. I don't know what
you should do. You can show the people what you can do
or run the offense for the coaches."
But, he said smiling, "I don't pass up an open shot
when I have one."
As with all bench players, Dean has entertained
thoughts of quitting. However, he says, "Quitting is the
last thing I'll do." As with Simons and Wohlstadter, his
love for the game overcomes his futility on the bench.

Mike Simons is a 6-4 junior who has two more years of
eligibility remaining after redshirting last season. He
averaged 8.8 points per game as a frosh and is currently
scoring 2.8 points-an-outing.
Out of McLean (Virginia) High School, where he was
All-State and All-Metropolitan Washington D.C., Simons
was approached by over 100 schools. Stanford, however,
was the only West Coast school and he chose it for the
climate, the academics and the athletics.
He laughingly says,"I thought I would play here
immediately, but that didn't turn out to be the case."
Three Good Years
He didn't expect to be redshirted but he liked the idea
because it made the academics a little easier. Plus,
"(Stanford assistant coach ] Bub Bowling told me it would
give me three good years instead of two."
Like Dean, Simons feels he deserves a better chance. "I
don't feel I've been given the opportunity some others
have. I don't believe I've gotten a decent shot from my
frosh year on. The coaches don't give me enough credit for
my strengths."
His strengths are mainly his shooting ability. He is the
Cards' best outside shooter and is accurate up to 30 feet.
He also lays claim to the title of "The Nation's Leading
Free Throw Shooter." He is currently 4-4 on the season
from the charity stripe.
Simons is disappointed he hasn't been used in certain
situations, particularly against zones where his outside
touch could prove devastating. He cites this season's
Colorado State and Oregon State games as particular

examples.
"When I do get to play," Simons says, "I'm not
consciously thinking anything. .. . I'm nervous and
excited ... thinking what I should do." And he is exciting
to watch. Against Denver he hit four consecutive
20-foot-plus jumpers which electrified the crowd.
The Simons jump shot is "automatic. My mind is clear
when I'm shooting. If a shot is a good one depends on the
situation. I'd never shoot the bombs I did against Denver if
we had a small lead."
'Haven't Peaked Yet'
Simons, known as Pieman, and as "the Bear" for a Bear
Bryant-like hat he frequently wears (Bowling says it makes
him look like Pinochio), sees Stanford's best games ahead.
"We haven't even peaked yet," he says.
Rich Wohlstadter is a 6-4 sophomore who averaged 8.9
points per-game last year on JV and in his short varsity
tenure is scoring 0.7 points per game. He started the
season as the varsity's 13th man, but moved up with the
departure of Dave Frost.
He was only semi-recruited out of Los Angeles'
University High and is not on scholarship. He is a very
talented shooter and a spectacular jumper.
On the bench Wohlstadter says "I'm not thinking . ..
I'm just hoping for a win. I know I'm not going in but its
no fun to be a loser and be on the bench.
"It doesn't bother me that I'm not playing because I
haven't shown enough in practice. I'm content for now
until I can prove my ability to myself and the coaches."
Wohlstadter approves of his cheerleader role. At one
point against UCLA he flew off the bench screaming and it
looked like he was going to deck referee Ernie Filiberti. He
says, "It's good to be a cheerleader from the bench. If you
don't say something you're more likely to get upset."
Wohlstadter, whom teammate Ed Schweitzer
affectionally calls "The Idiot," is a very mild-mannered,
always smiling, and soft-spoken individual.
Embarrassing Debut
He reluctantly tells the story of what happened in his
first varsity appearance.
It happened on Monday night, Jan. 21 at Air Force.
The Cards were being demolished by the smaller
"Zoomies," as the Cards called them, and there was about
three minutes to go.
"I never thought I'd get in. I guess when you're losing
you don't think about it. And the coach was probably too
upset to think about the bench.
"Then he [Dallmar] called me to go in. I hadn't taken
off my sweats because I didn't think I'd get in and when
Ed [Schweitzer] fouled out the coach called me and I
couldn't believe it.
"I ripped off my top and ran to the scorer. Since Ed
had fouled out I didn't think I needed to talk to the
coach.
"I took a few steps on the court and all the Zoomies
erupted laughing. I think it was the ref that motioned to
my legs and I looked down and those sweats were as red as
my face."
Smiling, laughing and shaking his head, Wohlstadter
continued, "It was the most embarrasing moment of my
life. I looked up and coach Dallmar was grinning from
ear-to-ear. Well, at least he had something to smile about."
Now, Wohlstadter laughs about the incident and says,
"It gives the team something to talk about. They tell me
they were all screaming and yelling at me, but I was so
amazed to get in, I guess I didn't hear them."

tenure is scoring 0.7 points per game. He started the
season as the varsity's 13th man, but moved up with the
departure of Dave Frost.
He was only semi-recruited out of Los Angeles'
University High and is not on scholarship. He is a very
talented shooter and a spectacular jumper.
On the bench Wohlstadter says "I'm not thinking . ..
I'm just hoping for a win. I know I'm not going in but its
no fun to be a loser and be on the bench.
"It doesn't bother me that I'm not playing because I
haven't shown enough in practice. I'm content for now
until I can prove my ability to myself and the coaches."
Wohlstadter approves of his cheerleader role. At one
point against UCLA he flew off the bench screaming and it
looked like he was going to deck referee Ernie Filiberti. He
says, "It's good to be a cheerleader from the bench. If you
don't say something you're more likely to get upset."
Wohlstadter, whom teammate Ed Schweitzer
affectionally calls "The Idiot," is a very mild-mannered,
always smiling, and soft-spoken individual.
Embarrassing Debut
He reluctantly tells the story of what happened in his
first varsity appearance.
It happened on Monday night, Jan. 21 at Air Force.
The Cards were being demolished by the smaller
"Zoomies," as the Cards called them, and there was about
three minutes to go.
"I never thought I'd get in. I guess when you're losing
you don't think about it. And the coach was probably too
upset to think about the bench.
"Then he [Dallmar] called me to go in. I hadn't taken
off my sweats because I didn't think I'd get in and when
Ed [Schweitzer] fouled out the coach called me and I
couldn't believe it.
"I ripped off my top and ran to the scorer. Since Ed
had fouled out I didn't think I needed to talk to the
coach.
"I took a few steps on the court and all the Zoomies
erupted laughing. I think it was the ref that motioned to
my legs and I looked down and those sweats were as red as
my face."
Smiling, laughing and shaking his head, Wohlstadter
continued, "It was the most embarrasing moment of my
life. I looked up and coach Dallmar was grinning from
ear-to-ear. Well, at least he had something to smile about."
Now, Wohlstadter laughs about the incident and says,
"It gives the team something to talk about. They tell me
they were all screaming and yelling at me, but I was so
amazed to get in, I guess I didn't hear them."

Pieman (45) and Arch Battle for a Rebound
The game is rapidly drawing to a close. There are three
minutes to play. The players on the court are dragging. It's
time for Stanford coach Howie Dallmar to substitute. He
looks down his bench and selects three fresh players.
After a few words of encouragement from him they
come on the floor. Amazingly, they combine for 17 points
and eight rebounds in those three short minutes. The
crowd comes to its feet in response to spinning drives,
25-foot jump shots, and rim-high leaps. In their short
tenure in the game, they wrap up a needed Card victory.
Who are these superstars coming in to seal the win? Are
they Kelley, Patterson and Schweitzer? Or is it some secret
weapon Dallmar hasn't revealed to us?
Well, .. . it's neither. These three late arrivals in the
Stanford-Denver game described above are non other than
Arch, Pieman and Wally.
They are the " Bomb Squad." They are the 10th, 11th
and 12th players on a 12-man team. They are Archie
Dean, Mike Simons and Rich Wohlstadter.
In a normal game, Dallmar uses nine players
interchangeably. The other three, Dean, Simons and
Wohlstadter, only play when the Cards have sewed up a
victory or have been totally blown off the court.
Crowd Pleasers
Yet, when they play, the Stanford crowd comes to life.
Undoubtedly the fan can recall his days on the bench and
can identify with the "bombers." The "bombers"
themselves offer contrasting styles and attitudes towards
the game. You will meet them alphabetically so none of
them will get upset and not give the others the ball this
weekend.
Archie Dean is a 6-3 junior. He averaged 1.2
points-per-game last year after averaging 10.4 a game on
the freshman team. This year he averages 1.2 and is seeing
considerably more action.
Dean was heavily recruited on the east coast after he
graduated from Rutherford (New Jersey) High. He came
to Stanford to play "Big time Pac-8 ball" and because he
felt the Farm offered him the best opportunity athletically
and academically.
He sees himself as a good player whose full potential
hasn't been recognized by the Card coaching staff. Dean is
frank when he says his basketball fortunes have been "very
disappointing." He says,"I think I should be playing
more. I'm not being given a fair shake. It hurts to be on
the bench and I know I have the ability to start here."
Dean rejects the role many bench-ridden players
assume. "It's hard to be a cheerleader when I know I
should be playing. Sure I'll cheer someone who makes a
good play but its hard to be cheering when I'm here [on
the bench] instead of playing."
Two Choices
Dean has developed quite a reputation as a "bomber"
in his two years on the varsity. But he puts little stake in
it.
"I resent the term 'bomb squader.' I think I'm a good
shot . . . and its difficult when I get in. I don't know what
you should do. You can show the people what you can do
or run the offense for the coaches."
But, he said smiling, "I don't pass up an open shot
when I have one."
As with all bench players, Dean has entertained
thoughts of quitting. However, he says, "Quitting is the
last thing I'll do." As with Simons and Wohlstadter, his
love for the game overcomes his futility on the bench.

Mike Simons is a 6-4 junior who has two more years of
eligibility remaining after redshirting last season. He
averaged 8.8 points per game as a frosh and is currently
scoring 2.8 points-an-outing.
Out of McLean (Virginia) High School, where he was
All-State and All-Metropolitan Washington D.C., Simons
was approached by over 100 schools. Stanford, however,
was the only West Coast school and he chose it for the
climate, the academics and the athletics.
He laughingly says,"I thought I would play here
immediately, but that didn't turn out to be the case."
Three Good Years
He didn't expect to be redshirted but he liked the idea
because it made the academics a little easier. Plus,
"(Stanford assistant coach ] Bub Bowling told me it would
give me three good years instead of two."
Like Dean, Simons feels he deserves a better chance. "I
don't feel I've been given the opportunity some others
have. I don't believe I've gotten a decent shot from my
frosh year on. The coaches don't give me enough credit for
my strengths."
His strengths are mainly his shooting ability. He is the
Cards' best outside shooter and is accurate up to 30 feet.
He also lays claim to the title of "The Nation's Leading
Free Throw Shooter." He is currently 4-4 on the season
from the charity stripe.
Simons is disappointed he hasn't been used in certain
situations, particularly against zones where his outside
touch could prove devastating. He cites this season's
Colorado State and Oregon State games as particular

examples.
"When I do get to play," Simons says, "I'm not
consciously thinking anything. .. . I'm nervous and
excited ... thinking what I should do." And he is exciting
to watch. Against Denver he hit four consecutive
20-foot-plus jumpers which electrified the crowd.
The Simons jump shot is "automatic. My mind is clear
when I'm shooting. If a shot is a good one depends on the
situation. I'd never shoot the bombs I did against Denver if
we had a small lead."
'Haven't Peaked Yet'
Simons, known as Pieman, and as "the Bear" for a Bear
Bryant-like hat he frequently wears (Bowling says it makes
him look like Pinochio), sees Stanford's best games ahead.
"We haven't even peaked yet," he says.
Rich Wohlstadter is a 6-4 sophomore who averaged 8.9
points per-game last year on JV and in his short varsity
tenure is scoring 0.7 points per game. He started the
season as the varsity's 13th man, but moved up with the

But, he said smiling, "I don't pass up an open shot
when I have one."
As with all bench players, Dean has entertained
thoughts of quitting. However, he says, "Quitting is the
last thing I'll do." As with Simons and Wohlstadter, his
love for the game overcomes his futility on the bench.

Mike Simons is a 6-4 junior who has two more years of
eligibility remaining after redshirting last season. He
averaged 8.8 points per game as a frosh and is currently
scoring 2.8 points-an-outing.
Out of McLean (Virginia) High School, where he was
All-State and All-Metropolitan Washington D.C., Simons
was approached by over 100 schools. Stanford, however,
was the only West Coast school and he chose it for the
climate, the academics and the athletics.
He laughingly says,"I thought I would play here
immediately, but that didn't turn out to be the case."
Three Good Years
He didn't expect to be redshirted but he liked the idea
because it made the academics a little easier. Plus,
"(Stanford assistant coach ] Bub Bowling told me it would
give me three good years instead of two."
Like Dean, Simons feels he deserves a better chance. "I
don't feel I've been given the opportunity some others
have. I don't believe I've gotten a decent shot from my
frosh year on. The coaches don't give me enough credit for
my strengths."
His strengths are mainly his shooting ability. He is the
Cards' best outside shooter and is accurate up to 30 feet.
He also lays claim to the title of "The Nation's Leading
Free Throw Shooter." He is currently 4-4 on the season
from the charity stripe.
Simons is disappointed he hasn't been used in certain
situations, particularly against zones where his outside
touch could prove devastating. He cites this season's
Colorado State and Oregon State games as particular

examples.
"When I do get to play," Simons says, "I'm not
consciously thinking anything. .. . I'm nervous and
excited ... thinking what I should do." And he is exciting
to watch. Against Denver he hit four consecutive
20-foot-plus jumpers which electrified the crowd.
The Simons jump shot is "automatic. My mind is clear
when I'm shooting. If a shot is a good one depends on the
situation. I'd never shoot the bombs I did against Denver if
we had a small lead."
'Haven't Peaked Yet'
Simons, known as Pieman, and as "the Bear" for a Bear
Bryant-like hat he frequently wears (Bowling says it makes
him look like Pinochio), sees Stanford's best games ahead.
"We haven't even peaked yet," he says.
Rich Wohlstadter is a 6-4 sophomore who averaged 8.9
points per-game last year on JV and in his short varsity
tenure is scoring 0.7 points per game. He started the
season as the varsity's 13th man, but moved up with the
departure of Dave Frost.
He was only semi-recruited out of Los Angeles'
University High and is not on scholarship. He is a very
talented shooter and a spectacular jumper.
On the bench Wohlstadter says "I'm not thinking . ..
I'm just hoping for a win. I know I'm not going in but its
no fun to be a loser and be on the bench.
"It doesn't bother me that I'm not playing because I
haven't shown enough in practice. I'm content for now
until I can prove my ability to myself and the coaches."
Wohlstadter approves of his cheerleader role. At one
point against UCLA he flew off the bench screaming and it
looked like he was going to deck referee Ernie Filiberti. He
says, "It's good to be a cheerleader from the bench. If you
don't say something you're more likely to get upset."
Wohlstadter, whom teammate Ed Schweitzer
affectionally calls "The Idiot," is a very mild-mannered,
always smiling, and soft-spoken individual.
Embarrassing Debut
He reluctantly tells the story of what happened in his
first varsity appearance.
It happened on Monday night, Jan. 21 at Air Force.
The Cards were being demolished by the smaller
"Zoomies," as the Cards called them, and there was about
three minutes to go.
"I never thought I'd get in. I guess when you're losing
you don't think about it. And the coach was probably too
upset to think about the bench.
"Then he [Dallmar] called me to go in. I hadn't taken
off my sweats because I didn't think I'd get in and when
Ed [Schweitzer] fouled out the coach called me and I
couldn't believe it.
"I ripped off my top and ran to the scorer. Since Ed
had fouled out I didn't think I needed to talk to the
coach.
"I took a few steps on the court and all the Zoomies
erupted laughing. I think it was the ref that motioned to
my legs and I looked down and those sweats were as red as
my face."
Smiling, laughing and shaking his head, Wohlstadter
continued, "It was the most embarrasing moment of my
life. I looked up and coach Dallmar was grinning from
ear-to-ear. Well, at least he had something to smile about."
Now, Wohlstadter laughs about the incident and says,
"It gives the team something to talk about. They tell me
they were all screaming and yelling at me, but I was so
amazed to get in, I guess I didn't hear them."

Pieman (45) and Arch Battle for a Rebound
The game is rapidly drawing to a close. There are three
minutes to play. The players on the court are dragging. It's
time for Stanford coach Howie Dallmar to substitute. He
looks down his bench and selects three fresh players.
After a few words of encouragement from him they
come on the floor. Amazingly, they combine for 17 points
and eight rebounds in those three short minutes. The
crowd comes to its feet in response to spinning drives,
25-foot jump shots, and rim-high leaps. In their short
tenure in the game, they wrap up a needed Card victory.
Who are these superstars coming in to seal the win? Are
they Kelley, Patterson and Schweitzer? Or is it some secret
weapon Dallmar hasn't revealed to us?
Well, .. . it's neither. These three late arrivals in the
Stanford-Denver game described above are non other than
Arch, Pieman and Wally.
They are the " Bomb Squad." They are the 10th, 11th
and 12th players on a 12-man team. They are Archie
Dean, Mike Simons and Rich Wohlstadter.
In a normal game, Dallmar uses nine players
interchangeably. The other three, Dean, Simons and
Wohlstadter, only play when the Cards have sewed up a
victory or have been totally blown off the court.
Crowd Pleasers
Yet, when they play, the Stanford crowd comes to life.
Undoubtedly the fan can recall his days on the bench and
can identify with the "bombers." The "bombers"
themselves offer contrasting styles and attitudes towards
the game. You will meet them alphabetically so none of
them will get upset and not give the others the ball this
weekend.
Archie Dean is a 6-3 junior. He averaged 1.2
points-per-game last year after averaging 10.4 a game on
the freshman team. This year he averages 1.2 and is seeing
considerably more action.
Dean was heavily recruited on the east coast after he
graduated from Rutherford (New Jersey) High. He came
to Stanford to play "Big time Pac-8 ball" and because he
felt the Farm offered him the best opportunity athletically
and academically.
He sees himself as a good player whose full potential
hasn't been recognized by the Card coaching staff. Dean is
frank when he says his basketball fortunes have been "very
disappointing." He says,"I think I should be playing
more. I'm not being given a fair shake. It hurts to be on
the bench and I know I have the ability to start here."
Dean rejects the role many bench-ridden players
assume. "It's hard to be a cheerleader when I know I
should be playing. Sure I'll cheer someone who makes a
good play but its hard to be cheering when I'm here [on
the bench] instead of playing."
Two Choices
Dean has developed quite a reputation as a "bomber"
in his two years on the varsity. But he puts little stake in
it.
"I resent the term 'bomb squader.' I think I'm a good
shot . . . and its difficult when I get in. I don't know what
you should do. You can show the people what you can do
or run the offense for the coaches."
But, he said smiling, "I don't pass up an open shot

and eight rebounds in those three short minutes. The
crowd comes to its feet in response to spinning drives,
25-foot jump shots, and rim-high leaps. In their short
tenure in the game, they wrap up a needed Card victory.
Who are these superstars coming in to seal the win? Are
they Kelley, Patterson and Schweitzer? Or is it some secret
weapon Dallmar hasn't revealed to us?
Well, .. . it's neither. These three late arrivals in the
Stanford-Denver game described above are non other than
Arch, Pieman and Wally.
They are the " Bomb Squad." They are the 10th, 11th
and 12th players on a 12-man team. They are Archie
Dean, Mike Simons and Rich Wohlstadter.
In a normal game, Dallmar uses nine players
interchangeably. The other three, Dean, Simons and
Wohlstadter, only play when the Cards have sewed up a
victory or have been totally blown off the court.
Crowd Pleasers
Yet, when they play, the Stanford crowd comes to life.
Undoubtedly the fan can recall his days on the bench and
can identify with the "bombers." The "bombers"
themselves offer contrasting styles and attitudes towards
the game. You will meet them alphabetically so none of
them will get upset and not give the others the ball this
weekend.
Archie Dean is a 6-3 junior. He averaged 1.2
points-per-game last year after averaging 10.4 a game on
the freshman team. This year he averages 1.2 and is seeing
considerably more action.
Dean was heavily recruited on the east coast after he
graduated from Rutherford (New Jersey) High. He came
to Stanford to play "Big time Pac-8 ball" and because he
felt the Farm offered him the best opportunity athletically
and academically.
He sees himself as a good player whose full potential
hasn't been recognized by the Card coaching staff. Dean is
frank when he says his basketball fortunes have been "very
disappointing." He says,"I think I should be playing
more. I'm not being given a fair shake. It hurts to be on
the bench and I know I have the ability to start here."
Dean rejects the role many bench-ridden players
assume. "It's hard to be a cheerleader when I know I
should be playing. Sure I'll cheer someone who makes a
good play but its hard to be cheering when I'm here [on
the bench] instead of playing."
Two Choices
Dean has developed quite a reputation as a "bomber"
in his two years on the varsity. But he puts little stake in
it.
"I resent the term 'bomb squader.' I think I'm a good
shot . . . and its difficult when I get in. I don't know what
you should do. You can show the people what you can do
or run the offense for the coaches."
But, he said smiling, "I don't pass up an open shot
when I have one."
As with all bench players, Dean has entertained
thoughts of quitting. However, he says, "Quitting is the
last thing I'll do." As with Simons and Wohlstadter, his
love for the game overcomes his futility on the bench.

Mike Simons is a 6-4 junior who has two more years of
eligibility remaining after redshirting last season. He
averaged 8.8 points per game as a frosh and is currently
scoring 2.8 points-an-outing.
Out of McLean (Virginia) High School, where he was
All-State and All-Metropolitan Washington D.C., Simons
was approached by over 100 schools. Stanford, however,
was the only West Coast school and he chose it for the
climate, the academics and the athletics.
He laughingly says,"I thought I would play here
immediately, but that didn't turn out to be the case."
Three Good Years
He didn't expect to be redshirted but he liked the idea
because it made the academics a little easier. Plus,
"(Stanford assistant coach ] Bub Bowling told me it would
give me three good years instead of two."
Like Dean, Simons feels he deserves a better chance. "I
don't feel I've been given the opportunity some others
have. I don't believe I've gotten a decent shot from my
frosh year on. The coaches don't give me enough credit for
my strengths."
His strengths are mainly his shooting ability. He is the
Cards' best outside shooter and is accurate up to 30 feet.
He also lays claim to the title of "The Nation's Leading
Free Throw Shooter." He is currently 4-4 on the season
from the charity stripe.
Simons is disappointed he hasn't been used in certain
situations, particularly against zones where his outside
touch could prove devastating. He cites this season's
Colorado State and Oregon State games as particular

examples.
"When I do get to play," Simons says, "I'm not
consciously thinking anything. .. . I'm nervous and
excited ... thinking what I should do." And he is exciting
to watch. Against Denver he hit four consecutive
20-foot-plus jumpers which electrified the crowd.
The Simons jump shot is "automatic. My mind is clear
when I'm shooting. If a shot is a good one depends on the
situation. I'd never shoot the bombs I did against Denver if
we had a small lead."
'Haven't Peaked Yet'
Simons, known as Pieman, and as "the Bear" for a Bear
Bryant-like hat he frequently wears (Bowling says it makes
him look like Pinochio), sees Stanford's best games ahead.
"We haven't even peaked yet," he says.
Rich Wohlstadter is a 6-4 sophomore who averaged 8.9
points per-game last year on JV and in his short varsity
tenure is scoring 0.7 points per game. He started the
season as the varsity's 13th man, but moved up with the
departure of Dave Frost.
He was only semi-recruited out of Los Angeles'
University High and is not on scholarship. He is a very
talented shooter and a spectacular jumper.
On the bench Wohlstadter says "I'm not thinking . ..
I'm just hoping for a win. I know I'm not going in but its
no fun to be a loser and be on the bench.
"It doesn't bother me that I'm not playing because I
haven't shown enough in practice. I'm content for now
until I can prove my ability to myself and the coaches."
Wohlstadter approves of his cheerleader role. At one
point against UCLA he flew off the bench screaming and it
looked like he was going to deck referee Ernie Filiberti. He
says, "It's good to be a cheerleader from the bench. If you
don't say something you're more likely to get upset."
Wohlstadter, whom teammate Ed Schweitzer
affectionally calls "The Idiot," is a very mild-mannered,
always smiling, and soft-spoken individual.
Embarrassing Debut
He reluctantly tells the story of what happened in his
first varsity appearance.
It happened on Monday night, Jan. 21 at Air Force.
The Cards were being demolished by the smaller
"Zoomies," as the Cards called them, and there was about
three minutes to go.
"I never thought I'd get in. I guess when you're losing
you don't think about it. And the coach was probably too
upset to think about the bench.
"Then he [Dallmar] called me to go in. I hadn't taken
off my sweats because I didn't think I'd get in and when
Ed [Schweitzer] fouled out the coach called me and I
couldn't believe it.
"I ripped off my top and ran to the scorer. Since Ed
had fouled out I didn't think I needed to talk to the
coach.
"I took a few steps on the court and all the Zoomies
erupted laughing. I think it was the ref that motioned to
my legs and I looked down and those sweats were as red as
my face."
Smiling, laughing and shaking his head, Wohlstadter
continued, "It was the most embarrasing moment of my
life. I looked up and coach Dallmar was grinning from
ear-to-ear. Well, at least he had something to smile about."
Now, Wohlstadter laughs about the incident and says,
"It gives the team something to talk about. They tell me
they were all screaming and yelling at me, but I was so
amazed to get in, I guess I didn't hear them."

Pieman (45) and Arch Battle for a Rebound
The game is rapidly drawing to a close. There are three
minutes to play. The players on the court are dragging. It's
time for Stanford coach Howie Dallmar to substitute. He
looks down his bench and selects three fresh players.
After a few words of encouragement from him they
come on the floor. Amazingly, they combine for 17 points
and eight rebounds in those three short minutes. The
crowd comes to its feet in response to spinning drives,
25-foot jump shots, and rim-high leaps. In their short

Who are these superstars coming in to seal the win? Are
they Kelley, Patterson and Schweitzer? Or is it some secret
