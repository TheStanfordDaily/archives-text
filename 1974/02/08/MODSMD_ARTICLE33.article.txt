Truckers Reject Proposed Settlement
WASHINGTON — Truck traffic was reported
increasing in some areas yesterday, but many independent
truckers' leaders said they would continue their eight-day
strike rather than accept a proposed settlement.
"It's a sellout," said Roger Galloway of Overdrive
Magazine, one influential organization which pushed for the
shutdown that has brought guerrilla warfare tactics in some
areas and left more than 100,000 workers laid off. "They
sold these guys down the river."
The Washington settlement denounced by some
strikers provides for delivery to truck stops of 100 percent
of the diesel fuel needed by drivers and permission for
truckers to get more money for the cargo they haul in
direct proportion to increased fuel costs.
It also was said to provide for an immediate freight
rate surcharge to compensate for recent fuel price increases
and a government study of possible increases in maximum
weights trucks may carry.
Skylab Astronauts Splash Down
SPACE CENTER, Houston — The men of Skylab 3
splash down in the Pacific Ocean this morning to end man's
longest space mission, a 34-million-mile, 84-day voyage of
scientific research and discovery.
Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue and
Edward G. Gibson return to earth at 8:17 a.m. PDT with
the splashdown set for 176 miles southwest of San Diego,
Calif. Officials said the men were "ready to come home."
The astronauts changed their sleep schedule to prepare
for the return to earth and planned to awaken at 8 p.m.
PDT from their final sleep in space. They will undock from
the space station at 3:34 a.m. PDT and perform a series of
maneuvers which will bring their Apollo craft back into the
grasp of earth's gravity.
Skylab, America's first space station and the orbital
home for three crews in the last nine months, will be
abandoned in orbit. Mission Control will test its systems for
about 24 hours, gathering engineering data. Then,
tomorrow, experts will send a signal to switch off electrical
power and turn the 118-foot-long Skylab into a space ghost
ship.
Experts believe it will orbit for five to eight years and
then obey the tug of earth's gravity and streak into the
atmosphere to be burned up by friction.
SLA Claims Hearst Kidnapping
BERKELEY — The revolutionary and mysterious
Symbionese Liberation Army claimed yesterday it had
kidnaped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, and enclosed
her father's gasoline credit card in a letter as proof.
Radio station KPFA, which received the letter, quoted

it as saying Hearst was being held in protective custody and
that ransom demands would be made in subsequent
communications.
It said the organization — which has claimed
responsibility for murdering the Oakland, Calif., school
superintendent last yea" - would "execute" the 19-year-old
coed and anyone who tries to rescue her before its demands
are fulfilled.
Heath Seeks Strike Postponement
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath announced
yesterday a national election for Feb. 28. He was hoping
for overwhelming public support to crush mounting
industrial unrest, spearheaded by a threatened coal miners'
strike.
Heath coupled his announcement with an appeal to
leaders of the country's 280,000 coal miners to postpone
their strike, scheduled for Sunday, until after the
three-week election campaign. The union's policymaking
body was to discuss Heath's appeal today.
In a nationwide television address last night, the prime
minister made it clear that the miners' demands for pay
above ceilings his government has set to combat inflation
would be the prime issue in the elections. The ballot, he
said, would give voters a chance to tell the miners: "Times
are hard. We're all in the same boat and if you sink us now
we will all drown."
Nixon Considers Tape Release
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is actively
considering the public release of Watergate-related tapes
and documents, Vice President Gerald R. Ford said
yesterday.
Ford said that in a meeting with Nixon about 10 days
ago, he "urged that these documents be made available as
quickly as possible. He [Nixon] said that was being actively
considered," the vice president told a news conference.
At another point, Ford said: "I believe at the
appropriate time his lawyers will make certain
recommendations to him to release the documents."
However, he said he has no specific information on
whether the tapes that might be released include recordings
of conversations between Nixon and his fired White House
counsel, John W. Dean 111. He did not indicate what form
such a release might take — such as verbatim transcripts or
summaries. Some of these recordings were made available
earlier to the Watergate special prosecutor.
Today's Weather
Fair today through Saturday. Slightly warmer today.
Low tonight mid 30s to mid 40s. High both days mid 60s
to lower 70s. Light wind.

Nixon Considers Tape Release
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is actively
considering the public release of Watergate-related tapes
and documents, Vice President Gerald R. Ford said
yesterday.
Ford said that in a meeting with Nixon about 10 days
ago, he "urged that these documents be made available as
quickly as possible. He [Nixon] said that was being actively
considered," the vice president told a news conference.
At another point, Ford said: "I believe at the
appropriate time his lawyers will make certain
recommendations to him to release the documents."
However, he said he has no specific information on
whether the tapes that might be released include recordings
of conversations between Nixon and his fired White House
counsel, John W. Dean 111. He did not indicate what form
such a release might take — such as verbatim transcripts or
summaries. Some of these recordings were made available
earlier to the Watergate special prosecutor.
Today's Weather
Fair today through Saturday. Slightly warmer today.
Low tonight mid 30s to mid 40s. High both days mid 60s
to lower 70s. Light wind.
Truckers Reject Proposed Settlement
WASHINGTON — Truck traffic was reported
increasing in some areas yesterday, but many independent
truckers' leaders said they would continue their eight-day
strike rather than accept a proposed settlement.
"It's a sellout," said Roger Galloway of Overdrive
Magazine, one influential organization which pushed for the
shutdown that has brought guerrilla warfare tactics in some
areas and left more than 100,000 workers laid off. "They
sold these guys down the river."
The Washington settlement denounced by some
strikers provides for delivery to truck stops of 100 percent
of the diesel fuel needed by drivers and permission for
truckers to get more money for the cargo they haul in
direct proportion to increased fuel costs.
It also was said to provide for an immediate freight
rate surcharge to compensate for recent fuel price increases
and a government study of possible increases in maximum
weights trucks may carry.
Skylab Astronauts Splash Down
SPACE CENTER, Houston — The men of Skylab 3
splash down in the Pacific Ocean this morning to end man's
longest space mission, a 34-million-mile, 84-day voyage of
scientific research and discovery.
Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue and
Edward G. Gibson return to earth at 8:17 a.m. PDT with
the splashdown set for 176 miles southwest of San Diego,
Calif. Officials said the men were "ready to come home."
The astronauts changed their sleep schedule to prepare
for the return to earth and planned to awaken at 8 p.m.
PDT from their final sleep in space. They will undock from
the space station at 3:34 a.m. PDT and perform a series of
maneuvers which will bring their Apollo craft back into the
grasp of earth's gravity.
Skylab, America's first space station and the orbital
home for three crews in the last nine months, will be
abandoned in orbit. Mission Control will test its systems for
about 24 hours, gathering engineering data. Then,
tomorrow, experts will send a signal to switch off electrical
power and turn the 118-foot-long Skylab into a space ghost
ship.
Experts believe it will orbit for five to eight years and
then obey the tug of earth's gravity and streak into the
atmosphere to be burned up by friction.
SLA Claims Hearst Kidnapping
BERKELEY — The revolutionary and mysterious
Symbionese Liberation Army claimed yesterday it had
kidnaped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, and enclosed
her father's gasoline credit card in a letter as proof.
Radio station KPFA, which received the letter, quoted

it as saying Hearst was being held in protective custody and
that ransom demands would be made in subsequent
communications.
It said the organization — which has claimed
responsibility for murdering the Oakland, Calif., school
superintendent last yea" - would "execute" the 19-year-old
coed and anyone who tries to rescue her before its demands
are fulfilled.
Heath Seeks Strike Postponement
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath announced
yesterday a national election for Feb. 28. He was hoping
for overwhelming public support to crush mounting
industrial unrest, spearheaded by a threatened coal miners'
strike.
Heath coupled his announcement with an appeal to
leaders of the country's 280,000 coal miners to postpone
their strike, scheduled for Sunday, until after the
three-week election campaign. The union's policymaking
body was to discuss Heath's appeal today.
In a nationwide television address last night, the prime
minister made it clear that the miners' demands for pay
above ceilings his government has set to combat inflation
would be the prime issue in the elections. The ballot, he
said, would give voters a chance to tell the miners: "Times

Symbionese Liberation Army claimed yesterday it had
kidnaped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, and enclosed
her father's gasoline credit card in a letter as proof.
Radio station KPFA, which received the letter, quoted

it as saying Hearst was being held in protective custody and
that ransom demands would be made in subsequent
communications.
It said the organization — which has claimed
responsibility for murdering the Oakland, Calif., school
superintendent last yea" - would "execute" the 19-year-old
coed and anyone who tries to rescue her before its demands
are fulfilled.
Heath Seeks Strike Postponement
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath announced
yesterday a national election for Feb. 28. He was hoping
for overwhelming public support to crush mounting
industrial unrest, spearheaded by a threatened coal miners'
strike.
Heath coupled his announcement with an appeal to
leaders of the country's 280,000 coal miners to postpone
their strike, scheduled for Sunday, until after the
three-week election campaign. The union's policymaking
body was to discuss Heath's appeal today.
In a nationwide television address last night, the prime
minister made it clear that the miners' demands for pay
above ceilings his government has set to combat inflation
would be the prime issue in the elections. The ballot, he
said, would give voters a chance to tell the miners: "Times
are hard. We're all in the same boat and if you sink us now
we will all drown."
Nixon Considers Tape Release
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is actively
considering the public release of Watergate-related tapes
and documents, Vice President Gerald R. Ford said
yesterday.
Ford said that in a meeting with Nixon about 10 days
ago, he "urged that these documents be made available as
quickly as possible. He [Nixon] said that was being actively
considered," the vice president told a news conference.
At another point, Ford said: "I believe at the
appropriate time his lawyers will make certain
recommendations to him to release the documents."
However, he said he has no specific information on
whether the tapes that might be released include recordings
of conversations between Nixon and his fired White House
counsel, John W. Dean 111. He did not indicate what form
such a release might take — such as verbatim transcripts or
summaries. Some of these recordings were made available
earlier to the Watergate special prosecutor.
