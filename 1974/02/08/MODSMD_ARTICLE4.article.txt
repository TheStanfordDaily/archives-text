# Voters Oppose Row Site For Emeritus Housing
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
The student body voted to oppose
the proposed construction of an
emeritus faculty housing project on
the Row by a tally of 2402 to 134 in
the ASSU referendum which
concluded yesterday.
President Richard Lyman, when
informed of the result, repeated his
claim that the referendum was of little
consequence, and charged that the
campaign against the project was
"irresponsible" because it was based
on "a great many mistaken
impressions."
Lyman said that the campaign
seized upon "what may have been a
less than complete presentation" of
the University's side of the issue at the
ASSU Senate meeting last week, and
upon a situation in which "no student
had anything to gain from supporting
the project but some thought they had
something to lose."
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend, a
leading opponent of the project, said

the "massive turnout" showed that the
housing project issue is "probably one
of the major issues to affect students
in the last five years."
Lyman said he did not think the
voter turnout was massive. "It's not
large and it's not small," he said.
Difficult To Plan
"I think the whole business [of the
referendum] makes it difficult to do
planning in the best way," Lyman
continued. He said prospective
residents for the project may get the
feeling that students don't want them
to live there.
Lyman added that he thought a
small group of students were
well-informed on the issue but that
most students were not.
Friend disagreed, "We worked
damn hard to inform people on this
issue." Consequently, voters were
"relatively well-informed," he said.
Informed Voters
Friend cited the ASSU Senate
meeting, Daily articles, letters to the
editor, and dorm discussions as ways
in which students were informed.
"I think the good we've done in
holding this referendum outweighs the
negative points," Friend said. "If we
hadn't called- the University to take
notice with the referendum and a
public campaign, we would have been
shuffled to some back room in the
Planning Office."
Friend added, "The fact that 2400
people took the trouble to vote on this
matter indicates it is an important
issue."
Turnout Comparison
Yesterday's voter turnout was 190
less than the election which put the
current Council of Presidents in office
last spring.
Lyman disagreed with Friend's
statement that the most important
thing about the election was the large
number of students who turned out to
vote.
"I can't think why students should
vote for the project," he reaffirmed.
Lyman declined to say that
students voted against the project to
vote against the University, but
suggested that a possible reason they
may have voted the way they did was

a "distrust of the administration."
There are many other possible reasons
to explain the voting, Lyman said.
'Last Minute Publicity'
Elections Commissioner Richard
Haskell attributed the high student
turnout to "last minute publicity" by
"a few people who really went all
out."
Haskell said that many votes were
solicited yesterday both in dormitories
and in White Plaza in front of the Post
Office polling place.
Haskell said that rumors about
"screw-ups" in the referendum were
unfounded, but admitted that the Post
Office polling place ran out of ballots
15 minutes before closing. He said that
enough new ballots were made up by
hand to avoid any problem, however.
