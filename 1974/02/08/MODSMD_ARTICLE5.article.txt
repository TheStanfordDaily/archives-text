# Nine File For Assembly In 21st District
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Stanford employee Herbert
Rhodes Wednesday declared his
intention to file as a candidate in the
June Democratic primary for the 21st
state Assembly district, which includes
the University.
Rhodes, an East Palo Alto
Municipal Councilman who works as
an employment representative in the
University's Office of Personnel and
Employee Relations, joined three
other Democrats, four Republicans
and an American Independent in filing
for the Assembly seat before the 5
p.m. deadline Wednesday.
However, Rhodes said yesterday
that he had made no definite plans to
ran. He wished to "hold all comment
until I decide whether I'm going to file
my final papers." Rhodes and all other
candidates for the state Assembly and
Senate must still file nomination
papers between Feb. 11 and March 8
to get on the primary ballot.
An unsuccessful candidate for the
San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors in 1972, Rhodes said he
would hold a press conference within
the next two weeks "to announce
exactly what I'm going to do."
If he runs, Rhodes will be
opposed for the Democratic
nomination for the Assembly seat by:
Santa Clara County Supervisor Victor
J. Calvo; J. Ken Croft, the Democrats'
1970 Assembly candidate in this area;
and William B. Black, a former East
Palo Alto Municipal Councilman.
Vying for the Republican
nomination are: Herbert E. Smith,
who opposed incumbent Democrat
Don Edwards in a 1972 congressional
election; East Palo Alto Municipal
Councilman Clarence A. Jackson Jr.;
Palo Alto travel agent Jane B. Holland;
and Sunnyvale service station operator
George Burleson.
Burleson is a leader of the
National Service Station Dealers
Association, which last week asked its
600 member-stations in Santa Clara
County to strike in protest against
retail price ceilings on gasoline.
Richard DeJohn, a Mountain
View printer, is the only candidate in
the American Independents' local
Assembly primary.
Incumbent state Sen. Arlen P.
Gregorio, D-San Mateo, will be
unopposed in his bid for renomination
in the new 10th Senate district, which
also includes Stanford. Palo Alto
dentist Donald W. Spicer and College
of San Mateo Trustee James Tormey
Jr. are seeking the Republican
nomination to oppose Gregorio in the
November general election.
Menlo Park engineer Joseph D.
"Joss" Cooney will be the only
candidate in the 10th District
American Independent primary for the
state Senate.
