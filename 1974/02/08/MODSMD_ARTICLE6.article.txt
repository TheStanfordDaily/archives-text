# U.S. Spacecraft Continues Long Voyage
## Pioneer 10 Uncovers Jupiter's Mysteries 
### KEVIN FLYNN 
The computers at NASA's Ames
Research Center at Moffet Field were
quiet Wednesday, as Pioneer 10, a 570
lb. spacecraft, moved behind the sun
in its outward journey farther into
space than ever before.
The action was not in Mountain
View, but a few hundred miles south
in Pasadena, at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, where the first pictures
from another robot spacecraft,
Mariner 10, were coming in from
Venus.
Mariner 10 is passing Venus on its
way to Mercury and the sun; Pioneer
10 and its sister spacecraft a year
behind, Pioneer 11, are headed the
other way — through the outer solar
system of Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond.
Pioneer 10 caused excitement in
Mountain View early last December,
when a 22-month, 620 million mile
voyage brought it within 81,000 miles
of Jupiter for the first close up look at
the planet, a giant glowing ball of
gases.
Scientists crowded into the small
rooms crammed with computer
printers and consoles. As the

spacecraft got closer to the planet, it
withstood increasingly intense
radiation from the planet — at its
strongest, radiation 1000 times that
which would kill a human.
Meteorites Hit Antenna
Micrometeorites pierced the thin
skin of the antenna. Protons and
electrons attacked the telescope and
radio. Jupiter's magnetic field, similar
to earth's but one million times
stronger, momentarily interfered with
control mechanisms on the spacecraft.
But there was joy in Mountain
View that day in December, as Pioneer
10 successfully withstood the
radiation. It went on to photograph
the swirling clouds of the planet with
detail never recorded from earth-based
telescopes.
Pioneer focused on features that
have puzzled scientists for decades —
Jupiter's brilliant bands of dark orange
and white clouds that swirl around the
planet, and the Great Red Spot, a
blemish 8000 miles wide and 30,000
miles long.
Red Spot Theories
Scientists have argued furiously
about the Great Red Spot since it was

first seen 140 years ago. John S.
Lewis, an associate professor at MIT,
has said that "there are more theories
[about the spot] than there are people
who have proposed them."
Pioneer 10 has not solved the
mysteries of the Spot — yet. Intense
analysis of the data received will keep
researchers busy for months before
any conclusions are reached. Indeed
Pioneer 10 project manager Charles
Hall says the data "raises more
questions than it will solve. It always
does."
Some early conclusions about
Jupiter have been reached. Scientists
now know, for example, that the
radiation around the planet is intense.
Jupiter is heavier than predicted; and
its magnetic field extends 4.5 million
miles. Strangely, Jupiter gives off two
and a half times more heat than it
receives from the sun.
Jupiter's Moons
There's a good deal of interest in
Jupiter's 12 moons. Pioneer discovered
that four of them have atmospheres.
One, 10, seems to resemble planets
much closer to the sun.
Scientists find Jupiter a

fascinating planet to study because it
may contain keys to the formation of
the solar system.
For one thing, of all the matter in
the planets of the solar system, 71
percent of it is tied up in Jupiter. The
planet is seen as a gaseous giant,
mostly made up of hydrogen and
helium. Below the swirling clouds,
there may be no surface, just a thick
gaseous atmosphere, with oceans of
liquid hydrogen below, and perhaps a
small solid hydrogen core.
The Red Spot
Just where the Great Red Spot
fits in is the subject of only the wildest
speculation. One theory is that it may
be a raft of hydrogen ice floating on a
bubble of gas. But no one is certain.
Pioneer 10, says the Ames
Research Center, has now traveled
farther and faster than any other
man-made object. Now past Jupiter, it
is headed in the direction of Saturn
and will soon swing out of the solar
system, losing touch with earth at
about two billion miles.

carries a small plaque showing a nude
man and woman and other
information about earth. Scientists
hope that any intelligent being finding
the spacecraft will understand.
Pioneer 11 Forthcoming
The success of Pioneer 10 with
Jupiter has virtually assured that
Pioneer 11, an identical spacecraft on
its way a year behind, will travel even
closer to the planet.
Scientists at Ames and in
Washington will decide this month
whether to make the final mid-course
maneuvers to bring Pioneer 11 across a
higher latitude, and within 15,000
miles of Jupiter by next December.
If Pioneer takes the closer path,
the force of Jupiter's gravity will
slingshot it close to Saturn, for the
first close-up of that planet.

The computers at NASA's Ames
Research Center at Moffet Field were
quiet Wednesday, as Pioneer 10, a 570
lb. spacecraft, moved behind the sun
in its outward journey farther into
space than ever before.
The action was not in Mountain
View, but a few hundred miles south
in Pasadena, at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, where the first pictures
from another robot spacecraft,
Mariner 10, were coming in from
Venus.
Mariner 10 is passing Venus on its
way to Mercury and the sun; Pioneer
10 and its sister spacecraft a year
behind, Pioneer 11, are headed the
other way — through the outer solar
system of Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond.
Pioneer 10 caused excitement in
Mountain View early last December,
when a 22-month, 620 million mile
voyage brought it within 81,000 miles
of Jupiter for the first close up look at
the planet, a giant glowing ball of
gases.
Scientists crowded into the small
rooms crammed with computer
printers and consoles. As the

spacecraft got closer to the planet, it
withstood increasingly intense
radiation from the planet — at its
strongest, radiation 1000 times that
which would kill a human.
Meteorites Hit Antenna
Micrometeorites pierced the thin
skin of the antenna. Protons and
electrons attacked the telescope and
radio. Jupiter's magnetic field, similar
to earth's but one million times
stronger, momentarily interfered with
control mechanisms on the spacecraft.
But there was joy in Mountain
View that day in December, as Pioneer
10 successfully withstood the
radiation. It went on to photograph
the swirling clouds of the planet with
detail never recorded from earth-based
telescopes.
Pioneer focused on features that
have puzzled scientists for decades —
Jupiter's brilliant bands of dark orange
and white clouds that swirl around the
planet, and the Great Red Spot, a
blemish 8000 miles wide and 30,000
miles long.
Red Spot Theories
Scientists have argued furiously
about the Great Red Spot since it was

first seen 140 years ago. John S.
Lewis, an associate professor at MIT,
has said that "there are more theories
[about the spot] than there are people
who have proposed them."
Pioneer 10 has not solved the
mysteries of the Spot — yet. Intense
analysis of the data received will keep
researchers busy for months before
any conclusions are reached. Indeed
Pioneer 10 project manager Charles
Hall says the data "raises more
questions than it will solve. It always
does."
Some early conclusions about
Jupiter have been reached. Scientists
now know, for example, that the
radiation around the planet is intense.
Jupiter is heavier than predicted; and
its magnetic field extends 4.5 million
miles. Strangely, Jupiter gives off two
and a half times more heat than it
receives from the sun.
Jupiter's Moons
There's a good deal of interest in
Jupiter's 12 moons. Pioneer discovered
that four of them have atmospheres.
One, 10, seems to resemble planets
much closer to the sun.
Scientists find Jupiter a

fascinating planet to study because it
may contain keys to the formation of
the solar system.
For one thing, of all the matter in
the planets of the solar system, 71
percent of it is tied up in Jupiter. The
planet is seen as a gaseous giant,
mostly made up of hydrogen and
helium. Below the swirling clouds,
there may be no surface, just a thick
gaseous atmosphere, with oceans of
liquid hydrogen below, and perhaps a
small solid hydrogen core.
The Red Spot
Just where the Great Red Spot
fits in is the subject of only the wildest
speculation. One theory is that it may
be a raft of hydrogen ice floating on a
bubble of gas. But no one is certain.
Pioneer 10, says the Ames
Research Center, has now traveled
farther and faster than any other
man-made object. Now past Jupiter, it
is headed in the direction of Saturn
and will soon swing out of the solar
system, losing touch with earth at
about two billion miles.

man and woman and other
information about earth. Scientists
hope that any intelligent being finding
the spacecraft will understand.
Pioneer 11 Forthcoming
The success of Pioneer 10 with
Jupiter has virtually assured that
Pioneer 11, an identical spacecraft on
its way a year behind, will travel even
closer to the planet.
Scientists at Ames and in
Washington will decide this month
whether to make the final mid-course
maneuvers to bring Pioneer 11 across a
higher latitude, and within 15,000
miles of Jupiter by next December.

Pioneer 11, an identical spacecraft on
its way a year behind, will travel even
closer to the planet.
Scientists at Ames and in
Washington will decide this month
whether to make the final mid-course
maneuvers to bring Pioneer 11 across a
higher latitude, and within 15,000
miles of Jupiter by next December.
If Pioneer takes the closer path,
the force of Jupiter's gravity will
slingshot it close to Saturn, for the
first close-up of that planet.

The computers at NASA's Ames
Research Center at Moffet Field were
quiet Wednesday, as Pioneer 10, a 570
lb. spacecraft, moved behind the sun
in its outward journey farther into
space than ever before.
The action was not in Mountain
View, but a few hundred miles south
in Pasadena, at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, where the first pictures
from another robot spacecraft,
Mariner 10, were coming in from
Venus.
Mariner 10 is passing Venus on its
way to Mercury and the sun; Pioneer
10 and its sister spacecraft a year
behind, Pioneer 11, are headed the
other way — through the outer solar
system of Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond.
Pioneer 10 caused excitement in
Mountain View early last December,
when a 22-month, 620 million mile
voyage brought it within 81,000 miles
of Jupiter for the first close up look at
the planet, a giant glowing ball of
gases.
Scientists crowded into the small
rooms crammed with computer
printers and consoles. As the

spacecraft got closer to the planet, it
withstood increasingly intense
radiation from the planet — at its
strongest, radiation 1000 times that
which would kill a human.
Meteorites Hit Antenna
Micrometeorites pierced the thin
skin of the antenna. Protons and
electrons attacked the telescope and
radio. Jupiter's magnetic field, similar
to earth's but one million times
stronger, momentarily interfered with
control mechanisms on the spacecraft.
But there was joy in Mountain
View that day in December, as Pioneer
10 successfully withstood the
radiation. It went on to photograph
the swirling clouds of the planet with
detail never recorded from earth-based
telescopes.
Pioneer focused on features that
have puzzled scientists for decades —
Jupiter's brilliant bands of dark orange
and white clouds that swirl around the
planet, and the Great Red Spot, a
blemish 8000 miles wide and 30,000
miles long.
Red Spot Theories
Scientists have argued furiously
about the Great Red Spot since it was

first seen 140 years ago. John S.
Lewis, an associate professor at MIT,
has said that "there are more theories
[about the spot] than there are people
who have proposed them."
Pioneer 10 has not solved the
mysteries of the Spot — yet. Intense
analysis of the data received will keep
researchers busy for months before
any conclusions are reached. Indeed
Pioneer 10 project manager Charles
Hall says the data "raises more
questions than it will solve. It always
does."
Some early conclusions about
Jupiter have been reached. Scientists
now know, for example, that the
radiation around the planet is intense.
Jupiter is heavier than predicted; and
its magnetic field extends 4.5 million
miles. Strangely, Jupiter gives off two
and a half times more heat than it
receives from the sun.
Jupiter's Moons
There's a good deal of interest in
Jupiter's 12 moons. Pioneer discovered
that four of them have atmospheres.
One, 10, seems to resemble planets
much closer to the sun.
Scientists find Jupiter a

fascinating planet to study because it
may contain keys to the formation of
the solar system.
For one thing, of all the matter in
the planets of the solar system, 71
percent of it is tied up in Jupiter. The
planet is seen as a gaseous giant,
mostly made up of hydrogen and
helium. Below the swirling clouds,
there may be no surface, just a thick
gaseous atmosphere, with oceans of
liquid hydrogen below, and perhaps a
small solid hydrogen core.
The Red Spot
Just where the Great Red Spot
fits in is the subject of only the wildest
speculation. One theory is that it may
be a raft of hydrogen ice floating on a
bubble of gas. But no one is certain.
Pioneer 10, says the Ames
Research Center, has now traveled
farther and faster than any other
man-made object. Now past Jupiter, it
is headed in the direction of Saturn
and will soon swing out of the solar
system, losing touch with earth at
about two billion miles.

leave the solar system, Pioneer 10

man and woman and other
information about earth. Scientists
hope that any intelligent being finding
the spacecraft will understand.
