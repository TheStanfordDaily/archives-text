## Marxian Economics 
### 
It is rare that disputes over a University department's academic
programs catch the public eye. When they do, it may be because they
touch some deep academic nerve, or because normal
intradepartmental communication proves inadequate.
The recent blowup in the Economics Department may combine
both strains. Economics is one of those disciplines in which
academic, theoretical disagreements are often political as well; here,
the conflict between "orthodox" and "Marxian" economists is as
much ideological as scholarly. At the same time, the department has
never won honors for its concern for the desires of students
(graduate as well as undergraduate), and that only exacerbates the
current imbroglio.
To the naive observer, the economics students' request for a firm
commitment to a program in radical political economics appears
reasonable enough. Marxian economics embraces a substantial body
of theory and analysis; for any economics department to slight it is a
major failing. And petitions carrying the signatures of 208
undergraduates and 50-odd graduate students testify that student
interest is there.
But economics departments, especially in America, often don't
work that way. Even at Stanford, where the eminent Marxian
economist Paul Baran taught for many years, radical political
economics has nearly been ignored. By the end of his career here,
Baran was all but an academic pariah; the department's single
permanent Marxian, John Gurley, was hired (and tenured) before his
work moved toward Marx.
The department might plead empty pockets; but the argument is
weakened badly by the fact of its recent offer to Harvard's Kenneth
Arrow. The offer reportedly carried a salary befitting a Nobel prize
winner — enough to hire two and a half frugal Marxians.
The most serious objection to the students' proposal is that it
would require the department to impose an ideological test on
prospective appointees. Of course, the fact that the department
chooses not to expand in the field of radical political economics
already imposes a subtle ideological standard.
But the central request is not for the department to hire more
Marxists, but for it simply to teach more Marxian economics. In
practice, the best teachers of radical political economics may well be
Marxians — just as the best teachers of "orthodox" economics (i.e.,
most of the present department) are "orthodox" economists. If they
are the best, let them be hired.
It is time for the liberal University to be truly liberal. A program
in radical political economics makes good academic sense, even if it
doesn't sit well with the majority's ideological leanings.

economist Paul Baran taught for many years, radical political
economics has nearly been ignored. By the end of his career here,
Baran was all but an academic pariah; the department's single
permanent Marxian, John Gurley, was hired (and tenured) before his
work moved toward Marx.
The department might plead empty pockets; but the argument is
weakened badly by the fact of its recent offer to Harvard's Kenneth
Arrow. The offer reportedly carried a salary befitting a Nobel prize
winner — enough to hire two and a half frugal Marxians.
The most serious objection to the students' proposal is that it
would require the department to impose an ideological test on
prospective appointees. Of course, the fact that the department
chooses not to expand in the field of radical political economics
already imposes a subtle ideological standard.
But the central request is not for the department to hire more
Marxists, but for it simply to teach more Marxian economics. In
practice, the best teachers of radical political economics may well be
Marxians — just as the best teachers of "orthodox" economics (i.e.,
most of the present department) are "orthodox" economists. If they
are the best, let them be hired.
It is time for the liberal University to be truly liberal. A program
in radical political economics makes good academic sense, even if it
doesn't sit well with the majority's ideological leanings.
