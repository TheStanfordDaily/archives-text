In the past several months, Richard
Nixon has made it perfectly clear that
he has no intention of resigning at this
point in time. And as yet Congress has
shown little inclination to carry out
the commands of the Constitution
through impeachment. But there is a
third possible solution to the crisis of
confidence.
Those advocating resignation are
asking Nixon to leave their way. That
they have failed should not obscure
the possibility of getting him out on
his own terms.
The one way to influence his
opinion on resignation, as on other
major issues, has been demonstrated
time and again by ITT, the dairy
lobby, Robert Vesco, Howard
Hughes, the airlines, Warner Lambert
Pharmaceuticals, the oil industry and
the wheat combines , among many
others.
Under my plan, I and every other
American who would feel better with
an honest man in the White House
would collectively achieve this end by
buying a piece of Richard Nixon. One
dollar each would provide a generous
fund for retirement from the position
of public trust to which he was
elected. Since he has only 26 percent
support in the polls, $1 per dissatisfied
citizen would be quite a fortune,
almost certainly over $100 million.
This would be by far the largest of the
bribes yet offered to him, but still a
nominal price to save a 198 year old
republic.
Nixon might even be persuaded to
help with publicity and support for
this plan, in order to become even
richer than he already has. He might,
in a televised address, ask the
American people to help him decide
the fate of their Republic by sending
him money. After that, a few more
disclosures and White House "bomb
shells" could help further increase

revenues. Imagine "SEND HIM A
DOLLAR IF YOU THINK HE'S
GUILTY" bumper stickers. Perhaps
the money received would even be
funneled to a Mexican bank account
administered by Bebe Rebozo for old
time sake.
I've already sent in my dollar. If
enough others also do so, the offer will
become tempting.

I write to commend Terry Anzur
for her fine series of articles on
Stanford fund-raising and to make one
clarification. I'm incorrectly quoted in
the second article as stating "Those
who favor unrestricted giving are
taking up the cudgel and calling
Packard a liar." What I said was that,
in response to a speech of Mr.
Packard's urging corporations to more
closely restrict giving, those
corporations with long-standing
policies of unrestricted giving would
probably take up the cudgels and
defend those policies.

I was much amused by your recent
article on the Stanford streakers.
Surely in this free-thinking academic
environment, we can be broad-minded
enough to accept harmless
idiosyncrasies in human behavior:
"different streaks for different
freaks," if I may paraphrase an often
used excuse for all kinds of bizarre
behavior. So long as these NUDE-niks
are content to restict themselves to
purely visual ASSault, what the hell?

I was much amused by your recent
article on the Stanford streakers.
Surely in this free-thinking academic
environment, we can be broad-minded
enough to accept harmless
idiosyncrasies in human behavior:
"different streaks for different
freaks," if I may paraphrase an often
used excuse for all kinds of bizarre
behavior. So long as these NUDE-niks
are content to restict themselves to
purely visual ASSault, what the hell?

In the past several months, Richard
Nixon has made it perfectly clear that
he has no intention of resigning at this
point in time. And as yet Congress has
shown little inclination to carry out
the commands of the Constitution
through impeachment. But there is a
third possible solution to the crisis of
confidence.
Those advocating resignation are
asking Nixon to leave their way. That
they have failed should not obscure
the possibility of getting him out on
his own terms.
The one way to influence his
opinion on resignation, as on other
major issues, has been demonstrated
time and again by ITT, the dairy
lobby, Robert Vesco, Howard
Hughes, the airlines, Warner Lambert
Pharmaceuticals, the oil industry and
the wheat combines , among many
others.
Under my plan, I and every other
American who would feel better with
an honest man in the White House
would collectively achieve this end by
buying a piece of Richard Nixon. One
dollar each would provide a generous
fund for retirement from the position
of public trust to which he was
elected. Since he has only 26 percent
support in the polls, $1 per dissatisfied
citizen would be quite a fortune,
almost certainly over $100 million.
This would be by far the largest of the
bribes yet offered to him, but still a
nominal price to save a 198 year old
republic.
Nixon might even be persuaded to
help with publicity and support for
this plan, in order to become even
richer than he already has. He might,
in a televised address, ask the
American people to help him decide
the fate of their Republic by sending
him money. After that, a few more
disclosures and White House "bomb
shells" could help further increase

revenues. Imagine "SEND HIM A
DOLLAR IF YOU THINK HE'S
GUILTY" bumper stickers. Perhaps
the money received would even be
funneled to a Mexican bank account
administered by Bebe Rebozo for old
time sake.
I've already sent in my dollar. If
enough others also do so, the offer will
become tempting.

I write to commend Terry Anzur
for her fine series of articles on
Stanford fund-raising and to make one
clarification. I'm incorrectly quoted in
the second article as stating "Those
who favor unrestricted giving are
taking up the cudgel and calling
Packard a liar." What I said was that,
in response to a speech of Mr.
Packard's urging corporations to more
closely restrict giving, those
corporations with long-standing
policies of unrestricted giving would
probably take up the cudgels and
defend those policies.
