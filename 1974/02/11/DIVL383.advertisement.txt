In an environment that brings
to the top, fast.
The growth of our Subsidiary companies has been based on
aggressively searching out and analyzing the financial service needs
of individual consumer and corporate customers—and then
expertly providing them.
St JI (A few quick facts: Citicorp is the most profitable financial services
organization of its kind in the world. From just three U.S. locations
in 1969, Citicorp today, mostly through our non-banking subsidiaries,
serves 25 states via almost 200 offices. These subsidiaries also
complement Citibank's global presence in more than 90 countries.)
That's why we suggest you consider the advantages of building
your career by helping us to expand our leadership and our growth.
(A few more quick facts: Citicorp is considered one of the top
companies "executive development." We've eliminated
V J the long-gray-whiskers aspects of financial services. Attaining the
S level of V-P while in your early 30's won't make you exceptional.)
Because we have this group of closely related subsidiaries with
similar management philosophies, directed by highly skilled
professional managers, we are able to offeryou a variety of challenges
and opportunities—intellectually, professionally and geographically.
By maintaining our 15% growth rate, we'll double in size in
5 years. Therefore we're concerned with filling key management
positions which will be open in 1980 now.
A talk could be well worth while. Please direct your inquiry to
Mr. Arthur P. D'Elia, First National City Corporation, 399 Park Avenue,
New York City 10022. An Equal Opportunity Employer M/F.
We invite you to meet with our
campus recruiter on Feb. 12.
