# Gas Dealers May Ration Supplies
## 
### MEREDITH HEISER 
Santa Clara County service stations
are scheduled today to begin a
voluntary "odd-even" gas rationing
plan, originally implemented in
Oregon. However, the number of area
stations that will adopt the plan is
unknown.
Under the system, drivers of cars
with even-numbered license plates buy
gas on even-numbered days; those with
odd-numbered license plates purchase
gas on odd-numbered days. License
plate numbers ending in zero and
personalized plates are considered
even.
Emergency vehicle drivers and
owners of cars with out-of-state license
plates will be allowed to buy gas any
day.
Minimum Purchase
The local plan, unlike Oregon's,
establishes a minimum purchase of six
gallons or $3. This limit should stop
buyers from stocking up on one or two
gallons every day, making service
station lines intolerably long. Small
cars and motor bikes will not be
subject to the minimum limit.
Ten gallons is the suggested
maximum gas purchase.
The National Service Station
Dealers Association of Santa Clara
County has asked only county stations
to consider the odd-even rationing
plan. Because Menlo Park is in San
Mateo County, stations there are not
included.
Drivers In Favor
Gary Andrews, manager of Campus
Shell, says a poll of his customers he
conducted revealed that drivers are
generally in favor of the new rationing
plan.
Andrews operates Campus Shell
independently of the NSSDA. He will
contact other local dealers before he
decides whether to institute odd-even
rationing at his station. Beginning at 9
a.m. today he will sell gas to any
customer until his daily quota is sold.
Andrews supports the minimum
buying limit, but he thinks a
maximum limit will only cause longer
lines. "People will just go to more than
one gas station to fill up their tanks,"
he says.
Ken Davis, a San Jose Shell
manager and president of the Santa
Clara County NSSDA, strongly
supports the odd-even rationing
method.
No Hardship
Davis studied purchasing patterns at
his station for one week. He concluded
"that the average fill-up is presently
nine gallons, while at one time it was
15-16 gallons." Consequently, he
predicts that a 10-gallon maximum
will not put a real hardship on the
majority of the gas-buying public.
Like Andrews, Davis favors a
minimum purchase limit.
Davis discussed the odd-even
rationing plan with members of the
San Jose Chamber of Commerce Feb.
7. He believes that 60-70 percent of
San Jose area gas stations will adopt
the plan within the next six or seven
days. The odd-even method would
shorten lines at every service station
where it is implemented, Davis
predicts.
Ed Kellar, who manages Stanford
Texaco and is a member of the
NSSDA board of directors, says, "Any
type of gas rationing would be an
infringement of individual rights."
