"Everybody needs somebody that they can
talk to
Someone to open up their ears
And let that trouble through
Now you don't have to sympathize
Or care what they may do
But everybody needs somebody that they
can talk to"
—John Prine
And so it goes for those who are in
prison. I gave my name to the inside-out
program here at the Stanford Chapel and as a
result received letters from two prisoners.
One of them wrote pretty low keyed letters
and our correspondence eventually stopped.
The other prisoner, George, was more than
eager to write and has made my participation
in the inside-out program an enlightening
experience.
In his first letter he wrote and told me
of his various misdeeds which led him to
incarceration. I was a little bit apprehensive
in knowing that I would be writing someone
convicted of two counts of armed robbery
and an escape, so I sat down and
meticulously wrote out a letter trying my
best not to exceed any boundaries that might
offend the man. I received a quick reply and
am now writing George as often as I can.
His letters sometimes go off on wild
tangents describing the poor conditions of
the prison system he knows so well. His
attitude seems immature for a man in his

forties, yet when dealing with other subjects
such as the human traits of his fellow
prisoners George comes on way above his
simple background as a used car salesman.
He interprets his commission of criminal
acts as mere expressions of greed (wanting
immediately those things which he couldn't
afford).
In one of his letters George included a
poem he had written aptly describing his
feelings of prison life;
I am society's collector of debts, and
My purse is the bottomless maw of time
Insatiably storing the payments of days
Implacably totaling the months and
years ...
Come — come and look upon the faces of
these I hold
And see thereon the reflection of my
image
Engraven as a deep and final proof
Of society's inadequacy, of man's
inhumanity ...
I am gut-searching anguish destroying the
man
Who is desperate hope,
Waiting
For the letters, the visitors . . ~ that never
come ...
Yes, I am the prison
Wherein the smothering confines of a
steel-barred cage

Tim Foote
Crushed with the weight of inhuman
reality;
Wherein the endless emptiness of the days
And the shattering loneliness of the
eternal nights
Repeat and repeat and repeat my
message . .endless.
The poem can't be classified as polished
literature yet it has a quality above grass
roots level which drives home George's
feelings of being limited in his lifestyle and
the boredom such a predicament affords. I
was really touched by its message though
George considered it a waste of his time.
He does involve himself in more
important activities such as pending court
cases seeking prisoner's rights. He doesn't
seem to be getting anywhere with the cases
for the time being but his hopes are high.
I continue to encourage him in my
letters to keep up his work on the cases,
though I don't know whether he listens to
my advice or not. However we do manage to
carry on a good level of correspondence
sharing our common interest in the criminal
justice system. Though the feelings expressed
in our letters are at times very bitter the
opportunity that the inside-out program has
given us to "let that trouble through," is
sincerely appreciated. I've thoroughly
enjoyed the program.
