# To Stanford Christians

In spite of and perhaps
because of all our talk about
"Christian commitment" and all
of our emphatic zeal toward
evangelism, we are guilty of
neglecting the most basic tenecs of
our faith. I seriously doubt that
many of us are actually walking
"worthy of the calling" with
which we have been called. (Eph.
4:1)
I challenge each of you to
examine your own life and
lifestyle. How are you responding
to Jesus's final plea, "Feed my
sheep?" How often we rationalize
by interpreting the Word
"literally" only when it suits us
and doesn't conflict with the
status quo of our own lives and
the world around us.
Going to Stanford and being
a member of the "intellectual
elite" does not make us exempt
from the responsibilities of caring
for our neighbors in a real and
concrete way. Our isolation in our
ivory tower makes it all too easy
to forget and gloss over the fact
that there is still a world out there
where people are starving. Not
just "hungry for the Word of
Jesus," but physically dying while
we passively sit back or offer
them some nebulous religious
panacea.
The Good News of
Christianity is not that Jesus loves
you, la, la, la, but that you are
willing to love as you have been
loved, that you are willing to be
actively involved in the welfare of
other people. The martyr in each
of us responds to Jesus's words,
"Greater love has no one than
this, that one lay down their
life .. but how many of us are
laying down our life, time,
money, possessions, problems,
and own self-interest on an
everyday basis?
Committed Christian Living
In my opinion, the reason
Stanford "Christians" have so
little success in calling people to
Christ is that we aren't even really
following Him. The Gospel is
spoken loudest in the language of
love, evidenced in committed
Christian living.
I find it hard to believe that
someone who was so concerned

about the physical realities and
oppression of the people around
Him, would have us justify for a
minute our refusal to deal with
and commit ourselves to pressing
social issues by our pretenses of
"waiting for His return."
James 2:14-20 says: "What
use is it, my brethren, if a man
says he has faith, but he has no
works? Can that faith save him? If
a brother or sister is without
clothing and in need of daily
food, and one of you says to
them, 'Go in peace, be warmed
and be filled,' and yet you do not
give them what is necessary for
their body; what use is that? Even
so faith, if it has no works, is
dead, being by itself.
Faith Without Works Useless
"But someone may well say,

'You have faith, and I have works;
show me your faith without the
works, and I will show you my
faith by my works.' You believe
that God is one. You do well; the
demons also believe and shudder.
But are you willing to recognize,
you foolish fellow, that faith
without works is useless?"
The burden of this
admonition rests on the shoulders
of the entire Body. As such, at
least while I have been at
Stanford, The Stanford Christian
Body has made no significant
contribution to the lives of
anyone except its own members,
if that. The criticisms we meet
from non-Christians are usually
justified and in general we have
succeeded in being more
obnoxious than effective.

We have not collectively
taken a stand, much less action,
toward any of the social ills and
outrages of our time. Our narrow
vision is content with our weekly
Bible study and prayer groups, ice
skating parties, and Dorm
Evangelism. Perhaps the time has
come to include Jesus in our
Christianity.
Those of you who have been
unable to pass off or rationalize
away the contentions of this
challenge and yet feel the
frustration of not knowing what
you can do are in much the same
situation as I am. Perhaps we can
tackle some of these problems
together as Jesus suggested we
should.

and commit ourselves to pressing
social issues by our pretenses of
"waiting for His return."
James 2:14-20 says: "What
use is it, my brethren, if a man
says he has faith, but he has no
works? Can that faith save him? If
a brother or sister is without
clothing and in need of daily
food, and one of you says to
them, 'Go in peace, be warmed
and be filled,' and yet you do not
give them what is necessary for
their body; what use is that? Even
so faith, if it has no works, is
dead, being by itself.
Faith Without Works Useless
"But someone may well say,

'You have faith, and I have works;
show me your faith without the
works, and I will show you my
faith by my works.' You believe
that God is one. You do well; the
demons also believe and shudder.
But are you willing to recognize,
you foolish fellow, that faith
without works is useless?"
The burden of this
admonition rests on the shoulders
of the entire Body. As such, at
least while I have been at
Stanford, The Stanford Christian
Body has made no significant
contribution to the lives of
anyone except its own members,
if that. The criticisms we meet
from non-Christians are usually
justified and in general we have
succeeded in being more
obnoxious than effective.

We have not collectively
taken a stand, much less action,
toward any of the social ills and
outrages of our time. Our narrow
vision is content with our weekly
Bible study and prayer groups, ice
skating parties, and Dorm
Evangelism. Perhaps the time has
come to include Jesus in our
Christianity.
Those of you who have been
unable to pass off or rationalize
away the contentions of this
challenge and yet feel the
frustration of not knowing what
you can do are in much the same
situation as I am. Perhaps we can
tackle some of these problems
together as Jesus suggested we
should.

In spite of and perhaps
because of all our talk about
"Christian commitment" and all
of our emphatic zeal toward
evangelism, we are guilty of
neglecting the most basic tenecs of
our faith. I seriously doubt that
many of us are actually walking
"worthy of the calling" with
which we have been called. (Eph.
4:1)
I challenge each of you to
examine your own life and
lifestyle. How are you responding
to Jesus's final plea, "Feed my
sheep?" How often we rationalize
by interpreting the Word
"literally" only when it suits us
and doesn't conflict with the
status quo of our own lives and
the world around us.
Going to Stanford and being
a member of the "intellectual
elite" does not make us exempt
from the responsibilities of caring
for our neighbors in a real and
concrete way. Our isolation in our
ivory tower makes it all too easy
to forget and gloss over the fact
that there is still a world out there
where people are starving. Not
just "hungry for the Word of
Jesus," but physically dying while
we passively sit back or offer
them some nebulous religious
panacea.
The Good News of
Christianity is not that Jesus loves
you, la, la, la, but that you are
willing to love as you have been
loved, that you are willing to be
actively involved in the welfare of
other people. The martyr in each
of us responds to Jesus's words,
"Greater love has no one than
this, that one lay down their
life .. but how many of us are
laying down our life, time,
money, possessions, problems,
and own self-interest on an
everyday basis?
Committed Christian Living
In my opinion, the reason
Stanford "Christians" have so
little success in calling people to
Christ is that we aren't even really
following Him. The Gospel is
spoken loudest in the language of
love, evidenced in committed
Christian living.
I find it hard to believe that
someone who was so concerned

about the physical realities and
oppression of the people around
Him, would have us justify for a
minute our refusal to deal with
and commit ourselves to pressing
social issues by our pretenses of
"waiting for His return."
James 2:14-20 says: "What
