# Oil And Blackmail

Much is being presently said about "oil
blackmail" by the Arabs. There is a rising crescendo
of condemnation and many a plea for bravado to
resist this "blackmail"; this discussion, however,
remains biased and one-sided.
The real question is whether a state or a group
of sovereign states have the right or not to regard
their trade and foreign policies as complimentary.
Is not a country free to fashion its trade policy
according to its own enlightened interests, or must
it be made subservient to the interests of certain
foreign countries, irrespective of these foreign
countries' attitude toward its own interests?
In the present chorus of Arab-bashing on oil,
would it be too much to recall that the new trade
agreement which President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger
have negotiated with Soviet Russia, assigning to her
"the most favored nation status," has been
condemned by some of these very critics of the "oil
blackmail" on the ground that Russia is not
allowing enough "Jewish emigration?"
The principle involved is that the American
economic policy must be used as a lever to get the
domestic and foreign policies of Russia changed.
The entire foreign aid doctrine is based on this very
concept of political leverage. The policy of
economic and political sanctions against Rhodesia
and South Africa, and all talk of sanctions against
Portugal, Mozambique, and Greece in view of their
political policies are species of the same gene.
If all the other countries of the world are
entitled to apply economic and political policies as
a twin lever in international relations why should

all the Arabs bo an exception to that?
The economic doctrine of protection and the
concept of "most favored nation" themselves speak
volumes about the relationship of the two â€” the
international economic and political policies. The
idea of economic sanction is as much a part of
international law and practice as that of aid and
trade. If the United States, Britain and other
countries are justified in using all these instruments
of policy, why is it that it becomes 'blackmail'
when the Arabs try to resort to some of them, and
that, too, in a very restrained way?
There is one more dimension to the problem.
What is the objective for which the oil leverage is
being used? Is it for a new Palestine doctrine? Or
just the implementation of the UN resolutions on
the Israeli vacation of the Arab territories? Israel's
continuing defiance of the world body is a ground
enough for the imposition of economic sanctions
by all the UN members against Israel.
If the international community is prepared to
do nothing more than the occasional lip service,
then what alternative is left to, the aggrieved party?
The Arab oil policy is only intended to arouse the
conscience of the Western nations to do nothing
more than implement the UN resolutions.
Every country has a right to coordinate its
policies, to achieve ends that are just, morally and
politically. Why is it that the Arabs fail even to get
a sympathetic ear while others get fullest support
for similar policies, and often lesser causes?
