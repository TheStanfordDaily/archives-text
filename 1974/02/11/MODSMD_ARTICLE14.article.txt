No subject has been
dissected, analyzed,
psychoanalyzed and commented
upon more thoroughly in the last
year than the campaign scandals
of the Nixon administration. We
are all getting tired of reading the
"how-could-it-happen" columns;
but some important points have
been left unstated.
As much as many try to
deny it, politics is a profession.
Unlike many other professions,
however, there are no formal
procedures for training
certification or admission into the
profession of political
campaigning. Democracies rightly
embrace the ideal of open access
to the channels of political power,
and this means giving everyone a
chance to campaign for a political
candidate, in as high a position aF
the candidate sees fit.
Once plunged into the
profession, however, the amateur
politico will find no written rules
or professional code of ethics to
restrain or guide his conduct.
There are the state and federal
laws, of course, but there is nc
attempt made by the experienced
party professionals to set some
kind of standards for new
campaign executives.
Particularly because of the
intensely partisan and
competitive nature of political
work, the only ethic that is
uniformly impressed upon all new
entrants to campaign hierarchies is
the imperative of victory.
Cheap, Slimy
Politics needs to become
more of a profession. The cheap
and slimy images that it conjures
up for so many average citizens
can begin to be removed if
politicians will view themselves
and their work in a more
professional way. Politics is not a
cheap game for people who have
no better way to gratify their
egos. More immediately and
directly than law, medicine,
business or any other profession,
politics is the future of the
country.
Politicians shudder to call
themselves professional. But this
is because there has never been an
image of a professional politician
other than the chronic
campaigner, the political
gun-for-hire, who latches on to
any campaign in sight like a leech
desperate for a fresh source of
blood. But there are other kinds
of professional politicians.
Among the mass of slobs and
egomaniacs, I have met numerous
professional politicians whose
style and standards and
commitment I admired. The
answer to the Watergate mess is
not for this nation's youth to
abandon politics, but to make it a
worthy and respectable
profession, as these few men and
women have attempted to do.
Inclusive, Modest, Aggressive
Young people must bring to
politics the style of a true
professional — one that is
inclusive rather than exclusive;
modest rather than arrogant;
aggressive, but not obsessed. A
real political pro wants to bring as
many people into the political
process as he or she can, to build
as broad a coalition as possible
behind the candidate and/or issues
that the campaign is pushing.
A professional wants to get a
job done. He has no time for the
ego games that often allow a
serious political effort to
degenerate into a shambles of
overlapping personal conflicts.
But a politician with a
genuine sense of professional
conduct does not want to win at
any price. He has a strong sense of
how precious and delicate our
democratic process is — how
vulnerable it is to decay if not
protected by ethical standards.
Strong And Clear Limits
The political pros I have
respected had strong and clear
limits to the kinds of tactics they
were willing to employ. These
kinds of limits need to be
explicitly articulated in a
professional code of ethics that
each political party will adopt and
enforce upon its members.
Legislation from Congress is
badly needed, but it alone is not
enough. Political parties ought to
be expected to set for their
members standards of professional
conduct in the same way that Bar
Associations have for lawyers.
There is a fear of political
professionals among people in this
country, particularly young
people. But the experience of
Watergate, and of the McGovern
campaign (which would require
another entire article to explain),
should suggest to us that the fear
is misplaced.
The danger is not in having
professionals running our political
campaigns, but rather, in not
demanding of them genuine and
explicit standards of
professionalism.
