# I-Center Removes 'Erotic Art'

Michael Burgess has withdrawn his
one-man exhibit from Bechtel
International Center, after
administrators there refused, on
the first day of the showing, to
include 14 photographs of male
ind female nudes.
The dispute erupted recently
when Burgess' exhibit was hung in
the I-Center, minus the nudes.
When notified that part of his
exhibit would not be shown,
Burgess demanded that the
remaining 40 photographs of
theatrical productions be removed
and the showing canceled.
Burgess said he was told by
I-Center art coordinator Katherine
Millar, who had originally
approved the exhibit including the
nude studies, that other
administrators felt the nudes
might spark protest from women's
liberation groups.
However, I-Center Director A.
Lee Zeigler says the concern was
for visitors from non-western
cultures who might be offended
by the "erotic art."
'Erotic Art'
"I have nothing against erotic
art. I only feel that it is not
appropriate to this particular
site," said Zeigler. "The I-Center
is more than just an art gallery;
it's a meeting place for people of
different cultures. For example,
women from a very protected
non-western culture might find
our eroticism distasteful."
Burgess maintains that the
photographs, some of which show
nude men and women together,
are not erotic art. "If a person
works real hard he might find
them suggestive, but these are just
pictures of people without their
clothes on.
"Mr. Zeigler said it was a
center for an exchange of
cultures," added Burgess. "I
believe these pictures are a better
part of western culture than other
aspects, like violence or ads whre
some woman wants you to fly her
to Atlanta. That is what foreign
persons don't get a chance to get
away from."
No Judgment
A meeting last Wednesday
between Zeigler and Burgess failed
to resolve the dispute. Zeigler
described the meeting as
"cordial." He said that his
decision to ban the photographs
implies no judgment of their
artistic merits, and it does not
mean that nude photos will never
be shown at the I-Center.
Burgess is not unhappy that
Zeigler's action has been
publicized. "I'm sure he wanted
to avoid a controversy," said
Burgess. "I hope he's got one."
Although Burgess acknowledges
that the I-Center decision is final,
he says he is willing to hold the
exhibit somewhere else on or off
campus.

different cultures. For example,
women from a very protected
non-western culture might find
our eroticism distasteful."
Burgess maintains that the
photographs, some of which show
nude men and women together,
are not erotic art. "If a person
works real hard he might find
them suggestive, but these are just
pictures of people without their
clothes on.
"Mr. Zeigler said it was a
center for an exchange of
cultures," added Burgess. "I
believe these pictures are a better
part of western culture than other
aspects, like violence or ads whre
some woman wants you to fly her
to Atlanta. That is what foreign
persons don't get a chance to get
away from."
No Judgment
A meeting last Wednesday
between Zeigler and Burgess failed
to resolve the dispute. Zeigler
described the meeting as
"cordial." He said that his
decision to ban the photographs
implies no judgment of their
artistic merits, and it does not
mean that nude photos will never
be shown at the I-Center.
Burgess is not unhappy that
Zeigler's action has been
publicized. "I'm sure he wanted
to avoid a controversy," said
Burgess. "I hope he's got one."
Although Burgess acknowledges
that the I-Center decision is final,
he says he is willing to hold the
exhibit somewhere else on or off
campus.
Free-lance photographer
Michael Burgess has withdrawn his
one-man exhibit from Bechtel
International Center, after
administrators there refused, on
the first day of the showing, to
include 14 photographs of male
ind female nudes.
The dispute erupted recently
when Burgess' exhibit was hung in
the I-Center, minus the nudes.
When notified that part of his
exhibit would not be shown,
Burgess demanded that the
remaining 40 photographs of
theatrical productions be removed
and the showing canceled.
Burgess said he was told by
I-Center art coordinator Katherine
Millar, who had originally
approved the exhibit including the
nude studies, that other
administrators felt the nudes
might spark protest from women's
liberation groups.
However, I-Center Director A.
Lee Zeigler says the concern was
for visitors from non-western
cultures who might be offended
by the "erotic art."
'Erotic Art'
"I have nothing against erotic
art. I only feel that it is not
appropriate to this particular
site," said Zeigler. "The I-Center
is more than just an art gallery;
it's a meeting place for people of
different cultures. For example,
women from a very protected
non-western culture might find
our eroticism distasteful."
