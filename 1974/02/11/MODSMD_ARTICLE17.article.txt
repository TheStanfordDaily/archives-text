# Strike Hits Germany

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)
— West German public service
workers began strikes for higher
wages yesterday after nearly one
million union members voted for
nationwide walkouts to snarl mass
transit, garbage collection, post
offices and airports.
Well over three-quarters of the
lower level unionized employees
of municipal, state and federal
governments voted Thursday and
Friday for strikes to back
demands for monthly wage hikes
of 15 percent. Government
negotiators offered 9.5 percent
when wage talks collapsed last
week.
Chancellor Willy Brandt and
his cabinet met in emergency
session and said they would seek
urgent new negotiations "to avoid
serious effects on the public."

A government communique
said unions would be asked for a
new date at the bargaining table,
but it appeared certain that strikes
would continue as planned
through tomorrow.
Although more than half of
West Germany's 2.2 million
workers do not belong to unions,
they were expected to honor
picket lines.
West German public employees
last went on strike in 1958. That
conflict was settled after a
one-day walkout.
But with labor unions defying
government wage guidelines to
hold down inflationary prices and
unemployment, the current wage
conflict could become the most
extended strike in post-war
Germany.
