# More Inflation, Unemployment
## Profs Predict Economic Trouble 
### GRAHAM VINK 
Stanford economics professors
are forecasting trouble in 1974,
with sharply increased
unemployment, continuing
inflation, and uninspired
performance by the stock market.
Asst. Prof. Hayne Leland terms
the state of the economy
"critically dependent on the oil
boycott," with a likelihood of
"zero grow tli" in the gross
national product for 1974.
However, Leland foresees
possibly declining food prices due
to the strengthened value of the
dollar. He explains that increased
prices for U.S. agricultural
products abroad should decrease
foreign demand, thereby
steadying or lowering prices
domestically.
According to Assoc. Prof.
Melvyn Krauss, "it is clear that
the situation is unclear." Krauss
terms inflation "the big problem"
for at least the first six months of
1974. "However," he says,
"compared to other industrialized
nations, the U.S. is in much better
shape because of America's
relatively good oil supplies."
'Blue' Consumers
Prof. Edward Shaw says,"The
chances of recession are very good
indeed." He sees consumer
behavior "turning bluer,"
affecting purchases of durable
goods. Shaw also warns, "The
underlying circumstances are very
dangerous. At no time since the
19305, when all the other
countries were deflating, have the
indicators looked so bad."
Both Leland and Shaw foresee
mounting pressure from unions
for higher wages. Leland points
out that labor has not seen an
increase in "real wages" over the
past two years. He predicts that
unions will "get wise" very soon.
Shaw foresees a "cost-push"
inflation situation developing, as
unions demand higher pay and
companies raise their prices
reflecting increased costs.
Assoc. Prof. Michael Spence is
slightly more optimistic,
forecasting few major changes in
the economic condition of the

U.S. However, he predicts that
unions will demand cost-of-living
indices in their contracts to
safeguard themselves against
further inflation.
Secondary Repercussions
Prof. Paul David, calling
himself "hardly an expert" says
there will be no more layoffs in
"primary industries â€” such as gas
dealers, truckers, and the auto
industry," due to the oil squeeze.
However, he expects "secondary
repercussions in production and
inventory reductions" during the
next six months at least.
Krauss forecasts "economic
disruption" in some oil related
industries. He say*, "The oil crisis
doesn't hit all areas the
same .. . localized pockets" will
be hit very hard.
Good news forecast by the
economists is the continued
strength of the dollar in relation
to other currencies. Shaw says,
"The dollar could continue to
increase in value because of
America's relatively small
petroleum bill." Leland predicts
the dollar would stay "at or near"
its present level.
Government's Impact
Several different explanations
were offered for the current
malaise of the stock market.
Krauss says flatly, "The market
will be depressed as long as Nixon
is in office." He adds this is not a
personal opinion of Nixon, but
rather a reflection of
government's impact on finance.
He says, "Faith in government's
ability to do things is important.
As long as people doubt the
competence of government, it will
have a bad effect on the economy,

because the federal government is
so important in everyday life."
Most professors agree that the
stock market was a good indicator
of the state of the economy.
Krauss points out that whether
the market is a good forecaster or
not is irrelevent because people
believe in the market and make
decisions on the strength of those
beliefs. Leland says the market is
"quite important. It's a reflection
of businessmen's expectations,"

and influences their inventory
levels and capital flows.
David agrees that "the market
shapes business expectations and
shapes consumption in the upper
income levels." However, David
terms the market "more a
nuisance than a help" pointing
out that it "seriously
overanticipated the effects of the
oil shortage."
