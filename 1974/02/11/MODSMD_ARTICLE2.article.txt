# New Freshman Seminar
## Courses Viewed Critically 
### BONITA B. RODDEN 
The students in this year's
Structured Liberal Education (SLE)
will have a difficult time adjusting to
the conventional curriculum next year
— or so the proponents of this
residential freshman seminar hope.
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall,
director of overseas campuses and
acting chairman of SLE, claims "a
certain maladjustment is needed in
education." The students should be
slightly dissatisfied and
uncomfortable.
After the freshmen complete the 21
units of the SLE program (three fall
quarter, nine winter, and nine spring),
the program's initiators hope the
students will approach their future
classes critically — appreciating the
good ones and demanding improved
teaching in the others.
A group of 12 graduate students
and faculty members have been
formulating the program over a two
year period.
The 20 freshmen were chosen
randomly for this year's pilot program
from their applications to SLE
through Approaching Stanford, an
information booklet sent to incoming
students. Six students from Arroyo,
the dormitory in which the program is
centered, joined SLE winter quarter.
One of the original 20 dropped the
seminar.
It is the goal of the instructors of
SLE that participation in this
structured program of natural sciences,
social sciences, and the humanities will
teach students to question, to reason
logically and to communicate
effectively both orally and in writing.
Another goal of the program is to
reeducate the faculty. Jon Reider, a
graduate student involved in designing
the program, stated that SLE forces
professors who he feels are
unaccustomed to cooperating
intellectually to work collectively.
All those participating in SLE feel
its most valuable aspect is the
inter-disciplinary dialogue between the
various professors as they work
together. In SLE. the students along
with faculty members challenge the
speaker during his talk. The students

have an opportunity to hear various
professors' perspectives on a topic in
one class period.
Faculty, graduate students, house
associates, and occasionally students
lead a series of lectures, discussion
groups and tutorial sessions. The
founders hope involvement in this
kind of learning environment will
force the students to forego a passive
approach to education.
Initially, the students hesitated to
contribute, letting the graduate
students and the faculty carry on most
of the conversation. One student,
George Lopatin, recalls his
intimidation: "You really had to be
careful not to make a fool of
yourself."
Reider said some freshman are
confused about the seminar at times.
Students consider the reading

strenuous and the concepts difficult,
yet Reider notices some of the ideas
are challenging them intellectually.
Nearly everyone involved in SLE
finds it worthwhile. One science and
mathematics oriented student, Scott
Von Laven, feels he is receiving a
liberal arts background which he might
have avoided if he had merely chosen
classes from the established
curriculum. Other students enjoy the
informality and the personal attention
offered by SLE.
Reider finds working with
undergraduates more entertaining than
working with graduate students
because a graduate student is
frequently intellectually closed off by
complete immersion in his particular
field. What Mancall enjoys is the
candor and enthusiasm of the
freshmen toward intellectual ideas.
