# No Hullabillusion
## Astronomer Probes VFOs

By CECILE HEROLD
"It wasn't no hullabillusion,"
iaid one farmer at a phenomenal
UFO sighting in 1966 near Ann
Arbor, Michigan. The next day,
Astronomer J. Allen Hynek was
asked by the Air Force to
investigate the case, as he had one
hundred cases before in the
preceeding twenty years.
Hynek, chairman of the
Astronomy Department at
Northwestern University and
director of the Dearbon
Observatory, spoke on this anu
other UFO sightings Friday night
at the physics tank.
"When first appointed by the
Air Force as their investigator,"
he explained, "I thought it would
be fun. 1 could prove to the
crazies that UFOs simply did not
exist and expected the fad to
fizzle by 1952."
Instead, Hynek has discovered
that UFO sightings are reported
by credible sources in a credible
way.
After his analysis of a
particular case, Hynek plots his
information on a graph using two
point indexes: first, on the
strangeness variable — the amount

of information given and left
unexplained; second, on the
probability of the occurrence.
"Some subjectivity must enter
here," he said. "I never assign a
probability point greater than two
when the UFO has been sighted
by only one person. And I must
judge the credibility of the
witnesses themselves."
Some observers, when put
under hypnosis, will break out in
a cold sweat while recounting
their experiences. One man, left
.lone after interrogation, was
overheard praying.
Cranks And Fakes
Of course, Hynek has received
crank reports with fake
photographs given as evidence.
Once, a fellow handed hi»n a
picture which Hynek identified
immediately as a linticular cloud.
"Ah yes," cried the donor, "but
the UFO is inside!" Another time,
he received a picture of an
out-of-focus banana split.
From serious reports, however,
Hynek has noted the following
characteristic UFO patterns: the
object appears in clear weather in
an isolated region such as
farmland or desert. The craft

makes a faint humming sound or
no sound whatsoever.
Often it has dazzling orange
lights and hovers about six feet in
the air before suddenly rising and
seeming to disappear in its own
cloud.
Calling Cards
Some crafts have reportedly
touched down, leaving a
phosphorescent glow on the soil
below, almost like a calling card.
Scientists have found that the
affected soil can no longer hold
water.
Hynek then posed the number
one question, "Is anybody out
there?" He explained, "If space,
as far as we have explored it, was
constructed on a model-scale
stretching from New York to San
pvqn-.'sco, f 1 " earth would not be
Visiuie even with the most
powerful microscope.
"Should only this tiny speck
hold life?" The principle
argument against outer-space
visitors is "How can they possibly
get here? Perhaps the speed of
light is not the limit of speed," he
suggested. "And perhaps there is
such a thing as a life span of 5000
years."
