Extension of Eucalyptus Drive between Galvez St.and Sam
McDonald Road is underway near Stanford Stadium and will be
completed within the month, weather permitting.
Sam McDonald Road will be closed and turned into a pedestrian
mall fitted with pathway lights.
At the same time, Galvez St. just north of the Campus Drive
intersection is being modified to accommodate the new street.
Galvez will be widened and divided between Eucalyptus and
Campus Drive, according to Oscar Nelson, master planner, and John
Lerry, manager of construction and engineering.
The extension of Eucalyptus is expected to give better traffic
circulation to the stadium parking area and the deGuerre Pools and
Courts complex, according to the planning officials.
Cost of the project is about $70,000, they said.
