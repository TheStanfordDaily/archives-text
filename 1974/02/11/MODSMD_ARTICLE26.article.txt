# Hannaford Goes Seven For Eight
## Cards Salvage Opening Twinbill 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Like most early season
doubleheaders, Saturday's
baseball games between Stanford
and University of San Francisco
Saturday afternoon at Sunken
Diamond featured trivial mistakes,
errors, so-so pitching and
outstanding hitting.
For some 250 spectators it was
a beautiful afternoon to leisurely
bask in the sun. And for almost
six-and-a-half hours the setting
was quite sleepy. But for those
few remaining at the end,
shivering in the twilight chill,
there was some last inning drama,
too.
Stanford rallied to score four
times in the ninth inning of the
nightcap to edge the Dons 8-7,
salvaging a split for the day. USF
had taken the first game, a
seven-inning affair, by eclipsing a
seven-run deficit to win 10-8.
Stanford (1-1) plays host to
University of Santa Clara, which
swept a doubleheader from
UC-Davis 20-0 and 12-5 Saturday,

tomorrow at 2 p.m. in Sunken
Diamond.
If there was one player who
had to be singled out for a fine
day the vote would be unanimous
in choosing Stanford's third
baseman Kim Hannaford, who
was seven-for-eight. Hannaford,
who reached first base eight times,
was retired only once â€” a
strikeout in the fifth inning of the
second game.
"It was just a great day," said
Hannaford. "I got mad after the
strikeout because it cost us two
runs early in the game."
Except for that one blemish
Hannaford's day and year is
almost perfect. He was
four-for-four in the first game and
singled in his first trip to the plate
in the second, then drew a walk,
struck out, singled and doubled.
The last double was a crucial
blow because it helped Stanford
pull out the contest in the last
inning.
Going into that final inning the
Cardinals were behind 7-4. It

started out with Mark Lucich
grounding out to second base.
Dave Baker walked and Steve
Davis doubled down the left field
line, sending Baker to third. Joe
Lamoure hit a slow hopper to
third baseman Kevin Keating, who
threw the ball into the dirt at first
base giving Lamoure and the
Cardinals a longer life. Baker
scored on the play.
Then, Hannaford doubled to
right field driving in Davis to cut
the margin to one, 7-6. Lamoure
went to third. At this point the
USF coach pulled pitcher Jim
Leone and brought in Ken
Bowman to intentionally walk
designated hitter Gary Morton,
loading the bases.
The next Card to come up was
lead-off hitter Ken Egusa, a junior
college transfer from DeAnza,
who had already gotten two hits
and two walks, lined the third
pitch thrown to him into
centerfield to drive in the tying
and winning runs.
Egusa, who at 5-8 and 175
pounds looks more like a wrestler
than a leftfielder, started his
college career at UCLA but
switched to DeAnza last year
before coming to the Farm this
quarter.
"We're not happy to lose a
game that we were ahead 7-0,"
said Young. "If we had lost the
second game I think it would have
been crushing to the kids."
The doubleheader was used by
the coaching staffs to evaluate
players. Stanford's pitching duties
were split up.
A 1 Arthur started the first
game for the Cardinals. To say he
pitched masterfully would be an

understatement. It would be more
appropriate to say he pitched
"miraculously."
"I was sick as a dog out there
today," said Arthur, the tall
junior righthander has been sick
with a combination of the flu and
a cold.
Arthur pitched four complete
innings, giving up just one hit,
walking one and striking out
three. He only used 50 of his
allotted 60 pitches.
Mike Williamson, who started
the second game for Stanford, was
also stunning as he threw just 27
pitches in three innings. He
allowed only two base runners.
However, the only flaw in the
sophomore righthander's
performance was givijig up a home
run to USF's Gary DeLaqnes.
Other than Arthur and
Williamson, the Stanford mound
corps was very weak, giving up 16
runs in nine innings. "It's going to
get better," said pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "We just need a
little experience in game
situations."
Stanford's pitchers scheduled
for tomorrow are Max Goldstein
and Dave Frost. Arthur and
Williamson may also pitch, if
necessary.
