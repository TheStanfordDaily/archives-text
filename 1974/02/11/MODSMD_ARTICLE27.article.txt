SAN JOSE â€” In these days of $250,000 tournaments, Jack
Nicklaus golf shifts, Johnny Miller sweaters and Chris Schenkel
whispering high above the 18th green, old fashioned head-to-head golf
has been forgotten.
Even college golf has for the most part abandoned dual matches in
favor of huge, medal play tournaments that serve as a training ground
for the pro tour.
But dual matches are not totally obsolete. Friday at San Jose
Country Club, Stanford and San Jose State battled in an old fashioned
head-to-head duel, where the opponent was a person instead of par.
The fact that Stanford won 16-11 won't have any effect on either
team's regional or national ranking. "It doesn't really matter too
much," explained Card junior George Pettinger, "but when you're
playing head-to-head, you sure hate to lose."

Pettinger was one of four
Cardinals who didn't lose as
Stanford coasted to an easy
victory. Pettinger won all three
points in a 73-75 victory over Ken
McMaster and teamed with Tom
Mason to win three more points in
the simultaneous best-ball
competition.
Dave Baskins earned medalist
honors with a two-under par 68 in
his victory over Paul Hahn (73),
while Aly Trompas and Conrad
Nilmeier won their matches with
scores of 69 and 72, respectively.
The only losers for Stanford
were Mason (78) and Brent
Murray, who dropped a 72-75
decision to San Jose freshman
Erik Batten. The Cards picked up
6V2 out of a possible nine points in
the three best-ball matches.
In a freshman match held
Friday at Stanford, the Card frosh
scored a 17V&-9V4 victory over
Diablo College. Stanford's John
Norville was medalist with 78.
Stanford hosts California and
the alumni in a pair of matches
next weekend on the Stanford
course.
