# Radical Economic Theory Has Clouded Future Here
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The future of Marxian economics here remains clouded
after a departmental faculty decision Friday which left
bitterness and confusion among student proponents of
radical economics
Moses Abramovitz, economics department chairman,
announced the faculty decision to a meeting of students
sponsored by Stanford's Union for Radical Political
Economics (URPE). He then left the meeting without
hearing student reaction to the decision.
"We're back to square one," said Jens Christiansen, one
of URPE's leaders. "In three and a half hours of
deliberation [the faculty has] sidestepped [the]
proposals."
Meaning Unclear
The exact meaning of the faculty action, which
extended the program in Alternative Approaches to
Economic Analysis for at least two years, was not clear to
students present.
Alan Warhaftig, a URPE member, commented on the
decision: "We cannot consider this a commitment to a
Marxian economics program," he declared, amidst shouts of
disagreement from fellow students.
In their meeting, the faculty:
— gave comprehensive standing for two years to a
program in Alternative Approaches to Economic Analysis,
allowing Ph.D. candidates to write their dissertations in this

area;
— committed themselves to at least two courses and one
seminar yearly in the field;
— admitted the need for revising the undergraduate
economics curriculum — they recommended expansion of
courses in Marxian economics, the history of economic
thought, and comparative economic systems;
— promised to undertake a search for "an economist
whose teaching interests and research capabilities will lend
strength to the field of Alternative Approaches to
Economic Analysis;
— agreed to appoint a visiting professor in the field until
a qualified candidate for the permanent position can be
found.
No Guarantee
Abramovitz cautioned that the last point does not
guarantee the hiring of a Marxian economist, though he said
many faculty favored the idea.
"The department will need to address itself to this
question again, but the idea that the committee should start
by looking for a person working in Marxian economics was
supported by a considerable portion of the faculty,"
Abramovitz said.
Mike Carter, head of URPE, criticized the decision.
"They have shown no willingness to make this a
permanent program, with no commitment to a second
permanent Marxian economist," he said.
