# Cardinals Drown Los Altos In Circus Swimming Meet
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
In a meet that at times resembled a three-ring
ircus, Stanford outswam Los Altos Aquatic Club
aturday afternoon by a score that even this
eporter isn't sure of: 78'/2 to 33'/2... or something
ke that.
Although no one was paying much attention to
he score, the meet still carried much significance,
he marked improvement shown by several of
Stanford's swimmers gave coach Jim Gaughran a
;ood indication that things are shaping up for the
nICAA'S.
Paul Clark came within four tenths of his
ifetime best in the 400-yard individual medley,
landy Whitchurch recorded his season's best time
n winning the 200 backstroke. Dave Fryefield did
lis season's best time in the 200 fly and Jeff
Leicher dropped his 500 freestyle time 10 seconds
rom what it was two weeks ago.
Two swimmers from Los Altos displayed some
jreat individual performances in the distances. Mike
Johnson and Richard Thorton placed one-two in
joth the 1650 and the 500. Johnson took the 1650
n 16:13.0 and the 500 in 4:45.1. Thorton finished

the races in 16:18.8 and 4:47.4 — pretty good
times for high schoolers.
Saturday's encounter wasn't a standard dual
meet. The 1650 and 400 individual medley
replaced the 1000 and the 200 individual medley in
order to give swimmers an opportunity to qualify
in those events for the NCAA's.
Between events, Stanford's women swimmers
attempted to qualify for their nationals. The
women qualified in nine events, led by Vicki Hays,
who qualified in five.
Yet it seems inevitable that the only reason
anyone will remember this meet is because of the
meets it precedes. This weekend, the Cards travel
south to take on USC and UCLA. The Trojans are
ranked second in the nation while the Bruins are
third.
While defeating SC may be next to impossible,
Stanford has a great shot at UCLA. If the Cards
take the key events from the Bruins like they did
against Washington earlier this year, the meet
should be in the bag.
The team confidence was reflected by
distance-ace Terry Sutton, "We'll win. That's why
we're going down there."

Two swimmers from Los Altos displayed some
jreat individual performances in the distances. Mike
Johnson and Richard Thorton placed one-two in
joth the 1650 and the 500. Johnson took the 1650
n 16:13.0 and the 500 in 4:45.1. Thorton finished

the races in 16:18.8 and 4:47.4 — pretty good
times for high schoolers.
Saturday's encounter wasn't a standard dual
meet. The 1650 and 400 individual medley
replaced the 1000 and the 200 individual medley in
order to give swimmers an opportunity to qualify
in those events for the NCAA's.
Between events, Stanford's women swimmers
attempted to qualify for their nationals. The
women qualified in nine events, led by Vicki Hays,
who qualified in five.
Yet it seems inevitable that the only reason
anyone will remember this meet is because of the
meets it precedes. This weekend, the Cards travel
south to take on USC and UCLA. The Trojans are
ranked second in the nation while the Bruins are
third.
While defeating SC may be next to impossible,
Stanford has a great shot at UCLA. If the Cards
take the key events from the Bruins like they did
against Washington earlier this year, the meet
should be in the bag.
The team confidence was reflected by
distance-ace Terry Sutton, "We'll win. That's why
we're going down there."
In a meet that at times resembled a three-ring
ircus, Stanford outswam Los Altos Aquatic Club
aturday afternoon by a score that even this
eporter isn't sure of: 78'/2 to 33'/2... or something
ke that.
Although no one was paying much attention to
he score, the meet still carried much significance,
he marked improvement shown by several of
Stanford's swimmers gave coach Jim Gaughran a
;ood indication that things are shaping up for the
nICAA'S.
Paul Clark came within four tenths of his
ifetime best in the 400-yard individual medley,
landy Whitchurch recorded his season's best time
n winning the 200 backstroke. Dave Fryefield did
lis season's best time in the 200 fly and Jeff
Leicher dropped his 500 freestyle time 10 seconds
rom what it was two weeks ago.
