Stanford came out in the first
period with some great lineouts.
The Card second line controlled
the early going, but it was a
frustrating half for both teams
with many missed scoring
opportunities.
The BATS' Kip Oxinan missed
the first scoring chance, muffing a
40-yard penalty kick. Oxman,
who had missed only four penalty
kicks in seven games, missed five
Saturday.
The Cards, after Oxman's
muffed kick, scored their only try
of the day. Lawry Lieberman

started the break, passing to
Marty O'Donohue. O'Donohue
flipped the ball to Forrie Martin
for the try and Lieberman added
the extra point to give the Cards a
6-0 lead.
But the BATS marched right
back with Oxman scoring on a
25-yard try. Oxman converted the
extra point to knot the score at
6-6.
Neither team was able to
advance the ball until late in the
first period with great defensive
kicking dominating the stanza.
Stanford scored late in the
period, with Lieberman booting a
45-yard penalty kick, his longest
of the year. The BATS came right
back after Stanford was called for
failing to retreat. Oxman made a
25-yard penalty kick to make it

9-9 at halftime.
The BATS' Chuck Williams
opened the second period by
scoring an unconverted try, which
proved to be the margin of victory
for the BATS. The score came on
the last play of a fine goal line
stand by the Cards.
Stanford had one more scoring
opportunity in the game, but
O'Donohue was stopped three
feet short of the goal.
Gordy Riegel had another great
defensive effort, exhibiting some
fine hitting.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
said, "it was a game that could
have gone either way. The BATS
are a fine team but they aren't
great."
BATS general manager A 1 Moss
called the Cards "the best team
we've played all year."
The Bay Area Touring Side
handed Stanford's rugby team its
first loss of the year Saturday,
defeating the Cards 13-9, on
Harry Maloney Field. The win
gave the BATS sole possession of
first place in the Northern
California Rugby Union standings,
with a perfect 8-0 mark. Stanford
is now 4-1.
