# Injured Matmen Lose Twice
## 
### STEVE SOULE 
Stanford's injury-ridden
wrestling team dropped both
halves of a double dual meet at
San Francisco State Saturday,
losing to UC-Davis 28-15 and the
host Gators 27-21.
According to coach Joe De
Meo, "both matches could've
gone either way, but we just got

some bad breaks. The final scores
are surprising, as we figured that
SF State would be stronger."
De Meo said Stanford could
have beaten the Gators if Jim
Tatarakis, ahead 9-3 in the third
period, hadn't been pinned. "If he
had won a decision, we probably
would've beaten them."
The Cardinals dominated the

upper weights, as Marc Frelier
(177), Roy Tolles(190) and Chris
Westersund (Hwt.) all won twice.
De Meo noted their outstanding
performances, and also praised
Tatarakis (126), Mark Yancey
(134) and Charlie Masch (150).
"1 think Tatarakis' match was
definitely one of the crucial
points. He was doing a wonderful
job against a good wrestler, just
whipping him for eight minutes,
and then got turned over and
pinned. It sometimes affects the
rest of the kids when something
like that happens," De Meo said.
"Yancey's probably been our
best wrestler over the course of
the whole season. He was upset by
the guy from Davis, but went out
on one good leg and one good arm
and beat his opponent from SF
State. As for Masch, he weighed in
at 161 the day of the match, and
had to spend 3'/2 hours in the
steam bath to cut 11 pounds to
get down to his wrestling weight
of 150. When he went out to
wrestle, he just didn't have
anything left."
Stanford has been hampered
by injuries all season, and
Saturday's match was no
exception. Jim Rappaport (142)
was hurt in Friday's practice, and
the Cards had to forfeit at that
weight to both teams.
In fact, Stanford is now
wrestling without six of its
original 10 starters. De Meo says,
"I'm not trying to take anything
away from the kids, but we just
don't have the depth. And when
you lose six of your top 10, you
just can't do it."
Stanford is now 6-9-1 on the
season.
