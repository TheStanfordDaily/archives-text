# Shuffling The Cards
## Race Tightens 
### Dave Robinson 
Inconsistent in December and awful in January, Stanford's
devastating February performances have caused optimistic fans and
sportswriters to re-evaluate the long-dismissed possibility of a second
place finish in the Pacific Eight basketball standings.
The resurgent Cardinals soundly defeated Washington and
Washington State this weekend to climb all the way from a tie for last
to undisputed possession of fourth place. Meanwhile, Oregon's bubble
finally burst in Los Angeles, leaving the Ducks and USC tied for
second at 5-2. Stanford is 3-4.
Those facts haven't exactly caused athletic department business
manager Pat Davis to frantically make hotel and business
arrangements for a post-season tournament, but the possibility
definitely exists.
If Stanford can win six of its remaining games and USC and Oregon
each lost at least three times (once to Stanford, once to UCLA and
once to each other or a helpful second division team), the Cards could
tie for second.
Card coach Howie Dallmar, however, remains realistically cautious.
"From now on it gets tougher," said Dallmar. "Five of our last seven
games are on the road, and the two home games are against UCLA and
USC."
Faint Hopes
So don't get your hopes up. If Stanford did continue its amazing
hot streak, however, the following occurrences would determine
whether the Cards would be invited to participate in a post-season
tournament:
The second place team (or any teams that tie for second) are
automatically under consideration for a berth in the first Collegiate
Commissioner's Tournament, an eight-team affair scheduled for St.
Louis on March 14-18. Ten conferences are under contract to the
tournament (every major league except the Atlantic Coast
Conference), which means that 10 or more runners-up would be
considered for the eight tournament spots.
A three-man committee would then choose the eight
representatives, presumably on the basis of overall record and relative
strength of the conferences. If a Pac-8 team is selected (which seems
inevitable), that team would have to accept the invitation or not play
in any post-season event.
Assuming the chosen team accepts, other Pac-8 teams would be
eligible to accept invitations to play in the NIT in New York.

Sports information director Bob Murphy, as part of his
never-ending battle to upgrade the image of every aspect of Stanford
athletics, embarked on an important expedition Saturday afternoon
before the basketball game.
Murphy, incensed by an article in the current issue of Sports
Illustrated that questioned the attractiveness of Stanford's female
sports fans, toured the baseball, rugby and swimming events in search
of beautiful spectators.
The Sports Illustrated article concerned ABC-TV's "honey shots,"
quick camera glimpses of girls in the stands which have become as
much a part of ABC telecasts as Chris Schenkel's references to apple
pie.
Sidaris Responsible
The man responsible for the honey shots is Andy Sidaris, who
recently aired his views on the subject to Don Freeman of the San
Diego Union.
Sidaris lauded the girls at Alabama and Southern California, but
criticized Wisconsin ("the girls get their hardo hints from Field and
Stream"), Minnesota ("the style is Early Lumberjack") and Michigan
("the girls dress like old Joan Crawford movies.")
But Sidaris' criticism of Stanford was particularly harsh. "Stanford
is no place for honey shots," he said. "There we concentrate on the
game. All we found were girls dressed in a style I can only describe as
Early War of 1812. Is there a shortage of hairbrushes at Stanford?"
Murphy, who had a photographer accompany him on Saturday's
jaunt through the stands, insists the project was a success. He plans to
send pictures of "at least 10 of the top honeys" to Sidaris first thing
this morning.
