# Non-Starter Moroski Shines Again
## Surprising JV Wins Two More 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Stanford's junior varsity parlayed the right
combination of emotion and a lack of it to
score victories over North Peralta College,
100-98, and UC-Santa Cruz, 86-71, over the
weekend at Maples.
With the devastating duo of Marty
Moroski and Sven Walker reaching new
heights of heroism, Billy Jones' cagers (you
know, the ones who weren't going to win a
single game) improved their record to a
shocking 7-5.
Moroski proved a savior twice during
Friday night's thriller over Peralta, saving the
Cards from defeat in regulation with a
fall-away jumper at 0:06, then slipping in
from behind the basket to score the winning
hoop with two seconds left in the overtime.
Of his game-saving fall-away, "Mo" said,
"I put it up with a prayer. I could just have
well have been the goat." Goat he wasn't,
though when asked how he felt to be the
hero, the easygoing Moroski was pre-empteed
by assistant coach Bob Buell. "He feels lucky
— that's how," said Buell, who directed the
team that night in Jones' absence.
Moroski himself credited the victory to a
"great effort" by the squad. Indeed, this was
a night when the normally nonchalant JV got
itself together emotionally.
"We won — what can you say," said Buell,
who survived an acid-test of his coaching
strength. Buell was forced to compensate for
a first-half stretch when his team went from a
29-24 lead to a 41-31 deficit, ignore a
technical foul for having six men on the
court, and survive a tension-filled final 10
minutes during which Stanford's 96-91
advantage was the only lead on the
scoreboard greater than three points.
Disastrous Zone
Poor shooting in close by the Peraltans
had allowed Stanford its early lead, but Buell
decided his man-to-man defense wasn't
performing adequately. The zone he
substituted proved disastrous.
"It allows better match-ups for screening
out," Buell said of the zone. "But we weren't
steppin' in front. They were killin' us on the
offensive boards.
"Things started to get away from u«," he
continued. "Normally we're a running team
but it got away from us tonight." Before
Stanford could catch "it"the Cards had been
blitzed, had lost the ball on steals at
mid-court repeatedly, and trailed by 16 at
the half.
Was Stanford ill-suited for a run-and-gun

game like the visitors from Oakland had
initiated? "I would have thought so," said
Buell. "But after that first half, I'm not so
sure. I thought we could have kept our poise
better than we did." So Buell decided to
instill a little poise at the half — or else.
"We got back to basics," the coach said.
"Just like a drill — anyone who gets tips
(scored over him] goes out. I told them, 'if
you start to dribble too much, you're coming
out!" Come out they did, as Buell made
massive substitutions, but the transients go' ,
the message, and caught fire.
Buell reinstated the man-to-man defense,
and it began to force Peralta into turnovers.
Offensively, the tempo changed, too.
"fScott] Russell (17 rebounds, 19 points)
came off his duff and did a hell of a job,"
said Buell of his 6-8 center, who displayed a
rare hook shot at 13:25 which brought the
Card comeback within two, 61-59.
Poor Defense
Stanford fought to stay close as time
whittled away. Peralta was "a little bit quick
for us" and "could jump quite well compared
to us," Buell said, but had "not that good of
a defense" and Stanford found scoring fairly
easy.
Walker, boosted by the übiquitous
banners of "Sven's Men," was admirable in
the clutch once again, and scored a go-ahead
hoop with two minutes left. The Cards lost
their lead when Peralta's Larry Coleman
made five straight free throws in the last
1:15. Coleman missed his final charity toss at
91-89, however, making way for Moroski's
game-saver.
Buell described the set-up for Moroski's
shot. "We ran a post screen at the end, with
Moroski off the double. We had tried it
earlier, and they were giving him zero
defense. [Terry] McCartin made the right

decision, giving the ball to him."
At the break before the three-minute
overtime, Buell told his team, "Hell, this
game's ours." He did caution the Cards to
"take better shots."
They did, and moved up 96-91. But Mike
Smith, who scored 38 for Peralta, managed
to muscle in for a basket to make the score
96-95, and a foul shot tied the game. Russell
scored at 0:45, Coleman answered him at
0:23, and then Stanford benefitted from
what Buell called "a little luck."
Stanford's bench yelled for a time-out for
11 seconds, Buell says, but the cries fell upon
deaf ears. With two seconds left, a prayer was
made ... and answered.
Motley Bunch
Emotionally drained, the Cardinals were
back on the Maples floor at noon the next
day to meet a motley bunch from Santa
Cruz. Looks proved deceptive, though, and
Stanford trailed, 30-20, with 6:07 left in the
first half.
"We were not sharp today," said Jones,
back in the saddle after a scouting mission in
Berkeley the night before. He called the
letdown "a typical response" and said if
Saturday's meeting "had been a night game
we would have had time to get mentally
ready."
To break the lethargy, Jones implemented
a zone press which "definitely saved us" and
forced USSC into turnovers, leading to a
39-37 Stanford advantage at the half.
Santa Cruz refused to fold and was down
just 60-59 with 10:27 left. "They shot well,"
said Jones. "They're not a bad ball club.
When you press you gotta give up something.
They were gettin' a lot of shots." And
shooting .500 from the floor.
But, in a time out at the 10-minute mark,
Jones told his cagers "what I always tell
them, 'take your time and hustle.' "
The seemingly paradoxical advice proved
effective again — Stanford moved out and
was never challenged subsequently.
Moroski led the Card scoring again (27
points for the third time this season) and
Walker had a season high of 26, much to the
delight of his boisterous rooters.
Stanford had another high offensive
production. "They're fallin' now," said Jones
of his team's shots. "Sven gets a lot of second
and third shots."
And a non-starter named Moroski gets a
few prayers.
