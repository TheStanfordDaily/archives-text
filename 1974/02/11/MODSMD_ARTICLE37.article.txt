# Unselfish Kelley Demoralizes Huskies
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Washington coach Marv
Harshman summed it up pretty
well. "Nobody on the West Coast
besides [Bill] Walton is as good as
Rich Kelley. I've said that since he
was a freshman."
Howie Dallmar agreed. "Kelley
demoralized them," he said after
Stanford had thrashed the Huskies
88-68 Friday night at Maples
Pavilion. "If he hadn't been so
unselfish he could have scored
50."
Unselfish as he was, the agile
postman almost scored 50
anyway. Kelley started his scoring
assault early, collecting 24 first
half points, including the last
seven in the period. And when the

smoke had cleared the stellar
seven-footer had poured in a
career-high 32 points and grabbed
17 rebounds to lead Stanford to
its third lopsided victory in a row.
Kelley scored several of his
buckets while leading the fast
break, an unusual position for a
man of his stature.
But with 6-BV2 Ed Schweitzer
and 6-11 Tim Patterson jamming
things up in the middle, Kelley
found himself free to assume the
guard's role. He apparently liked
thy new position, scoring several
cheap buckets with the aid of
perfectly executed passes from
junior guard Melvin Arterberry.
Arterberry Steady
Arterberry played his third

steady game in a row, collecting
six points, six rebounds and most
importantly, seven assists, high for
the game.
A short jumper by Kelley with
10:52 to go in the first half put
the Cards on top 17-15 and gave
them the lead for good. With less
than two minutes to go Kelley put
on his one-man show, scoring the
half's last seven points and giving
the Cards a 42-30 halftime bulge.
Goals by Kelley and
Schweitzer and three buckets by
Patterson gave the Cards a 50-30
lead and turned the game into a
rout.
"That was by far our best
game," said Kelley of a team
which had demolished Denver
108-66 two weeks earlier and
waltzed by Cal 71-53 the week
before. Senior point man Jim
Montague, who is improving with
every outing, agreed.
"Everything's going just great."
Montague was a starter at the
beginning of the season, but has
only recently regained his starting
spot. "I had a talk with myself,"
he said. "I said to myself â€” I'm
not playing my game. Now I'm
playing with a lot more
confidence."
'Better Than SC'
"I always felt that Stanford
was a good basketball team,"
commented Harshman. "I still
think they're better than
Southern Cal." Harshman doesn't
have as much faith in his own
squad. "We're not a good
defensive team," he said. "We
have to shoot over 50 percent to
win."
The Huskies fell far short of
that mark, connecting on only 30
of 85 attempts for .353, and only
eight of 21 from the free throw
line. Stanford was 35 for 69 from
the floor for .507, and just as
importantly, held a 56-43 margin
on the boards.
As usual, Kelley's 17 caroms
led all rebounders, and the ones
he happened to miss were picked
up by Schweitzer (14), Patterson
(7) and Arterberry (6).
"Offense is an instinctive
thing," said Kelley, indicating he
wasn't really aware of his scoring
totals. "You just play it by ear."
It's obvious the Cards'
'instincts' are getting better, but
Stanford will need successful road
trips to the Northwest in the next
two weeks if they are to challenge
for second or third in the
conference.

Cardinal Notes: Kelley, who
has been plagued by foul trouble
this season, didn't collect a
personal until 35 minutes had
elapsed and the game was out of
reach.... The victory was
Stanford's third straight over the
Huskies .... Mike Simons scored
three quick baskets late in the
game.
Stanford's statisticians,
possibly intimidated by criticism
from several guards (most notably
Jim Montague), credited the Cards
with a season-high 21 assists....
