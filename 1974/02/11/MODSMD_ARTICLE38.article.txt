# Cards Win Twice, Escape Pac-8 Second Division
## Stanford Wins Fourth Straight In Lackluster TV Performance 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The sharp ballhandling and
fancy passes which drove Maples
Pavilion fans wild during the first
three games of Stanford's current
winning streak were
conspicuously absent Saturday
afternoon. So were the fans, as
only 2939 chose to avoid the
sunshine and watch the Cardinals
win their fourth in a row, 65-51
over Washington State.
Stanford committed two dozen
turnovers during the contest, but
it didn't really matter because the
Cougars, without star 6-ll l / 2
center Steve Puidokas, couldn't
get inside.
Puidokas, out with a fractured
cheekbone, may or may not be
back in the lineup next week,
when the Cards play at Pullman.
And if he doesn't have a starting
berth, it may be another long
game for WSU, which was stymied
by Stanford's aggressive zone
defense.
Most of the Cougars didn't do
anything offensively Saturday, as
evidenced by the fact that only
one player scored more than seven
points.
Barnhill Ballyhooed
That one, Norton Barnhill, was
fantastic. Ineligible until this
weekend, he came off the bench
for 22 against Cal and 23 against
the Cards Saturday, despite being
sick.
"Barnhill was something for a
guy who just started playing
yesterday," Card coach Howie
Dallmar said of the 6-4
sophomore who drives as
aggressively as Gene Hackman.
"Billy [Jones] scouted the game
Friday night and compared him to

| North Carolina State star| David
Thompson."
Enough for Barnhill, except to
say that Stanford outscored WSU
20-4 when he wasn't in the game,
which gives you some idea of how
badly the rest of the Cougars
played. The best execution they
showed all day was during a flashy
warmup drill.
Afternoon Alibi
"You don't see too many good
afternoon games when both teams
play Friday night," Dallmar
understated. But despite the
turnovers and 21 fouls, Stanford
did do something right during the
matinee, as the Cards hit the .500
mark for the first time in five
weeks. Stanford is 9-9 on the
year, and in sole possession of
fourth place in the Pacific Eight
with a 3-4 record.
"We figured they'd shoot well,
play a good zone and be tough on
the boards — and they were,"
WSU coach George Raveling said.
The latter two analyses were
definitely true. Rich Kelley
continued to dominate the post,
grabbing 16 rebounds. Tim
Patterson, rapidly improving as a
rebounder, had nine caroms while
Melvin Arterberry, positioning
himself well, grabbed eight.
AH Raveled Up
As for playing a good zone,
Stanford was reveling until
Raveling took advantage of two
TV timeouts to unravel it. WSU
scored only one point until there
was 12:21 to play in the first half.
Arterberry, as usual, played a
superb floor game, and Ed
Schweitzer and Kelley didn't let
anyone inside during the first five
minutes of each half, when

Stanford outscored Washington
State 18-0.
Raveling's analysis of "good
shooting" as a reason for his
team's demise is a bit
questionable, as Stanford didn't
score that much, and most of
Kelley's team-leading 19 points
were from inside.
However, both Patterson and
Mark Gilberg hit around 50
percent from the outside. Gilberg,
scoring a season-high 11 points,
also handled the ball well and
played good defense in his best
game of the year.
Only five Stanford players
scored. Besides Kelley and
Gilberg, Patterson had 14,
Schweitzer 13 and Arterberry
eight.
Way To Beat Press
The Cougars defensive strategy
of pressing after every basket and
then sagging on the Cards' big
men worked fairly well.
Stanford did find a good
method of beating the press,
however; inbounding the ball with
high passes to Kelley, the only
person on the floor tall enough to
catch them, and letting him toss it
across the 10-second line.
WSU threatened to threaten
with about five minutes left in the
game, when they trailed by only
nine points due to a rash of
Stanford fouls. But the Cards
worked their delay offense well
enough to forestall any real
danger.
* * *
Cardinal Notes: Kelley
achieved a season-long goal when
he made a technical foul shot
caused by WSU's having six men
on the court.... Gilberg later
made a technical among five
straight free throws, none of
which touched the
rim.... Kelley was named
television player of the week by
the TVS broadcasting crew.

20-4 when he wasn't in the game,
which gives you some idea of how
badly the rest of the Cougars
played. The best execution they
showed all day was during a flashy
warmup drill.
Afternoon Alibi
"You don't see too many good
afternoon games when both teams
play Friday night," Dallmar
understated. But despite the
turnovers and 21 fouls, Stanford
did do something right during the
matinee, as the Cards hit the .500
mark for the first time in five
weeks. Stanford is 9-9 on the
year, and in sole possession of
fourth place in the Pacific Eight
with a 3-4 record.
"We figured they'd shoot well,
play a good zone and be tough on
the boards — and they were,"
WSU coach George Raveling said.
The latter two analyses were
definitely true. Rich Kelley
continued to dominate the post,
grabbing 16 rebounds. Tim
Patterson, rapidly improving as a
rebounder, had nine caroms while
Melvin Arterberry, positioning
himself well, grabbed eight.
AH Raveled Up
As for playing a good zone,
Stanford was reveling until
Raveling took advantage of two
TV timeouts to unravel it. WSU
scored only one point until there
was 12:21 to play in the first half.
Arterberry, as usual, played a
superb floor game, and Ed
Schweitzer and Kelley didn't let
anyone inside during the first five
minutes of each half, when

Stanford outscored Washington
State 18-0.
Raveling's analysis of "good
shooting" as a reason for his
team's demise is a bit
questionable, as Stanford didn't
score that much, and most of
Kelley's team-leading 19 points
were from inside.
However, both Patterson and
Mark Gilberg hit around 50
percent from the outside. Gilberg,
scoring a season-high 11 points,
also handled the ball well and
played good defense in his best
game of the year.
Only five Stanford players
scored. Besides Kelley and
Gilberg, Patterson had 14,
Schweitzer 13 and Arterberry
eight.
Way To Beat Press
The Cougars defensive strategy
of pressing after every basket and
then sagging on the Cards' big
men worked fairly well.
Stanford did find a good
method of beating the press,
however; inbounding the ball with
high passes to Kelley, the only
person on the floor tall enough to
catch them, and letting him toss it
across the 10-second line.
WSU threatened to threaten
with about five minutes left in the
game, when they trailed by only
nine points due to a rash of
Stanford fouls. But the Cards
worked their delay offense well
enough to forestall any real
danger.
* * *
Cardinal Notes: Kelley
achieved a season-long goal when
he made a technical foul shot
caused by WSU's having six men
on the court.... Gilberg later
made a technical among five
straight free throws, none of
which touched the
rim.... Kelley was named
television player of the week by
the TVS broadcasting crew.

LEADNG THE BREAK—Seven-foot center Rich Kelley scores on a
fast break lay up Friday night against Washington. Kelley scored a
career-high 32 points in the 88-68 victory.
The sharp ballhandling and
fancy passes which drove Maples
Pavilion fans wild during the first
three games of Stanford's current
winning streak were
conspicuously absent Saturday
afternoon. So were the fans, as
only 2939 chose to avoid the
sunshine and watch the Cardinals
win their fourth in a row, 65-51
over Washington State.
Stanford committed two dozen
turnovers during the contest, but
it didn't really matter because the
Cougars, without star 6-ll l / 2
center Steve Puidokas, couldn't
get inside.
Puidokas, out with a fractured
cheekbone, may or may not be
back in the lineup next week,
when the Cards play at Pullman.
And if he doesn't have a starting
berth, it may be another long
game for WSU, which was stymied
by Stanford's aggressive zone
defense.
Most of the Cougars didn't do
anything offensively Saturday, as
evidenced by the fact that only
one player scored more than seven
points.
Barnhill Ballyhooed
That one, Norton Barnhill, was
fantastic. Ineligible until this
weekend, he came off the bench
for 22 against Cal and 23 against
the Cards Saturday, despite being
sick.
"Barnhill was something for a
guy who just started playing
yesterday," Card coach Howie
Dallmar said of the 6-4
sophomore who drives as
aggressively as Gene Hackman.
"Billy [Jones] scouted the game
Friday night and compared him to

| North Carolina State star| David
Thompson."

Kelley's team-leading 19 points
were from inside.
However, both Patterson and
Mark Gilberg hit around 50
percent from the outside. Gilberg,
scoring a season-high 11 points,
also handled the ball well and
played good defense in his best
game of the year.
Only five Stanford players
scored. Besides Kelley and
Gilberg, Patterson had 14,
Schweitzer 13 and Arterberry
eight.
Way To Beat Press
The Cougars defensive strategy
of pressing after every basket and
then sagging on the Cards' big
men worked fairly well.
Stanford did find a good
method of beating the press,
however; inbounding the ball with
high passes to Kelley, the only
person on the floor tall enough to
catch them, and letting him toss it
across the 10-second line.
WSU threatened to threaten
with about five minutes left in the
game, when they trailed by only
nine points due to a rash of
Stanford fouls. But the Cards
worked their delay offense well
enough to forestall any real
danger.

Cardinal Notes: Kelley
achieved a season-long goal when
he made a technical foul shot
caused by WSU's having six men
on the court.... Gilberg later
made a technical among five
straight free throws, none of
which touched the
rim.... Kelley was named
television player of the week by
the TVS broadcasting crew.

LEADNG THE BREAK—Seven-foot center Rich Kelley scores on a
fast break lay up Friday night against Washington. Kelley scored a
career-high 32 points in the 88-68 victory.
The sharp ballhandling and
fancy passes which drove Maples
Pavilion fans wild during the first
three games of Stanford's current
winning streak were
conspicuously absent Saturday
afternoon. So were the fans, as
only 2939 chose to avoid the
sunshine and watch the Cardinals
win their fourth in a row, 65-51
over Washington State.
Stanford committed two dozen
turnovers during the contest, but
it didn't really matter because the
Cougars, without star 6-ll l / 2
center Steve Puidokas, couldn't
get inside.
Puidokas, out with a fractured
cheekbone, may or may not be
back in the lineup next week,
when the Cards play at Pullman.
And if he doesn't have a starting
berth, it may be another long
game for WSU, which was stymied
by Stanford's aggressive zone
defense.
Most of the Cougars didn't do
anything offensively Saturday, as
evidenced by the fact that only
one player scored more than seven
points.
Barnhill Ballyhooed
That one, Norton Barnhill, was
fantastic. Ineligible until this
weekend, he came off the bench
for 22 against Cal and 23 against
the Cards Saturday, despite being
sick.
"Barnhill was something for a
guy who just started playing
yesterday," Card coach Howie
Dallmar said of the 6-4
sophomore who drives as
aggressively as Gene Hackman.
"Billy [Jones] scouted the game
Friday night and compared him to

| North Carolina State star| David
Thompson."
Enough for Barnhill, except to
say that Stanford outscored WSU
20-4 when he wasn't in the game,
which gives you some idea of how
badly the rest of the Cougars
played. The best execution they
showed all day was during a flashy
warmup drill.
Afternoon Alibi
"You don't see too many good
afternoon games when both teams
play Friday night," Dallmar
understated. But despite the
turnovers and 21 fouls, Stanford
did do something right during the
matinee, as the Cards hit the .500
mark for the first time in five
weeks. Stanford is 9-9 on the
year, and in sole possession of
fourth place in the Pacific Eight
with a 3-4 record.
"We figured they'd shoot well,
play a good zone and be tough on
the boards — and they were,"
WSU coach George Raveling said.
The latter two analyses were
definitely true. Rich Kelley
continued to dominate the post,
grabbing 16 rebounds. Tim
Patterson, rapidly improving as a
rebounder, had nine caroms while
Melvin Arterberry, positioning
himself well, grabbed eight.
AH Raveled Up
As for playing a good zone,
Stanford was reveling until
Raveling took advantage of two
TV timeouts to unravel it. WSU
scored only one point until there
was 12:21 to play in the first half.
Arterberry, as usual, played a
superb floor game, and Ed
Schweitzer and Kelley didn't let
anyone inside during the first five
minutes of each half, when

Stanford outscored Washington
State 18-0.
Raveling's analysis of "good
shooting" as a reason for his
team's demise is a bit
questionable, as Stanford didn't
score that much, and most of
Kelley's team-leading 19 points
were from inside.
However, both Patterson and
Mark Gilberg hit around 50
percent from the outside. Gilberg,
