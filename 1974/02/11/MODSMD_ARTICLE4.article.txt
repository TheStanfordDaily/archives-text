# Anatomy Class Dissections
## Cadavers Confront Med Students 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
"You can tell a first year med
student by his smell," admits one such
student who showers twice a day and
slathers himself with hand lotion to
keep from reeking of formaldehyde.
Visions of his human cadaver linger
along with this unmistakable, often
irritating, odor.
Most of the students who initially
were bothered by the cadavers issued
them in anatomy class this quarter feel
quite comfortable by now. Those who
donned rubber gloves and moved
gingerly during their first few weeks,
now "just dive on in," as one student
put it.
Many wear special clothes —
ranging from railroad overalls to the
conventional lab coat. They change
into them as they might a gym suit to
keep the persistent odor from
following them around campus.
Adjustment
"One student says forthrightly,
"There is an odor, but you very
quickly adjust to it. It's like working
anywhere with lots of noise or a

strange smell. You learn to associate it
with the job. That's all."
Another med student recalls, "It
bothered me the first week when I
would have to peel an orange with my
hands afterwards." Now she eats her
lunch without giving the cadaver a
thought.
"When I used to throw pots, I'd
have little bits of clay underneath my
fingernails, and now that I'm
dissecting, I have bits of bodies under
my nails. But it doesn't bother me. It
did the first week," she recalls.
Wild Imagination
"It's not as bad as you would
imagine," another student points out.
Certainly, the imagination will run
wild as the on looker peruses the
outside of the buff-colored anatomy
building with its painted-out windows.
Dating back almost 70 years, the grave
structure stands in pronounced
contrast to the sparkling Medical
Center across the street.
Once inside the dissecting rooms,
the sunshine and a breeze filter
through the translucent windows.

open just a crack. Two dozen cadavers
rest peacefully upon drainboards.
"They're far removed from life,"
says one student of physical therapy.
"They're dull, cold gray." A medical
student adds, "They're definitely
muscular, like old steak. They have no
color; they're not red and bloody."
The cadaver is flesh, not human. It
is only a number, unless the student
gives it a name. It has no past — or if it
does, the student may find his task
unbearable. For example, one physical
therapy student says his first cadaver
was a ten-year-old boy, for whom a
girl in his section had babysat. She
stopped attending labs.
Usually, one limb at a time is
unwrapped for dissection. Med
students in this quarter's anatomy
class have not yet unveiled the face of
their cadaver. "The head makes it
human again," one student says.
And the cadavers were, of course,
once human. While they lived. Dr.
Donald Gray, in charge of anatomical
gifts for 42 years until last September,
had limited contact with most of the

donors. Generally middle-aged, these
people came from all socioeconomic
backgrounds, says Gray. Almost 2000
bodies have passed through the
anatomy department since 1940 at an
average rate of 50 per year.
In recent years, each donor has
been asked to fill out a simple form
legally releasing his body after death
to the Stanford Medical Center for
research and teaching purposes.
Large Supply
For many years, the department
was supplied with the bodies of
indigents from state institutions. Since
1960, there has been a tremendous
increase in persons willing their bodies
to science.
To control the influx, the
department has restricted its
acceptance to those dying within a
30-mile radius of Stanford.
"We will pick up a body and handle
it completely (free of charge)," says
anatomical technician and embalmer
John Dolph.
Within 24 hours after death, the
bodies are embalmed, and then stored
in vats of light mineral oil in the
building's basement.
"We can store them almost
indefinitely — up to three years," says
Gray. "But we have only so much
space .. . enough to store about 50
bodies comfortably."
4000 Donors
The building can accommodate no
more than 75 per year. Presently, the
department has the names of about
4000 prospective donors on file. "We
don't have the vaguest idea how many
people who signed the forms will
eventually come in [dead]. . . . Once
the people sign, we feel a moral
commitment to take them when they
die," says Gray.
Donors cite different reasons for
making the gift. "Most everybody has
idealistic motivations," Gray
generalizes. "They want to help

science."
He will avoid the emotional and
financial burden of a funeral service.
"The whole thing [service] smacks of
sentimentality," he says bluntly.
"Funerals are an attempt to avoid
the idea of finality."
In the dissecting room, all is final.
When students have finished their
study after two quarters of class, the
remains are cremated.
Cadavers Well Treated
Before the students began
dissecting this quarter, they were
urged to treat their cadavers with due
respect. There have been no instances
of abuse, reports Gray, but other
schools do not have such clean slates.
Gray recalls a cruel prank at the
University of Washington. "One
morning we missed a whole body, and
we got a frantic call at noon from the
police that there was a body hanging
by the neck from the fire escape of the

liberal arts building." The culprits had
dressed him in a pair of sailor
dungarees.
At Stanford the department
imposes strict security to prevent
abuse.
"The disappearance of a body or a
part would be an awful thing and
terrible public relations," Gray says.
As Dolph puts it, "It's extremely
critical that people donate these
bodies. It's sort of like you can't have
a guy repairing your car unless he's
seen the inside of one before." A
medical student explains, "It would be
like studying physical diagnosis
without a patient. It's clearly crucial."
Asked if he plans to donate his
own, the student responds in mild
confusion, "That's a question I haven't
figured out how to answer." Dolph
may know best. "These students are
more oriented toward saving life and
living, not death," he says.
"You can tell a first year med
student by his smell," admits one such
student who showers twice a day and
slathers himself with hand lotion to

part would be an awful thing and
terrible public relations," Gray says.
As Dolph puts it, "It's extremely
critical that people donate these
bodies. It's sort of like you can't have
a guy repairing your car unless he's
seen the inside of one before." A
medical student explains, "It would be
like studying physical diagnosis
without a patient. It's clearly crucial."
Asked if he plans to donate his
own, the student responds in mild
confusion, "That's a question I haven't
figured out how to answer." Dolph
may know best. "These students are
more oriented toward saving life and
living, not death," he says.
"You can tell a first year med
student by his smell," admits one such
student who showers twice a day and
slathers himself with hand lotion to
keep from reeking of formaldehyde.
Visions of his human cadaver linger
along with this unmistakable, often
irritating, odor.
Most of the students who initially
were bothered by the cadavers issued
them in anatomy class this quarter feel
quite comfortable by now. Those who
donned rubber gloves and moved
gingerly during their first few weeks,
now "just dive on in," as one student
put it.
Many wear special clothes —
ranging from railroad overalls to the
conventional lab coat. They change
into them as they might a gym suit to
keep the persistent odor from
following them around campus.
Adjustment
"One student says forthrightly,
"There is an odor, but you very
quickly adjust to it. It's like working
anywhere with lots of noise or a

strange smell. You learn to associate it
with the job. That's all."
Another med student recalls, "It
bothered me the first week when I
would have to peel an orange with my
hands afterwards." Now she eats her
lunch without giving the cadaver a
thought.
"When I used to throw pots, I'd
have little bits of clay underneath my
fingernails, and now that I'm
dissecting, I have bits of bodies under
my nails. But it doesn't bother me. It
did the first week," she recalls.
Wild Imagination
"It's not as bad as you would
imagine," another student points out.
Certainly, the imagination will run
wild as the on looker peruses the
outside of the buff-colored anatomy
building with its painted-out windows.
Dating back almost 70 years, the grave
structure stands in pronounced
contrast to the sparkling Medical
Center across the street.
Once inside the dissecting rooms,
the sunshine and a breeze filter

open just a crack. Two dozen cadavers
rest peacefully upon drainboards.
"They're far removed from life,"
says one student of physical therapy.
"They're dull, cold gray." A medical
student adds, "They're definitely
muscular, like old steak. They have no
color; they're not red and bloody."
The cadaver is flesh, not human. It
is only a number, unless the student
gives it a name. It has no past — or if it
does, the student may find his task
unbearable. For example, one physical
therapy student says his first cadaver
was a ten-year-old boy, for whom a
girl in his section had babysat. She
stopped attending labs.
Usually, one limb at a time is
unwrapped for dissection. Med
students in this quarter's anatomy
class have not yet unveiled the face of
their cadaver. "The head makes it
human again," one student says.
And the cadavers were, of course,
once human. While they lived. Dr.
Donald Gray, in charge of anatomical
gifts for 42 years until last September,
had limited contact with most of the

donors. Generally middle-aged, these
people came from all socioeconomic
backgrounds, says Gray. Almost 2000
bodies have passed through the
anatomy department since 1940 at an
average rate of 50 per year.
In recent years, each donor has
been asked to fill out a simple form
legally releasing his body after death
to the Stanford Medical Center for
research and teaching purposes.
Large Supply
For many years, the department
was supplied with the bodies of
indigents from state institutions. Since
1960, there has been a tremendous
increase in persons willing their bodies
to science.
To control the influx, the
department has restricted its
acceptance to those dying within a
30-mile radius of Stanford.
"We will pick up a body and handle
it completely (free of charge)," says
anatomical technician and embalmer
John Dolph.
Within 24 hours after death, the
bodies are embalmed, and then stored
in vats of light mineral oil in the
building's basement.
"We can store them almost
indefinitely — up to three years," says
Gray. "But we have only so much
space .. . enough to store about 50
bodies comfortably."
4000 Donors
The building can accommodate no
more than 75 per year. Presently, the
department has the names of about
4000 prospective donors on file. "We
don't have the vaguest idea how many
people who signed the forms will
eventually come in [dead]. . . . Once
the people sign, we feel a moral
commitment to take them when they
die," says Gray.
Donors cite different reasons for
making the gift. "Most everybody has
idealistic motivations," Gray
generalizes. "They want to help

science."
He will avoid the emotional and
financial burden of a funeral service.
"The whole thing [service] smacks of
sentimentality," he says bluntly.
"Funerals are an attempt to avoid
the idea of finality."
In the dissecting room, all is final.
When students have finished their
study after two quarters of class, the
remains are cremated.
Cadavers Well Treated
Before the students began
dissecting this quarter, they were
urged to treat their cadavers with due
respect. There have been no instances
of abuse, reports Gray, but other
schools do not have such clean slates.
Gray recalls a cruel prank at the
University of Washington. "One
morning we missed a whole body, and
we got a frantic call at noon from the
police that there was a body hanging
by the neck from the fire escape of the

liberal arts building." The culprits had
dressed him in a pair of sailor
dungarees.
At Stanford the department
imposes strict security to prevent
abuse.
"The disappearance of a body or a
part would be an awful thing and
terrible public relations," Gray says.
As Dolph puts it, "It's extremely
critical that people donate these
bodies. It's sort of like you can't have
a guy repairing your car unless he's
seen the inside of one before." A
medical student explains, "It would be
like studying physical diagnosis

dissecting this quarter, they were
urged to treat their cadavers with due
respect. There have been no instances
of abuse, reports Gray, but other
schools do not have such clean slates.
Gray recalls a cruel prank at the
University of Washington. "One
morning we missed a whole body, and
we got a frantic call at noon from the
police that there was a body hanging
by the neck from the fire escape of the

liberal arts building." The culprits had
dressed him in a pair of sailor
dungarees.
At Stanford the department
imposes strict security to prevent
abuse.
"The disappearance of a body or a
part would be an awful thing and
terrible public relations," Gray says.
As Dolph puts it, "It's extremely
critical that people donate these
bodies. It's sort of like you can't have
a guy repairing your car unless he's
seen the inside of one before." A
medical student explains, "It would be
like studying physical diagnosis
without a patient. It's clearly crucial."
Asked if he plans to donate his
own, the student responds in mild
confusion, "That's a question I haven't
figured out how to answer." Dolph
may know best. "These students are
more oriented toward saving life and
living, not death," he says.
"You can tell a first year med
student by his smell," admits one such
student who showers twice a day and
slathers himself with hand lotion to
keep from reeking of formaldehyde.
Visions of his human cadaver linger
along with this unmistakable, often
irritating, odor.
Most of the students who initially
were bothered by the cadavers issued
them in anatomy class this quarter feel
quite comfortable by now. Those who
donned rubber gloves and moved
gingerly during their first few weeks,
now "just dive on in," as one student
put it.
Many wear special clothes —
ranging from railroad overalls to the
conventional lab coat. They change
into them as they might a gym suit to
keep the persistent odor from
following them around campus.
Adjustment
"One student says forthrightly,
"There is an odor, but you very
quickly adjust to it. It's like working
anywhere with lots of noise or a

strange smell. You learn to associate it
with the job. That's all."
Another med student recalls, "It
bothered me the first week when I
would have to peel an orange with my
hands afterwards." Now she eats her
lunch without giving the cadaver a
thought.
"When I used to throw pots, I'd
have little bits of clay underneath my
fingernails, and now that I'm
dissecting, I have bits of bodies under
my nails. But it doesn't bother me. It
did the first week," she recalls.
Wild Imagination
"It's not as bad as you would
imagine," another student points out.
Certainly, the imagination will run
wild as the on looker peruses the
outside of the buff-colored anatomy
building with its painted-out windows.
Dating back almost 70 years, the grave
structure stands in pronounced
contrast to the sparkling Medical
Center across the street.
Once inside the dissecting rooms,
the sunshine and a breeze filter
through the translucent windows.

open just a crack. Two dozen cadavers
rest peacefully upon drainboards.
"They're far removed from life,"
says one student of physical therapy.
"They're dull, cold gray." A medical
student adds, "They're definitely
muscular, like old steak. They have no
color; they're not red and bloody."
The cadaver is flesh, not human. It
is only a number, unless the student
gives it a name. It has no past — or if it
does, the student may find his task
unbearable. For example, one physical
therapy student says his first cadaver
was a ten-year-old boy, for whom a
girl in his section had babysat. She
stopped attending labs.
Usually, one limb at a time is
unwrapped for dissection. Med
students in this quarter's anatomy
class have not yet unveiled the face of
their cadaver. "The head makes it
human again," one student says.
And the cadavers were, of course,
once human. While they lived. Dr.
Donald Gray, in charge of anatomical
gifts for 42 years until last September,
had limited contact with most of the

donors. Generally middle-aged, these
people came from all socioeconomic
backgrounds, says Gray. Almost 2000
bodies have passed through the
anatomy department since 1940 at an
average rate of 50 per year.
In recent years, each donor has
been asked to fill out a simple form
legally releasing his body after death
to the Stanford Medical Center for
research and teaching purposes.
Large Supply
For many years, the department
was supplied with the bodies of
indigents from state institutions. Since
1960, there has been a tremendous
increase in persons willing their bodies
to science.
To control the influx, the
department has restricted its
acceptance to those dying within a
30-mile radius of Stanford.
"We will pick up a body and handle
it completely (free of charge)," says
anatomical technician and embalmer
John Dolph.
Within 24 hours after death, the
bodies are embalmed, and then stored
in vats of light mineral oil in the
building's basement.
"We can store them almost
indefinitely — up to three years," says
Gray. "But we have only so much
space .. . enough to store about 50
bodies comfortably."
4000 Donors
The building can accommodate no
more than 75 per year. Presently, the
department has the names of about
4000 prospective donors on file. "We
don't have the vaguest idea how many
people who signed the forms will
eventually come in [dead]. . . . Once
the people sign, we feel a moral
commitment to take them when they
die," says Gray.
Donors cite different reasons for
making the gift. "Most everybody has
idealistic motivations," Gray
generalizes. "They want to help

science."
He will avoid the emotional and
financial burden of a funeral service.
"The whole thing [service] smacks of
sentimentality," he says bluntly.
"Funerals are an attempt to avoid
the idea of finality."
In the dissecting room, all is final.
When students have finished their
study after two quarters of class, the
remains are cremated.

commitment to take them when they
die," says Gray.
Donors cite different reasons for
making the gift. "Most everybody has
idealistic motivations," Gray
generalizes. "They want to help

science."
He will avoid the emotional and
financial burden of a funeral service.
"The whole thing [service] smacks of
sentimentality," he says bluntly.
"Funerals are an attempt to avoid
the idea of finality."
In the dissecting room, all is final.
When students have finished their
study after two quarters of class, the
remains are cremated.
Cadavers Well Treated
Before the students began
dissecting this quarter, they were
urged to treat their cadavers with due
respect. There have been no instances
of abuse, reports Gray, but other
schools do not have such clean slates.
Gray recalls a cruel prank at the
University of Washington. "One
morning we missed a whole body, and
we got a frantic call at noon from the
police that there was a body hanging
by the neck from the fire escape of the

liberal arts building." The culprits had
dressed him in a pair of sailor
dungarees.
At Stanford the department
imposes strict security to prevent
abuse.
"The disappearance of a body or a
part would be an awful thing and
terrible public relations," Gray says.
As Dolph puts it, "It's extremely
critical that people donate these
bodies. It's sort of like you can't have
a guy repairing your car unless he's
seen the inside of one before." A
medical student explains, "It would be
like studying physical diagnosis
without a patient. It's clearly crucial."
Asked if he plans to donate his
own, the student responds in mild
confusion, "That's a question I haven't
figured out how to answer." Dolph
may know best. "These students are
more oriented toward saving life and
living, not death," he says.
