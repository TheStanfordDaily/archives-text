## Sun Sets On Oregon; Beavers Scare Bruins 
### 
Just like the warm streak
brought forth by the Bay Area's
mysterious winter, Oregon's
undefeated skein in the Pacific
Eight was a terminal case —
everyone knew it had to end,
eventually.
Well, the sun remains
benevolent in Palo Alto, but over
the weekend it set in Eugene. Or
rather in Los Angeles, where the
Ducks lost to UCLA, 84-66, and
USC, 59-53.
Bill Walton fouled out Oregon
center Gerald Willett with 1:33
left in the first half, and went on
to score 25 points and add 17
rebounds. Dave Meyers' 22 points
helped keep the contest from ever
being close.
Duck coach Dick Harter had
said last week that Trojan Dan
Anderson was the best guard in
the league outside of his own Ron
Lee, and that's the way it looked
Saturday. Lee scored 16, and
Anderson led the Trojans with 13,
but SC's balance was instrumental
in a second-half streak which
masked the 22-22 halftime count.
Oregon State fared no better
against the Trojans, despite
freshman Lonnie Shelton's 21
points (John Lambert had 27 for
SC), and dropped an 81-71
decision before coming back to
startle UCLA Saturday night.
The Bruins led just 63-60 with
6:15 to go when (surprise!)
Walton and Marques Johnson
exploded. Their lead quickly
padded by five points, the Bruins
eased in for an 80-75 final. Walton
(31 points, 19 rebounds) was
again devastating.

Poor California. The Bears
drew the wrong pair of refs
Saturday night against
Washington, one of whom called
fouls on the pressing Bears but
ignored the Huskies' intimidation
under the hoop, according to
observers.
The result was that Rickie
Hawthorne's 21 points were
wasted in an 82-76 defeat. Husky
freshman James Edwards, subbing
for Lars Hansen, led Washington
with 19.
Friday the Bears survived
Norton Barnhill's 22 points to win
a nip-and-tuck battle with
Washington State, 69-65. Doug
Vilotti led Cal with 19 points.

The result was that Rickie
Hawthorne's 21 points were
wasted in an 82-76 defeat. Husky
freshman James Edwards, subbing
for Lars Hansen, led Washington
with 19.
Friday the Bears survived
Norton Barnhill's 22 points to win
a nip-and-tuck battle with
Washington State, 69-65. Doug
Vilotti led Cal with 19 points.
Just like the warm streak
brought forth by the Bay Area's
mysterious winter, Oregon's
undefeated skein in the Pacific
Eight was a terminal case —
everyone knew it had to end,
eventually.
Well, the sun remains
benevolent in Palo Alto, but over
the weekend it set in Eugene. Or
rather in Los Angeles, where the
Ducks lost to UCLA, 84-66, and
USC, 59-53.
Bill Walton fouled out Oregon
center Gerald Willett with 1:33
left in the first half, and went on
to score 25 points and add 17
rebounds. Dave Meyers' 22 points
helped keep the contest from ever
being close.
Duck coach Dick Harter had
said last week that Trojan Dan
Anderson was the best guard in
the league outside of his own Ron
Lee, and that's the way it looked
Saturday. Lee scored 16, and
Anderson led the Trojans with 13,
but SC's balance was instrumental
in a second-half streak which
masked the 22-22 halftime count.
Oregon State fared no better
against the Trojans, despite
freshman Lonnie Shelton's 21
points (John Lambert had 27 for
SC), and dropped an 81-71
decision before coming back to
startle UCLA Saturday night.
The Bruins led just 63-60 with
6:15 to go when (surprise!)
Walton and Marques Johnson
exploded. Their lead quickly
padded by five points, the Bruins
eased in for an 80-75 final. Walton
(31 points, 19 rebounds) was
again devastating.

Poor California. The Bears
drew the wrong pair of refs
Saturday night against
Washington, one of whom called
fouls on the pressing Bears but
ignored the Huskies' intimidation
under the hoop, according to
observers.
