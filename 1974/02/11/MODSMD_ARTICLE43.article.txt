11-Day Truckers' Strike To End?
There were growing indications last night that the largest
part of the strike by independent truckers is all but over.
Pennsylvania officials said National Guardsmen would stop
patroling at midnight as incidents of violence continued to
drop sharply.
Votes from small groups of strikers which were reported
yesterday were generally in favor of an end to the 11-day
strike that resulted in wholesale layoffs and spot shortages
of food and gasoline.
One sign of the developing trend was a report from
strike leader Tommy Thompson of East Point, Ga., who
said yesterday he was urging his fellow drivers to climb
back in their rigs. On Friday, Thompson said he and his
men were going to continue their strike until more of their
demands were satisfied.
Another was the decision by Pennsylvania officials to
end National Guard patrols. Pennsylvania appeared to have
suffered the worst violence during the shutdown.
Battle Rages On In Middle East
Syrian and Israeli artillery batteries blazed away at each
other on the Golan Heights again yesterday but Israel said
Russia will try to persuade Syria to meet Tel Aviv's main
conditions for negotiating a troop separation agreement
along the tense front.
These conditions are a list of Israeli POWs held by Syria
and permission for the International Red Cross to visit
them.
The Israeli announcement marked the first time that
Israel has attributed an active role to Moscow in efforts to
free the more than 100 Israeli soldiers captured in the
October war.
Waldie Fails To Win Endorsement
SACRAMENTO - California's major Democratic
volunteer organization has handed Congressman Jerome
Waldie a potentially disasterous setback in his campaign for
governor.
Although he got the most votes, Waldie failed yesterday
to win endorsement from the California Democratic
Council, a grassroots organization claiming more than
15,000 members.
Waldie had been regarded as having the inside track for
the endorsement since his generally liberal stance was more
in tune with the CDC, regarded as representing the more
liberal elements of the Democratic Party.
On a second ballot, Waldie received 47.9 percent of the
vote from the nearly 1,100 delegates attending the
three-day CDC convention here. He needed 60 percent to
gain endorsement.
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti of Van Nuys was in
second place with 29.8 percent of the vote and Secretary of
State Edmund G. Brown Jr. was third with 16.6 percent.
San Francisco businessman William Watson Roth was
fourth with 10.6 percent and Mayor Josephy Alioto of San
Francisco was fifth with nine percent of the vote on the
first ballot.
13 Oil-Consuming Nations To Meet
WASHINGTON — Leaders of 13 major oil-consuming
nations started intensive talks yesterday in preparation for

the opening today of a two-day conference on energy at the
foreign ministers' level.
Aides of the foreign ministers gathered at the State
Department to organize the agenda and procedure for the
sessions.
At the same time Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
held bilateral talks with several foreign officials, including
those from West Germany, Canada and Japan.
Kissinger will try to persuade his 12 colleagues that they
must act rationally together if they want to weather the
energy crisis and its monetary' after-effects.
The conference, proposed Jan. 10 by President Nixon, is
to be the first of a series.
Attending are the United States, Canada, Japan,
Norway, and nine countries of the European Common
Market: France, West Germany, The Netherlands, Great
Britain, Italy, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium.
Panel To Seek White House Papers
WASHINGTON — Rep. Peter W. Rodino, chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, said yesterday his
committee is about to reque cf certain documents from the
White House and already htu, sought a list of the material
compiled by the special Watergate prosecutor.
He said a meeting has been arranged for this week
between his committee's counsel and James D. St. Clair,
President Nixon's chief Watergate lawyer.
Rodino's committee is conducting an inquiry into the
possible impeachment of Nixon.
The New Jersey Democrat would not specify what
would be requested from St. Clair, but said: "We are going
to require and request the necessary documents and
whatever may be necessary."
Special Watergate Prosecutor Leon Jaworski said last
week that if the Judiciary Committee seeks material from
the prosecutor's office through a subpoena, he would fight
the move in court.
Hearst Kidnaping: Witnesses Sought
BERKELEY, Calif. — The FBI announced yesterday it is
seeking a young white couple as potential witnesses and
possible suspects in the terrorist kidnaping of newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst.
FBI Agent Thomas Druken said the man and woman
were parked in a car near Miss Hearst's apartment at the
time of her abduction last Monday night and had been
there "for a substantial period of time — well over an
hour."
No one saw them after the kidnaping, he said.
"Right now, we're only seeking them as potential
witnesses," said Druken, but he stated they could possibly
be considered suspects "if and when we find them."
The armed and revolutionary Symbionese Liberation
Army claimed last Thursday it had kidnaped Miss Hearst
and is holding her in "protective custody" as a political
prisoner. The Hearst family said it received no more word
from the kidnapers by noon yesterday.
