# Dellums Stresses Need For Political Integrity
## 
### GEORGE TIBBITS 
The Watergate scandal, says Rep.
Ronald Dellums (Dâ€”Berkeley), is "one
of the most fortuitous occurences of
modern time" because it offers "one
of the last chances to set about making
this nation what it should be."
In a speech yesterday at the
opening event of the fourth annual
Celebration of Afro-American History
Week, Dellums listed impeachment of
the President, public financing of
political campaigns and elimination of
racist and sexist stereotyping as
priorities for developing integrity in
American politics.
"Watergate," Dellums said, "means
that people in this country have taken
the value of winning and carried it to
an absurd end. We'll always have
corruption and oppression if success is
based on winning."
Instead of a political system based

solely on winning, Dellums called for a
new set of political values stressing
personal responsibility. "We have to
talk about a world that reflects values
of humanity," he said. "Not just
knee-jerk programs but fundamental
change."
In 1972, Dellums was one of seven
congressmen who called for
impeachment after President Nixon
ordered the mining of Haiphong
harbor and increased bombing of
North Vietnam. At that time it was
hard for him to win any support. But
today, he said, there are "12 or 13
thousand" letters in his office from
Berkeley residents asking for Nixon's
removal.
Dellums predicted that the House
Judiciary Committee will report out a
resolution to impeach, but he feared
that the measure will lose on the floor
"if we don't have further information
on criminal acts."
Impeachment Won't Change Country
"Impeachment," he said, "won't
change the nature of the country, but
by impeachment we can frighten the
people really in power and win some
time to really change things."
Dellums criticized the system of
funding election campaigns by private
contributions, calling it "antithetical
to the political process." He said that
"as long as politicians have big
contributors, we will have political
prostitutes. People will dance to the
tune of those who pay their finances."

He favors instead a system of public
financing of politics which he said
would cost each American only 60
cents a year.
Enemies List
Dellums also mentioned that he was
proud of the fact that he was among
the top twenty named on a White
House "enemy list."
"When I hear 'enemies,' I assume
war," he said, "and I always thought
democracy is the ability for people to
express ideas on all subjects."
Besides impeachment and political
reform, Dellums spoke out against
what he called the "niggerizing
process" in American society. "Any
process that inhibits human beings is
niggerizing," he said, adding that "if
you want, you can substitute 'victim'
for 'nigger.' "
Racism
Racism, he said, was an obvious
form of niggerizing, but he added that
sexism, war and pollution were among
its other forms. "When women are
free, men are free," he said. "As long
as society perceives you as bed mates,
bed makers, broom pushers and
typewriter punchers, you're a nigger."
Dellums called war and pollution
part of the same mentality. "A very
important part of the eco-system is
human beings," he said. "Dropping
bombs on yellow people in Asia while
saving yellow flowers in California is a
direct contradiction."
