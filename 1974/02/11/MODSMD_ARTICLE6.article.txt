# Commuters Respond To Carpool Service
## 
### CAROL KENDRICK 
Final results aren't in yet, but
Stanford's new carpool matching
service seems to be a surprise success.
So far, the carpool service has received
300 applications from as far away as

Watsonville and Mill Valley. To
accommodate even more Stanford
commuters, the application deadline
has been extended from Feb. 12 to
Feb. 15.
Frank E. Gallagher Jr., University
transportation coordinator, said that
although it's too early to tell what the
final count will be, he hadn't expected
such an enthusiastic reception for the
program from the Stanford
community.
"I'm gratified by the response, and
interested in its increased
momentum," he said.
Gallagher explained that the
application deadlinehad been extended
until Friday to reach people who may
have missed last week's publicity of
the plan to organize Stanford
commuters into carpools. This service
is being provided free by Rides for Bay
Area Commuters, a region-wide
computerized carpool program.
4000 Forms Mailed
Last Friday, 4000 application
forms were mailed to students living
off campus. The Daily and Campus
Report will publish additional
application blanks for students,
faculty, and staff both today and
Wednesday.
After the applications are filed and
recorded on punch-cards, individual
names will be run through the
California Department of
Transportation computer.
The computer is programmed to
search in expanding circles from the
census bureau population tracts until
it finds eight people living near the
applicant. Each of the nine people
selected will get a print-out with the
names and addresses of their
neighbors. Then it will be up to them
to get together.
Internal Incentives
Stanford is also providing what
Gallagher described as "internal
incentives" for people to form
carpools. Each group will be asked to
register with the Stanford police for a
carpool parking permit. This will
enable them to park in preferred areas.
Registration will also help the
transportation office find out how
many carpools are actually formed.
A weekly drawing for ten gallons of
free gasoline will provide another
incentive. The drawing will be based
on the parking permit numbers. Gary
Andrews, owner of Campus Shell, has

agreed to donate the gas.
According to Gallagher, there is no
limit to the number of carpools in the
system; the more applications they
get, the better the selection of
individuals to match into local
carpools.
He also hopes that this program will
help solve increased parking problems
at Stanford. "As carpools grow in
number, the number of cars on
campus decreases two to one," he said.
"With every 100 carpools, 200 cars are
off the road."
Gallagher added that the
coincidence of the carpool program
and the energy crisis is contributing to
the success of the plan. He said people
are aware right now of the economics
of transportation and are looking for
ways to help solve problems of fuel
consumption, pollution, and highway
crowding.
