Immoral Violations
Editor:
I was shocked and disgusted
by your recent article on streaking
and even more upset by Prof.
Cerf's flippant attitude towards
these serious acts of depravation
on the part of Stanford students.
The permissiveness exhibited by
Prof. Cerf in his letter and
Director of Police Services
Herrington in the earlier article is
indicative of the warped attitudes
which have resulted in these sick
and degenerate exhibitions.
How can a member of the
faculty accept and condone such a
flagrant attack on the high moral
purpose of Stanford University
and its student body? We must
insist that the University take
steps to protect itself from further
violations of this sort by an
immoral and perverted minority.

USE Disinterest
Editor:
Since the formation of USE,
with the help of Bruce Franklin
and some of the other has-beens
of the now defunct Vencermos,
this business of demanding one's
rights (normally gotten over by
the time you were four years old)
and striking as the ultimate death
weapon against Stanford for 'the
peoples struggle' has been voiced
constantly by them. Now your
time has come.
When you cannot get 10
percent of your membership to
come to an orientation meeting
designed to educate the masses on
strike procedure, how do you
expect the membership-at-large to
intelligently know what they are
voting for? It looks like you will
need an absentee ballot roll of
better than 90 percent. It would
be interesting to find out how
many votes were cast compared to
the total membership. This would
separate the 'Doers' from the
'Non-doers.'
Remember, a vote to strike is
a vote of confidence in the
Workers Struggle at Stanford lead
by USE as only they can lead.

T.A. Union
Editor:
Although we very much
appreciate the Daily coverage of
the T.A. union organizing
committee meeting last Tuesday,
we would like to correct some
errors in the report.
The major inaccuracy is the
statement that the University plan
allows a six percent pay raise —
the University allows no pay raise
and there has not been a raise in
T.A. pay in four years. In many
departments, the University
(Karlsmith) plan would actually
effect a 30 percent decrease in
pay-
The second error is relatively
minor; no statements were made
about length of time required to
complete a Ph.D. degree, although
we now understand that the time
varies between departments on a
range from 4 to 10 years. We do
feel that the proposed four year
maximum is unreasonable.

Positive Value Of Row Site
Editor:
May one hope that what
appears to be organized
opposition to the Row as a site
for retired and junior faculty
housing is solely a reaction to
insufficient student input into this
project. The idea of students and
emeriti living near each other
seems exciting and unusual.
As one who has lived near
students since 1941, I would
predict positive values for all
parties and relatively few
problems. Thus I hope that past
orocedural infelicities will not

blind people to the excellence of
the project itself.

Emeriti Housing
Editor:
Feb. 7 in his article
concerning the faculty housing
project, Jay Harlow quoted from
a telephone conversation which
we had about the matter. His
quotations were substantially
correct, but he left out something
which 1 consider important.
I told him that the so-called
Santa Teresa site was my first
choice. The school site was my
second choice. The subcommittee
on which I served was led to
believe by a number of staff
members that the Santa Teresa
site was not practical because of
the cost of utilities and becuase
the University had earmarked that
area for other purposes — student
housing and /or Medical School
expansion.
Again, I do not consider the
school site inappropriate, but I
would personally prefer the one
on Santa Teresa.

Bacon On Row Housing
Editor:
I find that, as one of the
"oldest living residents" of "The
Row," I am inevitably drawn into
the most recent bit of agitation
about the University's plan to
build some housing units for
Emeritus Faculty and for other
members of the Faculty and Staff.
I had an informal and
pleasant chat last week with Mr.
Jim Friend on the subject of the
site for this project in which I
expressed my agreement with the
conclusion that the proposed
location is an ideal one from
virtually all points of view. I even
had the temerity to suggest that,
contrary to a number of opinions
set forth by the political
opponents of the Old Campus
School site, the presence of a
friendly and reasonably tolerant
group of faculty residents in
actually not very close proximity
to student living groups would
enhance the "life-styles" of
everybody concerned.
I make this latter point from
a position of experience. I have
lived in my present house for
forty-five years. For thirty years
before that my cousin owned and
lived in this house. Until a few
years ago we had as close
neighbors at least eight or nine
fraternities, four women's
residences, five or six faculty
families. We were all good friends
— and still are for that matter —
although many of the fraternities
and faculty families have recently
moved to new locations.
I have no way of judging
what, if any, inhibiting effect my
family may have had on our
student neighbors. But I can say
most emphatically that our
student neighbors have been our
good friends. We like them, and
have always like them as
neighbors. I can think of no more
than half a dozen occasions in
forty-five years when we were at
all seriously inconvenienced. I
doubt if this could be said of any
neighborhood in San Francisco,
Palo Alto, or any other
community.
The fraternities that used to
be here, and the one that remains,
were and are invariably courteous,
cooperative, and, looking at the
broad picture over a long period
of time, desirable neighbors. "The
Row" has a long history of the
friendly intermingling of faculty,
staff, and student housing. To try
to make it appear otherwise, and
to predict that this carefully
planned housing development will
make it otherwise, is to do a grave
disservice to the entire
Stanford community.
