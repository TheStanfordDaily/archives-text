This program, especially designed for majors in Spanish or
allied disciplines, is accepting applications from undergraduate

majors may discuss with the Professor in residence a special
program of study. Students in the STANFORD SPANISH

residence and are expected to attend the Autumn and Winter
quarters, although special arrangements for one quarter of
residence are occasionally permitted.
For information on the calendar of field trips, courses offered
at the University of Salamanca, special fees, etc., you should get
in touch with the Department of Spanish and Portuguese or the
Office of Overseas Campuses.
Applications are now available in the Department of Spanish
and Portuguese, Building 200, Room 222. The deadline for ap
plications is February 15, 1974, but early decision on admission
may be obtained, if desired.
