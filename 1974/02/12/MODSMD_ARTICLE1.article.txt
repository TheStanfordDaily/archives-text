# Age, Taxes Enliven P.A. School Election
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
Age and taxes, two perennial
political issues, are enlivening this
year's Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) election, scheduled
for March 5.
Incumbent board member Dr.
Royce Cole, a 43-year old conservative
Republican who ran unsuccessfully in
the 1972 congressional primaries
against Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
faces five challengers this year in his
bid for reelection to the School Board.
One of the candidates is 21-year old
Joshua Goldstein, a researcher at the
Stanford Institute for Political Studies.
Paul Pease, president of an
advertising agency; Claire Smith, a
community organizer and drug
counselor.; and Alice Stratton, a
psychiatric social worker and a
housewife, are the other candidates.
Goldstein, who recently won the
endorsement of the liberal Citizen's
Caucus for the PAUSD, said he
thought a young person on the Board
could help change the teaching
philosophy from one of competition
to one of cooperation.
Social Changes
"People who want to change things
in society have to start getting elected
to local posts," he said. "We didn't
have the power to elect a President in
1972, but we do have the power to be
elected to the Palo Alto School
Board."
Goldstein's platform asserts that
the revenue loss caused by declining
enrollment in PAUSD (376 fewer
students than last year) can be
partially offset by cuts in
administration salaries and personnel
rather than the firing of teachers.
Urging the community to because
more involved in the schools, he also
wants unused classrooms turned into
centers for senior citizens and child
care.
By comparison, Cole's statement
declared that "the major responsibility
for maintaining an excellent
educational system lies with the Board
and the Administration." However, he
said he believes teacher organizations
could play a "greater role" in the
future.
Short Term Planning
Pease said he objected to the
present administration's lack of
"short-term planning." He said he
wanted to institute a series of studies
to determine enrollment and growth
needs in the coming years. Pease, an

ex-Benedictine monk, said schools
should "educate children to be secure
and to be at peace with themselves, as
well as to communicate."
Smith is the most outspoken of the
campaigners against the present
educational system. She said the only
way to change a curriculum in which
"the only thing we learn in history is
who won the wars," is to organize the
community.
She also advocated more
multi-lingual programs, more
cooperation with poorer school
districts, specifically East Palo Alto,
and a more generous use of facilities
outside the school system. She said
PAUSD could cut the expense of
laboratory equipment by cooperation
with labs at Stanford and
Hewlitt-Packard.
Establish Citizen's Board
Stratton's statement pledged that
she would try to establish a citizen's
advisory board to deal with PAUSD's
financial difficulties.
The major issue in this year's
election, however, has little to do with
what goes on in the classrooms. Palo
Alto citizens March 5 will not only
elect a School Board member, but also
decide on a controversial revenue base
increase which would keep PAUSD's
budget near its present level of $26
million.
The plan would enable the board to
collect an additional $104 per pupil by
maintaining the present property tax
rate at $5.97 per $100 of assessed
valuation. If the plan is defeated,
PAUSD could only tax $5.50 per
pupil, the rate set by State Senate Bill
90. The lower figure is based on the
district's declining enrollment.
According to Board members,
defeat of the measure might cost $2
million in revenues, force the firing of
many teachers and close a number of
experimental and vocational programs.
Even if it passes, the budget will have
to be cut by $500,000 to $800,000.
Property Taxes Limited
Senate Bill 90, passed in December,
1972. limited the money school
districts could raise through property
taxes so that the quality of education
would not be based on the wealth of
the area.
The new law responded in part to
the State Supreme Court's Serrano vs.
Priest decision in 1971. The court held
that the use of local property taxes as
the primary means of financing
schools "violates the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Senate Bill 90, however, provides a
loophole for rich districts: a "revenue
base election" by which the
community could increase the tax per
full-time student.
Smith — No Increase
Of all the Board candidates, only
Smith has declined to the increase for
this year. She denied the need for
higher taxes, suggesting that the
administration thin out its members,
concentrate less on expensive
technology and pay more attention to
education.
Goldstein, however, said he favored
compliance with the law, but he
supported the increase because he
preferred "a phase-out rather than a
cut" in less essential expenses.
Supporters of the tax hike think
the measure is in trouble. Don
Hammond, President of the School.
Board, said many people did not
understand why they should pay more
money for the schools when their own
paychecks were being squeezed by
inflation.
"We could not have chosen a more
difficult time," he said.
"But Palo Alto has never before
refused money for education.

Smith — No Increase
Of all the Board candidates, only
Smith has declined to the increase for
this year. She denied the need for
higher taxes, suggesting that the
administration thin out its members,
concentrate less on expensive
technology and pay more attention to
education.
Goldstein, however, said he favored
compliance with the law, but he
supported the increase because he
preferred "a phase-out rather than a
cut" in less essential expenses.
Supporters of the tax hike think
the measure is in trouble. Don
Hammond, President of the School.
Board, said many people did not
understand why they should pay more
money for the schools when their own
paychecks were being squeezed by
inflation.
"We could not have chosen a more
difficult time," he said.
"But Palo Alto has never before
refused money for education.
Age and taxes, two perennial
political issues, are enlivening this
year's Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) election, scheduled
for March 5.
Incumbent board member Dr.
Royce Cole, a 43-year old conservative
Republican who ran unsuccessfully in
the 1972 congressional primaries
against Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
faces five challengers this year in his
bid for reelection to the School Board.
One of the candidates is 21-year old
Joshua Goldstein, a researcher at the
Stanford Institute for Political Studies.
Paul Pease, president of an
advertising agency; Claire Smith, a
community organizer and drug
counselor.; and Alice Stratton, a
psychiatric social worker and a
housewife, are the other candidates.
Goldstein, who recently won the
endorsement of the liberal Citizen's
Caucus for the PAUSD, said he
thought a young person on the Board
could help change the teaching
philosophy from one of competition
to one of cooperation.
Social Changes
"People who want to change things
in society have to start getting elected
to local posts," he said. "We didn't
have the power to elect a President in
1972, but we do have the power to be
elected to the Palo Alto School
Board."
Goldstein's platform asserts that
the revenue loss caused by declining
enrollment in PAUSD (376 fewer
students than last year) can be
partially offset by cuts in
administration salaries and personnel
rather than the firing of teachers.
Urging the community to because
more involved in the schools, he also
wants unused classrooms turned into
centers for senior citizens and child
care.
By comparison, Cole's statement
declared that "the major responsibility
for maintaining an excellent
educational system lies with the Board
and the Administration." However, he
said he believes teacher organizations
could play a "greater role" in the
future.
Short Term Planning
Pease said he objected to the
present administration's lack of
"short-term planning." He said he
wanted to institute a series of studies
to determine enrollment and growth
needs in the coming years. Pease, an

ex-Benedictine monk, said schools
should "educate children to be secure
and to be at peace with themselves, as
well as to communicate."
Smith is the most outspoken of the
campaigners against the present
educational system. She said the only
way to change a curriculum in which
"the only thing we learn in history is
who won the wars," is to organize the
community.
She also advocated more
multi-lingual programs, more
cooperation with poorer school
districts, specifically East Palo Alto,
and a more generous use of facilities
outside the school system. She said
PAUSD could cut the expense of
laboratory equipment by cooperation
with labs at Stanford and
Hewlitt-Packard.
Establish Citizen's Board
Stratton's statement pledged that
she would try to establish a citizen's
advisory board to deal with PAUSD's
financial difficulties.
The major issue in this year's
election, however, has little to do with
what goes on in the classrooms. Palo
Alto citizens March 5 will not only
elect a School Board member, but also
decide on a controversial revenue base
increase which would keep PAUSD's
budget near its present level of $26
million.
The plan would enable the board to
collect an additional $104 per pupil by
maintaining the present property tax
rate at $5.97 per $100 of assessed
valuation. If the plan is defeated,
PAUSD could only tax $5.50 per
pupil, the rate set by State Senate Bill
90. The lower figure is based on the
district's declining enrollment.
According to Board members,
defeat of the measure might cost $2
million in revenues, force the firing of
many teachers and close a number of
experimental and vocational programs.
Even if it passes, the budget will have
to be cut by $500,000 to $800,000.
Property Taxes Limited
Senate Bill 90, passed in December,
1972. limited the money school
districts could raise through property
taxes so that the quality of education
would not be based on the wealth of
the area.
The new law responded in part to
the State Supreme Court's Serrano vs.
Priest decision in 1971. The court held
that the use of local property taxes as
the primary means of financing
schools "violates the equal protection

90. The lower figure is based on the
district's declining enrollment.
According to Board members,
defeat of the measure might cost $2
million in revenues, force the firing of
many teachers and close a number of
experimental and vocational programs.
Even if it passes, the budget will have
to be cut by $500,000 to $800,000.
Property Taxes Limited
Senate Bill 90, passed in December,
1972. limited the money school
districts could raise through property
taxes so that the quality of education
would not be based on the wealth of
the area.
The new law responded in part to
the State Supreme Court's Serrano vs.
Priest decision in 1971. The court held
that the use of local property taxes as
the primary means of financing
schools "violates the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Senate Bill 90, however, provides a
loophole for rich districts: a "revenue
base election" by which the
community could increase the tax per
full-time student.
Smith — No Increase
Of all the Board candidates, only
Smith has declined to the increase for
this year. She denied the need for
higher taxes, suggesting that the
administration thin out its members,
concentrate less on expensive
technology and pay more attention to
education.
Goldstein, however, said he favored
compliance with the law, but he
supported the increase because he
preferred "a phase-out rather than a
cut" in less essential expenses.
Supporters of the tax hike think
the measure is in trouble. Don
Hammond, President of the School.
Board, said many people did not
understand why they should pay more
money for the schools when their own
paychecks were being squeezed by
inflation.
"We could not have chosen a more
difficult time," he said.
"But Palo Alto has never before
refused money for education.
Age and taxes, two perennial
political issues, are enlivening this
year's Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) election, scheduled
for March 5.
Incumbent board member Dr.
Royce Cole, a 43-year old conservative
Republican who ran unsuccessfully in
the 1972 congressional primaries
against Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
faces five challengers this year in his
bid for reelection to the School Board.
One of the candidates is 21-year old
Joshua Goldstein, a researcher at the
Stanford Institute for Political Studies.
Paul Pease, president of an
advertising agency; Claire Smith, a
community organizer and drug
counselor.; and Alice Stratton, a
psychiatric social worker and a
housewife, are the other candidates.
Goldstein, who recently won the
endorsement of the liberal Citizen's
Caucus for the PAUSD, said he
thought a young person on the Board
could help change the teaching
philosophy from one of competition
to one of cooperation.
Social Changes
"People who want to change things
in society have to start getting elected
to local posts," he said. "We didn't
have the power to elect a President in
1972, but we do have the power to be
elected to the Palo Alto School
Board."
Goldstein's platform asserts that
the revenue loss caused by declining
enrollment in PAUSD (376 fewer
students than last year) can be
partially offset by cuts in
administration salaries and personnel
rather than the firing of teachers.
Urging the community to because
more involved in the schools, he also
wants unused classrooms turned into
centers for senior citizens and child
care.
By comparison, Cole's statement
declared that "the major responsibility
for maintaining an excellent
educational system lies with the Board
and the Administration." However, he
said he believes teacher organizations
could play a "greater role" in the
future.
Short Term Planning
Pease said he objected to the
present administration's lack of
"short-term planning." He said he
wanted to institute a series of studies
to determine enrollment and growth
needs in the coming years. Pease, an

ex-Benedictine monk, said schools
should "educate children to be secure
and to be at peace with themselves, as
well as to communicate."
Smith is the most outspoken of the
campaigners against the present
educational system. She said the only
way to change a curriculum in which
"the only thing we learn in history is
who won the wars," is to organize the
community.
She also advocated more
multi-lingual programs, more
cooperation with poorer school
districts, specifically East Palo Alto,
and a more generous use of facilities
outside the school system. She said
PAUSD could cut the expense of
laboratory equipment by cooperation
with labs at Stanford and
Hewlitt-Packard.
Establish Citizen's Board
Stratton's statement pledged that
she would try to establish a citizen's
advisory board to deal with PAUSD's
financial difficulties.
The major issue in this year's
election, however, has little to do with
what goes on in the classrooms. Palo
Alto citizens March 5 will not only
elect a School Board member, but also
decide on a controversial revenue base
increase which would keep PAUSD's
budget near its present level of $26
million.
The plan would enable the board to
collect an additional $104 per pupil by
maintaining the present property tax
rate at $5.97 per $100 of assessed
valuation. If the plan is defeated,
PAUSD could only tax $5.50 per
pupil, the rate set by State Senate Bill
90. The lower figure is based on the
district's declining enrollment.
