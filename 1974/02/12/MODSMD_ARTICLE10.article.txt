Stanford workers are no longer
isolated. We are no longer alone.
Saturday, Feb. 2, United
Stanford Employees held a
meeting to discuss what we could
do if the University
administration continues to
contemptuously ignore us by
failing to seriously consider our
wants and needs and by failing to
bargain with us in good faith.
Organizers and officials from
other local unions whose members
work in hospitals, universities and
government, outlined to us in
detail some of their experiences in
meeting and overcoming
hard-nosed, arrogant employers.
Vice President Twomey from the
national office of the Service
Employees Internation Union, our
parent organization, stated that
the best strike is one we can
prevent without sacrificing our
basic demands. We learned,
however, that we must be
organizationally prepared to act in
self defense if the University
forces us against the wall.
We were assured of every
support from our parent
international union, SEIU, from
hundreds of local labor unions
affiliated with the Santa Clara and
San Mateo Central Labor Councils
of the AFL-CIO, as well as from
other labor unions in the bay area.
Hopefully this demonstration of
help and support will make the
University administration realize
that Stanford workers are no
longer isolated from the
community and that with our
united, combined strength, we can
achieve our wants.
What do we want; We want
wages equivalent to those in the
community outside Stanford. We
want enough to keep up with the
ever increasing cost of food, fuel
and shelter. We want equity for
the black, brown and women
workers. We want a minimum
pension of $150 a month for
retiring workers. We want medical
and dental coverage paid for by
the University for workers and
their dependents. We want job
security. We are mature,
independent adults who want a
voice in our workday world.
Is this too much to ask for? I
appeal to all workers, especially to
those Stanford workers outside
the bargaining unit: are not these
needs your needs too? Please
support us, work with us, join us.
We are citizens as well as
workers of the Stanford
community. This is our university
too. Together with the other
constituents of the campus, the
students and faculty, we will win
and make this University a better
place in which to work, to study
and to live.
Let's face it: the most
important aspect of the meeting
was the added strength in our
bargaining power.
