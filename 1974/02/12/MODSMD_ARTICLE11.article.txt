# Doctor Shortage: Problems And Solutions
##

Our country's shortage of
physicians, coupled with the
pitifully small number of
applicants admitted to our
medical schools, threatens all of
us with a future of increasingly
poor health care.
But Bruce Smyth's suggestion
of a "free market" type of
medical education (Daily, Feb. 7)
lacks sense.
Like many moronic ideas, this
one rests on a solid base of
misinformation. For instance,
Smyth says the doctor shortage is
rarely examined or discussed.
While it may be true that the
Stanford undergarduate of the
'70s is more into grade-grubbing
than discussing social issues, we
do not lack educated commentary
on this subject.
Someone like Smyth wishing
to inform himself about the
situation could read William G.
Anlyan et al. The Future of
Medical Education (Duke, 1973),
the Carenegie Commission's
Higher Education and the
Nation's Health (McGraw-Hill,
1970), the Report of the National
Advisory Commission on Health
Manpower) (U.S. Govt. Printing
Office, 1967), or pick up
practically any issue of the Jourla
of Medical Education.
Smyth Ignores History
When Smyth maintains that
the number of rejections to
medical school is due to a
shortage of medical schools, he
ignores history. During World War
11, existing medical schools turned
out greatly increased numbers of
doctors. Furthermore, many
eminent students of the current
situation, including the Carnegie
Commission panel, feel the
number of students in existing

schools could be greatly increased
if the medical schools were not on
the verge of going broke quite so
often.
Money, not the A.M.A.'s
accreditation of medical schools,
is the root of this evil. Our society
is finally becoming committed to
the principle that it is a human
right to have access to first-class
medical care. While the rich may
have Cadillacs and the poor VWs,
the poor must not get quacks
while the rich get well.
Medical knowledge has made
quantum leaps since the 1910
Flexner report. Like every
industry that has become complex
in that time, the medical
knowledge industry must expend
vast sums to build a new school.
Schools A Package
Medical schools are a package,
incorporating research, teaching,
and medical services. To become a
competent physician, a student
must participate in all of these
activities. Given these realities,
where are these "free Market"
medical schools going to come
from?
If they attempt to provide the
same level of training now offered
by existing schools, they will have
to spend similar amounts of
money. If that money were
forthcoming, our existing schools
would expand. If new schools cut
corners beyond the kind of
modifications of design, content,
and duration now being
considered by existing schools,
the result would be two classes of
medical care, one from the "free
market" schools, one from the
established ones.
From this analysis of Smyth's
scheme, don't infer any blanket
defense of the institution of

American medicine. Much of the
sitution that now exists has been
brought on by the profession and
the schools themselves. By
competing for status, for example,
the schools have often spent
inappropriate sums trying to be
best in glamorous fields, causing
wasteful duplication of resources
in some areas with corresponding
gaps throughout the system in
others.
Other Proposals
But concerned scholars and
practitioners are now coming up
with reasoned proposals which
deserve the attention Smyth's
proposal does not. Reference to
the resources mentioned above
will give the interested reader a
good start toward understanding.
One idea of special interest to
pre-medical students is that of
"open admissions." William D.
Bradford of the Duke University
Medical Center writes, .. open
admission means no upper limit
on numbers for qualified
candidates ... fit] is more
democratic and . . . would bring
to medicine a better
representation of ethnic and racial
groups than now exists . . . open
admissions would give each
student who desired to study
medicine the opportunity to . ..
'show what he can do' and would
avoid the tragic disappointment
of the thousands of our young
who are denied admission each
year."
Bradford recommends a
national study of "open
admissions" by a body such as the
Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Sciences or
the National Science Foundation.
It is a proposal any pre-med might
take considerable career interest

in examining and supporting.
The decisions made during this
decade about health care — be
they about national health
insurance, manpower, continuing
education, or methods of health
care delivery — are crucial to our

future. They deserve to be looked
at in much more detail than is
necessary to propose a worn and
inappropriate notion of a "free
market."
