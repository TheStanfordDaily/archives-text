# Kidney Dialysis Unit
## Machines Provide Lifeline 
### GLADYS GUNDRUM 
We all may feel dependent on
machines, but for people like
38-year-old Dee Eads, a Stanford
Medical Center patient, machines
can be life-savers.
Eads had been "just going
along great" when almost three
years ago she found out she had
kidney disease. Like many people,
she had given little thought to her
kidneys. She soon found out that
the body cannot survive long
without the continuous filtering
of poisons and waste products
from the bloodstream.
Eads remembers the dread she
felt when she learned of the
implications. "It was terrible. My
husband and I just shook," she
says.
The options for chronic kidney
disease patients are life-long
dialysis — a process whereby a
machine assumes the vital filtering
function — or a kidney transplant.
Search For Surgeon
Until last summer, the
Stanford Hemodialysis Unit
offered both choices. The
transplant program was suspended
because no surgeon was available.
According to Dr. Phillip Pennell,
director of the Hemodialysis Unit,
the hospital "is actively seeking a
full-time transplant surgeon. We
hope to have one by next year."
For many patients transplants
are not feasible because of their
medical conditions, unavailability
of a suitable donor or even
unwillingness of the patient to
undergo the unknown.
'The risks can be too high,"
says Lois Christopherson, chief
social worker, Department of
Surgery. "There can be much
anxiety if the donor is a family
member. Also, transplants are not
always successful. Dialysis must
then become a way of life."
Last year when her kidneys
failed completely, Eads came to
the Hemodialysis Unit where two
small tubes were implanted in her
arm. She was then linked to an
artificial kidney machine which
drew the blood from her vein,
cleansed it, and returned it to her
bloodstream.

For her, the process now takes
eight hours every three days. With
setting up and cleaning the
machine, the entire procedure can
take 11 hours.
The time Eads devotes to
dialysis is typical. Because she has
been trained in home dialysis,
however, she is more independent
than many.
Home Training
To be eligible for home
training, a patient must have a
helper in the home who can assist
in the dialysis and in case of
emergency. Nurses and
technicians conduct a six to eight
week home training program three
times a week. According to Candy
Streitz, head nurse of the
Hemodialysis Unit, patients learn
how their bodies react to the
machine, how to handle
emergencies, and how the
machine works.
"The focus of our program is
self care," says Dr. Pennell. "By
next summer we hope to have a
new, more compact unit. We will
then have an extra training bed so
we can train 24 instead of 12
patients a year."
In addition to one training bed,
the unit now has five beds for
chronic dialysis patients who need
weekly treatments and one bed
for acutely ill patients. At present,
34 patients are on dialysis and
two are in a home training
program.
"Patients need to learn that the
dialysis machine is their friend
and not their enemy," Streitz
says.
This can be a difficult
adjustment. The machine is
expensive, time-consuming, and
psychologically debilitating. "In
the beginning," Eads says,"the
machine was hard to accept. I was
scared and very depressed. There
is of course the physical
adjustment, but the biggest
change is in your life style.
Suddenly your parade is rained
on."
Social worker Christopherson
says that the patient's comfort
with the machine can be
important. "For some patients,

once they know the mechanics of
it, they can say, 'that's really
simple,' and appreciate the
machine. Others who are
intimidated by machines may
constantly be afraid it will break
down."
Patient Guilt
The patient's guilt can be even
more serious. The time-consuming
nature of dialysis and the need for
a helper at home are bound to put
a strain on family members, says
Christopherson. "Even if they are
stable, sick persons will wish they
weren't sick. Suddenly it becomes
impossible to plan for the future
or take trips to places that do not
have dialysis centers."
Even if patients can learn to
make satisfactory physical and
psychological adjustments, they
cannot escape the financial
burden of dialysis. The yearly bill
for hospital dialysis can exceed
$30,000. A single dialysis run at
most centers is approximately
$200.
"Prior to last July," says
Christopherson, "the situation
was horrendous." At that time an
amendment to the Social Security
Act was passed which eases the
burden on some families.
If a patient is eligible for social
security benefits, 70 to 80 percent
of the costs will be covered.
Sometimes the remainder can be
paid through the patient's own
medical insurance or savings.
"This still leaves some patients
financially vulnerable," notes
Christopherson.
Part of the reason for delay in
adequate financial legislation may
be the newness of long-term
dialysis care. While successful
kidney transplants were done in
the early 19505, dialysis as it
exists today did not occur until
1960.
The breakthrough was
development of a shunt, or tubes,
which could be placed
permanently in the patient's arm
or leg to provide ready access to
the bloodstream. Recently, a
fistula, or internal artery-vein
connection, has become an
alternative.

One of the newest
developments is a wearable
artificial kidney. It weighs only
five pounds and is about the size
of a large cigar box. Still in the
experimental stage, it would
reduce the need to use a
conventional machine to once a
week. It is not expected to be
generally available, however, for
at least three years.
Meanwhile, the number of
dialysis centers continues to
increase. At present, California
has nearly 80, to serve its more
than 2000 patients who require
the treatment.
Since September, Stanford has
been unable to accept new dialysis
patients. "This is a temporary
problem," says Dr. Pennell. Next
month the first of four satellite
units will open in San Jose, he
explained, "where we will be able
to refer some of our patients."
Regardless of the programs a
hospital can offer, the dialysis
patient continues to face an
uncertain future. "It's hard to
convince people that I have a
sense of urgency about things I
want to do," Eads says. "Lots of
people think they'll live forever. I
know I won't, so I want to enjoy
my family and do the things that
are meaningful to me. I don't
want to waste my time on
unimportant things."
