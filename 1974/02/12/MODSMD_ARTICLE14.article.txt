# Study Shows What You Eat Affects Behavioral Patterns
## 
### Associated Press 
NEW YORK — What you eat
apparently can affect the
chemistry of your brain. And any
change could perhaps affect
appetite, sleep, sexual activity and
other behavior, two scientists
report.
A steak dinner or a spaghetti
dinner thus might have quite
different effects, their findings
suggest.
In animal studies, the scientists
find, different types of foodstuffs
can alter the amount of a
powerful chemical, serotonin,
involved in the activity of brain
nerve cells.
Carbohydrates — meaning
sugars and starchy foods like
spaghetti — increase the available
serotonin.
Reduction
But lots of protein foods, like a
steak or milk, can reduce it, say
John B. Fernstrom, Ph.D., and
Richard J. Wurtman, M.D., of
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass.
Exactly what the effects may
be in humans has not been
demonstrated. But animal studies
by other researchers have shown:
— Cats deprived of brain
serotonin become insomniacs.
And male and female rats with the
reduced brain serotonin levels
show exaggerated sexual activity.
— But high levels of brain
serotonin make rats more sensitive
to pain, more likely to sleep, and
also reduce their appetite.
Other Evidence
There is other evidence that in
humans serotonin is involved in
the brain's state of alertness, a
person's mood or motiviation, and
willingness or interest in doing
some task, Wurtman said in a
telephone interview.
He is director of MlT's
laboratory of Neuroendocrine
Regulation.
Fernstrom is assistant professor

of nutritional biochemistry and
metabolism.
They report their studies in the
February issue of the publication
Scientific American.
Heretofore, they said, it had
been thought that the brain was
not affected by diet except
through chronic malnutrition.
Their evidence is that what a
person eats may affect brain
activity within 20 to 30 minutes.
N eur otransm itter
They have been investigating
serotonin, which is a
neurotransmitter, a substance
produced in a special set of
neurons or brain cells. Released
into spaces — or synapses —
between neurons, serotonin
affects and is partly responsible
for the flow of information for
messages between neurons.
The new findings suggest that
food intake can affect the way
neurons "sense" bodily states, and
help the brain "decide" whether
to be hungry or sleepy, for
example.
A key element in the
manufacture of serotonin is
tryptophan, which is one of some
20 amino acids or building blocks
of protein.
A steak contains some
tryptophan, but not as much of it
as some other amino acids that
compete for entry into the brain,
Wurtman and Fernstrom
explained.
The other amino acids tend to
win out, and not much
tryptophan gets into the brain
cells.
Spaghetti Reaction
But carbohydrates, like that in
spaghetti, spur the secretion of

the hormone insulin, which in
turn increases the level of
tryptophan in the blood and
lowers the blood level of the
competing amino acids. The result
is an increase in the amount of
serotonin in the brain.
The scientists could study the
level of serotonin itself in animal
brains, but not in the brains of
human volunteers following a
meal. So to gauge how their
findings in animals might apply to
humans, they turned to measuring
the levels of various amino acids
in the bloodstreams of humans
and animals.
These blood studies, based on
the supposition that the levels of
amino acids had a resulting effect
on actual serotonin manufacture
in the brain, showed a parallel.
Humans drinking a quart of
milk protein or a quart of
gingerale carbohydrate showed
similar changes in their blood as
did rats after high protein or high
carbohydrate meals, Wurtman
said.
It seems, the scientists write,
that food consumption may affect
brain chemistry, and brain
chemistry, in turn, may affect
food consumption. It is likely,
they add, that other
neurotransmitters in the brain
may be affected by what we eat
and thus to some extent how we
behave.

brains, but not in the brains of
human volunteers following a
meal. So to gauge how their
findings in animals might apply to
humans, they turned to measuring
the levels of various amino acids
in the bloodstreams of humans
and animals.
These blood studies, based on
the supposition that the levels of
amino acids had a resulting effect
on actual serotonin manufacture
in the brain, showed a parallel.
Humans drinking a quart of
milk protein or a quart of
gingerale carbohydrate showed
similar changes in their blood as
did rats after high protein or high
carbohydrate meals, Wurtman
said.
It seems, the scientists write,
that food consumption may affect
brain chemistry, and brain
chemistry, in turn, may affect
food consumption. It is likely,
they add, that other
neurotransmitters in the brain
may be affected by what we eat
and thus to some extent how we
behave.
NEW YORK — What you eat
apparently can affect the
chemistry of your brain. And any
change could perhaps affect
appetite, sleep, sexual activity and
other behavior, two scientists
report.
A steak dinner or a spaghetti
dinner thus might have quite
different effects, their findings
suggest.
In animal studies, the scientists
find, different types of foodstuffs
can alter the amount of a
powerful chemical, serotonin,
involved in the activity of brain
nerve cells.
Carbohydrates — meaning
sugars and starchy foods like
spaghetti — increase the available
serotonin.
Reduction
But lots of protein foods, like a
steak or milk, can reduce it, say
John B. Fernstrom, Ph.D., and
Richard J. Wurtman, M.D., of
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass.
Exactly what the effects may
be in humans has not been
demonstrated. But animal studies
by other researchers have shown:
— Cats deprived of brain
serotonin become insomniacs.
And male and female rats with the
reduced brain serotonin levels
show exaggerated sexual activity.
— But high levels of brain
serotonin make rats more sensitive
to pain, more likely to sleep, and
also reduce their appetite.
Other Evidence
There is other evidence that in
humans serotonin is involved in
the brain's state of alertness, a
person's mood or motiviation, and
willingness or interest in doing
some task, Wurtman said in a
telephone interview.
He is director of MlT's
laboratory of Neuroendocrine
Regulation.
Fernstrom is assistant professor

of nutritional biochemistry and
metabolism.
They report their studies in the
February issue of the publication
Scientific American.
Heretofore, they said, it had
been thought that the brain was
not affected by diet except
through chronic malnutrition.
Their evidence is that what a
person eats may affect brain
activity within 20 to 30 minutes.
N eur otransm itter
They have been investigating
serotonin, which is a
neurotransmitter, a substance
produced in a special set of
neurons or brain cells. Released
into spaces — or synapses —
between neurons, serotonin
affects and is partly responsible
for the flow of information for
messages between neurons.
The new findings suggest that
food intake can affect the way
neurons "sense" bodily states, and
help the brain "decide" whether
to be hungry or sleepy, for
example.
A key element in the
manufacture of serotonin is
tryptophan, which is one of some
20 amino acids or building blocks
of protein.
A steak contains some
tryptophan, but not as much of it
as some other amino acids that
compete for entry into the brain,
Wurtman and Fernstrom
explained.
The other amino acids tend to
win out, and not much
tryptophan gets into the brain
cells.
Spaghetti Reaction
But carbohydrates, like that in
spaghetti, spur the secretion of

the hormone insulin, which in
turn increases the level of
tryptophan in the blood and
lowers the blood level of the
competing amino acids. The result
is an increase in the amount of
serotonin in the brain.
