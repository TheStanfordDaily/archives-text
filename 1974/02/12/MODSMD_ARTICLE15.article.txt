Two additional psychiatrists have joined the staff of Cowell Health
Center, Dr. David Dorosin, chief psychiatrist, has announced.
The two are Drs. David M. Daniels and Allan Seid. Both will serve
part-time. In addition, Seid will serve as psychiatric consultant to the
campus' Asian-American community.
Daniels is a graduate of Stanford Medical School. He took his
psychiatric training there, at the Veterans Administration Hospital on
the campus, and at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
He was a member of the Medical School's teaching faculty for eight
years before going into private practice in 1970. He is a clinical
associate professor of psychiatry at the Medical School.
Daniels' research includes studies of violence and aggression,
mental hospitals, and rehabilitation of the mentally ill. He is the
author of Violence in the Struggle for Existence, and has been a
visiting professor at the Universities of Rochester and Illinois.
Seid, a recent candidate for Palo Alto City Council, is a graduate of
the University of Southern California who also took his psychiatric
training at Stanford. He holds a master's degree in sociology from
Stanford.
Busy in many community affairs, Seid has been chairman of the
Santa Clara County Drug Abuse Coordination Commission, the Palo
Alto Citizens Task Force on Drug Abuse, and of its county
counterpart, and a member of the county's Human Relations
Commission, and the county's regional Criminal Justice Planning
Board.
In 1971 Seid was doubly honored as "volunteer of the year" by
the county and the state Mental Health Association. His services have
been formally acknowledged in awards from the Palo Alto City
Council and the California PTA Congress.
