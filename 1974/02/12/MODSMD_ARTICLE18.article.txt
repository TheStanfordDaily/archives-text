## 
### 
The Rodin sculpture
displayed in the surrounding
photographs is a selection from
the collection recently donated
to Stanford. At top left is the
piece "Reclining Figure from
'The Gates of Hell' " (Approx.
1880-82). At top right,
donator Gerald B. Cantor is
shown discussing further
arrangements for transport of
the sculpture "The Walking
Man" with Albert Elsen,
Professor of Art History. To
the left, Elsen and Cantor
stand amidst scultpures from
Mr. Cantor's private collection.
A total of 88 pieces will be
given to the Stanford Museum
which will soon enclose the
greatest number of Rodin
works outside of Paris. They
will be housed in the south
rotunda of the Museum â€” to
be named the G.B. Cantor
Gallery.
