# Bejart Excites

CUPERTINO — Maurice Bejart thinks dance is not a trade, nor an
art, but an essential human activity. It is a way of being, as important
as breathing, eating, loving, speaking. Friday night's audience at Flint
Center at De Anza College might have begun to think so too, as they
rose in a standing ovation for the world-famous international
company.
What is perhaps most exciting about the Ballet of the Twentieth
Century is the sheer number and artistry of the male dancers. Like so
many European choreographers, Bejart understands the male body
and its fantastic dance potential and refuses to relegate his men to the
role of cavalier. Moreover, he teaches his male dancers to be expansive
and uninhibited in the use of their torso, head, and arms — a rarity,
indeed, in the ballet world. The result is dramatic, even overwhelming.
Chant du Compagnon Errant, created to the "Lieder eines
fahrenden Gesselen" by Gustav Mahler, explores a full range of
emotion and movement that is uniquely male. Based on Mahler's
confessions, his autobiography in a sense, it is the story of an
artist-wanderer pursued by his destiny and caught in a conflict with
himself and his need for solitude.
Jorge Donn as the questioning youth is amazingly loose and
flowing; neither a caricature nor overbearing, he nonetheless allows
himself free and complete expression of his face, hands, and back.
Daniel Lommel provides the necessary contrast to Donn's wavering
fluidity with complete assurance, strength, and compelling dramatic
power.
Versatility, Freshness
The training that Bejart's dancers receive in a wide range of styles,
from classical and modern to Eastern dancing and mime, brings them
an intelligent versatility and freshness not often found in ballet today.
Most American ballet companies now devote much of their repertoire
to modern and jazz pieces, but the result is too often a group of ballet
dancers trying desperately but vainly to be something else. Unaware
of the essentials of the different styles, they too often just go through
the motions and thus the performance is little more than an empty
shell.
Bejart's Bhatki is a happy exception; the dancers have the
advantages of the ballet background without being tied to it.
The pas de deux of Lommel and Angele Albrecht effectively
combines classical, modern, and Indian moves to the accompaniment
of Indian folk music. At once sensuous and geometric, it fully exploits
the use of point in Albrecht's solo, extending her range of speed and
agility. Hips, eyes, head, and arms act disconnectedly, with a
magnetic, animal-like quality.
Tedium As Device
An element of tedium is certainly evident in Bejart's works. Pieces
drag and lulls go on much longer than is apparently desirable. Yet the
tedium is not empty, but rather a device to slowly build and
interconnect passages and ideas.
Certain parts of the Iranian Suite go on and on, nearly ad nauscum,
but suddenly and unexpectedly Bejart brings forth new vitality and
power, as in the phenomenal Dansc Des Garcons. The quiet control
and restraint of Dyane Gray-Cullert as a solitary figure in black ties
the piece together; Jorge Donn in a tremendously demanding solo
carries us with conviction to the very end, long awaited but strangely
more satisfying than if Bejart had cut us off earlier.
The Evolving Bejart
On the whole, Bejart's choreography is innovative without being
contrived, and with enough substance and continuity so as to satisfy
the audience. Several segments, particularly in the program's opener,
were spatially disjointed, but Bejart does not often leave us hanging.
He is without question one of the greatest talents in dance today. He
believes that ballet should not be the prerogative of a few, and shuns
tradition in favor of research, attempting to find a new sense of
validity in the dance experience. "One evolves because one changes,"
he writes. "I am no longer physically the man I was twenty years ago
and I am no longer morally the man I was twenty years ago. Me, is
nclw and in a few years I will again be different."
