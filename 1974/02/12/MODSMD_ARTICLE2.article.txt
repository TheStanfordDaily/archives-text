# Kurtz Brightens White Plaza Scene
## Artisan Blows Minds With Glass 
### HELEN CORRIGAN 
Les Kurtz, the glass blower at White
Plaza, recently added a "male
chauvinist" pig to his wares. But so
far, a pregnant pig remains most in
demand.
Ho also sells seagulls, ships, octopi,
pear trees, elephants, unicorns and
peacocks. Because dragons, for some
reason, have suddenly become
popular, Kurtz displays one sculpture
of a feeble man attempting to fight a
monster. Underneath are the words
"Know thyself."
Les Kurtz has been blowing glass
since he tired of his job with the post
office 15 years ago. He works from 8
a.m. to 11 p.m., often seven days a
week — and says he enjoys it. He is
independent. He says he never gets
bored. And he likes the feedback he
gets after he sells an item.
"People relate to glass," he says.
"It's clean, expressive, graceful. It's a
beautiful medium."
"There is no limit to what you can
do in glass," says Kurtz. "You can let
your imagination go wild." He usually
adds three to five new items to his
stock each week. He expects to have
some "passion meters" ready just in
time for Valentine's Day.
Custom Work
Kurtz also does custom work. He
averages five special requests a day, he
says."I will take on almost any
challenge that I can tackle."
He points to his first attempts at a
moose and a grizzly bear, and he
mentions that he has recently
completed a model of the Star-Trek
spaceship, "Enterprise."
The only orders Kurtz can
remember refusing were for an army
tank and pipes. He never does pipes.
Kurtz maintains a large catalogue of
animal pictures to enable customers to
give him an idea of what they want.
He decided the practice was essential
after a woman requested a glass
Boston terrier and then showed him a
picture of a bulldog.
Few Craftsman
Kurtz estimates there are 10,000
glass blowers in the U.S., but most of
them do technical work. There are
onlv about 100 nationwide who are

dedicated to glass blowing as a craft,
he says.
Kurtz used to travel the "art show
circuit" from Washington to Los
Angeles. He got wind of the vendors
here only a few months ago, and he
has been selling his wares on campus
since Nov. 30.
He learned his trade from a count
who would be horrified to see him
selling rather than exhibiting his
pieces. "Art's all right in its own
place," says Kurtz, "but you have to
live."
Secretive Trade
It is a very secretive trade. In the
Middle Ages, glass shop owners often
cut out the tongues of workers who
left their shops. This surgical barbarity
ensured that house secrets remained

secrets. Today, glass blowers no longer
fear for their tongues, but most are
reluctant to share trade secrets.
Les Kurtz is different. In his
10-lesson course he teaches people "to
think in glass." (The next classes will
begin in late March.) He is even
considering a correspondence course in
glass blowing.
Kurtz does not worry that people
will steal his ideas. "If they do, they
are imprisoned by my thought," he
jests.
Patience Needed
What does it take to become a glass
blower? "Patience to get in there and
try and keep trying," says Kurtz. The
equipment is relatively cheap; he
estimates that it costs about $125 for

PLAZA ARTIST — Les Kurtz may often be seen at White Plaza, working at a job
which he greatly enjoys — blowing glass and selling his works. Kurtz, unlike
many glass blowers, is willing to share trade secrets.
