# Vonk Makes Debut
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
SAN FRANCISCO - Youthful
Dutch conductor Hans Vonk
made his American debut with the
San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra last Wednesday evening
in a masterful concert unevenly
received by a medium-size War
Memorial Opera House audience.
Maestro Vonk, former
Assistant Conductor with the
Concert-gebouw Orchestra of
Amsterdam, proved himself a
no-nonsense musician whose
rhythmic poise and refined taste
brought his interpretation of
Bizet's Symphony in C Major to
sparkling life, and served him in
even better stead in Otto Ketting's
Time Machine and Stravinski's
famous Petrouchka.
Bizet's Symphony opened both
the program and the eyes of many
audience members capable of
appreciating Maestro Vonk's
thorough and subtle handling of
the score.
Otto Ketting's delightful Time
Machine for winds and percussion
showed off Vonk's rhythmic
control and personal pressence
brilliantly. Mildly avant-garde,
Ketting's piece calls to mind
Webern's Pointillist orchestration

as well as Stravinskian rhythmic
figures and acrid, yet tonal,
harmonies.
Many of us complain (and
frequently, I believe, with good
reason) about the absence of
musicality in much modern
"serious" music. Time Machine,
straightforward and colorful,
favorably impressed much of the
audience; a few boos from the
front of the hall also proved that
standards of teste are, thankfully,
still with us.
The 1947 revised version of
Petrouchka, one of Stravinski's
early masterpieces, brought the
evening to a breathtaking
conclusion. Petrouchka requires a
massive orchestra, including harp,
multiple winds and brasses, and a
prominent solo piano. A blend of
Impressionistic detail and
foot-stomping vitality gives this
stallion an almost unique place in
the stable of modern concert-hall
war horses.
Yet not even the kindest music
lover could have entirely
overlooked a number of seriously
flawed brass solos. Forgiving these
artistic indiscretions, the audience
rewarded the orchestra and Vonk
with warm applause.
