# Rampal, Lacroix Contribute Flair, Skill To Old Pieces

### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
An evening of flute and harpsichord sonatas
could bore even the hardened early music fan. But
Jean-Piette Rampal and Robert Veyron-Lacroix
bored few members of last Friday evening's
Dinkelspiel Auditorium audience in a magnificent
concert of Baroque and Classic masterpieces.
Stoutly-built, beaming M. Rampal — the rosette
of the Legion d'honneur gleaming on his lapel —
and slender, aging Veyron-Lacroix opened Friday's
musical offering with a Vivaldi sonata, Couperin's
fourth Concert Royal, and J.S. Bach's B minor
sonata for flute and harpsichord. Rampal and
Veyron-Lacroix are two of the world's most
renowned chamber music virtuosi, with strings of
educational, concert, and recording credits to their
names.
Each favors a careful, yet non-academic,
approach to works much of the musical world has
frequently ignored or forgotten, and each brings to
his instrument considerable technical skill and a
real flair for ornamentation.
Rampal's sweet tone and extremely facile
fingering were matched by Veyron-Lacroix's
capable keyboard work throughout Vivaldi's
Sonata in C Major. Couperin's Concert Royal
received even better treatment, with marvellously
rich harpsichord solos in the suite's "Sarabande,"
and an unusually graceful "Forlane en rondo."
In this latter movement Rampal's dulcet low
notes were complimented by Veyron-Lacroix's use
of his instrument's lute stop (which makes the
harpsichord sound like a plucked lute) in
scrumptuous combination.
Bach's B minor sonata, on the other hand

received a rapid, rigid performance, with both
musicians employing heavy tone and phrasing.
For their program's second half Messrs. Rampal
and Veyron-Lacroix played aTelemann sonata, two
early sonatas by Mozart, and Bach's G minor sonata.
Too many Baroque sonatas sound alike,
particularly when played closely together.
Fortunately, Rampal's virtuosity saved the day;
Telemann may be a bit dull on the page, but lovely
tone and passage work brought his some-what
pedestrian music to life.
The performances of eight-year-old Mozart's
pretty Sonatas in C and B-flat Major, K. 14 and 15,
raised another problem: the use of Stanford's
anacronistic harpsichord. A modern, steel-frame
instrument is merely ponderous in Vivaldi and
Couperin, but almost unbearably graceless in early
Mozart. A fine harpsichord similar to that used by
Margaret Fabri/.io in her recent Well-tempered
Clavier concerts would have lent considerable
appeal to these attractive pieces from Mozart's
childhood.
Bach's G minor sonata concluded the program in
a particularly intense performance that too often
hid both Rampal's and Veyron-Lacroix's phrasing
within a cloud of rapid notes. Rampal handled the
slow movement's beautiful melody marvellously,
but the concluding "Allegro" was unhappily
rushed.
Rampal and Veyron-Lacroix played four
encores, punctuated by wild applause and cheers:
an anonymous seventeenth-century set of variations
on "Greensleeves," "Entr'acte" by Jacques Ibert,
and two movements from Bach's Fifth Partita for
flute and harpsichord.

Bach's G minor sonata concluded the program in
a particularly intense performance that too often
hid both Rampal's and Veyron-Lacroix's phrasing
within a cloud of rapid notes. Rampal handled the
slow movement's beautiful melody marvellously,
but the concluding "Allegro" was unhappily
rushed.
Rampal and Veyron-Lacroix played four
encores, punctuated by wild applause and cheers:
an anonymous seventeenth-century set of variations
on "Greensleeves," "Entr'acte" by Jacques Ibert,
and two movements from Bach's Fifth Partita for
flute and harpsichord.


Jean-Pierre Rampal and Robert Veyron-Lacroix
An evening of flute and harpsichord sonatas
could bore even the hardened early music fan. But
Jean-Piette Rampal and Robert Veyron-Lacroix
bored few members of last Friday evening's
Dinkelspiel Auditorium audience in a magnificent
concert of Baroque and Classic masterpieces.
Stoutly-built, beaming M. Rampal — the rosette
of the Legion d'honneur gleaming on his lapel —
and slender, aging Veyron-Lacroix opened Friday's
musical offering with a Vivaldi sonata, Couperin's
fourth Concert Royal, and J.S. Bach's B minor
sonata for flute and harpsichord. Rampal and
Veyron-Lacroix are two of the world's most
renowned chamber music virtuosi, with strings of
educational, concert, and recording credits to their
names.
Each favors a careful, yet non-academic,
approach to works much of the musical world has
frequently ignored or forgotten, and each brings to
his instrument considerable technical skill and a
real flair for ornamentation.
Rampal's sweet tone and extremely facile
fingering were matched by Veyron-Lacroix's
capable keyboard work throughout Vivaldi's
Sonata in C Major. Couperin's Concert Royal
received even better treatment, with marvellously
rich harpsichord solos in the suite's "Sarabande,"
and an unusually graceful "Forlane en rondo."
In this latter movement Rampal's dulcet low
notes were complimented by Veyron-Lacroix's use
of his instrument's lute stop (which makes the
harpsichord sound like a plucked lute) in
scrumptuous combination.
Bach's B minor sonata, on the other hand

received a rapid, rigid performance, with both
musicians employing heavy tone and phrasing.
For their program's second half Messrs. Rampal
and Veyron-Lacroix played aTelemann sonata, two
early sonatas by Mozart, and Bach's G minor sonata.
Too many Baroque sonatas sound alike,
particularly when played closely together.
Fortunately, Rampal's virtuosity saved the day;
Telemann may be a bit dull on the page, but lovely
tone and passage work brought his some-what
pedestrian music to life.
The performances of eight-year-old Mozart's
pretty Sonatas in C and B-flat Major, K. 14 and 15,
raised another problem: the use of Stanford's
anacronistic harpsichord. A modern, steel-frame
instrument is merely ponderous in Vivaldi and
Couperin, but almost unbearably graceless in early
Mozart. A fine harpsichord similar to that used by
Margaret Fabri/.io in her recent Well-tempered
Clavier concerts would have lent considerable
appeal to these attractive pieces from Mozart's
childhood.
Bach's G minor sonata concluded the program in
a particularly intense performance that too often
hid both Rampal's and Veyron-Lacroix's phrasing
within a cloud of rapid notes. Rampal handled the
