# 'The Cowboys'—A Toned Down Western
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Second-season stuff on
television is usually pretty dreary;
the new show that premiered on
ABC Wednesday night is "The
Cowboys" based on the movie of
the same name that had big John
Wayne riding herd on a bunch of
boys and cattle — the only
question being would the cattle
get to market before the boys
became men?
The answer was no. It took
some mean hombres (with badass
Bruce Dern the meanest of the
bunch) to turn the bumbling boys
into rugged men. Dern killed
Wayne (shooting him in the back),
and the boys had to avenge the
Duke and get the cattle back.
They did, by shooting the
yellow-bellied varmints so full of
holes that Dern and Co. were dead
before they hit the ground.
So David Dortort (who
produced 14 years of "Bonanza")

thought he saw the makings of
another long-running series, with a
few changes for the sensibilities of
the middle-of-the-road viewing
audience.
The drinking the boys did in
the film would become nothing
stronger than apple cider, and the
shooting and killing would have to
go, too. But how, then, can the
boys survive?
Slingshots. Assuming that
every Western boy worth his salt
carried one and was as accurate as
an Australian bushman with a
boomerang is perfectly all right,
particularly if you want to put a
show on the airwaves and keep it
from being "violence-prone."
So why not seven young men
hired on by the widow of Wayne
to run his spread, armed only with
a bouyant spirit and sligshots?
And one thing more — don't think
for a moment these children are
neglecting their schooling. Not

with the trusty Mr. Nightlinger
around. Moses Gunn assumes the
role as the black chuckwagon
driver who speaks like an Oxford
don, gives the boys their lessons,
and convinces them to give up
their weapons.
All this happens in a half-hour
show, along with the vanquishing
of a couple of disgruntled former
hired hands who return to steal
the money from the cattle drive.
The bad guys are done in by a
barrage of rocks from slingshots,
followed by a half-dozen kids
pummelling the would-be robbers.
The most humorous thing
about the entire half-hour was
seeing DeForest Kelley (Dr.
McCoy of "Star Trek") as one of
the villians, being trussed up and
bitten on the ear by a bunch of
children. Such foolishness would
even make Mr. Spock laugh, and
the ghost of Hoss Cartwright
cringe.
