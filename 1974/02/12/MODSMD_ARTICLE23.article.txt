# 'Cyrano' Revives Romantic Theatre
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
With a script recapturing the
glamour and poetry of an earlier
age on one hand and a bit of nose
putty in the other, Peter Donat
and Cyrano made a triumphant
return to San Francisco in ACT's
opening night of Cyrano de
Bergerac at the Geary. It is
glorious to have them back.
Edmond Rostand's popular
heroic-comedy, written in 1897, is
a wonderful fusion of romantic
bravura, lyric love, and theatrical
craftsmanship. His style was a
rebellion from the heavy realism
and symbolism of French theatre
in the late 19th century, and a
reminder that there is room in the
theatre, indeed a definite need,
for romanticized beauty, wit, and
charm.
Its title role has long been a
favorite of actor and audience
alike. The swashbuckling Cyrano,
noble member of the Gascony
guard, is the very embodiment of
the Renaissance man. Swordsman
par excellence, he is undaunted by
a band of assassins 100 strong.
Equally a poet and philosopher
and brandishing a biting wit, he is
admirably suited to that noblest
of professions: as self-proclaimed

theatre critic he purges the
Bourgogne Theatre of its
histrionic, bombastic principal,
Montfleury. As the sensitive
idealist, Cyrano shuns hypocrisy
and courtly knee-bending and
pursues the perfect and the noble,
embodied in the beautiful
Roxane.
Alas! Cyrano's notorious nose,
which "marches on before me by
a quarter of an hour," gets in the
way, so to speak, of his heart's
desire. The noble Cyrano pours
out his heart and soul in wooing
Roxane for another, the
handsome but pathetically
inarticulate Christian de
Neuvillette. Even after Christian's
death, Cyrano selflessly maintains
his secret until he is discovered 15
years later in his dying hour.
The Proper Balance
Cyrano de Bergerac is heroic
comedy, but it is also bittersweet
or, more accurately, painfully
beautiful. It must have spectacle,
but also intimacy, hilarity as well
as tears, exultation and anguish,
but all in proper balance. Director
William Ball has shaped just the
proper amount of each of these
elements into a magnificent
whole.

ACT's general director and
guiding light once again has
enhanced a classic with his
insightful innovation. His major
motif is that of contrast, which he
accomplishes through the striking
use of tableaux. The opening
scene is explosive — the stage is
crowded, boisterous, frenetic,
colorful — a great sense of
occasion is established. Suddenly,
all freeze and attention is focused
upon the principals in spotlights,
serving to contrast the frivolity
and elan of the Hotel de
Bourgogne Theatre with the
heartfelt yearnings of Christian,
Roxane, and Cyrano. A further
contrast is offered between the
acts themselves. The spectacle of
the first act gives way to the
intimacy of the last, which finds
Roxane and Cyrano alone in a
corner of an empty stage with but
a single chair, a stool, and falling
leaves — a perfect setting for
Donat's subtly delivered but
extremely moving "Gazette."
The cast is uniformly good. A
great production of Cyrano can
afford no weak links and it is
among the repertoire system's
greatest advantages that even the
smallest roles are given attention

and polish.
Deborah May's Roxane was a
trifle disappointing; she was quite
moving in parts but she was not
internally consistent. She played
two different Roxanes. Her
transition from an almost
frivolous beauty who fell in love
with Christian's fair coutenance to
that sensitive soul who was won
over by Cyrano's impassioned
poetry was not, finally, credible.
Paul Shenar's Comte de
Guiche was great fun, and his
curtain call was, without
exception, the most perfect I've
seen on stage (that is if a curtain
call can be considered to be
within the critic's jurisdiction).
Panache
Ultimately, however, any
performance of Cyrano depends
upon its Cyrano and in this regard
the ACT production is
exceedingly strong. Peter Donat is
simply superb. Despite the fact
that on opening night Mr. Donat
was still recovering from illness —
his voice was raspy at times — he
delivered a richly virtu osic
performance, lending some
credence to the tradition of the

healing powers of "Doctor Stage."
He imbued his finely textured
Cyrano with all the necessary
components; he was arrogantly
courageous, yet soulfully
sensitive, he disdained the
hypocrisy and shallowness of his
society, yet admitted to moments
of loneliness, he was a man
without equal, yet, importantly,
he was very human. Donat's
Cyrano is unabashedly the
romantic hero, but he is far more
than Errol Flynn with a nose.
Rather, he is the very model of
panache.
In short, beg, steal, or borrow a
ticket to ACT's Cyrano. It is
romantic theatre at its finest, and
it is one of the more powerful
versions one's likely to see.
