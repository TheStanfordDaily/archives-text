# Pioneering In Electronics

### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO — The versatility of jazz
saxophonist Eddie Harris was shown all-too-well by
the five songs included in his first set Wednesday
night at Keystone Korner.
His quartet could more accurately be called a
sextet with only four members: Rufus Reed (bass);
Billy James (drums); Ronald Maldron (sic) on
guitorgan, an electronic device capable of making a
guitar sould like any number of instruments,
sometimes exactly like an organ; and Harris on
electric tenor and piano.
Harris is probably best known for his two
albums recorded with pianist Les McCann ("Swiss
Movement" and "Second Movement"), so many
people were no doubt surprised to see him sit down
at the piano for the first two tunes.
The group started in typical Harris fashion,
heavy-handed and powerful, in a fast
featuring an energetic solo by James.
This was folloWed by a beautiful slow ballad,
spotlighting the sounds of the guitorgan.
Harris picked up his tenor for a fine bossa nova
flavored tune, exhibiting his fine tone which,
although it is electric, still retains all of the better
qualities of the saxophone.
Switching to crazy bop at a fierce pace, Harris
evoked glimpses of the late Charley Parker.

During an extended break alone, Harris proved
that although he is considered an experimentalist
with electronics, he still knows where home is.
Harris' last number rounded out the show
perfectly, bringing things up to the present, so to
speak.
Reed switched to six-string electric bass (having
played a stand-up earlier), and Maldron applied a
wah-wah to his guitar. Harris set the mood on
electric piano, smooth and relaxed.
He threw all of his knobs, circuits, and switches
into play for his sax solo, executing a perfectly
timed build-up, climaxing with about a half dozen
saxes interweaving simultaneously while Harris
screamed through his horn.
Harris returned to the electric piano, with the
saxes still echoing over and over.
Harris, who in his own words, "usually don't say
shit," gave the audience what he referred to as his
"ego trip," explaining that he wasn't completely
satisfied with his equipment that night.
"Sometimes all this stuff works, sometimes it
doesn't. But, when you're pioneering like I am,
there's no one to copy from. And the easiest thing
to do in the world is copy."
Without a doubt, no jazzman has mastered
electronics to the degree Eddie Harris has.

Harris picked up his tenor for a fine bossa nova
flavored tune, exhibiting his fine tone which,
although it is electric, still retains all of the better
qualities of the saxophone.
Switching to crazy bop at a fierce pace, Harris
evoked glimpses of the late Charley Parker.

During an extended break alone, Harris proved
that although he is considered an experimentalist
with electronics, he still knows where home is.
Harris' last number rounded out the show
perfectly, bringing things up to the present, so to
speak.
Reed switched to six-string electric bass (having
played a stand-up earlier), and Maldron applied a
wah-wah to his guitar. Harris set the mood on
electric piano, smooth and relaxed.
He threw all of his knobs, circuits, and switches
into play for his sax solo, executing a perfectly
timed build-up, climaxing with about a half dozen
saxes interweaving simultaneously while Harris
screamed through his horn.
Harris returned to the electric piano, with the
saxes still echoing over and over.
Harris, who in his own words, "usually don't say
shit," gave the audience what he referred to as his
"ego trip," explaining that he wasn't completely
satisfied with his equipment that night.
"Sometimes all this stuff works, sometimes it
doesn't. But, when you're pioneering like I am,
there's no one to copy from. And the easiest thing
to do in the world is copy."
Without a doubt, no jazzman has mastered
electronics to the degree Eddie Harris has.
SAN FRANCISCO — The versatility of jazz
saxophonist Eddie Harris was shown all-too-well by
the five songs included in his first set Wednesday
night at Keystone Korner.
His quartet could more accurately be called a
sextet with only four members: Rufus Reed (bass);
Billy James (drums); Ronald Maldron (sic) on
guitorgan, an electronic device capable of making a
guitar sould like any number of instruments,
sometimes exactly like an organ; and Harris on
electric tenor and piano.
Harris is probably best known for his two
albums recorded with pianist Les McCann ("Swiss
Movement" and "Second Movement"), so many
people were no doubt surprised to see him sit down
at the piano for the first two tunes.
The group started in typical Harris fashion,
heavy-handed and powerful, in a fast
featuring an energetic solo by James.
This was folloWed by a beautiful slow ballad,
spotlighting the sounds of the guitorgan.
