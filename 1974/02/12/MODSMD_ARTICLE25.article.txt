### VICKI LaBRIE 
The music of Esther Phillips
and Dave Alexander inspired the
200 people at the Boarding House
last Thursday night to whoop and
clap to two different styles of the
blues.
Dave Alexander, a keyboard
man and a singer, began the
evening with an old standard
"Everything Happens to Me." His
technically proficient piano work
alternated between predictable
boogie woogie and blues.
Although his repertoire was blues,
most of the songs were happy and
humorous music that made the
audience clap their hands and tap
their toes. Included in the ten or
so songs he performed were
"Ebbtide," "Route 66," Chuck
Berry's "Reelin' and a Rockin',"
and the classic work song "Old
Man River" which began with the
verse in a dirge-like arrangement
and quickened at the chorus
punctuated with preposterous
crashing chord accents.
Esther Phillips' backup band —
organist Jeff Brown, guitarist
Mike Howard, drummer Kate
Neblitt, and couga player Kenny
Clarke, Jr. (son of the bop

drummer) — appeared and
warmed up with what resembled
an undistinguished
accompaniment to "Back
Stabbers" with no melody. They
turned their heads expectantly to
the wings and slid into "Alone
Again Naturally" as Esther's
unmistakable strident voice was
heard offstage. At the end of the
first verse, she emerged
dramatically in a stunning black
silvery-glitter dress, her hair pulled
back severely in a bunch of curls.
Although it appeared that
Esther was not in perfect health (a
recurring cough caused her to
sometimes leave the stage), it did
not hinder her performance. She
pleased the crowd with her singing
style — her diving and soaring

notes, her wailing, and her
improvising gave me goosepimples
— and understated sensuality.
Esther moved the audience
with a humming solo that ranged
from a grunt to a squeak in the
middle of "I have Scars on my
Knees," followed by solos on
drums, guitar, organ and congas
respectively which brought
applause and approving shouts
from the crowd.
The last and most dynamic
song "Use Me" enlivened the
audience even more. The response
was so strong it was as if Esther
was a preacher bringing the
congregation to a religious frenzy.
A standing ovation and a yellow
daffodil tossed to her brought her
back to finish the song.

Mike Howard, drummer Kate
Neblitt, and couga player Kenny
Clarke, Jr. (son of the bop

drummer) — appeared and
warmed up with what resembled
an undistinguished
accompaniment to "Back
Stabbers" with no melody. They
turned their heads expectantly to
the wings and slid into "Alone
Again Naturally" as Esther's
unmistakable strident voice was
heard offstage. At the end of the
first verse, she emerged
dramatically in a stunning black
silvery-glitter dress, her hair pulled
back severely in a bunch of curls.
Although it appeared that
Esther was not in perfect health (a
recurring cough caused her to
sometimes leave the stage), it did
not hinder her performance. She
pleased the crowd with her singing
style — her diving and soaring

notes, her wailing, and her
improvising gave me goosepimples
— and understated sensuality.
Esther moved the audience
with a humming solo that ranged
from a grunt to a squeak in the
middle of "I have Scars on my
Knees," followed by solos on
drums, guitar, organ and congas
respectively which brought
applause and approving shouts
from the crowd.
The last and most dynamic
song "Use Me" enlivened the
audience even more. The response
was so strong it was as if Esther
was a preacher bringing the
congregation to a religious frenzy.
A standing ovation and a yellow
daffodil tossed to her brought her
back to finish the song.
The music of Esther Phillips
and Dave Alexander inspired the
200 people at the Boarding House
last Thursday night to whoop and
clap to two different styles of the
blues.
Dave Alexander, a keyboard
man and a singer, began the
evening with an old standard
"Everything Happens to Me." His
technically proficient piano work
alternated between predictable
boogie woogie and blues.
Although his repertoire was blues,
most of the songs were happy and
humorous music that made the
audience clap their hands and tap
their toes. Included in the ten or
so songs he performed were
"Ebbtide," "Route 66," Chuck
Berry's "Reelin' and a Rockin',"
and the classic work song "Old
Man River" which began with the
verse in a dirge-like arrangement
and quickened at the chorus
punctuated with preposterous
crashing chord accents.
Esther Phillips' backup band —
organist Jeff Brown, guitarist
Mike Howard, drummer Kate
Neblitt, and couga player Kenny
Clarke, Jr. (son of the bop

drummer) — appeared and
