Energy-Consuming Nations Confer
WASHINGTON - A conference of 13
energy-consuming nations began cautiously
yesterday, seeking some way to agree on "rules of
conduct" for buying foreign oil without appearing
to threaten oil-exporting countries.
Opening the two-day conference, U.S. Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger said that bilateral oil
agreements by individual nations could not solve the
problems and might well make them far worse.
Kissinger also said "the United States is willing to
share available energy in times of emergency or
prolonged shortages.
Walter Scheel, West Germany's foreign minister
and president of the Council of European
Communities, urged a conference of all interested
nations — major consumers, producers, and
underdeveloped countries — by April 1, one month
earlier than proposed by Kissinger.
The conference participants have repeatedly
emphasized that they had no intention of making
this meeting into a conspiracy against the Arab
oil-producing nations which precipitated the world
crisis by cutting off deliveries to some countries last
October and by sharply increasing their prices.
Arab oil shipments have since been resumed to
most European countries but are still cut off to the
United States.
The secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries criticized the energy
conference in Washington yesterday, and said any
grouping of advanced consuming nations will lead to
"confrontation."
The official, Abderrahman Khene, told foreign
newsmen his organization had made it clear "that
the setting up of any kind of consumer group — any
group of powerful industrialized countries — will
inevitably lead to confrontation."

But he stopped short of specifying the kind of
retaliation his group would envisage should the
consuming countries form an organization to protect
their interests.
Truckers Abandon Shutdown
Despite pockets of resistance from militant
drivers, the majority of independent truckers
appeared yesterday to have abandoned their protest
shutdown against higher fuel prices.
After 11 violence-scarred days that left two
drivers dead, scores injured and 100,000 workers
temporarily without a job, truck traffic was
reported at near-normal levels in most states and
vital produce was rolling once more to market.
Officials of the New England Produce Center and
at several Midwest livestock markets reported
receipts close to or above prestrike levels. Truck
stops in a number of states began pumping diesel
fuel for the first time in a week.
Scattered incidents of violence continued,
however, and some drivers pledged to continue the
protest now or in the future, despite an agreement
reached last Thursday with officials in Washington.
Highway gunfire was reported early yesterday in
at least four states, and vandalism — mostly
shattered windshields — in several others.
W. J. Usery Jr., the Nixon administration's chief
labor negotiator, told newspersons that a survey by
the Department of Transportation showed truck
traffic had increased for the second straight day.
Brit ish Coal Strike Continues
LONDON — Miners formed picket lines in
driving rain and wind outside British coal mines
yesterday on the second day of a nationwide strike.
Meanwhile, union officials and a group of
industrialists met to discuss a compromise
arrangement increasing miners' pay if they return to
work.
The walkout against Prime Minister Edward
Heath's anti-inflation ceiling on wage raises started
at midnight Saturday, but the 280,000 miners had
not been working overtime and Sundays for three
months.
Heath initiated the Conservative party campaign
for the general election he called Feb. 28 with a
claim that victory would permit his government to
settle with the striking miners. Labor party leader
Harold Wilson said re-election of Heath's party
would mean continuation of policies that have
"brought Britain disastrously close to bankruptcy,
industrial paralysis and economic ruin."
In West Germany, 2.2 million public service
workers seeking higher wages went on selected
walkouts, snarling mass transit, airports, garbage
collection and street cleaning.
Syria Blasts Israeli Positions
Syrian artillery fire blasted Israeli military
positions and settlements yesterday along the
40-mile Golan Heights cease-fire line, killing two
persons and wounding five, the Israeli military
command announced. It said Israeli forces returned
the fire.
The Israeli authorities said the fighting lasted
about three hours in nearly all sectors of the Syrian
bulge captured by Israel in the October war.
The Golan battle was announced as Iraq and Iran
were reported reinforcing border outposts because
of a battle Sunday over disputed territory that

caused more than 140 casualties.
Yesterday's renewed fighting along the
snow-swept 40-mile Golan front coincided with
warnings by Israeli press commentators that Israel
might retaliate for recent Palestinian guerrilla raids,
and that some responsibility for the raids could be
laid on Syria.
A Tripoli radio broadcast monitored in Beirut
said Libya had totally nationalized the holdings of
three American oil companies there: Texaco Oil,
Asia-California Oil Co. and the Libyan-American Oil
Co.
The broadcast quoted an announcement
yesterday by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar
Khadafy. His government earlier had nationalized
the holdings of the American Bunker-Hunt firm and
took over 51 percent of the holdings of all other
major oil companies.
United States officials in Washington, meanwhile,
confirmed reports that the Nixon administration is
supplying sophisticated antitank missiles to Jordan,
the first Arab country to receive such U.S.
weaponry.
The TOW missiles are the same type dispatched
to Israel in the middle of the October war. The
officials declined to say how many would go to
Jordan.
Voluntary Rationing Begins
SAN JOSE — A voluntary alternate-day gasoline
rationing program based on license plate numbers
began yesterday in the Santa Clara Valley in an
effort to curb panic buying during the energy crisis.
The San Jose Chamber of Commerce and the
National Service Station Dealers Association, a local
group, announced plans for alternate-day rationing,
purchase limits and limited station hours similar to a
plan in Oregon.
Frank L. Apgar, dealer association spokesman,
predicted that between 80 and 90 percent of the
area's 1,500 stations would cooperate with the
rationing plan. He said similar programs are being
initiated in Salinas and Santa Cruz.
Reinecke Labels Rumors False
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke said
yesterday that somebody is out to get him with
false rumors about his involvement in the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.
antitrust case.
But Reinecke said he doesn't have any idea who
is behind the ITT rumors and added: "I have done
absolutely nothing wrong. There was no perjury."
Reinecke made the commetns in an interview
following his taking out of filing papers to enter the
race for the Republican nomination for governor.
Earl Brian, the golden boy of the Reagan
administration, entered the race for the U.S. Senate
yesterday promising to end the "machine-type
politics" of incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston.
The 32-year-old Republican, who resigned last
month from Gov. Ronald Reagan's cabinet,
emphasized his combination of youth and
experience as chief of the $6.5 billion Health and
Welfare Agency.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain. Rain
likely at times tonight then clearing tomorrow.
Lows tonight in 40s. Highs both days in mid 50s to
mid 40s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.

40-mile Golan Heights cease-fire line, killing two
persons and wounding five, the Israeli military
command announced. It said Israeli forces returned
the fire.
The Israeli authorities said the fighting lasted
about three hours in nearly all sectors of the Syrian
bulge captured by Israel in the October war.
The Golan battle was announced as Iraq and Iran
were reported reinforcing border outposts because
of a battle Sunday over disputed territory that

caused more than 140 casualties.
Yesterday's renewed fighting along the
snow-swept 40-mile Golan front coincided with
warnings by Israeli press commentators that Israel
might retaliate for recent Palestinian guerrilla raids,
and that some responsibility for the raids could be
laid on Syria.
A Tripoli radio broadcast monitored in Beirut
said Libya had totally nationalized the holdings of
three American oil companies there: Texaco Oil,
Asia-California Oil Co. and the Libyan-American Oil
Co.
The broadcast quoted an announcement
yesterday by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar
Khadafy. His government earlier had nationalized
the holdings of the American Bunker-Hunt firm and
took over 51 percent of the holdings of all other
major oil companies.
United States officials in Washington, meanwhile,
confirmed reports that the Nixon administration is
supplying sophisticated antitank missiles to Jordan,
the first Arab country to receive such U.S.
weaponry.
The TOW missiles are the same type dispatched
to Israel in the middle of the October war. The
officials declined to say how many would go to
Jordan.
Voluntary Rationing Begins
SAN JOSE — A voluntary alternate-day gasoline
rationing program based on license plate numbers
began yesterday in the Santa Clara Valley in an
effort to curb panic buying during the energy crisis.
The San Jose Chamber of Commerce and the
National Service Station Dealers Association, a local
group, announced plans for alternate-day rationing,
purchase limits and limited station hours similar to a
plan in Oregon.
Frank L. Apgar, dealer association spokesman,
predicted that between 80 and 90 percent of the
area's 1,500 stations would cooperate with the
rationing plan. He said similar programs are being
initiated in Salinas and Santa Cruz.
Reinecke Labels Rumors False
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke said
yesterday that somebody is out to get him with
false rumors about his involvement in the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.
antitrust case.
But Reinecke said he doesn't have any idea who
is behind the ITT rumors and added: "I have done
absolutely nothing wrong. There was no perjury."
Reinecke made the commetns in an interview
following his taking out of filing papers to enter the
race for the Republican nomination for governor.
Earl Brian, the golden boy of the Reagan
administration, entered the race for the U.S. Senate
yesterday promising to end the "machine-type
politics" of incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston.
The 32-year-old Republican, who resigned last
month from Gov. Ronald Reagan's cabinet,
emphasized his combination of youth and
experience as chief of the $6.5 billion Health and
Welfare Agency.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain. Rain
likely at times tonight then clearing tomorrow.
Lows tonight in 40s. Highs both days in mid 50s to
mid 40s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.
Energy-Consuming Nations Confer
WASHINGTON - A conference of 13
energy-consuming nations began cautiously
yesterday, seeking some way to agree on "rules of
conduct" for buying foreign oil without appearing
to threaten oil-exporting countries.
Opening the two-day conference, U.S. Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger said that bilateral oil
agreements by individual nations could not solve the
problems and might well make them far worse.
Kissinger also said "the United States is willing to
share available energy in times of emergency or
prolonged shortages.
Walter Scheel, West Germany's foreign minister
and president of the Council of European
Communities, urged a conference of all interested
nations — major consumers, producers, and
underdeveloped countries — by April 1, one month
earlier than proposed by Kissinger.
The conference participants have repeatedly
emphasized that they had no intention of making
this meeting into a conspiracy against the Arab
oil-producing nations which precipitated the world
crisis by cutting off deliveries to some countries last
October and by sharply increasing their prices.
Arab oil shipments have since been resumed to
most European countries but are still cut off to the
United States.
The secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries criticized the energy
conference in Washington yesterday, and said any
grouping of advanced consuming nations will lead to
"confrontation."
The official, Abderrahman Khene, told foreign
newsmen his organization had made it clear "that
the setting up of any kind of consumer group — any
group of powerful industrialized countries — will
inevitably lead to confrontation."

But he stopped short of specifying the kind of
retaliation his group would envisage should the
consuming countries form an organization to protect
their interests.
Truckers Abandon Shutdown
Despite pockets of resistance from militant
drivers, the majority of independent truckers
appeared yesterday to have abandoned their protest
shutdown against higher fuel prices.
After 11 violence-scarred days that left two
drivers dead, scores injured and 100,000 workers
temporarily without a job, truck traffic was
reported at near-normal levels in most states and
vital produce was rolling once more to market.
Officials of the New England Produce Center and
at several Midwest livestock markets reported
receipts close to or above prestrike levels. Truck
stops in a number of states began pumping diesel
fuel for the first time in a week.
Scattered incidents of violence continued,
however, and some drivers pledged to continue the
protest now or in the future, despite an agreement
reached last Thursday with officials in Washington.
Highway gunfire was reported early yesterday in
at least four states, and vandalism — mostly
shattered windshields — in several others.
W. J. Usery Jr., the Nixon administration's chief
labor negotiator, told newspersons that a survey by
the Department of Transportation showed truck
traffic had increased for the second straight day.
Brit ish Coal Strike Continues
LONDON — Miners formed picket lines in
driving rain and wind outside British coal mines
yesterday on the second day of a nationwide strike.
Meanwhile, union officials and a group of
industrialists met to discuss a compromise
arrangement increasing miners' pay if they return to
work.
The walkout against Prime Minister Edward
Heath's anti-inflation ceiling on wage raises started
at midnight Saturday, but the 280,000 miners had
not been working overtime and Sundays for three
months.
Heath initiated the Conservative party campaign
for the general election he called Feb. 28 with a
claim that victory would permit his government to
settle with the striking miners. Labor party leader
Harold Wilson said re-election of Heath's party
would mean continuation of policies that have
"brought Britain disastrously close to bankruptcy,
industrial paralysis and economic ruin."
In West Germany, 2.2 million public service
workers seeking higher wages went on selected
walkouts, snarling mass transit, airports, garbage
collection and street cleaning.

and president of the Council of European
Communities, urged a conference of all interested
nations — major consumers, producers, and
underdeveloped countries — by April 1, one month
earlier than proposed by Kissinger.
The conference participants have repeatedly
emphasized that they had no intention of making
this meeting into a conspiracy against the Arab
oil-producing nations which precipitated the world
crisis by cutting off deliveries to some countries last
October and by sharply increasing their prices.
Arab oil shipments have since been resumed to
most European countries but are still cut off to the
United States.
The secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries criticized the energy
conference in Washington yesterday, and said any
grouping of advanced consuming nations will lead to
"confrontation."
The official, Abderrahman Khene, told foreign
newsmen his organization had made it clear "that
the setting up of any kind of consumer group — any
group of powerful industrialized countries — will
inevitably lead to confrontation."

But he stopped short of specifying the kind of
retaliation his group would envisage should the
consuming countries form an organization to protect
their interests.
Truckers Abandon Shutdown
Despite pockets of resistance from militant
drivers, the majority of independent truckers
appeared yesterday to have abandoned their protest
shutdown against higher fuel prices.
After 11 violence-scarred days that left two
drivers dead, scores injured and 100,000 workers
temporarily without a job, truck traffic was
reported at near-normal levels in most states and
vital produce was rolling once more to market.
Officials of the New England Produce Center and
at several Midwest livestock markets reported
receipts close to or above prestrike levels. Truck
stops in a number of states began pumping diesel
fuel for the first time in a week.
Scattered incidents of violence continued,
however, and some drivers pledged to continue the
protest now or in the future, despite an agreement
reached last Thursday with officials in Washington.
Highway gunfire was reported early yesterday in
at least four states, and vandalism — mostly
shattered windshields — in several others.
W. J. Usery Jr., the Nixon administration's chief
labor negotiator, told newspersons that a survey by
the Department of Transportation showed truck
traffic had increased for the second straight day.
Brit ish Coal Strike Continues
LONDON — Miners formed picket lines in
driving rain and wind outside British coal mines
yesterday on the second day of a nationwide strike.
Meanwhile, union officials and a group of
industrialists met to discuss a compromise
arrangement increasing miners' pay if they return to
work.
The walkout against Prime Minister Edward
Heath's anti-inflation ceiling on wage raises started
at midnight Saturday, but the 280,000 miners had
not been working overtime and Sundays for three
months.
Heath initiated the Conservative party campaign
for the general election he called Feb. 28 with a
claim that victory would permit his government to
settle with the striking miners. Labor party leader
Harold Wilson said re-election of Heath's party
would mean continuation of policies that have
"brought Britain disastrously close to bankruptcy,
industrial paralysis and economic ruin."
In West Germany, 2.2 million public service
workers seeking higher wages went on selected
walkouts, snarling mass transit, airports, garbage
collection and street cleaning.
Syria Blasts Israeli Positions
Syrian artillery fire blasted Israeli military
positions and settlements yesterday along the
40-mile Golan Heights cease-fire line, killing two
persons and wounding five, the Israeli military
command announced. It said Israeli forces returned
the fire.
The Israeli authorities said the fighting lasted
about three hours in nearly all sectors of the Syrian
bulge captured by Israel in the October war.
The Golan battle was announced as Iraq and Iran
were reported reinforcing border outposts because
of a battle Sunday over disputed territory that

caused more than 140 casualties.
Yesterday's renewed fighting along the
snow-swept 40-mile Golan front coincided with
warnings by Israeli press commentators that Israel
might retaliate for recent Palestinian guerrilla raids,
and that some responsibility for the raids could be
laid on Syria.
A Tripoli radio broadcast monitored in Beirut
said Libya had totally nationalized the holdings of
three American oil companies there: Texaco Oil,
Asia-California Oil Co. and the Libyan-American Oil
Co.
The broadcast quoted an announcement
yesterday by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar
Khadafy. His government earlier had nationalized
the holdings of the American Bunker-Hunt firm and
took over 51 percent of the holdings of all other
major oil companies.
United States officials in Washington, meanwhile,
confirmed reports that the Nixon administration is
supplying sophisticated antitank missiles to Jordan,
the first Arab country to receive such U.S.
weaponry.
The TOW missiles are the same type dispatched
to Israel in the middle of the October war. The
officials declined to say how many would go to
Jordan.
Voluntary Rationing Begins
SAN JOSE — A voluntary alternate-day gasoline
rationing program based on license plate numbers
began yesterday in the Santa Clara Valley in an
effort to curb panic buying during the energy crisis.
The San Jose Chamber of Commerce and the
National Service Station Dealers Association, a local
group, announced plans for alternate-day rationing,
purchase limits and limited station hours similar to a
plan in Oregon.
Frank L. Apgar, dealer association spokesman,
predicted that between 80 and 90 percent of the
area's 1,500 stations would cooperate with the
rationing plan. He said similar programs are being
initiated in Salinas and Santa Cruz.
Reinecke Labels Rumors False
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke said
yesterday that somebody is out to get him with
false rumors about his involvement in the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.
antitrust case.
But Reinecke said he doesn't have any idea who
is behind the ITT rumors and added: "I have done
absolutely nothing wrong. There was no perjury."
Reinecke made the commetns in an interview
following his taking out of filing papers to enter the
race for the Republican nomination for governor.
Earl Brian, the golden boy of the Reagan
administration, entered the race for the U.S. Senate
yesterday promising to end the "machine-type
politics" of incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston.
The 32-year-old Republican, who resigned last
month from Gov. Ronald Reagan's cabinet,
emphasized his combination of youth and
experience as chief of the $6.5 billion Health and
Welfare Agency.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain. Rain
likely at times tonight then clearing tomorrow.
Lows tonight in 40s. Highs both days in mid 50s to
mid 40s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.
Energy-Consuming Nations Confer
WASHINGTON - A conference of 13
energy-consuming nations began cautiously
yesterday, seeking some way to agree on "rules of
conduct" for buying foreign oil without appearing
to threaten oil-exporting countries.
Opening the two-day conference, U.S. Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger said that bilateral oil
agreements by individual nations could not solve the
problems and might well make them far worse.
Kissinger also said "the United States is willing to
share available energy in times of emergency or
prolonged shortages.
Walter Scheel, West Germany's foreign minister
and president of the Council of European
Communities, urged a conference of all interested
nations — major consumers, producers, and

might retaliate for recent Palestinian guerrilla raids,
and that some responsibility for the raids could be
laid on Syria.
A Tripoli radio broadcast monitored in Beirut
said Libya had totally nationalized the holdings of
three American oil companies there: Texaco Oil,
Asia-California Oil Co. and the Libyan-American Oil
Co.
The broadcast quoted an announcement
yesterday by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar
Khadafy. His government earlier had nationalized
the holdings of the American Bunker-Hunt firm and
took over 51 percent of the holdings of all other
major oil companies.
United States officials in Washington, meanwhile,
confirmed reports that the Nixon administration is
supplying sophisticated antitank missiles to Jordan,
the first Arab country to receive such U.S.
weaponry.
The TOW missiles are the same type dispatched
to Israel in the middle of the October war. The
officials declined to say how many would go to
Jordan.
Voluntary Rationing Begins
SAN JOSE — A voluntary alternate-day gasoline
rationing program based on license plate numbers
began yesterday in the Santa Clara Valley in an
effort to curb panic buying during the energy crisis.
The San Jose Chamber of Commerce and the
National Service Station Dealers Association, a local
group, announced plans for alternate-day rationing,
purchase limits and limited station hours similar to a
plan in Oregon.
Frank L. Apgar, dealer association spokesman,
predicted that between 80 and 90 percent of the
area's 1,500 stations would cooperate with the
rationing plan. He said similar programs are being
initiated in Salinas and Santa Cruz.
Reinecke Labels Rumors False
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke said
yesterday that somebody is out to get him with
false rumors about his involvement in the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.
antitrust case.
But Reinecke said he doesn't have any idea who
is behind the ITT rumors and added: "I have done
absolutely nothing wrong. There was no perjury."
Reinecke made the commetns in an interview
following his taking out of filing papers to enter the
race for the Republican nomination for governor.
Earl Brian, the golden boy of the Reagan
administration, entered the race for the U.S. Senate
yesterday promising to end the "machine-type
politics" of incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston.
The 32-year-old Republican, who resigned last
month from Gov. Ronald Reagan's cabinet,
emphasized his combination of youth and
experience as chief of the $6.5 billion Health and
Welfare Agency.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with chance of rain. Rain
likely at times tonight then clearing tomorrow.
Lows tonight in 40s. Highs both days in mid 50s to
mid 40s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.
Energy-Consuming Nations Confer
WASHINGTON - A conference of 13
energy-consuming nations began cautiously
yesterday, seeking some way to agree on "rules of
conduct" for buying foreign oil without appearing
to threaten oil-exporting countries.
Opening the two-day conference, U.S. Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger said that bilateral oil
agreements by individual nations could not solve the
problems and might well make them far worse.
Kissinger also said "the United States is willing to
share available energy in times of emergency or
prolonged shortages.
Walter Scheel, West Germany's foreign minister
and president of the Council of European
Communities, urged a conference of all interested
nations — major consumers, producers, and
underdeveloped countries — by April 1, one month
earlier than proposed by Kissinger.
The conference participants have repeatedly
emphasized that they had no intention of making
this meeting into a conspiracy against the Arab
oil-producing nations which precipitated the world
crisis by cutting off deliveries to some countries last
October and by sharply increasing their prices.
Arab oil shipments have since been resumed to
most European countries but are still cut off to the
United States.
The secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries criticized the energy
conference in Washington yesterday, and said any
grouping of advanced consuming nations will lead to
"confrontation."
The official, Abderrahman Khene, told foreign
newsmen his organization had made it clear "that
the setting up of any kind of consumer group — any
group of powerful industrialized countries — will
inevitably lead to confrontation."

But he stopped short of specifying the kind of
retaliation his group would envisage should the
consuming countries form an organization to protect
their interests.
Truckers Abandon Shutdown
Despite pockets of resistance from militant
drivers, the majority of independent truckers
appeared yesterday to have abandoned their protest
shutdown against higher fuel prices.
After 11 violence-scarred days that left two
drivers dead, scores injured and 100,000 workers
temporarily without a job, truck traffic was
reported at near-normal levels in most states and
vital produce was rolling once more to market.
Officials of the New England Produce Center and
at several Midwest livestock markets reported
receipts close to or above prestrike levels. Truck
stops in a number of states began pumping diesel
fuel for the first time in a week.
Scattered incidents of violence continued,
however, and some drivers pledged to continue the
protest now or in the future, despite an agreement
reached last Thursday with officials in Washington.
Highway gunfire was reported early yesterday in
at least four states, and vandalism — mostly
shattered windshields — in several others.
W. J. Usery Jr., the Nixon administration's chief
labor negotiator, told newspersons that a survey by
the Department of Transportation showed truck
traffic had increased for the second straight day.
Brit ish Coal Strike Continues
LONDON — Miners formed picket lines in
driving rain and wind outside British coal mines
yesterday on the second day of a nationwide strike.
Meanwhile, union officials and a group of
industrialists met to discuss a compromise
arrangement increasing miners' pay if they return to
work.
The walkout against Prime Minister Edward
Heath's anti-inflation ceiling on wage raises started
at midnight Saturday, but the 280,000 miners had
not been working overtime and Sundays for three
months.
Heath initiated the Conservative party campaign
for the general election he called Feb. 28 with a
claim that victory would permit his government to
settle with the striking miners. Labor party leader
Harold Wilson said re-election of Heath's party
would mean continuation of policies that have
"brought Britain disastrously close to bankruptcy,
industrial paralysis and economic ruin."
In West Germany, 2.2 million public service
workers seeking higher wages went on selected
walkouts, snarling mass transit, airports, garbage
collection and street cleaning.
Syria Blasts Israeli Positions
Syrian artillery fire blasted Israeli military
positions and settlements yesterday along the
40-mile Golan Heights cease-fire line, killing two
persons and wounding five, the Israeli military
command announced. It said Israeli forces returned
the fire.
The Israeli authorities said the fighting lasted
about three hours in nearly all sectors of the Syrian
bulge captured by Israel in the October war.
The Golan battle was announced as Iraq and Iran
were reported reinforcing border outposts because
of a battle Sunday over disputed territory that

caused more than 140 casualties.
Yesterday's renewed fighting along the
snow-swept 40-mile Golan front coincided with
warnings by Israeli press commentators that Israel
might retaliate for recent Palestinian guerrilla raids,
and that some responsibility for the raids could be
laid on Syria.
