# P.A. Council Votes Aid To Poor Tenants
## 
### BILL ROSS 
A plan to help needy Palo Alto
residents pay the rent on their homes
was approved last night by the City
Council.
The council voted 5-2 to enter into
a contract with the Santa Clara
County Housing Authority. Under the
terms of the contract, Palo Alto will
provide the Authority with $50,000
during a three year period. In return,
the Authority will pay rent on the
homes of as many needy Palo Alto
residents as possible.
The Santa Clara County Housing
Authority is funded entirely by federal
funds except for the money pledged
by Palo Alto. Although it pays
landlords all of the rent on the homes
of the tenants whom it helps, the
needy tenants are expected to give the
Authority 25 percent of their net
income.
The contract between Palo Alto
and the Authority was originally
proposed two years ago by Sylvia
Seman, then a Council member.
"We were concerned about the fact
that Palo Alto kept talking about
housing but failed to do anything,"
Seman said. The contract will result in
concrete aid for needy residents and
since it is administered by the
Authority it won't add to the
bureaucracy of Palo Alto, she
explained.

The plan provides for a balance
between aid to families and aid to the
elderly, and it scatters the site
locations of units.
The authority is forbidden to
expend more than $15,000 per
calendar year or more than $45,000
during the three year term of the
agreement. The remaining $5000
provided for by the contract is
reserved as a contingency for the
possible phase out of the program
three years from now.
Councilman John V. Beahrs, who
with Richard Rosenbaum voted
against the contract, called the
program of rent assistance an example
of tokenism. He asserted that such a
plan needs a wider base of support.
Referring to $50,000 as 'peanuts,' he
argued that the contract is 'false
advertising' of Palo Alto's concern for
its poor.
"I agree that $50,000 isn't much â€”
I originally recommended that the
contract provide for twice that
amount," Seman said. "But $50,000 is
a lot better than nothing."
The plan includes specific
performance objectives and fiscal
controls, according to George Sipel,
Palo Alto city manager.
