Gerald Cantor has donated 88 pieces
of Rodin sculpture, the greater part of
his major private collection, to the
University's art department.
Cantor announced the gift,
described as "one of the largest
donations of sculpture ever received
by the museum world from a private
collector," at a press conference
yesterday at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. The Los Angeles
museum and the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City will receive
smaller numbers of the Rodin works.
Cantor's donation will "give the
Bay Area the greatest number of
Rodin works anywhere outside Paris,"
said Art History Prof. Albert Elsen, an
internationally known Rodin scholar,
"This is the kind of collection that will
attract visitors from all over the
world."
Combined with the 70 pieces
housed at the San Francisco Palace of
the Legion of Honor, and the five
works the University had previously,
the Bay Area will have more than 160
of the famed French artist's works.
Besides the 88 sculptures in bronze,
plaster and ceramic, Cantor has
donated many Rodin drawings, items
of the artist's personal memorabilia
and the major portion of the Cantor
reference library on Rodin.
The sculptures themselves include
some of Rodin's most famous works,
such as "The Kiss" and"The Naked
Balzac," as well as works completed just
before his death in 1917. The works
span more than 50 years.
Most of the sculpture given the
University will be housed in the newly
named B.G. Cantor Gallery, on the
ground floor of the Stanford Museum.

The University hopes eventually to
remodel or restore the entire south
rotunda of the museum to house the
Rodin collection. The larger pieces will
stand in an outdoor garden nearby.
The donation will be of exceptional
educational value, Elsen noted, giving
students the opportunity and
experience of working with actual art
objects and "contact with genuine
greatness." The University fosters the
most extensive Rodin research in the
world, he pointed out.
For the past four years the B.G.
Cantor Art Foundation has supported
several graduate students here,
allowing them to work closely with
Elsen on major Rodin exhibits and
publications. Through this foundation
Stanford students will be supported in
their Rodin studies for the next
decade.
Elsen and several students are
already preparing a mammoth
exhibition of all the Rodin sculpture
owned by Cantor for a National
Gallery of Art show in 1976 or 1977.
"This gift," said Elsen, "shows Mr.
Cantor's confidence in what a
university art museum can do with
such an impressive quantity of works,
and gives Stanford students a chance
to show what they can accomplish
given the art and funding."
Elsen noted that Cantor gave the
donation to Stanford rather than a
public museum because of the
specialization and resources possible
for permanent exhibition in the
Stanford Museum, which already has a
solidly established reputation in the
art world. The museum was built at
the same time Rodin lived and so its
architecture is representative of that
period.

The University hopes eventually to
remodel or restore the entire south
rotunda of the museum to house the
Rodin collection. The larger pieces will
stand in an outdoor garden nearby.
The donation will be of exceptional
educational value, Elsen noted, giving
students the opportunity and
experience of working with actual art
objects and "contact with genuine
greatness." The University fosters the
most extensive Rodin research in the
world, he pointed out.
For the past four years the B.G.
Cantor Art Foundation has supported
several graduate students here,
allowing them to work closely with
Elsen on major Rodin exhibits and
publications. Through this foundation
Stanford students will be supported in
their Rodin studies for the next
decade.
Elsen and several students are
already preparing a mammoth
exhibition of all the Rodin sculpture
owned by Cantor for a National
Gallery of Art show in 1976 or 1977.
"This gift," said Elsen, "shows Mr.
Cantor's confidence in what a
university art museum can do with
such an impressive quantity of works,
and gives Stanford students a chance
to show what they can accomplish
given the art and funding."
Elsen noted that Cantor gave the
donation to Stanford rather than a
public museum because of the
specialization and resources possible
for permanent exhibition in the
Stanford Museum, which already has a
solidly established reputation in the
art world. The museum was built at
the same time Rodin lived and so its
architecture is representative of that
period.

Gerald Cantor has donated 88 pieces
of Rodin sculpture, the greater part of
his major private collection, to the
University's art department.
Cantor announced the gift,
described as "one of the largest
donations of sculpture ever received
by the museum world from a private
collector," at a press conference
yesterday at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. The Los Angeles
museum and the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City will receive
smaller numbers of the Rodin works.
Cantor's donation will "give the
Bay Area the greatest number of
Rodin works anywhere outside Paris,"
said Art History Prof. Albert Elsen, an
internationally known Rodin scholar,
"This is the kind of collection that will
attract visitors from all over the
world."
Combined with the 70 pieces
housed at the San Francisco Palace of
the Legion of Honor, and the five
works the University had previously,
the Bay Area will have more than 160
of the famed French artist's works.
Besides the 88 sculptures in bronze,
plaster and ceramic, Cantor has
donated many Rodin drawings, items
of the artist's personal memorabilia
and the major portion of the Cantor
reference library on Rodin.
The sculptures themselves include
some of Rodin's most famous works,
such as "The Kiss" and"The Naked
Balzac," as well as works completed just
before his death in 1917. The works
span more than 50 years.
Most of the sculpture given the
University will be housed in the newly
named B.G. Cantor Gallery, on the
ground floor of the Stanford Museum.

The University hopes eventually to
remodel or restore the entire south
rotunda of the museum to house the
Rodin collection. The larger pieces will

Balzac," as well as works completed just
before his death in 1917. The works
span more than 50 years.
Most of the sculpture given the
University will be housed in the newly
named B.G. Cantor Gallery, on the
ground floor of the Stanford Museum.

The University hopes eventually to
remodel or restore the entire south
rotunda of the museum to house the
Rodin collection. The larger pieces will
stand in an outdoor garden nearby.
The donation will be of exceptional
educational value, Elsen noted, giving
students the opportunity and
experience of working with actual art
objects and "contact with genuine
greatness." The University fosters the
most extensive Rodin research in the
world, he pointed out.
For the past four years the B.G.
Cantor Art Foundation has supported
several graduate students here,
allowing them to work closely with
Elsen on major Rodin exhibits and
publications. Through this foundation
Stanford students will be supported in
their Rodin studies for the next
decade.
Elsen and several students are
already preparing a mammoth
exhibition of all the Rodin sculpture
owned by Cantor for a National
Gallery of Art show in 1976 or 1977.
"This gift," said Elsen, "shows Mr.
Cantor's confidence in what a
university art museum can do with
such an impressive quantity of works,
and gives Stanford students a chance
to show what they can accomplish
given the art and funding."
Elsen noted that Cantor gave the
donation to Stanford rather than a
public museum because of the
specialization and resources possible
for permanent exhibition in the
Stanford Museum, which already has a
solidly established reputation in the
art world. The museum was built at
the same time Rodin lived and so its
architecture is representative of that
period.

WINDFALL GIFT — Art Prof. Albert Elsen holds Rodin's study "The
Burghers of Calais." Beverly Hills banker B. Gerald Cantor has donated 88
pieces of the noted sculptor's work to the University's Art Department. See
related photographs, page six.
Beverly Hills investment banker B.
Gerald Cantor has donated 88 pieces
of Rodin sculpture, the greater part of
his major private collection, to the
University's art department.
Cantor announced the gift,
described as "one of the largest
donations of sculpture ever received
by the museum world from a private
collector," at a press conference
yesterday at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. The Los Angeles
museum and the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City will receive
smaller numbers of the Rodin works.
Cantor's donation will "give the
Bay Area the greatest number of
Rodin works anywhere outside Paris,"
said Art History Prof. Albert Elsen, an
internationally known Rodin scholar,
"This is the kind of collection that will
attract visitors from all over the
world."
Combined with the 70 pieces
housed at the San Francisco Palace of
the Legion of Honor, and the five
works the University had previously,
the Bay Area will have more than 160
of the famed French artist's works.
Besides the 88 sculptures in bronze,
plaster and ceramic, Cantor has
donated many Rodin drawings, items
of the artist's personal memorabilia
and the major portion of the Cantor
reference library on Rodin.
The sculptures themselves include
some of Rodin's most famous works,
such as "The Kiss" and"The Naked
Balzac," as well as works completed just
before his death in 1917. The works
span more than 50 years.
