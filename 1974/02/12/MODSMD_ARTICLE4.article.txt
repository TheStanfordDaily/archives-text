# Prof Criticizes Reaction To Syphilis Study
## 
### GEORGE TIBBITS 
Dr. Charles Barnett, emeritus
professor of medicine, has criticized
press and public reaction to the
Tuskegee Syphilis Study in which 399
black males were allegedly left
untreated for syphilis since 1932.
In an article in the current issue of
Stanford M.D., Barnett, a former
director of the Stanford Syphilis
Clinic, said that there is no

justification for the study to be
condemned as a "medical atrocity.
There remains no evidence," he said,
"that treatment was deliberately
withheld from the untreated patients."
An advisory panel to the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare censured the entire study last
year. The panel decided the Tuskegee
study was never justified, since there
was no evidence that informed consent
was obtained from the participants.
The panel also agreed that the study
should have ended when penicillin
became available in 1952.
Barnett argued that a report in
1964 showed that 96 percent of the
original untreated group had received
at least some treatment, and in 33
percent of the cases treatment was
considered to have been adequate.
It is highly probable, Barnett
maintained, that the subjects' failure
to get treatment "was by their own
choice."
Painful Therapy
When the study began in the 1930s
treatment for syphilis consisted of
dosages of arsphenamine, alternating
with injections of mercury or bismuth
for a period of 10 to 15 weeks. Such
therapy was often severely painful,
according to Barnett.
Because of this, he said, it was
often difficult to get a patient to
consent to the treatment, especially
when the disease was in its latent stage
and the patient showed no symptoms.
Barnett also objected to the belief
that antisyphlitic therapy, especially
with penicillin, always results in a
complete cure. "The fact is," Barnett
said, "that no amount of any kind of
treatment will always prevent the
development of later manifestations of
the disease."
By the time penicillin was
developed, the men in the untreated
group of the Tuskegee Study had cases
of syphilis that were at least 23 years
old. According to Barnett, most
patients with latent syphilis never
developed later forms of the disease,
and those who do generally do so
within 20 to 25 years.
Treatment Little Help
"The Tuskegee patients had lived
long enough with their infections to
show that almost all of them were in
the group who would never develop
late syphilis disease," Barnett said.
"There is little reason to suppose that
treatment with penicillin would have
changed the subjects lives."
Barnett agreed with the HEW
panel's criticism that the Tuskegee
Study was poorly planned, however.
The study's reports "generally are
concerned with limited aspects of the
study and often have no relation to
what was reported before," he said.
In an interview, Barnett specifically
mentioned as shortcomings the failure
of the study to include a control group

of treated patients and the researchers'
failure to separate syphlitic deaths
from deaths by other causes.
Treatment Uncommon
He also pointed out that it was
common not to treat for latent
syphilis before penicillin was available
because of the severe reactions
produced by arsphenamine and
bismuth or mercury and the lack of
conclusive evidence that it would
prevent late lesions. The Stanford
clinic stopped treating for latent
syphilis in the 19305, he said.

Stanford resumed treating patients
who had latent syphilis after penicillin
was developed. "Treatment during the
latent stage probably does some
good," Barnett said, "but we can't
prove it statistically."
Among the problems he cited in
gathering evidence for effectiveness of
treatment were the difficulty in
following cases for 20 or 30 years and
the fact that complete life histories of
persons treated with penicillin are only
now becoming available.
