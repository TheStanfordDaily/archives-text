# Shell Executive Asserts Oil Shortage To Continue
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Prices for petroleum and other
major energy sources "will be three
times more expensive than in the
past," Keith Doig said yesterday.
"Cheap, abundant energy ... is not
available anymore."
Doig, vice president of Shell Oil
Company, spoke before 200 people on
"U.S. Oil Supply in the Light of the
International Situation," in Skilling
Lecture Theater. He said the energy
shortage will be a problem long after
the Arab embargo ends. He attributed
the immediate crisis to the "peaking"
of domestic oil and natural gas
production in 1971 and 1972.
Doig said the present energy
shortage and consequent price
increases were inevitable. "We were
going to be in a jam, even if the Arab
embargo had not been imposed," he
said.
He added that without the
embargo, the shortage could have been
partly alleviated in three to four years
by constructing more refineries and
tankers.
He blamed the oil companies'
faulty predictions — Shell expected
1975 to be the year of peak
production — for lack of preparation
which intensified the oil shortage.
"We [Shell] thought there was
more time than we had," he said.
Domestic Decrease
Shell's projections of the nation's
supply and demand for energy indicate
that domestic oil will decrease in
importance as the United States
becomes more dependent upon more
expensive energy sources.
Imported oil will be of major
importance, Doig said. "In 1972 we
imported 4.7 million barrels of oil a
day. By the time of the embargo, we
were importing 6.7 million barrels a
day." Shell estimates that by 1990,
almost 50 percent of United States'
fuel will be imported.
Doig, who is in charge of Shell's
mining ventures, said that coal will
also increase in importance. However,

he added that "it takes a lot of effort
... to rejuvenate coal."
In some cases, Shell must wait five
years for delivery of vital mining
equipment before opening mines, he
said.
Arab countries can now supply the
world with all the oil it needs, Doig
said, but they will probably export a
much smaller amount.
Limit Exports
Changing their policies of the fifties
and early sixties, the oil-producing
Arab countries will limit exports in
order to productively reinvest profits.
How much of the profits they can
use will be the determining factor,
Doig said. Even if the Arabs want the
relatively high reinvestment rate of 10
percent — Japan's reinvestment rate in
the postwar era — oil production will
still be below world demand.
Reduce Demands
Doig said that the United States
cannot follow its path of projected
energy demands without serious
economic problems. The solution is a
reduction in the increase of these
demands.
"All of the things we are
experiencing now [energy
conservation measures] will
continue," he said.
He predicted the greatest savings in
energy needs will come from an
increase in the proportion of small,
good mileage cars.
Major Saving
Decrease in the projected demand
for commercial heating, cooling and
lighting will also be a major energy
saving and industry needs will
probably be less than projected.
Doig said that reliance on the profit
motive is the only way to meet
increasing energy demands.
"If we can't make sufficient profit
... we are not going to be able to
invest in this business and make it
expand," he said.
After the speech, he was asked
what the relationship between
government and the oil industry would
be in the future. "Hell," he replied.

Major Saving
Decrease in the projected demand
for commercial heating, cooling and
lighting will also be a major energy
saving and industry needs will
probably be less than projected.
Doig said that reliance on the profit
motive is the only way to meet
increasing energy demands.
"If we can't make sufficient profit
... we are not going to be able to
invest in this business and make it
expand," he said.
After the speech, he was asked
what the relationship between
government and the oil industry would
be in the future. "Hell," he replied.
Prices for petroleum and other
major energy sources "will be three
times more expensive than in the
past," Keith Doig said yesterday.
"Cheap, abundant energy ... is not
available anymore."
Doig, vice president of Shell Oil
Company, spoke before 200 people on
"U.S. Oil Supply in the Light of the
International Situation," in Skilling
Lecture Theater. He said the energy
shortage will be a problem long after
the Arab embargo ends. He attributed
the immediate crisis to the "peaking"
of domestic oil and natural gas
production in 1971 and 1972.
Doig said the present energy
shortage and consequent price
increases were inevitable. "We were
going to be in a jam, even if the Arab
embargo had not been imposed," he
said.
He added that without the
embargo, the shortage could have been
partly alleviated in three to four years
by constructing more refineries and
tankers.
He blamed the oil companies'
faulty predictions — Shell expected
1975 to be the year of peak
production — for lack of preparation
which intensified the oil shortage.
"We [Shell] thought there was
more time than we had," he said.
Domestic Decrease
Shell's projections of the nation's
supply and demand for energy indicate
that domestic oil will decrease in
importance as the United States
becomes more dependent upon more
expensive energy sources.
Imported oil will be of major
importance, Doig said. "In 1972 we
imported 4.7 million barrels of oil a
day. By the time of the embargo, we
were importing 6.7 million barrels a
day." Shell estimates that by 1990,
almost 50 percent of United States'
fuel will be imported.
Doig, who is in charge of Shell's
mining ventures, said that coal will
also increase in importance. However,

he added that "it takes a lot of effort
... to rejuvenate coal."
In some cases, Shell must wait five
years for delivery of vital mining
equipment before opening mines, he
said.
Arab countries can now supply the
world with all the oil it needs, Doig
said, but they will probably export a
much smaller amount.
Limit Exports
Changing their policies of the fifties
and early sixties, the oil-producing
Arab countries will limit exports in
order to productively reinvest profits.
How much of the profits they can
use will be the determining factor,
Doig said. Even if the Arabs want the
relatively high reinvestment rate of 10
percent — Japan's reinvestment rate in
the postwar era — oil production will
still be below world demand.
Reduce Demands
Doig said that the United States
cannot follow its path of projected
energy demands without serious
economic problems. The solution is a
reduction in the increase of these
demands.
"All of the things we are
experiencing now [energy
conservation measures] will
continue," he said.
He predicted the greatest savings in
energy needs will come from an
increase in the proportion of small,
good mileage cars.

Decrease in the projected demand
for commercial heating, cooling and
lighting will also be a major energy
saving and industry needs will
probably be less than projected.
