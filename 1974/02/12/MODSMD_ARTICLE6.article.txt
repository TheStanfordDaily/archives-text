## Row Housing 
### 
Last week's ballyhooed student referendum merely
confirmed what everyone knew all along: given a chance, a
good number of students will vote against the
administration's position on general principles.
This is not to deny the validity of that attitude. Indeed, if
one held to it consistently, one would almost surely be as
often right as wrong.
But as an index of informed student sentiment on the
particular issue of apartment construction on the Row, and
as a guide to the University in its reconsideration of policies,
the referendum was useless. Since, like all ASSU elections
and referenda, it cost money, it was an expensive luxury.
First, there was precious little "informed student
sentiment" to be gauged. Few controversies on this campus
have raged amidst such pervasive ignorance. Much of that
ignorance, it is true, was fostered by the University's
persistent failure to make relevant information public. Still,
there it was.
Second, the proposition's wording was ambiguous at best.
Maddeningly, it asked voters first to "support" or "oppose"
the Row project, then to "accept" or "reject" that
non-declaratory resolution. (It should not be too much to
ask of ASSU officials that they be fluent in English, but last
week's ballot raised serious doubts.)
Third, granting the massacre of grammatical convention,
for students to "support" or "oppose" the construction of
faculty housing on the site in question — if our puzzling out
of the ballot's hidden meaning is correct — is not all that
useful to the University officials who must now decide what
to do.
Did the referendum signify that students are
overwhelmingly opposed to any new construction on the
Row? To this project, but not a smaller one? To faculty
housing in general? The referendum offered no clues.
Nor did it offer any alternatives. As a useful index of
student opinion, and as a guide for those reassessing the
housing plans, it fares very badly.
Finally, the opinion of students at large need not
correspond with the feelings of those most directly affected
by the proposed construction: the residents of the Row,
faculty and students alike. It is they, not the nebulous
consistuency some call "the student body," who should
have been polled.
University officials are currently undertaking a review of
the project. We hope their conclusions will contribute
toward preserving the character of the Row. But we will not
demand that they comply with whatever last week's
referendum asked, for that would be a big red herring.

non-declaratory resolution. (It should not be too much to
ask of ASSU officials that they be fluent in English, but last
week's ballot raised serious doubts.)
Third, granting the massacre of grammatical convention,
for students to "support" or "oppose" the construction of
faculty housing on the site in question — if our puzzling out
of the ballot's hidden meaning is correct — is not all that
useful to the University officials who must now decide what
to do.
Did the referendum signify that students are
overwhelmingly opposed to any new construction on the
Row? To this project, but not a smaller one? To faculty
housing in general? The referendum offered no clues.
Nor did it offer any alternatives. As a useful index of
student opinion, and as a guide for those reassessing the
housing plans, it fares very badly.
Finally, the opinion of students at large need not
correspond with the feelings of those most directly affected
by the proposed construction: the residents of the Row,
faculty and students alike. It is they, not the nebulous
consistuency some call "the student body," who should
have been polled.
University officials are currently undertaking a review of
the project. We hope their conclusions will contribute
toward preserving the character of the Row. But we will not
demand that they comply with whatever last week's
referendum asked, for that would be a big red herring.
Last week's ballyhooed student referendum merely
confirmed what everyone knew all along: given a chance, a
good number of students will vote against the
administration's position on general principles.
This is not to deny the validity of that attitude. Indeed, if
one held to it consistently, one would almost surely be as
often right as wrong.
But as an index of informed student sentiment on the
particular issue of apartment construction on the Row, and
as a guide to the University in its reconsideration of policies,
the referendum was useless. Since, like all ASSU elections
and referenda, it cost money, it was an expensive luxury.
First, there was precious little "informed student
sentiment" to be gauged. Few controversies on this campus
have raged amidst such pervasive ignorance. Much of that
ignorance, it is true, was fostered by the University's
persistent failure to make relevant information public. Still,
there it was.
Second, the proposition's wording was ambiguous at best.
Maddeningly, it asked voters first to "support" or "oppose"
the Row project, then to "accept" or "reject" that
non-declaratory resolution. (It should not be too much to
ask of ASSU officials that they be fluent in English, but last
week's ballot raised serious doubts.)
