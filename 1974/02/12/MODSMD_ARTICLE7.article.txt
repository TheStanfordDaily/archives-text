Plagiarism
Editor:
I wish to clarify some
comments which appeared in the
Daily in an article entitled
"Plagiarism Charged, 'Research
Aids' Offered," on Jan. 29. A
statement was made that neither
last year nor so far this year has
the Campus Judicial Panel (CJF)
reviewed a case of student
plagiarism, but the students
charged have chosen to have the
cases adjudicated by the Dean of
Student Affairs, which is an
alternative to the CJP.
Plagiarism falls in the general
classification of an Honor Code
violation. Conduct which has been
found to violate the Honor Code
includes: such things as copying
from an examination paper of
another student; allowing another
student to copy from one's
examination paper; collaborating
with others in writing an
examination; receiving
unpermitted aid on an take-home
examination; and representing the
work of another to be one's own.
In 1972-73 the Dean of
Student Affairs heard three cases
dealing with plagiarism. For the
current 1973-74 academic year
the Dean has heard one case
involving plagiarism. In this latter
case, there were no mitigating
circumstances, and the plagiarism
was extensive. The Dean of
Student Affairs recommended and
the President of the University
approved that the student be
suspended for the 1973-74 Winter
Quarter.
In 1972-73 the CJP considered
an Honor Code case which
involved cheating on an
examination. The following is an
excerpt from the CJP opinion in
that case: "Briefly, we view
Honor Code violations as
extremely serious offenses for
which the normal penalty should
be separation from the
University." The actual sanction
in that case, in which they were
extensive mitigating factors,
consisted of suspension for one
quarter, with that suspension
being withheld on condition that
the sutdents involved receive no
academic credit for the course in
which the violation occurred.
With regard to plagiarism, it is
clear that the use of research or
term papers prepared by others
and represented as being the work
of the student submitting the
paper would constitute an Honor
Code violation.

Faculty Housing Facts
Editor:
Denis Cuffs article in the Feb.
6 issue of the Daily reporting on

action taken by "a University
subcommittee on faculty staff
housing" in regard to the "faculty
housing project on the row"
contains several misstatements of
fact.
The meeting Jim Friend was
referring to was that of the
University's Committee on Land
and Building's Sub-Committee on
Residential Development. Prior to
this year, it had been known as
the Sub-Committee on
Faculty-Staff Housing.
At its February 5 meeting, the
committee had on its agenda as a
regular business item, a status
report on the Emeriti-Faculty
Housing Project (faculty housing
project on the Row). It was not
placed on the agenda at the
request of President Lyman nor,
as the article reported, had the
President asked the committee to
re-evaluate plans for the project.
The committee did learn in the
process of the status report by Ed
Shaw, executive assistant to the
vice president and provost,that he
and Bob Summers, manager of
faculty-staff housing, were
undertaking a review of the
decision leading to siting of the
project on the former Stanford
Elementary School site. He said
this would be done insofar as
possible without prejudice from
past decisions and committee
actions, and that it would include
an objective look at the best
alternative sites.
The committee expressed great
interest in this review and asked
that it be provided with a better
knowledge of the demand for the
project and how this relates to
alternative sites, their costs and
availabilities as against aesthetics,
compatibility with any existing
neighborhood, proximity to
campus, open space needs, and
conformance with the University's
master plan. Ed Shaw indicated a
complete willingness to come
back to the committee for
discussion of these matters when
the review was completed.
The committee did not seek a
formal re-evaluation of plans for
the project. It simply recognized,
as have many others in recent
days, that questions have been
raised as to siting that merit
serious consideration. We were
convinced that the President and
his staff are giving them such
consideration and asked that they
share the results of their review
with the committee before a final
decision on siting is made.
I might add that in its
discussion of the matter, the
committee did not question the
need for emeriti-faculty housing,
nor the general thrust of the
planning done to date.
