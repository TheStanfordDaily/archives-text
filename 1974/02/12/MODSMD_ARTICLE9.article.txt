# Friend: Too Little, Too Late

Jim Woscher

Except for those students who feel
obligated to exercise their franchise at every
opportunity, few take the time to vote in an
ASSU election unless its outcome will
directly affect them.
Most observers attribute low turn-outs in
these elections to general student apathy, but
the official behavior of ASSU politicians is
also clearly a significant contributor to
students' disinterest in their so-called
government.
ASSU politicians, and most notably the
members of the Council of Presidents,
frequently fall victim to egoism, pettiness,
sanctimony and even outright hypocrisy.
A recent case in point is ASSU Vice
President Jim Friend's role in the controversy
surrounding the proposed construction of an
emeritus/junior faculty housing complex on
the Row.
Two weeks after the Board of Trustees
voted final approval of the complex, Friend
held a press conference and insisted that "the
Row is simply not the appropriate place" for
the housing complex, adding that the
complex would have a "very detrimental
environmental effect." Observers of recent
campus architectural feats could scarcely
argue with Friend, and it would have been
fine if he had stopped there.
Neat Verbal Trap
But Friend decided to keep right on
talking, and in doing so, set a neat verbal trap
for himself. The vice president complained
that the University Administration "has not
adequately sought student input," consulting
only "a handful of students some years ago."
What Friend conveniently neglected to
mention was that he, as a representative of
the student body and a resident of the Row,
had numerous opportunities to express his
dissatisfaction with the housing complex

before its construction was approved.
Nevertheless, he waited until four weeks
after the Trustees approved the project to ask,
"How can any 100-unit complex, complete
with parking and recreational facilities, not
ruin the appearance of the Row?"
Students On Regular Committees
The Board of Trustees has four regular
committees to which it invites members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents. According
to Robert R. Augsburger, the University's
vice president for business and finance,
Council members attending the committee
meetings may not vote, but are "able to
participate in terms of discussion."
Ever since the current Council of
Presidents took office in April last year,
Friend has attended the meetings of the
Trustees' Committee on Land and Buildings.
At its June and October 1973 meetings, the
committee either heard about or discussed
the construction of the housing complex on
the Row.
Neither Friend, nor the two regular
student members of the committee raised
any objections to the site selection.
Even if Friend is sincere in his opposition
to the housing complex, he seems to be
picking an odd time to mount a campaign
against it. Why, for instance, didn't he even
bother to show up at the Jan. 7 meeting of
the Trustees' Committee on Land and
Buildings, when the housing complex
proposal gained final approval?
If Friend had some legitimate reason for
missing that meeting, why didn't he make
sure that the regular student committee
members, David Durham and Lloyd Snook,
were present? In fact, neither attended the
meeting.
In a column on this page in the Feb. 5
Daily, Eric Hemel noted that several major
questions about the proposed complex could

have been answered "had students been
present when the various steps in the site
selection were made."
No Early Objections
Hemel's analysis couldn't be more correct.
But Friend was present at at least two
meetings when the site was discussed and he
neither asked those questions nor raised any
objections at those meetings. Apparently he
attached so little significance to the issue that
he failed to participate in the final
decision-making process for the housing
complex.
Now, only one month later, Friend wants
to institutionalize steps to bring more
student input into planning decisions. Why
bother when students don't even take
advantage of the opportunities for input
which they already possess?
Until Friend and others begin to take
advantage of these opportunities, Augs
burger was correct when he wrote to Friend
that the Administration "cannot be held
responsible if students choose not to involve
themselves or to respond."
Presidents Earn Salaries?
We pay each member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents a $60-a-month salary in
addition to the $450 quarterly tuition grant
each receives. Unless each member of the
Council does his best to represent the
viewpoint of the student body at every
opportunity, tha money is wasted. And you
can't represent anything if you don't attend
the meetings at which decisions are made or
speak up when you do attend.
People laughed when ASSU presidential
candidate Chris Hocker complained about
"sandbox politicians" in the ASSU. They
shouldn't be laughing any more.

complex.
Now, only one month later, Friend wants
to institutionalize steps to bring more
student input into planning decisions. Why
bother when students don't even take
advantage of the opportunities for input
which they already possess?
Until Friend and others begin to take

burger was correct when he wrote to Friend
that the Administration "cannot be held

Presidents Earn Salaries?
We pay each member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents a $60-a-month salary in
addition to the $450 quarterly tuition grant
each receives. Unless each member of the
Council does his best to represent the
viewpoint of the student body at every
opportunity, tha money is wasted. And you
can't represent anything if you don't attend
the meetings at which decisions are made or
speak up when you do attend.
People laughed when ASSU presidential
candidate Chris Hocker complained about
"sandbox politicians" in the ASSU. They
shouldn't be laughing any more.

Except for those students who feel
obligated to exercise their franchise at every
opportunity, few take the time to vote in an
ASSU election unless its outcome will
directly affect them.
Most observers attribute low turn-outs in
these elections to general student apathy, but
the official behavior of ASSU politicians is
also clearly a significant contributor to
students' disinterest in their so-called
government.
ASSU politicians, and most notably the
members of the Council of Presidents,
frequently fall victim to egoism, pettiness,
sanctimony and even outright hypocrisy.
A recent case in point is ASSU Vice
President Jim Friend's role in the controversy
surrounding the proposed construction of an
emeritus/junior faculty housing complex on
the Row.
Two weeks after the Board of Trustees
voted final approval of the complex, Friend
held a press conference and insisted that "the
Row is simply not the appropriate place" for
the housing complex, adding that the
complex would have a "very detrimental
environmental effect." Observers of recent
campus architectural feats could scarcely
argue with Friend, and it would have been
fine if he had stopped there.
Neat Verbal Trap
But Friend decided to keep right on
talking, and in doing so, set a neat verbal trap
for himself. The vice president complained
that the University Administration "has not
adequately sought student input," consulting
only "a handful of students some years ago."
What Friend conveniently neglected to
mention was that he, as a representative of
the student body and a resident of the Row,
had numerous opportunities to express his
dissatisfaction with the housing complex

before its construction was approved.
Nevertheless, he waited until four weeks
after the Trustees approved the project to ask,
"How can any 100-unit complex, complete
with parking and recreational facilities, not
ruin the appearance of the Row?"
Students On Regular Committees
The Board of Trustees has four regular
committees to which it invites members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents. According
to Robert R. Augsburger, the University's
vice president for business and finance,
Council members attending the committee
meetings may not vote, but are "able to
participate in terms of discussion."
Ever since the current Council of
Presidents took office in April last year,
Friend has attended the meetings of the
Trustees' Committee on Land and Buildings.
At its June and October 1973 meetings, the
committee either heard about or discussed
the construction of the housing complex on
the Row.
Neither Friend, nor the two regular
student members of the committee raised
any objections to the site selection.
Even if Friend is sincere in his opposition
to the housing complex, he seems to be
picking an odd time to mount a campaign
against it. Why, for instance, didn't he even
bother to show up at the Jan. 7 meeting of
the Trustees' Committee on Land and
Buildings, when the housing complex
proposal gained final approval?
If Friend had some legitimate reason for
missing that meeting, why didn't he make
sure that the regular student committee
members, David Durham and Lloyd Snook,
were present? In fact, neither attended the
meeting.
In a column on this page in the Feb. 5
Daily, Eric Hemel noted that several major
questions about the proposed complex could

have been answered "had students been
present when the various steps in the site
selection were made."
No Early Objections
Hemel's analysis couldn't be more correct.
But Friend was present at at least two
meetings when the site was discussed and he
neither asked those questions nor raised any
objections at those meetings. Apparently he
attached so little significance to the issue that
he failed to participate in the final
decision-making process for the housing
complex.

any objections to the site selection.
Even if Friend is sincere in his opposition
to the housing complex, he seems to be
picking an odd time to mount a campaign
against it. Why, for instance, didn't he even
bother to show up at the Jan. 7 meeting of
the Trustees' Committee on Land and
Buildings, when the housing complex
proposal gained final approval?
If Friend had some legitimate reason for
missing that meeting, why didn't he make
sure that the regular student committee
members, David Durham and Lloyd Snook,
were present? In fact, neither attended the
meeting.
In a column on this page in the Feb. 5
Daily, Eric Hemel noted that several major
questions about the proposed complex could

have been answered "had students been
present when the various steps in the site
selection were made."
No Early Objections
Hemel's analysis couldn't be more correct.
But Friend was present at at least two
meetings when the site was discussed and he
neither asked those questions nor raised any
objections at those meetings. Apparently he
attached so little significance to the issue that
he failed to participate in the final
decision-making process for the housing
complex.
Now, only one month later, Friend wants
to institutionalize steps to bring more
student input into planning decisions. Why
bother when students don't even take
advantage of the opportunities for input
which they already possess?
Until Friend and others begin to take
advantage of these opportunities, Augs
burger was correct when he wrote to Friend
that the Administration "cannot be held
responsible if students choose not to involve
themselves or to respond."
Presidents Earn Salaries?
We pay each member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents a $60-a-month salary in
addition to the $450 quarterly tuition grant
each receives. Unless each member of the
Council does his best to represent the
viewpoint of the student body at every
opportunity, tha money is wasted. And you
can't represent anything if you don't attend
the meetings at which decisions are made or
speak up when you do attend.
People laughed when ASSU presidential
candidate Chris Hocker complained about
"sandbox politicians" in the ASSU. They
shouldn't be laughing any more.

Except for those students who feel
obligated to exercise their franchise at every
opportunity, few take the time to vote in an
ASSU election unless its outcome will
directly affect them.
Most observers attribute low turn-outs in
these elections to general student apathy, but
the official behavior of ASSU politicians is
also clearly a significant contributor to
students' disinterest in their so-called
government.
ASSU politicians, and most notably the
members of the Council of Presidents,
frequently fall victim to egoism, pettiness,
sanctimony and even outright hypocrisy.
A recent case in point is ASSU Vice
President Jim Friend's role in the controversy
surrounding the proposed construction of an
emeritus/junior faculty housing complex on
the Row.
Two weeks after the Board of Trustees
voted final approval of the complex, Friend
held a press conference and insisted that "the
Row is simply not the appropriate place" for
the housing complex, adding that the
complex would have a "very detrimental
environmental effect." Observers of recent
campus architectural feats could scarcely
argue with Friend, and it would have been
fine if he had stopped there.
Neat Verbal Trap
But Friend decided to keep right on
talking, and in doing so, set a neat verbal trap
for himself. The vice president complained
that the University Administration "has not
adequately sought student input," consulting
only "a handful of students some years ago."
What Friend conveniently neglected to
mention was that he, as a representative of
the student body and a resident of the Row,
had numerous opportunities to express his
dissatisfaction with the housing complex

before its construction was approved.
Nevertheless, he waited until four weeks
after the Trustees approved the project to ask,
"How can any 100-unit complex, complete
with parking and recreational facilities, not
ruin the appearance of the Row?"
Students On Regular Committees
The Board of Trustees has four regular
committees to which it invites members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents. According
to Robert R. Augsburger, the University's
vice president for business and finance,
Council members attending the committee
meetings may not vote, but are "able to
participate in terms of discussion."
Ever since the current Council of
Presidents took office in April last year,
Friend has attended the meetings of the
Trustees' Committee on Land and Buildings.
At its June and October 1973 meetings, the
committee either heard about or discussed
the construction of the housing complex on
the Row.
Neither Friend, nor the two regular
student members of the committee raised
any objections to the site selection.
Even if Friend is sincere in his opposition
to the housing complex, he seems to be
picking an odd time to mount a campaign
against it. Why, for instance, didn't he even
