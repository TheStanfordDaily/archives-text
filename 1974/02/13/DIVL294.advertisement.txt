A career in law—
without law school.
What can you do with only a bachelor's degree?
Now there is a way to bridge the gap between an
undergraduate education and a challenging, respon
sible career. The Lawyer's Assistant is able to do
work traditionally done by lawyers.
Three months of intensive training can give you
the skills —the courses are taught by lawyers. You
choose one of the six courses offered —choose the
city in which you want to work.
Since 1970, The Institute for Paralegal Training
has placed more than 500 graduates in law firms,
banks, and corporations in over 40 cities.
If you are a student of high academic standing and
are interested in a career as a Lawyer's Assistant,
we'd like to meet you.
Contact your placement office for an interview with
our representative.
We will visit your campus on
TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19
