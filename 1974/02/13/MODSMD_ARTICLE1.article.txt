# Franklin Takes Post At Eastern College
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Fired Stanford English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin plans to accept an
offer from Wesleyan University to be a
visiting fellow at its Center for the
Humanities for the autumn 1971 term.
Wesleyan is located in Middletown,
Conn.
The Board of Trustees here fired
Franklin in January, 1972, after the
Faculty Advisory Board found him
guilty of "urging and inciting to the
use of illegal coercion and violence"
during campus disturbances in 1971.
Hayden White, the director of the
Wesleyan Center, said the program "is
a center for advanced study of
problems that might be of interest to
people involved in humanistic
studies." According to White, the
topic for autumn of this year is "Art
and Criminality."
Although he refused to disclose a
specific salary figure, Franklin said he
would be paid more at Wesleyan than
he was as an associate professor here.
Franklin compared Weslevan's
Center for the Humanities to the
Center for Advanced Study of the
Behavioral Sciences here, but said the
Wesleyan program is directly affiliated
with the university there, unlike the
Behavioral Sciences Center.
Criminality
Because of the program's official
ties with the university, Franklin said
he would be responsible for
conducting a seminar on "Art and
Criminality." He said the seminar
"might focus on Melville," about
whom Franklin has authored a book.
"Melville himself was a criminal,"
Franklin points out.
White said that officials at Wesleyan
were aware of Franklin's disciplinary
record at Stanford, but added that it
did not figure prominently in their
consideration of his nomination for
the position. Franklin was one of four
people selected from among 60
nominees from outside the Weslpyan
community.
"We all knew of Franklin's
problem," White said, but his record
indicates that "he's first-rate and that's
the reason we want him."
Academic Jobs
Franklin, who will conclude his
horticulture studies at the College of
San Mateo in June, said he has "some
very good prospects for academic
jobs."
According to Franklin, he has
already visited several universities and
been enthusiastically received by the
English Department faculties there. He
said several departments had voted

"overwhelmingly" to recommend that
he be hired.
However, Franklin asserted that
certain key administrators at these
universities were seeking to block his
hiring. Franklin also charged that
several administrators and others here
have been "very active in trying to
prevent me from getting a job."
Confidential Referrals
Assistant to the President William
E. Stone said yesterday that he knew
of no concerted effort directed by the
University against Franklin since his
firing. But, he added "the referral
process for faculty is about as
confidential as it is for student
admissions applications."
Arthur I. Bienenstock, vice provost
for faculty affairs, said he had not
heard of any contacts initiated by
Stanford that were designed to keep
Franklin from obtaining a permanent
academic position. "Personally,"
Bienenstock said, "I would be really
surprised if we did anything like that."
