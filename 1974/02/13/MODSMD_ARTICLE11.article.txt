# Lies, Damn Lies, And Statistics'

Just how hard is it to get into Stanford?
The common wisdom has it ranked just
under passing a camel through the eye of a
needle.
But a close look at the University's own
figures puts the chances of those who applied
for admission two years ago — this year's
sophomores, in other words — at about one
in three. To be precise, 31.7 percent, a good
deal more than commonly believed.
As with so many things, it all depends on
which numbers you elect to juggle. The
juggling of numbers is often vital to the good
health of a bureaucracy. Among college
admissions officers, juggling numbers to
make admissions sound like an intellectual
Irish Sweeps seems an ancient and honored
tradition.
Benefits Apparent
The benefits are apparent: it elevates the
importance of the admissions office's job by
making its task sound well-nigh Augean;
scares away less qualified, and less audacious
applicants, thus reducing the office's
workload; and, in general, makes everyone on
the campus happy by reassuring them that
they do, indeed, represent the "chosen few"
of the clever middle class.
Not one to buck ancient and honored
tradition, our own Dean Fred Hargadon
dragged out the moth-eaten ciphers last
Thursday. Hargadon, who has spent the
better part of his career presiding over
high-schoolers' tremulous applications with a
flinty eye and a witty tongue, spoke in the
"Everything You Always Wanted To Know
About Stanford" lecture series, one of this
institution's less graceful exercises in
breaking its arm patting its own back.
Hargadon and his audience both doubtless
enjoyed the gasps of surprise, awe, and
delight his numerologies elicited. I quote
from the Daily of Friday last:
"Hargadon noted that 9300 applications
were received for 1470 places in last year's
freshman class."

Zowie!
Hot dog!
Why, that's 6.33 trembling adolescents per
coveted spot!
Audience Gobbled It
It's also one of the fudgiest, most Mickey
Mouse numbers ever lobbed into a lecture
audience. The audience gobbled it with
equanimity. The readers of this newspaper,
being a less gullible lot, deserve better. Here
goes.
Let's begin with the big number: 9300. It
conjures up lurid images of deans knee-deep
in high school transcripts, tidal waves of
manila envelopes surging through the
admissions office door, right?
Not so.
Hargadon cited the figure for last year's
freshman class — the class of 1976, which
was admitted in early 1972.
Luckily, the provost's office prepared an
extensive report on the admissions process
for just that year. 'The group of
approximately 9000 applicants," the report
noted, includes "incomplete applications."
How many complete applications were
there? 7617.
Does the admissions office consider
incomplete applications? No.
Figure 9300 Invalid
Is the figure of 9300 valid for any
practical purposes? No. If the intention of
this statistical mumbo-jumbo is to convey the
difficulty of gaining admission to this great
institution, "9300" is meaningless; nobody's
competing against the poor saps who didn't
complete their applications.
A fact, of course, of which Hargadon is
well aware. "If [the Admissions Office] gets
more t'.an a name and address, they count it
as an application," one provost's aide told me
last year.
So there weren't 9300 applicants; there
were, for our purposes, 7617. What about the

number of places available — surely it can't
be fudged?
Well, not fudged, perhaps; but it would
have been easy for the casual auditor to come
away Thursday with an impression as grossly
inaccurate as the canard about the applicants.
Hargardon, you see, said there were 1470
places in last year's freshman class; and there
were. But the figure of importance is not the
simple number of places, but the number of
"offers of admission" that go out. Since
many of those accepted decide, inexplicably,
to attend some lesser school, the admissions
office accepts far more than 1470 putative
freshmen — in order to ensure the appearance
of around 1470 actual freshmen.
New Number More Significant
In 1972, the number of offers was 2415.
Obviously, if our eventual purpose is to
determine how difficult it is to get into
Stanford, that number — the number of
applicants given the opportunity to enroll —
is the significant one.
Now we have two new numbers: 7617 and
2415. Together, they mean only 3.15 real
applicants per real admittee — half our
original figure. Or, perhaps more graphically,
they mean that no less than 31.7 percent of
the applicants who complete their
applications are offered admission.
More than you thought, right?
None of this need suggest Dean Hargadon
was consciously dissembling last Thursday.
His intentions were surely good, his motives
surely pure. And his statistics, taken
separately, were as accurate as can be.
Taken together, they suggest an
impression that is just about dead wrong.
As Mark Twain, clearer of mind than most
of us, wrote: 'There are lies; damn lies; and
statistics."

freshmen — in order to ensure the appearance
of around 1470 actual freshmen.
New Number More Significant
In 1972, the number of offers was 2415.
Obviously, if our eventual purpose is to
determine how difficult it is to get into
Stanford, that number — the number of
applicants given the opportunity to enroll —
is the significant one.
Now we have two new numbers: 7617 and
2415. Together, they mean only 3.15 real
applicants per real admittee — half our
original figure. Or, perhaps more graphically,
they mean that no less than 31.7 percent of
the applicants who complete their
applications are offered admission.
More than you thought, right?
None of this need suggest Dean Hargadon
was consciously dissembling last Thursday.
His intentions were surely good, his motives
surely pure. And his statistics, taken
separately, were as accurate as can be.
Taken together, they suggest an
impression that is just about dead wrong.
As Mark Twain, clearer of mind than most
of us, wrote: 'There are lies; damn lies; and
statistics."

Just how hard is it to get into Stanford?
The common wisdom has it ranked just
under passing a camel through the eye of a
needle.
But a close look at the University's own
figures puts the chances of those who applied
for admission two years ago — this year's
sophomores, in other words — at about one
in three. To be precise, 31.7 percent, a good
deal more than commonly believed.
As with so many things, it all depends on
which numbers you elect to juggle. The
juggling of numbers is often vital to the good
health of a bureaucracy. Among college
admissions officers, juggling numbers to
make admissions sound like an intellectual
Irish Sweeps seems an ancient and honored
tradition.
Benefits Apparent
The benefits are apparent: it elevates the
importance of the admissions office's job by
making its task sound well-nigh Augean;
scares away less qualified, and less audacious
applicants, thus reducing the office's
workload; and, in general, makes everyone on
the campus happy by reassuring them that
they do, indeed, represent the "chosen few"
of the clever middle class.
Not one to buck ancient and honored
tradition, our own Dean Fred Hargadon
dragged out the moth-eaten ciphers last
Thursday. Hargadon, who has spent the
better part of his career presiding over
high-schoolers' tremulous applications with a
flinty eye and a witty tongue, spoke in the
"Everything You Always Wanted To Know
About Stanford" lecture series, one of this
institution's less graceful exercises in
breaking its arm patting its own back.
Hargadon and his audience both doubtless
enjoyed the gasps of surprise, awe, and
delight his numerologies elicited. I quote
from the Daily of Friday last:
"Hargadon noted that 9300 applications
were received for 1470 places in last year's
freshman class."

Zowie!
Hot dog!
Why, that's 6.33 trembling adolescents per
coveted spot!
Audience Gobbled It
It's also one of the fudgiest, most Mickey
Mouse numbers ever lobbed into a lecture
audience. The audience gobbled it with
equanimity. The readers of this newspaper,
being a less gullible lot, deserve better. Here
goes.
Let's begin with the big number: 9300. It
conjures up lurid images of deans knee-deep
in high school transcripts, tidal waves of
manila envelopes surging through the
admissions office door, right?
Not so.
Hargadon cited the figure for last year's
freshman class — the class of 1976, which
was admitted in early 1972.
Luckily, the provost's office prepared an
extensive report on the admissions process
for just that year. 'The group of
approximately 9000 applicants," the report
noted, includes "incomplete applications."
How many complete applications were
there? 7617.
Does the admissions office consider
incomplete applications? No.
Figure 9300 Invalid
Is the figure of 9300 valid for any
practical purposes? No. If the intention of
this statistical mumbo-jumbo is to convey the
difficulty of gaining admission to this great
institution, "9300" is meaningless; nobody's
competing against the poor saps who didn't
complete their applications.
A fact, of course, of which Hargadon is
well aware. "If [the Admissions Office] gets
more t'.an a name and address, they count it
as an application," one provost's aide told me
last year.
So there weren't 9300 applicants; there
were, for our purposes, 7617. What about the

number of places available — surely it can't
be fudged?
Well, not fudged, perhaps; but it would
have been easy for the casual auditor to come
away Thursday with an impression as grossly
inaccurate as the canard about the applicants.
Hargardon, you see, said there were 1470
places in last year's freshman class; and there
were. But the figure of importance is not the
simple number of places, but the number of
"offers of admission" that go out. Since
many of those accepted decide, inexplicably,
to attend some lesser school, the admissions
office accepts far more than 1470 putative
freshmen — in order to ensure the appearance
of around 1470 actual freshmen.

practical purposes? No. If the intention of
this statistical mumbo-jumbo is to convey the
difficulty of gaining admission to this great
institution, "9300" is meaningless; nobody's
competing against the poor saps who didn't
complete their applications.
A fact, of course, of which Hargadon is
well aware. "If [the Admissions Office] gets
more t'.an a name and address, they count it
as an application," one provost's aide told me
last year.
So there weren't 9300 applicants; there
were, for our purposes, 7617. What about the

number of places available — surely it can't
be fudged?
Well, not fudged, perhaps; but it would
have been easy for the casual auditor to come
away Thursday with an impression as grossly
inaccurate as the canard about the applicants.
Hargardon, you see, said there were 1470
places in last year's freshman class; and there
were. But the figure of importance is not the
simple number of places, but the number of
"offers of admission" that go out. Since
many of those accepted decide, inexplicably,
to attend some lesser school, the admissions
office accepts far more than 1470 putative
freshmen — in order to ensure the appearance
of around 1470 actual freshmen.
New Number More Significant
In 1972, the number of offers was 2415.
Obviously, if our eventual purpose is to
determine how difficult it is to get into
Stanford, that number — the number of
applicants given the opportunity to enroll —
is the significant one.
Now we have two new numbers: 7617 and
2415. Together, they mean only 3.15 real
applicants per real admittee — half our
original figure. Or, perhaps more graphically,
they mean that no less than 31.7 percent of
the applicants who complete their
applications are offered admission.
More than you thought, right?
None of this need suggest Dean Hargadon
was consciously dissembling last Thursday.
His intentions were surely good, his motives
surely pure. And his statistics, taken
separately, were as accurate as can be.
Taken together, they suggest an
impression that is just about dead wrong.
As Mark Twain, clearer of mind than most
of us, wrote: 'There are lies; damn lies; and
statistics."

Just how hard is it to get into Stanford?
The common wisdom has it ranked just
under passing a camel through the eye of a
needle.
But a close look at the University's own
figures puts the chances of those who applied
for admission two years ago — this year's
sophomores, in other words — at about one
in three. To be precise, 31.7 percent, a good
deal more than commonly believed.
As with so many things, it all depends on
which numbers you elect to juggle. The
juggling of numbers is often vital to the good
health of a bureaucracy. Among college
admissions officers, juggling numbers to
make admissions sound like an intellectual
Irish Sweeps seems an ancient and honored
tradition.
Benefits Apparent
The benefits are apparent: it elevates the
importance of the admissions office's job by
making its task sound well-nigh Augean;
scares away less qualified, and less audacious
applicants, thus reducing the office's
workload; and, in general, makes everyone on
the campus happy by reassuring them that
they do, indeed, represent the "chosen few"
of the clever middle class.
Not one to buck ancient and honored
tradition, our own Dean Fred Hargadon
dragged out the moth-eaten ciphers last
Thursday. Hargadon, who has spent the
better part of his career presiding over
high-schoolers' tremulous applications with a
flinty eye and a witty tongue, spoke in the
"Everything You Always Wanted To Know
About Stanford" lecture series, one of this
institution's less graceful exercises in
breaking its arm patting its own back.
Hargadon and his audience both doubtless
enjoyed the gasps of surprise, awe, and
delight his numerologies elicited. I quote
from the Daily of Friday last:
"Hargadon noted that 9300 applications
were received for 1470 places in last year's
freshman class."

Zowie!
Hot dog!
Why, that's 6.33 trembling adolescents per
coveted spot!
Audience Gobbled It
It's also one of the fudgiest, most Mickey
Mouse numbers ever lobbed into a lecture
audience. The audience gobbled it with
equanimity. The readers of this newspaper,
being a less gullible lot, deserve better. Here
goes.
Let's begin with the big number: 9300. It
conjures up lurid images of deans knee-deep
in high school transcripts, tidal waves of
manila envelopes surging through the
admissions office door, right?
Not so.
Hargadon cited the figure for last year's
freshman class — the class of 1976, which
was admitted in early 1972.
Luckily, the provost's office prepared an
extensive report on the admissions process
for just that year. 'The group of
approximately 9000 applicants," the report
noted, includes "incomplete applications."
How many complete applications were
there? 7617.
Does the admissions office consider
incomplete applications? No.
