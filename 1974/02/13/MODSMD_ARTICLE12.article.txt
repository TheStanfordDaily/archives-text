# Doctors Should Be Redistributed
## 
### 
Marie Anderson

In response to Bruce Smyth's opinion on
the state of American medical education
(Daily, Feb. 7), I would like to present my
opposing opinions as one who will enter
medical school in September.
Granted that all of Smyth's comments
regarding the reduction of medical schools by
the American Medical Association are true,
the allegation that this has created an
undersupply of physicians is naive and
deceiving. There is currently one doctor for
every seven-eight hundred U.S. residents.
This would be enough if they were equitably
distributed by specialty and locale.
Unfortunately they are not.
Some specialties are in excess while
others, including family practice and general
practice are lacking. Also, physicians are
disproportionately living in large coastal
urban centers. These trends in specialty and
M?ale are largely the result of money and
>stige being prime motivations for many to

enter medicine. Simply increasing the
number of doctors available would only
aggravate the maldistribution.
More Doctors Not Solution
Flooding the market with too many of the
wrong kind of doctors would solve nothing.
To expect the AMA to encourage particular
specialties and general practice is ignoring the
primary cause. Many medical schools don't
have faculty competent to teach general
practice and the unpopular specialties. This
isn't surprising because general practice has
never been particularly prestigious or
profitable, and the unpopular specialties
include such overworked physicians as
pediatricians and obstetricians.
Few doctors prefer practicing in isolated
small towns or even the lower class areas of
large cities. Physicians feel they earn the right
to live where they wish, but this frequently
ignores the places needing medical care the
most. Well over 100 state counties are lacking

any physician, yet no one has attempted to
determine where doctors live.
Redistribute Physicians
I believe the most effective answer to
these problems would be some form of
socialized medicine or strong incentives to
redistribute physicians. American physicians
earn more, compared to other professions,
than doctors in any other country. They are
not intrinsically worth more, they simply
have a stronger union, the AMA.
One incentive that is currently successful
in Mexico lets the government pay all of a
student's debts if the new doctor will
practice his first year in a small village. By
providing strong incentives to redistribute
physicians, and simultaneously controlling
their income to a more reasonable level,
many American health care problems could
be alleviated without useless and costly
expansion of medical school facilties.

In response to Bruce Smyth's opinion on
the state of American medical education
(Daily, Feb. 7), I would like to present my
opposing opinions as one who will enter
medical school in September.
Granted that all of Smyth's comments
regarding the reduction of medical schools by
the American Medical Association are true,
the allegation that this has created an
undersupply of physicians is naive and
deceiving. There is currently one doctor for
every seven-eight hundred U.S. residents.
This would be enough if they were equitably
distributed by specialty and locale.
Unfortunately they are not.
Some specialties are in excess while
others, including family practice and general
practice are lacking. Also, physicians are
disproportionately living in large coastal
urban centers. These trends in specialty and
M?ale are largely the result of money and
>stige being prime motivations for many to

enter medicine. Simply increasing the
number of doctors available would only
aggravate the maldistribution.
More Doctors Not Solution
Flooding the market with too many of the
wrong kind of doctors would solve nothing.
To expect the AMA to encourage particular
specialties and general practice is ignoring the
primary cause. Many medical schools don't
have faculty competent to teach general
practice and the unpopular specialties. This
isn't surprising because general practice has
never been particularly prestigious or
profitable, and the unpopular specialties
include such overworked physicians as
pediatricians and obstetricians.
Few doctors prefer practicing in isolated
small towns or even the lower class areas of
large cities. Physicians feel they earn the right
to live where they wish, but this frequently
ignores the places needing medical care the
most. Well over 100 state counties are lacking

any physician, yet no one has attempted to
determine where doctors live.
Redistribute Physicians
I believe the most effective answer to
these problems would be some form of
socialized medicine or strong incentives to
redistribute physicians. American physicians
earn more, compared to other professions,
than doctors in any other country. They are
not intrinsically worth more, they simply
have a stronger union, the AMA.
One incentive that is currently successful
in Mexico lets the government pay all of a
student's debts if the new doctor will
practice his first year in a small village. By
providing strong incentives to redistribute
physicians, and simultaneously controlling
their income to a more reasonable level,
many American health care problems could
be alleviated without useless and costly
expansion of medical school facilties.
