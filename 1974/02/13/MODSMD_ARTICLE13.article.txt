# Chilean Refugees Need Our Help
##

Charles Stephens

Although Chile has disappeared from the
North American press, there are still
saddening, almost daily, reports of repression
and hardship for the Chilean people. As the
military junta tightens its grip on political life
in Chile, economic hardships are lowering the
standard of living of the vast majority of
Chileans.
Lowering of the standard of living has
been the lot of workers who have maintained
their jobs. More alarming is the soaring
unemployment. Even censored newspapers
have reported 25 percent unemployment in
some trades, while the U.S. embassy's
estimate is 13 percent not including those
"suspended from their jobs for political
reasons." In factories and offices, 15 percent
and more workers have been fired for
political beliefs.
Amnesty International reports that the
torture of political prisoners, with the aid of
Brazilian "experts" has taken place on a large
scale in Chile since the September coup. The
New York Times of Jan. 13 reported the
arrests of six internationally known

physicians and orders for the arrest and
imprisonment of at least twenty others in
Santiago alone.
Junta Cracks Down
In Chile, even the pro-government press is
now feeling the heavy hand of the military
junta. Only pro-junta publications are
allowed to publish and on Jan. 14 censorship
was ordered against most of Santiago's
remaining newspapers, including the
conservative EI Mercurio chain. The only
paper not affected was the government organ
La Patria.
The junta is even cracking down on the
right-wing political parties that supported the
coup against Salvador Allende. Any change in
party officials must now be reported to the
Ministry of the Interior which is empowered
to reject the proposed names. The decree
warns that the parties must refrain from any
attempt to engage in political activity "in the
guise of the pursuit of cultural, sports,
humanitarian or other ends."
The right-wing parties were declared by
the junta to be in recess shortly after the

coup. All left parties and movements were
outlawed.
Refugees Seek Asylum
More than 3000 Chileans and foreigners
are now either in the four United Nations
havens in Santiago or in foreign embassies or
private homes waiting to leave Chile. Some
10,000 political prisoners are in jails and
concentration camps. An unknown number
of people still in Chile are being hunted by
the military: potential refugees, probably in
the thousands.
In order to leave with a safe-conduct pass,
refugees need an invitation from a country
willing to provide a visa. Many countries have
accepted Chilean refugees but the U.S. is
conspicuously not among them. Opening up
the borders to refugees rests in the hands of
the President and the State Department. We
urge you to write the Secretary of State,
Henry Kissinger, and ask that the U.S. give
asylum to these political refugees.

Lowering of the standard of living has
been the lot of workers who have maintained
their jobs. More alarming is the soaring
unemployment. Even censored newspapers
have reported 25 percent unemployment in
some trades, while the U.S. embassy's
estimate is 13 percent not including those
"suspended from their jobs for political
reasons." In factories and offices, 15 percent
and more workers have been fired for
political beliefs.
Amnesty International reports that the
torture of political prisoners, with the aid of
Brazilian "experts" has taken place on a large
scale in Chile since the September coup. The
New York Times of Jan. 13 reported the
arrests of six internationally known

physicians and orders for the arrest and
imprisonment of at least twenty others in
Santiago alone.
Junta Cracks Down
In Chile, even the pro-government press is
now feeling the heavy hand of the military
junta. Only pro-junta publications are
allowed to publish and on Jan. 14 censorship
was ordered against most of Santiago's
remaining newspapers, including the
conservative EI Mercurio chain. The only
paper not affected was the government organ
La Patria.
The junta is even cracking down on the
right-wing political parties that supported the
coup against Salvador Allende. Any change in
party officials must now be reported to the
Ministry of the Interior which is empowered
to reject the proposed names. The decree
warns that the parties must refrain from any
attempt to engage in political activity "in the
guise of the pursuit of cultural, sports,
humanitarian or other ends."
The right-wing parties were declared by
the junta to be in recess shortly after the

coup. All left parties and movements were
outlawed.
Refugees Seek Asylum
More than 3000 Chileans and foreigners
are now either in the four United Nations
havens in Santiago or in foreign embassies or
private homes waiting to leave Chile. Some
10,000 political prisoners are in jails and
concentration camps. An unknown number
of people still in Chile are being hunted by
the military: potential refugees, probably in
the thousands.
In order to leave with a safe-conduct pass,
refugees need an invitation from a country
willing to provide a visa. Many countries have
accepted Chilean refugees but the U.S. is
conspicuously not among them. Opening up
the borders to refugees rests in the hands of
the President and the State Department. We
urge you to write the Secretary of State,
Henry Kissinger, and ask that the U.S. give
asylum to these political refugees.

Although Chile has disappeared from the
North American press, there are still
saddening, almost daily, reports of repression
and hardship for the Chilean people. As the
military junta tightens its grip on political life
in Chile, economic hardships are lowering the
standard of living of the vast majority of
Chileans.
