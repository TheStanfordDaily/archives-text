Accidents And Eyesores
Editor:
One may freely predict a
serious accident on Campus Drive
as it swings around towards the
women's tennis courts. Cars come
hell-bent around that curb, where
visibility is very poor. They
seldom even try to stop at the
crosswalk. At least there ought to
be a caution sign.
A physically less urgent
problem, but one deeply
damaging to the quality of our
lives, is the strip of asphalt which
now blights what was once a
stretch of beautiful country lane,
Searsville Road. Apparently no
one with concern with the
appearance of the campus was
consulted before contractors were
called in to perpetrate this
gratuitous blasphemy. All they
really needed to do was fill a few
potholes.
Or in any event why can't
there be a committee of people
with some visual sense to watch
over this sort of thing? Will those
who feel as indignant as I do,
please drop me a line?

Suicide: Another View
Editor:
Since Mark Weaver's essay on
suicide was apparently written
primarily from personal
experience, I feel free to
contradict him from the same
basis. Although personal isolation
and suicide are often found
together, it is a fallacy to assume
one causes the other. Persons
commit suicide for a variety of
reasons, but in general from the
conviction that life is not worth
living.
A severely isolated person who
cannot maintain a loving
relationship might reach this
conclusion; on the other hand, a
mystic striving for communion
with God would welcome this
isolation. However, a man who
has determined that his life has no
purpose nor holds any possibility
of pleasure would be unlikely to
agree that "communication holds
the possibility of redemption."
Communication and interpersonal
relations, by themselves, are
insufficient to give life meaning.
I would also deny that "suicide
is at once the most courageous
and cowardly of acts." I doubt
that man's most terrible fear is of
isolation, and most people would
agree that there are "fates worse
than death." If one disregards
suicide attempts that are solely
pleas for help, one would observe
that suicide is simply an escape.
Those who commit suicide
deserve neither our pity nor
contempt; until one can discover a
convincing reason for continuing
to live, suicide must be seen only
as an alternate route.

When I attempted to vote on
the Row referendum on Feb. 6 I
was given a ballot which read as
follows:
"Shall the ASSU
support/oppose the University
planned construction of a
100-unit faculty/emeriti housing
project on the Row at the site of
the Old Stanford Elementary
School?"
(Circle one) Accept Reject
By circling either "Accept" or
"Reject," I could accept the
ASSU support, oppose the ASSU
support, reject the ASSU support,
or reject the ASSU opposition.
Several other voters at the poll
verbalized their similar confusion.
Later in the day I was
informed that a second, less
ambiguous ballot had been supplied
to the polling places.
I have three questions:
1) Who authorized the wording
of the first, ambiguous ballot?
2) As a point of constitutional
legality, is a referendum valid if
two different forms of ballots are
utilized?
3) If the referendum was not
valid, how would the tabulation
and subsequent publicizing of
results be justified?

I wish to clarify a statement
attributed to me in the Feb. 11

team's recent trip to Humboldt
may not have been a victorious
one, but it certainly was not "a

this is not only beneficial to a

Suicide: Another View
Editor:
Since Mark Weaver's essay on
suicide was apparently written
primarily from personal
experience, I feel free to
contradict him from the same
basis. Although personal isolation
and suicide are often found
together, it is a fallacy to assume
one causes the other. Persons
commit suicide for a variety of
reasons, but in general from the
conviction that life is not worth
living.
A severely isolated person who
cannot maintain a loving
relationship might reach this
conclusion; on the other hand, a
mystic striving for communion
with God would welcome this
isolation. However, a man who
has determined that his life has no
purpose nor holds any possibility
of pleasure would be unlikely to
agree that "communication holds
the possibility of redemption."
Communication and interpersonal
relations, by themselves, are
insufficient to give life meaning.
I would also deny that "suicide
is at once the most courageous
and cowardly of acts." I doubt
that man's most terrible fear is of
isolation, and most people would
agree that there are "fates worse
than death." If one disregards
suicide attempts that are solely
pleas for help, one would observe
that suicide is simply an escape.
Those who commit suicide
deserve neither our pity nor
contempt; until one can discover a
convincing reason for continuing
to live, suicide must be seen only
as an alternate route.

When I attempted to vote on
the Row referendum on Feb. 6 I
was given a ballot which read as
follows:
"Shall the ASSU
support/oppose the University
planned construction of a
100-unit faculty/emeriti housing
project on the Row at the site of
the Old Stanford Elementary
School?"
(Circle one) Accept Reject
By circling either "Accept" or
"Reject," I could accept the
ASSU support, oppose the ASSU
support, reject the ASSU support,
or reject the ASSU opposition.
Several other voters at the poll
verbalized their similar confusion.
Later in the day I was
informed that a second, less
ambiguous ballot had been supplied
to the polling places.
I have three questions:
1) Who authorized the wording
of the first, ambiguous ballot?
2) As a point of constitutional
legality, is a referendum valid if
two different forms of ballots are
utilized?
3) If the referendum was not
valid, how would the tabulation
and subsequent publicizing of
