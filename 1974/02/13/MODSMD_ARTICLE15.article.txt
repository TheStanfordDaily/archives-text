# Controversy Rages Over Vitamin Use
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
The manager of a local health
food store takes 50,000 units of
vitamin A every day. A professor
takes 6,000 m.g. of vitamin C to
prevent colds. A freshman takes
400 units of vitamin E to enhance
his virility.
Most nutritionists think these
dietary supplements are
unnecessary, saying that an
adequate diet supplies all the
nutrients a normal person needs.
Now, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) warns that
massive doses of vitamins taken
over a prolonged period may be
hazardous to health.
Controversy over the FDA's
position began last year when the
agency announced recommended
daily allowances (RDA) of
common vitamins and minerals,
based on a ten year study of
nutrition needs.
The allowances are
considerably lower than doses
recommended by health writers
such as nutritionist Adelle Davis,
author of the best-selling Let's Eat
Right To Keep Fit , and Nobel
Prize-winning Chemistry Prof.

Linus Pauling, author of Vitamin
C and the Common Cold.
Required Prescription
Since Oct. 1. the FDA has
required a doctor's prescription
for purchase of vitamins A and D
in high concentrations. Doctors
warn that unlike the other
vitamins , A and D can build up in
the body and cause side-effects
such as bone fragility (A), and
kidney damage (D).
Effective Jan. 1, 1975 vitamins
C, E, and the B complex vitamins
in concentrations over 150
percent of the EDA will be
labeled as drugs, though they will
still be available without
prescription.
Announcement of the
regulations has sparked massive
protest. More than a dozen suits
have been filed against the agency.
These have been combined and
are expected to reach the courts
by October, probably in San
Francisco. However, Pauling is
trying to separate his suit from
the others, since he is only suing
on behalf of vitamin C.
Health food retailers and
vitamin manufacturers are furious
at the FDA. Health is big business.
Americans swallowed $300
million of vitamins last year,
including 30 million pounds of
vitamin C. Mid-peninsulans
patronize a dozen health food
stores and dietary supplement

distributors.
Shelves at the Tresidder store
hold bottles of vitamin C in
concentrations ranging from
1,000 m.g. down to 100 m.g. — all
considered too potent by the
FDA. The store also sells vitamin
E in 100-400 unit doses. The
RDA is 45 units.
Civil Liberties Issue
Consumer groups have raised a
civil liberties issue: they don't
want Big Brother telling them
what to eat. Consumers for Health
Freedom organized under the
slogan, "Go To Health, FDA."
The group sponsored a rally last
November in the Cow Palace to
gather support for the Hosmer
Bill, a House Bill which would
prevent the FDA from regulating
dietary supplements unless "such
article is intrinsically injurious to
health in the recommended
dosage."
'The federal FDA theory is
pure poppycock and contrary to
sound scientific findings," says
chairman Russell V. Lombardo,
who accuses the agency of scare
tactics.
Rep. Paul McCloskey,
R-Menlo Park, calls the Hosmer
bill "too broad,'' but adds, "I
don't know any member of
Congress who has the background
to decide the merits of this issue."
Currently the Hosmer bill is
stalemated in Congress.
Health Food Claims
Most doctors, scientists, and
nutritionists are dubious about
the claims of health food
advocates. "Adelle Davis says that
everybody in America is
undernourished," notes Alice
Hine, clinical nutritionist at the
Medical School. "It's true that
people spend money foolishly on
foods, but I disagree with her that
it's impossible to supply nutrient
needs from a supermarket. We'd
like to teach people to spend their

money wisely."
An example of consumer
confusion is vitamin E, which has
been called "a vitamin in search of
a disease." Vitamin E is
commonly claimed to increase
sexual potency, fight body odor,
and prevent heart attacks.
According to various sources, it
can also soothe aching feet, avert
miscarriage, end constipation,
prevent cirrhosis of the liver,
stabilize blood pressure,
strengthen muscles, reverse mental
retardation, improve vision, heal
wounds, slow aging, smooth
wrinkles, and alleviate arthritis.
Nutritionists say vitamin E is
an anti-oxidant which prevents
fats from going rancid in the
tissue.
"There are a lot of myths going
around based on ignorance," says
Pediatrics Prof. Nicholas
Hoogenraad, who will teach a
human biology course on human
nutrition in the spring. He feels
the FDA is properly cautious and
supports the policy "certainly
until it's shown there's really no
side effects of these mega-vitamin
types of diets. There's sufficient
alarm that it warrants checking."
Hoogenraad agrees with health
food boosters that food
processing can remove some
vitamins, but adds, "Despite this,
there's little evidence of any
vitamin deficiency in the
American diet."
The powerful American
Medical Association backs the
FDA's policy. Philip White,
director of the AMA's
Department of Foods and
Nutrition, observes that the
side-effects of high doses of
vitamins C, E, and the B complex
vitamins are unknown and may
prove dangerous.
White warns that a
mega-vitamin diet "eventually can
create an unnatural adaptation, a

drug dependence, if you will:
cessation of the regiment then
results in a withdrawal situation —
a self-induced deficiency. We
know this can happen with
massive doses of vitamin C. We
strongly suspect it can occur with
the B complex vitamins as well."
Self Inflicted Deficiency
Nutritionist Hine adds that
since vitamins work together, a
person can create a deficiency by
taking too much of one vitamin
without corresponding amounts
of other vitamins.
Vitamin supporters minimize
these dangers. Warren P. Fuller,
manager of Nutrilite Food
Supplement Distributors in Menlo
Park, has taken 50,000 units of
vitamin A for the last 28 years,
ten times the RDA. He takes a
proportional amound of vitamin
D. "The likelihood of a person
consuming too much is very slim,
practically nil," Fuller claims.

He thinks the government
should let the consumer decide
nutrition issues for himself. "It's
okay to have a RDA. There's only
one thing wrong and that's to say
that it's the maximum you can
purchase. Any person can read the
various authorities and make his
own decision."
Pauling also opposes regulation
of vitamin A, denying that excess
amounts can cause serious health
problems. "No people have ever
died from an overdose of vitamin
A. Thousands have died from an
overdose of aspirin. You can take
too much of anything."
Although Pauling admits that
too much vitamin C can cause
diarrhea, he dismisses a
connection with kidney stones as
"vague talk." He says, "Tens of
thousands of people have taken
large doses of vitamin C without
any harmful effect. Of course it's
known to be beneficial."

Pauling feels his theory that
high doses of vitamin C
counteract the common cold is
being vindicated by research. He
cites a recent study conducted by
the U.S. Public Health Service at
an Arizona boarding school.
Of 640 children involved, those
taking 1,000 to 2,000 m.g. of
vitamin C per day averaged 30
percent fewer days of illness from
colds than those taking a placebo.
Doctors reported that the vitamin
did not cut down significantly on
the number of colds, but did
alleviate some of the symptoms.
Pauling's theories have been
influential. Many Americans agree
with the nice lady in the Geritol
commercial: "When you've got
your health, you've got just about
everything." Consumers bought
30 million pounds of vitamin C
last year in search of health. But
debate continues on whether
vitamin supplements are a health
hazard or a health necessity.
