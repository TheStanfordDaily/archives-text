# Local Mass Transportation Analyzed
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The problems and future of
mass transportation in the Bay
Area was the subject Monday of a
meeting of Peninsula politicians
and transit experts.
"I guess everyone wants public
transportation, but no one wants
to pay for it," claimed Jack
Beckett, chairman of the
Metropolitan Transportation
Commission.
"Something like seven-tenths
of a percent of all traffic in Santa
Clara County goes by public
transportation. We have, as a goal,
30 percent of all trips being made

by public transportation,"
Beckett stated.
The new emphasis on mass
transit results from anti-pollution
laws and the energy crisis. Russell
Freeman of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)
explained why the Agency is
committed to a reduction in
private automobile traffic.
Transportation Control
"We were required | by law | to
promulgate transportation control
plans for five cities in California,
including San Francisco [and the
Bay Area |. The EPA may use
transportation and land use

controls to bring air pollution
levels into line," Freeman noted.
To reach the goal of 30 percent
of traffic volume going by mass
transit , Santa Clara County
plans to use a fleet of 200 buses,
according to Jim Pott, public
works director for the county.
"We are now running 61 buses.
We have 134 buses under
construction. We have four buses
for wheelchair-handicapped
awaiting approval from the federal
government. We have two electric
shuttle-buses also awaiting
approval.
"A four-fold increase from
where we started is a considerable
increase," Pott concluded.
'Dial-a-Ride'
Pott hopes that 97 percent of
county residents will be able to
use the new bus system. Half of
the buses will go on regular
routes, while the rest will be on a
"Dial-a-Ride" system.
"The so-called Dial-a-Ride
system includes subscription 'bus
pools,' which are just oversized
car pools. The buses will be sent
out in 15 or 30-minute
[intervals]," Pott stated.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R—Menlo Park) noted that no
representative from the Federal
Energy Office was present. He
spoke of local transit problems
with respect to the energy crisis.
"The local governments now

have to meet with each other .. .
[and| superimposed on all this is
the energy crisis.
"If we are to conserve energy,
it means the study of our life-style
. . . whether we can afford to live
20, 30, or 40 miles away from our
jobs," McCloskey observed.
Mayor Kirke Comstock of the
City of Palo Alto and Pres. Gene
Tolomei of the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce
represented the sponsoring
organizations at the meeting.

representative from the Federal

spoke of local transit problems
with respect to the energy crisis.
"The local governments now

have to meet with each other .. .
[and| superimposed on all this is
the energy crisis.
"If we are to conserve energy,
it means the study of our life-style

jobs," McCloskey observed.

DISCUSSING BUSING—PaIo Alto Mayor Kirke Comstock, left, and
Rep. Pete McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, discuss the future of local mass
transit.
The problems and future of
mass transportation in the Bay
Area was the subject Monday of a
meeting of Peninsula politicians
and transit experts.
"I guess everyone wants public
transportation, but no one wants
to pay for it," claimed Jack
Beckett, chairman of the
Metropolitan Transportation
Commission.
"Something like seven-tenths
of a percent of all traffic in Santa
Clara County goes by public
transportation. We have, as a goal,
30 percent of all trips being made

by public transportation,"
Beckett stated.
The new emphasis on mass
transit results from anti-pollution
laws and the energy crisis. Russell
Freeman of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)
explained why the Agency is
committed to a reduction in
private automobile traffic.
Transportation Control
"We were required | by law | to
promulgate transportation control
plans for five cities in California,
including San Francisco [and the
Bay Area |. The EPA may use
transportation and land use

controls to bring air pollution
levels into line," Freeman noted.
To reach the goal of 30 percent
of traffic volume going by mass
transit , Santa Clara County
plans to use a fleet of 200 buses,
according to Jim Pott, public
works director for the county.
"We are now running 61 buses.
We have 134 buses under
construction. We have four buses
for wheelchair-handicapped
awaiting approval from the federal
government. We have two electric
shuttle-buses also awaiting
approval.
"A four-fold increase from
where we started is a considerable
increase," Pott concluded.
'Dial-a-Ride'
Pott hopes that 97 percent of
county residents will be able to
use the new bus system. Half of
the buses will go on regular
routes, while the rest will be on a
"Dial-a-Ride" system.
"The so-called Dial-a-Ride
system includes subscription 'bus
pools,' which are just oversized
car pools. The buses will be sent
out in 15 or 30-minute
[intervals]," Pott stated.
