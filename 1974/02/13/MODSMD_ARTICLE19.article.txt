# Subtleties Lost In Canadian Opera's 'Cosi Fan Tutti'
## 
### KIP CRANNA 
CUPERTINO — Italian opera
sung in English solves countless
problems for American audiences
while creating new ones for the
performers, as was amply
demonstrated at the Flint Center
Saturday night in the Canadian
Opera Company's production of
Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutti, loosely
translated as Women Are Like
That.
Though the opera's farcical
plot employs some of the
standard comic devices of opera
buffa — outrageous disguises,
scheming servants, dallying lovers
— Mozart's masterful musical
setting, given the proper dramatic

realization, includes moments of
brilliant characterization and
superb psychological perception.
A temptation for English-speaking
artists is to overlook all this and
emphasize burlesque elements
which are so much more
accessible to audience
appreciation than when delivered
in an unfamiliar language. It is a
temptation this young Canadian
company found hard to resist.
Set in eighteenth-century
Naples, the opera deals with the
inconstancies of two flirtacious
sisters, Dorabella and Fiordiligi,
whose respective fiances put their
fidelity to the test in a wager with
the cynical bachelor Don Alfonso,

who holds that no woman remains
faithful to her lover. The two
suitors, disguised as exotic
Albanian visitors, attempt to woo
each other's sweetheart.
Numerous complications ensue,
giving rise to some hilarious
encounters and much fine music.
Kathleen Ruddell sang the role
of the emotional Dorabella with
charm and vivacity, though her
dark mezzo-soprano voice lacked
some of the agility needed for her
dramatic first act aria. Jeannette
Dagger as Fiordiligi displayed a
voice of wide and flexible range —
with a touch of throatiness in the
lower register — in the brilliant
and difficult passagework of her

aria Come scoglio. Regrettably,
her declamation, though distinct,
bore traces of a flat North
American twang more typical of a
Nebraska housewife than a
Neapolitan debutante.
While Ronald Bermingham's
attractive bass-baritone voice did
him credit in the part of
Guglielmo, John Arab's expansive
but husky vocal quality was a
disappointment in his portrayl of
Ferrando. His well-known aria Un
aura amorosa, which requires a
delicate balance of classic elegance
and lyric expression, received
instead a forced, exuberant
rendering which almost seemed to
catalog the bad habits of gushy

Italian tenors.
Baritone Jan Rubes was
excellent as the aging Alfonso,
smoothly interpreting his
character more as the congenial
sophisticate than the cynical roue.
But the evening's most gratifying
vocal effort was easily that of Ann
Cooper, who combined sparkle
and wit with a bright, clear
soprano timbre in her amusing
performance as the conniving,
disguise-donning maid, Despina.
The company's small but able
orchestra, directed by Stanford
graduate Errol Gay, was
professional in every respect,
playing with crisp articulation and
a fine stylistic sense.
Perhaps more than any
other Mozart opera, Cosi abounus
in delightful vocal ensembles, and
it was in these that the singers

were at their best. But it was here
also that their extra-musical
clowning reached almost slapstick
proportions. Director Herman
Geiger-Torel had the singers
endlessly prancing and
criss-crossing the stage, mugging
and side-glancing in ways that
were sometimes funny, but often
simply distracting. A lively and
enjoyable production it was, but
what a pity that amidst all that
comic bluster and melodramatic
posturing there was no room for
the subtler characterization and
more sublime dramatic insights of
Mozart's creative genius.

CUPERTINO — Italian opera
sung in English solves countless
problems for American audiences
while creating new ones for the
performers, as was amply
demonstrated at the Flint Center
Saturday night in the Canadian
Opera Company's production of
Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutti, loosely
translated as Women Are Like
That.
Though the opera's farcical
plot employs some of the
standard comic devices of opera
buffa — outrageous disguises,
scheming servants, dallying lovers
— Mozart's masterful musical
setting, given the proper dramatic

realization, includes moments of
brilliant characterization and
superb psychological perception.
A temptation for English-speaking
artists is to overlook all this and
emphasize burlesque elements
which are so much more
accessible to audience
appreciation than when delivered
in an unfamiliar language. It is a
temptation this young Canadian
company found hard to resist.
Set in eighteenth-century
Naples, the opera deals with the
inconstancies of two flirtacious
sisters, Dorabella and Fiordiligi,
whose respective fiances put their
fidelity to the test in a wager with
the cynical bachelor Don Alfonso,

who holds that no woman remains
faithful to her lover. The two
suitors, disguised as exotic
Albanian visitors, attempt to woo
each other's sweetheart.
Numerous complications ensue,
giving rise to some hilarious
encounters and much fine music.
Kathleen Ruddell sang the role
of the emotional Dorabella with
charm and vivacity, though her
dark mezzo-soprano voice lacked
some of the agility needed for her
dramatic first act aria. Jeannette
Dagger as Fiordiligi displayed a
voice of wide and flexible range —
with a touch of throatiness in the
lower register — in the brilliant
and difficult passagework of her

aria Come scoglio. Regrettably,
her declamation, though distinct,
bore traces of a flat North
American twang more typical of a
Nebraska housewife than a
Neapolitan debutante.
While Ronald Bermingham's
attractive bass-baritone voice did
him credit in the part of
Guglielmo, John Arab's expansive
but husky vocal quality was a
disappointment in his portrayl of
Ferrando. His well-known aria Un
aura amorosa, which requires a
delicate balance of classic elegance
and lyric expression, received
instead a forced, exuberant
rendering which almost seemed to
catalog the bad habits of gushy

Italian tenors.
Baritone Jan Rubes was
excellent as the aging Alfonso,
smoothly interpreting his
character more as the congenial
sophisticate than the cynical roue.
But the evening's most gratifying
vocal effort was easily that of Ann
Cooper, who combined sparkle
and wit with a bright, clear
soprano timbre in her amusing
performance as the conniving,
disguise-donning maid, Despina.
The company's small but able
orchestra, directed by Stanford
graduate Errol Gay, was
professional in every respect,
playing with crisp articulation and
a fine stylistic sense.
Perhaps more than any
other Mozart opera, Cosi abounus
in delightful vocal ensembles, and
it was in these that the singers

were at their best. But it was here
also that their extra-musical
clowning reached almost slapstick
proportions. Director Herman
Geiger-Torel had the singers
endlessly prancing and
criss-crossing the stage, mugging
and side-glancing in ways that
were sometimes funny, but often
simply distracting. A lively and
enjoyable production it was, but
what a pity that amidst all that
comic bluster and melodramatic
posturing there was no room for
the subtler characterization and
more sublime dramatic insights of
