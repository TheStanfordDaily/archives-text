# Frats Swap Houses To Survive
## 
### SANDY WHITE First of Three Parts 
"The true fraternity exists for friendship and loyalty,
neither of which is undemocratic or expensive,"
University Vice President John C. Branner said in a
speech to new students on September 6, 1905. But since
1891, when the first eight formed local chapters,
Stanford fraternities have been attacked as being both
undemocratic and extravagant.
Yet 18 frats have survived, in one form or another,
crises of typhoid, fires, charges of bigotry, suspension
from the University, suspension form the national
fraternity, and the activism of the '60s.
Some are now coed, some have split with their
national organizations some have entered the housing
draw, and most have changed location at least once. But
they retain Greek names and maintain alumni ties. Some
still speak of ideals of friendship and loyalty, which
Branner advocated.
By the 1940'5, 24 national fraternities owned houses
on campus. Until they were abolished in 1944, there
were nine sororities along the various rows. The number
of frats remained constant until the early '60s, when

financial difficulties and growing disillusionment killed
six and changed many others.
A look at the history of three of the original frats will
illustrate the evolution of today's situation. One is still
active, another kept its name, but is no longer a
fraternity, and the third is defunct.
First Fraternity House
Phi Delta Theta's house, originally located next door
to Storey House, was the first fraternity house on
campus. Ernest D. Lewis, a member of the first group of
12 Phi Delts in 1891, called them "earnest,
conscientious students and thorough gentlemen." He
described the desire of campus fraternities "to exalt the
idea of the brotherhood of all men striving for a higher
education and a broader culture." The Phi Delts held a
reception for all students on May 28, 1892. It was a
major social event of the year, and established Phi Delta
Theta as one of the strongest, most active fraternities.
Active the Phi Delts have remained. They were fined
$150 in 1947 for hosing passing cars and pedestrians,
hanging on the front doors of women's residences,
brandishing and throwing bottles, and using obscene

language and performing unbecoming actions in view of
women in the residences. In 1962, they moved into Cluster
I, and their old house was torn down. In 1966, they
hijacked 11,000 Dailies, and were later suspended for
"misconduct" at a party they gave for girls from Mills
College. They received their latest touch of notoriety last
spring by raffling off a stripper at a party.
Alpha Tau Omega organized in Stanford's first year, but
did not move into their own house on Mayfield Row until
1912. In 1961, they were ousted from the national
fraternity when they pledged four Jewish students. They
chose to go local, and called themselves ATO fraternity. In
1968, they moved into Cluster 111, and the University took
over their old house, calling it Mayfield House. The Dekes,
whose house across Lasuen from Stillman was torn down,
moved into the old ATO house, and live there now.
Enthusiastic Athletes
Phi Gamma Delta, has lost not only its function as a
fraternity, but also its name. Like the other two, it
organized 1891-92, and established its first house in 1915.
Like the Phi Delts, the Fijis were enthusiastic athletes. In
May, 1948, they were fined $100 for having an off-campus
party without ASSU permission and with insufficient
chaperoning.
In the summer of 1962 their first house, on Mayfield

Avenue below Theta Xi and across from Durand, burned to
the ground. They moved into the Kappa Sigma house,
beeause the Kappa Sigs were moving into Cluster I. In
1968, the Fijis moved into Cluster 111, since their second
house was also burned.
They quit the national Phi Gamma Delta organization in
1970 after financial troubles and failure to pay national
dues. They also felt that the national rules were irrelevant.
Their house was taken over by the University, and is now
coed, independent ZAP House.
' House-Hopscotch'
The University has played house-hopscotch with the
whole Row. During World War 11, freshmen males moved
out of Encina to make room for the Army. The fraternities
took the names of U.S. presidents and housed the
freshmen, according to their major subjects. That period
was the only time when everyone but Betas lived in the
Beta house. But other houses have not been so stable.
As a fraternity dies or packs off to a cluster, its house is
torn down, moved, or turned into University housing.
Kairos is the old Delta Chi house, the Zeta Psi house is the
Bechtel International Center, and the SAE house was
located next to the present site of White Plaza. Synergy is
in the old Beta Chi house, which was Sigma Nu before that.
Jordan, Durand, Storey, Guthrie, Lathrop, Roth, Hurlburt,
and Stillman used to be sorority houses.
