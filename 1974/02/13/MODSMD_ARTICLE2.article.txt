# Frats Swap Houses To Survive
## 
### SANDY WHITE First of Three Parts 
"The true fraternity exists for friendship and loyalty,
neither of which is undemocratic or expensive,"
University Vice President John C. Branner said in a
speech to new students on September 6, 1905. But since
1891, when the first eight formed local chapters,
Stanford fraternities have been attacked as being both
undemocratic and extravagant.
Yet 18 frats have survived, in one form or another,
crises of typhoid, fires, charges of bigotry, suspension
from the University, suspension form the national
fraternity, and the activism of the '60s.
Some are now coed, some have split with their
national organizations some have entered the housing
draw, and most have changed location at least once. But
they retain Greek names and maintain alumni ties. Some
still speak of ideals of friendship and loyalty, which
Branner advocated.
By the 1940'5, 24 national fraternities owned houses
on campus. Until they were abolished in 1944, there
were nine sororities along the various rows. The number
of frats remained constant until the early '60s, when

financial difficulties and growing disillusionment killed
six and changed many others.
A look at the history of three of the original frats will
illustrate the evolution of today's situation. One is still
active, another kept its name, but is no longer a
fraternity, and the third is defunct.
First Fraternity House
Phi Delta Theta's house, originally located next door
to Storey House, was the first fraternity house on
campus. Ernest D. Lewis, a member of the first group of
12 Phi Delts in 1891, called them "earnest,
conscientious students and thorough gentlemen." He
described the desire of campus fraternities "to exalt the
idea of the brotherhood of all men striving for a higher
education and a broader culture." The Phi Delts held a
reception for all students on May 28, 1892. It was a
major social event of the year, and established Phi Delta
Theta as one of the strongest, most active fraternities.
Active the Phi Delts have remained. They were fined
$150 in 1947 for hosing passing cars and pedestrians,
hanging on the front doors of women's residences,
brandishing and throwing bottles, and using obscene


RETA BASTION — The Beta Theta Pi House, which presides majestically over the corner of Campus Drive and
Lasuen St., holds one of the few fraternities which has not relocated in recent years.
