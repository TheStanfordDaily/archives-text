# At Great American Hall
## Journey, Schon Soar 
### WILLIAM BURKE 
SAN FRANCISCO - The
Great American Music Hall put on
a very interesting show Saturday
night, presenting Sapo before
Journey; interesting because Sapo
is an offshoot of Malo and
Journey grew out of Santana
when Carlos Santana joined with
Mahavishnu John McLaughlin.
Interesting because Sapo is based
on percussion and Journey is
based on rhythm.
Sapo, my friend tells me,
means Toad. They played well
within the apparently limited
range of Latino music; percussion
is their theme, not their basis.
Guitar and organ (the organist
plays very well, when he is
allowed some time) serve only to
connect the percussion elements,
denied instrumental standing by a
drumming repetitiveness that is
eventually painful.
The bassist has mastered no
more than a four note progression
and the horn section (featuring a
fine sax player who, of course,
gets nowhere near the time he
deserves) is used as yet another
percussive input, with little
melodic freedom. The sound is
not carefully layered, but rather
stacked on itself, vocals lost in the
loudness.
'Nobody's Perfect'
Twice Sapo started excellent
jamming possibilities and pulled
out early. In "Get It On" they
opened up a little bit and gave the
sax man 30 seconds â€” half a

minute of the best music of their
set. They were flying, but
immediately switched back into
the monotony of their
tintinabula. Their encore was, by
Fate's sweet hand, "Nobody's
Perfect." They have a long road
ahead of them.
A good deal further down that
road is Journey, and one may
wish to follow their eminent rise,
for they are accomplished
musicians. They have been
together less than a month, and
thus had a somewhat limited
repertoire Saturday night, but it
seems inevitable that they will
burst into a wider range of
melodies.
His Own Style
Neal Schon is an accomplished
hard-rock guitarist with his own
style of high, piercing notes.
Ansiey Dunbar is a superb
drummer, bassist Ross Valory
plays a ripping bassline, and the
whole group produces a driving,
gripping energy.
Journey's first number was
perhaps the best of the evening, a
powerful rock 'n'roller. There is a
great deal of basis for the claim
that they sound like the old
Santana minus the heavy
percussion, but they produce their
own solid, jolting music. They
possess a clean sound, relaxed and
poised, with a true authority to
what they put down.
Vaiory's ripping bass
intensified an old Beatle tune,
"It's All Too Much" and then

they slid into a fine double lead
song, "Topaz," that was as close
as they came to a blues number
all night long. "Kohoutek" was a
springboard for Schon, who
moved into a very Beck-like lead.
Indeed, the manner of Journey is
to set up a solidly pounding
platform over which Schon's
guitar soars, like a bird over the
ocean. He sustains a high melody
searing through the framework of
the other musicians.
Journey rocks awesomely, like
the old Santana, setting a small
hall like The Great American afire
with the ferocity of their force.
One shortcoming of their music is
that it is too uniform, but this
may well be a reflection of their
short time together and easily
rectified.
They finished with more of the
heavy rock, at times sounding like
the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Schon
soaring over that familiar
framework; one might say they
are as close to the M.O. as they
are to Santana in sound. The
vocals were lost all night in the
volume, but Rollie wasn't singing
that well anyway.
Journey encored and went into
a surprisingly listless drum solo by
Dunbar, whose play the entire sot.
had been superb.
The group came together
perfectly at the end of it and blew
the ornate roof off the house.
Both Journey and The Great
American Music Hall are well
worth the time.
