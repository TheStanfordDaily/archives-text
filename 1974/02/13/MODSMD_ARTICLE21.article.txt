# Sailors Get Prestigious Invitation
## 
### 
The question: What well
known Stanford athletic team has
recently received an invitation to
one of the year's prestigious
college athletic events. The
answer: The Stanford sailing team
has received an invitation to the
1974 Kennedy Memorial Regatta.
Prestigious, you ask? The
Kennedy Cup is the cat's meow of
college sailing. It is held each
April at Annapolis in the Naval
Academy's Annapolis 44s
(44-foot yawls). It is considered
the true test of team strength
because it requires a well
coordinated and talented crew of
eight to sail the boat and win.
Well known, you ask? Believe
it or not, the Stanford sailing
team has been one of the
dominant teams in collegiate
sailing and in some circles is as
well known as the football team.
Stanford is the only team to have
won the Kennedy Cup more than
once. Stanford put together back
to back wins in 1967 and '68. The
Card sailors aren't the Bruins of
basketball or the Hoosiers of
swimming, but they're not bad
either.
The team that will try to bring
an unprecedented third Kennedy
Cup to Stanford will consist of
eight of the following sailors:
Craig Daniels, Ben Fisher, Skip
Shapiro, Alan Andrews, Brad
Mills, Tom Winokur, Paul Kolyn,
Paul Sobotka, Peter Skinner and
Lawson Fisher. The final crew will
be determined during practices
over the next month-and-a-half.
The practice necessary to mold
the team into a unit will take
place on the San Francisco Bay
until spring break. During the
break the team will travel to San
Diego to practice on an Annapolis
44 owned by the Coast Guard.
The next week the team will fly
to Annapolis.
On a more mundane level,
Stanford has continued to
compete in Northern California
Intercollegiate (NCIYRA) regattas
with mixed success. In the first
regatta of the quarter the team
finished fifth in a boat that was
continually filling with water as a
result of a miniature geyser that
developed at the back of the
centerboard. The bright spot of
the regatta was the performance
of Walt Spevak, who finished first
in the singlehanded division.
Last week the team finished
second in a regatta at Berkeley.
Skip Shapiro won his division
with race standings of 1-1-3. Craig
Daniels had a 2-3-4 series in the
other division. The highest
finisher in the singlehanded
division was Duncan Witte, who
olaced fourth.

Craig Daniels, Ben Fisher, Skip
Shapiro, Alan Andrews, Brad
Mills, Tom Winokur, Paul Kolyn,
Paul Sobotka, Peter Skinner and
Lawson Fisher. The final crew will
be determined during practices
over the next month-and-a-half.
The practice necessary to mold
the team into a unit will take
place on the San Francisco Bay
until spring break. During the
break the team will travel to San
Diego to practice on an Annapolis
44 owned by the Coast Guard.
The next week the team will fly
to Annapolis.
On a more mundane level,
Stanford has continued to
compete in Northern California
Intercollegiate (NCIYRA) regattas
with mixed success. In the first
regatta of the quarter the team
finished fifth in a boat that was
continually filling with water as a
result of a miniature geyser that
developed at the back of the
centerboard. The bright spot of
the regatta was the performance
of Walt Spevak, who finished first
in the singlehanded division.
Last week the team finished
second in a regatta at Berkeley.
Skip Shapiro won his division
with race standings of 1-1-3. Craig
Daniels had a 2-3-4 series in the
other division. The highest
finisher in the singlehanded
division was Duncan Witte, who
olaced fourth.
The question: What well
known Stanford athletic team has
recently received an invitation to
one of the year's prestigious
college athletic events. The
answer: The Stanford sailing team
has received an invitation to the
1974 Kennedy Memorial Regatta.
Prestigious, you ask? The
Kennedy Cup is the cat's meow of
college sailing. It is held each
April at Annapolis in the Naval
Academy's Annapolis 44s
(44-foot yawls). It is considered
the true test of team strength
because it requires a well
coordinated and talented crew of
eight to sail the boat and win.
Well known, you ask? Believe
it or not, the Stanford sailing
team has been one of the
dominant teams in collegiate
sailing and in some circles is as
well known as the football team.
Stanford is the only team to have
won the Kennedy Cup more than
once. Stanford put together back
to back wins in 1967 and '68. The
Card sailors aren't the Bruins of
basketball or the Hoosiers of
swimming, but they're not bad
either.
The team that will try to bring
an unprecedented third Kennedy
Cup to Stanford will consist of
eight of the following sailors:
Craig Daniels, Ben Fisher, Skip
Shapiro, Alan Andrews, Brad
Mills, Tom Winokur, Paul Kolyn,
Paul Sobotka, Peter Skinner and
Lawson Fisher. The final crew will
be determined during practices
