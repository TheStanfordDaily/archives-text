The above picturc of Terry Brown was one of 10 photos used
by sports information director Bob Murphy in a retaliatory
attack against Andy Sidaris of ABC-TV. Sidaris, who is
responsible for "honey shots" (quick camera glimpses of girls
in the stands) on ABC's football telecasts, charged in the
current issue of Sports Illustrated that "Stanford is no place
for honey shots. All we found there were girls dressed in a
style I can only describe as Early War of 1812. Is there a
shortage of hairbrushes at Stanford?" Murphy, who toured the
baseball, rugby and swimming events Saturday in search of
beautiful spectators, hopes the pictures Sidaris receives in the
mail this week will change his mind.
