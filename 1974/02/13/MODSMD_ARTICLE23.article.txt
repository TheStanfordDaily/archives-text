# Cards Continue Hockey Comeback
## 
### QUIGLEY S. PETERSON 
Stanford's ice hockey team
won its fourth straight game
Monday night, outscoring the
California Golden Bears 10-8 at
Legg's Arena in San Francisco.
This contest was the Cards' third
in four days. Still, they showed
little sign of fatigue, even in the
aftermath of last weekend's road
trip to San Diego.
Freshman Jay Johnston tickled
the twines four times to lead
Stanford to this high-scoring
victory. But the high score does
not indicate the real key to this or
any of Stanford's recent victories.
Goalie Rich Bragdon turned in
another stellar performance,
making clutch saves at three
different times when California
threatened to take the lead.
Bragdon had performed only
marginally earlier this quarter
during the Cardinal slump. "He
lacked concentration," said
player-coach Pat Baldwin.

Baldwin was quick to add that in
the past three games, "Bragdon
had shown guts — a real
determination that wasn't there a
month ago."
Last Friday evening, Stanford
squeaked by the San Diego State
Aztecs 3-1. Bragdon's goal-tending
provided the margin as the Aztecs
outshot Stanford 28-23. It was all
Stanford the following evening,
however. The skating Cards left
no doubt as to which was the
better team, romping 8-4 behind
another four-goal effort by
Johnston.
The unsung hero of the current
hot streak has undoubtedly been
senior Rich Jaros. Jaros left San
Diego with two goals and four
assists. He was thus responsible
for six of the 11 goals scored in
San Diego.
The Cards have made quite a
turnaround after a seven-game
winless streak, which they
snapped just 10 days ago. They
are playing well as a unit and do
not at all resemble the Cardinal
team which was thrashed by
Belmont 9-2 only two weeks ago.
The Cards now have their
sights set on the league playoffs in
early April. There is also the
possibility of an invitation to a
tournament in San D'ego in late
April with San Diego State, UCLA
and Arizona State.
The next Stanford game is
against the arch-rival Belmont
Buffies Tuesday at Belmont
Iceland at 8 p.m. Live coverage of
second period action will begin at
9 p.m. on KZSU.

Stanford's game against Santa Clara was rained out. The game has not been officially rescheduled, but there is a possibility that the two teams

aftermath of last weekend's road
trip to San Diego.
Freshman Jay Johnston tickled
the twines four times to lead
Stanford to this high-scoring
victory. But the high score does
not indicate the real key to this or
any of Stanford's recent victories.
Goalie Rich Bragdon turned in
another stellar performance,
making clutch saves at three
different times when California
threatened to take the lead.
Bragdon had performed only
marginally earlier this quarter
during the Cardinal slump. "He
lacked concentration," said
player-coach Pat Baldwin.

Baldwin was quick to add that in
the past three games, "Bragdon
had shown guts — a real
determination that wasn't there a
month ago."
Last Friday evening, Stanford
squeaked by the San Diego State
Aztecs 3-1. Bragdon's goal-tending
provided the margin as the Aztecs
outshot Stanford 28-23. It was all
Stanford the following evening,
however. The skating Cards left
no doubt as to which was the
better team, romping 8-4 behind
another four-goal effort by
Johnston.
The unsung hero of the current
hot streak has undoubtedly been
senior Rich Jaros. Jaros left San
Diego with two goals and four
assists. He was thus responsible
for six of the 11 goals scored in
San Diego.
The Cards have made quite a
turnaround after a seven-game
winless streak, which they
snapped just 10 days ago. They
are playing well as a unit and do
not at all resemble the Cardinal
team which was thrashed by
Belmont 9-2 only two weeks ago.
The Cards now have their
sights set on the league playoffs in
early April. There is also the
possibility of an invitation to a
tournament in San D'ego in late
April with San Diego State, UCLA
and Arizona State.
The next Stanford game is
against the arch-rival Belmont
Buffies Tuesday at Belmont
Iceland at 8 p.m. Live coverage of
second period action will begin at
9 p.m. on KZSU.

SAFE AT HOME-Gary Bei crosses the platywith one of Stanford's 16 runs during Saturday's opening doubleheader against USF. Yesterday,
Stanford's game against Santa Clara was rained out. The game has not been officially rescheduled, but there is a possibility that the two teams
may square off this afternoon at 2 p.m. at Sunken Diamond. The Cardinals are 1-1 on the season, having lost to USF 10-8 in Saturday's first
game before taking the nightcap, 8-7.
Stanford's ice hockey team
won its fourth straight game
Monday night, outscoring the
California Golden Bears 10-8 at
Legg's Arena in San Francisco.
This contest was the Cards' third
in four days. Still, they showed
little sign of fatigue, even in the
aftermath of last weekend's road
trip to San Diego.
