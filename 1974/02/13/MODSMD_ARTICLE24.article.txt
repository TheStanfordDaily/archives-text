# JV Netmen Host Canada In Opener
## 
### 
The event won't be quite as
spectacular as the USC and UCLA
matches, parts of which will be
held at Maples Pavilion in April,
but Stanford's tennis season
officially opens this afternoon
when the Cardinal junior varsity
hosts Canada College on the
Stanford courts beginning at 2:30.
Canada is the defending state
junior college champion, and is
favored to repeat, according to
Stanford coach Dick Gould.
Gould anticipates a tough match,
and plans to use a lineup similar
to the one he'll use against Cal
State-Bakersfield in the varsity
season opener on Friday.
That lineup features Craig
Johnson at the first singles
position. Johnson faces a rough
match today, probably against
Canada's top player, Andy
Lucchesi. Tim Noonan, who's
been playing unusually well in
practice, will play second singles,
with Jake Warde at the third
singles slot.
Rounding out the singles
lineup are Gary Adelman,
Alejandro Cortes and Brian Hahn,
at fourth, fifth and sixth singles,
respectively. The doubles slots
haven't yet been determined.
Last year, the Stanford JV beat
Canada, but, as the Redwood City
school has been impressive in
tournaments thus far this season,
this year's opener may not
necessarily end in the same result.
