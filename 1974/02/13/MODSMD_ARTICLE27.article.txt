# Pro Prognosis
## Obnoxious Milt 
### Don Tollefson 
Many sports fans would claim it is impossible to find a TV sports
personality who is more obnoxious than Howard Cosell. Yet despite
all his egotism, pomposity and vocal theatrics, Cosell is fairly
knowledgeable about at least two of the sports he covers — boxing
and football.
Cosell should be commended for shaking up a tradition-bound
profession which for so long had been dominated by people like Chris
Schenkel, who believes you shouldn't criticize athletes because their
parents might be watching. That way fumbles and interceptions are
always the result of "great defensive plays" and are never caused by
offensive mistakes. It's like having Dale Carnegie doing the
play-by-play with Norman Vincent Peale adding color.
Howard still puts both of his feet in his mouth at times, as he did
during the Riggs-King match, but ever since Cosell and Muhammad Ali
began furthering each other's career with their verbal duels, the world
of sports has been considerably more open and provocative.
The sports world has experienced some rough times in recent years
and while many sportscasters were glossing over the problems so they
wouldn't lose their complimentary tickets, Cosell was at least bringing
the important issues into public focus. The sporting establishment
usually criticizes Cosell with a vengeance, but it can never ignore him.
For in the end, it is the fact that he really does have something to
say that enables Cosell to survive with a style that even his greatest
admirers often find annoying. Keeping that fact in mind, picture if
you will a sportscaster who is considerably more brash, pompous and
obnoxious than Cosell, but who lacks any foundation of knowledge.
Meet Milt Kahn.
Nightmares
Kahn, the new sportscaster at KPIX, is the kind of guy your
daughter brought home in your most horrible nightmares. He
combines the sports knowledge of Zsa Zsa Gabor with the tact of Don
Rickles and the appearance of Soupy Sales.
The first time I saw Kahn I seriously contemplated destruction of
my TV set. But since I was feeling unusually compassionate at the
time, I decided to reserve final judgment of Milt until I had endured
him for at least a week. Rarely have seven days been so filled with
cruel and unusual punishment.
Athletes who are famous for their monosyllabic responses seem to
be great orators compared to the way Kahn stumbles and fumbles
through even the simplest of questions.
The cornerstone of Milt's approach to journalism seems to be
"never let the facts get in the way of a good story." He considers
scores to be a waste of time and when he does give them, he often
leaves out the most important ones. At least he's consistent.
Despite the fact that he's only been in the Bay Area a matter of
weeks, Milt's already an expert on all the local teams and sports
figures. Two local personalities seem to particularly fascinate him and
rare is the night when he doesn't reiterate his feelings towards them.
Nightly victim No. 1 is Giants' manager Charlie Fox. Fox is a
mediocre manager and I'm sure the Giants would be more successful
with a Dick Williams at the helm. But Kahn's major rationale for firing
Fox seems to be the fact that Milt Kahn says he should be fired. How
could the logic be any simpler?
Circus Side Show
Nightly victim No. 2 is Billie Jean King. Recently Kahn said that
women's tennis was like "a side show at the circus," and he compared
it to roller derby and pro wrestling. Compared to Milt, Bobby Riggs
sounds like a radical feminist.
What makes the whole Kahn affair all the more ludicrous is that the
Bay Area's most competent sportscaster, Barry Tompkins, was fired
to make room for Milt. It seems that in the wasteland of Bay Area
television news, journalistic competence is a severe liability.
Unlike Kahn, Tompkins actually knew a fair amount about sports.
When he did venture an opinion on a subject he was knowledgeable
about, Tompkins had the good journalistic sense to back his ideas
with the opinions of other experienced observers. It is that kind of
educated analysis and commentary that makes for the type of solid
sports journalism which Kahn never practices.
Sports journalism is badly polluted by the presence of too many
poor writers, public relations types and irresponsible journalists who
try to create controversies out of everything. There are unfortunately
too many Milt Kahns in both the print and broadcast ends of the
profession.
Until the public demands better TV journalism, Kahn and his
cohorts will continue to drag it down to the level of a "B" grade soap
opera. So when you get home tonight, settle your stomach and watch
Milt at 6, 7 or 11 p.m. Then while your memory is vivid, mail your
reactions to KPIX. Anyone who helps get him fired should be
considered for a Pulitzer Prize.

play-by-play with Norman Vincent Peale adding color.
Howard still puts both of his feet in his mouth at times, as he did
during the Riggs-King match, but ever since Cosell and Muhammad Ali
began furthering each other's career with their verbal duels, the world
of sports has been considerably more open and provocative.
The sports world has experienced some rough times in recent years
and while many sportscasters were glossing over the problems so they
wouldn't lose their complimentary tickets, Cosell was at least bringing
the important issues into public focus. The sporting establishment
usually criticizes Cosell with a vengeance, but it can never ignore him.
For in the end, it is the fact that he really does have something to
say that enables Cosell to survive with a style that even his greatest
admirers often find annoying. Keeping that fact in mind, picture if
you will a sportscaster who is considerably more brash, pompous and
obnoxious than Cosell, but who lacks any foundation of knowledge.
Meet Milt Kahn.
Nightmares
Kahn, the new sportscaster at KPIX, is the kind of guy your
daughter brought home in your most horrible nightmares. He
combines the sports knowledge of Zsa Zsa Gabor with the tact of Don
Rickles and the appearance of Soupy Sales.
The first time I saw Kahn I seriously contemplated destruction of
my TV set. But since I was feeling unusually compassionate at the
time, I decided to reserve final judgment of Milt until I had endured
him for at least a week. Rarely have seven days been so filled with
cruel and unusual punishment.
Athletes who are famous for their monosyllabic responses seem to
be great orators compared to the way Kahn stumbles and fumbles
through even the simplest of questions.
The cornerstone of Milt's approach to journalism seems to be
"never let the facts get in the way of a good story." He considers
scores to be a waste of time and when he does give them, he often
leaves out the most important ones. At least he's consistent.
Despite the fact that he's only been in the Bay Area a matter of
weeks, Milt's already an expert on all the local teams and sports
figures. Two local personalities seem to particularly fascinate him and
rare is the night when he doesn't reiterate his feelings towards them.
Nightly victim No. 1 is Giants' manager Charlie Fox. Fox is a
mediocre manager and I'm sure the Giants would be more successful
with a Dick Williams at the helm. But Kahn's major rationale for firing
Fox seems to be the fact that Milt Kahn says he should be fired. How
could the logic be any simpler?
Circus Side Show
Nightly victim No. 2 is Billie Jean King. Recently Kahn said that
women's tennis was like "a side show at the circus," and he compared
it to roller derby and pro wrestling. Compared to Milt, Bobby Riggs
sounds like a radical feminist.
What makes the whole Kahn affair all the more ludicrous is that the
Bay Area's most competent sportscaster, Barry Tompkins, was fired
to make room for Milt. It seems that in the wasteland of Bay Area
television news, journalistic competence is a severe liability.
Unlike Kahn, Tompkins actually knew a fair amount about sports.
When he did venture an opinion on a subject he was knowledgeable
about, Tompkins had the good journalistic sense to back his ideas
with the opinions of other experienced observers. It is that kind of
educated analysis and commentary that makes for the type of solid
sports journalism which Kahn never practices.
Sports journalism is badly polluted by the presence of too many
poor writers, public relations types and irresponsible journalists who
try to create controversies out of everything. There are unfortunately
too many Milt Kahns in both the print and broadcast ends of the
profession.
Until the public demands better TV journalism, Kahn and his
cohorts will continue to drag it down to the level of a "B" grade soap
opera. So when you get home tonight, settle your stomach and watch
Milt at 6, 7 or 11 p.m. Then while your memory is vivid, mail your
reactions to KPIX. Anyone who helps get him fired should be
considered for a Pulitzer Prize.
Many sports fans would claim it is impossible to find a TV sports
personality who is more obnoxious than Howard Cosell. Yet despite
all his egotism, pomposity and vocal theatrics, Cosell is fairly
knowledgeable about at least two of the sports he covers — boxing
and football.
Cosell should be commended for shaking up a tradition-bound
profession which for so long had been dominated by people like Chris
Schenkel, who believes you shouldn't criticize athletes because their
parents might be watching. That way fumbles and interceptions are
always the result of "great defensive plays" and are never caused by
offensive mistakes. It's like having Dale Carnegie doing the
play-by-play with Norman Vincent Peale adding color.

usually criticizes Cosell with a vengeance, but it can never ignore him.
For in the end, it is the fact that he really does have something to
say that enables Cosell to survive with a style that even his greatest
admirers often find annoying. Keeping that fact in mind, picture if
you will a sportscaster who is considerably more brash, pompous and
obnoxious than Cosell, but who lacks any foundation of knowledge.
Meet Milt Kahn.
Nightmares
Kahn, the new sportscaster at KPIX, is the kind of guy your
daughter brought home in your most horrible nightmares. He
combines the sports knowledge of Zsa Zsa Gabor with the tact of Don
Rickles and the appearance of Soupy Sales.
The first time I saw Kahn I seriously contemplated destruction of
my TV set. But since I was feeling unusually compassionate at the
time, I decided to reserve final judgment of Milt until I had endured
him for at least a week. Rarely have seven days been so filled with
cruel and unusual punishment.
Athletes who are famous for their monosyllabic responses seem to
be great orators compared to the way Kahn stumbles and fumbles
through even the simplest of questions.
The cornerstone of Milt's approach to journalism seems to be
"never let the facts get in the way of a good story." He considers
scores to be a waste of time and when he does give them, he often
leaves out the most important ones. At least he's consistent.
Despite the fact that he's only been in the Bay Area a matter of
weeks, Milt's already an expert on all the local teams and sports
figures. Two local personalities seem to particularly fascinate him and
rare is the night when he doesn't reiterate his feelings towards them.
Nightly victim No. 1 is Giants' manager Charlie Fox. Fox is a
mediocre manager and I'm sure the Giants would be more successful
with a Dick Williams at the helm. But Kahn's major rationale for firing
Fox seems to be the fact that Milt Kahn says he should be fired. How
could the logic be any simpler?
Circus Side Show
Nightly victim No. 2 is Billie Jean King. Recently Kahn said that
women's tennis was like "a side show at the circus," and he compared
it to roller derby and pro wrestling. Compared to Milt, Bobby Riggs
sounds like a radical feminist.
What makes the whole Kahn affair all the more ludicrous is that the
Bay Area's most competent sportscaster, Barry Tompkins, was fired
to make room for Milt. It seems that in the wasteland of Bay Area
television news, journalistic competence is a severe liability.
Unlike Kahn, Tompkins actually knew a fair amount about sports.
When he did venture an opinion on a subject he was knowledgeable
about, Tompkins had the good journalistic sense to back his ideas
with the opinions of other experienced observers. It is that kind of
educated analysis and commentary that makes for the type of solid
sports journalism which Kahn never practices.
Sports journalism is badly polluted by the presence of too many
poor writers, public relations types and irresponsible journalists who
try to create controversies out of everything. There are unfortunately
too many Milt Kahns in both the print and broadcast ends of the
profession.
Until the public demands better TV journalism, Kahn and his
cohorts will continue to drag it down to the level of a "B" grade soap
opera. So when you get home tonight, settle your stomach and watch
Milt at 6, 7 or 11 p.m. Then while your memory is vivid, mail your
reactions to KPIX. Anyone who helps get him fired should be
considered for a Pulitzer Prize.
