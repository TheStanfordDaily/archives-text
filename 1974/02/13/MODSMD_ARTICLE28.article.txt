# Puidokas Will Play
## WSU's Big Man Back In Lineup 
### 
Washington State's 6-15.V2
center Steve Puidokas, who
missed last weekend's games in
the Bay Area because of a
fractured cheekbone, is expected
to play this weekend when
Stanford and California travel to
the Northwest for a pair of
rematches.
"Unless something unforeseen
happens, we expect him to play,"
a Washington State spokesman
said yesterday. Puidokas
underwent surgery Thursday, but
the spokesman said "it's not a
major thing — at least in medical
terms."
Puidokas, who leads the Pac-8
in scoring with a 21.0 average and
ranks fourth in rebounding with a
10.0 mark, will probably wear a
protective mask when the Cougars
(2-5, 7-14) host the Cards (3-4,
9-9) Saturday night at WSU's new
Performing Arts Coliseum. Cal
visits Pullman Monday night,
while Stanford travels to Seattle
to meet Washington (2-5, 11-8).
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
said yesterday that although his
hot Cardinals "haven't been
mathematically eliminated from
contention for second place,
we've got enough on our minds
just thinking about Saturday's
game in Pullman."
Dallmar said that "one key
factor in our four straight
victories has been our rebounding
supremacy." Stanford currently
ranks second in the Pac-8 in
rebounding margin (+3.9), trailing
only UCLA (+8.7). The Cards are
second in the league in scoring
margin, second in team defense,
sixth in field goal percentage,'
seventh in free throw percentage
and seventh in team offense.
UCLA leads in all six team
categories, while Bill Walton is the
only player who ranks in the top
10 in all five individual categories.
Both Stanford games this
weekend will be broadcast on
KSFO (560 AM). Air times are
8:05 Saturday from Pullman and
8 p.m. Monday from Seattle.
