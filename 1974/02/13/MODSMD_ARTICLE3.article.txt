# 'Issue On Lyman's Desk'
## Shaw: 'Row Project May Be Moved' 
### BILL ROSS 
The proposed emeriti housing
project may yet be moved to a
location elsewhere on campus, Ed
Shaw, executive assistant to the vice
president and provost, asserted on
KZSU's "Campus Conference"
program last night.
"The issue is squarely on President
Lyman's desk," Shaw said. "It is now
his responsibility to decide whether to
reconsider the matter or to allow the

project to continue as planned."
Shaw emphasized that if a
reconsideration is undertaken, it will
be a free, open and thorough review
that will ponder all proposed
possibilities.
At the present time, the University
is planning to construct a 100-unit
apartment complex on the Row, at the
site of the old Stanford elementary
school. Row residents have
complained that the project would
disturb the character of their
neighborhood. In an ASSU
referendum last week, 95 percent of
the students who voted expressed
disapproval of the project.
Student opinion will exert some
influence on the University's decision
whether or not to continue the
project, Shaw said. But the fact that
student residency on the Row is
ephemeral, while the faculty would be
permanent residents of the area,
reduces the impact of student views.
Ample Opportunity
In making its decision to locate the
housing development on the Row, the
University tried to consult students as
much as possible, Shaw stated.
Although the University could have
taken a more active role in seeking

student input, Stanford allowed
students ample opportunity to make
their views known, he said.
In response to complaints that the
difference in lifestyles and noise levels
of emeriti faculty and students would
precipitate conflict between the two
groups, Shaw declared that the
possibility of friction has been
exaggerated.
Shaw said that last May he moved
into a house located a block and a half
from the apartment complex site, and
has not been particularly bothered by
students.
Resilient Emeriti
"This is a residential community. It
probably is best for students and
faculty members to live near each
other," Shaw said. "Many of the
senior and retired faculty members
want to live in the midst of students. I
don't want to minimize the problem,
but we tend to underestimate the
resilience of the emeriti."
Approximately half of the emeriti
who responded to a housing

survey conducted by the University
expressed a desire to live "close in" to
the campus, Shaw said. This was
generally understood to mean the
Row, although it was not stated
explicitly on the questionnaire, he
explained.
Contrary to popular opinion, the
proposed three story complex would
not conflict with the architectural
style of the Row houses, which were
built at the turn of the century, Shaw
said. While the complex was designed
by the same architect who planned
Escondido Village, the structures
would not be built in the modern style
of the Village high-rises.
If the Row project were moved to
another location, the area along
Bowdoin would be a potential site,
Shaw stated. Several other regions also
have been considered, including the
present site of Manzanita Park, Shaw
said.
The plan could be transferred to
another site without incurring
prohibitive costs, Shaw noted.
