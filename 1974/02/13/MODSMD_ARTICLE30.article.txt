Arab nations will hold a summit today in Algeria to
discuss disengagement of the Syrian and Israeli armies, the
Algerian Embassy in Paris and official sources in Cairo said
yesterday.
Middle East diplomats consider Syrian-Israeli military
disengagement a necessary step before there can be any
Arab-Israeli peace talks on territorial issues or a
modification of the oil embargo on the United States.
The official Algerian news agency said the participants in
the Algiers disengagement talks will include Syria and
Egypt, the principal combatants against Israeli in last
October's war. Egyptian and Israeli armies are being
separated on the Suez Canal front.
Other countries represented at the Algiers conference
will be Algeria and Saudi Arabia, the news agency said. The
head of state of Kuwait also might attend, said a spokesman
for the Algerian Embassy in Paris.
Iraq, one of the most vociferous Arab opponents of U.S.
Middle East policies since the Arab-Israeli war last October,
will boycott the Arab oil meeting on Thursday, Baghdad
radio said.
"Iraq will not take part in the Tripoli conference
because it is designed exclusively for discussing the
possibility of lifting the anti-U.S. embargos," the broadcast
said.
Arab oil ministers gather in Tripoli tomorrow.
Libya Nationalizes U.S. Oil Holdings
President Moammar Khadafy of Libya ordered 51
percent takeover of all foreign oil holdings in his country
last September. On Monday the government nationalized
the other 49 percent of the California Asiatic Co., owned
by Standard Oil of California; the American Overseas
Petroleum Co., owned by California Asiatic and Texaco;
and the Libyan-American Oil Co., owned by Atlantic
Richfield.
The nationalized properties produced only 124,000
barrels of crude oil a day, or about 5 percent of Libya's
total daily production.
The other American companies operating in Libya are
Mobil, which produces 120,000 barrels a day; Oasis, jointly
operated by Continental, Marathon Amerada Hess and
Royal Dutch Shell, and producing 700,000 barrels daily;
Occidental Petroleum, 370,000 barrels a day; Amoco —
Standard Oil of Indiana — whose daily production of 6,000
barrels was suspended by the Arab oil embargo because it
went to the United States.
The Christian Science Monitor reported that Saudi
Arabia will soon demand that four American companies
give up their 75 percent of the Arabian American Oil Co.
Saudi Arabia owns the other 25 percent.
The companies — Exxon, Texaco, Standard Oil of
California and Mobil — would get $1.5 billion for their
interests, the Monitor said in quoting highly reliable
sources.
Aramco pumps 7.1 million barrels of oil each day,
compared with 8.8 million before the Arab oil cutbacks.
Gas Plan Not Complete Sueeess
Odd-even rationing plans cut some gasoline waiting lines
yesterday, but the programs were far from a complete
success. Service station operators complained that they
didn't want the burden of enforcing the largely voluntary
programs.
The White House said yesterday that President Nixon
will assess the effects of various state allocation plans
before recommending any change in federal gas rationing
policy.
Federal energy chief William E. Simon has said
previously that rationing, if imposed, will not go into effect
before March. Meanwhile, he asked motorists to limit
themselves voluntarily to 10 gallons per week.
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon was
well aware of the long lines at gasoline stations in some
areas.
Warren added, however; "The President will not say to a
governor, you should or should not do this or that. . . The
President favors voluntary actions, doing what each state
believes is necessary."
The press side said Oregon —wherea voluntary rationing
program was instituted Jan. 14 — was a "good example of a
state where a form of gas rationing has improved the
situation."

Reineeke Loeated After Seeret Trip
SACRAMENTO — With the cloud of the ITT scandal
hanging over his head, Lt. Gov. Ed Reineeke was located
yesterday registered at a Washington, D.C. hotel after
leaving California secretively.
A Reineeke aide refused comment on whether the
lieutenant governor's trip was connected to a current
Watergate grand jury probe of the International Telephone
and Telegraph Corp. antitrust case.
The aide press secretary Earl Parker, replied "no
comment" to almost all questions, saying only: "He's on
personal business. I'm just following lieutenant governor's
instructions."
Shortly before his unexplained disappearance from the
California capitol Monday, Reineeke said in a series of
interviews he intends to clear his name in the ITT case
before launching his campaign for the Republican
nomination for governor.
"I have done absolutely nothing wrong. There was no
perjury," Reineeke said.
Reineeke made a similar unexplained trip to Washington
last week. He refused after that trip to discuss the nature of
his business there. He would neither confirm nor deny
whether he appeared before the grand jury or conferred
with the Watergate prosecutor on that trip.
Originally Reineeke was scheduled to spend Monday
kicking off his gubernatorial campaign with press
conferences around the state. He has led voter preference
polls for the nomination among Republican voters, but has
lost key supporters in recent weeks to state Controller
Houston Flournoy, the only other major GOP contender.
Gas Dealer Favoritism Ruled Illegal
SAN FRANCISCO - Gasoline and diesel fuel dealers may
not change their normal business practice to sell fuel only
to regular customers, the Internal Revenue Service said
yesterday.
The Federal Energy Office in Washington issued a
regulation yesterday under which petroleum suppliers
including ratailers may not discriminate among purchasers
of allocated petroleum products.
The regulation also prohibits new arrangements
involving volume sales by retailers, said Greg Crosby, IRS
public affairs officer.
For example, he said, it is illegal for a retailer to sign up
a customer to buy 1,000 gallons, $50 worth or a month's
requirements in advance.
Violating the regulation can bring a civil penalty of
$2,500 or a criminal penalty of $5,000 for each violation.
Crosby said the regulation does not apply to voluntary
rationing plans such as those being put into effect in Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz Counties or those being carried out in
Oregon and other states.
Crosby said that if a customer is unable to resolve the
matter after calling the regulation to the attention of the
service station, he should contact his local IRS office.
13-Nation Oil Panel To Meet A^ain
WASHINGTON — The 13-nation Washington energy
conference agreed yesterday night to adjourn its session
until today in order to work on a compromise communique
that will outline the next step to be taken toward meeting
the energy crisis.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told newsmen "We
are coming back tomorrow, and we will be meeting during
the night to work on the communique."
An American draft is being examined by representatives
of all 13 nations in an effort to win an agreement with all
of the participating nations, particularly France.
Earlier France had balked at the American communique,
which spoke of setting up a committee to prepare for later
meetings to include less developed countries as well as
petroleum producing countries.
A proposal to use the petroleum committee of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
was turned down by the French. The U.S. also was cool to
this proposal, which was understood to have come from
Italian and British sources.
Kissinger and French Foreign Minister Michel Jobert met
during the afternoon in an effort to reach agreement.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow. Slightly warmer
days. Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today in the 50s and
tomorrow in the mid 50s to mid 60s. West to northwest
winds 10 to 20 mph.

Mobil, which produces 120,000 barrels a day; Oasis, jointly
operated by Continental, Marathon Amerada Hess and
Royal Dutch Shell, and producing 700,000 barrels daily;
Occidental Petroleum, 370,000 barrels a day; Amoco —
Standard Oil of Indiana — whose daily production of 6,000
barrels was suspended by the Arab oil embargo because it
went to the United States.
The Christian Science Monitor reported that Saudi
Arabia will soon demand that four American companies
give up their 75 percent of the Arabian American Oil Co.
Saudi Arabia owns the other 25 percent.
The companies — Exxon, Texaco, Standard Oil of
California and Mobil — would get $1.5 billion for their
interests, the Monitor said in quoting highly reliable
sources.
Aramco pumps 7.1 million barrels of oil each day,
compared with 8.8 million before the Arab oil cutbacks.
Gas Plan Not Complete Sueeess
Odd-even rationing plans cut some gasoline waiting lines
yesterday, but the programs were far from a complete
success. Service station operators complained that they
didn't want the burden of enforcing the largely voluntary
programs.
The White House said yesterday that President Nixon
will assess the effects of various state allocation plans
before recommending any change in federal gas rationing
policy.
Federal energy chief William E. Simon has said
previously that rationing, if imposed, will not go into effect
before March. Meanwhile, he asked motorists to limit
themselves voluntarily to 10 gallons per week.
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon was
well aware of the long lines at gasoline stations in some
areas.
Warren added, however; "The President will not say to a
governor, you should or should not do this or that. . . The
President favors voluntary actions, doing what each state
believes is necessary."
The press side said Oregon —wherea voluntary rationing
program was instituted Jan. 14 — was a "good example of a
state where a form of gas rationing has improved the
situation."

Reineeke Loeated After Seeret Trip
SACRAMENTO — With the cloud of the ITT scandal
hanging over his head, Lt. Gov. Ed Reineeke was located
yesterday registered at a Washington, D.C. hotel after
leaving California secretively.
A Reineeke aide refused comment on whether the
lieutenant governor's trip was connected to a current
Watergate grand jury probe of the International Telephone
and Telegraph Corp. antitrust case.
The aide press secretary Earl Parker, replied "no
comment" to almost all questions, saying only: "He's on
personal business. I'm just following lieutenant governor's
instructions."
Shortly before his unexplained disappearance from the
California capitol Monday, Reineeke said in a series of
interviews he intends to clear his name in the ITT case
before launching his campaign for the Republican
nomination for governor.
"I have done absolutely nothing wrong. There was no
perjury," Reineeke said.
Reineeke made a similar unexplained trip to Washington
last week. He refused after that trip to discuss the nature of
his business there. He would neither confirm nor deny
whether he appeared before the grand jury or conferred
with the Watergate prosecutor on that trip.
Originally Reineeke was scheduled to spend Monday
kicking off his gubernatorial campaign with press
conferences around the state. He has led voter preference
polls for the nomination among Republican voters, but has
lost key supporters in recent weeks to state Controller
Houston Flournoy, the only other major GOP contender.
Gas Dealer Favoritism Ruled Illegal
SAN FRANCISCO - Gasoline and diesel fuel dealers may
not change their normal business practice to sell fuel only
to regular customers, the Internal Revenue Service said
yesterday.
The Federal Energy Office in Washington issued a
regulation yesterday under which petroleum suppliers
including ratailers may not discriminate among purchasers
of allocated petroleum products.
The regulation also prohibits new arrangements
involving volume sales by retailers, said Greg Crosby, IRS
public affairs officer.
For example, he said, it is illegal for a retailer to sign up
a customer to buy 1,000 gallons, $50 worth or a month's
requirements in advance.
Violating the regulation can bring a civil penalty of
$2,500 or a criminal penalty of $5,000 for each violation.
Crosby said the regulation does not apply to voluntary
rationing plans such as those being put into effect in Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz Counties or those being carried out in
Oregon and other states.
Crosby said that if a customer is unable to resolve the
matter after calling the regulation to the attention of the
service station, he should contact his local IRS office.
13-Nation Oil Panel To Meet A^ain
WASHINGTON — The 13-nation Washington energy
conference agreed yesterday night to adjourn its session
until today in order to work on a compromise communique
that will outline the next step to be taken toward meeting
the energy crisis.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told newsmen "We
are coming back tomorrow, and we will be meeting during
the night to work on the communique."
An American draft is being examined by representatives
of all 13 nations in an effort to win an agreement with all
of the participating nations, particularly France.
Earlier France had balked at the American communique,
which spoke of setting up a committee to prepare for later
meetings to include less developed countries as well as
petroleum producing countries.
A proposal to use the petroleum committee of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
was turned down by the French. The U.S. also was cool to
this proposal, which was understood to have come from
Italian and British sources.
Kissinger and French Foreign Minister Michel Jobert met
during the afternoon in an effort to reach agreement.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow. Slightly warmer
days. Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today in the 50s and
tomorrow in the mid 50s to mid 60s. West to northwest
winds 10 to 20 mph.

Arab nations will hold a summit today in Algeria to
discuss disengagement of the Syrian and Israeli armies, the
Algerian Embassy in Paris and official sources in Cairo said
yesterday.
Middle East diplomats consider Syrian-Israeli military
disengagement a necessary step before there can be any
Arab-Israeli peace talks on territorial issues or a
modification of the oil embargo on the United States.
The official Algerian news agency said the participants in
the Algiers disengagement talks will include Syria and
Egypt, the principal combatants against Israeli in last
October's war. Egyptian and Israeli armies are being
separated on the Suez Canal front.
Other countries represented at the Algiers conference
will be Algeria and Saudi Arabia, the news agency said. The
head of state of Kuwait also might attend, said a spokesman
for the Algerian Embassy in Paris.
Iraq, one of the most vociferous Arab opponents of U.S.
Middle East policies since the Arab-Israeli war last October,
will boycott the Arab oil meeting on Thursday, Baghdad
radio said.
"Iraq will not take part in the Tripoli conference
because it is designed exclusively for discussing the
possibility of lifting the anti-U.S. embargos," the broadcast
said.
Arab oil ministers gather in Tripoli tomorrow.
Libya Nationalizes U.S. Oil Holdings
President Moammar Khadafy of Libya ordered 51
percent takeover of all foreign oil holdings in his country
last September. On Monday the government nationalized
the other 49 percent of the California Asiatic Co., owned
by Standard Oil of California; the American Overseas
Petroleum Co., owned by California Asiatic and Texaco;
and the Libyan-American Oil Co., owned by Atlantic
Richfield.
The nationalized properties produced only 124,000
barrels of crude oil a day, or about 5 percent of Libya's
total daily production.
The other American companies operating in Libya are
Mobil, which produces 120,000 barrels a day; Oasis, jointly

state where a form of gas rationing has improved the
situation."

Reineeke Loeated After Seeret Trip
SACRAMENTO — With the cloud of the ITT scandal
hanging over his head, Lt. Gov. Ed Reineeke was located
yesterday registered at a Washington, D.C. hotel after
leaving California secretively.
A Reineeke aide refused comment on whether the
lieutenant governor's trip was connected to a current
Watergate grand jury probe of the International Telephone
and Telegraph Corp. antitrust case.
The aide press secretary Earl Parker, replied "no
comment" to almost all questions, saying only: "He's on
personal business. I'm just following lieutenant governor's
instructions."
Shortly before his unexplained disappearance from the
California capitol Monday, Reineeke said in a series of
interviews he intends to clear his name in the ITT case
before launching his campaign for the Republican
nomination for governor.
"I have done absolutely nothing wrong. There was no
perjury," Reineeke said.
Reineeke made a similar unexplained trip to Washington
last week. He refused after that trip to discuss the nature of
his business there. He would neither confirm nor deny
whether he appeared before the grand jury or conferred
with the Watergate prosecutor on that trip.
Originally Reineeke was scheduled to spend Monday
kicking off his gubernatorial campaign with press
conferences around the state. He has led voter preference
polls for the nomination among Republican voters, but has
lost key supporters in recent weeks to state Controller
Houston Flournoy, the only other major GOP contender.
Gas Dealer Favoritism Ruled Illegal
SAN FRANCISCO - Gasoline and diesel fuel dealers may
not change their normal business practice to sell fuel only
to regular customers, the Internal Revenue Service said
yesterday.
The Federal Energy Office in Washington issued a
regulation yesterday under which petroleum suppliers
including ratailers may not discriminate among purchasers
of allocated petroleum products.
The regulation also prohibits new arrangements
involving volume sales by retailers, said Greg Crosby, IRS
public affairs officer.
For example, he said, it is illegal for a retailer to sign up
a customer to buy 1,000 gallons, $50 worth or a month's
requirements in advance.
Violating the regulation can bring a civil penalty of
$2,500 or a criminal penalty of $5,000 for each violation.
Crosby said the regulation does not apply to voluntary
rationing plans such as those being put into effect in Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz Counties or those being carried out in
Oregon and other states.
Crosby said that if a customer is unable to resolve the
matter after calling the regulation to the attention of the
service station, he should contact his local IRS office.
13-Nation Oil Panel To Meet A^ain
WASHINGTON — The 13-nation Washington energy
conference agreed yesterday night to adjourn its session
until today in order to work on a compromise communique
that will outline the next step to be taken toward meeting
the energy crisis.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told newsmen "We
are coming back tomorrow, and we will be meeting during
the night to work on the communique."
An American draft is being examined by representatives
of all 13 nations in an effort to win an agreement with all
of the participating nations, particularly France.
Earlier France had balked at the American communique,
which spoke of setting up a committee to prepare for later
meetings to include less developed countries as well as
petroleum producing countries.
A proposal to use the petroleum committee of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
was turned down by the French. The U.S. also was cool to
this proposal, which was understood to have come from
Italian and British sources.
Kissinger and French Foreign Minister Michel Jobert met
during the afternoon in an effort to reach agreement.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow. Slightly warmer
days. Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today in the 50s and
tomorrow in the mid 50s to mid 60s. West to northwest
winds 10 to 20 mph.
Arabs To I) iseuss Mideast li«ilitin«i
Arab nations will hold a summit today in Algeria to
discuss disengagement of the Syrian and Israeli armies, the
Algerian Embassy in Paris and official sources in Cairo said
yesterday.
Middle East diplomats consider Syrian-Israeli military
disengagement a necessary step before there can be any
Arab-Israeli peace talks on territorial issues or a
modification of the oil embargo on the United States.
The official Algerian news agency said the participants in
the Algiers disengagement talks will include Syria and
Egypt, the principal combatants against Israeli in last
October's war. Egyptian and Israeli armies are being
separated on the Suez Canal front.
Other countries represented at the Algiers conference
will be Algeria and Saudi Arabia, the news agency said. The
head of state of Kuwait also might attend, said a spokesman
for the Algerian Embassy in Paris.
Iraq, one of the most vociferous Arab opponents of U.S.
Middle East policies since the Arab-Israeli war last October,
will boycott the Arab oil meeting on Thursday, Baghdad
radio said.
"Iraq will not take part in the Tripoli conference
because it is designed exclusively for discussing the
possibility of lifting the anti-U.S. embargos," the broadcast
said.
Arab oil ministers gather in Tripoli tomorrow.
Libya Nationalizes U.S. Oil Holdings
President Moammar Khadafy of Libya ordered 51
percent takeover of all foreign oil holdings in his country
last September. On Monday the government nationalized
the other 49 percent of the California Asiatic Co., owned
by Standard Oil of California; the American Overseas
Petroleum Co., owned by California Asiatic and Texaco;
and the Libyan-American Oil Co., owned by Atlantic
Richfield.
The nationalized properties produced only 124,000
barrels of crude oil a day, or about 5 percent of Libya's
total daily production.
The other American companies operating in Libya are
Mobil, which produces 120,000 barrels a day; Oasis, jointly
operated by Continental, Marathon Amerada Hess and
Royal Dutch Shell, and producing 700,000 barrels daily;
Occidental Petroleum, 370,000 barrels a day; Amoco —
Standard Oil of Indiana — whose daily production of 6,000
barrels was suspended by the Arab oil embargo because it
went to the United States.
The Christian Science Monitor reported that Saudi
Arabia will soon demand that four American companies
give up their 75 percent of the Arabian American Oil Co.
Saudi Arabia owns the other 25 percent.
The companies — Exxon, Texaco, Standard Oil of
California and Mobil — would get $1.5 billion for their
interests, the Monitor said in quoting highly reliable
sources.
Aramco pumps 7.1 million barrels of oil each day,
compared with 8.8 million before the Arab oil cutbacks.
Gas Plan Not Complete Sueeess
Odd-even rationing plans cut some gasoline waiting lines
yesterday, but the programs were far from a complete
success. Service station operators complained that they
didn't want the burden of enforcing the largely voluntary
programs.
The White House said yesterday that President Nixon
will assess the effects of various state allocation plans
before recommending any change in federal gas rationing
policy.
Federal energy chief William E. Simon has said
previously that rationing, if imposed, will not go into effect
before March. Meanwhile, he asked motorists to limit
themselves voluntarily to 10 gallons per week.
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon was
well aware of the long lines at gasoline stations in some
areas.
Warren added, however; "The President will not say to a
governor, you should or should not do this or that. . . The
President favors voluntary actions, doing what each state
believes is necessary."
The press side said Oregon —wherea voluntary rationing
program was instituted Jan. 14 — was a "good example of a

The regulation also prohibits new arrangements
involving volume sales by retailers, said Greg Crosby, IRS
public affairs officer.
For example, he said, it is illegal for a retailer to sign up
a customer to buy 1,000 gallons, $50 worth or a month's
requirements in advance.
Violating the regulation can bring a civil penalty of
$2,500 or a criminal penalty of $5,000 for each violation.
Crosby said the regulation does not apply to voluntary
rationing plans such as those being put into effect in Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz Counties or those being carried out in
Oregon and other states.
Crosby said that if a customer is unable to resolve the
matter after calling the regulation to the attention of the
service station, he should contact his local IRS office.
13-Nation Oil Panel To Meet A^ain
WASHINGTON — The 13-nation Washington energy
conference agreed yesterday night to adjourn its session
until today in order to work on a compromise communique
that will outline the next step to be taken toward meeting
the energy crisis.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told newsmen "We
are coming back tomorrow, and we will be meeting during
the night to work on the communique."
An American draft is being examined by representatives
of all 13 nations in an effort to win an agreement with all
of the participating nations, particularly France.
Earlier France had balked at the American communique,
which spoke of setting up a committee to prepare for later
meetings to include less developed countries as well as
petroleum producing countries.
A proposal to use the petroleum committee of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
was turned down by the French. The U.S. also was cool to
this proposal, which was understood to have come from
Italian and British sources.
Kissinger and French Foreign Minister Michel Jobert met
during the afternoon in an effort to reach agreement.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow. Slightly warmer
days. Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today in the 50s and
tomorrow in the mid 50s to mid 60s. West to northwest
winds 10 to 20 mph.
Arabs To I) iseuss Mideast li«ilitin«i
Arab nations will hold a summit today in Algeria to
discuss disengagement of the Syrian and Israeli armies, the
Algerian Embassy in Paris and official sources in Cairo said
yesterday.
Middle East diplomats consider Syrian-Israeli military
disengagement a necessary step before there can be any
Arab-Israeli peace talks on territorial issues or a
modification of the oil embargo on the United States.
The official Algerian news agency said the participants in
the Algiers disengagement talks will include Syria and
Egypt, the principal combatants against Israeli in last
October's war. Egyptian and Israeli armies are being
separated on the Suez Canal front.
Other countries represented at the Algiers conference
will be Algeria and Saudi Arabia, the news agency said. The
head of state of Kuwait also might attend, said a spokesman
for the Algerian Embassy in Paris.
Iraq, one of the most vociferous Arab opponents of U.S.
Middle East policies since the Arab-Israeli war last October,
will boycott the Arab oil meeting on Thursday, Baghdad
radio said.
"Iraq will not take part in the Tripoli conference
because it is designed exclusively for discussing the
possibility of lifting the anti-U.S. embargos," the broadcast
said.
Arab oil ministers gather in Tripoli tomorrow.
Libya Nationalizes U.S. Oil Holdings
President Moammar Khadafy of Libya ordered 51
percent takeover of all foreign oil holdings in his country
last September. On Monday the government nationalized
the other 49 percent of the California Asiatic Co., owned
by Standard Oil of California; the American Overseas
Petroleum Co., owned by California Asiatic and Texaco;
and the Libyan-American Oil Co., owned by Atlantic
Richfield.
The nationalized properties produced only 124,000
barrels of crude oil a day, or about 5 percent of Libya's
total daily production.
The other American companies operating in Libya are
Mobil, which produces 120,000 barrels a day; Oasis, jointly
operated by Continental, Marathon Amerada Hess and
Royal Dutch Shell, and producing 700,000 barrels daily;
Occidental Petroleum, 370,000 barrels a day; Amoco —
Standard Oil of Indiana — whose daily production of 6,000
barrels was suspended by the Arab oil embargo because it
went to the United States.
The Christian Science Monitor reported that Saudi
Arabia will soon demand that four American companies
give up their 75 percent of the Arabian American Oil Co.
Saudi Arabia owns the other 25 percent.
The companies — Exxon, Texaco, Standard Oil of
California and Mobil — would get $1.5 billion for their
interests, the Monitor said in quoting highly reliable
sources.
Aramco pumps 7.1 million barrels of oil each day,
compared with 8.8 million before the Arab oil cutbacks.
Gas Plan Not Complete Sueeess
Odd-even rationing plans cut some gasoline waiting lines
yesterday, but the programs were far from a complete
success. Service station operators complained that they
didn't want the burden of enforcing the largely voluntary
programs.
The White House said yesterday that President Nixon
will assess the effects of various state allocation plans
before recommending any change in federal gas rationing
policy.
Federal energy chief William E. Simon has said
previously that rationing, if imposed, will not go into effect
before March. Meanwhile, he asked motorists to limit
themselves voluntarily to 10 gallons per week.
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon was
well aware of the long lines at gasoline stations in some
areas.
Warren added, however; "The President will not say to a
governor, you should or should not do this or that. . . The
President favors voluntary actions, doing what each state
believes is necessary."
The press side said Oregon —wherea voluntary rationing
program was instituted Jan. 14 — was a "good example of a
state where a form of gas rationing has improved the
situation."

Reineeke Loeated After Seeret Trip
SACRAMENTO — With the cloud of the ITT scandal
hanging over his head, Lt. Gov. Ed Reineeke was located
yesterday registered at a Washington, D.C. hotel after
leaving California secretively.
A Reineeke aide refused comment on whether the
lieutenant governor's trip was connected to a current
Watergate grand jury probe of the International Telephone
and Telegraph Corp. antitrust case.
The aide press secretary Earl Parker, replied "no
comment" to almost all questions, saying only: "He's on
personal business. I'm just following lieutenant governor's
instructions."
Shortly before his unexplained disappearance from the
California capitol Monday, Reineeke said in a series of
interviews he intends to clear his name in the ITT case
before launching his campaign for the Republican
nomination for governor.
"I have done absolutely nothing wrong. There was no
perjury," Reineeke said.
Reineeke made a similar unexplained trip to Washington
last week. He refused after that trip to discuss the nature of
his business there. He would neither confirm nor deny
whether he appeared before the grand jury or conferred
with the Watergate prosecutor on that trip.
Originally Reineeke was scheduled to spend Monday
kicking off his gubernatorial campaign with press
conferences around the state. He has led voter preference
polls for the nomination among Republican voters, but has
lost key supporters in recent weeks to state Controller
Houston Flournoy, the only other major GOP contender.
Gas Dealer Favoritism Ruled Illegal
SAN FRANCISCO - Gasoline and diesel fuel dealers may
not change their normal business practice to sell fuel only
to regular customers, the Internal Revenue Service said
yesterday.
The Federal Energy Office in Washington issued a
regulation yesterday under which petroleum suppliers
including ratailers may not discriminate among purchasers
of allocated petroleum products.
The regulation also prohibits new arrangements
involving volume sales by retailers, said Greg Crosby, IRS
public affairs officer.
For example, he said, it is illegal for a retailer to sign up
a customer to buy 1,000 gallons, $50 worth or a month's
