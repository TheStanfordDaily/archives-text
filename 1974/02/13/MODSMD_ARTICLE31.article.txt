# Kenyan Native Mazrui Explores 'Eurocentrism' Of World Culture
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
"Reason is Greek — 'I think,
therefore I am.' Emotion is black — 'I
feel, therefore I am.' "
Dr. Ali Mazrui, a Kenyan native and
a visiting research fellow at the Hoover
Institute, used this analogy last night
in describing "World Culture and the
Black Experience" to an audience of
approximately 125 in the Tresidder
lounge.
In speaking of the "overwhelmingly
Eurocentric" orientation of world
values, morals, religious beliefs and
technology, he accused western
culture of adopting the mystique of
ancient Greece as a part of its own
heritage.
"It consolidates the arrogance of
Europe," he said.
Scientific Margins
Mazrui discussed the place of blacks
on the margins of scientific advances,
rather than at their forefronts, and
cited the fact that blacks have only
won the Nobel Peace Prize — not the
awards for advances in science and
technology.
In trying to explain this "scientific
marginality," one group rebels against
it by pointing out the blacks who have
made technological contributions.
On the other hand, another group
accepts the thesis saying, " 'so
what?' " and points out the value and
beauty of a non-technical orientation.
'Mother Of Inertia'
Black scientific marginality may
also be due to the "kindness of
nature" Mazrui said. "If necessity is
the mother of invention, abundance is
the mother of inertia," he said.
Mazrui also pointed to the spatial
isolation of Africa, and its temporal
isolation due to the lack of a written
record preserving the blacks' progress
made in each generation on
intellectual and technical fronts.
"If Karl Marx had only been
speaking, |if| there had been no Das
Kapital or Mein Kampf, the chances
that his ideas would still be around in
the middle of the 20th Century are

not very groat," Mazrui said.
He cited the different case of the
Jewish people who, although also a
persecuted race, have had an
"intellectual edge" as opposed to the
Blacks' "scientific marginality."
Influential Men
Naming those who he feels most
people would agree have been the five
most influential men in forming the
present western mind — Newton,
Marx, Freud, Darwin and Einstein —
Mazrui pointed out that three of them
are Jewish — a highly disproportionate
number.
"Blacks must grasp the
Eurocentrism of world culture, and do
something to restore the balance in the
destiny of human heritage," he said.
When questioned after his speech as
to how he felt this could be done,
Mazrui mentioned the need for the
third world (Africa, Asia and Latin

America) to operate independently of
the western intellectual tradition.
Marxism
He feels the tendency to adopt
Marxism in rebellion to this tradition
is not viable because Marxism is a
western concept.
He also proposed penetration into
the dominant culture such as has been
shown in the current oil shortage.
"Before the shortage it was thought
that small countries had to be
economically developed to be
economically powerful. The crisis is
redefining the concept of economic
power," he said.
Mazrui was a fellow at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences last year. He will return to
Africa in March for four months
before assuming a permanent position
at the University of Michigan. His
speech was part of the Tuesday
evening lecture series.
