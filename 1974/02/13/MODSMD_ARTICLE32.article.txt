# Dealers Requested To Fill Only Fireproof Gas Cans
## 
### 
Stanford and Palo Alto Fire
Department officials have asked local
gas station owners to fill only gasoline
cans which are metal and vapor-tight.
In a letter to local gas station
owners, Palo Alto Asst. Fire Chief
James H. McLaughlin said, "We find
because of the pressures of the energy
crisis service stations are selling
gasoline products in portable
containers not approved for storage of
flammable liquids. We ask [gas station
owners] to dispense gasoline only into
fuel tanks or metal cans having a tight
closure."
"Non-vapor-tight gasoline cans have
caused five fires in Santa Clara County
during the past two weeks," said
Stanford Fire Marshal Patrick Cady.
"Fortunately, we've had no reports of

such fires on campus."
In automobiles, Cady said, the
vapors can filter through the trunk
into the interior where a match flame
or an electrical system spark can touch
off a "powerful explosion."
Only metal or specially approved
cans that are vapor-tight provide fire
safety when carried on the road. Cans
should not be filled completely
because the gasoline will expand.
Palo Alto fire codes restrict gasoline
cans to a six gallon limit.
California fire codes restrict the
storage of gasoline to one gallon at
private dwellings and forbid its storage
in apartments and dormitories.
Appliance pilot lights, such as water
heaters and light switches often ignite
the volatile, heavier-than-air gasoline
vapors, Cady said.
