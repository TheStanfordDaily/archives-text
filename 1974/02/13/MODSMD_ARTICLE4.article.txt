# Solzhenitsyn Arrested; Slander Trial Possible
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
MOSCOW — Soviet police muscled
into a Moscow apartment yesterday
and arrested Nobel Prize author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the dissident
writer's wife reported.
She said that Solzhenitsyn was
confronted by seven "rough" men just
inside the door of her apartment. A
counselor from the state prosecutor's
office named Sverev showed a
document authorizing use of force to
take him into custody, she added.
"I won't go," she said Solzhenitsyn
told them. "I have explained why. I
won't go unless you take me by
force."
The mother of Natalya Svetlova,
the novelist's wife, said the police then
dragged him off. Mrs. Solzhenitsyn
said the prosecutor's office advised her
four hours later that Solzhenitsyn was
under arrest.
Since publication in the West of his

new book on the Soviet labor camp
system, Gulag Archipelago,
Solzhenitsyn has been attacked in the
press, criticized on radio and television
and caricatured in posters as an
enemy of "everything the Soviet
Union holds dear."
The published work deals with
Soviet labor camps from 1918 to
1956, but a few pages in the final
section deal with the period up to
1968 when he finished writing the
entire work.
Solzhenitsyn has twice refused to
honor summonses to appear for
questioning. "I refuse to acknowledge
the legality of your summons and will
not come for an interrogation to any
state organ," he said in a statement
Monday.
Yesterday's action could be the
first step toward a trial for
"anti-Soviet slander." Or he could be
released soon in hopes his detention

would serve as a warning to stop
making statements to Western
newsmen.
The maximum sentence for
anti-Soviet slander is seven years in a
labor camp and five additional years in
Siberian exile. If he is to be tried, the
author could be held for investigation
for up to nine months.
A labor camp victim under Stalin,
later rehabilitated, Solzhenitsyn based
his latest book on his own experience
and conversations with fellow inmates
in the Stalinist camps.
Solzhenitsyn, rated in the West as
Russia's greatest living writer, has been
expelled from the Soviet Writers'
Union on grounds that he presents a
gloomy, critical picture of Soviet life.
He has been denied all the normal
writer's privileges, including a
residence permit for Moscow. But his
wife has her apartment there and he
usually stays with her.
Only one of his novels has been
published in the Soviet Union, One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.
And that appeared only in a magazine
and is no longer available. His later
works, Cancer Ward, The First Circle
and August 1914, were acclaimed in
the West but never published at home.
In a statement prepared in case of
his arrest, Solzhenitzyn said that if he
was sent to a labor camp he would give
his captors only one choice: "to kill
me quickly."
His statement continued that if a
Soviet court sentences him to another
labor camp team, he "will not work
one half-hour for my oppressors. In
this way I leave them the sole
responsibility of being caught out in
the open: to kill me quickly because I
have written the truth about Russian
history."
The statement, believed to be
Solzhenitsyn's last before his arrest,
included a promise to refuse to
cooperate in any way with his captors,
judges and jailers.
The 1970 Nobel laureate stated:
"In advance I declare that any tribunal
of common law on Russian literature
or any of its books, on any Russian
author, to be incompetent.
"If any such tribunal is called
against me, I shall not go there on my
own legs. I shall be taken there with
my hands bound in a police van."

won't go unless you take me by
force."
The mother of Natalya Svetlova,
the novelist's wife, said the police then
dragged him off. Mrs. Solzhenitsyn
said the prosecutor's office advised her
four hours later that Solzhenitsyn was
under arrest.
Since publication in the West of his

new book on the Soviet labor camp
system, Gulag Archipelago,
Solzhenitsyn has been attacked in the
press, criticized on radio and television
and caricatured in posters as an
enemy of "everything the Soviet
Union holds dear."
The published work deals with
Soviet labor camps from 1918 to
1956, but a few pages in the final
section deal with the period up to
1968 when he finished writing the
entire work.
Solzhenitsyn has twice refused to
honor summonses to appear for
questioning. "I refuse to acknowledge
the legality of your summons and will
not come for an interrogation to any
state organ," he said in a statement
Monday.
Yesterday's action could be the
first step toward a trial for
"anti-Soviet slander." Or he could be
released soon in hopes his detention

would serve as a warning to stop
making statements to Western
newsmen.
The maximum sentence for
anti-Soviet slander is seven years in a
labor camp and five additional years in
Siberian exile. If he is to be tried, the
author could be held for investigation
for up to nine months.
A labor camp victim under Stalin,
later rehabilitated, Solzhenitsyn based
his latest book on his own experience
and conversations with fellow inmates
in the Stalinist camps.
Solzhenitsyn, rated in the West as
Russia's greatest living writer, has been
expelled from the Soviet Writers'
Union on grounds that he presents a
gloomy, critical picture of Soviet life.
He has been denied all the normal
writer's privileges, including a
residence permit for Moscow. But his
wife has her apartment there and he
usually stays with her.
Only one of his novels has been
published in the Soviet Union, One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.
And that appeared only in a magazine
and is no longer available. His later
works, Cancer Ward, The First Circle
and August 1914, were acclaimed in
the West but never published at home.
In a statement prepared in case of
his arrest, Solzhenitzyn said that if he
was sent to a labor camp he would give
his captors only one choice: "to kill
me quickly."
His statement continued that if a
Soviet court sentences him to another
labor camp team, he "will not work
one half-hour for my oppressors. In
this way I leave them the sole
responsibility of being caught out in
the open: to kill me quickly because I
have written the truth about Russian
history."
The statement, believed to be
Solzhenitsyn's last before his arrest,
included a promise to refuse to
cooperate in any way with his captors,
judges and jailers.
The 1970 Nobel laureate stated:
"In advance I declare that any tribunal
of common law on Russian literature
or any of its books, on any Russian
author, to be incompetent.
"If any such tribunal is called
against me, I shall not go there on my
own legs. I shall be taken there with
my hands bound in a police van."
