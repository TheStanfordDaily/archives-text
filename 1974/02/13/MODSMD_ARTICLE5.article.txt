# Hearst Kidnapers Demand Food For Poor As Negotiation Step

From The Associated Press
BERKELEY, Calif. - The
kidnapers of heiress Patricia Hearst
demanded millions of dollars in free
food yesterday for California's needy
as the first step in negotiating the girl's
freedom. They threatened to kill the
coed if her family didn't comply.
The demand was accompanied by
an 11-minute tape recorded message
from Miss Hearst, who urged her
parents to meet the kidnapers'
conditions quickly. Her father,
newspaper magnate Randolph A.
Hearst, said he would do his best.
"Mom and Dad, I'm okay," said the
soft, strained voice of Miss Hearst.
"I'm not being starved or beaten or
unnecessarily frightened ... I can't
identify anyone. Mv hands are often
tied "
Hearst said he took the recording as

proof his 19-year-old daughter was
safe and would try to comply with the
demands. "I believe these people are
sincere," he said.
"We'll do everything we can in our
power to get Patty back," he added.
"Certainly we'll try to make every
gesture of good faith to these people
so that they know we're taking them
seriously."
SLA Claim
The Symbionese Liberation Army,
which claims responsibility for the
kidnaping on Feb. 4, said it "arrested"
Miss Hearst for "crimes her mother
and father have committed against the
American people and the people of the
world."
"Whatever happens to your
daughter is totally your responsibility
and the responsibility of the
authorities you represent. If she is

harmed ... the life and b'ood of that
would be upon your hands only,"
warned a tape recording to Berkeley
radio station KPFA. An eight-page
letter was enclosed.
The kidnapers broke a five-day
silence to demand that the Hearst
family distribute $70 worth of
high-quality meat, vegetables and fruit
to welfare recipients, the aged, the
disabled, persons on probation or
parole and those receiving food
stamps.
Price Estimate
Based on estimates of 1.9 million
persons on welfare and 200,000 on
probation in California, the food bill
would run at least $147 million.
"When this good faith gesture is
conducted and we have means to
ascertain if they are ... we will begin
negotiating for the release of your
daughter," the kidnapers said in the
tape recording.
"If this is not done, we will assume
there is no basis for negotiation and
we will no longer maintain in good
health the prisoner of war," they
warned.
The terrorist group demanded that
the food be delivered over a four-week
period starting Feb. 19 at publicized
supermarkets in San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Oakland, Delano, Compton,
Santa Rosa, Richmond and other
cities.
In the recorded message, which
Miss Hearst said she taped last Friday,
the girl urged her family to try to
begin the food distribution earlier.
In the tape sent to KPFA, a man
who identified himself as a black said
he was "quite willing to carry out
execution of your daughter to save the
starving and exploitations of
thousands of men and women of all
races."
The voice on yesterday's recording
said: "It's really up to you to make
sure those people can't jeopardize my
life by charging in and doing stupid
things. I'm not being tried for crimes
I'm not responsible for. I'm here
because I'm a member of a ruling class
family."
