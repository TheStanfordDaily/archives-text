# Senate Plans To Solicit More Student Feedback
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate has recently
started a program to increase
communication between students and
senators.
The plan, designed by Senate
Chairman Reggie Turner, makes each
of the 20 senators responsible for
distributing information to a certain
district of the campus and trying to
"stimulate interest in the Senate." In
the center of his district, each senator
will post his name, phone number and
times when he can be reached to talk
with interested students.
Turner pointed to the Senate's need
for a "greater sentiment of our
constituency" as purpose of the plan.
Both Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and many senators have
admitted there is a lack of contact
between students and the Senate.
According to Sen. Maria Echaveste,
the Senate has not been representative
of the students because students don't
know what the Senate is doing. Daily

articles and word-of-mouth messages
are the only means that students have
to find out what the Senate is doing
and sometimes these methods are
insufficient, Echaveste said. In the
past, she explained, students didn't
even know how to contact Senate
members.
"At least people will read the
summaries of meetings," Echaveste
said. She added that she hoped
students would take time to talk.
Last years' senate chairman Rocky
Barber, said he saw the plan as helpful
in getting the Senate to use what
power it has â€” publicizing and
promoting discussion of issues with
letters, open meetings, forums and
referendums.
The effectiveness of the plan
depends upon whether or not senators
can be "reactive to students," Barber
said. If the Senate isn't reactive to
students, then it becomes like a group
of "just any twenty students," Barber
said.
