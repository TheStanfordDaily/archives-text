## Art Donation 
### 
Congratulations and thanks are definitely in order
following the announcement Monday that the University is
receiving a major gift of Rodin works, memorabilia and
reference material.
The donation — 88 works plus other material from the
collection of Beverly Hills investment banker B. Gerald
Cantor — has been valued into the millions of dollars. But in
point of fact the gift is priceless: it is the value of art.
The donation, declared Art Prof. Albert Elsen, "shows
Mr. Cantor's confidence in what a university art museum can
do with such an impressive quantity of works, and gives
Stanford students a chance to show what they can
accomplish given the art and funding." To this we can only
add our agreement: the gift will be not only a rewarding
experience for the thousands who will view it; it should also
prove rewarding to those who help prepare it to be viewed.
The gift is to be housed in the newly renamed B.G.
Cantor Gallery of the Stanford Museum. While we
appreciate the tremendous amount of time and effort in
preparing the donation for exhibition, we would hope that
the collection could go on display as soon as is practically
possible so that the public can appreciate the genius of
Rodin.
We offer our thanks and our congratulations: to Cantor,
through whose generosity and — we think — excellent
judgment the University received this gift; to Prof. Elsen,
who has labored long and hard to arrange the donation; and
to the many others who helped arrange the donation. They
have given the University and the community a valuable gift,
one that we hope will be appreciated in perpetuity.
