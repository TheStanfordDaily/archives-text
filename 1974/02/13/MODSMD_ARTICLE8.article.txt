# Soviet Dissidents
##

David Szonyi

In an age of political and moral
pygmies, Alexander Solzhenitsyn
and Andrei Sakharov stand out as
the age's giants. No one can read
Solzhenitsyn's early works
without appreciating creative
genius and irrepressible moral
courage. Now, in The Gulag
Archipelego, three long excerpts
of which recently appeared in the
New York Times, Solzhenitsyn
has crossed the line between
fiction and fact. With prophetic
force and boldness, Solzhenitsyn
has documented how ruthlessly
and thoroughly both Lenin and
Stalin betrayed the revolution.
While it would certainly be
easier, both for the Nobel Prize
winner* and for the Soviet
authorities who continue to harass
him, for Solzhenitsyn to practice
that "silence, exile, and cunning"
prescribed by James Joyce for
dissident writers, Solzhenitsyn has
taken the considerably more
dangerous and difficult path of
inner exile. His current position
and importance were aptly
depicted by a cartoon in a
Norwegian paper, reprinted in the
Berliner Zeitung. In it,
Solzhenitsyn is depicted as
Gulliver, almost tied down by
Brezhnev and his fellow
Lilliputians. But as the giant's arm
remains free and wields an
enormous pen, the caption reads,
"Beware, he can still write."
Andrei Sakharov's brilliant and
moving manifesto on "Progress
and Peaceful Co-Existence" was
printed in the New York Times
find elsewhere only weeks before
the 1968 Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia. Again and again,
Sakharov has endangered his
position and prestige by calling
for greater freedom of expression
within the USSR, as well as
defending numerous Soviet
dissidents, including Solzhenitsyn
— this at a time when all major
Soviet cultural and scientific
figures are under extreme pressure
to abandon and denounce the
dissidents for their "anti-Soviet
behavior."
Writer Lauds Friend
In his extraordinary interview
with correspondents from AP and
Le Monde, published in the Oct.
4, 1973, New York Review of
Books, Solzhenitsyn himself
payed this tribute to his physicist
friend: "In Sakharov's behavior
there lies a deep meaning, a lofty
symbol, and the logic of a
personal destiny: the inventor of
the most powerful destructive
weapon of the century [ the
hydrogen bomb] submitting

himself, under the weight of sins
which are common to us all, to
the force of universal conscience
and Russian conscience,
abandoning the superfluous
comforts guaranteed him —
comforts that are a moral loss to
so many others — in order to
throw himself into the jaws of
all-powerful violence."
What has all this to do with us?
I suggest that Solzhenitsyn and
Sakharov are far more than
leading Soviet dissidents; they are
"men for all seasons" and all
places, men who represent that
rare but ineradicable strength in
the human spirit which can
withstand oppression and scorn,
ostracism and torture. They are
men who, through both words
and deeds, insist that we remain
human, something that should be
obvious and could hardly be more
difficult in this self-consuming
century of Verdun and Guernica,
Auschwitz and Hiroshima, My Lai
and Bengla Desh.
Deserve Honor
If we are neither articulate nor
courageous enough to emulate
that "inflexibility of the spirit"
shown by Solzhenitsyns and
Sakharovs, at least we can honor
those who are. In showing our
solidarity with men like
Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov, we
also make it so much more
difficult for the Soviet authorities
to further threaten, harass, and
imprison them. In this regard, I
strongly suggest:
(1) the student body, Faculty
Senate, and Board of Trustees —
preferably all three acting
separately — vote for Solzhenitsyn
and Sakharov the award of
"Uncommon Man" (since the
University does not award
honorary degrees).
(2) Stanford, through whatever
contacts it has in Moscow, offer
Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov full
faculty positions at Stanford (as,
for example, Michigan did with
the expelled Soviet-Jewish poet
Josef Brodsky) in the event either
or both is expelled from or
pressured to leave the USSR.
More Than Symbolic
Granted both of these actions
would be small and, to a large
extent, symbolic, I am convinced
they would be more than just
that. They might begin to shake
us out of our pervasive and
crushing political passivity while
eventually being heard in both
Washington and Moscow.
