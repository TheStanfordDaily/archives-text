# Could Book Be SLA Influence?

### BILL EVERS News Analysis 
"Oakland blew first, then Los
Angeles, then, leapfrogging the
continent, Harlem and South
Philadelphia." This is the opening
sentence of the last chapter of Sam
Greenlee's The Spook Who Sat by the
Door, a 1969 novel of urban guerrilla
warfare and a book that prominent
radicals in San Francisco and Berkeley
are convinced has influenced the
thinking of the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA).
Two immediate indications of the
influence of the book on the SLA are
thought to be the use of the word
"symbiology" in the phrase "an ethnic
and racial cross-section symbiology"
on page two of the novel, and the fact
that the name of the guerrilla group in
the novel is the Cobras and the symbol
of the SLA is a multi-headed cobra.
At this point, some differences are
apparent, most especially the fact that
the fictional Cobras are black
nationalists whereas the SLA is
multi-racial. However, it is interesting
to note that the word "symbiosis" is
incorporated, according to the SLA's
communiques, into the SLA's name in
order to indicate the group's
multi-racial character. This is an
unusual use of the word "symbiosis"
— yet iL is a usage found in Greenlee's
novel.
There has been much speculation in
the news media about the effect of the
examples of the Palestinian guerrillas
and of the Tupamaros, a Uruguayan
urban guerrilla group, on the SLA.
Mention has also been made of the
urban guerrilla tactics shown in the
films Battle of Algiers and State of
Siege. It appears that Greenlee's novel
should also be considered a possible
influence. One political activist
involved in current news reporting of
the Hearst kidnaping told the Daily
that he considers the novel to be
"quite close to the SLA's thinking."
Other radicals speculated along
similar lines, arguing that the SLA may
be a group of Vietnam war veterans,
possibly including former intelligence
officers. Dan Freeman, the hero of
The Spook Who Sat by the Door is a
black nationalist revolutionary who is
trained by an unwitting CIA and who
then uses his training to organize
urban uprisings.
In the novel, Freeman says,
"There's a certain poetry in whitey
training us to mess with him. Every
black cat in Vietnam is a potential
asset for our thing."
Speculation among Bay Area
radicals pictures the SLA as
battle-fatigued veterans, who are
accustomed to weapons and military
combat and thus turn readily to the
use of isolated acts of guerrilla
warfare.
One radical saw a bizarre irony in
the assassination of Oakland School
Superintendent Marcus Foster and the
kidnaping of Patricia Hearst: "It's the
old SDS slogan 'Bring the War Home'
happening in a very real way." She
went on to condemn the SLA as
politically counter-productive.
The plot of The Spook Who Sat by
the Door centers on the preparations
for an urban insurrection. The hero of
the novel has a token position in the
newly-integrated CIA, but he uses the
ClA's expertise in counter-insurgency
to train himself as a future insurgent.
At the book's end, there are
uprisings in eight cities, some put into
motion by organizers sent out months
before from Chicago.
