# Student Power' Is Not A Cliche

The Row Housing issue has raised a
number of questions aside from itself, and
perhaps the most salient one concerns
student participation in University
administration. It concerns our ASSU
student government, the student body we
call the Association, and the power-play
within the Stanford Community.
"Student Power" may sound like a cliche,
but the idea expressed by this hackneyed
phrase is very real indeed — and something
very needed within the Stanford Community.
Recent events have shown the voice of
students is not being heard. Robert
Augsburger, Edward Shaw, and Robert
Summers, while representing the
administration in the Jan. 31 meeting on the
Emeritus Housing Project, admitted real
student input had been slighted in the
project's planning.
Though these men deemed their decision
irreversible, they were at least considerate
enough to apologize for the ineptness of it
all. On Feb. 8, Dr. Lyman termed 2400
student votes as being of little consequence
and "irresponsible." With a good deal of
temerity, he also ordered that an "objective"
review be done by the original planners.
ASSU Officials Scapegoats
Students have talked often about the
powerlessness of the ASSU and consequently
the powerlessness of the Stanford Student
Body. Many have even gone so far during
times of crises to use ASSU officials as

scapegoats — depicting ineptness, egoism, and
hypocrisy. Rarely does anyone discuss why
this powerlessness exists or what could be
gained from a strong student government.
Anyone who has worked inside the ASSU
knows the true situation. From my freshman
year to the present, I've worked with three
successive ASSU administrations. There can
be little denying that general student apathy
is the real culprit. We have the machinery for
student influence.
We have a profile for governance with a
President, a Senate, an allowance for students
on the various University Committees and we
even have really dedicated student leaders
like Jim Friend, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Kevin O'Grady — not to
mention this year's 20 Senators who are by
far the most seriously dedicated this
University has yet to see.
'Who Cares?' Attitude Strong
The "who cares?" attitude is strong
within the Stanford Student Body and it's
mostly attributable to the unique make-up of
this body. Stanford has graduate students
who look upon the ASSU as an
undergraduate affair. And Stanford has
undergraduate "red-hots" in Pre-Med,
Engineering, Pre-Law, Psychology, Math,
etc., who lack the time for peripheral
concerns such as those of the ASSU.
Quarter after quarter, year after year, the
ASSU is run and cared for mostly by
Economics and Political Science majors who

see some relevance in participation. But for
the students in the ASSU there is a crucial
difference. The ASSU can't operate without
complete student support.
No student will ever hear President Lyman
or any administration official calling for
"Student Power" or more interest in student
civic affairs because this would entail an
incredible conflict of interests. To the
administration things are well as things are.
No, the very difficult job of uniting the
disjointed body of students on this campus is
left to the ASSU.
Friend Did All He Could
On the Row Issue, Jim Friend did all that
he or any student could do to see that
student interests were, for once, considered
in a real sense and not just listened to and
disregarded in the many "meetings."
JimWascher's article "Friend: Too Little,
Too Late" saw things from the wrong
perspective. It's my opinion that Friend's
intent was merely to stir interest and raise
student consciousness with regard to
"student input and the Stanford
decision-making process." Row was just
where he and the Council-of-Presidents
decided to have the showdown. That is, they
were trying to revive "Student Power," and
they may yet succeed; but it is extremely
disheartening to see a student cut to ribbons
for doing the job he was elected to do.
