# No Conspiracy To Limit Physicians

Bruce Smyth's somewhat provocative
article on medical education (Daily, Feb. 7)
leaves the reader with the uneasy feeling that
dark forces, including the American Medical
Association, are conspiring to limit the
supply of practicing physicians. This could be
true, but I don't think that his argument is in
any way supportive. From the practicing
physician's point of view, I would like to set
the record straight on a number of issues
which he has raised.
First of all, The American Medical
Association, whatever its shortcomings, does
not regulate admissions to medical schools: it
does set standards for medical education and
licensure in this country.
Thoughtful critics of American medicine
have largelv abandoned the idea of an
absolute doctor shortage. The problem has to
do with an uneven geographical distribution
and the segregation of many physicians in
institutional medicine: teaching and research.
Practicing Physicians Denigrated
Although young people are being
attracted to medical careers in increasing
numbers, for many of them interest lies in

the field of human biology rather than
patient care. The situation is aggravated in
part by the unhappy propensity of medical
school faculties to denigrate the role of
the practicing physician. Instead of the
medical student finding a model worthy of
emulation among community physicians, he
graduates from medical school with the view
that most practicing physicians are rather
inept.
Mr. Smyth seems to have ignored the real
thrust of the Flexner report which was an
indictment of medical education in America
prior to 1910: medical schools varied from
the excellent to the dismally inadequate, and
curricula varied from an orderly sequence of
basic science and clinical instruction to a year
or so of correspondence courses.
The closing of a number of medical
schools following this report was as much a
reflection of public indignation as it was an
incursion of the AMA's council on medical
education into unfamiliar territory. In short,
the schools which were closed had previously
operated as "diploma mills."
I believe Mr. Smyth's Cadillac-high

priced physician analogy violates some
principles of elementary logic, and really
adds nothing to his arguemnt favoring the
relaxation of standards for admission to
medical school and the creation of "second
class" medical schools.
Sober Inquiry Needed
If in fact there is a crisis in American
medicine, with too few physicians for too
many patients, what is needed is sober
inquiry into the problem which takes into
consideration the role of medical schools in
fostering the idea of community service for
physicians, and which explores the possibility
of utilizing paramedical substitutes in areas
which are deprived of physicians.
There is little to be gained in the public
interest with endless polemics concerning
organized medicine. Although the AMA has
hardly been the vanguard of progressive ideas
in the distribution of health care, it has had a
salutory effect on the direction and quality
of medical education.
