W.I.S.E. Lounge Problems
Editor:
Last year the School of
Engineering went to considerable
expense to furnish and equip a
very nice lounge in the Durand
Building for W.I.S.E. (Women in
Science and Engineering) which
was greatly appreciated by us all.
Although we could lock the room
and exclude everyone but
members, we have made it
available to both men and women
except for times when the women
have scheduled meetings.
Until a few months ago this
seemed to work out reasonably
well, excluding incidents of two
classes outside the Engineering
School commandeering it for
regularly scheduled classes and
overnight residents who have to
be discouraged from time to time.

Now we have some students
who feel that it is their right to
use the lounge when and how
they please, leaving exploded eggs
iii the oven, the sink so clogged
with coffee grounds and food
particles that it took the plumbers
two weeks to unstop it, cigarette
ashes all over the floor and
furniture, not to mention bits and
pieces of food and paper bags.
The culmination of male pique
came, however, when the women
arrived the other day and
informed a student using the
phone that they were about to
have a meeting whereupon he
promptly ripped the phone apart!
Does anyone who exerts only
his rights and not his
responsibilities belong in a
university? A lot of people have
made sacrifices that we might
have an easier and pleasanter life
here. Is this the way to repay their

benevolence?

More on College Terrace
Editor:
I regret that my letter has been
viewed by Mr. James Culpepper as
disingenuous or as representative
of the University's position on the
College Terrace traffic issue.
Neither is the case. Having been a
resident of College Terrace prior
to being a Unviersity employee, I
find myself impeded by barricades
on both city and campus streets.
I have reached and expressed
independent judgments, some of
them contrary to the positions of
both the University and the

College Terrace Residents
Association.

Med Students 'Footnote'
Editor:
While reading the Feb. 11
article entitled, "Cadavers
Confront Med Students," I was
disappointed to find the negative
aspects of gross anatomy
emphasized and the positive
aspects ignored. On the contrary,
the study of this subject can be a
fascinating and rewarding
experience. Those who have the
opportunity to examine the
intricate workings of a human
hand or the delicate structure of a
human ear are fortunate indeed.
