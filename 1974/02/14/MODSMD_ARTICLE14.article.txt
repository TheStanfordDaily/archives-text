Asian American radio at
Stanford will begin airing over
KZSU this Friday at 7 p.m. We
feel it's long past due.
Stanford Asian Americans have
a special set of minority hurdles
to overcome to realize our
identity. Most of us come from
middle class families, with little
contact with other Asian
Americans from other areas and
income groups. Stanford is
basically a velvet white ghetto,
with little diversity in its student
body — consequently, again there
is little exposure with anything
but white culture. The deletion
of Asians in Stanford minority
admissions policy still further
restricts Asian Americans from
realizing their identity.
The deletion of Asian
Americans carries through into
the realm of academia. How many
Asian American courses are
offered here at Stanford? Very
few, if any at all. All you get are
gleanings from various Chinese or
Japanese history courses, or
anthropology, sociology, or
language courses. If an Asian
American wants to learn about his
past, or the movement in person,
where can he turn?
Gov. Stanford's Speech
For instance, do people know
the basic history of Chinese who
came to California to work on the
railroads — Leland Stanford's
railroads? How many people
know that in his 1862 Message to
the California Legislature, he said
of Asians:
To my mind it is clear that the
settlement among us of an
inferior race is to be
discouraged by every legitimate
means. Asia, with her
numberless millions, sends to
our shores the dregs of her
populations.... There can be
no doubt but that the presence
of number among us of a
degraded and distinct people
must exercise a deleterious
influence upon the superior
race, and to a certain extent
repel desireable immigration. It
will afford me great pleasure to
concur with the Legislature in
any constitutional action
having for its object the
repression of the immigration
of the Asiatic races.
How many people know that
Chinese were lynched in
California, Wyoming, and
Washington? How many people
know anything more than the
basic facts that Japanese
internment occurred in the United
States? Our American history
books seem to gloss through these
phases of American thinking.
Other Pictures
What else has been left out?
Or, within this white culture,
what remains as the image of
Asian Americans? What picture is
painted in the history books? In
the media? In our everyday
contact? How much of this
information is altered?
We will not find the answers to
these questions through the
classroom. The world is simply
not geared to the Asian American.
This radio program is.
We plan to present news,
features, commentaries, music,
and history concerning Asians in
America. With a blackout of Asian
American news through regular
channels, we may be the only link
to a heritage for many Stanford
Asian Americans.
Media Stereotypes
Our first program deals with
stereotypes of Asians in the
media. Perhaps after you hear it,
you may understand a little bit
better why some Asian Americans
responded heatedly to the recent
Daily article on Mr. Chang. Or
maybe you'll think twice about
Kung Fu's merits as an
"Asian-oriented" (sic) television
series.

We want Asian Americans and
other interested people to listen
to this program, and gain
solidarity through what we say, or
get a different perspective on
Asian Americans.
We call our program A Grain of
Sand, for Asian Americans are
grains of sand in a white ocean.
But we have the potential of
becoming special entities, pearls
within the ocean. We are unique.
We have to realize our uniqueness
and attain self dignity, not as
Chinese or Japanese or Koreans or
Filipinos; not as Americans — but
as Asian Americans. There is a
difference. We hope this new
radio program will make this
difference clearer.
