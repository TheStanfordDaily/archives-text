# Hand-Chiseled Walls To Highlight New Law School
## 
### SUZIE BOSS 
"Chip . . . chip ... chip chip" — the sound of progress.
Progress on Stanford's new law school building can be
measured in chips per hour. Before the Crown Quadrangle
Law School is completed, two full man-years of labor will
be invested chiseling the walls by hand.
The walls will be lined with vertical ridges spaced as
regularly as casebooks inside the law library. The textured
exterior is called "fractured exposed concrete."
To achieve the ridged effect, concrete is first poured
into molds with accordian-like folds. When set, the shaped
concrete slabs and attached molds are raised into place.
Then the molds must be chipped off by hand, according to
Bob McLean of the Carl Olson & Sons Construction Co.
working on the building. Workers on scaffolds will pound
off the molds with hammers and wedges to finish the
exterior surface.
Hand Textured
This will not be Stanford's first building to feature
hand-textured walls. Two ends of the nearby Education
Research and Development Center were constructed by
the same method.
Jim Atwood, superintendent for that job, calls the
manual labor involved "terribly hard. It's the continual
nature of it that makes it so bad." Asked if his men made

any comments about the work, he comments, "Oh, they
had things to say, all right. But I don't want to tell you
over the phone what they thought of it."
One of the men who worked on the job agreed with
Atwood that chipping "was awfully tiring work." He
remembers "feeling no frustrations at all by the end of a
day. I took them all out on the building."
The special surface is not just "a little added
gingerbread," however, according to John Leary,
Stanford's construction manager for Crown Quad. Before
the building was designed, normal costs were estimated for
each stage of the construction process. The architect was
presented with this "cost model" before he drew up his
plans for the building.
Overboard
If the architect wanted to go overboard in cost on one
step of construction, Leary says,"he was expected to find
the extra money in another." Leaving this cost-juggling up
to the architect "lets him be creative to his best ability,"
Leary says. "We select architects for their innovative
designs, but we also expect innovation in saving money on
other areas."
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill of San Francisco
designed both Crown Quad and the Education Center.
Tom Moultori, representative for the firm, explains how

the ridged surface pattern will be exaggerated in the law
school building.
"Not only the surface, but the building's walls
themselves are to be shaped into ridges, echoing the
exterior facade," he said. This design creates pointed bays
that jut out regularly, looking much like an egg carton
turned sideways.
Each bay will feature a window with a different vantage
point for viewing the campus. The architects seem bent on
bringing the law students to look at things from every
angle.
Interactive Bunch
The designers must have pictured Stanford
lawyers-to-be as an interactive bunch. "After any class
session," said Moulton, "discussion is often eagerly
pursued." An innovation in interior design will provide for
this carry-over. The large lecture halls will have smaller
adjoining rooms where further debate can be carried on.
Moulton calls these areas "postmortem rooms."
Along with its creative designs, the building has been
planned to blend well with the rest of the campus. It will
be thatched with the Old Mission style tile that marks
Stanford's architecture. John Leary stresses that the roof's
purpose is "not for more gingerbready touches. The red
roofs give the campus a certain character and charm."

CHISELED — The new Crown Quadrangle Law School will feature a
unique hand-chiseled exterior. Not only will the surface contain
ridges, but the design creates pointed bays chat jut out regularly,
looking much like an egg carton turned sideways. Over two-man years
of labor will be required to complete the outside work alone. Bad
weather and strikes have led to delays in construction.

Jim Atwood, superintendent for that job, calls the
manual labor involved "terribly hard. It's the continual
nature of it that makes it so bad." Asked if his men made

any comments about the work, he comments, "Oh, they
had things to say, all right. But I don't want to tell you
over the phone what they thought of it."
One of the men who worked on the job agreed with
Atwood that chipping "was awfully tiring work." He
remembers "feeling no frustrations at all by the end of a
day. I took them all out on the building."
The special surface is not just "a little added
gingerbread," however, according to John Leary,
Stanford's construction manager for Crown Quad. Before
the building was designed, normal costs were estimated for
each stage of the construction process. The architect was
presented with this "cost model" before he drew up his
plans for the building.
Overboard
If the architect wanted to go overboard in cost on one
step of construction, Leary says,"he was expected to find
the extra money in another." Leaving this cost-juggling up
to the architect "lets him be creative to his best ability,"
Leary says. "We select architects for their innovative
designs, but we also expect innovation in saving money on
other areas."
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill of San Francisco
designed both Crown Quad and the Education Center.
Tom Moultori, representative for the firm, explains how

the ridged surface pattern will be exaggerated in the law
school building.
"Not only the surface, but the building's walls
themselves are to be shaped into ridges, echoing the
exterior facade," he said. This design creates pointed bays
that jut out regularly, looking much like an egg carton
turned sideways.
Each bay will feature a window with a different vantage
point for viewing the campus. The architects seem bent on
bringing the law students to look at things from every
angle.
Interactive Bunch
The designers must have pictured Stanford
lawyers-to-be as an interactive bunch. "After any class
session," said Moulton, "discussion is often eagerly
pursued." An innovation in interior design will provide for
this carry-over. The large lecture halls will have smaller
adjoining rooms where further debate can be carried on.
Moulton calls these areas "postmortem rooms."
Along with its creative designs, the building has been
planned to blend well with the rest of the campus. It will
be thatched with the Old Mission style tile that marks
Stanford's architecture. John Leary stresses that the roof's
purpose is "not for more gingerbready touches. The red
roofs give the campus a certain character and charm."

CHISELED — The new Crown Quadrangle Law School will feature a
unique hand-chiseled exterior. Not only will the surface contain
ridges, but the design creates pointed bays chat jut out regularly,
looking much like an egg carton turned sideways. Over two-man years
of labor will be required to complete the outside work alone. Bad
weather and strikes have led to delays in construction.
"Chip . . . chip ... chip chip" — the sound of progress.
Progress on Stanford's new law school building can be
measured in chips per hour. Before the Crown Quadrangle
Law School is completed, two full man-years of labor will
be invested chiseling the walls by hand.
The walls will be lined with vertical ridges spaced as
regularly as casebooks inside the law library. The textured
exterior is called "fractured exposed concrete."
To achieve the ridged effect, concrete is first poured
into molds with accordian-like folds. When set, the shaped
concrete slabs and attached molds are raised into place.
Then the molds must be chipped off by hand, according to
Bob McLean of the Carl Olson & Sons Construction Co.
working on the building. Workers on scaffolds will pound
off the molds with hammers and wedges to finish the
exterior surface.
Hand Textured
This will not be Stanford's first building to feature
hand-textured walls. Two ends of the nearby Education
Research and Development Center were constructed by
the same method.
