# Plant Recycles Solid Waste In Clean, Efficient Process
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
A different and very ecological
way of recycling solid waste
which may soon become
widespread is now being
developed by the Combustion
Power Co., Inc. in Menlo Park.
In contrast to the more
well-known recycling methods in
which glass bottles, paper,
aluminum cans and bi-metal cans
must all be separated from each
other before being recycled,
Combustion Power's plant can
handle unsegregated garbage.
The solid waste is put through
a shredder, then "air classified" —
that is, a rising current of air
separates the paper products and
some of the plastics from the
heavier wastes. The paper-type
fragments are fed into a fluid bed
combuster. There they are
burned, releasing heat into the
fluid bed and into the air passing
through the fluid bed, thus
creating a hot gas. The hot gas is
cleaned up by inertial separaters
and expanded through a hot gas
turbine to create electrical power.
Waste Separation
Meanwhile, the heavy waste is
separated into its separate
components in a series of steps.
First, a magnet pulls out the steel;
then there is screening for sand,
ceramics and glass; next the

aluminum is pulled out by an
aluminum magnet; and finally the
non-ferous metals such as brass
and copper and any aluminum
that the aluminum magnet missed
are taken out. The left-over waste
is reprocessed.
The material that has been
separated is sold to the
appropriate industries and used to
make things like "rebar"
(reinforced concrete steel),
ceramic tiles and aluminum cans.
Combustion Power is under
contract to the Environmental
Protection Agency and is
primarily a research and
development company. The
company has been dealing with
the problem of solid waste for six
years, and put the recycling
equipment into operation three
years ago. $5 million has been
spent to date.
Pilot Plant
The plant in Menlo Park is only
a pilot plant with the capacity of
processing 100 tons of solid waste
per day. According to Sam
Eveleth, information officer for
the Combustion Power Company,
Combustion Power hopes to have
a full-sized plant in operation in
another year.
Such a plant would cover two
acres, and would require
approximately $7 million of

capital initially. The plant would
be capable of processing 400 tons
of solid waste a day — or enough
to take care of 160,000 people
(figuring five pounds of waste per
person per day).
The plant would also meet
one-tenth of the community's
electrical needs and show a profit
of 31 cents a ton. Because the
plants are fairly small, several
could be scattered through a large
community, thus cutting down on
the costs of transporting the solid
waste.
At the moment, three cities are
considering proposals to build
combustion power units: Grand
Rapids, Mich., Palo Alto and the
East Bay Utilities District.

A different and very ecological
way of recycling solid waste
which may soon become
widespread is now being
developed by the Combustion
Power Co., Inc. in Menlo Park.
In contrast to the more
well-known recycling methods in
which glass bottles, paper,
aluminum cans and bi-metal cans
must all be separated from each
other before being recycled,
Combustion Power's plant can
handle unsegregated garbage.
The solid waste is put through
a shredder, then "air classified" —
that is, a rising current of air
separates the paper products and
some of the plastics from the
heavier wastes. The paper-type
fragments are fed into a fluid bed
combuster. There they are
burned, releasing heat into the
fluid bed and into the air passing
through the fluid bed, thus
creating a hot gas. The hot gas is
cleaned up by inertial separaters
and expanded through a hot gas
turbine to create electrical power.
Waste Separation
Meanwhile, the heavy waste is
separated into its separate
components in a series of steps.
First, a magnet pulls out the steel;
then there is screening for sand,
ceramics and glass; next the

aluminum is pulled out by an
aluminum magnet; and finally the
non-ferous metals such as brass
and copper and any aluminum
that the aluminum magnet missed
are taken out. The left-over waste
is reprocessed.
The material that has been
separated is sold to the
appropriate industries and used to
make things like "rebar"
(reinforced concrete steel),
ceramic tiles and aluminum cans.
Combustion Power is under
contract to the Environmental
Protection Agency and is
primarily a research and
development company. The
company has been dealing with
the problem of solid waste for six
years, and put the recycling
equipment into operation three
years ago. $5 million has been
spent to date.
Pilot Plant
The plant in Menlo Park is only
a pilot plant with the capacity of
processing 100 tons of solid waste
per day. According to Sam
Eveleth, information officer for
the Combustion Power Company,
Combustion Power hopes to have
a full-sized plant in operation in
another year.
Such a plant would cover two
acres, and would require
approximately $7 million of

capital initially. The plant would
be capable of processing 400 tons
of solid waste a day — or enough
to take care of 160,000 people
(figuring five pounds of waste per
person per day).
The plant would also meet
one-tenth of the community's
electrical needs and show a profit
of 31 cents a ton. Because the
plants are fairly small, several
could be scattered through a large
community, thus cutting down on
the costs of transporting the solid
waste.
At the moment, three cities are
considering proposals to build
combustion power units: Grand
Rapids, Mich., Palo Alto and the
East Bay Utilities District.
