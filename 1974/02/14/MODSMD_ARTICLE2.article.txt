# RA. Council Members Discuss Terrace Plan
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Traffic in College Terrace could be
reduced if Stanford allowed Palo Alto
to annex one-third of an acre of land
at the west corner of Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin, according to Vice
Mayor Enid Pearson.
Annexation of the land would
permit the city to construct a road
from Amherst and Stanford Avenues
west across to Bowdoin, Pearson said.
Such a road would deflect traffic away
from the Terrace, thus ameliorating
the region's heavy traffic burden.
"Stanford is part of the area's
traffic problem, so it must be a part of
the solution," Pearson said. "We
originally asked for an entire acre, but
now we find we are only requesting
one third of that. The time has come
for Stanford to compromise."
Refusal
The University has refused to give
up the land, claiming that construction
of a road across Stanford Avenue from
Amherst to Bowdoin would cause
traffic to run too close to homes in the
area, Pearson said. Also, the University
wants to maintain a green belt
between the homes and the road.
But Pearson claimed that the
proposed new street would not
destroy the green belt. She also said
residents of the region would probably
not object to the road.
"Stanford has been responsive, not
to Palo Alto, but only to its own
people," Pearson declared. "The
University doesn't care what happens
to traffic after it leaves the campus."
Strategy
Pearson noted that some Palo Alto
City Council members have a strategy
for persuading the University to give
up the land at Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin.
The members simply will refuse to
annex the Frenchman's Terrace region
until Stanford gives up the third of the
acre, she stated.
Two years ago, the University asked
Palo Alto to annex the land in the
Frenchman's Terrace area, Pearson
explained. The region was the site of a
proposed housing complex for needy
citizens of the Palo Alto region, and
Stanford wanted Palo Alto to provide
municipal services for the area, hence
requesting that the city annex it.
"I have the ace and I am going to
hang onto it," Pearson declared. "The
University usually has had its own way
because it is so powerful but I'm going
to try to achieve a fair compromise in
this situation."
Cooperation Possible
Councilman John Berwald

disagreed with Pearson, however. "I
don't like to see politicians exert
influence to retard Stanford in its
great mission," Berwald said.
"Whenever possible, we should try to
work in cooperation with our
distinguished neighbor, not against it."
Berwald said that a street on what
is now Stanford land at the corner of
Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin would
not solve the traffic problem. The
same amount of traffic would be in
the area, and it would only cause
trouble for people other than those in
the Terrace.
Berwald said he believes that it is
still possible for the Stanford-Palo
Alto Liaison Committee to achieve an
amicable solution at its meeting next
week. He said that it is premature to
discuss the "peripheral" issue of the
Stanford-Bowdoin corner prior to
consideration of the entire dilemma of
the College Terrace traffic burden.
City Councilman Alan Henderson
stated that no one has yet determined
the best solution for the traffic
problem. Although he said that it has
not yet been proven that a road across
Stanford Avenue between Amherst
and Bowdoin would be a good
solution, it entirely possible that it
would be a viable plan.
If it is a workable solution,
Henderson said that he sees nothing
wrong with a compromise in which
Stanford would give up the corner
land in return for the annexation by
Palo Alto.
Secrecy Charged
Pearson said that the entire
problem of traffic in College Terrace
should be discussed in front of an
open meeting of the Stanford-Palo
Alto Liaison Committee. The meeting
next week will probably be conducted
in private, she remarked. Pearson
disparaged the usefulness of a public
forum to discuss the problem
sponsored by the Liaison Committee
two weeks ago.
"I want to have the liaison
committee's meeting held right in the
open, where people can express their
views and where the issue would be
deliberated in full public view,"
Pearson said.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance and
member of the committee, contends
that since the committee must discuss
many sensitive points and is not a
sovereign governing body, it is better
for it to meet privately. The minutes
of the Terrace meeting, will be made
available for the public, as are all of
the committee's meetings he noted.

traffic problem, so it must be a part of
the solution," Pearson said. "We
originally asked for an entire acre, but
now we find we are only requesting
one third of that. The time has come
for Stanford to compromise."
Refusal
The University has refused to give
up the land, claiming that construction
of a road across Stanford Avenue from
Amherst to Bowdoin would cause
traffic to run too close to homes in the
area, Pearson said. Also, the University
wants to maintain a green belt
between the homes and the road.
But Pearson claimed that the
proposed new street would not
destroy the green belt. She also said
residents of the region would probably
not object to the road.
"Stanford has been responsive, not
to Palo Alto, but only to its own
people," Pearson declared. "The
University doesn't care what happens
to traffic after it leaves the campus."
Strategy
Pearson noted that some Palo Alto
City Council members have a strategy
for persuading the University to give
up the land at Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin.
The members simply will refuse to
annex the Frenchman's Terrace region
until Stanford gives up the third of the
acre, she stated.
Two years ago, the University asked
Palo Alto to annex the land in the
Frenchman's Terrace area, Pearson
explained. The region was the site of a
proposed housing complex for needy
citizens of the Palo Alto region, and
Stanford wanted Palo Alto to provide
municipal services for the area, hence
requesting that the city annex it.
"I have the ace and I am going to
hang onto it," Pearson declared. "The
University usually has had its own way
because it is so powerful but I'm going
to try to achieve a fair compromise in
this situation."
Cooperation Possible
Councilman John Berwald

disagreed with Pearson, however. "I
don't like to see politicians exert
influence to retard Stanford in its
great mission," Berwald said.
"Whenever possible, we should try to
work in cooperation with our
distinguished neighbor, not against it."
Berwald said that a street on what
is now Stanford land at the corner of
Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin would
not solve the traffic problem. The
same amount of traffic would be in
the area, and it would only cause
trouble for people other than those in
the Terrace.
Berwald said he believes that it is
still possible for the Stanford-Palo
Alto Liaison Committee to achieve an
amicable solution at its meeting next
week. He said that it is premature to
discuss the "peripheral" issue of the
Stanford-Bowdoin corner prior to
consideration of the entire dilemma of
the College Terrace traffic burden.
City Councilman Alan Henderson
stated that no one has yet determined
the best solution for the traffic
problem. Although he said that it has
not yet been proven that a road across
Stanford Avenue between Amherst
and Bowdoin would be a good
solution, it entirely possible that it
would be a viable plan.
If it is a workable solution,
Henderson said that he sees nothing
wrong with a compromise in which
Stanford would give up the corner
land in return for the annexation by
Palo Alto.
Secrecy Charged
Pearson said that the entire
problem of traffic in College Terrace
should be discussed in front of an
open meeting of the Stanford-Palo
Alto Liaison Committee. The meeting
next week will probably be conducted
in private, she remarked. Pearson
disparaged the usefulness of a public
forum to discuss the problem
sponsored by the Liaison Committee
two weeks ago.
"I want to have the liaison
committee's meeting held right in the
open, where people can express their
views and where the issue would be
deliberated in full public view,"
Pearson said.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance and
member of the committee, contends
that since the committee must discuss
many sensitive points and is not a
sovereign governing body, it is better
for it to meet privately. The minutes
of the Terrace meeting, will be made
available for the public, as are all of
the committee's meetings he noted.
Traffic in College Terrace could be
reduced if Stanford allowed Palo Alto
to annex one-third of an acre of land
at the west corner of Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin, according to Vice
Mayor Enid Pearson.
Annexation of the land would
permit the city to construct a road
from Amherst and Stanford Avenues
west across to Bowdoin, Pearson said.
Such a road would deflect traffic away
from the Terrace, thus ameliorating
the region's heavy traffic burden.

between the homes and the road.
But Pearson claimed that the
proposed new street would not
destroy the green belt. She also said
residents of the region would probably
not object to the road.
"Stanford has been responsive, not
to Palo Alto, but only to its own
people," Pearson declared. "The
University doesn't care what happens
to traffic after it leaves the campus."
Strategy
Pearson noted that some Palo Alto
City Council members have a strategy
for persuading the University to give
up the land at Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin.
The members simply will refuse to
annex the Frenchman's Terrace region
until Stanford gives up the third of the
acre, she stated.
Two years ago, the University asked
Palo Alto to annex the land in the
Frenchman's Terrace area, Pearson
explained. The region was the site of a
proposed housing complex for needy
citizens of the Palo Alto region, and
Stanford wanted Palo Alto to provide
municipal services for the area, hence
requesting that the city annex it.
"I have the ace and I am going to
hang onto it," Pearson declared. "The
University usually has had its own way
because it is so powerful but I'm going
to try to achieve a fair compromise in
this situation."
Cooperation Possible
Councilman John Berwald

disagreed with Pearson, however. "I
don't like to see politicians exert
influence to retard Stanford in its
great mission," Berwald said.
"Whenever possible, we should try to
work in cooperation with our
distinguished neighbor, not against it."
Berwald said that a street on what
is now Stanford land at the corner of
Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin would
not solve the traffic problem. The
same amount of traffic would be in
the area, and it would only cause
trouble for people other than those in
the Terrace.
Berwald said he believes that it is
still possible for the Stanford-Palo
Alto Liaison Committee to achieve an
amicable solution at its meeting next
week. He said that it is premature to
discuss the "peripheral" issue of the
Stanford-Bowdoin corner prior to
consideration of the entire dilemma of
the College Terrace traffic burden.
City Councilman Alan Henderson
stated that no one has yet determined
the best solution for the traffic
problem. Although he said that it has
not yet been proven that a road across
Stanford Avenue between Amherst
and Bowdoin would be a good
solution, it entirely possible that it
would be a viable plan.
If it is a workable solution,
Henderson said that he sees nothing
wrong with a compromise in which
Stanford would give up the corner
land in return for the annexation by
Palo Alto.
Secrecy Charged
Pearson said that the entire
problem of traffic in College Terrace
should be discussed in front of an
open meeting of the Stanford-Palo
Alto Liaison Committee. The meeting
next week will probably be conducted
in private, she remarked. Pearson
disparaged the usefulness of a public
forum to discuss the problem
sponsored by the Liaison Committee
two weeks ago.
"I want to have the liaison
committee's meeting held right in the
open, where people can express their
views and where the issue would be
deliberated in full public view,"
Pearson said.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance and
member of the committee, contends
that since the committee must discuss
many sensitive points and is not a
sovereign governing body, it is better
for it to meet privately. The minutes
of the Terrace meeting, will be made
available for the public, as are all of
the committee's meetings he noted.
