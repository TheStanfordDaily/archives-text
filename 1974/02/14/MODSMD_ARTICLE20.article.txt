NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -
"I think I'd enjoy being in college
again," mused U.S. Sen. Sam J.
Ervin, Jr. as he walked across the
Yale University campus to his
next lecture.
The 77-year-old chairman of
the Senate Watergate committee
spent three days at Yale this
week, compliments of the Chubb
fellowship program that brings
public figures to the campus.
Ervin drew crowds to
classroom lectures â€” mostly on
political science. One junior
admitted he cut his regular class
to hear the anecdote-spiced
comments by the North Carolina
Democrat.
Other students vied for the
privilege of eating with the
senator during the visit that ended
yesterday.
Clad in a light raincoat and
cossack hat, Ervin walked to most
of his appointments despite
near-freezing temperatures.
One carload of voung people

stopped and gave him a cheer.
Two students, one with an
"impeach" sign on his briefcase,
paused to exchange greetings.
Ervin's comments reflected his
enjoyment of the
somewhat-slower campus pace.
"In Washington, as chairman of
one committee and two
sub-committees, very seldom does
20 minutes pass without the
telephone ringing or a member of
my staff wanting me for
something," he said.
Ervin slept and ate at Timothy
Dwight College. The college's
master, Homer D. Babbridge, said
Ervin was "obviously close to the
ideal Chubb fellow.
"He relates well with the
students ... and, frankly, he likes
to talk.
Jeremy Bulow, who cut his
regular class to join about 50
others for an Ervin lecture,
commented: "It's obvious he's in
his 70s, but he's likeable and very
sharp."
