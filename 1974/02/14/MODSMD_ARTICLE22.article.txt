# Cinderella Liberty Is Meaty Romance
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
Cinderella Liberty is a
romantic social treatise which, to
quote its directior, Mark Rydell,
"is openly in support of
involvement. It is anti-cynical and
it advocates taking responsibility
for other human beings as a mark
of maturity. These are affirmative
characteristics and they are useful
in an age of cynicism and apathy.
The film is saying 'Don't give
up.' "
Rydell is outspoken about the
premises underlying his work. He
is extremely skeptical of film
critics, believing they should be
required to work on a film at least
a year before being given a place
in the media. He also believes,
rather radically, that the media
should limit all film advertising to
the same space and format so that
there can be no competition
among films in the ads themselves.
That way, films would have to
make it on their merits via the
word-of-mouth endorsement of
those who see them.
Film is such a profound
cultural medium in modern life,
Rydell believes that film-makers
cannot avoid making social
comment and causing changes in
the way people think, in the
course of their work. That
philosophy flies in the face of
most movie producers, who come
to town moaning how they wish
people would stop seeing film as
anythingother thanentertainment.
Whereas producers of that kind
disdain questions from the press
about what their films are trying
to say ("yÂ° u te" us '" * s their
attitude), Rydell says,"I prefer
questions that get to the heart of
the matter."
James Caan plays the romantic
lead as John Baggs. He falls in love
with a bargirl, Maggie (Marsha
Mason), who makes her living by

winning dollar bets on pool games
which she hustles through like
Minnesota Eats and by getting
kickbacks from the bartender who
serves her tea when the boys in
the bar think they are buying her
drinks. In addition, she receives
public-welfare child support for
an 11-year-old mulatto son and
occasionally selling "favors" to
sailors.
The film is full of poignant
moments and, although motivated
by the same "new" humanistic
morality that prevails in the media
these days, it has more spiritual
perception than most. The most
moving scene is a conversation
following Maggie's realization that
John Baggs intends to take
responsibiltiy for her and for
Doug's upbringing.
"What's your religion?" she
asks.
"Basement Baptist," he replies.
"My Dad was the janitor of a large
church and every Sunday we
would tend the furnace during the
services and listen. He died when I
was 12."
"He was religious, wasn't he?"
she returns.
He nods.
"Do you have a lot of rules?"
"A few on marriage is all. ... I
don't go for swearing. I don't like
lies. And I'll never hit you."
Tears well up in her eyes on
the last statement, as the camera
closes in on a long scar on her
back, which Baggs touches
tenderly.
Cinderella Liberty is a far more
meaty romance than The Way We
Were, which is being hailed as
"romance of the year." James
Caan and Marsha Mason both
outperform Redford and
Streisand, in roles which are far
superior. I hope the new
Cinderella is as well received by
the audience as it deserves to be.
