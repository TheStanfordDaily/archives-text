# Dylan Rolls Perfectly
## 
### RANDY BAKER 
OAKLAND — The Band: Rick Danko on bass;
Richard Manuel on piano, drums, organ; Garth
Hudson on organ, piano; Levon Helm on drums,
Robbie Robertson on lead guitar. Nowhere will you
find a group of five more talented musicians. They
can play a dozen instruments, they can double on
keyboards or drums, they have three strong lead
singers. Even when they are on their own, they are
the best group in rock. But, when you add Bob
Dylan to this combination the whole thing moves
one step beyond, to an entirely different level.
When things are going well, Bob Dylan and The
Band have no competition.
'Perfect'
On Monday night, Feb. 11, at the Oakland
Coliseum, things went very well. Bob Dylan and
The Band played two shows which many of the
crowd could only describe as "perfect."
I had seen Dylan and The Band earlier, in
Chicago, at the first two shows of this tour, and
they had been far from perfect. The shows in
Chicago had not formally been rehearsed, and were
largely improvisation. Improvisation is not one of
The Band's greatest talents and thus the shows were
very rough-edged. Since then they have come a long
way, and the shows in Oakland were finely
polished.
I have heard from people who attended both
shows in Oakland that the later show was better.
This was the one that I saw. Dylan and The Band
took the stage at 10:30 and pounded out a tight
version of "Most Likely You Go Your Way (And
I'll Go Mine)."
A main criticism of the shows in Chicago was
that Dylan seemed to ignore the crowd. In
Oakland, from the very first song, there was no
question that Dylan was playing to the audience.
He appeared to be quite comfortable onstage, and
after the song he said "Thank you. I finally made it
to the San Francisco Bay Area!" The crowd loved
it.
The Band Improves
Dylan and The Band followed with a beautiful
rendition of "Lay Lady Lay," Robbie Robertson's
guitar perfectly underscoring each line. The next
song, "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues," showed just
how much they had improved since the tour's start.
The song was greatly expanded through solos by
Robertson and organist Garth Hudson. Also, in
Oakland Dylan performed the entire song, whereas
in Chicago he had left out the fourth verse.
"Rainy Day Woman No. 12 & 35," perhaps
better known by the refrain "everybody must get
stoned," followed next. Then came "It Ain't Me
Babe," with Danko and Robertson singing along on
the chorus. Dylan then switched from rhythm
guitar to piano, to pound out "Ballad of a Thin
Man."
Dylan left the stage, and The Band started a solo
set with "Stage Fright," a song featuring Garth
Hudson on organ and Rick Danko on vocals and
fretless bass guitar. Drummer Levon Helm sang
"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," a song
that guitarist Robertson wrote especially for him.
Next, Richard Manuel rasped out a version of
"King Harvest." His voice, which was nearly gone,
threatened to give out completely. Danko sang
"When You Awake," and Helm sang a superb
version of "Up on Cripple Creek."
Dylan returned and they played a Hendrix-style
version of "All Along the Watchtower." Dylan
spoke the words more than sang them, while
Robertson did his best to outdo Hendrix on lead

guitar. Then came a rocking version of "The Ballad
of Hollis Brown," and, to close the first half,
"Knockin' on Heaven's Door." On this song, it was
easy to see how much Garth Hudson's organ work
adds to and fills out the sound of The Band.
Solo Set
After a brief intermission, Dylan came onstage
with acoustic guitar and harmonica, to do a solo
set. He opened with "The Times They Are
A-Changin' " and, unlike the shows in Chicago, he
got all the words right. He. followed with "Just Like
A Woman" and "Gates of Eden." "Don't Think
Twice, It's All Right" was outstanding for its harp
work, and the audience responded with a standing
ovation.
Then, with the stage bathed in red, white and
blue lights, came one of the show's highlights: "It's
Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)." Dylan played a
tremendously fast-paced version, spitting out the
words as quick as he could. The crowd responded
to many individual lines — most notably when
Dylan sang "Even the president of the United
States sometimes must have to stand naked!"
The Band returned for a short solo set. They
displayed their amazing versatility on "Rag Mama
Rag." Next came "This Wheel's on Fire," a song
that Danko co-wrote with Dylan. Manuel sang a
superb version of "Shape I'm In," his voice much
improved from his earlier effort. They closed with a
knock-out version of "The Weight," (take a load
off Fanny ...) with Levon Helm singing lead.
"Forever Young"
Dylan returned and led off with "Forever
Young," a song from his new album. What they
have done with this song is simpiy amazing. One of
the low-points of the Chicago concert, it was one of
the strongest numbers of the Oakland show. They
have transformed it almost completely. A fine
version of "Highway 61 Revisited" followed, and
then came the highlight of the concert. With the
opening lines of "Like A Rolling Stone" the crowd
surged forward to rush the stage. The Coliseum
Lights came on and 14,000 people stood up — to
clap, to dance, to shout out the words of the song
along with Dylan. It was an astounding scene.
The ovation which followed lasted for minutes
and, of course, much of the crowd lit matches.
Dylan and The Band finally reappeared, to do a
double encore. "Maggie's Farm" came first and
featured some fine guitarwork from Robbie
Robertson. Then they did, strange as it may seem,
an electric version of "Blowin' in the Wind." It was
great. The Coliseum crowd made a valiant effort for
still another encore and didn't stop cheering until
stage hands began to dismantle the set-up.
As the crowd left, everyone appeared to be quite
satisfied. They had come to see a great performance
by Bob Dylan; that's what they had gotten. Of
course, they will always be those who found some
fault with the performance, those who may
complain that Dylan didn't speak to the audience
enough. What these people don't realize is that Bob
Dylan didn't have to talk to the audience. The
music said it all.
