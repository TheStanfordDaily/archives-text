New Energy Conferenee Plans Set
WASHINGTON — Despite French objections, the
Washington energy conference yesterday agreed to set up
machinery for a new conference of oil-consuming and
producing nations at the earliest opportunity.
The conference left open the possibility that consumer
countries would meet again. France disagreed on many
points but signed the communique as a whole.
The efforts to compromise the French views with those
of the other 12 nations sent the conference, originally
scheduled only for Monday and Tuesday, into a third day.
At a news conference later, French Foreign Minister
Michel Jobert indicated he felt that the proposals went
beyond Common Market principles, which provide for an
economic, not a political community.
All the foreign ministers, including France, agreed that
solutions to the world's energy problems should be sought
in consultation with the producer countries.
Reineeke Bides Time In D.C.
Lt. Gov. Ed Reineeke's campaign for governor of
California twisted slowly in the wind yesterday as the
state's No. 2 Republican waited in Washington, D.C. for
word from the special Watergate prosecutor.
Reineeke confirmed in interviews with Washington
newsmen that his sudden departure Monday from
California was related to the current Watergate grand jury
probe of the ITT antitrust case, in which Reineeke played a
major role.
But Reineeke refused to give details of exactly what he
is doing in Washington with two personal attorneys, except
to say that he visited the National Archives Tuesday and
planned to visit the Washington Memorial and Lincoln
Memorial yesterday.
He said the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.
investigation "has not hurt, but has postponed" the
gubernatorial campaign which he originally had planned to
launch Monday.
That campaign "is on the brink of very serious trouble,"
he added in another interview.
Arabs Gather Alter Caneellation
ALGIERS — Four Arab leaders gathered here yesterday
after a meeting in Libya to discuss the Arab oil embargo
against the United States was canceled.
Government-controlled Egyptian newspapers said the
Libya meeting was canceled to prevent a clash between
Arabs who favor and oppose the lifting of the embargo.
The reports from Cairo circulated as the "Big Four"
Arab leaders gathered here in close secrecy for a hurriedly

arranged two-day summit meeting. Egypt's President Anwar
Sadat, Syria's President Hafez Assad and Saudi Arabia's
King Faisal joined Algeria's President Houari Boumedienne,
current president of the Arab League, for the summit.
There was speculation among diplomats that today's
long-scheduled Tripoli meeting, which was abruptly
canceled yesterday, might have found itself out of step with
decisions on the oil embargo taken by the "Big Four."
Nixon Proposes Transit Aid
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has proposed a
$19.3-billion re venue-sharing program designed to improve
the nation's public transportation system.
He also asked Congress yesterday to approve a program
to revitalize the nation's rail system through a massive
program of government loan guarantees and through
relaxed regulatory procedures.
Both proposals have been in the works for some time
but the President said the energy crisis brought home the
need for improvements in mass transit and rail systems.
"The energy crisis has underscored an important lesson:
our system of national transportation is not working at
maximum efficiency," the President said in a message to
Congress.
"As our society grows and our economy continues to
expand, we must insure that the efficiency of this system
keeps stride with the changing demands placed on it."
The President's plan, if approved by Congress, would
make $2.3 billion available to large cities and slightly over
$1.1 billion available to towns of under 50,000 and to rural
areas in the fiscal year starting July 1.
Ex-P O W To Run For Congress
SANTA ANA — David C. Rehmann, a prisoner of the
North Vietnamese for more than six years, has announced
his candidacy for the Republican nomination for the 38th
Congressional District.
Rehmann, 31, of Garden Grove, announced his
intentions Tuesday — one year to the day after he was
released from captivity. His candidacy makes him the first
former Vietnam POW to seek public office in California.
A photograph of Rehmann, with a broken arm and
bloodied face being marched through Hanoi, was used
widely on literature of POW organizations in the United
States.
