# Frats Survive Fiscal, Membership Troubles
## 
### SANDY WHITE Second Of Three Parts 
(Editor's note: This article explores
funding of and rules governing
fraternity practices from Stanford's
early days to the present.)

Stanford fraternities have a long
history of economic and social change.
Problems of financing, construction
and membership qualifications plague
most fraternities — Stanford differs in
that it breaks away from traditional
fraternity stereotypes.
Here, fraternities do not have total
independence from the University,
particularly in the area of land
ownership, but they aren't strictly
bound by the regulations governing
other fraternities across the country.
Until 1957, most fraternities owned
their houses, often with a mortgage
from the University. Fraternity
budgets could not cover renovation
costs, and as a result the houses
deteriorated.
Alumni could not make
tax-deductible gifts to maintain the
houses, because the land was
University-owned. By the earlv 1950s,

many houses needed major
improvements, and some wanted to
expand.
The Alpha Sigs asked to rebuild
their house, but the University told
them to wait. Stanford already had
long-range construction plans for
fraternity sites, and in 1957, the Board
of Trustees drafted the Undergraduate
Men's Housing Program.
The plan called for the relocation
of all 24 fraternities into four clusters.
To save money, each cluster was to
have a central kitchen, similar to the
Florence Moore arrangement.
However, the University would own
the houses, causing consternation
among some frat members.
But planners cited three financial
advantages to the plan: tax-deductible
contributions could be made to the
University, earmarked for a certain
fraternity; low cost federal loans
would become available to pay half
the construction costs; and no
property tax would have to be paid.
Financial Problems
The clusters did not work out as
planned, however. Builders did not

complete the first until 1962, and the
second was not finished until a year
later. The fraternities vetoed the
central kitchen plan and
already-soaring construction prices
rose even further as a result.
Although the cluster houses have
almost twice the capacity of the old
fraternity houses, full membership was
hard to maintain during the 60s
because many men had grown
disaffected from the frats.
The problem was so acute that
Cluster 111, completed in 1968, is now
80 percent non-fraternity. Ironically,
the cluster proved a better investment
in student housing than in fraternities.
Stanford now has a new flexible
policy, which «s less ambitious than
the cluster project, and more attentive
to the fraternities' needs. Any house in
need of repair can be moved,
renovated, or replaced. Each project
will be planned, financed, and
completed separately.
In many cases, the funds will come
from tax-deductible gifts, making the
University the owner of the house.
The housing problems of a

fraternity can be solved by tax
loopholes and large infusions of
money. But other problems — lack of
campus acceptance, difficulties in
attracting new members, the conflict
between fraternity tradition and
change, and a confusion of purpose —
are harder to pinpoint and eliminate.
Two traditional objections to
fraternities are sins which President
John Casper Branner warned of 60
years ago — "undemocracy" and
extravagance, as well as what he
termed "altogether too strenuous"
living. Specifically, critics have charged
that fraternities have been too
exclusive, have hazed their new
pledges, have held overly expensive
parties, and have maintained poor
academic records.
The charge of exclusiveness stems
from the fraternity recruitment
system. For many years, fraternity
membership was a sign of social
acceptance, yet the 24 fraternities
housed only 750 students.
Fraternity Exclusiveness
During rush, fraternities held
parties and dinners, took rushees up to
San Francisco and otherwise wooed
the more "desirable" freshmen. Ernest
Lewis, a Phi Delt, wrote in 1892 that
exclusiveness was "the great good of
fraternities." It was important, he said,
for them to seek "not quantity, but
quality."
The rush screening procedure was
described by an ex-frat man in a 1966
Daily article as "dehumanizing" to the
freshmen. Fraternity members
discussed the prospective pledges and
assigned them to categories — yes, no,
or maybe. Each group had its jargon —
one member described a rushee as
"not nucleus material, but definitely
an electron."
If a rushee was "blackballed" or
"dinged" by one member, he was
automatically removed from
consideration.
When the rushee became pledged,
and then initiated, he had to pass
several tests during "Hell Week." A
booklet written in 1965 by eight
ex-fraternity men called Hell Week
"sometimes sadistic, perverse, gross,
and degrading." One popular trick was
driving a pledge to the top of Skyline
Boulevard at midnight and abandoning

him.
Though Hell Week was abolished in
1946 and renamed "Help Week," the
recent nude trek through UGLY by a
Zeta Psi initiate, and early-morning
dips in Mem Claw indicate that hazing
is not a lost art.
All-White Organizations
Fraternities were exclusive, not
only because of arbitrary selection
procedures, but also because most
were all-white, all-Christian
organizations. One fraternity man
returning from World War II found
that his brotherhood had pledged a
student of another race. His anger led
to the resignation of all the pledges.
In 1961, ATO pledged four Jewish
students and was promptly dropped

from its national organization.
Its action was the first in a series
which set apart Stanford's fraternities
as mavericks. The Kappa Sigs pledged
a black in 1963, and were suspended
two years later. Sigma Chi was also
suspended by its national fraternity in
1965 when it pledged a black.
The national organizations
defended their actions by referring to
tradition, saying that their rules were
reflections of the wishes of all the
brothers. Many have since loosened
standards, and Sigma Chi is now trying
to rejoin its parent organization.
(Tomorrow the concluding part of
this series will explore the current role
of the fraternity and will examine
fraternity membership in detail.)

particularly in the area of land
ownership, but they aren't strictly
bound by the regulations governing
other fraternities across the country.
Until 1957, most fraternities owned
their houses, often with a mortgage
from the University. Fraternity
budgets could not cover renovation
costs, and as a result the houses
deteriorated.
Alumni could not make
tax-deductible gifts to maintain the
houses, because the land was
University-owned. By the earlv 1950s,

many houses needed major
improvements, and some wanted to
expand.
The Alpha Sigs asked to rebuild
their house, but the University told
them to wait. Stanford already had
long-range construction plans for
fraternity sites, and in 1957, the Board
of Trustees drafted the Undergraduate
Men's Housing Program.
The plan called for the relocation
of all 24 fraternities into four clusters.
To save money, each cluster was to
have a central kitchen, similar to the
Florence Moore arrangement.
However, the University would own
the houses, causing consternation
among some frat members.
But planners cited three financial
advantages to the plan: tax-deductible
contributions could be made to the
University, earmarked for a certain
fraternity; low cost federal loans
would become available to pay half
the construction costs; and no
property tax would have to be paid.
Financial Problems
The clusters did not work out as
planned, however. Builders did not

complete the first until 1962, and the
second was not finished until a year
later. The fraternities vetoed the
central kitchen plan and
already-soaring construction prices
rose even further as a result.
Although the cluster houses have
almost twice the capacity of the old
fraternity houses, full membership was
hard to maintain during the 60s
because many men had grown
disaffected from the frats.
The problem was so acute that
Cluster 111, completed in 1968, is now
80 percent non-fraternity. Ironically,
the cluster proved a better investment
in student housing than in fraternities.
Stanford now has a new flexible
policy, which «s less ambitious than
the cluster project, and more attentive
to the fraternities' needs. Any house in
need of repair can be moved,
renovated, or replaced. Each project
will be planned, financed, and
completed separately.
In many cases, the funds will come
from tax-deductible gifts, making the
University the owner of the house.
The housing problems of a

fraternity can be solved by tax
loopholes and large infusions of
money. But other problems — lack of
campus acceptance, difficulties in
attracting new members, the conflict
between fraternity tradition and
change, and a confusion of purpose —
are harder to pinpoint and eliminate.
Two traditional objections to
fraternities are sins which President
John Casper Branner warned of 60
years ago — "undemocracy" and
extravagance, as well as what he
termed "altogether too strenuous"
living. Specifically, critics have charged
that fraternities have been too
exclusive, have hazed their new
pledges, have held overly expensive
parties, and have maintained poor
academic records.
The charge of exclusiveness stems
from the fraternity recruitment
system. For many years, fraternity
membership was a sign of social
acceptance, yet the 24 fraternities
housed only 750 students.
Fraternity Exclusiveness
During rush, fraternities held
parties and dinners, took rushees up to
San Francisco and otherwise wooed
the more "desirable" freshmen. Ernest
Lewis, a Phi Delt, wrote in 1892 that
exclusiveness was "the great good of
fraternities." It was important, he said,
for them to seek "not quantity, but
quality."
The rush screening procedure was
described by an ex-frat man in a 1966
Daily article as "dehumanizing" to the
freshmen. Fraternity members
discussed the prospective pledges and
assigned them to categories — yes, no,
or maybe. Each group had its jargon —
one member described a rushee as
"not nucleus material, but definitely
an electron."
If a rushee was "blackballed" or
"dinged" by one member, he was
automatically removed from
consideration.
When the rushee became pledged,
and then initiated, he had to pass
several tests during "Hell Week." A
booklet written in 1965 by eight
ex-fraternity men called Hell Week
"sometimes sadistic, perverse, gross,
and degrading." One popular trick was
driving a pledge to the top of Skyline
Boulevard at midnight and abandoning

him.
Though Hell Week was abolished in
1946 and renamed "Help Week," the
recent nude trek through UGLY by a
Zeta Psi initiate, and early-morning
dips in Mem Claw indicate that hazing
is not a lost art.
All-White Organizations
Fraternities were exclusive, not
only because of arbitrary selection
procedures, but also because most
were all-white, all-Christian
organizations. One fraternity man
returning from World War II found
that his brotherhood had pledged a
student of another race. His anger led
to the resignation of all the pledges.
In 1961, ATO pledged four Jewish
students and was promptly dropped

from its national organization.
Its action was the first in a series
which set apart Stanford's fraternities
as mavericks. The Kappa Sigs pledged
a black in 1963, and were suspended
two years later. Sigma Chi was also
suspended by its national fraternity in
1965 when it pledged a black.
The national organizations
defended their actions by referring to
tradition, saying that their rules were
reflections of the wishes of all the
brothers. Many have since loosened
standards, and Sigma Chi is now trying
to rejoin its parent organization.
(Tomorrow the concluding part of
this series will explore the current role
of the fraternity and will examine
fraternity membership in detail.)

funding of and rules governing
fraternity practices from Stanford's

University-owned. By the earlv 1950s,

many houses needed major
improvements, and some wanted to
expand.
The Alpha Sigs asked to rebuild
their house, but the University told
them to wait. Stanford already had
long-range construction plans for
fraternity sites, and in 1957, the Board
of Trustees drafted the Undergraduate
Men's Housing Program.
The plan called for the relocation
of all 24 fraternities into four clusters.
To save money, each cluster was to
have a central kitchen, similar to the
Florence Moore arrangement.
However, the University would own
the houses, causing consternation
among some frat members.
But planners cited three financial
advantages to the plan: tax-deductible
contributions could be made to the
University, earmarked for a certain
fraternity; low cost federal loans
would become available to pay half
the construction costs; and no
property tax would have to be paid.
Financial Problems
The clusters did not work out as
planned, however. Builders did not

complete the first until 1962, and the
second was not finished until a year
later. The fraternities vetoed the
central kitchen plan and
already-soaring construction prices
rose even further as a result.
Although the cluster houses have
almost twice the capacity of the old
fraternity houses, full membership was
hard to maintain during the 60s
because many men had grown
disaffected from the frats.
The problem was so acute that
Cluster 111, completed in 1968, is now
80 percent non-fraternity. Ironically,
the cluster proved a better investment
in student housing than in fraternities.
Stanford now has a new flexible
policy, which «s less ambitious than
the cluster project, and more attentive
to the fraternities' needs. Any house in
need of repair can be moved,
renovated, or replaced. Each project
will be planned, financed, and
completed separately.
In many cases, the funds will come
from tax-deductible gifts, making the
University the owner of the house.
The housing problems of a

fraternity can be solved by tax
loopholes and large infusions of
money. But other problems — lack of
campus acceptance, difficulties in
attracting new members, the conflict
between fraternity tradition and
change, and a confusion of purpose —
are harder to pinpoint and eliminate.
Two traditional objections to
fraternities are sins which President
John Casper Branner warned of 60
years ago — "undemocracy" and
extravagance, as well as what he
termed "altogether too strenuous"
living. Specifically, critics have charged
that fraternities have been too
exclusive, have hazed their new
pledges, have held overly expensive
parties, and have maintained poor
academic records.
The charge of exclusiveness stems
from the fraternity recruitment
system. For many years, fraternity
membership was a sign of social
acceptance, yet the 24 fraternities
housed only 750 students.
Fraternity Exclusiveness
During rush, fraternities held
parties and dinners, took rushees up to
San Francisco and otherwise wooed
the more "desirable" freshmen. Ernest
Lewis, a Phi Delt, wrote in 1892 that
exclusiveness was "the great good of
fraternities." It was important, he said,
for them to seek "not quantity, but
quality."
The rush screening procedure was
described by an ex-frat man in a 1966
Daily article as "dehumanizing" to the
freshmen. Fraternity members
discussed the prospective pledges and
assigned them to categories — yes, no,
or maybe. Each group had its jargon —
one member described a rushee as
"not nucleus material, but definitely
an electron."
If a rushee was "blackballed" or
"dinged" by one member, he was
automatically removed from
consideration.
When the rushee became pledged,
and then initiated, he had to pass
several tests during "Hell Week." A
booklet written in 1965 by eight
ex-fraternity men called Hell Week
"sometimes sadistic, perverse, gross,
and degrading." One popular trick was
driving a pledge to the top of Skyline
Boulevard at midnight and abandoning

him.
Though Hell Week was abolished in
1946 and renamed "Help Week," the
recent nude trek through UGLY by a
Zeta Psi initiate, and early-morning
dips in Mem Claw indicate that hazing
is not a lost art.
All-White Organizations
Fraternities were exclusive, not
only because of arbitrary selection
procedures, but also because most
were all-white, all-Christian
organizations. One fraternity man
returning from World War II found
that his brotherhood had pledged a
student of another race. His anger led
to the resignation of all the pledges.
In 1961, ATO pledged four Jewish
students and was promptly dropped

from its national organization.
Its action was the first in a series
which set apart Stanford's fraternities
as mavericks. The Kappa Sigs pledged
a black in 1963, and were suspended
two years later. Sigma Chi was also
suspended by its national fraternity in
1965 when it pledged a black.
The national organizations
defended their actions by referring to
tradition, saying that their rules were
reflections of the wishes of all the
brothers. Many have since loosened
standards, and Sigma Chi is now trying
to rejoin its parent organization.
(Tomorrow the concluding part of
this series will explore the current role
of the fraternity and will examine
fraternity membership in detail.)
(Editor's note: This article explores
funding of and rules governing
fraternity practices from Stanford's
early days to the present.)

Stanford fraternities have a long
history of economic and social change.
Problems of financing, construction
and membership qualifications plague
most fraternities — Stanford differs in
that it breaks away from traditional
fraternity stereotypes.
Here, fraternities do not have total
independence from the University,
particularly in the area of land
ownership, but they aren't strictly
bound by the regulations governing
other fraternities across the country.
Until 1957, most fraternities owned
their houses, often with a mortgage
from the University. Fraternity
budgets could not cover renovation
costs, and as a result the houses
deteriorated.

tax-deductible gifts to maintain the
houses, because the land was
