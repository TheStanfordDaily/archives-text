# Frats Survive Fiscal, Membership Troubles

### SANDY WHITE Second Of Three Parts 
(Editor's note: This article explores
funding of and rules governing
fraternity practices from Stanford's
early days to the present.)

Stanford fraternities have a long
history of economic and social change.
Problems of financing, construction
and membership qualifications plague
most fraternities — Stanford differs in
that it breaks away from traditional
fraternity stereotypes.
Here, fraternities do not have total
independence from the University,
particularly in the area of land
ownership, but they aren't strictly
bound by the regulations governing
other fraternities across the country.
Until 1957, most fraternities owned
their houses, often with a mortgage
from the University. Fraternity
budgets could not cover renovation
costs, and as a result the houses
deteriorated.
Alumni could not make
tax-deductible gifts to maintain the
houses, because the land was
University-owned. By the earlv 1950s,

many houses needed major
improvements, and some wanted to
expand.
The Alpha Sigs asked to rebuild
their house, but the University told
them to wait. Stanford already had
long-range construction plans for
fraternity sites, and in 1957, the Board
of Trustees drafted the Undergraduate
Men's Housing Program.
The plan called for the relocation
of all 24 fraternities into four clusters.
To save money, each cluster was to
have a central kitchen, similar to the
Florence Moore arrangement.
However, the University would own
the houses, causing consternation
among some frat members.
But planners cited three financial
advantages to the plan: tax-deductible
contributions could be made to the
University, earmarked for a certain
fraternity; low cost federal loans
would become available to pay half
the construction costs; and no
property tax would have to be paid.
Financial Problems
The clusters did not work out as
planned, however. Builders did not

complete the first until 1962, and the
second was not finished until a year
later. The fraternities vetoed the
central kitchen plan and
already-soaring construction prices
rose even further as a result.
Although the cluster houses have
almost twice the capacity of the old
fraternity houses, full membership was
hard to maintain during the 60s
because many men had grown
disaffected from the frats.
The problem was so acute that
Cluster 111, completed in 1968, is now
80 percent non-fraternity. Ironically,
the cluster proved a better investment
in student housing than in fraternities.
Stanford now has a new flexible
policy, which «s less ambitious than
the cluster project, and more attentive
to the fraternities' needs. Any house in
need of repair can be moved,
renovated, or replaced. Each project
will be planned, financed, and
completed separately.
In many cases, the funds will come
from tax-deductible gifts, making the
University the owner of the house.
The housing problems of a

fraternity can be solved by tax
loopholes and large infusions of
money. But other problems — lack of
campus acceptance, difficulties in
attracting new members, the conflict
between fraternity tradition and
change, and a confusion of purpose —
are harder to pinpoint and eliminate.
Two traditional objections to
fraternities are sins which President
John Casper Branner warned of 60
years ago — "undemocracy" and
extravagance, as well as what he
termed "altogether too strenuous"
living. Specifically, critics have charged
that fraternities have been too
exclusive, have hazed their new
pledges, have held overly expensive
parties, and have maintained poor
academic records.
The charge of exclusiveness stems
from the fraternity recruitment
system. For many years, fraternity
membership was a sign of social
acceptance, yet the 24 fraternities
housed only 750 students.
