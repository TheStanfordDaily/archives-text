### 
Nobel Prize-winning author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, banished
from his own country yesterday, has
been offered an invitation to come to
Stanford.
A telegram signed by University
President Richard W. Lyman and
Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell offered "to facilitate your
work and to accommodate you and
your family here."
Lyman was in Washington, D.C. last
night and reportedly approved the
telegram by telephone. Campbell,
reached at his Los Altos Hills home,
would say only that he would be "very

pleased" to have a man of
Solzhenitsyn's stature at the Hoover
Institution.
The telegram was dispatched
yesterday to the Soviet dissident in
care of Heinrich 8011, the West
German Nobel laureate with whom he
is staying.

Richard W. Lyman,
President, Stanford University
W. Glenn Campbell,
Director, Hoover Institution"
Assoc. History Prof. Terence
Emmons told the Daily last night that
he, Slavic Prof. Edward J. Brown and
History Prof. Alexander Dallin first
proposed the idea yesterday.
Emmons said he contacted
Campbell while Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig talked to Lyman. The

telegram itself was sent late yesterday
afternoon.
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace contains an
extensive collection of material on
Soviet history, a subject which has
provided the basis for many of
Solzhenitsyn's works, including One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich —
his only work to be published in his
own country — and the recently-issued
The Gulag Archipelago.
Lyman said from Washington last
night that he thinks that Solzhenitsyn
is "aware of the richness" of the
Hoover material.
Goodwill
Asked whether the telegram was a
goodwill gesture or a firm offer,
Lyman said it was "somewhere in
between." He noted, however, that the
offer was indeed a goodwill gesture "in
the most profound sense of that
term."
Lyman added that he was
somewhat surprised that the telegram
had been made public, and said he
hoped that the offer would cause no
embarrassment for Solzhenitsyn or his
family, which remains in the Soviet
Union.
Stanford was for many years the
home of another famous Russian
exile: Alexander Kerensky, who
headed the provisional government
that replaced Czar Nicholas II in 1917
and was in turn toppled by the

Bolsheviks later that year. Kerensky
died in 1970 at the age of 89.
New Life
Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn himself,
tired and stunned, arrived in
Langenbroich, West Germany, to begin
his new life in exile.
"Now I simply have to collect
myself and to understand my
situation," he told newsmen before
telephoning his wife in Moscow.
He made his brief remarks in the
courtyard of Boll's country retreat in
the rolling Eifel Mountains,
Solzhenitsyn's first haven outside the
Soviet Union.
"You understand, I am very tired. I
am worried. I am worried about my
family . . said the 55-year-old
author. He brushed aside any
questions.
He added he would refuse
interviews for several days.
He said he first learned he was to be
expelled at 1 p.m. Moscow time
yesterday, about two hours before the
scheduled departure of the flight for
Frankfurt.
In Moscow, Solzhenitsyn's wife,
Natalya Svetlova, said she spoke with
her husband for about 15 minutes. She
said he told her he was all right after
his 26-hour ordeal that began when
secret police muscled into their
apartment Tuesday night and dragged
him away.
She said Solzhenitsyn told her he
was escorted by eight men on the
Soviet jetliner that brought him
involuntarily to Germany.
Frankfurt Arrival
Regarded in the West as the greatest
living Russian author, Solzhenitsyn
arrived at Frankfurt airport in late
afternoon. Newsmen were barred from
approaching the plane which taxied to
a far station on the tarmac.
Only one person met the author in
Frankfurt. Gerlinde Kutschera, an
airport employee who had learned that
Solzhenitsyn was aboard the plane,
rushed to the ramp and handed him a
single rose as he deplaned.
The last Soviet citizen of equal
prominence to be forcibly deported
was Leon Trotsky, who was thrust
across the Turkish border in 1929
after losing a power struggle with Josef
Stalin.
The Soviet news agency Tass
announced in Moscow that the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's parliament, had stripped the
author of his citizenship "for
performing systematically actions that
are incompatible with being a citizen
of the U.S.S.R. and detrimental to the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
It added he was exiled yesterday
and that his family will be allowed to
join him "when they deem it
necessary."
Campaign
Solzhenitsyn's arrest and expulsion
from the Soviet Union climaxed a
campaign of criticism and abuse in the

Soviet press, radio and television
following publication in the West of
The Gulag Archipelago, two months
ago.
The book, an account of the
Stalinist concentration camp system,
under which Solzhenitsyn had spent
eight years as a prisoner, traced the
origins of camp terror to Vladimir I.
Lenin, founder of the Soviet state and
revered by the nation's present leaders.
The West German government
announced that it had been informed
in advance by the Kremlin that
Solzhenitsyn would be coming to
Germany, and spokesman Ruediger
von Wechmar said the country was
prepared to accept him.

Richard W. Lyman,
President, Stanford University
W. Glenn Campbell,
Director, Hoover Institution"
Assoc. History Prof. Terence
Emmons told the Daily last night that
he, Slavic Prof. Edward J. Brown and
History Prof. Alexander Dallin first
proposed the idea yesterday.
Emmons said he contacted
Campbell while Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig talked to Lyman. The

telegram itself was sent late yesterday
afternoon.
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace contains an
extensive collection of material on
Soviet history, a subject which has
provided the basis for many of
Solzhenitsyn's works, including One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich —
his only work to be published in his
own country — and the recently-issued
The Gulag Archipelago.
Lyman said from Washington last
night that he thinks that Solzhenitsyn
is "aware of the richness" of the
Hoover material.
Goodwill
Asked whether the telegram was a
goodwill gesture or a firm offer,
Lyman said it was "somewhere in
between." He noted, however, that the
offer was indeed a goodwill gesture "in
the most profound sense of that
term."
Lyman added that he was
somewhat surprised that the telegram
had been made public, and said he
hoped that the offer would cause no
embarrassment for Solzhenitsyn or his
family, which remains in the Soviet
Union.
Stanford was for many years the
home of another famous Russian
exile: Alexander Kerensky, who
headed the provisional government
that replaced Czar Nicholas II in 1917
and was in turn toppled by the

Bolsheviks later that year. Kerensky
died in 1970 at the age of 89.
New Life
Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn himself,
tired and stunned, arrived in
Langenbroich, West Germany, to begin
his new life in exile.
"Now I simply have to collect
myself and to understand my
situation," he told newsmen before
telephoning his wife in Moscow.
He made his brief remarks in the
courtyard of Boll's country retreat in
the rolling Eifel Mountains,
Solzhenitsyn's first haven outside the
Soviet Union.
"You understand, I am very tired. I
am worried. I am worried about my
family . . said the 55-year-old
author. He brushed aside any
questions.
He added he would refuse
interviews for several days.
He said he first learned he was to be
expelled at 1 p.m. Moscow time
yesterday, about two hours before the
scheduled departure of the flight for
Frankfurt.
In Moscow, Solzhenitsyn's wife,
Natalya Svetlova, said she spoke with
her husband for about 15 minutes. She
said he told her he was all right after
his 26-hour ordeal that began when
secret police muscled into their
apartment Tuesday night and dragged
him away.
She said Solzhenitsyn told her he
was escorted by eight men on the
Soviet jetliner that brought him
involuntarily to Germany.
Frankfurt Arrival
Regarded in the West as the greatest
living Russian author, Solzhenitsyn
arrived at Frankfurt airport in late
afternoon. Newsmen were barred from
approaching the plane which taxied to
a far station on the tarmac.
Only one person met the author in
Frankfurt. Gerlinde Kutschera, an
airport employee who had learned that
Solzhenitsyn was aboard the plane,
rushed to the ramp and handed him a
single rose as he deplaned.
The last Soviet citizen of equal
prominence to be forcibly deported
was Leon Trotsky, who was thrust
across the Turkish border in 1929
after losing a power struggle with Josef
Stalin.
The Soviet news agency Tass
announced in Moscow that the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's parliament, had stripped the
author of his citizenship "for
performing systematically actions that
are incompatible with being a citizen
of the U.S.S.R. and detrimental to the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
It added he was exiled yesterday
and that his family will be allowed to
join him "when they deem it
necessary."
Campaign
Solzhenitsyn's arrest and expulsion
from the Soviet Union climaxed a
campaign of criticism and abuse in the

Soviet press, radio and television
following publication in the West of
The Gulag Archipelago, two months
ago.
The book, an account of the
Stalinist concentration camp system,
under which Solzhenitsyn had spent
eight years as a prisoner, traced the
origins of camp terror to Vladimir I.
Lenin, founder of the Soviet state and
revered by the nation's present leaders.
The West German government
announced that it had been informed
in advance by the Kremlin that
Solzhenitsyn would be coming to
Germany, and spokesman Ruediger
von Wechmar said the country was
prepared to accept him.
Nobel Prize-winning author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, banished
from his own country yesterday, has
been offered an invitation to come to
Stanford.
A telegram signed by University
President Richard W. Lyman and
Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell offered "to facilitate your
work and to accommodate you and
your family here."
Lyman was in Washington, D.C. last
night and reportedly approved the
telegram by telephone. Campbell,
reached at his Los Altos Hills home,
would say only that he would be "very

pleased" to have a man of
Solzhenitsyn's stature at the Hoover
Institution.
The telegram was dispatched
yesterday to the Soviet dissident in
care of Heinrich 8011, the West
German Nobel laureate with whom he
is staying.

hoped that the offer would cause no
embarrassment for Solzhenitsyn or his
family, which remains in the Soviet
Union.
Stanford was for many years the
home of another famous Russian
exile: Alexander Kerensky, who
headed the provisional government
that replaced Czar Nicholas II in 1917
and was in turn toppled by the

Bolsheviks later that year. Kerensky
died in 1970 at the age of 89.
New Life
Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn himself,
tired and stunned, arrived in
Langenbroich, West Germany, to begin
his new life in exile.
"Now I simply have to collect
myself and to understand my
situation," he told newsmen before
telephoning his wife in Moscow.
He made his brief remarks in the
courtyard of Boll's country retreat in
the rolling Eifel Mountains,
Solzhenitsyn's first haven outside the
Soviet Union.
"You understand, I am very tired. I
am worried. I am worried about my
family . . said the 55-year-old
author. He brushed aside any
questions.
He added he would refuse
interviews for several days.
He said he first learned he was to be
expelled at 1 p.m. Moscow time
yesterday, about two hours before the
scheduled departure of the flight for
Frankfurt.
In Moscow, Solzhenitsyn's wife,
Natalya Svetlova, said she spoke with
her husband for about 15 minutes. She
said he told her he was all right after
his 26-hour ordeal that began when
secret police muscled into their
apartment Tuesday night and dragged
him away.
She said Solzhenitsyn told her he
was escorted by eight men on the
Soviet jetliner that brought him
involuntarily to Germany.
Frankfurt Arrival
Regarded in the West as the greatest
living Russian author, Solzhenitsyn
arrived at Frankfurt airport in late
afternoon. Newsmen were barred from
approaching the plane which taxied to
a far station on the tarmac.
Only one person met the author in
Frankfurt. Gerlinde Kutschera, an
airport employee who had learned that
Solzhenitsyn was aboard the plane,
rushed to the ramp and handed him a
single rose as he deplaned.
The last Soviet citizen of equal
prominence to be forcibly deported
was Leon Trotsky, who was thrust
across the Turkish border in 1929
after losing a power struggle with Josef
Stalin.
The Soviet news agency Tass
announced in Moscow that the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's parliament, had stripped the
author of his citizenship "for
performing systematically actions that
are incompatible with being a citizen
of the U.S.S.R. and detrimental to the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
It added he was exiled yesterday
and that his family will be allowed to
join him "when they deem it
necessary."
Campaign
Solzhenitsyn's arrest and expulsion
from the Soviet Union climaxed a
campaign of criticism and abuse in the

Soviet press, radio and television
following publication in the West of
The Gulag Archipelago, two months
ago.
The book, an account of the
Stalinist concentration camp system,
under which Solzhenitsyn had spent
eight years as a prisoner, traced the
origins of camp terror to Vladimir I.
Lenin, founder of the Soviet state and
revered by the nation's present leaders.
The West German government
announced that it had been informed
in advance by the Kremlin that
Solzhenitsyn would be coming to
Germany, and spokesman Ruediger
von Wechmar said the country was
prepared to accept him.
Nobel Prize-winning author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, banished
from his own country yesterday, has
been offered an invitation to come to
Stanford.
A telegram signed by University
President Richard W. Lyman and
Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell offered "to facilitate your
work and to accommodate you and
your family here."
Lyman was in Washington, D.C. last
night and reportedly approved the
telegram by telephone. Campbell,
reached at his Los Altos Hills home,
would say only that he would be "very

pleased" to have a man of
Solzhenitsyn's stature at the Hoover
Institution.
The telegram was dispatched
yesterday to the Soviet dissident in
care of Heinrich 8011, the West
German Nobel laureate with whom he
is staying.

Assoc. History Prof. Terence
Emmons told the Daily last night that
he, Slavic Prof. Edward J. Brown and
History Prof. Alexander Dallin first
proposed the idea yesterday.
Emmons said he contacted
Campbell while Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig talked to Lyman. The

telegram itself was sent late yesterday
afternoon.
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace contains an
extensive collection of material on
Soviet history, a subject which has
provided the basis for many of
Solzhenitsyn's works, including One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich —
his only work to be published in his
own country — and the recently-issued
The Gulag Archipelago.
Lyman said from Washington last
night that he thinks that Solzhenitsyn
is "aware of the richness" of the
Hoover material.
Goodwill
Asked whether the telegram was a
goodwill gesture or a firm offer,
Lyman said it was "somewhere in
between." He noted, however, that the
offer was indeed a goodwill gesture "in
the most profound sense of that
term."
Lyman added that he was
