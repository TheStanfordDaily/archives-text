# Hearst Can't Meet Kidnapers' Demands
## 
### 
BERKELEY (AP) — Newspaper
magnate Randolph A. Hearst said
yesterday he could not possibly meet
the demand of his daughter's
kidnapers for a multimillion-dollar
food giveaway.
But he sought to assure his
daughter and her abductors by vowing
to do "everything in my power" to set
up some kind of food distribution
program. To 19-year-old Patricia
Hearst, he said: in there,
honey!"
Later, Charles Bates, the FBI agent
in charge of the kidnaping case, said he
had "never seen anything good come
out of compromising with a bunch of
hoods." Bates said he had no
disagreement with the position of the
Hearst family in seeking to meet the
kidnapers' demands.
However, Bates, who called this the
first political kidnaping he knew of in
the United States, said he doubted
granting the kidnapers' demands
would gain Miss Hearst's freedom. He
said, "I think the chances are good
that one demand would follow
another forever."
Hearst first told reporters that it
was impossible to meet the kidnapers'
demand — estimated by state officials
to cost as much as $400 million — and
said he would make a counter proposal
within two days. Later, however, he
appeared again outside his
Hillsborough home to say that he
would try to meet their demands —
but on a modified scale.
"I believe the important thing for
them to know is that I am going to do
everything I can to comply with their
demand, and if that's not enough, I
can't help it. I've done everything I

can do," he said.
The kidnapers demanded that $70
worth of meats, vegetables and dairy
foods be handed out over a four-week
period starting Monday to "all people
with welfare cards, social security
pension cards, disabled veteran cards,
parole or probation papers and jail or
release slips."
Finally, newspaper, radio and
television stations throughout
California were flooded with persons
who said they wanted no part of any
food that was "blood money" for
negotiating the release of the coed.
