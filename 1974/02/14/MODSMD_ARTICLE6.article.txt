# 'Chinese Life Better'

"Living conditions in the People's
Republic of China seem modest by our
standards, but they are amazingly
improved over those I saw there 25
years ago," Aeronautics Prof.
Chi-Chang Chao said yesterday in a
lecture at Skilling Auditorium.
Chao was one of seven professors
from California universities who
visited China last summer. Born in
China, Chao received his
undergraduate college education at
Peking's Tsing-Hua University, but has
lived in the United States for over 20
years.
"At a fruit-growing commune we
visited, the workers received a
monthly salary of about $8 per
month, plus one or two small rooms
and a ration of food," Chao
recounted. "If they save for about two
years, they can buy a bicycle, which is
considered a rare treasure there. With a
bicycle, a man's earning power will go
up; for otherwise he must carry loads
on his back. Most people who grow up
on communes never see a car," Chao
said.
"Yet today even the simple

roadside restrooms seem impressive,
because 20 years ago any ditch in a
field was a "roadside restroom," He
continued. "We saw very few insects
where there used to be swarms of
flies."
Chao visited Tsing-Hua and Peking
Universities, where several of his
college classmates are now professors,
and gave a seminar at the Institute of
Applied Mechanics.
Maoism Accepted
"The teachers I talked to have
accepted all the Maoist indoctrination
they get as a fact of life," Chao stated.
"They are not unhappy with their life,
although they must attend weekly
political meetings and during the
'cultural revolution' they were sent to
the communes to work alongside the
peasants.
"I think that we were asked to give
seminars in order to inspire research
work, which has been lagging," Chao
noted. "The Chinese have pored their
energy into producing some very
impressive lab equipment, all Chinese
made. They always stress the practical:
for example, they didn't wish one of
