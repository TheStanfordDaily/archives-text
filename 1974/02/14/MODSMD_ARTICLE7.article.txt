## Solzhenitsyn 
### 
The arrest and exile of Nobel Prize-winning author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn is shocking to all who believe in the
ideals of free speech and human dignity.
Solzhenitsyn's sole "crime" has been to speak out against
immoral acts perpetrated by his government. For this, he has
been unmercifully harassed and has been the victim of a
vicious official campaign designed to discredit him and his
books. The campaign culminated Tuesday when he was
forcibly removed from his wife's Moscow apartment by
Soviet police and then deported to West Germany.
We can only applaud the courage of this man, who has
undergone such hardships because his conscience demanded
that he not remain silent. And we also commend the prompt
action taken yesterday by President Lyman and Hoover
Institute Director W. Glenn Campbell in offering to
accommodate Solzhenitsyn should he wish to come to
Stanford to continue his work. A man such as Alexander
Solzhenitsyn deserves all the support the world can muster.
