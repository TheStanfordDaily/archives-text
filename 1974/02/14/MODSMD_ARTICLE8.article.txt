# Jackson In '76?

On Feb. 8, the New York
Times ran a story headlined,
"Jackson Up Front in 1976
Pack." During October of last
year, the Los Angeles Times put a
headline on Joseph Kraft's
column that conveyed a similar
message: "Jackson Emerges as
Most Powerful Democrat."
Since he is now a leading
candidate for the Democratic
nomination, careful attention
should be paid to Henry Jackson's
principles and to his stands on
current issues.
Jackson, D-Wash., is in the
public eye these days as head of
the Senate permanent
subcommittee on investigations,
which is currently studying the
problems of fuel supplies.
Although Jackson is giving oil
company spokesmen a difficult
time at the hearings, there is
evidence that this posture is a
matter of political expediency.
Views Were Compatible
Before this, the oil industry
had considered Jackson's views
compatible with the industry's. As
the New York Times noted on
Jan. 25:"The industry's anger
appeared to be directed at
Jackson to some extent because it
felt he had changed his position
on the energy situation and its
causes. .. .
■ "In the past the industry had
generally praised Jackson on his
informed, low-keyed approach
toward the nation's energy
difficulties."
Jackson's closeness to the oil
industry was also manifested by
Gulf Oil's $10,000 contribution
to his 1972 Presidential campaign.
Nicknamed "the Senator from
Boeing," Jackson has a consistent
record of favoring new weapons
sytems and new military
technology and is therefore
favorably regarded by the
munitions industries and labor
unions.
Cold War Hawk
In foreign policy, Jackson is a
Cold War hawk. He strongly
supported American military
intervention in Vietnam. He has
strongly supported American aid
to Israel.
On domestic policy matters,
the positions taken by Jackson
have increased his political clout.
As Kraft puts it:"(Jackson) has
accumulated the kind of power
that comes from assiduous service
to a vast array of client interests
over more than 30 years."
Jackson has been able to
provide services to his political
clients by advocating ideologically

and working legislatively for
expansions of the power of the
U.S. government.
Jackson has provided
numerous mechanisms whereby
the taxpayers are forced to pay
the costs of industries. The most
recent is the $20-billion energy
research program that he
encouraged the Senate to approve
last autumn.
Jackson's Votes Reviewed
A review of some of Jackson's
votes in the Senate last year helps
to fill in the already-outlined
picture we have of Jackson.
On March 19, he voted to place
directly in the President's hands
authority to establish priorities of
use and an allocation system of
supplies of petroleum products,
thus increasng the centralization
of power in the government.
On April 3, he voted for
increased and mandatory penalties
for salesmen of drugs who are not
themselves drug-users, thus
worsening the harm done by
victimless crime laws.
On April 30, he backed the
effort of Sen. Hubert Humphrey,
D—Minn., and other Cold
Warriors, to increase
appropriations to the United
States Information Agency, the
government's foreign propaganda
arm.
Supported Subsidies
On June 7, he voted against
ending subsidies to farm interests
and ending crop-by-crop
allotments. Orv the same day, he
voted against ending the
protectionist quota on dairy
goods imports.
On June 26, he voted to
increase the authorization for
foreign military aid from $270
million to $652 million. On the
same day, he voted against
phasing out the military aid
program over the next few years.
On June 27, he voted against
the Eagleton amendment which
barred the use of any U.S. funds
to support military activities in
Laos and Cambodia.
On July 27, he voted to bail
out the bankrupt railroad
companies.
These few examples taken
from the first half of 1973 show
that Jackson is quintessentially a
Truman-style Democrat, favoring
increased U.S. government
intervention in the lives of
foreigners and of American
citizens.
