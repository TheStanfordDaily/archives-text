# Stanford Group Isolates Drug Addiction Molecule
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
A group of Stanford Medical Center
scientists have isolated for the first
time brain molecules known as "opiate
receptors" which are believed to be
crucial in understanding drug
addiction and new ways of dealing
with it.
News of the discovery, announced
by Pharmacology Prof. Avram
Goldstein at a Medical School press
conference yesterday, will be
published today in Science, the journal
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
Drugs must combine with such
receptor molecules in order to act on
any cell of the body, "like keys fitting
into their proper locks," Goldstein
said.

"To explain, drugs work by
interacting with specific molecules in
brain cells or cell membranes. This
combination triggers a chemical event
that leads to what we call drug action.
These special molecules are the
receptors to which narcotic drugs fit."
Pain Relief
Goldstein hypothesized that the
receptor isolated may be involved in
pain-killing effects because it is present
principally in the part of the brain
known to carry out pain relief. "This
is the lower part of the brain stem
called rhombencephalon," he added.
The research team included
Goldstein, senior research assistant
Louise I. Lowney, and Karin Schulz
and Patricia J. Lowery, research
assistants in the Department of
pharmacology. Goldstein, an authority
on drug addiction, directs the
Addiction Research Foundation in
Palo Alto. He also inaugurated the
Santa Clara County methadone
program which has treated about 1200
addicts since 1970.
Mouse Brains
The brain molecules, called opiate
receptors because they combine with
morphine (one of a class of
compounds derived from opium), were
isolated in a study of mouse brain
fragments which began several years

ago. The body converts the heroin
taken by an addict into morphine, and
the morphine acts on nerve cells.
Goldstein termed his research part
of a field "of great public concern
where social policy is being made on
the basis of extremely little scientific
understanding of the problem. We
tend to think of heroin addiction as a
disease but we don't know what kind
of a disease."
Irreversible Change
"There is some evidence that heroin
addicts may have some real abnormal
function in their brains," Goldstein
said. "It is even possible that through
repeated use of narcotics the drug
receptors in brain cells are changed in
some irreversible fashion either in their
structure and function or through the
biochemical system of which they are
a part.
"If we understood these changes in
receptors — assuming they occur — we
might have the basis for a new
approach to the treatment of
addiction," he suggested.
Isolation
Goldstein compared the isolation of
opiate receptors with the
identification of the tuberculosis
bacteria. When research on these
molecules is more complete, "we
might find a way of curing drug
addiction," he said.
"With better knowledge of opiate
receptors we might make progress in
another area," Goldstein added. "If we
could show, for example, any
differences between receptors that
mediate pain-killing and those
mediating gratifying-euphoric effects,
we could develop new nonaddictive
opium-like pain-killing drugs."
Although the team's findings were
limited to the discovery of the opiate
receptors in a mouse brain, Goldstein
suggested that "very similar molecules
are almost certainly involved in human
narcotic addiction."
Goldstein noted yesterday that he
will continue his research after the end
of the academic year at the Palo Alto
Addiction Research Foundation, a
non-profit organization independent
of the University. He cited
disadvantages of "bureaucratic
structure in which it is difficult to get
things done" and a "loss of control
from faculty to administrators," as
reasons for the move.

ISOLATION BREAKTHROUGH — Pharmacology Prof. Avram Goldstein holds a molecular model of an opiate related to
morphine, used in isolating an "opiate receptor" from brain tissue for the first time. Members of the research team
pictured above are (left to right), Louise I. Lowney, Patricia J. Lowery, and Karin Schulz. The discovery may help unravel
the mysteries of narcotics addiction.
