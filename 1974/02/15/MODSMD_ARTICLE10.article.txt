First Step Taken
Editor:
Contrary to John Freed's
article Monday, I did not leave the
Union for Radical Political
Economics (URPE) meeting last
Friday bitter or confused. Rather
I was surprised and pleased at the
faculty's response to the student
proposals.
Obviously, the decision by the
faculty did not adequately deal
with any of the student proposals,
but the decision was an obvious
gain; an indication of the desire
by both the faculty and students
to improve the economic
department. At least one-half of
the faculty supported the student
proposals. I wish to express my
appreciation to those faculty
members receptive to student
concerns.
However two crucial issues on
the undergraduate level were
ignored. First is the original
demand for three faculty working
in and sympathetic to Marxian
and radical economics. The
second issue relates to the need
for student input to the
committee reorganizing the
undergraduate economics
curriculum.
Bilateral respect between
students and faculty and a
willingness to listen to one
another can only lead to a better
understanding of both groups'
needs. "The journey of a
thousand miles starts with a single
step." The faculty has taken that
"first step."
Lynn Rosener
Senior, Economics
The Daily's Course
Editor:
The irresponsible and
degenerating course of your
newspaper troubles me. The
downward trend seems to have
begun perhaps a year or so ago.
Small questions began to nag at
me: e.g., why were mindless
inanities like Jerry Coleman's
"Highschool Madness" published
on the Opinions Page? Maybe it's
a bad case of McCarthyism on my
part, but the appearance of his
drivel on the editorial page always
led me to question the credibility

of anything else appearing on that
page.
Then you had the audacity to
print Claire Spiegel's article on Mr.
Chang (the nature of which was
questionable anyway) on the
front page of your paper, when
the article contained a quote from
the subject stating his aversion to
publicity.
Then the Streakers — again
front page "news." It's enough to
make one go out and stir up
trouble just to provide you with
real news to report. I was also
tempted to write a letter under
the guise of an irate parent who
didn't want such degrading and
chauvinistic material entering her
house where her children could
etc., etc., etc.
For the nadir of your
insensitivity and bad taste,
though, we had to wait for
Spiegel's report on cadavers. She
(and the editor who allowed her
article to be published) displayed
remarkable disrespect and
callousness. Spiegel's puns and
sensationalistic details were
inexcusable and disgusting. It's as
though you are trying to beat the
Chronicle at its own game.

Wrestling Coverage
Editor:
Wow! You mean Stanford has
a wrestling team; One wouldn't
know it if he had been reading the
Daily in past years. In fact, I was a
member of the team for the last
two years — but if it weren't for
direct participation, I never would
have had knowledge of coach Joe
DeMeo's wrestling team.
The articles in the past two
years on the sport can be counted
on one hand. B'lt this year,
something snapped and someone
finally realized that sports besides
the "biggies" truly exist.
Your recent coverage of
wrestling has been great. I just
hope you keep it up and also let
your readers in on the details of
the other non-"biggies." What
creates interest is interest itself.

"Highschool Madness" published
on the Opinions Page? Maybe it's
a bad case of McCarthyism on my
part, but the appearance of his
drivel on the editorial page always
led me to question the credibility

of anything else appearing on that
page.
Then you had the audacity to
print Claire Spiegel's article on Mr.
Chang (the nature of which was
questionable anyway) on the
front page of your paper, when
the article contained a quote from
the subject stating his aversion to
publicity.
Then the Streakers — again
front page "news." It's enough to
make one go out and stir up
trouble just to provide you with
real news to report. I was also
tempted to write a letter under
the guise of an irate parent who
didn't want such degrading and
chauvinistic material entering her
house where her children could
etc., etc., etc.
For the nadir of your
insensitivity and bad taste,
though, we had to wait for
Spiegel's report on cadavers. She
(and the editor who allowed her
article to be published) displayed
remarkable disrespect and
callousness. Spiegel's puns and
sensationalistic details were
inexcusable and disgusting. It's as
though you are trying to beat the
Chronicle at its own game.

Wow! You mean Stanford has
a wrestling team; One wouldn't
know it if he had been reading the
Daily in past years. In fact, I was a
member of the team for the last
two years — but if it weren't for
direct participation, I never would
have had knowledge of coach Joe
DeMeo's wrestling team.
The articles in the past two
years on the sport can be counted
on one hand. B'lt this year,
something snapped and someone
finally realized that sports besides
the "biggies" truly exist.
Your recent coverage of
wrestling has been great. I just
hope you keep it up and also let
your readers in on the details of
the other non-"biggies." What
creates interest is interest itself.

Contrary to John Freed's
article Monday, I did not leave the
Union for Radical Political
Economics (URPE) meeting last
Friday bitter or confused. Rather
I was surprised and pleased at the
faculty's response to the student
proposals.
Obviously, the decision by the
faculty did not adequately deal
with any of the student proposals,
but the decision was an obvious
gain; an indication of the desire
by both the faculty and students
to improve the economic
department. At least one-half of
the faculty supported the student
proposals. I wish to express my
appreciation to those faculty
members receptive to student
concerns.
However two crucial issues on
the undergraduate level were
ignored. First is the original
demand for three faculty working
in and sympathetic to Marxian
and radical economics. The
second issue relates to the need
for student input to the
committee reorganizing the
undergraduate economics
curriculum.
Bilateral respect between
students and faculty and a
willingness to listen to one
another can only lead to a better
understanding of both groups'
needs. "The journey of a
thousand miles starts with a single
step." The faculty has taken that
"first step."
