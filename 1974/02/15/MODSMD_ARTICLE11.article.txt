# Mayor's Goals
## 
### 
(The Daily asked Mayor Comstock
of Palo Alto to comment on his
goals for the future relationship
of Stanford and Palo Alto.)
My goals for Palo
Alto-Stanford relations in 1974
are for evolutionary rather than
revolutionary changes. I believe
that the city and the University
may be proud of the progress of
the past year but the old doctrine
of "what have we done for you
lately" still prevails. (Good old
Future-Shock.)
What are some of the
evolutionary changes? Let's start
with housekeeping. The city and
the University can, and should, go
a great deal further in integrating
"municipal services." All the
functions of road maintenance,
fire protection, policing, etc., now
operate with dual overhead. There
is great potential for better service
and cost control.
The second tier of interest or
concern would include services of
a social orientation, i.e., child-care
(sometimes a problem in town
too), recreation, library services,
arts and theater, drug abuse
correction. These are expensive in
any event and yet both
institutions have unique assets.
How about "home and home"
performances between Dinkelspiel
and Community Theater of
Stanford productions and
Palo Alto Theater productions?
Rotating art exhibits? (We'd love

Kirke Comstock I
Goya for a week at the Cultural
Center.)
Another area of involvement
that must improve is coordination
and consideration between City
and University on commercial and
industrial developments. We need
to tie Downtown Palo Alto and
the Stanford Shopping Center
together so that they are
reinforcing . The worst course to
follow would be to try to create
both things in both places.
Finally, I want to see more
disagreement come out in the
open now that we have shown we
can handle it as we did the "cs"
zoning issue. The most valuable
outgrowth of that event was that
Stanford learned that thf city has
legitimate concerns, is flexible,
and is not an "enemy;" while the
city learned even more fully that
the University has legitimate
concerns, is flexible and is not an
"enemy." 1 believe that the stage
is now set for the city and the
University to discuss and resolvp
some land use issues of very long
standing and lay to rest a large
number of old and tired
"bogeymen."
I cannot close without saying
that I also have a goal that I hope
I will be able to read even more
about the City of Palo Alto in the
Daily and hear more about Palo
Alto on KZSU; both parties
are already doing a very good job.
