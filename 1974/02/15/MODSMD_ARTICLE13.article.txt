# Support Emeriti On Row
## 
### 
Lloyd Snook I

Jim Wascher's Tuesday column
made the mistake of lumping me
and Jim Friend together on the
emeritus faculty housing project.
Why, Wascher asked, did I, as a
student member of the Trustees'
Land and Buildings Committee,
not object to the Mayfield Avenue
site before the Trustees passed the
proposal?
Briefly, because I supported
the project. After some study, I
concluded that Mayfield Avenue
would make a good site for
faculty apartments. Jim Friend
couldn't have had me express his
objections even could I have
attended the Trustees' January
meeting, because I didn't share
them.
I do have some reservations
about the proposal. I am
concerned that there hasn't been a
recent, specific study to
determine the need for 100 units
of housing on Mayfield. However,
if a good survey can show a need
for the planned project, 1 would
fully support the Mayfield site,
for the following reasons:
—It is clearly a convenient
location, and older faculty will
need apartments near the central
campus to be within the easy
walking distance that they tend to
need, and that they deserve.
—Hurlburt House is being
moved anyway, to make room for
a straightened Campus Drive (an
important step in the
rationalization of Stanford's
traffic pattern).
—Stanford doesn't intend to
destroy the Row as a center for
student housing. The University is
committed to moving Hurlburt to
save it, and to returning the
Center for Inter-Disciplinary
Research (next to Kairos) to
student housing by September,
1975. There is also a plan now
being studied by the staff that
would recreate the Row on both
sides of Lasuen, between Grove
House and Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The old architecture
would be preserved, because the
new Row would be made by
moving the old houses.
—Whether there was
"adequate" student input depends
on your definition of "adequate,"
but in no case does inadequate
student input mean that the
decision that came out was wrong.
Even staff and faculty have been
known to make intelligent
decisions without the students'
help. You may quarrel with the
procedures used, but the
important thing is the conclusion
reached.
If the conclusion is a good,
well-reasoned one (as I believe this
one is), then you shouldn't veto
the decision just because you
didn't like the procedures. Last
week's referendum confused the
two issues, by asking students to
vote not on the merits of the
proposal, but on how it was
reached.
—Students and faculty need
not be incompatible. If faculty
neighbors can be believed, Jim
Friend is nowhere near as
obnoxious a neighbor as he
fancies himself. There will
obviously be a difference in the
lifestyles of students and faculty,
but hardly a "conflict."
—The University has stipulated
that the plans must show that the
project will fit in well with the
residential neighborhood. I believe
Vice-Provost Ed Shaw when he
promises that no plans will get
past him if they would destroy
the environment of Mayfield
Avenue.
Communication Failure
It is unfortunate that the issue
was so poorly handled. The
University should have gone out
of its way to communicate with
students, and it didn't. Ed Shaw
has agreed to consult with Row
residents when the plans come in,
to make sure they're acceptable.
It is also unfortunate that there
was a referendum at all. Jim
Friend, having blown his chance
to register his objections,
organized a referendum on an
issue on which very few students
were informed. (Most of those
voting didn't even know there was
an election until the day before.)
Jim did a good job of overnight
political organizing, but the vote
is hardly valid as a poll of
informed student opinion. I agree
with Jim Wascher's charges of
"egoism ... and hypocrisy."
I hope that University officials
will get on with their review of
the decision, and that they make a
valid showing of need, by a group
including students, ignoring last
week's referendum. This is a
decision that requires responsible,
informed student input.

would recreate the Row on both

House and Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The old architecture
would be preserved, because the

moving the old houses.
—Whether there was
"adequate" student input depends
on your definition of "adequate,"
but in no case does inadequate
student input mean that the
decision that came out was wrong.
Even staff and faculty have been
known to make intelligent
decisions without the students'
help. You may quarrel with the
procedures used, but the
important thing is the conclusion
reached.
If the conclusion is a good,
well-reasoned one (as I believe this
one is), then you shouldn't veto
the decision just because you
didn't like the procedures. Last
week's referendum confused the
two issues, by asking students to
vote not on the merits of the
proposal, but on how it was
reached.
—Students and faculty need
not be incompatible. If faculty
neighbors can be believed, Jim
Friend is nowhere near as
obnoxious a neighbor as he
fancies himself. There will
obviously be a difference in the
lifestyles of students and faculty,
but hardly a "conflict."
—The University has stipulated
that the plans must show that the
project will fit in well with the
residential neighborhood. I believe
Vice-Provost Ed Shaw when he
promises that no plans will get
past him if they would destroy
the environment of Mayfield
Avenue.
Communication Failure
It is unfortunate that the issue
was so poorly handled. The
University should have gone out
of its way to communicate with
students, and it didn't. Ed Shaw
has agreed to consult with Row
residents when the plans come in,
to make sure they're acceptable.
It is also unfortunate that there
was a referendum at all. Jim
Friend, having blown his chance
to register his objections,
organized a referendum on an
issue on which very few students
were informed. (Most of those
voting didn't even know there was
an election until the day before.)
Jim did a good job of overnight
political organizing, but the vote
is hardly valid as a poll of
informed student opinion. I agree
with Jim Wascher's charges of
"egoism ... and hypocrisy."
I hope that University officials
will get on with their review of
the decision, and that they make a
valid showing of need, by a group
including students, ignoring last
week's referendum. This is a
decision that requires responsible,
informed student input.

Jim Wascher's Tuesday column
made the mistake of lumping me
and Jim Friend together on the
emeritus faculty housing project.
Why, Wascher asked, did I, as a
student member of the Trustees'
Land and Buildings Committee,
not object to the Mayfield Avenue
site before the Trustees passed the
proposal?
Briefly, because I supported
the project. After some study, I
concluded that Mayfield Avenue
would make a good site for
faculty apartments. Jim Friend
couldn't have had me express his
objections even could I have
attended the Trustees' January
meeting, because I didn't share
them.
I do have some reservations
about the proposal. I am
concerned that there hasn't been a
recent, specific study to
determine the need for 100 units
of housing on Mayfield. However,
if a good survey can show a need
for the planned project, 1 would
fully support the Mayfield site,
for the following reasons:
—It is clearly a convenient
location, and older faculty will
need apartments near the central
campus to be within the easy
walking distance that they tend to
need, and that they deserve.
—Hurlburt House is being
moved anyway, to make room for
a straightened Campus Drive (an
important step in the
rationalization of Stanford's
traffic pattern).
—Stanford doesn't intend to
destroy the Row as a center for
student housing. The University is
committed to moving Hurlburt to
save it, and to returning the
Center for Inter-Disciplinary
Research (next to Kairos) to
student housing by September,
1975. There is also a plan now

Communication Failure
It is unfortunate that the issue
was so poorly handled. The
University should have gone out
of its way to communicate with
students, and it didn't. Ed Shaw
has agreed to consult with Row
residents when the plans come in,
to make sure they're acceptable.
It is also unfortunate that there
was a referendum at all. Jim
Friend, having blown his chance
to register his objections,
organized a referendum on an
issue on which very few students
were informed. (Most of those
voting didn't even know there was
an election until the day before.)
Jim did a good job of overnight
political organizing, but the vote
is hardly valid as a poll of
informed student opinion. I agree
with Jim Wascher's charges of
"egoism ... and hypocrisy."
I hope that University officials
will get on with their review of
the decision, and that they make a
valid showing of need, by a group
including students, ignoring last
week's referendum. This is a
decision that requires responsible,
informed student input.
