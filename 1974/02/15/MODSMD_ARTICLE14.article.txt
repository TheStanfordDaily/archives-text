# Babbling Brook, Hanging Ivy, Live Doves
## S.F. Hotel Features Interior Ecology 
### PAUL YEUELL 
SAN FRANCISCO - The
Hyatt Regency Hotel in San
Francisco, designed by John
Portman, embodies two
controversial concepts in design;
architecture as entertainment, and
hotel as pleasure machine. And
with these comes a completely
new field for experts — massive
interior ecology.
The mammoth mid-town hotel,
no less than striking from the
outside, envelops a huge 17
story "atrium." Inside, each guest
room opens onto a balcony which
overlooks a vast interior ecology
of plants, animals, and people.
To bring the outside inside,
Portman filled the huge cavity —
170 feet high, 170 wide and 300
feet long — with over 100 full-size
trees, over 1500 hanging ivy
plants, a "babbling brook" that
flows gently along a row of indoor
shops on the plaza, a four-story
sculpture which floats above a
mirror-like pool, live caged doves,
a stereophonic "sound sculpture"
of birds flitting about with forty

hidden speakers, and open-air
lounges and calm eddies of
over-stuffed arm chairs.
However, in planning a hotel
complex like this, certain
elements are unpredictable, such
as how guests will deal with the
new environment. Since the hotel
opened in May, there have been
over 300 accidents involving
people looking up, instead of at
whatever they were stepping off
of or into.
Modifications have been made
to meet the guest responses. To
remedy this particular problem,
general manager Don Deporter has
had to install guard rails on the
various sunken steps that were
proving to be too subtle for the
guests.
Deporter has had to modify
Portman's original plan in other
ways. In the coffee lounge on the
plaza, the distinction between the
inside of the lounge and the plaza

outside was too subtle for some to
recognize.
"They were stepping over the
low wall and into the lounge,"
says Deporter. So Deporte*-
reinforced the boundary of «ne
lounge with flowers, utilizing
chrysanthemums for pedestrian
traffic control.
Another modification that
Deporter made was to stock the
"babbling brook" with Coy carp,
fish costing $25 each. "They were
supposed to be suited to this
environment," says Deporter.
In the design of the San
Francisco Regency are certain
features to discourage forms of
inappropriate behavior that have
been a problem at the Atlanta
Hyatt Regency, another of
Portman's space age hoteis
featuring the "atrium" design.
There, the most dramatic problem
is suicide.
So far, a half dozen people

have taken their own lives inside
the Atlanta Hyatt Regency. In his
San Francisco version, Portman
has placed trees, chairs and other
obstacles beneath the balconies in
the belief that jumpers prefer a
clean impact and will be
discouraged by something that
may break their fall. To date, no
one has leaped from the newest
Regency.
In addition to adjusting the
building to the guests' responses,
Deporter maintains the delicate
ecological balance in the giant
"atrium." Essentially, he has
become an expert on massive
indoor horticulture.
To give the scale for the size of
this operation, Deporter explains
that the hotel spends $80,000 a
year on maintaining the flowers
alone. They use over 12,000
"mums" a month.
There are three sets of small
trees in the plaza, each of which

spends three weeks at a time on
the plaza floor. Then they are
replaced by a fresh set and
trucked off to rehabilitate in a
Half Moon Bay greenhouse for six
weeks.
Portman has designed into the
San Francisco Hyatt Regency
total environmental control.
Atmosphere and lighting are
subtly varied in accordance with
the time of day.
The stereophonic system that
plays the sound of birds taking
off, fluttering by and singing can
be modified to suit the guests. For
example, cows munching and
mooing could be arranged for a
dairy farmers association. Or
loaded rigs could thunder through
the plaza for truckers.
To sum up the responses of the
guests, Deporter describes a
common reaction. "The most
frequently muttered phrase," says
Deporter, "is 'son of a bitch.' "

with these comes a completely
new field for experts — massive
interior ecology.
The mammoth mid-town hotel,
no less than striking from the
outside, envelops a huge 17
story "atrium." Inside, each guest
room opens onto a balcony which
overlooks a vast interior ecology
of plants, animals, and people.
To bring the outside inside,
Portman filled the huge cavity —
170 feet high, 170 wide and 300
feet long — with over 100 full-size
trees, over 1500 hanging ivy
plants, a "babbling brook" that
flows gently along a row of indoor
shops on the plaza, a four-story
sculpture which floats above a
mirror-like pool, live caged doves,
a stereophonic "sound sculpture"
of birds flitting about with forty

hidden speakers, and open-air
lounges and calm eddies of
over-stuffed arm chairs.
However, in planning a hotel
complex like this, certain
elements are unpredictable, such
as how guests will deal with the
new environment. Since the hotel
opened in May, there have been
over 300 accidents involving
people looking up, instead of at
whatever they were stepping off
of or into.
Modifications have been made
to meet the guest responses. To
remedy this particular problem,
general manager Don Deporter has
had to install guard rails on the
various sunken steps that were
proving to be too subtle for the
guests.
Deporter has had to modify
Portman's original plan in other
ways. In the coffee lounge on the
plaza, the distinction between the
inside of the lounge and the plaza

outside was too subtle for some to
recognize.
"They were stepping over the
low wall and into the lounge,"
says Deporter. So Deporte*-
reinforced the boundary of «ne
lounge with flowers, utilizing
chrysanthemums for pedestrian
traffic control.
Another modification that
Deporter made was to stock the
"babbling brook" with Coy carp,
fish costing $25 each. "They were
supposed to be suited to this
environment," says Deporter.
In the design of the San
Francisco Regency are certain
features to discourage forms of
inappropriate behavior that have
been a problem at the Atlanta
Hyatt Regency, another of
Portman's space age hoteis
featuring the "atrium" design.
There, the most dramatic problem
is suicide.
So far, a half dozen people

have taken their own lives inside
the Atlanta Hyatt Regency. In his
San Francisco version, Portman
has placed trees, chairs and other
obstacles beneath the balconies in
the belief that jumpers prefer a
clean impact and will be
discouraged by something that
may break their fall. To date, no
one has leaped from the newest
Regency.
In addition to adjusting the
building to the guests' responses,
Deporter maintains the delicate
ecological balance in the giant
"atrium." Essentially, he has
become an expert on massive
indoor horticulture.
To give the scale for the size of
this operation, Deporter explains
that the hotel spends $80,000 a
year on maintaining the flowers
alone. They use over 12,000
"mums" a month.
There are three sets of small
trees in the plaza, each of which

spends three weeks at a time on
the plaza floor. Then they are
replaced by a fresh set and
trucked off to rehabilitate in a
Half Moon Bay greenhouse for six
weeks.
Portman has designed into the
San Francisco Hyatt Regency
total environmental control.
Atmosphere and lighting are
subtly varied in accordance with
the time of day.
The stereophonic system that
plays the sound of birds taking
off, fluttering by and singing can
be modified to suit the guests. For
example, cows munching and
mooing could be arranged for a
dairy farmers association. Or
loaded rigs could thunder through
the plaza for truckers.
To sum up the responses of the
guests, Deporter describes a
common reaction. "The most
frequently muttered phrase," says
Deporter, "is 'son of a bitch.' "

overlooks a vast interior ecology
of plants, animals, and people.
To bring the outside inside,
Portman filled the huge cavity —
170 feet high, 170 wide and 300
feet long — with over 100 full-size
trees, over 1500 hanging ivy
plants, a "babbling brook" that
flows gently along a row of indoor
shops on the plaza, a four-story
sculpture which floats above a
mirror-like pool, live caged doves,
a stereophonic "sound sculpture"
of birds flitting about with forty

hidden speakers, and open-air
lounges and calm eddies of
over-stuffed arm chairs.
However, in planning a hotel
complex like this, certain
elements are unpredictable, such
as how guests will deal with the
new environment. Since the hotel
opened in May, there have been
over 300 accidents involving
people looking up, instead of at
whatever they were stepping off
of or into.
Modifications have been made
to meet the guest responses. To
remedy this particular problem,
general manager Don Deporter has
had to install guard rails on the
various sunken steps that were
proving to be too subtle for the
guests.
Deporter has had to modify
Portman's original plan in other
ways. In the coffee lounge on the
plaza, the distinction between the
inside of the lounge and the plaza

outside was too subtle for some to
recognize.
"They were stepping over the
low wall and into the lounge,"
says Deporter. So Deporte*-
reinforced the boundary of «ne
lounge with flowers, utilizing
chrysanthemums for pedestrian
traffic control.
Another modification that
Deporter made was to stock the
"babbling brook" with Coy carp,
fish costing $25 each. "They were
supposed to be suited to this
environment," says Deporter.
In the design of the San
Francisco Regency are certain
features to discourage forms of
inappropriate behavior that have
been a problem at the Atlanta
Hyatt Regency, another of
Portman's space age hoteis
featuring the "atrium" design.
There, the most dramatic problem
is suicide.
So far, a half dozen people

have taken their own lives inside
the Atlanta Hyatt Regency. In his
San Francisco version, Portman
has placed trees, chairs and other
obstacles beneath the balconies in
the belief that jumpers prefer a
clean impact and will be
discouraged by something that
may break their fall. To date, no
one has leaped from the newest
Regency.
In addition to adjusting the
building to the guests' responses,
Deporter maintains the delicate
ecological balance in the giant
"atrium." Essentially, he has
become an expert on massive
indoor horticulture.
To give the scale for the size of
this operation, Deporter explains
that the hotel spends $80,000 a
year on maintaining the flowers
alone. They use over 12,000
"mums" a month.
There are three sets of small
trees in the plaza, each of which

spends three weeks at a time on
the plaza floor. Then they are
replaced by a fresh set and
trucked off to rehabilitate in a
Half Moon Bay greenhouse for six
weeks.
Portman has designed into the
San Francisco Hyatt Regency
total environmental control.
Atmosphere and lighting are
subtly varied in accordance with
the time of day.
The stereophonic system that
plays the sound of birds taking
off, fluttering by and singing can
be modified to suit the guests. For
example, cows munching and
mooing could be arranged for a
dairy farmers association. Or
loaded rigs could thunder through
the plaza for truckers.
To sum up the responses of the
guests, Deporter describes a
common reaction. "The most
frequently muttered phrase," says
Deporter, "is 'son of a bitch.' "


LEAFY LOBBY—The Hyatt Regency Hotel in San Francisco is an
architecthural wonderland and an ecological niche. Rooms are
situated around an enormous atrium that features trees, vines, doves,
flowers, a four story aluminum sculpture, and a lot of other unusual
furnishings.
