# 'The Alchemist' Creates Energetic Performance
## 
### MICHAEL STILLMAN 
Before the lights go down on the highly
energetic and often brilliant production of The
Alchemist now being shown at the Little Theater
(Memorial Auditorium), we have time to study a
massive wooden scene which serves as the
spectacular counterpart to those treacherously
shifting moral planes upon which Ben Jonson's
famous "comedy of humors" is founded.
Doorways give access to hidden chambers,
stairways and balconies veer away at obtuse angles,
columns intended to shore up the roof lean, this
way and that, great broken beams reach over the
audience (suggesting that we will somehow be
implicated by what happens in this fantastic place )
— and a coil of rope hangs ambiguously against a
wall as though it were a complicated snare or a
hangman's noose. Here, surely, is a house wrenched
out of frame.
Timeless Setting
Yet it turns out to be a timeless setting,
inhabited by eccentric figures still clearly
recognizable after nearly four centuries. For all
their abstraction as "humors" or "vices," they are
brought vividly to life once more in the
well-re hearsed and hard-won performances of an
excellent cast.
Usurping this house made grotesque by the
absence of authority, here is an alchemist (Subtle)
trading in pious pretenses to cozen all who can be
persuaded that his "knowledge" will bring them the
gratifications they greedily pursue. As his
confederates in the mysteries of the philosopher's
stone, here are a virtuoso harlot (Dol Common)
capable of playing a poor baron's daughter or the
Queen of Faerie and a crafty housekeeper (Face)
whose equivocations and disguises, finally
countenanced at the return of his master (Lovewit),
eventually lead to the downfall of his own
colleagues.
And as their deserving victims, here is an
impressive array of classic fools: a foppish lawyer's
clerk (Dapper), an intellectual courtier (Sir Epicure
Mammon), a self-righteous gamester (Pertinax
Surly), a shrewd pair of fundamentalist saints
(Tribulation Wholesome and Ananias), a brash
military officer (Kastril) and his lovely young
"suster," a malleable widow of nineteen (Dame
Pliant).
As the action of this great play proceeds — a
series of glittering surfaces which begin to reflect
upon each other with neoclassical intricacy —
nothing could be more subtle than the relationship
between the alchemist's uncertain art of creating
false illusions in the minds of his dupes and the
playwright's art of creating a unified illusion which
is both inevitable and true.
Dazzling Language
The key to this relationship can be found in
Jonson's dazzling language, which works for and
against his characters. Of the many strengths in this
production, the greatest lies in the attention the
actors have paid to the text; they have followed the
advice Richard Wilbur gives in the preface to his
translations from Moliere: "Trust the words."
And so the most powerful moments in The
Alchemist are those when gesture and language
reinforce each other, converge and crystallize in
such a way as to reveal Jonson's meaning.
Early in the play, Sir Epicure Mammon

(superbly acted by David Miller) creates a terrific
sense of limitless desire for wealth, power, sex —
a desire shared by most of the other characters— by
luxuriating in the most opulent (and disgusting)
speeches:
"I myself will have
The beards of barbels serv'd instead of salads,
Oil'd mushrooms, and the swelling unctuous paps
Of a fat pregnant sow, newly cut off,
Dress'd with an exquisite and poignant sauce."
The ugly narcissism of this self-indulgent fool is
multiplied endlessly in his own corrupt
imagination: "Then, my glasses/ Out in more suble
angles, to disperse/ And multiply the figures, as I
walk I Naked between my succubae."
Cross Purposes
Subtle (Bob Everding), Face (Jeff Schmidt), and
Dol Common (Susan Lichtman), consistently
played with great spirit and finesse, are especially
effective when their looks and words show that, in
spite of what they profess, they are working at
cross purposes. These strains are clear — and
virulent — when their relationships are complicated
by the voluptuous presence of Dame Pliant (Karen
O'Leary), whose stupid wordlessness must be
rendered in the fine performance we are given.
And the two anabaptists (acted with brilliant
ferocity by Richard Carp and Stephen Volz) are
strenuously at odds with each other until the
magical change of a word from "coining" to
"casting" makes it possible for them to become
reconciled to their means and ends. It is hilarious to
watch these two believers discover at last a
rationalization which makes their deep involvement
with alchemy something other than trafficking with
the devil.
These and countless other congrueneces of
gesture and language illustrate that an excellent
presentation of Jonson's play — such as this one,
which has another week to run (student tickets cost
$1 ) — must take very seriously the textures
of his dramatic verse. Fortunately, this critical
point has been understood by the minor characters
as well as the major ones, so that one can
appreciate many subtleties in Kastril (Glenn
Holland), Surly (Andrew Mendelson), Lovewit
(Eric Booth Miller), and Dapper (Ronald Ross).
There are so many good things about this new
production of The Alchemist — including fine
technical effects in lighting and costume design —
that the reviewer must finally lament his lack of
space. If it is true that Philip Larson, the director, is
new at Stanford, there is all the more reason to
congratulate him for having chosen a great work,
admirably suited to our own neo-jacobean age, and
for having done it so well.
