# Traffic Signals Suggested For College Terrace
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Construction of more traffic lights
in College Terrace might provide a
workable solution to the problem of
excessive traffic in the area, according
to Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance.
Augsburger praised a plan proposed
by Palo Alto City Councilman Alan
Henderson calling for more traffic
lights, in order to reduce College
Terrace traffic.
"Residents of College Terrace are
entitled to protect themselves from
traffic in their area," Augsburger said.
But it is important to maintain easy
access in and out of the region, he
emphasized. Addition of traffic lights
to the region would discourage people
from entering the Terrace, but would
keep the area open, Augsburger added.
Augsburger said he is surprised that
so many Terrace residents object to
the barriers set up by Palo Alto. The
barriers were erected last September to
reduce the volume of traffic in the
area.
Unnatural Flow
"The barriers seem merely to divert
traffic from one street to another,"
Augsburger stated. "They create an
unnatural flow of traffic."
The Henderson plan would keep
the access to Stanford open for people
who want to drive onto the campus,
he said.
Augsburger disagreed with Vice
Mayor Enid Pearson's contention that
Stanford should allow the city to
annex one third of an acre of Stanford
land. The annexation would enable
Palo Alto to build a road from
Amherst Street west across Stanford
Avenue to Bowdoin Street.
Pearson claims that the annexation
of the land and subsequent
construction of the road would be the
best solution to the problem of traffic
on the Terrace.
Annexation Issues
If Stanford continues to refuse to
annex the land, Pearson said she will
attempt to persuade the city council
to refuse to annex the Frenchman's
Terrace area.
In 1972, Stanford requested that
Palo Alto annex Frenchman's Terrace,
the proposed site of a housing
complex for needy Palo Alto residents.
The University claimcd that it would
be better for the city to provide
municipal services to the project.
"T believe that is inappropriate for
anyone to hold up the development of
a socially desirable project,"
Augsburger declared, referring to
Pearson's strategy. "The issues of
College Terrace and Frenchman's
Terrace are unrelated."
Amateurs' Idea
The University's Land and Building
Committee studied the possibility of
constructing the type of road
suggested by Pearson, Augsburger said.
The Committee rejected the idea.

"I haven't heard a single
professional planner advocate this
plan," Augsburger remarked. "If
engineers favored it, I would be willing
to consider it, but the plan is being
promoted strictly by amateurs."
Not only would Pearson's proposal
fail to reduce traffic in the area, it
would reduce the size of Stanford's
green belts, Augsburger added.
"The University has gone to great
expense to create those green belts,"
he stated. "If we allowed them to be
sliced, what would the next
encroachment be?"
Public Discussion
The problem of College Terrace will
be discussed at a public meeting of the
Stanford-Palo Alto Liason Committee
at Lucille Nixon School next
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
Augsburger, a member of the
Liason Committee, explained that the
group usually meets in private. But
after considerable deliberation, the
committee decided to hold its meeting
next week in public because College
Terrace traffic is an issue of great
public concern.
The Liason Committee will
probably recommend to the Palo Alto
City Council that one particular plan
be adopted, Augsburger stated. But
because College Terrace is located in
Palo Alto, the council must make the
final decision regarding a solution for
the traffic dilemma.
