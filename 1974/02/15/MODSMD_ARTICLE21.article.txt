With a few notable exceptions,
animated films have been virtually
neglected by filmmakers of the
last two decades. Yellow
Submarine and, more recently,
bYitz the (kit, have probably been
the most successful feature-length
films in an industry tradition
dominated by Walt Disney and a
host of lesser cartoonists.
By combining the techniques
of animation with a futuristic
setting, New Worlds Pictures of
Prague has created Fantastic
Planet — a film considered
innovative enough by critics to
emerge as the winner of the
Cannes Film Festival for 1973.
In one interpretation, Fantastic
Planet is a chronicle of the age-old
struggle of a suppressed people to
attain equality through
revolution. On another level, the
film is an animated illustration of
the psychological processes
involved in racism and prejudice.
Through the use of bizarre
imagery that distorts the size,

shape, color and function of both
animate and inanimate objects,
Fantastic Planet is able to utilize a
de-familiari/.ation of perspective
reminiscent of Gulliver's lYauels
and Alice in Wonderland to
achieve its thematic ends.
As the film opens, a woman
clutching a child is seen running
through a forest of brambles.
When she emerges to climb a hill
just outside the forest, a huge blue
hand descends and, with one
finger, flicks her to the bottom.
As the climb and fall are repeated,
one is remined of the myth of
Sisyphus in all its irrevocable
futility.
The oppressors, called Drogs,
are enormous blue beings about
100 times the size of those
oppressed, the Ohms. The
contrasting sizes of the two
groups emphasize the master-slave
relationship, a theme comically
echoed later in the film when one
Drog suggests that a captured
Ohm infant be named Fido or
Rover.
In following the life of the
captured Ohm from infancy to
adulthood, Fantastic Planet
presents the complex world of
primitive brutality, scientific and
educational sophistication, pagan
ritual, mysticism, and cliche

politics that the Drogs have
created. The Drogs are followed in
a variety of activities from
political speech-making to
meditation that present a complex
composite of their society.
By extensive use of violent
colors (such as reds and oranges)
and cold tones (blues and greens)
the Drogs are alternately
portrayed as a brutal and a
peace-loving people. Early in the
film, for example, one of the Drog
children tortures an Ohm child by
physically and mentally abusing
it. The statement "This is fun"
appears twice in the scene,
signalling that the cruelty isn't
taken seriously by the child
because its object is an Ohm.
The scene is reminiscent of
human behavior as it portrays the
actions of a social group toward
an outsider. At times recognizably
human and often coldly realistic,
the Drogs can be said to
symbolize our own absurd
intolerance and hatred of
individuality and deviation from
the societal norm.
Supported by an eerie musical
score, and framed by a
background of shapes either
implicitly or explicitly obscene,
the film is a pessimistic
commentary on the human

condition. Like the blue hand in
the opening scene, several images
throughout Fantastic Planet serve
as metaphors for the absurdity
and futility of existence.
Perhaps the most notable of
these is a ridiculous purple animal
caged for no apparent reason. The
animal has many long black
feelers that extend beyond the
cage. At the end of each feeler is a
cluster of smaller feelers that
resemble a hand.
As a small fly-like creature
drifts by his cage, the animal
begins to laugh. The fly lands in
one of the clusters, is trapped by
the feelers in much the same way
as it might be caught by a venus
fly-trap, and is shaken by the
feeler and hurled to the ground —
all amid the animal's hideous
laughter. The camera recedes,
exposing the base of the cage and
the bodies of identical creatures
hurled to the same fate.
If the creators of Fantastic
Planet intended the film to end on
an affirmative note, they grossly
underestimated the film's
metaphoric power as a symbol of
our own tenuous existence.
Currently playing at the Fine Arts
Theater in Palo Alto, Fantastic
Planet is worth viewing for the
disturbing self-image it presents.
