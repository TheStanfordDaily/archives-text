# England's Uriah Heep Comes On Strong At Winterlar
## 
### STEWART DICKLER 
Remember that "mean fawning
fellow" who wormed his way into
your heart as the "'umblest person
going*?" That's right — Uriah
Heep, Charles Dickens' slimy little
schemer in David Copperfield.
If you were at Winterland last
Sunday night you'd know that
Uriah Heep isn't mean and
fawning anymore. In fact, they
aren't very 'umble anymore
either. The twentieth century
Uriah Heep is one English rock
group that comes on strong.
Rivaling Grand Funk or a

Boeing 747 for loudness, Uriah
Heep is a shocking band. Not only
is their music loud, but it just
happens to be good. To know
that, ail you have to do is listen to
their album Demons ana Wizards.
Uriah opened their first San
Francisco engagement with a song
from Demons, "Easy Livin'."
Heep is another rock antics
group similar in style to Deep
Purple. The five-man group
consists of lead singer David
Byron, keyboard and song writer
Ken Henseley, guitarist Mick Box,
drummer Lee Kerslake, and

bassist Gary Thain.
The focus of the group is David
Byron, who's able to scream out
like a screech owl on "Sweet
Lorraine," the second rocker that
Heep played, or who shows his
vocal prowess on beautiful
numbers like the next song "July
Tears." Byron is the man who
relates with the audience, whether
it's taking a hit off joints from the
audience or guzzling the jug of red
wine handed up from the
screaming fans. He's the one down
on the ground stroking his mike
stand as Ken Henseley beats his
organ.
Seated at the organ, facing
across the stage towards the left
wings, Henseley almost becomes
the Phantom of the Opera as he
plays his grand organ solo
"Gypsy." "Sweet Freedom" was
then followed by their other hit
"Look at Yourself," in which Lee
Kerslake performs an entertaining
drum solo. He's a real body
drummer, giving his all as he walks
along the tops of his drums while
playing this impressive set.
The band's encore, after several
minutes of the Heep chant by the
audience, was marked by an
explosion and confetti. They
proceeded to play a rock and roll
medley of '50s hits. "Roll Over

Beethoven," "Blue Suede Shoes,"
"At the Hop," and "Whole Lotta
Shakin' Goin' On" were marked
by flashing explosions, strobe
lights, and clouds of smoke a la
Deep Purple.
Along with Uriah Heep on
their ten city tour is Manfred
Mann and the Earth band. Yes,
that's right, the "Mighty Quinn"
himself. Mann has changed quite a
bit from the days of the "Mighty
Quinn" and "Doowah Ditty" in
the 19605. His latest albums, Get
Your Rocks Off and Solar Wind,
are much more in line with the
style of Pink Floyd, termed
"spacy" by Mann.
"Father of Day, Father of
Night," the new hit from the
Solar Wind album, started off
Mann's first set, much to the
pleasure of the fans. Like "Mighty
Quinn," it is a Dylan song that
Mann is making famous.
"Quilo the Dog" and other
songs from the latest album
simply set the stage, though, for
"Mighty Quinn." Almost the
entire audience sang along as
Mann and the band produced a
modern, spaced-out version,
complimented by the audio antics
of Mann on the mini-moog
synthesizer.

HEEP HEAP—Uriah Heep, perhaps comparable in sound to Grand Funk Railroad or a Boeing 747, kept
Winterland fans rocking last Sunday. Group members are Mick Box, Lee Kerslake, Gary Thain, Ken
Hensley, and David Byron. Touring with Heep is Manfred Mann, last heard from when "Mighty Quinn"
hit American AM stations.
