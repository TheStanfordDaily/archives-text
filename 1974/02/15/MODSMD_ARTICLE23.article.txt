# Mangione Quartet Play Smooth Jazz
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
Monterey has one. Berkeley has one. Concord has one. Palo Alto is
not about to be outdone.
Gunn High School initiated an ambitious and commendable
undertaking when they hosted the Palo Alto Jazz Festival last week at
Spangcnberg Auditorium, featuring Woody Shaw last Thursday night
and Chuck Mangione Friday.
Mangione, who plays flugelhorn and electric piano, appeared with
Gerry Niewood on alto flute, soprano and tenor saxes; Al Johnson on
bass; and Joe Labarbera on drums. A successful artist, Mangione
gained recognition with his recordings with the Rochester
Philharmonic Orchestra while serving as Musical Director of the
Eastman School of Music.
Onstage, in orange overalls and a hat reminiscent of Leon Russell,
Mangione's mellow manner and sophisticated music appealed
immediately to the audience.
The quartet opened with "Legend of the One-Eyed Sailor," written
by Mangione which spotlighted a smooth-toned soprano sax solo by
Niewood.
Mangione's compositions are melodic and satisfying. He has played
with such musicians as Dizzy Gillespie, Maynard Ferguson, and Chick
Corea. Mangione possesses a pure tone and a direct, simple style on
flugelhorn; his piano work is also economical.
During "Firewatchers" Mangione executed machine-gun runs with
his lightning-fast fingers and Niewood pleased the crowd with an
awesome tenor solo. "Please Treat Her Well" featured a restful alto
flute solo by Niewood with Mangione's limpid electric piano
accompaniment.
The quartet's music is rock rhythms enhanced with simple
melodies and jazz solos, a combination that breeds familiarity with a
variety of tastes. The younger members of the audience were
particularly impressed with the phenomenal musicianship of the four.
A rousing bass solo by Johnson and the sheer musical excellence
evoked a standing ovation after the first set.
During the second half, the group sensitively performed "Legacy,"
exhibiting a beautiful, clear-toned soprano sax solo, and Mangione's
vibratoless flugelhorn penetrated the hall during "Hill Where the Lord
Hides." Another standing ovation and shouts for more brought the
Chuck Mangione Quartet back for an encore, performing the popular
"Land of Make Believe."
Compliments are due to Gunn High School for a good idea and a
fine presentation.
