# Stanford Women Host Invitational Swim Meet
## 
### 
Hoping to meet qualifying standards for the Women's Nationals
next month, the top women swimmers on the West Coast will
compete in the Stanford Invitational meet today and tomorrow at the
new de Guerre Pools.
Defending NCAA champion Arizona, which coasted to the national
title by a huge margin last year, heads an impressive field in the team
competition. Other entrants include Stanford, San Jose State,
Sacramento State, Arizona State, UC-Davis and possibly Hayward
State. Stanford coach Betsy Weeks

predicts an Arizona victory, and
figures her Stanford team should
place second. The Cards, who
culminated an undefeated regular
season with a victory in the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC)
championships in December, may
be challenged by NCIAC runnerup
UC-Davis for the second spot.
Five Stanford women, Vickie
Hayes, Jackie Brink, Mei Ong,
Kathy Hoinz and Sue Trupin, have
already met qualifying times for
the nationals. Nan Lenschel, who
is only a tenth of a second away
from the qualifying standard in
the 50-yard freestyle, is one of
several Stanford swimmers hoping
to qualify this weekend.
Weeks feels confident that
Stanford will improve on last
year's 40th place finish in the
nationals (out of 80 teams),
especially if Cardinal swimmers
are successful this weekend. The
national meet will be held at Penn
State.
Hayes, who participated in the
World Championships in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia last summer, will be
Stanford's main attraction. Hayes
set NCIAC records in the 50- and
100-meter breastroke events last
December and was a member of
Stanford's record-breaking 400
medley relay team.
Preliminaries begin at 10:30
a.m. today and tomorrow with
finals scheduled for 3 p.m. on
both days. Admission is free.
