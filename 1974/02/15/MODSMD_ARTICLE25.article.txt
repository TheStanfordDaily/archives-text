# Card Women Lose To Davis
## 
### 
Stanford's women's basketball
team opened up a 15-point lead
midway in the second quarter, but
a persistent UC-Davis team closed
the gap and eventually recorded a
42-37 victory last night at the
Women's Gym.
Stanford, now 1-2 on the
season, lost control of the game
when Davis switched from g
person-to-person to a zone press
defense. The defense forced
numerous Cardinal miscues.
Stanford stayed close until the
final minutes, when Davis scored a
flurry of baskets, stealing the ball
twice on inbounds plays.
Stanford center Paula Johnson
led all scoring with 10 points,
while freshmen Nancy Erickson
and Kathy Levinson added nine
each. Lynn Spencer paced the
Davis attack with nine points.
In a junior varsity preliminary
game, Stanford edged Davis 2S-26
behind Barb Tyler's eight points
and 12 steals. Jeanne Laberge
contributed six points.
Both games were dominated by
the referees, as the clock was
stopped continually for foul shots
and jump balls. A crowd of about
100 witnessed the contests.
Stanford's next game is against
Cal State-Hayward Thursday at 6
p.m. at the Women's Gym.
