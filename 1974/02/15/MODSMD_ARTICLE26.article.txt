# Rule Change Won't Halt Dynasty
## Tennis Season Opens 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Just when Stanford thought it had found the
key to winning the national championship in
tennis, the NCAA rulemakers changed the game on
them.
Seriously, the new rule, which says that the first
person to win four points wins each game, is
designed to speed up play by eliminating endless
deuces and ads — and not designed to break up any
budding Cardinal dynasty.
But the new ruling should make quite a
difference this year in college tennis — beginning
today when the Cardinals open their varsity season
against Cal State-Bakersfield at 2:30 p.m. on the
Varsity Courts.
Just because today is the start of the varsity
season, don't expect to see Sandy Mayer out there.
Coach Dick Gould won't use Mayer until April. In
fact, today's lineup will look more like the JV team
which beat Canada 7-2 Wednesday (with an
improved Craig Johnson at first singles) than the
varsity lineup Gould will use in this season's big
matches and tournaments.
It's too early to say exactly what the lineup will
be, as 10 players are vying for six singles spots. But
the series of rungs that make up the "ladder" in
Gould's office tell an interesting story.
Can't Say Enough
At the top of the ladder is Mayer. Not too much
has to be said about the defending NCAA
champion, top amateur player in the U.S.,
Wimbledon semifinalist, etc., etc. But it might be
noted that the senior star has "played every guy on
the team," according to Gould, trying to improve
their games.
The second spot belongs to Pat DuPre, a
sophomore. DuPre finished last season 18-2,
playing fourth singles, and has polished his game
since then. While DuPre's serve still isn't the
strongest part of his game, it's improved quite a bit
since the beginning of last year, Gould asserts.
DuPre's improvement has moved junior Jim
Delaney down a spot, at least temporarily. Delaney,
an All-American, last year proved his talent by
defeating UCLA's Jeff Austin and reaching the
quarterfinals of the NCAA singles tournament
before losing to USC's Raul Ramirez.
Sophomore John Whitlinger is much improved
from last year, "playing with more confidence,"
according to Gould. It's likely that he will join
NCAA veterans Mayer, Delaney and DuPre at this

year's national championship in Los Angeles.

While the NCAA tourney calls for only four
singles players, most of the year's other events,
including the Pac-8 meet, which Stanford lost last
year, have six singles slots.
It's sort of surprising to see Mark Mitchell's
name at fifth singles. But Mitchell, a sophomore
who last year played only sparingly, has improved
his game tremendously, winning several key
intr&squad matches despite a bad leg.
One of those matches was against junior Chico
Hagey (now listed sixth) Wednesday. Hagey, out
with a broken ankle last year, is hitting well but
had his problems against Mitchell in a friendly
though not brilliant match. As a freshman, Hagey
was an All-American, and could easily get back up
there again.
Junior Chip Fisher didn't begin last season in the
top six, but came on strong and played quite well
in the fifth slot later in the season. He'll try for a
repeat performance this season.
Younger Mayer
Another player with a chance to break into the
lineup is freshman Gene Mayer, Mayer, a year
younger than the normal freshman, is best known
for a superb forehead. Gould would just as soon
have everyone forget that he's the younger brother
of Sandy, as the comparisons put pressure on the
younger Mayer.
Another fresnman, Nick Saviano, holds the
ninth spot. Saviano, a top junior player, has had
trouble with consistency. Wednesday, Saviano beat
senior Paul Sidone in a no-love-lost match, and so
Sidone, who's been playing fairly well, ranks 10th.
The doubles lineups are not yet set, but it's
likely that last year's NCAA doubles champions
Mayer-Delaney will have the first position, with
DuPre-Whitlinger in the second spot. The
graduation of Rick Fisher and Gary Groslimond,
Stanford's ace lefthanded doubles team for four
years, has left a hole for the other spot.
The first goal this year, as every year, is to win
the NCAA championship. Winning the Pac-B's and
the head-to-head dual matches against USC, UCLA
and SMU, the nation's other tennis powers, will
also serve as adequate incentive for the team, now
in its second year of being the favorite for every
match.

tennis, the NCAA rulemakers changed the game on
them.
Seriously, the new rule, which says that the first
person to win four points wins each game, is
designed to speed up play by eliminating endless
deuces and ads — and not designed to break up any
budding Cardinal dynasty.
But the new ruling should make quite a
difference this year in college tennis — beginning
today when the Cardinals open their varsity season
against Cal State-Bakersfield at 2:30 p.m. on the
Varsity Courts.
Just because today is the start of the varsity
season, don't expect to see Sandy Mayer out there.
Coach Dick Gould won't use Mayer until April. In
fact, today's lineup will look more like the JV team
which beat Canada 7-2 Wednesday (with an
improved Craig Johnson at first singles) than the
varsity lineup Gould will use in this season's big
matches and tournaments.
It's too early to say exactly what the lineup will
be, as 10 players are vying for six singles spots. But
the series of rungs that make up the "ladder" in
Gould's office tell an interesting story.
Can't Say Enough
At the top of the ladder is Mayer. Not too much
has to be said about the defending NCAA
champion, top amateur player in the U.S.,
Wimbledon semifinalist, etc., etc. But it might be
noted that the senior star has "played every guy on
the team," according to Gould, trying to improve
their games.
The second spot belongs to Pat DuPre, a
sophomore. DuPre finished last season 18-2,
playing fourth singles, and has polished his game
since then. While DuPre's serve still isn't the
strongest part of his game, it's improved quite a bit
since the beginning of last year, Gould asserts.
DuPre's improvement has moved junior Jim
Delaney down a spot, at least temporarily. Delaney,
an All-American, last year proved his talent by
defeating UCLA's Jeff Austin and reaching the
quarterfinals of the NCAA singles tournament
before losing to USC's Raul Ramirez.
Sophomore John Whitlinger is much improved
from last year, "playing with more confidence,"
according to Gould. It's likely that he will join
NCAA veterans Mayer, Delaney and DuPre at this

year's national championship in Los Angeles.

While the NCAA tourney calls for only four
singles players, most of the year's other events,
including the Pac-8 meet, which Stanford lost last
year, have six singles slots.
It's sort of surprising to see Mark Mitchell's
name at fifth singles. But Mitchell, a sophomore
who last year played only sparingly, has improved
his game tremendously, winning several key
intr&squad matches despite a bad leg.
One of those matches was against junior Chico
Hagey (now listed sixth) Wednesday. Hagey, out
with a broken ankle last year, is hitting well but
had his problems against Mitchell in a friendly
though not brilliant match. As a freshman, Hagey
was an All-American, and could easily get back up
there again.
Junior Chip Fisher didn't begin last season in the
top six, but came on strong and played quite well
in the fifth slot later in the season. He'll try for a
repeat performance this season.
Younger Mayer
Another player with a chance to break into the
lineup is freshman Gene Mayer, Mayer, a year
younger than the normal freshman, is best known
for a superb forehead. Gould would just as soon
have everyone forget that he's the younger brother
of Sandy, as the comparisons put pressure on the
younger Mayer.
Another fresnman, Nick Saviano, holds the
ninth spot. Saviano, a top junior player, has had
trouble with consistency. Wednesday, Saviano beat
senior Paul Sidone in a no-love-lost match, and so
Sidone, who's been playing fairly well, ranks 10th.
The doubles lineups are not yet set, but it's
likely that last year's NCAA doubles champions
Mayer-Delaney will have the first position, with
DuPre-Whitlinger in the second spot. The
graduation of Rick Fisher and Gary Groslimond,
Stanford's ace lefthanded doubles team for four
years, has left a hole for the other spot.
The first goal this year, as every year, is to win
the NCAA championship. Winning the Pac-B's and
the head-to-head dual matches against USC, UCLA
and SMU, the nation's other tennis powers, will
also serve as adequate incentive for the team, now
in its second year of being the favorite for every
match.

person to win four points wins each game, is
designed to speed up play by eliminating endless
deuces and ads — and not designed to break up any
budding Cardinal dynasty.
But the new ruling should make quite a
difference this year in college tennis — beginning
today when the Cardinals open their varsity season
against Cal State-Bakersfield at 2:30 p.m. on the
Varsity Courts.
Just because today is the start of the varsity
season, don't expect to see Sandy Mayer out there.
Coach Dick Gould won't use Mayer until April. In
fact, today's lineup will look more like the JV team
which beat Canada 7-2 Wednesday (with an
improved Craig Johnson at first singles) than the
varsity lineup Gould will use in this season's big
matches and tournaments.
It's too early to say exactly what the lineup will
be, as 10 players are vying for six singles spots. But
the series of rungs that make up the "ladder" in
Gould's office tell an interesting story.
Can't Say Enough
At the top of the ladder is Mayer. Not too much
has to be said about the defending NCAA
champion, top amateur player in the U.S.,
Wimbledon semifinalist, etc., etc. But it might be
noted that the senior star has "played every guy on
the team," according to Gould, trying to improve
their games.
The second spot belongs to Pat DuPre, a
sophomore. DuPre finished last season 18-2,
playing fourth singles, and has polished his game
since then. While DuPre's serve still isn't the
strongest part of his game, it's improved quite a bit
since the beginning of last year, Gould asserts.
DuPre's improvement has moved junior Jim
Delaney down a spot, at least temporarily. Delaney,
an All-American, last year proved his talent by
defeating UCLA's Jeff Austin and reaching the
quarterfinals of the NCAA singles tournament
before losing to USC's Raul Ramirez.
Sophomore John Whitlinger is much improved
from last year, "playing with more confidence,"
according to Gould. It's likely that he will join
NCAA veterans Mayer, Delaney and DuPre at this

year's national championship in Los Angeles.
Sue Singles Slots
While the NCAA tourney calls for only four
singles players, most of the year's other events,
including the Pac-8 meet, which Stanford lost last
year, have six singles slots.
It's sort of surprising to see Mark Mitchell's
name at fifth singles. But Mitchell, a sophomore
who last year played only sparingly, has improved
his game tremendously, winning several key
intr&squad matches despite a bad leg.
One of those matches was against junior Chico
Hagey (now listed sixth) Wednesday. Hagey, out
with a broken ankle last year, is hitting well but
had his problems against Mitchell in a friendly
though not brilliant match. As a freshman, Hagey
was an All-American, and could easily get back up
there again.
Junior Chip Fisher didn't begin last season in the
top six, but came on strong and played quite well
in the fifth slot later in the season. He'll try for a
repeat performance this season.
Younger Mayer
Another player with a chance to break into the
lineup is freshman Gene Mayer, Mayer, a year
younger than the normal freshman, is best known
for a superb forehead. Gould would just as soon
have everyone forget that he's the younger brother
of Sandy, as the comparisons put pressure on the
younger Mayer.
Another fresnman, Nick Saviano, holds the
ninth spot. Saviano, a top junior player, has had
trouble with consistency. Wednesday, Saviano beat
senior Paul Sidone in a no-love-lost match, and so
Sidone, who's been playing fairly well, ranks 10th.
The doubles lineups are not yet set, but it's
likely that last year's NCAA doubles champions
Mayer-Delaney will have the first position, with
DuPre-Whitlinger in the second spot. The
graduation of Rick Fisher and Gary Groslimond,
Stanford's ace lefthanded doubles team for four
years, has left a hole for the other spot.
The first goal this year, as every year, is to win
the NCAA championship. Winning the Pac-B's and
the head-to-head dual matches against USC, UCLA
and SMU, the nation's other tennis powers, will
also serve as adequate incentive for the team, now
in its second year of being the favorite for every
match.
