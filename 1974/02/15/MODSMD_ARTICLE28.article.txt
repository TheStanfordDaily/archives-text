# Cards Eye Wrestling Record
## 
### STEVE SOULE 
Hoping to set a school record
for most dual match wins in one
season (eight), Stanford's
wrestling team journeys south for
three matches this weekend.
Tonight the Cards take on
UC-Santa Barbara at 6 p.m. before
traveling to Bakersfield tomorrow
for a double dual against Cal
State-Bakersfield and Cal
Poly-Pomona. Stanford's record
currently stands at 6-9-1.
Coach Joe De Meo is optimistic
about his team's chances to win
two out of three, but is hesitant
to predict a Card victory over
Bakersfield. "Bakersfield has the
third or fourth best team in the
state," De Meo said, "so it's gonna
be tough. But our guys are
tremendous wrestlers when
they're on. You can never tell
what's gonna happen."
One bright spot for the
Cardinals is that they should be in
better physical shape than the
past few weeks. De Meo
comments: "We definitely should
be healthier. Emmett Stanton
should be 100 percent after sitting
out five weeks with a string of
injuries, and Jim Rappaport could
be back too."
Stanton will be tested
immediately, as Bakersfield's
Doug Porter is ranked second in
the state. That match, along with
Marc Frelier's (177), should be
the toughest individual matchups
for the Cards.
The wrestlers obviously hope
to tie the school record, but their
primary goal is preparing for the
Pac-8 championships on March
1-2 at Berkeley. This weekend's
matches and two more next week
against California and Fresno
State are the final tuneups for the
Pac-8 event.
