# Cal, Washington Test Cardinal Gymnasts
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Bay Area gymnastics fans will
be treated to a double dose this
weekend as Stanford clashes with
California and Washington. The
compulsories are scheduled for
Berkeley tonight at 7:30 p.m.,
with the optionals tomorrow at 8
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Undefeated Cal was the Pac-8
champion last season and has to
be considered the favorite again
this year. The Huskies and the
Cards, second and third
respectively in the conference in
1973, will be out to show their
strength to the Bears in this, the
final meet before the Pac-8
championships.
Stanford has been having its
problems this season, problems
that stem from lack of depth
rather than the injuries that
weakened the Cards last year. Cut
down to three all-around

performers from the five they had
last season, the Cards have been
especially weak in the parallel bars
and high bar. In both the
compulsories and the optionals
against Cal and Oregon three
weeks ago, Stanford was leading
until those final two events.
The Cards, however, are not
the only team with problems. Cal
has been plagued by injuries, moct
notably to Steve Posner, who is
probably the Bears' best
all-around man. Veterans Tom
Weeden and Clark Johnson, along
with freshmen Dave Eby and Mike
Dubos have nevertheless managed
to keep Cal's winning streak alive.
Washington, according to
Coach Hamada, was a little
weaker than last year," but the
Huskies are still a power to be
reckoned with.
Stanford will be going with its
regular lineup, with the possible
exception of Bob Anderson in the
all-around. Anderson has missed
practice this week with a pulled
back muscle.
