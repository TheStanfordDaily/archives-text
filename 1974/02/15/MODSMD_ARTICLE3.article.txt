# French Program Moves To Paris
## 
### DON COX 
The department of French and
Italian and the Overseas Studies Office
yesterday announced the move of the
special Stanford French program,
formerly associated with the
University of Tours, to Paris,
beginning next fall.
The move will not affect the
Stanford-in-France overseas program
which has been in Tours since 1960.
The 10 to 15 students in the new
Paris program will be enrolled at one
of the branches of the University of
Paris, depending on each student's
academic speciality, for fall and winter
quarters with the possibility of
extending studies through the spring
quarter.
Prof. Leo Weinstein, chairman of
the subcommittee in charge of the
French program, said students "will be
as fully involved in French life as
possible, living like French students
and taking courses with them."
Weinstein said the program would
be for students with a proficiency in
the language who "really want to be

involved in French life and not be
spoon-fed. Students are going to have
to contribute a large share of their
own initiative. They are not going to
find Stanford in Paris, but Paris in
Paris."
Initial Year
Pauline Newman-Gordon, professor
of French and Italian, will direct the
program during its first year. She will
be in charge of an introductory course
designed to acquaint students with
French higher education.
Students will be offered the choice
of living in residence halls, in private
rooms, or with families.
Prof. Alphonse Juilland, chairman
of the French and Italian department
and credited by Weinstein for making
the necessary negotiations and
arrangements in Paris, said that
students were free to seek housing on
their own and that "the program is
prepared to refund the student if he
thinks he can do better on his own,"
Mark Mancall, director of Overseas
Studies, said that the University "has
employed a representative who is

prepared to help students find
alternate housing."
Weinstein recognized that students
might encounter some difficulties in
the Paris program. "The University of
Paris is not like an American
university. Courses are announced late,
often just prior to the term, and
professors will not go out of their way
to help a student. The university as a
whole is not as well organized," he
said.
No Requirements
Although proficiency in French is
recommended, "there are no formal
requirements," said Juilland. "But if
we decide a student's background is
not good enough, we won't advise him
to go."
"This is not a program exclusively
for French majors," said Weinstein.
"Any Stanford student that has
proficiency in French is more than
welcome."
Then' will be a Stanford "professor
in residence" and an administrative
aide in Paris to handle academic and
administrative problems encountered

by the students.
A general meeting will be held in
Tresidder 271 on Feb. 21 at 4:15 p.m.
for students interested in obtaining
further information about the
program. Information is also available
at the Overseas Studies Office in Old
Union.

alternate housing."
Weinstein recognized that students
might encounter some difficulties in
the Paris program. "The University of
Paris is not like an American
university. Courses are announced late,
often just prior to the term, and
professors will not go out of their way
to help a student. The university as a
whole is not as well organized," he
said.
No Requirements
Although proficiency in French is
recommended, "there are no formal
requirements," said Juilland. "But if
we decide a student's background is
not good enough, we won't advise him
to go."
"This is not a program exclusively
for French majors," said Weinstein.
"Any Stanford student that has
proficiency in French is more than
welcome."
Then' will be a Stanford "professor
in residence" and an administrative
aide in Paris to handle academic and
administrative problems encountered

by the students.
A general meeting will be held in
Tresidder 271 on Feb. 21 at 4:15 p.m.
for students interested in obtaining
further information about the
program. Information is also available
at the Overseas Studies Office in Old

PARIS PROGRAM PROGNOSIS — A change in the special Stanford French
program will enable students to attend various branches of the University of
Paris, beginning next fall. French and Italian Department chairman Alphonse
J u ill and (seated), Overseas Studies director Mark Mancall,and others announced
the program's move from Tours to Paris at a press conference yesterday.
The department of French and
Italian and the Overseas Studies Office
yesterday announced the move of the
special Stanford French program,
formerly associated with the
University of Tours, to Paris,
beginning next fall.
The move will not affect the
Stanford-in-France overseas program
which has been in Tours since 1960.
The 10 to 15 students in the new
Paris program will be enrolled at one
of the branches of the University of
Paris, depending on each student's
academic speciality, for fall and winter
quarters with the possibility of
extending studies through the spring
quarter.
Prof. Leo Weinstein, chairman of
the subcommittee in charge of the
French program, said students "will be
as fully involved in French life as
possible, living like French students
and taking courses with them."
Weinstein said the program would
be for students with a proficiency in
the language who "really want to be

involved in French life and not be
spoon-fed. Students are going to have
to contribute a large share of their
own initiative. They are not going to
find Stanford in Paris, but Paris in
Paris."
Initial Year
Pauline Newman-Gordon, professor
of French and Italian, will direct the
program during its first year. She will
be in charge of an introductory course
designed to acquaint students with
French higher education.
Students will be offered the choice
of living in residence halls, in private
rooms, or with families.
Prof. Alphonse Juilland, chairman
of the French and Italian department
and credited by Weinstein for making
the necessary negotiations and
arrangements in Paris, said that
students were free to seek housing on
their own and that "the program is
prepared to refund the student if he
thinks he can do better on his own,"
Mark Mancall, director of Overseas
Studies, said that the University "has
employed a representative who is

prepared to help students find
alternate housing."
Weinstein recognized that students
might encounter some difficulties in
the Paris program. "The University of
Paris is not like an American
university. Courses are announced late,
often just prior to the term, and
