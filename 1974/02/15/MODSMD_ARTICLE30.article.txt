# Shuffling The Cards
## DH Experiment 
### Dave Robinson 
A loyal fan of the national pastime strolled into Sunken Diamond
last Saturday afternoon to bask in the sunshine and watch Stanford's
opening doubleheader.
He winced slightly when he saw the Cardinals were using aluminum
bats. He groaned when he heard that Stanford would wear red jerseys
during the second game. But when the public address announcer
bellowed, "Batting ninth for Stanford, designated hitter Kevin
Sullivan," the fan erupted into an angry tirade.
"Jesus Christ," he screamed, "This game gets less recognizable
every year."
The designated hitter, a controversial rule adopted by the
American League last summer, has invaded the campuses in time for
the 1974 college season. No longer will pitchers break the monotony
of long afternoons with surprising singles and embarrassing strikeouts.
No longer will the fan identify with the inept hurler flailing futilely at
a curving baseball. Red jerseys notwithstanding, the game has lost
much of its color.
"I'll probably never bat again in my whole career," Card pitcher A 1
Arthur moaned in the bullpen during Wednesday's game against Santa
Clara. "From an aesthetic viewpoint, I think the DH takes a lot of
quality out of the game."
Little Chinkers
The designated hitter isn't all Arthur is mad about. "Ask me about
aluminum bats," he prodded. "I hate 'em. The batters get little
chinkers off the handle that should be broken bats."
Dean Stotz was less worried about losing his opportunities to hit,
but more concerned with the prospect of trying to retire nine solid
opposing hitters. "1 like to get my cuts," he admitted, "but the big
thing is that the DH rule takes away an easy out."
And Arthur added that "there's no such thing as the bottom of the
lineup anymore."
Some of the pitchers, however, saw the brighter points of the new
rule. "I've just decided I'm not going to pick up a bat all year," said
Dave Frost. The DH "doesn't bother me a bit. It helps you go — you
don't have to run the bases and you won't get pulled for a
pinch-hitter."
Obviously, there are valid arguments on both sides. Official scorer
.John Wright says the DH "lets one more person play, which makes it a
more interesting game for me. The rule takes something away | the
opportunity for pitchers to hit], but I think it adds more."
Assistant coach Mark Marquess says the rule allows pitchers to
"spend more time on things they're supposed to do well, like pickoff
moves. And instead of worrying about batting and running the bases,
the pitcher and the pitching coach can discuss the game in the
dugout."
Playing Time
One oft-neglected viewpoint was voiced by bullpen catcher Jon
Crosby, who normally would enter the game only as a pinch-hitter.
'The DH cuts into playing time for guys like me," Crosby said.
"There just aren't as many pinch-hitters used."
The designated hitter would seem to reduce the prevalence of
strategic ploys like sacrifice bunts and squeeze plays, besides
eliminating the chance for pitchers to hit. And after aluminum bats
and red jerseys, who knows, designated bunters and runners may
come next, developments that might create the need for designated
fans.
Still, Marquess feels it's a good rule. "Some people might complain
that a good-hitting pitcher can't hit, but that's not a problem because
he can hit — you don't have to use a DH."
At St. Louis University, baseball coach Tom Dix plans to achieve
the seemingly contradictory goals of using a DH and keeping his ace
hurler happy. Steve Walsh will pitch in the regular rotation, and bat in
the DH spot when he's not on the mount.
Stanford's Max Goldstein might be considered for a similar
assignment, but the remainder of the pitching staff will sit helplessly
in the bullpen, dreaming of past glories.
"I've hit two college homers," Arthur said, his eyes focusing on a
Santa Clara batter digging in at the plate, "and I may never get the
chance again."
