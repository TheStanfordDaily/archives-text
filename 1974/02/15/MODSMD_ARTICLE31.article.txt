# Vengeful Bruin Swimmers Await Confident Cardinals
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
In last year's Stanford-UCLA
swim meet at the old Encina pool,
the score was tied going into the
last relay. After two legs of the
relay, the Bmins had built up a
slight lead over the Cardinals, but
Stanford's third swimmer, Martin
Pedley, gradually caught up. With
one final stretch to the wall he
touched out the Bruin's third
man. Then Dean Anderson
exploded off the blocks. Getting
an incredible start. Dean quickly
lengthened the lead and held on
to win the relay and the meet for
Stanford.
So great was Dean's start, the
UCLA coaches claimed he jumped
early. A parent of one of UCLA's
swimmers was so distraught as to
ask Dean to disqualify himself.
But the officials said Dean didn't
jump and, as is usually the case,
the officials' decision was final.
Now, after a long year of
waiting for coach Bob Horn and
his Bruins, Stanford and UCLA
face each other again, only this
time it's in Southern California.
This morning coach Jim
Gaughran and his swimmers will
board a plane for Los Angeles,

where tonight at 7:30 p.m. they
face the powerful USC Trojans.
The rematch against UCLA is set
for tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Not Worried
The Trojans will probably beat
the Cards tonight. Yet Gaughran
isn't too worried. He plans to
swim his charges in only one of
their best events.
Looking at the SC squad is like
looking at a list of All-Stars: John
Naber, 200 backstroke American
record holder; Steve Furniss, last
year's 200 and 400 individual
medley championn; Jack Tingley,
American record holder in the
1650; just to name a few. But
despite the astounding depth of
second-ranked SC, there should be
some magnificent races.
The 50 free will pit Joe
Bottom against Stanford's Dave
Fairbank. Bottom has recorded a
20.6, Fairbank a 20.7. In the 200
individual medley,.John Hencken
(1:55.1) will face Scott Brown
(1:54.77). Both the medley and
freestyle relays should be classic
struggles.
But the real grudge match will
be down the freeway on Saturday.
Of all the rivalries in Pac-8

athletics, the one between
Stanford and UCLA swimmers
rates among the greatest.
Every Event
Gaughran plans to "Swim
everybody in every event we can
put them in to score as many
points as possible." He'll have to.
UCLA is ranked third in the
nation.
As in the Washington meet
earlier this year, Stanford must
take the key events in order to
win. And just as against
Washington, the races where the
points could go either way are the
medley relay, the backstroke and
the distances.
In the first event of the day,
the 400 medley relay, Handy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Roux and Dean Anderson must
defeat a UCLA team that has
clocked 3:26.91 as compared to
Stanford's best of 3:27.3.
In the backstroke, Randy
Whitchurch will challenge Brian
McKinley. Whitchurch's best this
season is a 1:56.7, McKinley's a
1:56.61.
Distance Baffles
The distances find Cards Terry
Sutton and Steve Strong facing
Rex Favero. Currently, Sutton's
best 1000 time is ahead of
Favero's while the Bruin has the
edge in the 500.
UCLA will be strong in the
middle distance events and the
butterfly. Steve Genter, a '72
Olympian, will probably swim the
200 and the 500, although there is
some speculation that he might
swim the 100 to try to break up
Stanford's sprint domination.
The Cards are counting on the
sprinters and Hencken to provide
the strength of their attack. If all
goes well, Stanford could
conceivably sweep both the 50
and 100 and get firsts from
Hencken in the breast and
individual medley. Psychologically
speaking, Stanford's swimmers
couldn't be better prepared.
And of all the great battles
scheduled for this weekend,
probably the most interesting will
be the freestyle relay against
UCLA. Stanford's sprint relay
boasts a time of 3:05.8 to UCLA's
3:07.69. Will it go down to the
last relay like last year? As coach
Gaughran said. "We're hoping it
does."
