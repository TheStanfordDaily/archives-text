/As the Cardinals go, so goes
the Daily's fearless forecaster.
Three weeks ago, both Howie
Dallmar and the Daily
prognosticator were on the
verge of resignation — or
maybe even suicide. Stanford's
record was 5 9, and the Daily
sported a miserable 16-11
mark.
Since then, however, the
Cardinals have won four
straight and the fearless
forecaster has correctly
predicted 18 of his last 19
games, leaving their respective
records at 9-9 and 34-12.
This week, as usual, both
Stanford and the Daily will rise
or fall together, as the Daily
predicts a pair of victories for
the Cardinals in the Northwest.
Meanwhile, UCLA will win
twice, USC will defeat Oregon

but lose to Oregon State and
hapless California will lose a
pair.
After all those happenings
are duly recorded by the Pac-8
office, Stanford will be tied
with Oregon for third place in
the league, with USC only a
game ahead in second. In other
words, even though the March
2 game against UCLA at
Maples is sold out, you can still
see the season's most
important game - Stanford vs.
USC on March 1.
