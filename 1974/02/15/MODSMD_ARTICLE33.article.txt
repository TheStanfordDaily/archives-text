# Baseball Team Meets Arizona State
## Tough Test For Card Nine 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Stanford's young and
inexperienced baseball team faces
a challenge similar to taking a
final exam on the first day of
school when the Cardinals meet
Arizona State at 7:30 tonight in
Phoenix Municipal Stadium.
Stanford will play the Sun
Devils at 1 p.m. tomorrow
afternoon on the ASU campus
before going back to Phoenix for
a 7:30 night game to close out the
series.
Stanford dropped a 7-4
decision to Santa Clara
Wednesday afternoon at Sunken
Diamond in a game making up a
Tuesday afternoon rain out.
Arizona State, which won an 11-0
game with the ASU Alumni, is
opening the season against the

Cards.
"My feeling is that we're
putting the ball in play offensively
and our defense is good," said
Stanford coach Ray Young.
However the pitching aspect of
the Cardinal program is still
questionable.
Lost Lead
The Cards were leading Santa
Clara 4-3 going into the eighth
inning when the roof fell in on
Stanford ace Al Arthur. Two-run
homers by Phil Convertino and
Gene DeLyon sent the Cards to
defeat for the second time in
three games.
"It was a lack of concentration
and thinking at that point," said
Young about the two "gopher"
balls, both fast straight balls.
Catcher Dave Baker took
partial blame for the home runs,
saying that he called too many
fast balls. "The first time I
thought they would be bunting,"
said Baker. 'The next one was a
gamble that turned out to be a
bad call."
Dave Frost, just making the
conversion from basketball to
baseball, pitched the first three
innings, giving up three runs. Max
Goldstein pitched flawlessly for
the next three frames, allowing
just one hit.
The Cardinals, who were down
3-0, tied the game in the fifth
inning. Bruce Robinson started
things off by singling and stealing
second. Ken Egusa was hit by
pitcher Bob Kaczmarek. Then,
both runners moved up on a wild
pitch. Bob Hampton's ground ball
to shortstop drove in Robinson
but Egusa was tagged out on a
run-down for the second out of

the inning.
First Homer
The next batter, Mark Lucich,
knotted the game with a towering
375-foot homer to right field,
Stanford's first round-tripper this
year.
Arizona State is considered the
top team in the nation, according
to Young. The Sun Devils finished
second in last year's College World
Series, losing to USC in the finals.
However, a look at the Sun Devil
lineup will show some old faces in
new positions as seven of the nine
starters have switched positions.
Only two starting pitchers are
back in the ASU fold. They are
Greg Slocum, who was 13-1 last
year, and Jerry Umbarger, fourth
in the rotation last year. ASU's
top player is first baseman Clay
Westlake, who hit .382 last year.
* * *
Diamond Notes: Egusa reached
first base in nine of his first 10
appearances to the plate, but he
flied out and grounded out his last
two times .. . Kim Hannaford,
who was 7-8 last Saturday, was
0-3 Wednesday to lower his batting
average to .636 . . . Wednesday's
game was played in 2:35, very fast
for an early season contest. "The
guys were hustling on and off the
field," explained assistant coach
Mark Marquess.

RUGGERS TRAVEL SOUTH — Gordy Riegel (center), who along with Forrie Martin "has done a
tremendous defensive job," according to Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic, will anchor the Cardinal defense
tomorrow when Stanford meets UCLA in Los Angeles. The Bruins, defending NCAA Level II champions,
"have a lot of good foreign players," Kmetovic said, "and they have some fast backs," including football
quarterback Mark Harmon. Stanford is 4-1 on the season.
Stanford's young and
inexperienced baseball team faces
a challenge similar to taking a
final exam on the first day of
school when the Cardinals meet
Arizona State at 7:30 tonight in
Phoenix Municipal Stadium.
Stanford will play the Sun
Devils at 1 p.m. tomorrow
afternoon on the ASU campus
before going back to Phoenix for
a 7:30 night game to close out the
series.
Stanford dropped a 7-4
decision to Santa Clara
Wednesday afternoon at Sunken
Diamond in a game making up a
Tuesday afternoon rain out.
Arizona State, which won an 11-0
game with the ASU Alumni, is
opening the season against the

Cards.
"My feeling is that we're
putting the ball in play offensively
and our defense is good," said
Stanford coach Ray Young.
However the pitching aspect of
the Cardinal program is still
questionable.
Lost Lead
The Cards were leading Santa
Clara 4-3 going into the eighth
inning when the roof fell in on
Stanford ace Al Arthur. Two-run
homers by Phil Convertino and
Gene DeLyon sent the Cards to
defeat for the second time in
three games.
"It was a lack of concentration
and thinking at that point," said
Young about the two "gopher"
balls, both fast straight balls.
Catcher Dave Baker took
partial blame for the home runs,
saying that he called too many
fast balls. "The first time I
thought they would be bunting,"
said Baker. 'The next one was a
gamble that turned out to be a
bad call."
Dave Frost, just making the
conversion from basketball to
baseball, pitched the first three
innings, giving up three runs. Max
Goldstein pitched flawlessly for
the next three frames, allowing
just one hit.
The Cardinals, who were down
3-0, tied the game in the fifth
inning. Bruce Robinson started
things off by singling and stealing
second. Ken Egusa was hit by
pitcher Bob Kaczmarek. Then,
both runners moved up on a wild
pitch. Bob Hampton's ground ball
to shortstop drove in Robinson
but Egusa was tagged out on a
run-down for the second out of

the inning.
First Homer
The next batter, Mark Lucich,
knotted the game with a towering
375-foot homer to right field,
Stanford's first round-tripper this
year.
Arizona State is considered the
top team in the nation, according
to Young. The Sun Devils finished
second in last year's College World
Series, losing to USC in the finals.
However, a look at the Sun Devil
lineup will show some old faces in
new positions as seven of the nine
starters have switched positions.
Only two starting pitchers are
back in the ASU fold. They are
Greg Slocum, who was 13-1 last
year, and Jerry Umbarger, fourth
in the rotation last year. ASU's
top player is first baseman Clay
Westlake, who hit .382 last year.
* * *
Diamond Notes: Egusa reached
first base in nine of his first 10
appearances to the plate, but he
flied out and grounded out his last
two times .. . Kim Hannaford,
who was 7-8 last Saturday, was
0-3 Wednesday to lower his batting
average to .636 . . . Wednesday's
game was played in 2:35, very fast
for an early season contest. "The
guys were hustling on and off the
field," explained assistant coach
Mark Marquess.
