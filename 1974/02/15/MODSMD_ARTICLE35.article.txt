# New Setting, Same Foes For Streaking Cagers
## 
### STAN WILSON 
It's the same old story?
Hardly. The opponents are the
same this week for Howie Dallmar
and his streaking cagers, but the
similarity may end there.
The Cardinals overwhelmed
Washington 88-68 and WSU 65-51
a week ago at Maples Pavilion, but
they travel to the Northwest this
weekend where the Huskies and
Cougars, supported by
overzealous fans, enjoy a
formidable home court advantage.
Hut more importantly for
WSU, the Cougars will probably
start the Pac-B's top two scorers —
freshman center Steve Puidokas
and sophomore wingman Norton
Barnhill, neither of whom were in
the starting lineup when the Cards
trounced the Huskies on TV last
Saturday.
Barnhill, a transfer who
became eligible only last week,
came off the bench to score 23
points ap'-nst Stanford although
playing only 28 minutes, and in a
reserve role against Cal he netted
22 points, making him the
conference's unofficial leading
scorer.
Official
Puidokas' title is official. With
105 points in five games he's tied
with UCLA's Bill Walton for the
scoring lead. But Puidokas
suffered a fractured cheekbone

against Washington two weeks
ago, and missed the games against
Cal and Stanford last week. If
both Puidokas and Barnhill play
the entire game for the Cougars,
Stanford will be pressed to hold
WSU to 51 points this time.
"Anytime you lose a player of
Puidokas' capabilities it has to
hurt you," said Dallmar. "Against
the Cougars we contained
everyone except Barnhill."
The Cards carry a 3-4
conference record into the second
round of competition, and have a
mathematical shot at second
place. With a four-game win streak
on the line, Stanford will have to
win six of its last seven games to
have a chance, and the schedule is
more difficult this time around.
The Cards' only home games are
against USC and UCLA.
"We haven't been
mathematically eliminated from
contention for second place yet,
but we've got enough on our
minds just thinking about the
game in Pullman. Our confidence
is high, and I just hope we can
continue to play the way we have
our last four games," Dallmar
said.
Massive Trio
Those four games have been
highlighted by the improving play
of guards Melvin Arterberry, Jim
Montague and Mark Gilberg, and
generally dominated by the Cards'
massive front line of Rich Kelley
(7-0), Tim Patterson (6-11) and
Ed Schweitzer (6-8 1 /,:). The trio
has combined for 214 points and
129 rebounds, averages of 53.5
and 32.3.
Dallmar thinks rebounding has
been the key. "It's allowed us

bettor shots and has enabled us to
establish the game tempo we
wanted. We really aren't using the
fast break more often now — it's
just working better."
Particularly for Arterberry.
The 6-3'/2 junior has started to
score on his smooth, twisting
drives off the break, and when
Arterberry isn't scoring easy
layups, Kelley and Patterson often
are.
The Cards will start Kelley and
Schweitzer at the post positions,
Patterson at the forward spot, and
guards Arterberry and Montague.
Both the Saturday game from
Pullman and the Monday night
contest from Seattle will be
carried live on KSFO (560 AM)
starting at 8 p.m.

Cardinal Notes: UCLA leads
the Conference in
EVERYTHING: team offense,
team defense, scoring margin
(+20.8), field goal percentage, free
throw percentage, and rebounding
margin. Bruin Keith Wilkes
currently leads the nation in free
throw shooting, and is tops in the
Pac-8, connecting on 90 percent
(27-30).
The TV game of the week,
tomorrow afternoon on Channel
2, features UCLA against Oregon
in Eugene.
Coach Billy Jones' JV team,
now 7-5 on the season, also uoasts
a four-game win streak. Marty
Moroski leads the team in scoring
with 15.6 average followed by
Sven Walker (11.8), Scott Russell
(11.7) and Terry McCartin (10.8).
The JV, idle this weekend, returns
to action next week with games
against Santa Clara and San Jose
State.

It's the same old story?
Hardly. The opponents are the
same this week for Howie Dallmar
and his streaking cagers, but the
similarity may end there.
The Cardinals overwhelmed
Washington 88-68 and WSU 65-51
a week ago at Maples Pavilion, but
they travel to the Northwest this
weekend where the Huskies and
Cougars, supported by
overzealous fans, enjoy a
formidable home court advantage.
Hut more importantly for
WSU, the Cougars will probably
start the Pac-B's top two scorers —
freshman center Steve Puidokas
and sophomore wingman Norton
Barnhill, neither of whom were in
the starting lineup when the Cards
trounced the Huskies on TV last
Saturday.
Barnhill, a transfer who
became eligible only last week,
came off the bench to score 23
points ap'-nst Stanford although
playing only 28 minutes, and in a
reserve role against Cal he netted
22 points, making him the
conference's unofficial leading
scorer.
Official
Puidokas' title is official. With
105 points in five games he's tied
with UCLA's Bill Walton for the
scoring lead. But Puidokas
suffered a fractured cheekbone

against Washington two weeks
ago, and missed the games against
Cal and Stanford last week. If
both Puidokas and Barnhill play
the entire game for the Cougars,
Stanford will be pressed to hold
WSU to 51 points this time.
"Anytime you lose a player of
Puidokas' capabilities it has to
hurt you," said Dallmar. "Against
the Cougars we contained
everyone except Barnhill."
The Cards carry a 3-4
conference record into the second
round of competition, and have a
mathematical shot at second
place. With a four-game win streak
on the line, Stanford will have to
win six of its last seven games to
have a chance, and the schedule is
more difficult this time around.
The Cards' only home games are
against USC and UCLA.
"We haven't been
mathematically eliminated from
contention for second place yet,
but we've got enough on our
minds just thinking about the
game in Pullman. Our confidence
is high, and I just hope we can
continue to play the way we have
our last four games," Dallmar
said.
Massive Trio
Those four games have been
highlighted by the improving play
of guards Melvin Arterberry, Jim
Montague and Mark Gilberg, and
generally dominated by the Cards'
massive front line of Rich Kelley
(7-0), Tim Patterson (6-11) and
Ed Schweitzer (6-8 1 /,:). The trio
has combined for 214 points and
129 rebounds, averages of 53.5
and 32.3.
Dallmar thinks rebounding has
been the key. "It's allowed us

bettor shots and has enabled us to
establish the game tempo we
wanted. We really aren't using the
fast break more often now — it's
just working better."
Particularly for Arterberry.
The 6-3'/2 junior has started to
score on his smooth, twisting
drives off the break, and when
Arterberry isn't scoring easy
layups, Kelley and Patterson often
are.
The Cards will start Kelley and
Schweitzer at the post positions,
Patterson at the forward spot, and
guards Arterberry and Montague.
Both the Saturday game from
Pullman and the Monday night
contest from Seattle will be
carried live on KSFO (560 AM)
starting at 8 p.m.

Hardly. The opponents are the
same this week for Howie Dallmar
and his streaking cagers, but the
similarity may end there.
The Cardinals overwhelmed
Washington 88-68 and WSU 65-51
a week ago at Maples Pavilion, but
they travel to the Northwest this
weekend where the Huskies and
Cougars, supported by
overzealous fans, enjoy a
formidable home court advantage.
Hut more importantly for
WSU, the Cougars will probably
start the Pac-B's top two scorers —
freshman center Steve Puidokas
and sophomore wingman Norton
Barnhill, neither of whom were in
the starting lineup when the Cards
trounced the Huskies on TV last
Saturday.
Barnhill, a transfer who
became eligible only last week,
came off the bench to score 23
points ap'-nst Stanford although
playing only 28 minutes, and in a
reserve role against Cal he netted
22 points, making him the
conference's unofficial leading
scorer.
Official
Puidokas' title is official. With
105 points in five games he's tied
with UCLA's Bill Walton for the
scoring lead. But Puidokas
suffered a fractured cheekbone

against Washington two weeks
ago, and missed the games against
Cal and Stanford last week. If
both Puidokas and Barnhill play
the entire game for the Cougars,
Stanford will be pressed to hold
WSU to 51 points this time.
"Anytime you lose a player of
Puidokas' capabilities it has to
hurt you," said Dallmar. "Against
the Cougars we contained
everyone except Barnhill."
The Cards carry a 3-4
conference record into the second
round of competition, and have a
mathematical shot at second
place. With a four-game win streak
on the line, Stanford will have to
win six of its last seven games to
have a chance, and the schedule is
more difficult this time around.
The Cards' only home games are
against USC and UCLA.
"We haven't been
mathematically eliminated from
contention for second place yet,
but we've got enough on our
minds just thinking about the
game in Pullman. Our confidence
is high, and I just hope we can
continue to play the way we have
our last four games," Dallmar
said.
Massive Trio
Those four games have been
highlighted by the improving play
of guards Melvin Arterberry, Jim
Montague and Mark Gilberg, and
generally dominated by the Cards'
massive front line of Rich Kelley
(7-0), Tim Patterson (6-11) and
Ed Schweitzer (6-8 1 /,:). The trio
has combined for 214 points and
129 rebounds, averages of 53.5
and 32.3.
Dallmar thinks rebounding has
been the key. "It's allowed us

bettor shots and has enabled us to
establish the game tempo we
wanted. We really aren't using the
fast break more often now — it's
just working better."
Particularly for Arterberry.
The 6-3'/2 junior has started to
score on his smooth, twisting
drives off the break, and when
Arterberry isn't scoring easy
layups, Kelley and Patterson often
are.
The Cards will start Kelley and
Schweitzer at the post positions,
Patterson at the forward spot, and
guards Arterberry and Montague.
Both the Saturday game from
Pullman and the Monday night
contest from Seattle will be
carried live on KSFO (560 AM)
starting at 8 p.m.

Cardinal Notes: UCLA leads
the Conference in
EVERYTHING: team offense,
team defense, scoring margin
(+20.8), field goal percentage, free
throw percentage, and rebounding
margin. Bruin Keith Wilkes
currently leads the nation in free
throw shooting, and is tops in the
Pac-8, connecting on 90 percent
(27-30).
The TV game of the week,
tomorrow afternoon on Channel
2, features UCLA against Oregon
in Eugene.
Coach Billy Jones' JV team,
now 7-5 on the season, also uoasts
a four-game win streak. Marty
Moroski leads the team in scoring
with 15.6 average followed by
Sven Walker (11.8), Scott Russell
(11.7) and Terry McCartin (10.8).
The JV, idle this weekend, returns
to action next week with games
against Santa Clara and San Jose
State.
