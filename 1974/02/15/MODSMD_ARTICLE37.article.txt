survived the regular season
undefeated.
They will be joined in the
playoffs by once-beaten Biz I Al,
ATO, Biz II A, Med School, Theta
Delt "ALL and SAE.
In this week's action, Shakey's
edged the Theta Delts 6-5 in the
second sudden-death tie-breaker.
The game, tied 1-1 at the end of
regulation play, went through
seven penalty kicks on both sides
before the outcome was
determined.
In other soccer action, Biz II
A, last year's semi-finalists, snuck
into the playoffs with a 3-0
whitewash of JR A.
The Mighty Mites crawled into the intramural basketball playoffs
with a 61-33 rout of Biz I A 2. "Hold the" Mayo led the Mites with 26
points.

the Mites. "Woody" Woodward topped the Biz scoring with 12.
In other games, last year's "B" runnerups, Rinc 69, ran it up again
with a 102-40 rout of the Lakers. Don Hunt led Rinc with 39 points,

points-per-game over the regular season.
Bill "The Hack" Thacker led the Lakers, with 18 points.
Unfortunately, for the Lakers, Rinc 69 did not sport any female stars.
Elsewhere, the Singing Seven harmonized their way into the
playoffs by edging the Zeros 39-36. Vic Miramontes, known to his
friends as B-flat, scored eight second-half points to lead the Singers

convert technical foul shots for a
58-39 victory and a playoff berth.
Roger Still well pumped in 21
points and sacked the opposing
center five times. Mike Yee led
the JRA's with 15 points.
The Zetes clinched a tourney

Craig Johnson's 20 and Ted
Pappas' 21 points.
The Dekes completed a perfect
season Monday with a 62-29
crushing of the Beta's. Bob Brain's
16 points topped the Deke
