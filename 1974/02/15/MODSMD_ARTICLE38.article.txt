Possible Lead In Hearst Kidnap
BERKELEY — Authorities were reported last
night to be investigating an escaped convict
nicknamed "Cinque," a leader in the terrorist group
which kidnaped Patricia Hearst.
The San Francisco Chronicle and television
station KQED said the man is Donald David
DeFreeze, 30, a name the FBI said was known to
them in connection with the Symbionese Liberation
Army, although "he is not a prime suspect at this
time." DeFreeze escaped from Soledad Prison last
March 5 while serving a term for robbery, assault
and possession of stolen checks, the state
Department of Corrections confirmed.
John Kelley, assistant in charge of the San
Francisco FBI office, said DeFreeze is "one of
several people who are known to have used the alias
'Cinque.' "
A male voice who said his name was Cinque was
included in a tape recording mailed to the family
last Tuesday through a radio station. Cinque
threatened that Hearst would be executed unless the
SLA's demands were complied with.
Earlier in the day, the father of Patricia Hearst
denounced as "damn near irresponsible" a comment
by Atty. Gen. William Saxbe that if authorities
located the kidnaped newspaper heiress "they'd go
get her."
FEO Announces Fuel Crackdown
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office
announced yesterday moves to direct more fuel
immediately to the trucking industry and to crack
down on propane price-gouging.
There were still no decisions on gasoline
rationing or redistributions. FEO Deputy
Administrator John C. Sawhill said the agency was
sending teams into 20 states and the District of
Columbia in an effort to verify gasoline supply data.
Only after that is done, said Sawhill, can the
FEO decide how to shift supplies around to alleviate
apparent imbalances among the states.

Sawhill told a news conference here:
— The FEO found that petroleum imports
averaged some 4.9 million barrels a day last week,
just about the level expected under the Arab oil
embargo, but some 500,000 barrels a day higher
than reported Wednesday by the American
Petroleum Institute, an industry group.
— All major oil companies were directed to
adjust diesel fuel and gasoline allocations to give the
trucking industry all the fuel it needs.
"Where necessary, you are directed to make
interim allocations in order to meet truckers'
immediate needs," a telegram to the companies said.
Solzhenitsyn Travels To Zurich
LANGENBROICH, Germany — Exiled Soviet
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn will fly to Zurich
today, his lawyer said. He did not give the purpose
of the visit to the Swiss city.
The Russian Nobel laureate's Swiss attorney, Dr.
Fritz Heeb, made the announcement yesterday, 10
hours after he arrived at the country retreat of
German writer Heinrich 8011, where Solzhenitsyn is
staying.
Heeb declined any further comment, and asked
the crowd of newsmen to "allow Mr. Solzhenitsyn
and Mr. 801 l a restful night." Langenbroich is a
town of 23 houses and 100 inhabitants about 35
miles from Bonn. There were about 100 newsmen
keeping a vigil outside the 801 l home.
Invitations to live in various countries have been
pouring in to Solzhenitsyn's temporary refuge. Heeb
has previously indicated Solzhenitsyn may settle in
Scandinavia.
Nine prominent Soviet dissidents, including
physicist Andrei Sakharov, issued a statement
yesterday demanding that Solzhenitsyn be allowed
to return to his native land.
Nixon Refuses To Produce Tapes
WASHINGTON — Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski told the Senate yesterday the White House
has refused to turn over more material for his
Watergate investigations. The White House
confirmed it and said the order came from President
Nixon.
"It is now clear that evidence I deem material to
our investigations will not be forthcoming,"
Jaworski wrote Sen. James O. Eastland, D-Miss.,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee.
A committee member, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., immediately urged Eastland to call a
meeting "to consider the ominous implications of
Mr. Jaworski's letter." He said the prosecutor
should be given the opportunity to testify.
Jaworski said he had been informed by letter
"that the President has refused to reconsider his
earlier decision to terminate his cooperation with
this investigation, at least with regard to producing
any tape recordings of presidential conversations."
At the Florida White House, Deputy Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon had decided
that material already supplied to Jaworski was

sufficient to allow the grand juries to proceed with
their work without delay.
Reagan Favors New Gas Plan
SACRAMENTO — A contingency plan for an
Oregon-style system of voluntary gasoline
purchasing was approved yesterday by Gov. Ronald
Reagan. Reagan said Californians will first be asked
to reduce their consumption voluntarily, and the
"marketing plan" will be used only if it becomes
necessary.
"We will be issuing a statement on the amount of
reduction everyone should make so that everyone
will have plenty," Reagan told newsmen after a
cabinet meeting.
He said the statement could be made today.
Julie Undergoes Operation
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — Julie Nixon Eisenhower
successfully underwent a 44-minute major operation
last night to stop internal bleeding from an ovarian
cyst, hospital officials said.
Doctors at Indiana University Medical Center
removed the benign ovarian cyst from the
25-year-old daughter of President Nixon and
stopped the internal bleeding which had caused the
operation, ? spokesman said.
"Although Julie is experiencing some
postoperative discomfort and pain, she is awake and
her doctors consider her condition satisfactory,"

He said she would remain in the hospital for a
week to 10 days.
Gas Dealers Approve Shutdown
FRESNO — Leaders of California gasoline dealer
groups agreed yesterday to shut down March 22
unless the government lets them increase profit
margins.
If they take a "vacation," they plan to ask
operators throughout the nation to join them.
They'll demand that the federal Cost of Living
Council allow a 25 percent gross profit on retail
gasoline sales, the level they said was traditional
until price controls were imposed last June.
The station owners, representing 3400 of
California's 20,000 dealers, decided against pumping
their tanks dry and taking a "vacation" Feb. 24 as
planned by a Southern California group. Art Paul of
Carson, vice president of that association, said he
will ask his 300 members whether they want to
stick with that target date or wait until March.

Gas Dealers Approve Shutdown
FRESNO — Leaders of California gasoline dealer
groups agreed yesterday to shut down March 22
unless the government lets them increase profit
margins.
If they take a "vacation," they plan to ask
operators throughout the nation to join them.
They'll demand that the federal Cost of Living
Council allow a 25 percent gross profit on retail
gasoline sales, the level they said was traditional
until price controls were imposed last June.
The station owners, representing 3400 of
California's 20,000 dealers, decided against pumping
their tanks dry and taking a "vacation" Feb. 24 as
planned by a Southern California group. Art Paul of
Carson, vice president of that association, said he
will ask his 300 members whether they want to
stick with that target date or wait until March.

Possible Lead In Hearst Kidnap
BERKELEY — Authorities were reported last
night to be investigating an escaped convict
nicknamed "Cinque," a leader in the terrorist group
which kidnaped Patricia Hearst.
The San Francisco Chronicle and television
station KQED said the man is Donald David
DeFreeze, 30, a name the FBI said was known to
them in connection with the Symbionese Liberation
Army, although "he is not a prime suspect at this
time." DeFreeze escaped from Soledad Prison last
March 5 while serving a term for robbery, assault
and possession of stolen checks, the state
Department of Corrections confirmed.
John Kelley, assistant in charge of the San
Francisco FBI office, said DeFreeze is "one of
several people who are known to have used the alias
'Cinque.' "
A male voice who said his name was Cinque was
included in a tape recording mailed to the family
last Tuesday through a radio station. Cinque
threatened that Hearst would be executed unless the
SLA's demands were complied with.
Earlier in the day, the father of Patricia Hearst
denounced as "damn near irresponsible" a comment
by Atty. Gen. William Saxbe that if authorities
located the kidnaped newspaper heiress "they'd go
get her."
FEO Announces Fuel Crackdown
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office
announced yesterday moves to direct more fuel
immediately to the trucking industry and to crack
down on propane price-gouging.
There were still no decisions on gasoline
rationing or redistributions. FEO Deputy
Administrator John C. Sawhill said the agency was
sending teams into 20 states and the District of
Columbia in an effort to verify gasoline supply data.
Only after that is done, said Sawhill, can the
FEO decide how to shift supplies around to alleviate
apparent imbalances among the states.

Sawhill told a news conference here:
— The FEO found that petroleum imports
averaged some 4.9 million barrels a day last week,
just about the level expected under the Arab oil
embargo, but some 500,000 barrels a day higher
than reported Wednesday by the American
Petroleum Institute, an industry group.
— All major oil companies were directed to
adjust diesel fuel and gasoline allocations to give the
trucking industry all the fuel it needs.
"Where necessary, you are directed to make
interim allocations in order to meet truckers'
immediate needs," a telegram to the companies said.
Solzhenitsyn Travels To Zurich
LANGENBROICH, Germany — Exiled Soviet
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn will fly to Zurich
today, his lawyer said. He did not give the purpose
of the visit to the Swiss city.
The Russian Nobel laureate's Swiss attorney, Dr.
Fritz Heeb, made the announcement yesterday, 10
hours after he arrived at the country retreat of
German writer Heinrich 8011, where Solzhenitsyn is
staying.
Heeb declined any further comment, and asked
the crowd of newsmen to "allow Mr. Solzhenitsyn
and Mr. 801 l a restful night." Langenbroich is a
town of 23 houses and 100 inhabitants about 35
miles from Bonn. There were about 100 newsmen
keeping a vigil outside the 801 l home.
Invitations to live in various countries have been
pouring in to Solzhenitsyn's temporary refuge. Heeb
has previously indicated Solzhenitsyn may settle in
Scandinavia.
Nine prominent Soviet dissidents, including
physicist Andrei Sakharov, issued a statement
yesterday demanding that Solzhenitsyn be allowed
to return to his native land.
Nixon Refuses To Produce Tapes
WASHINGTON — Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski told the Senate yesterday the White House
has refused to turn over more material for his
Watergate investigations. The White House
confirmed it and said the order came from President
Nixon.
"It is now clear that evidence I deem material to
our investigations will not be forthcoming,"
Jaworski wrote Sen. James O. Eastland, D-Miss.,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee.
A committee member, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., immediately urged Eastland to call a
meeting "to consider the ominous implications of
Mr. Jaworski's letter." He said the prosecutor
should be given the opportunity to testify.
Jaworski said he had been informed by letter
"that the President has refused to reconsider his
earlier decision to terminate his cooperation with
this investigation, at least with regard to producing
any tape recordings of presidential conversations."
At the Florida White House, Deputy Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon had decided
that material already supplied to Jaworski was

sufficient to allow the grand juries to proceed with
their work without delay.
Reagan Favors New Gas Plan
SACRAMENTO — A contingency plan for an
Oregon-style system of voluntary gasoline
purchasing was approved yesterday by Gov. Ronald
Reagan. Reagan said Californians will first be asked
to reduce their consumption voluntarily, and the
"marketing plan" will be used only if it becomes
necessary.
"We will be issuing a statement on the amount of
reduction everyone should make so that everyone
will have plenty," Reagan told newsmen after a
cabinet meeting.
He said the statement could be made today.

Nixon Refuses To Produce Tapes
WASHINGTON — Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski told the Senate yesterday the White House
has refused to turn over more material for his
Watergate investigations. The White House
confirmed it and said the order came from President
Nixon.
"It is now clear that evidence I deem material to
our investigations will not be forthcoming,"
Jaworski wrote Sen. James O. Eastland, D-Miss.,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee.
A committee member, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., immediately urged Eastland to call a
meeting "to consider the ominous implications of
Mr. Jaworski's letter." He said the prosecutor
should be given the opportunity to testify.
Jaworski said he had been informed by letter
"that the President has refused to reconsider his
earlier decision to terminate his cooperation with
this investigation, at least with regard to producing
any tape recordings of presidential conversations."
At the Florida White House, Deputy Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon had decided
that material already supplied to Jaworski was

sufficient to allow the grand juries to proceed with
their work without delay.

"We will be issuing a statement on the amount of
reduction everyone should make so that everyone
will have plenty," Reagan told newsmen after a
cabinet meeting.
He said the statement could be made today.

successfully underwent a 44-minute major operation
last night to stop internal bleeding from an ovarian
cyst, hospital officials said.

removed the benign ovarian cyst from the
25-year-old daughter of President Nixon and

Gas Dealers Approve Shutdown
FRESNO — Leaders of California gasoline dealer
groups agreed yesterday to shut down March 22
unless the government lets them increase profit
margins.
If they take a "vacation," they plan to ask
operators throughout the nation to join them.
They'll demand that the federal Cost of Living
Council allow a 25 percent gross profit on retail
gasoline sales, the level they said was traditional
until price controls were imposed last June.
The station owners, representing 3400 of
California's 20,000 dealers, decided against pumping
their tanks dry and taking a "vacation" Feb. 24 as
planned by a Southern California group. Art Paul of
Carson, vice president of that association, said he
will ask his 300 members whether they want to
stick with that target date or wait until March.

Possible Lead In Hearst Kidnap
BERKELEY — Authorities were reported last
night to be investigating an escaped convict
nicknamed "Cinque," a leader in the terrorist group
which kidnaped Patricia Hearst.
The San Francisco Chronicle and television
station KQED said the man is Donald David
DeFreeze, 30, a name the FBI said was known to
them in connection with the Symbionese Liberation
Army, although "he is not a prime suspect at this
time." DeFreeze escaped from Soledad Prison last
March 5 while serving a term for robbery, assault
and possession of stolen checks, the state
Department of Corrections confirmed.
John Kelley, assistant in charge of the San
Francisco FBI office, said DeFreeze is "one of
several people who are known to have used the alias
'Cinque.' "
A male voice who said his name was Cinque was
included in a tape recording mailed to the family
last Tuesday through a radio station. Cinque
threatened that Hearst would be executed unless the
SLA's demands were complied with.
Earlier in the day, the father of Patricia Hearst
denounced as "damn near irresponsible" a comment
by Atty. Gen. William Saxbe that if authorities
located the kidnaped newspaper heiress "they'd go
get her."
FEO Announces Fuel Crackdown
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office
announced yesterday moves to direct more fuel
immediately to the trucking industry and to crack
down on propane price-gouging.
There were still no decisions on gasoline
rationing or redistributions. FEO Deputy
Administrator John C. Sawhill said the agency was
sending teams into 20 states and the District of
Columbia in an effort to verify gasoline supply data.
Only after that is done, said Sawhill, can the
FEO decide how to shift supplies around to alleviate
apparent imbalances among the states.

Sawhill told a news conference here:
— The FEO found that petroleum imports
averaged some 4.9 million barrels a day last week,
just about the level expected under the Arab oil
embargo, but some 500,000 barrels a day higher
than reported Wednesday by the American
Petroleum Institute, an industry group.
— All major oil companies were directed to
adjust diesel fuel and gasoline allocations to give the
trucking industry all the fuel it needs.
"Where necessary, you are directed to make
interim allocations in order to meet truckers'
immediate needs," a telegram to the companies said.
Solzhenitsyn Travels To Zurich
LANGENBROICH, Germany — Exiled Soviet
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn will fly to Zurich
today, his lawyer said. He did not give the purpose
of the visit to the Swiss city.
The Russian Nobel laureate's Swiss attorney, Dr.
Fritz Heeb, made the announcement yesterday, 10
hours after he arrived at the country retreat of
German writer Heinrich 8011, where Solzhenitsyn is
staying.
Heeb declined any further comment, and asked
the crowd of newsmen to "allow Mr. Solzhenitsyn
and Mr. 801 l a restful night." Langenbroich is a
town of 23 houses and 100 inhabitants about 35
miles from Bonn. There were about 100 newsmen
keeping a vigil outside the 801 l home.
Invitations to live in various countries have been
pouring in to Solzhenitsyn's temporary refuge. Heeb

rationing or redistributions. FEO Deputy
Administrator John C. Sawhill said the agency was
sending teams into 20 states and the District of
Columbia in an effort to verify gasoline supply data.
Only after that is done, said Sawhill, can the
FEO decide how to shift supplies around to alleviate
apparent imbalances among the states.

Sawhill told a news conference here:
— The FEO found that petroleum imports
averaged some 4.9 million barrels a day last week,
just about the level expected under the Arab oil
embargo, but some 500,000 barrels a day higher
than reported Wednesday by the American
Petroleum Institute, an industry group.
— All major oil companies were directed to
adjust diesel fuel and gasoline allocations to give the
trucking industry all the fuel it needs.
"Where necessary, you are directed to make
interim allocations in order to meet truckers'
immediate needs," a telegram to the companies said.
Solzhenitsyn Travels To Zurich
LANGENBROICH, Germany — Exiled Soviet
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn will fly to Zurich
today, his lawyer said. He did not give the purpose
of the visit to the Swiss city.
The Russian Nobel laureate's Swiss attorney, Dr.
Fritz Heeb, made the announcement yesterday, 10
hours after he arrived at the country retreat of
German writer Heinrich 8011, where Solzhenitsyn is
staying.
Heeb declined any further comment, and asked
the crowd of newsmen to "allow Mr. Solzhenitsyn
and Mr. 801 l a restful night." Langenbroich is a
town of 23 houses and 100 inhabitants about 35
miles from Bonn. There were about 100 newsmen
keeping a vigil outside the 801 l home.
Invitations to live in various countries have been
pouring in to Solzhenitsyn's temporary refuge. Heeb
has previously indicated Solzhenitsyn may settle in
Scandinavia.
Nine prominent Soviet dissidents, including
physicist Andrei Sakharov, issued a statement
yesterday demanding that Solzhenitsyn be allowed
to return to his native land.
Nixon Refuses To Produce Tapes
WASHINGTON — Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski told the Senate yesterday the White House
has refused to turn over more material for his
Watergate investigations. The White House
confirmed it and said the order came from President
Nixon.
"It is now clear that evidence I deem material to
our investigations will not be forthcoming,"
Jaworski wrote Sen. James O. Eastland, D-Miss.,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee.
A committee member, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., immediately urged Eastland to call a
meeting "to consider the ominous implications of
Mr. Jaworski's letter." He said the prosecutor
should be given the opportunity to testify.
Jaworski said he had been informed by letter
"that the President has refused to reconsider his
earlier decision to terminate his cooperation with
this investigation, at least with regard to producing
any tape recordings of presidential conversations."
At the Florida White House, Deputy Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon had decided
that material already supplied to Jaworski was

sufficient to allow the grand juries to proceed with
their work without delay.
Reagan Favors New Gas Plan
SACRAMENTO — A contingency plan for an
Oregon-style system of voluntary gasoline
purchasing was approved yesterday by Gov. Ronald
Reagan. Reagan said Californians will first be asked
to reduce their consumption voluntarily, and the
"marketing plan" will be used only if it becomes
necessary.
"We will be issuing a statement on the amount of
reduction everyone should make so that everyone
will have plenty," Reagan told newsmen after a
cabinet meeting.
He said the statement could be made today.
Julie Undergoes Operation
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — Julie Nixon Eisenhower
successfully underwent a 44-minute major operation
last night to stop internal bleeding from an ovarian
cyst, hospital officials said.
Doctors at Indiana University Medical Center
removed the benign ovarian cyst from the
25-year-old daughter of President Nixon and
stopped the internal bleeding which had caused the
operation, ? spokesman said.
"Although Julie is experiencing some
postoperative discomfort and pain, she is awake and
her doctors consider her condition satisfactory,"
hospital spokesman Harrison J. Ullmann said.
He said she would remain in the hospital for a
week to 10 days.
Gas Dealers Approve Shutdown
FRESNO — Leaders of California gasoline dealer
groups agreed yesterday to shut down March 22
unless the government lets them increase profit
margins.
If they take a "vacation," they plan to ask
operators throughout the nation to join them.
They'll demand that the federal Cost of Living
Council allow a 25 percent gross profit on retail
gasoline sales, the level they said was traditional
until price controls were imposed last June.
The station owners, representing 3400 of
California's 20,000 dealers, decided against pumping
their tanks dry and taking a "vacation" Feb. 24 as
planned by a Southern California group. Art Paul of
Carson, vice president of that association, said he
will ask his 300 members whether they want to
stick with that target date or wait until March.
