# Former Venceremos Leaders Deny Charges Of SLA Ties
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Former Venceremos members have
heatedly denied that their recently
disbanded group has any ties with the
Symbionese Liberation (SLA) as was
alleged in a three-part story distributed
by the Copley News Service and
printed by the Palo Alto Times this
week.
The SLA has claimed responsibility
for the assassination last fall of
Oakland School Superintendent
Marcus Foster and for the kidnaping
of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.
According to the Copley News
Service stories, "state and federal
investigators believe they [the SLA]
are an offshoot of a Maoist guerilla
organization named Venceremos."
Fired Stanford Assoc. English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin, a former member of
Venceremos' central committee, called
the allegation "preposterous" and"the
wildest kind of fantasy."
Franklin said the Copley stories
were "playing into the hands of
the police," adding that the attempts
to tie the SLA to Venceremos could
"set the stage for an attack, not only
on the left, but on the black
community as well."
Investigation Results
According to the first part of the
series, which appeared in Monday's
Palo Alto Times, "An intensive
investigation has led state and federal
investigators to the conclusion that the
majority of the revolutionary groups
now doing business in the United
States are joining together â€” many of
them under the protective wing of
Venceremos."
The story which appeared Tuesday
said "Venceremos is suspected" of
hiding one of the people allegedly
connected with Foster's assassination
and of hiding attorney Stephen
Bingham, who allegedly smuggled the
pistol into San Quentin Prison that led
to the slaying of three guards and the
killing of George Jackson.
The article also said that "a
confidential report" indicates that
Venceremos was involved in the Aug.
7, 1970 shoot-out at Marin County
courthouse that left Superior Court
Judge Harold Haley, Jonathan Jackson
and two others dead.
Single Source
Most of the information in the
Copley News Service story appears to

have come from San Quentin
investigating sergeant William Hankins,
who said that Venceremos' claim that
it disbanded in September, 1973 is
"bull." Hankins is the only law
enforcement official quoted or
referred to by name in any of the
three parts of the series.
It was Hankins who said that "the
Symbionese Liberation Army is
probably one of" the small terrorist
groups formed out of Venceremos "to
continue their acts of terrorism."
But John T. Kelly, assistant special
agent in charge of the FBl's San
Francisco office, said, "We're still
trying to determine who the leadership
and the membership [of the SLA) is.
Until we know for sure, the
information won't be disseminated."
Statements published by
Venceremos as long ago as 1971, as
well as more recent public protests
from former members of the group,
seem to indicate that the ideologies of
the SLA and Venceremos are
incompatible. One long-time observer
of local radical activity said "it is not
conceivable that anyone holding the
Venceremos ideology would be
involved" in SLA-type activities.
Black Panthers Criticized
An article published in the Sept. 1,
1971 issue of Pamoja Venceremos, the
organization's official newspaper,
criticized a faction of the Black
Panther Party which then wanted to
devote all of its energies to so-called
"military" activities, while ignoring
efforts at raising the political
consciousness of the masses.
The Venceremos paper said this
course of action would make it
"impossible for the illegal party to use
the existing mass organizations, thus
cutting off its life blood." The SLA is
an entirely underground organization
which relies solely upon military
activities, and is therefore considered
"counter-revolutionary" by former
Venceremos members.
Former Venceremos member
Tomas Pillsbury, now running for San
Mateo County Sheriff, said at a San
Francisco press conference Wednesday
that the SLA is "anti-working class,
anti-revolutionary and
anti-communist." He also said, "If the
SLA did not exist, the police would
have to invent them."
Pillsbury insisted that Venceremos

had indeed broken up and that it was
not an umbrella organization for other
revolutionary groups.
The Copley story identified Joseph
M. Rcmiro, who is in custody for the
Foster assassination, as a member of
both the SLA and Venceremos. But
Franklin said "I had never heard of
him before his name appeared in the
papers. And the same thing is true for
the other people involved."
