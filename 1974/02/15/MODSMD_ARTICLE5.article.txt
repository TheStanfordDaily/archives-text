# Frats Stress Variety, Dedication

### SANDY WHITE 
Last Of Three Parts
As a member of an exclusive and
prestigious organization, the fraternity
man has been typically afforded a
certain amount of anonymity in his
actions. The many fraternity pranks
over the years have ranged from
carrying off all the girls from Hurlburt
House, and driving a firetruck into the
lake bed, to forcibly shaving the head
of former ASSU president David
Harris.
Those are the incidents that make
the news and foster statements like:
"some of the biggest moral lepers 11 ]
ever knew were members of Stanford
fraternities." That was the opinion of
Bob Chandler, a Daily columnist who
urged abolition of fraternities in 1946.
But is this image accurate? What are
fraternities like in 1974?
Current Sigma Chi president John
Mueller doesn't like an image of
irresponsibility. "Frankly, I think
some of the best men on campus live
in fraternities," he said recently,
referring to scholastic and athletic
achievement and student leadership.
"You have to look at it in terms of
fun," remarks Phi Delt Frank Uribie.
Whether a fraternity is rowdy on
the weekends or not, frat life is not
always one continuous orgy of beer.
SAE president Ken Krebs says, "It's
kind of rare to get together and drink
beer, but we do have stag nights
sometimes. It's not like there's always
something going on."
Parties 'Every Other Weekend'
Although the Phi Delts have a party
"every other weekend," says Uribie,
"it's not like anyone is discouraged
from studying."
Part of initiation this year was a

community service project, according
to Uribie. The pledges fixed up a
house for the blind.
Krebs describes Stanford
fraternities in general as "not rah-rah
gung-ho like those in the South or
Southern California." Though many
people think of fraternity brothers as
jocks or frat-rats, Mueller insists that it
is unfair to stereotype. "People in
theme houses could probably be
stereotyped more than fraternities,
because they have the same interests.
You can call some frats rowdy, others
athletically or scholastically based, but
you can't call any one house a
jock-house."
Bands And Mountain Climbers
Stanford's diversity spreads to its
fraternities. Peter Sylvester of the
General Secretary's Office says that
the Alpha Delts were always well
known for their band, the Alpha Sigs
were mountain climbers, and the old
Alpha Kappa Lambdas had the highest
grade point average of all fraternities.
National fraternity organizations
have found Stanford chapters often go
their own way.
But the nationals have learned to
tolerate local autonomy, which is a
common practice across the nation,
according to Mueller of Sigma Chi. He
does, however, cite several advantages
of belonging to the national
organization: members can receive
scholarships and loans, executive
secretaries are available to help with
rush and committees, and local
chapters are encouraged to take part in
community affairs.
One great advantage, says Mueller,
is the common experience shared by
all members of a single fraternity.
The initiation rituals of a fraternity

are secret, and they are identical for
every chapter. "The officers really
take it seriously," states Uribie.
"Sigma Chi was founded on lofty
ideals," says Mueller.
Fraternity alumni get together with
their "brothers" often, and with the
undergraduate members once a year.
Most frat men admit that such lifelong
commitment to the organization is a
major reason for joining.
The pledge knows, claims Uribie,
that when he is initiated, he will be a
Phi Delt "for the rest of his life."
Mueller estimates that "99 percent of
those who are initiated are glad they
were."
Commitment
Gary DeSmet of Sigma Chi calls the
fraternity "a more real situation than a
dorm" because one makes a
commitment to the fraternity, helps
maintain the house, solves budget
problems, and helps with rush. "The
fraternity house reflects the people
who live there, and I'm proud of this
house," DeSmet said.
Fraternities were at the height of
unpopularity during the late '60s and
1970, which was the all-time low
pledge year for many. But they are on
the way back now.
Last year, the Phi Delts had a
pledge class of about 15, and few frats
had to recruit members. Uribie says,
"I've always considered fraternities a
part of college life." But the fraternity
of today has changed, even if only as a
product of changing times, as SAE's
Krebs suggests.
No Discrimination
Today's fraternity cannot
discriminate against prospective
pledges on the basis of race or religion
without causing an uproar among
other fraternities and all students.
Some frats have entered the draw,
such as Theta Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi.
A few houses currently in the draw
are still considered fraternities only
because they maintain alumni ties.
Lambda Nu (formerly Alpha Kappa
Lambda), a prime example, is coed
and in the draw; its members do not
consider the house a frat, but they still
meet with AKL alumni once a year.
Rush System
There are now only 12 all-male
fraternities which use the rush system
for member selection.
Mueller says no new fraternities are
allowed to build on campus and
conjectures that all the current ones
will remain.
"The University does not love us,
nor does it hate us," states Mueller.
"Fraternities are regarded as an

alternate living style, and so they are
tolerated." Sylvester says he hopes for
"a stronger, more diversified fraternity
system at Stanford."
In 'The Purpose and Meaning of
College Fraternities," Charles P.
Steinmetz wrote that "the fraternity,
based on the family idea, should be a
most powerful influence towards all
that is desirable in college life." Ernest
Lewis, a pioneer Phi Delt, called upon
fraternities to "assist in sowing those
seeds that shall grow and ripen into
perfected manhood."
Krebs modernizes the definition,
calling the fraternity "a living group of
people like yourself, with whom you
can get along." Perhaps this indicates
the current status of frats - the pranks
are still played, the members are still
proud, but the atmosphere seems more
open, more easy-going, and certainly
not as pompous as in the early years.

prestigious organization, the fraternity
man has been typically afforded a
certain amount of anonymity in his
actions. The many fraternity pranks
over the years have ranged from
carrying off all the girls from Hurlburt
House, and driving a firetruck into the
lake bed, to forcibly shaving the head
of former ASSU president David
Harris.
Those are the incidents that make
the news and foster statements like:
"some of the biggest moral lepers 11 ]
ever knew were members of Stanford
fraternities." That was the opinion of
Bob Chandler, a Daily columnist who
urged abolition of fraternities in 1946.
But is this image accurate? What are
fraternities like in 1974?
Current Sigma Chi president John
Mueller doesn't like an image of
irresponsibility. "Frankly, I think
some of the best men on campus live
in fraternities," he said recently,
referring to scholastic and athletic
achievement and student leadership.
"You have to look at it in terms of
fun," remarks Phi Delt Frank Uribie.
Whether a fraternity is rowdy on
the weekends or not, frat life is not
always one continuous orgy of beer.
SAE president Ken Krebs says, "It's
kind of rare to get together and drink
beer, but we do have stag nights
sometimes. It's not like there's always
something going on."
Parties 'Every Other Weekend'
Although the Phi Delts have a party
"every other weekend," says Uribie,
"it's not like anyone is discouraged
from studying."
Part of initiation this year was a

community service project, according
to Uribie. The pledges fixed up a
house for the blind.
Krebs describes Stanford
fraternities in general as "not rah-rah
gung-ho like those in the South or
Southern California." Though many
people think of fraternity brothers as
jocks or frat-rats, Mueller insists that it
is unfair to stereotype. "People in
theme houses could probably be
stereotyped more than fraternities,
because they have the same interests.
You can call some frats rowdy, others
athletically or scholastically based, but
you can't call any one house a
jock-house."
Bands And Mountain Climbers
Stanford's diversity spreads to its
fraternities. Peter Sylvester of the
General Secretary's Office says that
the Alpha Delts were always well
known for their band, the Alpha Sigs
were mountain climbers, and the old
Alpha Kappa Lambdas had the highest
grade point average of all fraternities.
National fraternity organizations
have found Stanford chapters often go
their own way.
But the nationals have learned to
tolerate local autonomy, which is a
common practice across the nation,
according to Mueller of Sigma Chi. He
does, however, cite several advantages
of belonging to the national
organization: members can receive
scholarships and loans, executive
secretaries are available to help with
rush and committees, and local
chapters are encouraged to take part in
community affairs.
One great advantage, says Mueller,
is the common experience shared by
all members of a single fraternity.
The initiation rituals of a fraternity

are secret, and they are identical for
every chapter. "The officers really
take it seriously," states Uribie.
"Sigma Chi was founded on lofty
ideals," says Mueller.
Fraternity alumni get together with
their "brothers" often, and with the
undergraduate members once a year.
Most frat men admit that such lifelong
commitment to the organization is a
major reason for joining.
The pledge knows, claims Uribie,
that when he is initiated, he will be a
Phi Delt "for the rest of his life."
Mueller estimates that "99 percent of
those who are initiated are glad they
were."
Commitment
Gary DeSmet of Sigma Chi calls the
fraternity "a more real situation than a
dorm" because one makes a
commitment to the fraternity, helps
maintain the house, solves budget
problems, and helps with rush. "The
fraternity house reflects the people
who live there, and I'm proud of this
house," DeSmet said.
Fraternities were at the height of
unpopularity during the late '60s and
1970, which was the all-time low
pledge year for many. But they are on
the way back now.
Last year, the Phi Delts had a
pledge class of about 15, and few frats
had to recruit members. Uribie says,
"I've always considered fraternities a
part of college life." But the fraternity
of today has changed, even if only as a
product of changing times, as SAE's
Krebs suggests.
No Discrimination
Today's fraternity cannot
discriminate against prospective
pledges on the basis of race or religion
without causing an uproar among
other fraternities and all students.
Some frats have entered the draw,
such as Theta Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi.
A few houses currently in the draw
are still considered fraternities only
because they maintain alumni ties.
Lambda Nu (formerly Alpha Kappa
Lambda), a prime example, is coed
and in the draw; its members do not
consider the house a frat, but they still
meet with AKL alumni once a year.
Rush System
There are now only 12 all-male
fraternities which use the rush system
for member selection.
Mueller says no new fraternities are
allowed to build on campus and
conjectures that all the current ones
will remain.
"The University does not love us,
nor does it hate us," states Mueller.
"Fraternities are regarded as an

alternate living style, and so they are
tolerated." Sylvester says he hopes for
"a stronger, more diversified fraternity
system at Stanford."
In 'The Purpose and Meaning of
College Fraternities," Charles P.
Steinmetz wrote that "the fraternity,
based on the family idea, should be a
most powerful influence towards all
that is desirable in college life." Ernest
Lewis, a pioneer Phi Delt, called upon
fraternities to "assist in sowing those
seeds that shall grow and ripen into
perfected manhood."
Krebs modernizes the definition,
calling the fraternity "a living group of
people like yourself, with whom you
can get along." Perhaps this indicates
the current status of frats - the pranks
are still played, the members are still
proud, but the atmosphere seems more
open, more easy-going, and certainly
not as pompous as in the early years.

certain amount of anonymity in his
actions. The many fraternity pranks
over the years have ranged from
carrying off all the girls from Hurlburt
House, and driving a firetruck into the
lake bed, to forcibly shaving the head
of former ASSU president David
Harris.
Those are the incidents that make
the news and foster statements like:
"some of the biggest moral lepers 11 ]
ever knew were members of Stanford
fraternities." That was the opinion of
Bob Chandler, a Daily columnist who
urged abolition of fraternities in 1946.
But is this image accurate? What are
fraternities like in 1974?
Current Sigma Chi president John
Mueller doesn't like an image of
irresponsibility. "Frankly, I think
some of the best men on campus live
in fraternities," he said recently,
referring to scholastic and athletic
achievement and student leadership.
"You have to look at it in terms of
fun," remarks Phi Delt Frank Uribie.
Whether a fraternity is rowdy on
the weekends or not, frat life is not
always one continuous orgy of beer.
SAE president Ken Krebs says, "It's
kind of rare to get together and drink
beer, but we do have stag nights
sometimes. It's not like there's always
something going on."
Parties 'Every Other Weekend'
Although the Phi Delts have a party
"every other weekend," says Uribie,
"it's not like anyone is discouraged
from studying."
Part of initiation this year was a

community service project, according
to Uribie. The pledges fixed up a
house for the blind.
Krebs describes Stanford
fraternities in general as "not rah-rah
gung-ho like those in the South or
Southern California." Though many
people think of fraternity brothers as
jocks or frat-rats, Mueller insists that it
is unfair to stereotype. "People in
theme houses could probably be
stereotyped more than fraternities,
because they have the same interests.
You can call some frats rowdy, others
athletically or scholastically based, but
you can't call any one house a
jock-house."
Bands And Mountain Climbers
Stanford's diversity spreads to its
fraternities. Peter Sylvester of the
General Secretary's Office says that
the Alpha Delts were always well
known for their band, the Alpha Sigs
were mountain climbers, and the old
Alpha Kappa Lambdas had the highest
grade point average of all fraternities.
National fraternity organizations
have found Stanford chapters often go
their own way.
But the nationals have learned to
tolerate local autonomy, which is a
common practice across the nation,
according to Mueller of Sigma Chi. He
does, however, cite several advantages
of belonging to the national
organization: members can receive
scholarships and loans, executive
secretaries are available to help with
rush and committees, and local
chapters are encouraged to take part in
community affairs.
One great advantage, says Mueller,
is the common experience shared by
all members of a single fraternity.
The initiation rituals of a fraternity

are secret, and they are identical for
every chapter. "The officers really
take it seriously," states Uribie.
"Sigma Chi was founded on lofty
ideals," says Mueller.
Fraternity alumni get together with
their "brothers" often, and with the
undergraduate members once a year.
Most frat men admit that such lifelong
commitment to the organization is a
major reason for joining.
The pledge knows, claims Uribie,
that when he is initiated, he will be a
Phi Delt "for the rest of his life."
Mueller estimates that "99 percent of
those who are initiated are glad they
were."
Commitment
Gary DeSmet of Sigma Chi calls the
fraternity "a more real situation than a
dorm" because one makes a
commitment to the fraternity, helps
maintain the house, solves budget
problems, and helps with rush. "The
fraternity house reflects the people
who live there, and I'm proud of this
house," DeSmet said.
Fraternities were at the height of
unpopularity during the late '60s and
1970, which was the all-time low
pledge year for many. But they are on
the way back now.
Last year, the Phi Delts had a
pledge class of about 15, and few frats
had to recruit members. Uribie says,
"I've always considered fraternities a
part of college life." But the fraternity
of today has changed, even if only as a
product of changing times, as SAE's
Krebs suggests.
No Discrimination
Today's fraternity cannot
discriminate against prospective
pledges on the basis of race or religion
without causing an uproar among
other fraternities and all students.
Some frats have entered the draw,
such as Theta Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi.
A few houses currently in the draw
are still considered fraternities only
because they maintain alumni ties.
Lambda Nu (formerly Alpha Kappa
Lambda), a prime example, is coed
and in the draw; its members do not
consider the house a frat, but they still
meet with AKL alumni once a year.
Rush System
There are now only 12 all-male
fraternities which use the rush system
for member selection.
Mueller says no new fraternities are
allowed to build on campus and
conjectures that all the current ones
will remain.
"The University does not love us,
nor does it hate us," states Mueller.
"Fraternities are regarded as an

alternate living style, and so they are
tolerated." Sylvester says he hopes for
"a stronger, more diversified fraternity
system at Stanford."
In 'The Purpose and Meaning of
College Fraternities," Charles P.
Steinmetz wrote that "the fraternity,
based on the family idea, should be a
most powerful influence towards all
that is desirable in college life." Ernest
Lewis, a pioneer Phi Delt, called upon
fraternities to "assist in sowing those
seeds that shall grow and ripen into
perfected manhood."
Krebs modernizes the definition,
calling the fraternity "a living group of
people like yourself, with whom you
can get along." Perhaps this indicates
the current status of frats - the pranks
are still played, the members are still
proud, but the atmosphere seems more
open, more easy-going, and certainly
not as pompous as in the early years.
