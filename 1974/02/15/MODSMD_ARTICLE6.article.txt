# Admission Figures

Fred Horgodon I

This much can be said for
Doyle McManus's cheap shot in
the Daily of Feb. 13: he allows
that Mark Twain had a clearer
mind than most of us.
In fact, McManus's article
reminded me of what Mark Twain
once observed about science:
"There is something fascinating
about (it)... . One gets such
wholesale returns of conjecture
out of such a trifling investment
of fact."
From a few facts, all of them
previously made public, McManus
creates a number of false
impressions, which impressions
are drawn either maliciously
and/or out of ignorance. To
support these he even goes so far
as to cite again an irresponsible
quote which he used in an article
last fall, one which the source
later took some pains to correct
him on.
Realistic Data
First, the matter of numbers.
The figures which McManus cites
come directly from our office.
They are the figures I reported to
the Academic Senate last spring,
to the Academic Planning Office
for their reports, and to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions. There is nothing
secret about them. They
represent, I believe, the hardest
and most realistic data about
admissions obtainable at any
comparable institution of higher
education.
As far as I know, ours is one of
very few, if not the only one,
which by virtue of a two-step
process, clearly distinguishes
between an application (payment
of an application fee and the filing
of preliminary forms) and an
inquiry, which in most
institutions ranges from simply
requesting material to completing
and returning some, but not all, of
the application papers which are
sent out. We further distinguish
between "actionable" candidates
(those who not only apply but
who also complete all of the
application requirements) and
"non-actionable" candidates
(those who apply, but whose
applications reach various stages
of incompletion).
When we speak of having to
review over 9000 applications, we
mean just that. This is the number
who actually file preliminary
papers, submit an application fee,
have file folders and other records
set up in their names, receive
supplementary application papers,
are sent (after reviewing) either
incomplete or complete notices
(or, if substantially incomplete by
a given date, are "washed out" of
the process entirely and are so
notified). In other words, they are
labored over and treated as
applicants throughout the process,
in spite of the fact we know some
of them (but not ones, for
some time) will fail to complete
their applications. We do not, as
do many colleges, simply treat
incomplete applications as
"rejects."
How Office Works
The reasons for citing any
figures at all the other evening (as
I thought I went to great lengths
to make clear) was not for the
ludicrous purpose of impressing
those already here with how hard
it was for them to get in. Rather, I
took the occasion to explain what
it is that an admissions office does
throughout a calendar year other
than make selections, just how
many people other than the
professional staff are involved,
and just how crucial to the
process is the accurate handling,
filing and recording of thousands
and thousands of documents by
our clerical and secretarial staff.
How, in God's name, could
someone who is Associate Editor

of the Daily have so selectively
listened as to missthat point?
Why do we use the figure for
"applications filed" rather than
"applications completed?" First,
because it more accurately reflects
the actual labor expended in our
office. Second, because for
national surveys, it is the figure
most comparable to that used by
other institutions. On the other
hand, when talking with
prospective candidates or to
secondary school personnel, not
only do we stress the fact that
applicant-enrollee ratios are
misleading (and, as McManus fails
to understand, selectivity or
degree of difficulty of gaining
admission has as much to do with
the quality of applicants as with
the ratio of applicants to admits),
but we also point out that among
our applicants there are a
significant number who are far
from highly qualified.
If one ignores the relative
quality of applicants, the
percentage figure of those
admitted is just as misleading as it
is used by McManus (to imply less
difficulty) as when it is used in
the manner he quite rightly
deplores (to imply more
difficulty). In terms of academic
quality, some institutions with
high ratios of applicants to admits
may in fact be far less selective
than some with much lower ratios
of applicants to admits.
Mumbo Jumbo
As for the number offered
admission as contrasted with the
number enrolled, what else is
new? These are not "new"
numbers, discovered by McManus.
They are ones I (and all of us in
admissions) use all of the time in
our literature, in our talks, in
articles. But even that figure is
misleading. It would be possible
to admit far fewer than we do to
enroll the freshman class were we
to adopt the practics of other
colleges (e.g., early decision
programs, the "A" rating of
candidates in the independent
schools, requesting applicants to
indicate their "first choice," and
so forth). My impression is that all
of these figures mean far less to
me than they do to McManus. In
fact, he seems aware of only a
fraction of their ambiguities,
thereby substituting his own
"mumbo jumbo" for that which
he claims to have uncovered.
Lastly, it seems incredible that
anyone could have sat through my
talk last week and come away
with the impression that I was
breaking my arm to pat on the
back either Stanford, Stanford
students, or myself. The topic,
"The Chosen Few" was not of my
doing and its implications are as
distasteful to me (although for
some quite different reasons, I
would wager) as they apparently
are to McManus. While I realize I
am not the most articulate soul
around this place, I nevertheless
cannot remember an occasion
(including last week) on which I
have either spoken or written
about Stanford admissions and
not remarked that all of us would
do well to adopt a more humble
perspective about the University,
its students, and the admissions
process. In fact, it is the level of
quality represented by articles
such as McManus's which led me
to make the substantive (but
unreported) remarks about the
less attractive features of Stanford
that I did at last week's meeting.
I do not know with which
socioeconomic class McManus is
most comfortable in identifying
himself; I do know one need not
look further than his article for a
good example of what, in its
worst sense, being "clever" means.

Admissions.)
