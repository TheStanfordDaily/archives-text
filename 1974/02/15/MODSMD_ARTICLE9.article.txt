# A 						Centralized RA Union?
## 
### 
Mike O'Connor

Last Thursday, the Daily ran
an article on labor organization
among research assistants (RA's)
and teaching assistants (TA's). It
seems necessary to alert the 990
RA's and 644 TA's of the
University to the significance of
the mid-March National Labor
Relations Board hearing
mentioned in the article.
First some background.
Briefly, when a union petitions
for an election, the NLRB must
first determine if the unit of
employees petitioned for is
appropriate. In some cases, such
as this one, the determination is
made subsequent to a formal
hearing at which the objections of
the employer are heard.
The petition in question is by
the Stanford Union of Research
Physicists for a unit consisting for
the most part of themselves —
namely the RA's of the Dept. of
Physics. The position of the
employer, the University, was

revealed at a pre-hearing
conference held on Jan. 31. Mr.
Douglas Barton, labor lawyer for
the Provost's Office, sought
dismissal of the Union's petition.
He indicated that the
University's position at the
hearing would be that RA's are
not employees. Barring success
there, Barton announced that he
intended to pursue a lengthy
presentation of some weeks
duration which would show that a
bargaining unit consisting of all
RA's and TA's in all departments
of the University is the
appropriate one (though TA's
were also not deemed to be
employees.)
RA's: Employees?
Why, you may ask, would
Barton go on to campaign for a
campus-wide unit if the Provost's
office doesn't think RA's or TA's
are employees? The answer is that
he has a very weak case to support
his first contention — that RA's

are not employees. The
University's own "Guide to
Administrative Procedure" defines
graduate student RA's as
employees.
Secondly, the usual fees of
lawyers specializing in labor law
range from $500 to $1000 per
hearing day. The union's treasury
contains about $100. Thus if
Barton's litigiousness results in a
dictum that a campus-wide
bargaining unit is appropriate, the
union's petition would still be
dismissed. Who knows, with RA's
acting as attorneys on their own
behalf, Barton may even triumph
on the employee status issue.
There you have it — an
extraordinary performance by the
Provost's Office. Ordinarily the
faculty of Stanford University
would participate in the making
of policy affecting their RA's and
TA's. Universities generally
espouse the higher ideals of
integrity and accountability over
opportunism and expediency.
Non-employers don't usually
behave this way when dealing
with non-employees.
Right To Organize Denied
Barton's first contention, that
RA's and TA's are not employees,
would deny them the right to
organize under the protection of
the National Labor Relations Act
and to be represented by their
union in mandatory collective
bargaining.

His second contention is
particularly interesting. Though it
is clearly not his desire, a win here
would presumably establish a
campus-wide bargaining unit.
Thus in future years the
University may find itself
negotiating a contract with a
union representing all RA's and
TA's. Such a contract would
precisely fix all the working
conditions, stipends, and
conditions of employment of all
RA's and all TA's in all
departments of the University.
A labor lawyer's strategy of the
moment will have become a
lasting policy of the University —
the Provost's office, not the
several academic departments, will
control the conditions of
employment of RA's and TA's.
All in all, it promises to be a
very enlightening event. To the
Food Research Institute RA and
the TA in English: Barton, sincere
in his belief in the "continuity of
knowledge," will unite you. Law
School students who TA in
Politial Science can discover their
common community of interest
with Physics RA's. Department
chairmen can come see the new
policy of central control in acfeipn.
An extraordinary performance
indeed!

of the University is the
appropriate one (though TA's
were also not deemed to be
employees.)
RA's: Employees?
Why, you may ask, would
Barton go on to campaign for a
campus-wide unit if the Provost's
office doesn't think RA's or TA's
are employees? The answer is that
he has a very weak case to support
his first contention — that RA's

are not employees. The
University's own "Guide to
Administrative Procedure" defines
graduate student RA's as
employees.
Secondly, the usual fees of
lawyers specializing in labor law
range from $500 to $1000 per
hearing day. The union's treasury
contains about $100. Thus if
Barton's litigiousness results in a
dictum that a campus-wide
bargaining unit is appropriate, the
union's petition would still be
dismissed. Who knows, with RA's
acting as attorneys on their own
behalf, Barton may even triumph
on the employee status issue.
There you have it — an
extraordinary performance by the
Provost's Office. Ordinarily the
faculty of Stanford University
would participate in the making
of policy affecting their RA's and
TA's. Universities generally
espouse the higher ideals of
integrity and accountability over
opportunism and expediency.
Non-employers don't usually
behave this way when dealing
with non-employees.
Right To Organize Denied
Barton's first contention, that
RA's and TA's are not employees,
would deny them the right to
organize under the protection of
the National Labor Relations Act
and to be represented by their
union in mandatory collective
bargaining.

His second contention is
particularly interesting. Though it
is clearly not his desire, a win here
would presumably establish a
campus-wide bargaining unit.
Thus in future years the
University may find itself
negotiating a contract with a
union representing all RA's and
TA's. Such a contract would
precisely fix all the working
conditions, stipends, and
conditions of employment of all
RA's and all TA's in all
departments of the University.
A labor lawyer's strategy of the
moment will have become a
lasting policy of the University —
the Provost's office, not the
several academic departments, will
control the conditions of
employment of RA's and TA's.
All in all, it promises to be a
very enlightening event. To the
Food Research Institute RA and
the TA in English: Barton, sincere
in his belief in the "continuity of
knowledge," will unite you. Law
School students who TA in
Politial Science can discover their
common community of interest
with Physics RA's. Department
chairmen can come see the new
policy of central control in acfeipn.
An extraordinary performance
indeed!

Last Thursday, the Daily ran
an article on labor organization
among research assistants (RA's)
and teaching assistants (TA's). It
seems necessary to alert the 990
RA's and 644 TA's of the
University to the significance of
the mid-March National Labor
Relations Board hearing
mentioned in the article.
First some background.
Briefly, when a union petitions
for an election, the NLRB must
first determine if the unit of
employees petitioned for is
appropriate. In some cases, such
as this one, the determination is
made subsequent to a formal
hearing at which the objections of
the employer are heard.
The petition in question is by
the Stanford Union of Research
Physicists for a unit consisting for
the most part of themselves —
namely the RA's of the Dept. of
Physics. The position of the
employer, the University, was

revealed at a pre-hearing
conference held on Jan. 31. Mr.
Douglas Barton, labor lawyer for
the Provost's Office, sought
dismissal of the Union's petition.
He indicated that the
University's position at the
hearing would be that RA's are
not employees. Barring success
there, Barton announced that he
intended to pursue a lengthy
presentation of some weeks
duration which would show that a
bargaining unit consisting of all
RA's and TA's in all departments
of the University is the
appropriate one (though TA's
were also not deemed to be
employees.)

Right To Organize Denied
Barton's first contention, that
RA's and TA's are not employees,
would deny them the right to
organize under the protection of
the National Labor Relations Act
and to be represented by their
union in mandatory collective
bargaining.

His second contention is
particularly interesting. Though it
is clearly not his desire, a win here
would presumably establish a
campus-wide bargaining unit.
Thus in future years the
University may find itself
negotiating a contract with a
union representing all RA's and
TA's. Such a contract would
precisely fix all the working
conditions, stipends, and
conditions of employment of all
RA's and all TA's in all
departments of the University.
A labor lawyer's strategy of the
moment will have become a
lasting policy of the University —
the Provost's office, not the
several academic departments, will
control the conditions of
employment of RA's and TA's.
All in all, it promises to be a
very enlightening event. To the
Food Research Institute RA and
the TA in English: Barton, sincere
in his belief in the "continuity of
knowledge," will unite you. Law
School students who TA in
Politial Science can discover their
common community of interest
with Physics RA's. Department
chairmen can come see the new
policy of central control in acfeipn.
An extraordinary performance
indeed!

Physics Department and an officer

Research Assistants.)
