# Hearst's 'First Step': $2 Million For Poor
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Newspaper magnate Randolph A.
Hearst pledged $2 million yesterday to
feed the needy as a first step in
winning freedom for his kidnaped
daughter Patricia.
"This is a gesture of good will,"
Hearst told a news conference at a
downtown hotel. "There is no
guarantee Patricia is going to get home
on this."
Hearst said he was donating
$500,000 himself and that the Hearst
Foundation was giving $1.5 million.
He said arrangements have been made
for the money "to be delivered to a
tax-exempt, charitable organization
approved by the attorney general of
California, capable of making a
distribution for the benefit of the poor
and needy."
Hearst said he was still looking for a
suitable organization to administer the
food giveaway demanded by the
terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army
which claims it kidnaped Miss Hearst
on Feb. 4.

The money will be available today,
"but we have to find the proper
conduit," the gray-haired president
and editor of the San Francisco
Examiner said.
Hearst said the $500,000 he is
giving is "a substantial part of my
personal assets." He said the remaining
$1.5 million from the William
Randolph Hearst Foundation had been
approved by directors of the charitable
organization after family members
disqualified themselves.
"This is an honest effort on my part
to do what I can, and that's all I can
do. I think they'll believe that," he
said.
The SLA had given Hearst until
today to devise a sweeping food
giveaway estimated to cost as much as
$400 million. Hearst said he only
could afford a modified plan for the

poorest of the poor.
Hearst also said he asked noted San
Francisco lawyer William Coblentz to
see that two SLA members charged
with the murder of Oakland Schools
Supt. Marcus Foster last Nov. 6 get a
fair trial.
Hearst made it clear he did not
think the food giveaway would be the
last demand attached to his daughter's
eventual release, and the kidnapers
said as much in one recent
communication.
They said then that if Hearst met
the food demand they would be able
to negotiate the release of his
daughter, presumably meaning there
would be further conditions. Implicit
in the first tape Hearst received from
his daughter was that the release of the
two SLA members would be tied to
her release.
Distribution Mechanics
Hearst said the mechanics of how
the money would be spent and the
food distributed remained to be
worked out. He met with reporters
after a five-hour conference with
leaders of activist groups designated by
the SLA to monitor the food plan.
Hearst said he had consulted with
the California attorney general's office
because its approval is necessary
before a charitable foundation can be
established in the state. He said the
attorney general's office also would be
consulted on the mechanics of the
food distribution plan.
Earlier yesterday, FBI agent John
Kelly said the FBI still was looking
into the possibility that persons who
accept the food could be violating the
law by taking part in extortion
activities.
Of the possibility of extortion
charges, Kelly said: "I haven't
researched it, but this aspect has been
in it and we are looking at it." He had
no other comment about Hearst's
plan.

last demand attached to his daughter's
eventual release, and the kidnapers
said as much in one recent
communication.
They said then that if Hearst met
the food demand they would be able
to negotiate the release of his
daughter, presumably meaning there
would be further conditions. Implicit
in the first tape Hearst received from
his daughter was that the release of the
two SLA members would be tied to
her release.
Distribution Mechanics
Hearst said the mechanics of how
the money would be spent and the
food distributed remained to be
worked out. He met with reporters
after a five-hour conference with
leaders of activist groups designated by
the SLA to monitor the food plan.
Hearst said he had consulted with
the California attorney general's office
because its approval is necessary
before a charitable foundation can be
established in the state. He said the
attorney general's office also would be
consulted on the mechanics of the
food distribution plan.
Earlier yesterday, FBI agent John
Kelly said the FBI still was looking
into the possibility that persons who
accept the food could be violating the
law by taking part in extortion
activities.
Of the possibility of extortion
charges, Kelly said: "I haven't
researched it, but this aspect has been
in it and we are looking at it." He had
no other comment about Hearst's
plan.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Newspaper magnate Randolph A.
Hearst pledged $2 million yesterday to
feed the needy as a first step in
winning freedom for his kidnaped
daughter Patricia.
"This is a gesture of good will,"
Hearst told a news conference at a
downtown hotel. "There is no
guarantee Patricia is going to get home
on this."
Hearst said he was donating
$500,000 himself and that the Hearst
Foundation was giving $1.5 million.
He said arrangements have been made
for the money "to be delivered to a
tax-exempt, charitable organization
approved by the attorney general of
California, capable of making a
distribution for the benefit of the poor
and needy."
Hearst said he was still looking for a
suitable organization to administer the
food giveaway demanded by the
terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army
which claims it kidnaped Miss Hearst
on Feb. 4.

The money will be available today,
"but we have to find the proper
conduit," the gray-haired president
and editor of the San Francisco
Examiner said.
Hearst said the $500,000 he is
giving is "a substantial part of my
personal assets." He said the remaining
$1.5 million from the William
Randolph Hearst Foundation had been
approved by directors of the charitable
organization after family members
disqualified themselves.
"This is an honest effort on my part
to do what I can, and that's all I can
do. I think they'll believe that," he
said.
The SLA had given Hearst until
today to devise a sweeping food
giveaway estimated to cost as much as
$400 million. Hearst said he only
could afford a modified plan for the

poorest of the poor.
Hearst also said he asked noted San
Francisco lawyer William Coblentz to
see that two SLA members charged
with the murder of Oakland Schools
Supt. Marcus Foster last Nov. 6 get a
fair trial.
Hearst made it clear he did not
think the food giveaway would be the
last demand attached to his daughter's
eventual release, and the kidnapers
said as much in one recent
communication.
