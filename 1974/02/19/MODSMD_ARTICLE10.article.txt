# SLA And Greenlee's Novel
##

Charles Ogletree I

I am one who was somewhat
annoyed by the innuendoes and
inferences that were expressed in
the article entitled "Could Book
Be SLA Influence?" by Bill
Evers, which appeared in the
Daily Feb. 14.
The article points out in several
ways how a product of Stanford
assumes that he has the
intellectual capacity to diagnose
the "coming of the revolution."
Several underlying assertions were
either ignored or overlooked by
Evers.
Rather than discuss the
negative acts of the SLA, I
would like to present the positive
intentions. One important fact
that was pointed out by their
actions is the question of the
unequal distribution of wealth in
the U.S. Their intention was to
provide goods and services to the
economically deprived.
Many who lack access to
resources such as the media
(radio, TV, etc.) will be
completely unaware of the source
of their "gifts" or perhaps will
receive a distorted view of the
actual events. Conversely, the

breakfast program of the Black
Panther Party (remember them â€”
they are those "gun wielding
black militants in Oakland") was
accepted by the people, although
many did not align themselves
with the Black Panther Party on
an ideological level.
In addition, Evers cites that
prominent radicals are convinced
that the novel The Spook Who Sat
by the Door by Sam Greenlee, has
influencced the thinking of the
SLA. I'm sure that if the SLA
or any other group for that matter
wanted to "make a revolution"
they would have to go far beyond
"the master plan" that is outlined
in Greenlee's novel. What Evers
has actually done through the
distortions and inferences in his
analysis is to portray black people
as the enemie&Mif the people. The
author of the novel is black, two
of the suspects are reported to be
black, the voice on the tape is
supposedly that of a black; so in
essence the counter-productive
actions that have occurred portray
black people as the enemies of the
people, another contradiction in
terms.

What Evers failed to point out
about the novel is the fact that
the government officials were
convinced that such a masterful
act as that pulled off by the
Cobras couldn't possibly be the
result of a black man's planning
and wisdom, so the government
assumed that the actions were a
plot by the Russians. How far will
Mr. Evers' assumptions be carried?
Will the mass media also correlate
the brainchild of Sam Greenlee
with the actions of the SLA in
an effort to hoodwink the people?
It's quite clear that once again
the members of the intellectual
community have completely
misunderstood the message
transmitted through Greenlee's
work. Furthermore, I sincerely
hope that Mr. Evers was not
convinced of the credibility of his
argument, but perhaps had
nothing better to do with his
time. If the effort was to present
an interesting analysis of a current
event, I would suggest that those
energies be spent analyzing the
reaction of the U.S. House of
Representatives to the pleas of the
drought-stricken nations of

Africa.
The death of Marcus Foster,
whoever the assassin(s) might be, is
an act contrary to the interests of
the people. But the actions of the
media in distorting issues and
implicitly correlating the efforts
of the SLA with the intentions
of the author of Tho Spook Who
Sat by the Door (whose intentions
were to educate the people), serve
only to deceive and mislead the
people. Only greater confusion
and uncertainty will result.
Finally, I would suggest that
Mr. Evers consult Gil Scott Heron
or the Last Poets, who are the
street authorities on the subject,
before attempting to do an
analysis of the coming revolution.
The street authorities clearly state
that you won't hear it on TV or
radio, you won't be able to read
about it at your local newsstand,
but instead, that the revolution
will be LI VE. I suggest that the
first step should be to reread the
novel. Hopefully he'll learn a great
deal from it.
