# Wascher: Where Were You?

Sally Harris I

While I agree that Jim
Wascher's article entitled, 'Friend:
Too Little, Too Late' (Daily, Feb.
12) was an accurate recording of
ASSU Vice President Jim Friend's
attendance at committee
meetings, I disagree with his
assumption that Friend was the
only student involved in fighting
the construction of theemeritus
housing complex on the Row and
therefore subject to take all the
blame which Wascher repeatedly
provided and accept the burn for
being too late.
True, Friend was invited to all
the meetings mentioned in the
article, only because he is ASSU
vice president. The University
neglected to invite those students
who, when they finally found out
about the emeritus housing
complex plans, were organizing
their efforts to stop the building
of the complex on the Row and
would most certainly have voiced
disapproval. Why didn't the
University let them know of these
"opportunities to express'
dissatisfaction?"
I am a resident of the Row
(Grove House) and I knew
nothing about the emeritus
housing complex until a
personally researched article by
Doug Sterne appeared in the
Daily, describing the plans. No
one in our house had been
approached about any meetings
whereby we could express our
dissatisfaction with the housing
complex.
It was stated that Friend,
.. at the June and October
meetings of the Trustee's
Committee on Land and Buildings
raised no objections when the
complex was discussed." I can
personally see how Friend could
easily have raised no objections
when the complex was discussed,
after attending a meeting in
January with Oscar Nelson,
University master planner, who
convinced those attending that
nothing could be done at that
point and who quite easily could
have convinced three student
representatives (like the three on

the Trustees' Land and Buildings
Committee) that the complex and
site were wonderful, with his
inflexible persuasiveness.
Student Opinion Nothing
A student on a Trustees'
committee, or any committee,
with no voting power, means
nothing. Because we are
"transients," our opinions, as well
as ourselves, lack permanence.
Our views have been regarded as
inexperienced in the past, and
therefore have been passed over
and ignored. The University must
stop games like giving students a
"voice" on a committee and only
pretending to pay attention to
what they have to say or
inhibiting any student input at all
in committee discussions by
resorting to authoritarian
gimmicks. How heavily has a
student's opinion ever been
weighed compared to a University
official?
Wascher's question, "Why
bother when students don't even
take advantage of the input which
they already possess?" was very
wrong in what he based his
conclusion on one student's initial
disconcern. Friend did perhaps
jump on the bandwagon late, but
as one of the many people who
opposed the building of the
emeritus housing complex from
the beginning and worked to try
and change the site location, I
would tend to condone his
mistake, as he later made a
considerable effort in aiding the
cause, regardless of his personal
reasons.
Students Respond
Wascher also said, "Until
Friend and others begin to take
advantage of these opportunities,
Augsburger was correct when he
wrote to Friend that the
Administration cannot be held
responsible if students choose not
to involve themselves or to
respond." I am one of the others,
and I am taking advantage of
those opportunities to express my
dissatisfaction concerning the
housing complex on the Row, as
did 2400 other students in the

referendum election.
At an open Senate meeting
attended by Augsburger, many
students availed themselves of the
opportunity to respond and
involve themselves once they had
been told of the proposed plans at
a time and place where they knew
they would be listened to. Doing
so they raised enough
unanswerable questions to cause
the University to review the
project.
'Daily' Failed
The Stanford Daily, as well as
the ASSU Council of Presidents,
represents the viewpoint of the

student body. It is the
responsibility of the Daily to
report as much as they can
concerning the students and the
University. Can you tell me where
in the Daily they printed the
dates, times and places of the
committee meetings concerning
the emeritus housing complex? I
would have become concerned a
lot sooner if the University
officials had announced their
meetings and the Daily had
printed them.
