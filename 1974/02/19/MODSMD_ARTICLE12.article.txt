# China's Progress

Liu Shao-yuan I

Professor Chao Chi-Chang's
favorable impressions of
present-day conditions on the
Chinese mainland, as reported in
the Feb. 14 Daily, reiterates the
views of many recent visitors
there, namely that everything's a
lot better now than in the "bad
old days" 25-30 years ago.
Before we rush to any
judgment, however — before we
congratulate the Chinese or praise
their government — we would do
well to keep two points in mind.
First, 30 years ago China was
engaged in a major war against
Japan, a titanic struggle for her
national survival that in the course
of eight years (more than twice
the tenure of America's
involvement in World War II) took
a fearful toll of her people and
reduced her polity and economy
to shambles, and portions of her
major cities to rubble. Then in
1947, when she was already
prostrate from the exhaustion of
the war, she was further convulsed
by a renewal of the city war
between the Nationalists and
Communists which, at its
conclusion in 1949, left China in
the weakest state in her long
history.

A second point to bear in mind
is that 25-30 years, a quarter of a
century, is a pretty long period of
time, during which perhaps the
only people who might not be
touched, however lightly, by the
benevolent hand of progress
would be the Australian
aborigines.
Let us also, however, keep our
sense of historical perspective.
Saying that China today is in
better physical condition than 25
years ago is a simple observation
of fact, but no less obvious than
the statement that Berlin looks
considerably better today than it
did on V-E Day.
Those of us who cannot resist
marveling at the icons of
contemporary China (like indoor
plumbing and street cars that run
on time) might ask two questions.
First, was China 40 years ago —
before the disruption of war —
really as bad as the Communists
say it was? And second, where
would China be today if it had
not had to suffer the reverses of
the Cultural Revolution, the Great
Leap Forward, and the Hundred
Flowers campaign?

better physical condition than 25
years ago is a simple observation
of fact, but no less obvious than
the statement that Berlin looks
considerably better today than it
did on V-E Day.
Those of us who cannot resist
marveling at the icons of
contemporary China (like indoor
plumbing and street cars that run
on time) might ask two questions.
First, was China 40 years ago —
before the disruption of war —
really as bad as the Communists
say it was? And second, where
would China be today if it had
not had to suffer the reverses of
the Cultural Revolution, the Great
Leap Forward, and the Hundred
Flowers campaign?

favorable impressions of
present-day conditions on the
Chinese mainland, as reported in
the Feb. 14 Daily, reiterates the
views of many recent visitors
there, namely that everything's a
lot better now than in the "bad
old days" 25-30 years ago.
Before we rush to any
judgment, however — before we
congratulate the Chinese or praise
their government — we would do
well to keep two points in mind.
First, 30 years ago China was
engaged in a major war against
Japan, a titanic struggle for her
national survival that in the course
of eight years (more than twice
the tenure of America's
involvement in World War II) took
a fearful toll of her people and
reduced her polity and economy
to shambles, and portions of her
major cities to rubble. Then in
1947, when she was already
prostrate from the exhaustion of
the war, she was further convulsed
by a renewal of the city war
between the Nationalists and
Communists which, at its
conclusion in 1949, left China in
the weakest state in her long
history.

A second point to bear in mind
is that 25-30 years, a quarter of a
century, is a pretty long period of
time, during which perhaps the
only people who might not be
touched, however lightly, by the
benevolent hand of progress
would be the Australian
aborigines.
Let us also, however, keep our
sense of historical perspective.
Saying that China today is in
better physical condition than 25
years ago is a simple observation
of fact, but no less obvious than
the statement that Berlin looks
considerably better today than it
did on V-E Day.
