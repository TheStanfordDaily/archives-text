# No Ted In 1976
## 
### 
In an article tucked away'
inside Saturday's New York
Times, R.W.- Apple Jr. reported
that "Senator Edward M.
Kennedy is saying privately, to his
closest political associates, that it
is extremely unlikely that he will
run for president in 1976."
Aside from the impeachment
of Richard Nixon, no other
political news should be more
welcome than Kennedy's reported
reluctance to run. Kennedy, a
man beset by a long series of
personal and family crises, simply
never has demonstrated his
capacity to be president.
The flock of Kennedy cultists
who yearn for a return to the
Camelot days of the early 60s do
themselves and the Democratic
Party a great disservice by
assuming that having any
Kennedy in the White House will
solve the problems of the party
and the nation.
Rather than looking no further
than his last name, Edward
Kennedy's supporters should
examine his record. If they did,
they would find little that would
attract voters to him as a
presidential candidate — and a
great deal that should repel them.
Rarely has Kennedy
demonstrated the integrity and
good judgment which have been
noticeably lacking in our more
recent presidents. More often than
not, Kennedy has relied upon his
family's name and wealth to
extricate him from sticky
situations.
Expelled from Harvard after he
persuaded a friend to take an
examination for him, Kennedy
enlisted in the Army. Soon,
however, he decided that he had
made another mistake and his
father had to intervene to reduce
his tour of duty from three to two
years.
Kennedy then bought his way
back into Harvard, graduated and
went on to law school. Only a few
years after obtaining his law
degree, Kennedy parlayed his
name into a U.S. Senate seat —
defeating men with far more
experience in government.
As a senator, Kennedy did
little to distinguish himself. Even
so, in 1969 he defeated Russell B.
Long of Louisiana for Senate
Majority Whip, not because of any
proven leadership ability, but
because of his name. Long
summarized the situation aptly:
"I had Senator Kennedy
outgunned in the United States
Senate, he had me outgunned in
the United States."
Kennedy's conduct in the
Chappaquiddick case was
irresponsible, if not criminal.
What is so astounding about the
whole incident is that Kennedy
remained so uncontrite about his
reckless actions leading to the
death of Mary Jo Kopechne and
the inexcusably long time he
waited to report the accident.
Taken as a single incident,
Chappaquiddick should not
prevent Edward Kennedy from
becoming president. Taken as but
one in a series of irresponsible
actions, it must be viewed in an
entirely different light.
Especially a 112 t e r
Chappaquiddick, Kennedy's
record as whip was so dismal that,
in 1971, his colleagues rejected his
bid for reelection. Since then,
Kennedy has concentrated on
little except his treasured national
health insurance plan. Despite
hefty Democratic majorities in
both houses of Congress, Kennedy
has met with almost no success in
leading his plan to adoption.
Given numerous opportunities
to prove himself as both a
potential leader and a man of
decency, Edward Kennedy has
failed numerous times. His
qualifications to be president are
indeed dubious at best.
Nevertheless, Kennedy's
adherents would have us ignore
his undistinguished record simply
because they believe he could win
in 1976. Let us not forget that
Republicans made the same
argument in behalf of Richard
Nixon as the Watergate scandal
brewed in 1972. The United
States has suffered long enough
because of this "victory at any
price" attitude.
In Edward Kennedy his
followers see the symbol of a
bygone era, of a president who
was robbed of his chance to
govern. But the country needs a
leader, not a symbol, and
Kennedy has never proven that he
has the ability to lead.
The case against Edward
Kennedy could go on and on. The
times call for a man of uncommon
decency and good judgment. It is
clear that Edward Kennedy is not
that man. Hopefully, Kennedy's
reported withdrawal from the
1976 presidential race will
encourage that man — whoever he
is — to step forward.
