# Psychologist Defines Memory Process
## 
### CECILE HEROLD 
A kindergartner once offered
University psychologist Dr.
Gordon Bower his personal
definition of memory: "It's what
I forget with." In his speech last
Thursday night at Skilling
Auditorium, Bower redefined this
mind process as "a combination
of sensory information and
cognitive knowledge essential for
adaption to environment."
Four Tasks
Bower described memory as a
"process" because it involves four
distinct tasks:
— The first, registration, occurs
when the message of some
stimulus is received and accepted
by the brain.
— The second task, trace
formation, involves the
identification of the new stimulus
with some former stimulus.

— Trace retention, the third
task, describes the brain's ability
to retain this newly-stored
information.
— Lastly, trace-retrieval is what
we depend upon in the heat of
final exams — the pulling forth of
the information from its slot,
accurately recalling it and actively
putting it to use.
Two Forms
Bower explained that memory
comes in two forms — long-term
and short-term — and added that
long-term memory retains
endurably all information which
the learner has identified and
associated with former
knowledge. It is "patterned
information" which has meaning
for the learner, Bower said.
The short-term memory holds,
obviously for a brief time, what

Bower called "nonsense
information" such as historical
dates and license plate numbers to
which the learner has attached no
special significance. This
"nonsense information" is often
incorporated into the memory via
rote rehearsal, which Bower
typified as one of the oldest
memory strategies and one most
susceptible to memory erase.
"Sight to sound coding," he
continued, "results simply in
confusion and substitution. The
brain can house five to seven
chunks of new material at one
time. If, instead of using simple
repetition, the learner rewrites
one of these chunks into things he
already knowns, the chunk is
more readily retained and the
brain can take on a new chunk of
material."

Illustrating this technique of
"identifying" a chunk, Bower
said, "Suppose I am the victim of
a hit-and-run driver who catches
sight of my assailant's license. I
can repeat the number to myself
until I pass out or I can notice
something about the plate —
perhaps the first three letters are
my initials and the last three
numbers are my house number.
Through some type of association,
I won't forget the license."
Intelligence
Bower believes that memory is
related to intelligence for when an
I.Q. test includes portions
involving memory work, it is
measuring the student's ability to
put information into sequences.
In regard to the photographic,
or eidetic, memory, Bower
explained that its operation is not
fully understood by psychologists.
"Despite the fact that such great
advancements are occuring on the
microscopic, atomic, and cosmic
scale," Bower said, "we still know
relatively little about the
processes taking place in our own
heads."
