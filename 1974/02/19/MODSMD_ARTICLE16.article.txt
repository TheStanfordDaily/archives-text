# Stanford TV Transmits Education
## 
### JOE RAMEK 
A group of employees at a
Redwood City electronics plant is
seated watching television on
company time, but one can tell by
the pencils and notebooks in their
hands that this is no goldbricking
session. On the television screen a
Stanford professor calls his class
to order and begins to take roll.
"Hello, Ampex, are you
there?" One of the employees
responds by pressing a button and
then speaking into a microphone.
"How about you, IBM?" The roll
call continues with responses
coming in from around the Bay,
from points as far north as
Richmond and as far east as
Livermore. The Stanford
Instructional Television Network
is on the air.
Every week the Stanford
network transmits 160 hours of
live instruction to graduate and

non-degree-seeking students
working in industry. At 87
receiving classrooms located at 28
different firms throughout the
Bay Area the network's industrial
affiliates are proving that a
Stanford education does not have
to be limited to the Farm.
Enthusiastic
The firms subscribing to the
network's courses are enthusiastic
about the system. T.E. Lyons,
manager of education and training
for Lockheed Missile and Space in
Sunnyvale sees the significance of
the program for his firm as being
"improved morale [of the
employees taking the courses].
"A very large number of men
are willing to enroll in courses
which can do nothing but help
them personally and enhance their
value to the company."
Lyons adds that "the original
concerns about student-instructor
relationships, individual help,
homework and test
administration, the need to clarify
points during a lecture, equipment
failures at crucial times — these
problems just have never really
materialized."
The student-employees taking
the courses seem equally
enthusiastic. "I can come over
here," says an employee of a
Peninsula firm, "take a course, get
back to the job, work two hours
and hurry back for another
course. I'd lose a good half day if
I had to go to campus."
The network has also been well
received by the course instructors.
Those participating have had no
problem adjusting to the
television setup, and many have
asked to be scheduled again for
following quarters.
200 Courses
Last year over 200 courses,
some for credit and others not,
were provided by the network,
and more than 4000 persons to
industry took advantage of the
programming. All ten Stanford
engineering departments as well as
the departments of statistics,
computer science, applied physics
and chemistry have offered
courses.
In addition to this

engineering-oriented fare, the
system also broadcasts a complete
package of courses leading to a
Master of Business Administration
degree awarded by Golden Gate
University in San Francisco and a
variety of general interest courses.
The network utilizes four
channels in the microwave band
to carry its programming; thus
Stanford has the capacity to
broadcast four different classes
simultaneously. The four channels
used are among 31 that the FCC
made available in 1963 for
educational purposes. The high
frequency of the signal makes the
system essentially closed-circuit.
Special Rooms
The classes are telecast from
specially designed classrooms in
the Skilling Building on the
Stanford campus. There are two
cameras in each classroom; one is
at the back of the room, and the
other is suspended over the
instructor's desk.
The desk camera is usually
focused on a pad of paper, which
the teacher can use instead of the
blackboard; students actually in
the campus classroom must
therefore also be provided with
television monitors. The rear
camera's wide view of the class
and instructor and its zoom-ins on
speakers gives students at remote
locations the feeling of actually
being in class.
The network's audio system is
also designed to provide the
remote students with a feeling of
closeness. The remarks of
on-campus students are piped-out
along the network, and students
at the company classrooms can
communicate back with the
instructor and other students via a
specially licensed FM radio
hookup. The industry-based
students can thus "talk back" to
their television sets.
Paper-pushing
Paper-pushing between the
viewing students and the
instructor is handled by a
Stanford courier, who is
responsible for transporting class
handouts, homework, and exams,
which are administered at the

company sites under Honor Code
conditions.
The establishment of the
television system in 1967 was a
continuation of a twenty-year
tradition of cooperation between
Stanford and Bay Area companies
in providing members of industry
with access to University
educational resources.
Since 1953 over 1000 Master
of Science degrees have been
earned by working engineers
participating in the Stanford
Honors Cooperative Program
(HCP); that program enables
persons in industry who meet
normal departmental admission
requirements to attend regular
daytime classes at Stanford.
The director of the network,
Kenneth S. Down, recalls that the
HCP before the use of telecast
courses was "inefficient in terms
of time and energy lost in travel
to and from the campus." Down
also points out that "due to
classroom and parking space
limitations, only degree-seeking
Cost
Firms that affiliate with the
network are required to
contribute a share, pro-rated on
the basis of the company's gross
sales, of the $625,000
construction and continuing
development costs of the system.
They must also pay the cost of
equipping the receiving classrooms
on their grounds.
Despite these costs, many firms
find that they actually save
money by eliminating the
employee commute time involved
in taking classes on the Stanford
campus.
Ambitious Plans
The Stanford Instructional
Television Network has ambitious
plans for the future. It is presently
experimenting with the use of
videotape and has recently leased
a series of taped engineering
classes to a firm in Japan. The
network is also investigating the
feasibility of using satellite
broadcasting in cooperation with
other television organizations to
provide instruction to persons in
industry around the world.

value to the company."
Lyons adds that "the original
concerns about student-instructor
relationships, individual help,
homework and test
administration, the need to clarify
points during a lecture, equipment
failures at crucial times — these
problems just have never really
materialized."
The student-employees taking
the courses seem equally
enthusiastic. "I can come over
here," says an employee of a
Peninsula firm, "take a course, get
back to the job, work two hours
and hurry back for another
course. I'd lose a good half day if
I had to go to campus."
The network has also been well
received by the course instructors.
Those participating have had no
problem adjusting to the
television setup, and many have
asked to be scheduled again for
following quarters.
200 Courses
Last year over 200 courses,
some for credit and others not,
were provided by the network,
and more than 4000 persons to
industry took advantage of the
programming. All ten Stanford
engineering departments as well as
the departments of statistics,
computer science, applied physics
and chemistry have offered
courses.
In addition to this

engineering-oriented fare, the
system also broadcasts a complete
package of courses leading to a
Master of Business Administration
degree awarded by Golden Gate
University in San Francisco and a
variety of general interest courses.
The network utilizes four
channels in the microwave band
to carry its programming; thus
Stanford has the capacity to
broadcast four different classes
simultaneously. The four channels
used are among 31 that the FCC
made available in 1963 for
educational purposes. The high
frequency of the signal makes the
system essentially closed-circuit.
Special Rooms
The classes are telecast from
specially designed classrooms in
the Skilling Building on the
Stanford campus. There are two
cameras in each classroom; one is
at the back of the room, and the
other is suspended over the
instructor's desk.
The desk camera is usually
focused on a pad of paper, which
the teacher can use instead of the
blackboard; students actually in
the campus classroom must
therefore also be provided with
television monitors. The rear
camera's wide view of the class
and instructor and its zoom-ins on
speakers gives students at remote
locations the feeling of actually
being in class.
The network's audio system is
also designed to provide the
remote students with a feeling of
closeness. The remarks of
on-campus students are piped-out
along the network, and students
at the company classrooms can
communicate back with the
instructor and other students via a
specially licensed FM radio
hookup. The industry-based
students can thus "talk back" to
their television sets.
Paper-pushing
Paper-pushing between the
viewing students and the
instructor is handled by a
Stanford courier, who is
responsible for transporting class
handouts, homework, and exams,
which are administered at the

company sites under Honor Code
conditions.
The establishment of the
television system in 1967 was a
continuation of a twenty-year
tradition of cooperation between
Stanford and Bay Area companies
in providing members of industry
with access to University
educational resources.
Since 1953 over 1000 Master
of Science degrees have been
earned by working engineers
participating in the Stanford
Honors Cooperative Program
(HCP); that program enables
persons in industry who meet
normal departmental admission
requirements to attend regular
daytime classes at Stanford.
The director of the network,
Kenneth S. Down, recalls that the
HCP before the use of telecast
courses was "inefficient in terms
of time and energy lost in travel
to and from the campus." Down
also points out that "due to
classroom and parking space
limitations, only degree-seeking
Cost
Firms that affiliate with the
network are required to
contribute a share, pro-rated on
the basis of the company's gross
sales, of the $625,000
construction and continuing
development costs of the system.
They must also pay the cost of
equipping the receiving classrooms
on their grounds.
Despite these costs, many firms
find that they actually save
money by eliminating the
employee commute time involved
in taking classes on the Stanford
campus.
Ambitious Plans
The Stanford Instructional
Television Network has ambitious
plans for the future. It is presently
experimenting with the use of
videotape and has recently leased
a series of taped engineering
classes to a firm in Japan. The
network is also investigating the
feasibility of using satellite
broadcasting in cooperation with
other television organizations to
provide instruction to persons in
industry around the world.
A group of employees at a
Redwood City electronics plant is
seated watching television on
company time, but one can tell by
the pencils and notebooks in their
hands that this is no goldbricking
session. On the television screen a
Stanford professor calls his class
to order and begins to take roll.
"Hello, Ampex, are you
there?" One of the employees
responds by pressing a button and
then speaking into a microphone.
"How about you, IBM?" The roll
call continues with responses
coming in from around the Bay,
from points as far north as
Richmond and as far east as
Livermore. The Stanford
Instructional Television Network
is on the air.
Every week the Stanford
network transmits 160 hours of
live instruction to graduate and

non-degree-seeking students
working in industry. At 87
receiving classrooms located at 28
different firms throughout the
Bay Area the network's industrial
affiliates are proving that a
Stanford education does not have
to be limited to the Farm.

Stanford has the capacity to
broadcast four different classes
simultaneously. The four channels
used are among 31 that the FCC
made available in 1963 for
educational purposes. The high
frequency of the signal makes the
system essentially closed-circuit.
Special Rooms
The classes are telecast from
specially designed classrooms in
the Skilling Building on the
Stanford campus. There are two
cameras in each classroom; one is
at the back of the room, and the
other is suspended over the
instructor's desk.
The desk camera is usually
focused on a pad of paper, which
the teacher can use instead of the
blackboard; students actually in
the campus classroom must
therefore also be provided with
television monitors. The rear
camera's wide view of the class
and instructor and its zoom-ins on
speakers gives students at remote
locations the feeling of actually
being in class.
The network's audio system is
also designed to provide the
remote students with a feeling of
closeness. The remarks of
on-campus students are piped-out
along the network, and students
at the company classrooms can
communicate back with the
instructor and other students via a
specially licensed FM radio
hookup. The industry-based
students can thus "talk back" to
their television sets.
Paper-pushing
Paper-pushing between the
viewing students and the
instructor is handled by a
Stanford courier, who is
responsible for transporting class
handouts, homework, and exams,
which are administered at the

company sites under Honor Code
conditions.
The establishment of the
television system in 1967 was a
continuation of a twenty-year
tradition of cooperation between
Stanford and Bay Area companies
in providing members of industry
with access to University
educational resources.
Since 1953 over 1000 Master
of Science degrees have been
earned by working engineers
participating in the Stanford
Honors Cooperative Program
(HCP); that program enables
persons in industry who meet
normal departmental admission
requirements to attend regular
daytime classes at Stanford.
The director of the network,
Kenneth S. Down, recalls that the
HCP before the use of telecast
courses was "inefficient in terms
of time and energy lost in travel
to and from the campus." Down
also points out that "due to
classroom and parking space
limitations, only degree-seeking
Cost
Firms that affiliate with the
network are required to
contribute a share, pro-rated on
the basis of the company's gross
sales, of the $625,000
construction and continuing
development costs of the system.
They must also pay the cost of
equipping the receiving classrooms
on their grounds.
Despite these costs, many firms
find that they actually save
money by eliminating the
employee commute time involved
in taking classes on the Stanford
campus.
Ambitious Plans
The Stanford Instructional
Television Network has ambitious
plans for the future. It is presently
experimenting with the use of
videotape and has recently leased
a series of taped engineering
classes to a firm in Japan. The
network is also investigating the
feasibility of using satellite
broadcasting in cooperation with
other television organizations to
provide instruction to persons in
industry around the world.
A group of employees at a
Redwood City electronics plant is
seated watching television on
company time, but one can tell by
the pencils and notebooks in their
hands that this is no goldbricking
session. On the television screen a
Stanford professor calls his class
to order and begins to take roll.
"Hello, Ampex, are you
there?" One of the employees
responds by pressing a button and
then speaking into a microphone.
"How about you, IBM?" The roll
call continues with responses
coming in from around the Bay,
from points as far north as
Richmond and as far east as
Livermore. The Stanford
Instructional Television Network
is on the air.
Every week the Stanford
network transmits 160 hours of
live instruction to graduate and

non-degree-seeking students
working in industry. At 87
receiving classrooms located at 28
different firms throughout the
Bay Area the network's industrial
affiliates are proving that a
Stanford education does not have
to be limited to the Farm.
Enthusiastic
The firms subscribing to the
network's courses are enthusiastic
about the system. T.E. Lyons,
manager of education and training
for Lockheed Missile and Space in
Sunnyvale sees the significance of
the program for his firm as being
"improved morale [of the
employees taking the courses].
"A very large number of men
are willing to enroll in courses
which can do nothing but help
them personally and enhance their
value to the company."
Lyons adds that "the original
concerns about student-instructor
relationships, individual help,
homework and test
administration, the need to clarify
points during a lecture, equipment
failures at crucial times — these
problems just have never really
materialized."
The student-employees taking
the courses seem equally
enthusiastic. "I can come over
here," says an employee of a
Peninsula firm, "take a course, get
back to the job, work two hours
and hurry back for another
course. I'd lose a good half day if
I had to go to campus."
The network has also been well
received by the course instructors.
Those participating have had no
problem adjusting to the
television setup, and many have
asked to be scheduled again for
following quarters.
200 Courses
Last year over 200 courses,
some for credit and others not,
were provided by the network,
and more than 4000 persons to
industry took advantage of the
programming. All ten Stanford
engineering departments as well as
the departments of statistics,
computer science, applied physics
and chemistry have offered
courses.
In addition to this

engineering-oriented fare, the
system also broadcasts a complete
package of courses leading to a
Master of Business Administration
degree awarded by Golden Gate
University in San Francisco and a
variety of general interest courses.
The network utilizes four
