# Cameron—To 'Arrest All Beauty'
## 
### BARBARA HEINS 
Julia Margaret Cameron was an outrageous
woman. At the age of forty-eight, this highly
intelligent, free-spirited, eccentric, financially
comfortable Englishwoman took up
photography as another might do volunteer
work, and ended up shaking the
photographic world and establishing herself
as one of its masters.
An exhibition of fifty original
photographic prints made by Julia Cameron
is now on view at the Stanford Museum. The
exhibition includes works on loan from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art
Institute of Chicago and private collectors. It
is the largest and most carefully researched
exhibition of Mrs. Cameron's work to be held
on the West Coast.
'Victims'
Opposed to the character-less
portrait-manufacturing of her contemporaries
she completely disregarded convention and
pioneered her own style and technique. Her
persistent nature and overwhelming
enthusiasm brought her many fascinating
"victims" to sit for her camera. One by one
she led the great Victorians such as Alfred
Tennyson, Charles Darwin, Thomas Carlyle
and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow into her
converted chicken-coop studio where they
sat until she posed them to her taste.
In her efforts to "arrest all beauty" she
was often imperious. In 1868 Tennyson
delivered Longfellow to her studio saying,
"Longfellow, you will have to do whatever
she tells you. I shall return soon to see what
is left of you." Her results were certainly
worth any discomfort. Mrs. Cameron's
portraits of the personae of the Victorian
literary, artistic and scientific world are
unsurpassed in any medium.
Unlike her contemporaries who, in order to
cut down exposure time, let light stream in,
Mrs. Cameron carefully controlled light,
using it to model and emphasize features and

inner character of the sitter.
Self-taught, Proud
She received much harsh criticism on her
work because of her careless technique which
caused her prints to appear scarred, spotted
and lined. Unlike other photographers she
did not combine several negatives but
boasted her prints were always "From Life."
She was self-taught and very proud of the
fact. Afraid that the quality of her
photographs would suffer from enlarging the
prints, she declined use of normal sized
plates. Instead she used an enormous 30 inch
lens and huge plates ranging from 11x9 to
15x12 inches. Thus very long exposure was
necessary and sitters sometimes had to
remain motionless for as long as 7 minutes.
Julia Cameron appears to have been the
first person to have lenses especially made to
create soft focus, destroy detail and give poor
definition. Describing her technique, she said,
"When focusing and coming to something
which to my eye was very beautiful, I
stopped there, instead of screwing on the lens
to the more definite focus which all other
photographers insist on." The result is
beautiful, soft, glowing prints nakedly
realistic and, at the same time, ethereal.
The Wet-Collodion Process
The wet-collodion process used to take the
photographs was a very hectic one. The glass
plate had to be polished and coated with
collodion and rinsed in a mixture of silver
nitrate. Then the plate had to be rushed to
the camera, exposed and rushed back to the
dark room for immediate development
before the plate dried. (About seven minutes
in all). The plate had to then be dried, and
finally varnished. For Mrs. Cameron, all that
mattered was the expression of the subject —
dust spots, and lines were all unimportant
and did not detract from the art form.
Criticism of her work was divided.
Photographic News called her work

"Altogether repulsive" while Art Journal
compared her photography with the work c!
"Caravaggio, Tintoretto, Giorgione and
Velasquez."
The exhibition at Stanford also includes
many allegoric compositions by Mrs.
Cameron based on literature or religious
narratives. Towards this end boatmen became
King Arthus, Tennyson was wrapped in rags,
and parlor maids sat for her as the Madonna
while guests answered the doorbell. In these
photographs Mrs. Cameron is occasionally
guilty of over-sentimentalization
characteristic of her time.
In 1875 the Camerons left England for
Ceylon where they were both to spend the
rest of their lives. Julia continued to work as
avidly as before creating some beautiful
portraits of the natives which reflect her
total mastery of the medium.
In response to the photograph at left,
"The Rosebud Garden of Girls," critic Roger
Fry said, "We realize something of the
solemn ritual which surrounded these
beautiful women. How natural it seems to
them to make up and pose like this. They
have been so fashioned by the art of the day
that to be themselves part of a picture is
almost an instinctive function. Cameron
"bravely entitled her plate" after a line from
Tennyson's Maud — the verse which begins:
Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls
come hither, the dances are done,
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,
Queen lily and rose in one;
Shine out, little head, sunning over with
curls,
To the flowers, and be their sun.
Mrs. Cameron's Photographs from the
Life will continue in the Miedel Room of the
Museum through March 10.

ROSEBUD GARDEN OF GIRLS—The title of this portrait group of sisters, now part of the Cameron
Exhibit at the Stanford Museum, was taken from Tennyson's lyrical narrative Maud in which the hero is
restored to sanity through the power of love.

intelligent, free-spirited, eccentric, financially
comfortable Englishwoman took up
photography as another might do volunteer
work, and ended up shaking the
photographic world and establishing herself
as one of its masters.
An exhibition of fifty original
photographic prints made by Julia Cameron
is now on view at the Stanford Museum. The
exhibition includes works on loan from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art
Institute of Chicago and private collectors. It
is the largest and most carefully researched
exhibition of Mrs. Cameron's work to be held
on the West Coast.
'Victims'
Opposed to the character-less
portrait-manufacturing of her contemporaries
she completely disregarded convention and
pioneered her own style and technique. Her
persistent nature and overwhelming
enthusiasm brought her many fascinating
"victims" to sit for her camera. One by one
she led the great Victorians such as Alfred
Tennyson, Charles Darwin, Thomas Carlyle
and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow into her
converted chicken-coop studio where they
sat until she posed them to her taste.
In her efforts to "arrest all beauty" she
was often imperious. In 1868 Tennyson
delivered Longfellow to her studio saying,
"Longfellow, you will have to do whatever
she tells you. I shall return soon to see what
is left of you." Her results were certainly
worth any discomfort. Mrs. Cameron's
portraits of the personae of the Victorian
literary, artistic and scientific world are
unsurpassed in any medium.
Unlike her contemporaries who, in order to
cut down exposure time, let light stream in,
Mrs. Cameron carefully controlled light,
using it to model and emphasize features and

inner character of the sitter.
Self-taught, Proud
She received much harsh criticism on her
work because of her careless technique which
caused her prints to appear scarred, spotted
and lined. Unlike other photographers she
did not combine several negatives but
boasted her prints were always "From Life."
She was self-taught and very proud of the
fact. Afraid that the quality of her
photographs would suffer from enlarging the
prints, she declined use of normal sized
plates. Instead she used an enormous 30 inch
lens and huge plates ranging from 11x9 to
15x12 inches. Thus very long exposure was
necessary and sitters sometimes had to
remain motionless for as long as 7 minutes.
Julia Cameron appears to have been the
first person to have lenses especially made to
create soft focus, destroy detail and give poor
definition. Describing her technique, she said,
"When focusing and coming to something
which to my eye was very beautiful, I
stopped there, instead of screwing on the lens
to the more definite focus which all other
photographers insist on." The result is
beautiful, soft, glowing prints nakedly
realistic and, at the same time, ethereal.
The Wet-Collodion Process
The wet-collodion process used to take the
photographs was a very hectic one. The glass
plate had to be polished and coated with
collodion and rinsed in a mixture of silver
nitrate. Then the plate had to be rushed to
the camera, exposed and rushed back to the
dark room for immediate development
before the plate dried. (About seven minutes
in all). The plate had to then be dried, and
finally varnished. For Mrs. Cameron, all that
mattered was the expression of the subject —
dust spots, and lines were all unimportant
and did not detract from the art form.
Criticism of her work was divided.
Photographic News called her work

"Altogether repulsive" while Art Journal
compared her photography with the work c!
"Caravaggio, Tintoretto, Giorgione and
Velasquez."
The exhibition at Stanford also includes
many allegoric compositions by Mrs.
Cameron based on literature or religious
narratives. Towards this end boatmen became
King Arthus, Tennyson was wrapped in rags,
and parlor maids sat for her as the Madonna
while guests answered the doorbell. In these
photographs Mrs. Cameron is occasionally
guilty of over-sentimentalization
characteristic of her time.
In 1875 the Camerons left England for
Ceylon where they were both to spend the
rest of their lives. Julia continued to work as
avidly as before creating some beautiful
portraits of the natives which reflect her
total mastery of the medium.
In response to the photograph at left,
"The Rosebud Garden of Girls," critic Roger
Fry said, "We realize something of the
solemn ritual which surrounded these
beautiful women. How natural it seems to
them to make up and pose like this. They
have been so fashioned by the art of the day
that to be themselves part of a picture is
almost an instinctive function. Cameron
"bravely entitled her plate" after a line from
Tennyson's Maud — the verse which begins:
Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls
come hither, the dances are done,
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,
Queen lily and rose in one;
Shine out, little head, sunning over with
curls,
To the flowers, and be their sun.
Mrs. Cameron's Photographs from the
Life will continue in the Miedel Room of the
Museum through March 10.

ROSEBUD GARDEN OF GIRLS—The title of this portrait group of sisters, now part of the Cameron
Exhibit at the Stanford Museum, was taken from Tennyson's lyrical narrative Maud in which the hero is
restored to sanity through the power of love.

work, and ended up shaking the
photographic world and establishing herself
as one of its masters.
An exhibition of fifty original
photographic prints made by Julia Cameron
is now on view at the Stanford Museum. The
exhibition includes works on loan from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art
Institute of Chicago and private collectors. It
is the largest and most carefully researched
exhibition of Mrs. Cameron's work to be held
on the West Coast.
'Victims'
Opposed to the character-less
portrait-manufacturing of her contemporaries
she completely disregarded convention and
pioneered her own style and technique. Her
persistent nature and overwhelming
enthusiasm brought her many fascinating
"victims" to sit for her camera. One by one
she led the great Victorians such as Alfred
Tennyson, Charles Darwin, Thomas Carlyle
and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow into her
converted chicken-coop studio where they
sat until she posed them to her taste.
In her efforts to "arrest all beauty" she
was often imperious. In 1868 Tennyson
delivered Longfellow to her studio saying,
"Longfellow, you will have to do whatever
she tells you. I shall return soon to see what
is left of you." Her results were certainly
worth any discomfort. Mrs. Cameron's
portraits of the personae of the Victorian
literary, artistic and scientific world are
unsurpassed in any medium.
Unlike her contemporaries who, in order to
cut down exposure time, let light stream in,
Mrs. Cameron carefully controlled light,
using it to model and emphasize features and

inner character of the sitter.
Self-taught, Proud
She received much harsh criticism on her
work because of her careless technique which
caused her prints to appear scarred, spotted
and lined. Unlike other photographers she
did not combine several negatives but
boasted her prints were always "From Life."
She was self-taught and very proud of the
fact. Afraid that the quality of her
photographs would suffer from enlarging the
prints, she declined use of normal sized
plates. Instead she used an enormous 30 inch
lens and huge plates ranging from 11x9 to
15x12 inches. Thus very long exposure was
necessary and sitters sometimes had to
remain motionless for as long as 7 minutes.
Julia Cameron appears to have been the
first person to have lenses especially made to
create soft focus, destroy detail and give poor
definition. Describing her technique, she said,
"When focusing and coming to something
which to my eye was very beautiful, I
stopped there, instead of screwing on the lens
to the more definite focus which all other
photographers insist on." The result is
beautiful, soft, glowing prints nakedly
realistic and, at the same time, ethereal.
The Wet-Collodion Process
The wet-collodion process used to take the
photographs was a very hectic one. The glass
plate had to be polished and coated with
collodion and rinsed in a mixture of silver
nitrate. Then the plate had to be rushed to
the camera, exposed and rushed back to the
dark room for immediate development
before the plate dried. (About seven minutes
in all). The plate had to then be dried, and
finally varnished. For Mrs. Cameron, all that
mattered was the expression of the subject —
dust spots, and lines were all unimportant
and did not detract from the art form.
Criticism of her work was divided.
Photographic News called her work

"Altogether repulsive" while Art Journal
compared her photography with the work c!
"Caravaggio, Tintoretto, Giorgione and
Velasquez."
The exhibition at Stanford also includes
many allegoric compositions by Mrs.
Cameron based on literature or religious
narratives. Towards this end boatmen became
King Arthus, Tennyson was wrapped in rags,
and parlor maids sat for her as the Madonna
while guests answered the doorbell. In these
photographs Mrs. Cameron is occasionally
guilty of over-sentimentalization
characteristic of her time.
In 1875 the Camerons left England for
Ceylon where they were both to spend the
rest of their lives. Julia continued to work as
avidly as before creating some beautiful
portraits of the natives which reflect her
total mastery of the medium.
In response to the photograph at left,
"The Rosebud Garden of Girls," critic Roger
Fry said, "We realize something of the
solemn ritual which surrounded these
beautiful women. How natural it seems to
them to make up and pose like this. They
have been so fashioned by the art of the day
that to be themselves part of a picture is
almost an instinctive function. Cameron
"bravely entitled her plate" after a line from
Tennyson's Maud — the verse which begins:
Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls
come hither, the dances are done,
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,
Queen lily and rose in one;
Shine out, little head, sunning over with
curls,
To the flowers, and be their sun.
Mrs. Cameron's Photographs from the
Life will continue in the Miedel Room of the
Museum through March 10.

ROSEBUD GARDEN OF GIRLS—The title of this portrait group of sisters, now part of the Cameron
Exhibit at the Stanford Museum, was taken from Tennyson's lyrical narrative Maud in which the hero is
restored to sanity through the power of love.
Julia Margaret Cameron was an outrageous
woman. At the age of forty-eight, this highly
intelligent, free-spirited, eccentric, financially
comfortable Englishwoman took up
photography as another might do volunteer
work, and ended up shaking the

as one of its masters.
