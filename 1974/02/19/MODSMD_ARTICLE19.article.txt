# Windom Recreates Thurber
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
About humor, we all know very little. What
sent,, them rolling in the aisles a generation ago,
may seem dull-witted and stupid by today's
laugh-o-meter.
The humor of James Thurber, whose
near-sighted perspective on life covered the
pages of The New Yorker during much of the
second quarter of this century, seems to be
enduring. An eloquent translator has brought
Thurber's writing out from the pile of old New
Yorkers stashed in the garage and onto the
American stage in a one-man performance,
"William Windom Plays Thurber," which filled
Dinkelspiel Friday night.
Story-telling
The program, consisted of two acts, each
filled with seven five-to-ten minute stories,
evenly paced. Windom, who had brought
Thurber's sophisticated and warm humor to
millions a few yars ago in a short-lived NBC
television program, My World and Welcome To
It, told the stories with conversational charm.
Indeed, his story-teller's attitude toward the
material kept the evening from becoming an
arid "Honor Jim Thurber Night."
Instead, the evening rolled along, moving
from a Thurber parable to an editorial on the
hazards of relying upon foreign-phrase
guidebooks to an interview with a lemming. For
some, the delight of these stories was in the
nostalgic nuance. But all could admire the
tender way in which Windom gave spoken life
to Thurber's written words.
Weaned on Marshmellows
Thurber's most significant theme concerns
the ineffectual man, weaned on marshmellows,
bullied through childhood, and leashed through
life by those whose momentary strength is
greater than his. In "Teacher's Pet," Windom
plays Thurber's Wilbur (wtih two l's), a man
who has always had more brain than braun, and
is envious and contemptuous for those who
have those qualities in reversed amounts.
Having been beaten to the proverbial pulp in
the eighth grade by a tough, Willbur wants to
fight back but does not know quite how.
Windom's tragi-comic portrayal of Willbur, the
great American weakling, was one of the
evening's finest moments.
Willbur, however, is really just a more
serious variation of Thurber's most memorable
character, Walter Mitty. Anyone familiar with
high school forensics — or Danny Kaye's
interpretation of the character on film — knows
"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," that

wonderful world which exists only in Mitty's
playful absent mind.
In Mitty's imagination he is a ship captain in
a storm-tossed ocean, a fearless RAF fighter
pilot, a cocky and cool defendant whose expert
marksmanship is flaunted before the jury. In real
life he is a schnook, with the spine of a
well-cooked asparagus, addicted to
daydreaming. Again, Windom seemed to be
very much in touch with the character and
enjoyed what he was doing.
Thurber's Aesopian parables required more
acting than conversing, and to my mind, were
less effective than the anecdotal material. There
was a snag in the performance every time
Windom switched from the melodrama of the
parables to the mellow drama of the anecdotes.
To minimize the difference in material,
Windom played all the parables stage left and
then went to stage right or upstage to a desk
and typewriter for the anecdotes.
Technically, the production was sometimes
marred by a follow spotlight that didn't. Few
things exasperate a performer as delivering lines
in the dark because the spotlight operator fails
to respond to stage movement. The first few
times Windom seemed slightly annoyed, but by
the second act he had apparently resigned
himself to conditions as they were and went on,
a very Thurber-like approach to the problem.
More Fido Than Fifi
Not every piece was humorous. In one more
sensitive story, Windom told Thurber's account
of a poodle who was more Fido than Fifi, but
who put up with the haircuts and dog shows
because that, too, was part of life; besides, he
couldn't escape it. Its offbeatness did not deter
Thurber from relating the dog's plight to that
condition of living in a society which summons
us to be at our stupidest.
Windom was warmly received by the crowd,
and rightly so, because he did not play down to
his spectator but across from him. His
treatment never wandered into the precious,
and like Hal Holbrook's Mark Twain Tonight,
Windom's Thurber is performed without
introductory tributes about the author.
Whether Thurber's humor will endure
beyond this century is a purely speculative
matter. Windom has gracefully shepherded it
onto the stage, its wit and dignity intact.
Considering that old books and magazines are
today more prized for being art-deco than for
their literary value, the transfer may be a timely
one indeed.

things exasperate a performer as delivering lines
in the dark because the spotlight operator fails
to respond to stage movement. The first few
times Windom seemed slightly annoyed, but by
the second act he had apparently resigned
himself to conditions as they were and went on,
a very Thurber-like approach to the problem.
More Fido Than Fifi
Not every piece was humorous. In one more
sensitive story, Windom told Thurber's account
of a poodle who was more Fido than Fifi, but
who put up with the haircuts and dog shows
because that, too, was part of life; besides, he
couldn't escape it. Its offbeatness did not deter
Thurber from relating the dog's plight to that
condition of living in a society which summons
us to be at our stupidest.
Windom was warmly received by the crowd,
and rightly so, because he did not play down to
his spectator but across from him. His
treatment never wandered into the precious,
and like Hal Holbrook's Mark Twain Tonight,
Windom's Thurber is performed without
introductory tributes about the author.
Whether Thurber's humor will endure
beyond this century is a purely speculative
matter. Windom has gracefully shepherded it
onto the stage, its wit and dignity intact.
Considering that old books and magazines are
today more prized for being art-deco than for
their literary value, the transfer may be a timely
one indeed.
About humor, we all know very little. What
sent,, them rolling in the aisles a generation ago,
may seem dull-witted and stupid by today's
laugh-o-meter.
The humor of James Thurber, whose
near-sighted perspective on life covered the
pages of The New Yorker during much of the
second quarter of this century, seems to be
enduring. An eloquent translator has brought
Thurber's writing out from the pile of old New
Yorkers stashed in the garage and onto the
American stage in a one-man performance,
"William Windom Plays Thurber," which filled
Dinkelspiel Friday night.
Story-telling
The program, consisted of two acts, each
filled with seven five-to-ten minute stories,
evenly paced. Windom, who had brought
Thurber's sophisticated and warm humor to
millions a few yars ago in a short-lived NBC
television program, My World and Welcome To
It, told the stories with conversational charm.
Indeed, his story-teller's attitude toward the
material kept the evening from becoming an
arid "Honor Jim Thurber Night."
Instead, the evening rolled along, moving
from a Thurber parable to an editorial on the
hazards of relying upon foreign-phrase
guidebooks to an interview with a lemming. For
some, the delight of these stories was in the
nostalgic nuance. But all could admire the
tender way in which Windom gave spoken life
to Thurber's written words.
Weaned on Marshmellows
Thurber's most significant theme concerns
the ineffectual man, weaned on marshmellows,
bullied through childhood, and leashed through
life by those whose momentary strength is
greater than his. In "Teacher's Pet," Windom
plays Thurber's Wilbur (wtih two l's), a man
who has always had more brain than braun, and
is envious and contemptuous for those who
have those qualities in reversed amounts.
Having been beaten to the proverbial pulp in
the eighth grade by a tough, Willbur wants to
fight back but does not know quite how.
Windom's tragi-comic portrayal of Willbur, the
great American weakling, was one of the
evening's finest moments.
Willbur, however, is really just a more
serious variation of Thurber's most memorable
character, Walter Mitty. Anyone familiar with
high school forensics — or Danny Kaye's
interpretation of the character on film — knows
"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," that

wonderful world which exists only in Mitty's
playful absent mind.
In Mitty's imagination he is a ship captain in
a storm-tossed ocean, a fearless RAF fighter
pilot, a cocky and cool defendant whose expert
marksmanship is flaunted before the jury. In real
life he is a schnook, with the spine of a
well-cooked asparagus, addicted to
daydreaming. Again, Windom seemed to be
very much in touch with the character and
enjoyed what he was doing.
Thurber's Aesopian parables required more
acting than conversing, and to my mind, were
less effective than the anecdotal material. There
was a snag in the performance every time
Windom switched from the melodrama of the
parables to the mellow drama of the anecdotes.
To minimize the difference in material,
Windom played all the parables stage left and
then went to stage right or upstage to a desk
and typewriter for the anecdotes.

Windom's tragi-comic portrayal of Willbur, the
great American weakling, was one of the
evening's finest moments.
Willbur, however, is really just a more
serious variation of Thurber's most memorable
character, Walter Mitty. Anyone familiar with
high school forensics — or Danny Kaye's
interpretation of the character on film — knows
"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," that

wonderful world which exists only in Mitty's
playful absent mind.
In Mitty's imagination he is a ship captain in
a storm-tossed ocean, a fearless RAF fighter
pilot, a cocky and cool defendant whose expert
marksmanship is flaunted before the jury. In real
life he is a schnook, with the spine of a
well-cooked asparagus, addicted to
daydreaming. Again, Windom seemed to be
very much in touch with the character and
enjoyed what he was doing.
Thurber's Aesopian parables required more
acting than conversing, and to my mind, were
less effective than the anecdotal material. There
was a snag in the performance every time
Windom switched from the melodrama of the
parables to the mellow drama of the anecdotes.
To minimize the difference in material,
Windom played all the parables stage left and
then went to stage right or upstage to a desk
and typewriter for the anecdotes.
Technically, the production was sometimes
marred by a follow spotlight that didn't. Few
things exasperate a performer as delivering lines
in the dark because the spotlight operator fails
to respond to stage movement. The first few
times Windom seemed slightly annoyed, but by
the second act he had apparently resigned
himself to conditions as they were and went on,
a very Thurber-like approach to the problem.
More Fido Than Fifi
Not every piece was humorous. In one more
sensitive story, Windom told Thurber's account
of a poodle who was more Fido than Fifi, but
who put up with the haircuts and dog shows
because that, too, was part of life; besides, he
couldn't escape it. Its offbeatness did not deter
Thurber from relating the dog's plight to that
condition of living in a society which summons
us to be at our stupidest.
Windom was warmly received by the crowd,
and rightly so, because he did not play down to
his spectator but across from him. His
treatment never wandered into the precious,
and like Hal Holbrook's Mark Twain Tonight,
Windom's Thurber is performed without
introductory tributes about the author.
Whether Thurber's humor will endure
beyond this century is a purely speculative
matter. Windom has gracefully shepherded it
onto the stage, its wit and dignity intact.
Considering that old books and magazines are
today more prized for being art-deco than for
their literary value, the transfer may be a timely
one indeed.
About humor, we all know very little. What
sent,, them rolling in the aisles a generation ago,
may seem dull-witted and stupid by today's
laugh-o-meter.
The humor of James Thurber, whose
near-sighted perspective on life covered the
pages of The New Yorker during much of the
second quarter of this century, seems to be
enduring. An eloquent translator has brought
Thurber's writing out from the pile of old New
Yorkers stashed in the garage and onto the
American stage in a one-man performance,
"William Windom Plays Thurber," which filled
Dinkelspiel Friday night.
Story-telling
The program, consisted of two acts, each
filled with seven five-to-ten minute stories,
evenly paced. Windom, who had brought
Thurber's sophisticated and warm humor to
millions a few yars ago in a short-lived NBC
television program, My World and Welcome To
It, told the stories with conversational charm.
Indeed, his story-teller's attitude toward the
material kept the evening from becoming an
arid "Honor Jim Thurber Night."
Instead, the evening rolled along, moving
from a Thurber parable to an editorial on the
hazards of relying upon foreign-phrase
guidebooks to an interview with a lemming. For
some, the delight of these stories was in the
nostalgic nuance. But all could admire the
tender way in which Windom gave spoken life
to Thurber's written words.
Weaned on Marshmellows
Thurber's most significant theme concerns
the ineffectual man, weaned on marshmellows,
bullied through childhood, and leashed through
life by those whose momentary strength is
greater than his. In "Teacher's Pet," Windom
plays Thurber's Wilbur (wtih two l's), a man
who has always had more brain than braun, and
is envious and contemptuous for those who
have those qualities in reversed amounts.
Having been beaten to the proverbial pulp in
the eighth grade by a tough, Willbur wants to
fight back but does not know quite how.
