# Ex-Venceremos Member Among Kidnap Suspects
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
An article in Friday's San Francisco
Examiner identified former
Venceremos member Theo M.
Wheeler, 29, as one of two "prime
suspects in the abduction of Patricia
Hearst."
However, Charles W. Bates, special
agent in charge at the FBl's San
Francisco office, said, "We don't have
anything specific at all linking either
one with the Hearst case."
The Examiner also said that Wheeler
is a member of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA), which has
claimed responsibility for the
kidnaping. Wheeler escaped from the
Vacaville Medical Facility on Aug. 2,
1973 and has been a fugitive since
then.

Contacted on Friday by the Palo
Alto Times, former Venceremos
Central Committee member H. Bruce
Franklin said Wheeler was "a person
who asked to join Venceremos and
was considered a member while he was
in prison. It didn't mean much at the
time," Franklin said, "since there was
no way they — prisoners — could
participate much in the organization."
Franklin, a fired associate professor
of English here, added that a number
of other Venceremos members were
concerned with the Wheeler case and
there was a "big campaign to get
support" for him.
Telegrams Sent
Franklin's wife, Jane, also a
Venceremos member, said yesterday
that she recalled that "We had people
sending telegrams asking that he
[Wheeler] not be made a victim of
psychosurgery."
Last summer, Wheeler was serving a
10 year to life sentence in Soledad
Prison for assaulting a police officer
when authorities had him transferred
to Vacaville for a psychiatric
examination.
Wheeler wrote an article for the
April, 1972 issue of Pamoja
Venceremos, the organization's official
newspaper, calling upon prisoners "to
keep our revolutionary commitment
under all the harsh forms that
repression and mounting fascism are
taking."
The Examiner said that prison
officials had told Wheeler that "he
could not expect parole so long as he
belonged to Venceremos."
Wheeler then wrote a letter to
Venceremos renouncing his
membership and offering what Bruce
Franklin called "a fairly lengthy
criticism of the organization."
After his resignation, which
authorities later came to believe was
contrived, security arrangements for
Wheeler were relaxed. California Adult
Authority member Joseph Spangler

called the move "a judgment call that
went the wrong way."
Wheeler escaped, purportedly with
the aid of Venceremos members. At
the time, a State Department of
Corrections spokesman said "it was a
case of an inmate who conned his
keepers." He said Wheeler's letter of
resignation from Venceremos "was
taken at face value, unfortunately, or
he would not have been working on an
outside detail the day he disappeared."
Friend Of Cinque
While serving his term at Soledad,
Wheeler became a close friend of
Donald D. DeFreeze, whom the
Examiner, the San Francisco Chronicle
and The New York Times have
identified as the SLA's "Grand Field
Marshal Cinque."
According to the Examiner, prison
inmates who knew both DeFreeze and
Wheeler have identified their voices on
SLA tape recordings received by
Patricia Hearst's father, Randolph.
While they were in prison, DeFreeze
and Wheeler received visits and letters
from Russell Little, who is in custody
for the Nov. 9, 1973 assassination of
Oakland School Superintendent
Marcus A. Foster. The SLA has also
claimed responsibility for the Foster
killing.
