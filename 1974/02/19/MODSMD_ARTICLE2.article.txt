# Ex-Venceremos Member Among Kidnap Suspects
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
An article in Friday's San Francisco
Examiner identified former
Venceremos member Theo M.
Wheeler, 29, as one of two "prime
suspects in the abduction of Patricia
Hearst."
However, Charles W. Bates, special
agent in charge at the FBl's San
Francisco office, said, "We don't have
anything specific at all linking either
one with the Hearst case."
The Examiner also said that Wheeler
is a member of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA), which has
claimed responsibility for the
kidnaping. Wheeler escaped from the
Vacaville Medical Facility on Aug. 2,
1973 and has been a fugitive since
then.

Contacted on Friday by the Palo
Alto Times, former Venceremos
Central Committee member H. Bruce
Franklin said Wheeler was "a person
who asked to join Venceremos and
was considered a member while he was
in prison. It didn't mean much at the
time," Franklin said, "since there was
no way they — prisoners — could
participate much in the organization."
Franklin, a fired associate professor
of English here, added that a number
of other Venceremos members were
concerned with the Wheeler case and
there was a "big campaign to get
support" for him.
