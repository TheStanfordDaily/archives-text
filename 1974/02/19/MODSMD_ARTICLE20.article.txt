# O'Day Delights Small Crowd
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
It was an intimate gathering of
40 people that came to hear the
unusual style of Anita O'Day last
Wednesday night at the Boarding
House. Although the audience was
unresponsive at first, Anita
managed to warm them up by the
middle of the set.
The show started off slowly
with comedian Ricky Jay, whose
off-beat, intellectual brand of
humor and familiar magic tricks
pried a few luaghs from the
crowd.
Miss O'Day opened with
"There Will Never Be Another
You" in a swinging tempo. Swing
is a difficult concept to define;
some people have it and some
don't. Anita has it. The floor of
the hall rumbled with tapping
feet.

The first thing to notice about
her husky voice is that she uses it
like an instrument. One particular
technique that is unique to Anita
is her voice produces a sound like
that of a wah-wah guitar. At
times, it was effective; when
unnecessary, it was disconcerting.
Miss O'Day boasts a very
professional group of musicians
behind her: Richard Green, violin;
John Price, piano; A 1 Obidinski,
bass; and John Poole, drums.
Poole presented a clean,
complimentary piano solo during
"Soon It's Gonna Rain" (from the
Fantasticks), and Green's
articulate violin was spotlighted
on an instrumental called "Pent
Up House."
Besides in novative
arrangements, Anita also indulges
in some commendable scat singing

from time to time.
Miss O'Day pampered the
audience offering to do requests
and they began to respond. She
performed "Honeysuckle Rose"
at amazing speed, exhibiting her
ability to adapt quickly to
different time signatures and
accents.
A medley of the Beatles'
"Yesterday"and "Yesterdays"
preceded the last song, "Tea for
Two" executed at break-neck
speed, the piano, bass, and violin
echoing phrases scat-sung by
Anita. After a slow beginning,
Anita, a very personable
performer who has been singing
since the forties, made the evening
worthwhile.
