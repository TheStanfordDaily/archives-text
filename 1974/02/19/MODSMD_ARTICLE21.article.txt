# Prague Theater's Black Cabinet Technique
## A 						Fascinating Melange Of Effects 
### TOM FLEMING 
The Black Light Theater of
Prague offered a taste of the
Eastern European fantastic to the
tired San Francisco theater palate
last weekend at Veterans'
Auditorium. Under the auspices
of Robert Friedman Presentations
the Czech company provided a
fascinating melange of theatrical
means to express their bittersweet
view of life.
Nourished in the avant-garde
theater atmosphere of Prague in
the fifties, the company's
director, Jimi Sornec, has chosen
the striking 'black cabinet'
technique to convey his quirky
statements. Invisible under black
light, the stage is peopled by the
members of the company dressed
from head to toe in black. Their
unseen hands feverishly
manipulate various multi-colored
and significant objects. They glow
psychedelically, as if from some
perplexing internal source, while
they collide, connect, float, whirl,
and disappear with no strings
attached. The visual effect is
somewhere in the neighborhood
of animation and huge billboards
at night. Its method enjoys
endless possibilities for distorting
the 'normal' relations'of reality.
Little Islands
Four short sketches preceeded
intermission. For example:
"Chairs' — "Surfaces on supports,
little islands on sticks for the
backsides of the whole world, a
strange way of blocking space
with obstacles to the pull of
gravity." The corresponding stage
piece was a whimsical morality
play. We see three human players
interacting through stylized dance
and mime. They are accompanied
by a helpful train of inanimate
objects which lead a life of their
own, twisting, prodding and
crowning the characters.
Eventually the 'petit drama' is
resolved, the human pawns depart
and the stage is left to the glowing
objects which resolve themselves
into a single representation — a
floating flourescent chair
wobbling uncertainly above
ground level, its various parts
deciding finally to act in concert.
Through these four short
curtain-raisers the audience was
introduced to the wonders of the
medium. ("How do they do
that?") The group played with the
humorous possibilities (imagine
trying to cope with a violin that
had a mind of its own) and the
mysterious. The fourth piece was

part of "an eternal dialogue with
which we have breathed our way
into the present time," according
to the program. It presented a pair
of ghostly wormlike figures
undulating tall in the dark mouth
of the stage, exchanging a green
luminous kerchief. The complex
sound track provided eerie voice
cues and a rhythmic beat.
Out of the Ooze
The second half of the program
was occupied by a single work
entitled 'Diluvium.' It was an
abstract statement about the
development of man and his
unchanging nature. Beginning
with the primordial ooze — green
clad dancers writhing and odd sea
forms floating — they progressed
to a sort of cave man domestic
scene. The pre-human
protagonists wore huge
Neandrathal skulls dwarfing their
bodies' clumsy movements. They
waded through a plethora of
human ills including war and
competition over the favors of a
conspicuously unliberated
woman.

and emotional responses elicited
by the common theatrical
experience. Its connection with
the viewer is mental. By way of an
assault on our perceptions they
present a puzzle, a mental
problem realized through the
illusions of the black light
medium. The images presented are
those of the mind's eye. Their
patterns and color quality
resemble the flow of light and
pressure against the closed eye
more nearly than the physical
reality available to normal vision.
Through this form the Black Light
Theater is able to express abstract
ideas more or less clearly without
many of the realistic restrictions
that people and scientific nature
pose.
At intermission the stage lights
went up and the audience was
treated to a view of the company
as they looked in the light of day.
Their attitude was almost defiant.
At that point the American
cynical sophisticated reaction
began to have doubts. Sure it was
cutesy, sure it could have been

startling Eastern European
intellectual mind.
One finds the most
disconcerting mixture of goofy
humor and awesome gravity there.
It seems an almost painfully
perverse point of view which is
always able to see the cold
unapproachably bizarre side of
life. Like their black light
technique, those faces at
intermission seemed to say that
there's a great deal more here and
everywhere than you can see.
It is the rare event indeed
which confronts the American
complacent mind in a vivid jarring
manner. As such, the Black Light
Theater presents something of an
odd bird to American audiences —
the engaging, innovative theater —
something that San Francisco
sorely lacks. Promoter Robert
Friedman ought to be
congratulated for bringing this
stimulating slice of European
culture to our seeming imaginative
desert.

many of the realistic restrictions
that people and scientific nature
pose.
At intermission the stage lights
went up and the audience was
treated to a view of the company
as they looked in the light of day.
Their attitude was almost defiant.
At that point the American
cynical sophisticated reaction
began to have doubts. Sure it was
cutesy, sure it could have been

startling Eastern European
intellectual mind.
One finds the most
disconcerting mixture of goofy
humor and awesome gravity there.
It seems an almost painfully
perverse point of view which is
always able to see the cold
unapproachably bizarre side of
life. Like their black light
technique, those faces at
intermission seemed to say that
there's a great deal more here and
everywhere than you can see.
It is the rare event indeed
which confronts the American
complacent mind in a vivid jarring
manner. As such, the Black Light
Theater presents something of an
odd bird to American audiences —
the engaging, innovative theater —
something that San Francisco
sorely lacks. Promoter Robert
Friedman ought to be
congratulated for bringing this
stimulating slice of European
culture to our seeming imaginative
desert.
The Black Light Theater of
Prague offered a taste of the
Eastern European fantastic to the
tired San Francisco theater palate
last weekend at Veterans'
Auditorium. Under the auspices
of Robert Friedman Presentations
the Czech company provided a
fascinating melange of theatrical
means to express their bittersweet
view of life.
Nourished in the avant-garde
theater atmosphere of Prague in
the fifties, the company's
director, Jimi Sornec, has chosen
the striking 'black cabinet'
technique to convey his quirky
statements. Invisible under black
light, the stage is peopled by the
members of the company dressed
from head to toe in black. Their
unseen hands feverishly
manipulate various multi-colored
and significant objects. They glow
psychedelically, as if from some
perplexing internal source, while
they collide, connect, float, whirl,
and disappear with no strings
attached. The visual effect is
somewhere in the neighborhood
of animation and huge billboards
at night. Its method enjoys
endless possibilities for distorting
the 'normal' relations'of reality.
Little Islands
Four short sketches preceeded
intermission. For example:
"Chairs' — "Surfaces on supports,
little islands on sticks for the
backsides of the whole world, a
strange way of blocking space
with obstacles to the pull of
gravity." The corresponding stage
piece was a whimsical morality
play. We see three human players
interacting through stylized dance
and mime. They are accompanied
by a helpful train of inanimate
objects which lead a life of their
own, twisting, prodding and
crowning the characters.
Eventually the 'petit drama' is
resolved, the human pawns depart
and the stage is left to the glowing
objects which resolve themselves
into a single representation — a
floating flourescent chair
wobbling uncertainly above
ground level, its various parts
deciding finally to act in concert.
Through these four short
curtain-raisers the audience was
introduced to the wonders of the
medium. ("How do they do
that?") The group played with the
humorous possibilities (imagine
trying to cope with a violin that
had a mind of its own) and the
mysterious. The fourth piece was

part of "an eternal dialogue with
which we have breathed our way
into the present time," according
to the program. It presented a pair
of ghostly wormlike figures
undulating tall in the dark mouth
of the stage, exchanging a green
luminous kerchief. The complex
sound track provided eerie voice
cues and a rhythmic beat.
Out of the Ooze
The second half of the program
was occupied by a single work
entitled 'Diluvium.' It was an
abstract statement about the
development of man and his
unchanging nature. Beginning
with the primordial ooze — green
clad dancers writhing and odd sea
forms floating — they progressed
to a sort of cave man domestic
scene. The pre-human
protagonists wore huge
Neandrathal skulls dwarfing their
bodies' clumsy movements. They
waded through a plethora of
human ills including war and
competition over the favors of a
conspicuously unliberated
woman.

and emotional responses elicited
by the common theatrical
experience. Its connection with
the viewer is mental. By way of an
assault on our perceptions they
present a puzzle, a mental
problem realized through the
illusions of the black light
medium. The images presented are
those of the mind's eye. Their
patterns and color quality
resemble the flow of light and
pressure against the closed eye
more nearly than the physical
reality available to normal vision.

The second half of the program
was occupied by a single work
entitled 'Diluvium.' It was an
abstract statement about the
development of man and his
unchanging nature. Beginning
with the primordial ooze — green
clad dancers writhing and odd sea
forms floating — they progressed
to a sort of cave man domestic
scene. The pre-human
protagonists wore huge
Neandrathal skulls dwarfing their
bodies' clumsy movements. They
waded through a plethora of
human ills including war and
competition over the favors of a
conspicuously unliberated
woman.

and emotional responses elicited
by the common theatrical
experience. Its connection with
the viewer is mental. By way of an
assault on our perceptions they
present a puzzle, a mental
problem realized through the
illusions of the black light
medium. The images presented are
those of the mind's eye. Their
patterns and color quality
resemble the flow of light and
pressure against the closed eye
more nearly than the physical
reality available to normal vision.
Through this form the Black Light
Theater is able to express abstract
ideas more or less clearly without
many of the realistic restrictions
that people and scientific nature
pose.
At intermission the stage lights
went up and the audience was
treated to a view of the company
as they looked in the light of day.
Their attitude was almost defiant.
At that point the American
cynical sophisticated reaction
began to have doubts. Sure it was
cutesy, sure it could have been

startling Eastern European
intellectual mind.
One finds the most
disconcerting mixture of goofy
humor and awesome gravity there.
It seems an almost painfully
perverse point of view which is
always able to see the cold
unapproachably bizarre side of
life. Like their black light
technique, those faces at
intermission seemed to say that
there's a great deal more here and
everywhere than you can see.
It is the rare event indeed
which confronts the American
complacent mind in a vivid jarring
manner. As such, the Black Light
Theater presents something of an
odd bird to American audiences —
the engaging, innovative theater —
something that San Francisco
sorely lacks. Promoter Robert
Friedman ought to be
congratulated for bringing this
stimulating slice of European
culture to our seeming imaginative
desert.
The Black Light Theater of
Prague offered a taste of the
Eastern European fantastic to the
tired San Francisco theater palate
last weekend at Veterans'
Auditorium. Under the auspices
of Robert Friedman Presentations
the Czech company provided a
fascinating melange of theatrical
means to express their bittersweet
view of life.
Nourished in the avant-garde
theater atmosphere of Prague in
the fifties, the company's
director, Jimi Sornec, has chosen
the striking 'black cabinet'
technique to convey his quirky
statements. Invisible under black
light, the stage is peopled by the
members of the company dressed
from head to toe in black. Their
unseen hands feverishly
manipulate various multi-colored
and significant objects. They glow
psychedelically, as if from some
perplexing internal source, while
they collide, connect, float, whirl,
and disappear with no strings
attached. The visual effect is
somewhere in the neighborhood
of animation and huge billboards
at night. Its method enjoys
endless possibilities for distorting
the 'normal' relations'of reality.
Little Islands
Four short sketches preceeded
intermission. For example:
"Chairs' — "Surfaces on supports,
little islands on sticks for the
backsides of the whole world, a
strange way of blocking space
with obstacles to the pull of
gravity." The corresponding stage
piece was a whimsical morality
play. We see three human players
interacting through stylized dance
and mime. They are accompanied
by a helpful train of inanimate
objects which lead a life of their
own, twisting, prodding and
crowning the characters.
Eventually the 'petit drama' is
resolved, the human pawns depart
and the stage is left to the glowing
objects which resolve themselves
into a single representation — a
floating flourescent chair
wobbling uncertainly above
ground level, its various parts
deciding finally to act in concert.
Through these four short
curtain-raisers the audience was
introduced to the wonders of the
medium. ("How do they do
that?") The group played with the
humorous possibilities (imagine
trying to cope with a violin that
had a mind of its own) and the
mysterious. The fourth piece was

part of "an eternal dialogue with
which we have breathed our way
into the present time," according
to the program. It presented a pair
of ghostly wormlike figures
undulating tall in the dark mouth
of the stage, exchanging a green
luminous kerchief. The complex
sound track provided eerie voice
cues and a rhythmic beat.
