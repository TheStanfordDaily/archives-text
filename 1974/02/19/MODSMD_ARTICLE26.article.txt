# 'Not Embarrassed' By Top-Ranked Sun Devils
## Baseball Team Wins One Of Three 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
"They certainly didn't
embarrass themselves," said
Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young about his team's trip to
Arizona State last weekend.
Stanford, which won the
opening game 7-6 Friday night
but lost 9-4 and 2-0 Saturday,
plays host to Santa Clara today at
2 p.m. in Sunken Diamond.
"We're not going to see any
better competition than Arizona
State," said Young of the series
against the nation's top-ranked
collegiate team.
Some of the highlights of the
weekend for the Cardinals were:
— Two excellent pitching
performances by Mike Williamson
and Dave Frost. Williamson hurled
six strong innings before tiring in
the Friday night victory. Frost
surprised the Card coaching staff
by going the route in Saturday
night's shutout.
The Cards committed only

three errors, compared to ASU'S
nine miscues. What makes this
statistic so unusual is that three of
the four Card infield starters were
hampered with injuries and one
position had two players, Gary
Bei and Ken Egusa, playing third
base for the first time at Stanford.
Kim Hannaford couldn't play the
first two games because of a badly
bruised calf. Steve Davis was
slightly hobbled by a twisted
ankle and Bei came up with a sore
arm.
— Stanford's hitting at the top
of the order was excellent,
especially Friday night when the
Cards ambushed ASU ace Doug
Slocum, who was 13-1 last year,
for six runs in two innings.
"The trip has got to help build
up our approach," said Young,
who was pleased with the base
running, defense and pitching of
his team.
"We played pretty aggressive
baseball," said Young. The Cards
had two men, thrown out at the
plate gambling for the run.
"That's what we want to do;
make the other team make the

play," Young said.
Cards 7, ASU 6
Williamson's pitching, a brilliant
relief role by Bernie Hittner and
the Cards' early scoring barrage
highlighted the opening game
which was played before 3573
spectators at Phoenix Municipal
Stadium.
Hittner hurled the final two
innings, allowing a run in the
eighth on two consecutive singles,
then retired the side in order in
the ninth on two ground outs and
a fly ball to save the game.
Mark Lucich's triple, driving
home Bei, provided Stanford's
first run. Then the Cards tallied
five times in the second, capped
by Dave Baker's two-run single.
The Cards took advantage of
seven Sun Devil errors, four of
which were committed by third
baseman Jerry Maddox.
ASU 9, Cards 4
A sudden wildness by
Stanford's A 1 Arthur was one of
the factors in the Card defeat
Saturday afternoon at Sun Devil
Field in Tempe, Ariz.
Each time Arthur walked the

leadoff batter a run was scored by
ASU. Arthur issued seven walks in
six-plus innings, allowing six
earned runs. Four of the walks
were to Bump Wills, son of former
major leaguer Maury Wills. Wills
stole two bases and scored three
runs.
ASU 2, Stanford 0
Frost suffered his first defeat
in 11 collegiate decisions even
though he pitched brilliantly.
Rich Bethke, a junior college
All-American last year, limited the
Cards to five hits in gaining the
victory.
Stanford is now 2-4 for the
year.
