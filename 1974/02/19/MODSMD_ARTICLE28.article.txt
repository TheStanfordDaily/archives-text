# Stanford Flops In Compulsories
## Cal, Washington Down Gymnasts 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford gymnastics team
came back from a disastrous
showing in the compulsories
Friday night at Berkeley to give a
creditable performance in the
optionals here Saturday, but still
fell to Pac-8 rivals California and
Washington in the final
competition of the season before
the conference championships.
The total score for the two
evenings left Cal the winner with
317.02, runner up Washington
with 298.9 and Stanford last at
272.25.
Competing without their two
top all-around men, Steve Hug
because of sickness and Bob
Anderson due to a back injury,
the Cards were destroyed Friday
at Berkeley in the compulsories.
Cal was the victor at 156.27,
Washington 10 points back at
146.8, and Stanford a distant
third with 117.9.
Stanford, which had been
suffering from a lack of depth
even with Anderson and Hug, was
forced to enter only two men in
the parallel bars and the high bar,
automatically giving away points
since three score in each event.
Marcy Slips
Nothing seemed to go right for
the Cards Friday night. Ted
Marcy, who had scored 9.6 in the
compulsories three weeks before,
had trouble with his routine and

ended up with an 8.33. The only
performance for Stanford that
broke 9.0 was Howard Bessen's
9.03 rings routine. The Cards did
not win a single event.
It was an entirely different
story when Stanford faced the
same opponents on home ground
the following evening. Hug was
back, and even though Anderson
was still missing and Denny
Melendez had dropped out
because of a sore back, a crowd of
500 or so was on hand to see the
squad make up for the previous
night's disaster.
Hug started the meet with a
9.1 floor exercise routine to tie

Cal's Dave Eby in that event, the
only one the Cards did not win
outright on Saturday. In the
sidehorse, Marcy vindicated
himself by scoring an exceptional
9.6 routine to easily win the
event.
Bessen Victorious
The rings were the high point
of the evening. Bessen won the
event with a 9.4, but five other
competitors hit 9.0 or better. In
the vault, it was Hug winning his
second event of the night with a
9.0.
The parallel bars and high bar
were both won by Hug, at 9.4 and
9.3 respectively. Those two

events, which had been Stanford's
weakest, also turned out to be
weak for Washington, with the
result that the Cards beat the
Huskies in the optionals 154.35 to
152.1. Cal was the victor at
160.75.
Hug won the all-around for the
optionals with a 54.4 total for the
six events, but since he didn't
compete in the compulsories,
Cal's Tom Weeden won the overall
crown with a 103.23 total for the
two nights.
The Cards will spend the next
three weeks preparing for the
conference championships on
March 7-9 at Eugene, Ore.
