# UCLA Ruggers Ram Cards
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
UCLA didn't suffer a total
breakdown this weekend. The
Bruin rugby team dominated the
scrum Saturday, defeating the
Card ruggers 13-4 in Los Angeles.
"I don't know whether it was
the flight down or if we practiced
too much," said coach Pete
Kmetovic, "but we were very
sluggish in the first half."
The Bruins dominated the
scrum in the first half, scoring
three penatly kicks and a try.
Perry Scott booted two penalty
kicks and John Sullivan kicked

another. The Bruin try came on a
30-yard run by John Orbach.
The Cards came out hitting in
the second half and Stanford's
defense shut the Bruins out. "We
really dominated the second
half," said Kmetovic. But
Stanford missed three penalty
kicks and two tries in the period.
The Cards did manage to score an
unconverted try when Lawry
Lieberman ran 50 yards for the
score.
Kmetovic praised the play of
Lieberman, Jack Schultz, Eric
Test and John Snider.
Stanford will try to forget this
game tomorrow, when the Cards
face Sydney University. Sydney
has had a very successful
American tour, winning five
games and handing UCLA its only
loss of the year.
Kmetovic says he doesn't know
that much about Sydney but
commented, "I think they will be
a good test for us. We really
haven't put together two good
halves this year." Sydney has
good scrum backs, handles the ball
well and his five players with
international experience.

Bill Conway, who's been out
with a broken ankle, has been
given the green light by his
doctor, and may play tomorrow.
"Bill will really help us," said
Kmetovic. "He'll give us the spark
that's been missing."
Brian Burnett, captain of
Sydney's team, said, "We've
played some teams with good
tough forward play on this tour.
Although we beat UCLA 22-9,
they play a very physical game."
Burnett expects the Cards to
be equally physical and says
Sydney will counter with the
rucking technique. Sydney isn't a
big team so they will emphasize
"speed to the ball" and a lot of
switching. Burnett praised
American tackling and he said
that Sydney will not try to beat
the Cards one-on-one.
Kevin O'Hara is Sydney's
leading scorer. O'Hara scored two
penalty kicks and two tries against
the Bruins. He's a "big, strong
runner" according to Burnett.
Burnett also praised fullback
Tony Freestone. "He has been a
very dependable player on the
tour."
