# Bookstore Prosecutes All Cases
## Shoplifting--A Warranted Risk? 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"They're playing the game of 'let's rip off the bookstore'
and I'm playing the game of 'I'm going to catch you.' If I
catch them, I win."
It is a slow afternoon in the bookstore. Rick, the security
guard (who does not wish to reveal his last name), is leaning
over the second floor railing. He wants a good view of the
book section, where he says there have been a lot of thefts
recently.
"There's always people taking something, if it's a 19-cent
pen or a $40 book," Rick says."The bookstore doesn't
make any distinction."
All arrests are handled by the Stanford Police Services.
All cases are prosecuted. First offense shoplifting is petty
theft, a misdemeanor. Second offense shoplifting is a
felony. Penalties depend on the judge, but petty theft often
draws a fine and a suspended sentence.
A juvenile can have his arrest record sealed, Rick
explains, but those over 18 will get a permanent criminal
record.
Foresight Needed
"I catch a lot of pre-meds who are sure it's going to
screw them up, that they'll never get into medical school
with a record. I tell them they should have thought of that,
before," he says.
"I used to rip things off when I was a kid. If I'd ever
been caught over 18,1 could never be a policeman."
Although Rick arrests an average of one person a day, he
and another guard set a record last week of six arrests.
About half of those arrested are students. Almost
everybody has an excuse, but after consulting a lawyer,
almost everybody plead guilty.
With few exceptions, shoplifters are carrying enough
money to pay for what they take. One man arrested for
stealing $2.50 worth of merchandise was carrying $3000.
Different Types
All kinds of people shoplift. A visiting professor was
arrested several years ago, as was radical Kwonping Ho.
"There's no suspicious type," Rick says. Some people are
very cool, others telegraph their nervousness.

"Some people come in with an intent to steal and then
chicken out," Rick says. He points to a table on the ground
floor. "Last week I saw a guy take a big, expensive
accounting handbook. He stood right there looking around,
debating with himself if he should walk out of the store
with it. Finally he put it on that shelf and walked straight
out of the store."
Although students are not supposed to carry anything
into the store, many ignore the rule.
"The rule is to keep the honest people honest," Rick
says. "Say a guy walks in here with a book bag and then
gets some ideas, wonders if he can get away with anything.
If a person doesn't tempt himself, it's easier to stay
honest."
Honest People
He watches students with knapsacks or book bags
carefully, sometimes following them around the store if
they act suspiciously. "Look, there's a girl kneeling by the
shelves with an open bag next to her. But she probably
won't do it. You spend most of your day watching honest
people."
The girl puts back the book, stands up and walks away.
Rick notices a boy of junior high school age holding a small
address book.
"Little kids. I hate to bust them. That thing in his hand
isn't worth more than a dime." The boy slaps the book
against his palm. "He better not take it," Rick says.
Rick estimates that an item is stolen every 20 minutes.
The average value taken is $5, although it sometimes goes
much higher. Pens and pencils are stolen most frequently,
but tape cartridges, which combine high price and easy
portability, are also a popular target.
Tempting Target
Last week a cartridge which had been held as evidence
was returned to the shelves. Within hours, someone was
arrested for trying to steal it.
The pen displays tempt shoppers, because once the pen
has been pocketed, it is impossible to prove the shopper
didn't carry it into the store with him.
"Pen thieves you have to be on top
of," Rick says. "If you have the time,
you follow him around and see if he
sticks it in his pocket."
If he thinks the shopper may have
pocketed the pen absent-mindedly,
Rick tries to warn him before he leaves
the store. "I walk up to him and say
something subtle like, 'I bust people
who steal pens.' "
If the shopper admits the pen isn't
his and pays for it, Rick is satisfied.
"Being a deterrent is better than being
a hard-ass," he says.
Proud Mother?
Often people are arrested for taking
frivolous things. He says,"I caught a
guy ripping off a Mother's Day card
last year." Rick was tempted to get his
name, look up his home address, and
send the card to his mother with a
note: "Aren't you proud of your son?
He stole this for you."
Estimating the dollar cost of
shoplifting is difficult. "Shrinkage"
amounts to $50,000 a year, manager
Eldon Speed says, but mistakes in
paperwork account for much of this,
perhaps half. Rick guesses that $200 is
stolen each day. "We only catch one in
ten or fifteen at best," Speed says.
Losses cause higher prices.

Speed tries to avoid a Big Brother
atmosphere. There are no mirrors or
cameras in the store. "Our efforts are
to protect the majority," he explains.
"I believe that most of the people who
come in here don't steal."
The store has several security
guards, but Rick is the only one who
works full time.
High Risk
He hopes that students hear about (
arrests and understand the
consequences. "It amazes me still to
know that there are those willing to
run the risk of stealing and getting
caught, with the long-term
consequences for people interested in
law or medicine or education."
Rick graduated from Stanford last '
year. After completing night classes in
police work, he hopes to join the
Santa Clara Sheriffs force. His
bookstore job is good experience
teaching him how to cope with people.
"You learn to be mellow about being a
pig," Rick says.
When he gets bored, he roots for
people to steal. "See the guy down
there, holding the book? Maybe he'll
take it. Come on, I dare you. Slip it in
your pocket. Just try. Oh, he's taking
out some money. He's going to buy it.
Looks like everybody's honest today.
Maybe I'll go watch the pens."
