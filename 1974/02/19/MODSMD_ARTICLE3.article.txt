# Bookstore Prosecutes All Cases
## Shoplifting--A Warranted Risk? 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"They're playing the game of 'let's rip off the bookstore'
and I'm playing the game of 'I'm going to catch you.' If I
catch them, I win."
It is a slow afternoon in the bookstore. Rick, the security
guard (who does not wish to reveal his last name), is leaning
over the second floor railing. He wants a good view of the
book section, where he says there have been a lot of thefts
recently.
"There's always people taking something, if it's a 19-cent
pen or a $40 book," Rick says."The bookstore doesn't
make any distinction."
All arrests are handled by the Stanford Police Services.
All cases are prosecuted. First offense shoplifting is petty
theft, a misdemeanor. Second offense shoplifting is a
felony. Penalties depend on the judge, but petty theft often
draws a fine and a suspended sentence.
A juvenile can have his arrest record sealed, Rick
explains, but those over 18 will get a permanent criminal
record.
Foresight Needed
"I catch a lot of pre-meds who are sure it's going to
screw them up, that they'll never get into medical school
with a record. I tell them they should have thought of that,
before," he says.
"I used to rip things off when I was a kid. If I'd ever
been caught over 18,1 could never be a policeman."
Although Rick arrests an average of one person a day, he
and another guard set a record last week of six arrests.
About half of those arrested are students. Almost
everybody has an excuse, but after consulting a lawyer,
almost everybody plead guilty.
With few exceptions, shoplifters are carrying enough
money to pay for what they take. One man arrested for
stealing $2.50 worth of merchandise was carrying $3000.
Different Types
All kinds of people shoplift. A visiting professor was
arrested several years ago, as was radical Kwonping Ho.
"There's no suspicious type," Rick says. Some people are
very cool, others telegraph their nervousness.

"Some people come in with an intent to steal and then
chicken out," Rick says. He points to a table on the ground
floor. "Last week I saw a guy take a big, expensive
accounting handbook. He stood right there looking around,
debating with himself if he should walk out of the store
with it. Finally he put it on that shelf and walked straight
out of the store."
Although students are not supposed to carry anything
into the store, many ignore the rule.
"The rule is to keep the honest people honest," Rick
says. "Say a guy walks in here with a book bag and then
gets some ideas, wonders if he can get away with anything.
If a person doesn't tempt himself, it's easier to stay
honest."
Honest People
He watches students with knapsacks or book bags
carefully, sometimes following them around the store if
they act suspiciously. "Look, there's a girl kneeling by the
shelves with an open bag next to her. But she probably
won't do it. You spend most of your day watching honest
people."
The girl puts back the book, stands up and walks away.
Rick notices a boy of junior high school age holding a small
address book.
"Little kids. I hate to bust them. That thing in his hand
isn't worth more than a dime." The boy slaps the book
against his palm. "He better not take it," Rick says.
Rick estimates that an item is stolen every 20 minutes.
The average value taken is $5, although it sometimes goes
much higher. Pens and pencils are stolen most frequently,
but tape cartridges, which combine high price and easy
portability, are also a popular target.
Tempting Target
Last week a cartridge which had been held as evidence
was returned to the shelves. Within hours, someone was
arrested for trying to steal it.
The pen displays tempt shoppers, because once the pen
has been pocketed, it is impossible to prove the shopper
didn't carry it into the store with him.
