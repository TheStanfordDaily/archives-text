# Stanford Favored In NorCal Tennis
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If you remember last year's
Northern California
Intercollegiate tournament at all,
you probably remember it as a
joke. No Stanford player lost a
singles match to a player from any
of the other three schools — Cal,
USF and San Jose State.
While the Cards are favored to
repeat as NorCal champions at the
tournament which begins here
tomorrow, neither Coach Dick
Gould nor any of his players are
laughing.
Cal is a vastly improved team
over last year. Coach Kevin
Merrick landed one of last year's
most sought-after recruits, Trey
Waltke from St. Louis. Waltke has
immediately taken over the top
spot in the Cal lineup, ahead of
Peter Campbell of Australia.
Walke will be seeded second in
the tourney, behind John
Whitlinger of Stanford. Mark
Mitchell, who last year reached the
semis of this tournament, is
seeded third with Campbell
fourth.
In doubles, Chip Fisher will try
for a third straight championship
with a third partner. As a
freshman, Chip won with his
brother Rick. Last year, he won
with Whitlinger. This year, it'll be
the junior from Palo Alto teamed
with Chico Hagey.
Proven Ability
The Hagey-Fisher team has
been seeded second behind Cal's
duo of Steve Bartlett and Doug
Prouix, in deference to the proven
ability of the longtime Berkeley
pair.
Eight players, four of them
from Stanford, will receive first
round byes according to the draw,
which was unveiled yesterday at a
press luncheon at L'Omelette's
restaurant in Palo Alto.
Whitlinger, Mitchell, Fisher and
Hagey, as well as Campbell,
Waltke, Cal's Doug King and SJS's
Andy Moffat will be exempt from
tomorrow's 1 p.m. first round.
All these players will be in
action against first round winners
at 3 p.m. Gould anticipates no
problem with completing the first
round within the allotted two
hours, because of the new no-ad
scoring system which will be in
effect.
Sidone, Saviano Entered
In addition to the four seeded
players, Stanford is entering two
others in the singles event. Paul
Sidone will play Bruce Antal of
San Jose in the first round, while
Nick Saviano faces Albert Young
of USF.
Four of the Cards' top eight
players will not compete in this
week's tournament. Sandy Mayer,

Jim Delaney, Pat DuPre and Gene
Mayer are all playing at the
National Indoor Championships at
Salisbury, Md.
Admission to Wednesday's and
Thursday's action is free, and
students, faculty and staff can
watch the semifinals and finals
Friday and Saturday for only 50
cents.
Stanford will take a 1-0 dual
record into the NorCals, as a
result of a 7-2 win over Cal
State-Bakersfield on Friday. The
Cards lost the first two singles
matches, but won everything else.
Tim Noonan scored a double
triumph, winning at third singles
and teaming with Jake Warde to
win at second doubles.
* * *
Tennis Talk: Delaney scored
what Gould called "his biggest
win ever" Sunday at Salisbury,
beating France's fourth-ranked
player, Georges Goven, 6-4,
6-4... . Meanwhile, Mayer was
losing in the finals of the
Birmingham International Indoor
Tournament, bowing to Jimmy
Connors, 7-5, 6-3. Connors is
co-ranked number one in the
nation with Stan Smith. ... At
yesterday's luncheon, Stanford
officially announced that three of
the individual matches against
both USC and UCLA April 19-20
will be played on a special surface
in Maples Pavilion.

Intercollegiate tournament at all,
you probably remember it as a
joke. No Stanford player lost a
singles match to a player from any
of the other three schools — Cal,
USF and San Jose State.
While the Cards are favored to
repeat as NorCal champions at the
tournament which begins here
tomorrow, neither Coach Dick
Gould nor any of his players are
laughing.
Cal is a vastly improved team
over last year. Coach Kevin
Merrick landed one of last year's
most sought-after recruits, Trey
Waltke from St. Louis. Waltke has
immediately taken over the top
spot in the Cal lineup, ahead of
Peter Campbell of Australia.
Walke will be seeded second in
the tourney, behind John
Whitlinger of Stanford. Mark
Mitchell, who last year reached the
semis of this tournament, is
seeded third with Campbell
fourth.
In doubles, Chip Fisher will try
for a third straight championship
with a third partner. As a
freshman, Chip won with his
brother Rick. Last year, he won
with Whitlinger. This year, it'll be
the junior from Palo Alto teamed
with Chico Hagey.
Proven Ability
The Hagey-Fisher team has
been seeded second behind Cal's
duo of Steve Bartlett and Doug
Prouix, in deference to the proven
ability of the longtime Berkeley
pair.
Eight players, four of them
from Stanford, will receive first
round byes according to the draw,
which was unveiled yesterday at a
press luncheon at L'Omelette's
restaurant in Palo Alto.
Whitlinger, Mitchell, Fisher and
Hagey, as well as Campbell,
Waltke, Cal's Doug King and SJS's
Andy Moffat will be exempt from
tomorrow's 1 p.m. first round.
All these players will be in
action against first round winners
at 3 p.m. Gould anticipates no
problem with completing the first
round within the allotted two
hours, because of the new no-ad
scoring system which will be in
effect.
Sidone, Saviano Entered
In addition to the four seeded
players, Stanford is entering two
others in the singles event. Paul
Sidone will play Bruce Antal of
San Jose in the first round, while
Nick Saviano faces Albert Young
of USF.
Four of the Cards' top eight
players will not compete in this
week's tournament. Sandy Mayer,

Jim Delaney, Pat DuPre and Gene

National Indoor Championships at
Salisbury, Md.
Admission to Wednesday's and
Thursday's action is free, and
students, faculty and staff can
watch the semifinals and finals
Friday and Saturday for only 50
cents.
Stanford will take a 1-0 dual
record into the NorCals, as a
result of a 7-2 win over Cal
State-Bakersfield on Friday. The
Cards lost the first two singles
matches, but won everything else.
Tim Noonan scored a double
triumph, winning at third singles
and teaming with Jake Warde to
win at second doubles.

player, Georges Goven, 6-4,

Birmingham International Indoor
Tournament, bowing to Jimmy
Connors, 7-5, 6-3. Connors is
co-ranked number one in the
nation with Stan Smith. ... At
yesterday's luncheon, Stanford
