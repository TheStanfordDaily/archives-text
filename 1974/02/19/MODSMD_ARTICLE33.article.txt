# LSJUMB Third In 'Great Canoe Race'
## 
### 
In a performance that could
only be described as grossly
inebriated, the heavily
favored Stanford Canoe team
(a subsidiary of the Stanford
band) blew a healthy first
minute lead and finished
third behind USC and UCLA
in the second annual Busch
Gardens "Great Canoe Race"
which ended yesterday
afternoon in Van Nuys.
Complete details tomorrow.
