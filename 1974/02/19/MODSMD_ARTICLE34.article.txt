# Cagers Break Even In Washington
## Fast-Breaking Cards Coast Past Cougars 
### PETE BHATIA 
PULLMAN, Wash. — Stanford
used a fast-breaking offense and a
tenacious zone defense to win its
fifth game in a row Saturday
night, a 72-51 victory over
Washington State's inept Cougars.
The Cardinals, playing in
front of 7200 screaming maniacs
at WSU's beautiful new
Performing Arts Coliseum, were
never really threatened by the
Cougars, who made more
turnovers (22) than baskets (21).
For Stanford, the towering
front line of Rich Kelley, Ed
Schweitzer and Tim Patterson
dominated. Schweitzer played a
brilliant game, scoring a game-high
22 points and contributing 11
rebounds and two assists.
Kelley, although somewhat
bothered by the Cougar zone
defense, chipped in 14 points, 11
boards, five assists and six blocked
shots. Patterson added 10 points.
The Cougars jumped out to a
2-0 lead on a Brad Jackson
20-foot jump shot over Stanford's
1-2-2 zone. From then on,
however, WSU was never a factor.
Double-Pump Layup
After the teams exchanged
several baskets, Melvin Arterberry
put the Cards on top to stay at
10-8 on a driving, double-pump
layup. Two Cougar turnovers and
long jumpers by Schweitzer and
Jim Montague opened the margin
to 14-8.
But that was only the
beginning. Over the next 10
minutes, the Cards outscored the
Cougars 18-2 to increase their
advantage to 32-14. Schweitzer
dominated play during the
Cardinal barrage, scoring eight
points and grabbing four
rebounds.
The Cards were consistently
getting three-on-one fast breaks
throughout the half against the
Cougar press — and they did it
easily. After an initial inbounds
pass, the ball went to Kelley, who
was positioned near the top of the
key. He simply pivoted and passed
to either Montague, Arterberry,
Mark Gilberg or Scott Trobbe
streaking down the sidelines into
the forecourt.
Stanford's tough zone limited
WSU to 8-23 from the field during
the first half (32 percent), while
the Cards ripped the nets 16 of 27
times (59.3 percent) for a 32-18
halftime lead.
Stanford easily controlled the
second half, rolling to its biggest
margin of the contest at 62-33 on
a Ben Bluitt jumper with 5:11
remaining.
The Cougars never threatened
in the second period, and their
normally emotional coach, George
"the Rave" Raveling, never left
his seat on the bench.
Puidokas Contained
Cougar center Steve Puidokas
(6-IV/2, 258) was obviously
hampered by a cheekbone injury
suffered two weeks ago against
Washington and managed only
eight points and five rebounds. He
was forced to wear a facemask

resembling a diver's goggles, and
Stanford's front line easily
controlled him.
"He didn't play as well as he
could," Kelley said. "Our zone
bothered him. When he got inside
he didn't know where the defense
was coming from. We had two
guys converging and he panicked
on his shots."
The Cardinal zone also
controlled supersub Norton
Barnhill, who scored 45 points
last weekend in his first two
varsity games. Saturday he only
managed 11
Perhaps the brightest note for
Stanford was the resurgent play of
forward Scott Trobbe, who scored
six points and threw several
beautiful passes, two for layups
on backdoor plays to Schweitzer
and Arterberry.

END OF A DYNASTY?—BiII Walton (32) and Keith Wilkes looked
disappointed last year at Pauley Pavilion when this Stanford shot went
through the hoop, but they were disbelieving over the weekend in
Oregon. Oregon State and Oregon both defeated the Bruins, snapping
UCLA's conference winning streak at 49 games and leaving the Pac-8
championship in doubt for the first time since 1966. UCLA and USC
are both 7-2 in the league and 18-3 overall.
