# Final Event Decisive...Again
## Cards Edge UCLA Swimmers 
### STEVE BAKER 
Coach Jim Gaughran's
swimmers traveled to Los Angeles
over the weekend with the
intention of overlooking USC's
powerful Trojans and defeating
UCLA's Bruins. That's exactly
what happened.
After USC trounced the Cards
82-31 Friday night, Stanford
came back on Saturday, winning
the last event in a finish
reminiscent of last year's victory
over the Bruins. This time the
final score was Stanford 60,
UCLA 55.
At USC, the Cards never really
got off the ground. After winning
the medley relay, Stanford lost
the next nine events in a row. The
Trojans swept the 1000, 500, 200
and 100-yard freestyle events
besides the 200 backstroke and
the 200 butterfly.
In the 50, SC's Joe Bottom
touched out Dave Fairbank, 20.71
to 20.96. John Hencken won the
breaststroke but lost the
individual medley. Wayne Wager
was the only other Cardinal to
place higher than third, taking
second in both diving events.
The encounter at UCLA was an
entirely different matter. This was
the reason Stanford went to Los
Angeles, and as expected the two
teams put up a great fight. . . that
is, until the last event.
The meet started, for Stanford,
on a discouraging note, as the
Cards lost the medley by three
tenths of a second. But things
began to see-saw. In the second
event Terry Sutton and Steve
Strong put the Cards right back in
the swing of things with a sweep

of the 1000 over favored Bruin
Rex Favero.
UCLA came back to sweep the
200 over Bruce Goodwin and
Craig Van Zandt. Stanford
swimmers then won four of the
next five events. Another Bruin
sweep in the fly was followed by a
Cardinal sweep in the 100. In the
500, one of the most exciting
events of the day, Favero edged
Strong and Sutton. Favero did a
4:41.0 to Strong's 4:41.1 and
Sutton's 4:41.7.
Going into the last event,
Stanford was trailing 55-53; the
winner of the free relay would be
the winner of the meet. It was
here that UCLA added a new
dimension to the cause of
unsportsmanlike conduct.
Realizing that the chances of
beating Stanford's sprinters were
next to nil, UCLA had its official
team swim off to the side in lane
one while an unofficial team
swam next to the Cards.
As Stanford was building a
slight lead over UCLA's official
team, the relay next to the Cards
was getting further and further
behind — intentionally. By the
time the Cards' third man, Martin
Pedley, took off, it was obvious
that this "unofficial" team's sole
purpose was to interfere with
Stanford's relay.
By dropping two laps behind,
this "unofficial" relay timed its
dives so as to disrupt the Stanford
swimmer already in the water. It
didn't make much difference,
however. Stanford stomped
UCLA's official team by well over
a second to win the meet.
Stanford had three double

winners. Diver Wayne Wager
scored firsts on both the one- and
three-meter boards. Fairbank won
the 50 and placed ahead of
Goodwin in the sweep of the 100.
In the 100 Dave clocked a 46.3 to
Bruce's 46.9.
Sutton and Strong were key
factors in the final outcome as
they scored 12 points between
them in the distances, normally
strong events for UCLA. Wager's
victories on the boards were also
instrumental in the win.
UCLA had some fine
performances, but Stanford's
freestyle relay of Fairbank,
Goodwin, Pedley and Dean
Anderson proved that the Bruins
had been decidedly outclassed.
Indeed, by the end of the free
relay UCLA didn't have much
class at all.

time the Cards' third man, Martin
Pedley, took off, it was obvious
that this "unofficial" team's sole
purpose was to interfere with
Stanford's relay.
By dropping two laps behind,
this "unofficial" relay timed its
dives so as to disrupt the Stanford
swimmer already in the water. It
didn't make much difference,
however. Stanford stomped
UCLA's official team by well over
a second to win the meet.
Stanford had three double

winners. Diver Wayne Wager
scored firsts on both the one- and
three-meter boards. Fairbank won
the 50 and placed ahead of
Goodwin in the sweep of the 100.
In the 100 Dave clocked a 46.3 to
Bruce's 46.9.
Sutton and Strong were key
factors in the final outcome as
they scored 12 points between
them in the distances, normally
strong events for UCLA. Wager's
victories on the boards were also
instrumental in the win.
UCLA had some fine
performances, but Stanford's
freestyle relay of Fairbank,
Goodwin, Pedley and Dean
Anderson proved that the Bruins
had been decidedly outclassed.
Indeed, by the end of the free
relay UCLA didn't have much
class at all.
Coach Jim Gaughran's
swimmers traveled to Los Angeles
over the weekend with the
intention of overlooking USC's
powerful Trojans and defeating
UCLA's Bruins. That's exactly
what happened.
After USC trounced the Cards
82-31 Friday night, Stanford
came back on Saturday, winning
the last event in a finish
reminiscent of last year's victory
over the Bruins. This time the
final score was Stanford 60,
UCLA 55.
At USC, the Cards never really
got off the ground. After winning
the medley relay, Stanford lost
the next nine events in a row. The
Trojans swept the 1000, 500, 200
and 100-yard freestyle events
besides the 200 backstroke and
the 200 butterfly.
In the 50, SC's Joe Bottom
touched out Dave Fairbank, 20.71
to 20.96. John Hencken won the
breaststroke but lost the
individual medley. Wayne Wager
was the only other Cardinal to
place higher than third, taking
second in both diving events.
The encounter at UCLA was an
entirely different matter. This was
the reason Stanford went to Los
Angeles, and as expected the two
teams put up a great fight. . . that
is, until the last event.
The meet started, for Stanford,
on a discouraging note, as the
Cards lost the medley by three
tenths of a second. But things
began to see-saw. In the second
event Terry Sutton and Steve
Strong put the Cards right back in
the swing of things with a sweep

of the 1000 over favored Bruin
Rex Favero.
UCLA came back to sweep the
200 over Bruce Goodwin and
Craig Van Zandt. Stanford
swimmers then won four of the
next five events. Another Bruin
sweep in the fly was followed by a
Cardinal sweep in the 100. In the
500, one of the most exciting
events of the day, Favero edged
Strong and Sutton. Favero did a
4:41.0 to Strong's 4:41.1 and
Sutton's 4:41.7.
Going into the last event,
Stanford was trailing 55-53; the
winner of the free relay would be
the winner of the meet. It was
here that UCLA added a new
dimension to the cause of
unsportsmanlike conduct.
Realizing that the chances of
beating Stanford's sprinters were
next to nil, UCLA had its official
team swim off to the side in lane
one while an unofficial team
swam next to the Cards.
