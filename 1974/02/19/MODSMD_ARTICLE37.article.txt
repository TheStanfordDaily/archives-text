## 'Mortal' Bruins Limp Home 
### 
One fateful weekend in the
Northwest may have changed the
face of college basketball for the
first time in eight years. The
UCLA Bruins got caught with
their mortality showing.
"We don't deserve to be No.
1," admitted the wizard of
Westwood, John Wooden, his
wizardry tarnished after the
Bruins lost back-to-back
conference games, 61-57 to
Oregon State and 56-51 to
Oregon, for the first time since
1966. Then, as now, the
forbidding aura of stuffy
gymnasiums crowded with rabid
fans rattled the visiting Bruins.
UCLA committed 11 turnovers
in the first half of Saturday's
televised loss to Oregon, and 21
Friday night at Corvallis. The
Beavers lost only eight, allowing

them to make up for a drastic
shooting and rebounding
disadvantage and snap UCLA's
Pacific Eight win streak at 49
games.
"I have said all along that the
one thing this team seems to lack
is the killer instinct," said Wooden
after Friday's loss. "Now I'm just
concerned about winning the
conference." Indeed the Bruins,
who habitually profess a disdain
for non-conference battles such as
that with Notre Dame in favor of
concentrating on "the more
important conference games,"
now had better take even more
seriously the prospect of putting
their own house in order.
The reason sits right across the
Santa Monica Freeway: Bob
Boyd's perpetual second-fiddlers
from USC who swept the squads
which were sweeping UCLA, and
now hold the same league and
season records as the Bruins going
into the final five conference
battles.
John Lambert scored 25 points
Friday as the Trojans coasted past
Oregon 76-61, and guard Dan
Anderson tallied 20 second-half
points and made 13 straight free
throws to lift Troy over Oregon
State, 60-53, Saturday night.
Rare starter Bruce Coldren was
the star of Oregon's win over
UCLA, scoring 24 points and
rallying the Duck squad each time
the Bruins closed in. The Ducks
shot 62 percent in the first half,
and the Oregon defense stifled
All-American Bill Walton, holding
him to 11 points in the game and
three rebounds in the first half.
Buried amid Saturday's tumult
was visiting California's loss to
Washington, 86-78. The Bears
took an early 19-11 lead on the
shooting of Rickie Hawthorne (23
points) but fell to a second-half
barrage (19 points) by Husky
Larry Pounds. Pounds finished
with 25 points.
