# Possible Presidential Candidate
## Mondale Stresses 'Accountability' 
### BILL ROSS 
The nation desperately needs a
president who will be accountable to
the people, Senator Walter Mondale,
D-Minn., told Democrats at a fund
raising event in Palo Alto on Friday
night.
"The key problem running through
Watergate is Nixon's notion that the
president is above the law," Mondale
declared. "We need a strong president,
but he must be an open and legal
president."
Speaking to a group of about 75
Defnocrats, Mondale stated, "If we
want a just country, we must have a
progressive and just president."
Nixon's defiance of the courts is
"flatly illegal," Mondale noted.
Mondale said that while intraparty
quarrels can be good for the party,
they should never reach a level of
bitterness where they prevent the
party from winning elections.
When the Democrats are divided,
"you get Ronald Reagan and Richard
Nixon and those characters who
shouldn't even be dogcatchers,"
Mondale observed.
"The Democratic Party was at its
greatest when it was a progressive
party and a liberal party," Mondale
stated. "It took on the tough issues. It
has been the party that worried about
children and old people and problems
such as inflation."
In an interview with Daily and
KZSU reporters, Mondale admitted
that he is considering the possibility of
running for president in 1976. His
travels throughout the nation are
intended to test public receptivity to
his possible candidacy. But he
emphasizes that he is a full time
senator, traveling only when the
Congress is not in session.

Although Mondale hopes to raise
$100,000 this year, he declared, "I'm
not trying to buy publicity."
Admitting that he is not well known,
he said that he is attempting to appear
before a maximum number of
community groups.
Mondale declared that the
Democrats have an excellent chance of
winning the next presidential election.
"Vietnam is behind us and the racial
issue has gone from the South," he
explained. "The Democrats are a truly
national party again. We've been
defeated and we can see the
consequences of defeat. I'm hopeful
that the party won't be split again."
Mondale stated that he hopes to
leassemble the traditional
constituency of the Democratic Party.
But this does not mean presenting
himself as a centrist candiate, he
emphasized.
"What I want is a principled
victory," Mondale said. "It's easy to
be a political whore. We all know how
to play that game."
If Mondale decides that he wants
the nomination, he will enter the race

even if Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., also runs.
Mondale refused to speculate about
whether or not the House of
Representatives will impeach Nixon
this year, or if the Senate would
convict him if he were impeached.
Stressing the issue of accountability,
Mondale said that the real issue in
Watergate now is whether the
President will release all of the
evidence in his possession.
"There is a mammoth gap between
what Jaworski [special Watergate
prosecutor] says Nixon said and what
Nixon says," Mondale remarked.
Also attending the fund raising
event was William Matson Roth, a
candidate for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination. Roth
cautioned the audience against
overconfidence in the upcoming race
for the governorship.
"I think we have a very formidable
opponent in [GOP candidate
Houston] Flournoy, but more than
that, as I go around the state I find an
apathy toward the whole political
process."

$100,000 this year, he declared, "I'm
not trying to buy publicity."
Admitting that he is not well known,
he said that he is attempting to appear
before a maximum number of
community groups.
Mondale declared that the
Democrats have an excellent chance of
winning the next presidential election.
"Vietnam is behind us and the racial
issue has gone from the South," he
explained. "The Democrats are a truly
national party again. We've been
defeated and we can see the
consequences of defeat. I'm hopeful
that the party won't be split again."
Mondale stated that he hopes to
leassemble the traditional
constituency of the Democratic Party.
But this does not mean presenting
himself as a centrist candiate, he
emphasized.
"What I want is a principled
victory," Mondale said. "It's easy to
be a political whore. We all know how
to play that game."
If Mondale decides that he wants
the nomination, he will enter the race

even if Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., also runs.
Mondale refused to speculate about
whether or not the House of
Representatives will impeach Nixon
this year, or if the Senate would
convict him if he were impeached.
Stressing the issue of accountability,
Mondale said that the real issue in
Watergate now is whether the
President will release all of the
evidence in his possession.
"There is a mammoth gap between
what Jaworski [special Watergate
prosecutor] says Nixon said and what
Nixon says," Mondale remarked.
Also attending the fund raising
event was William Matson Roth, a
candidate for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination. Roth
cautioned the audience against
overconfidence in the upcoming race
for the governorship.
"I think we have a very formidable
opponent in [GOP candidate
Houston] Flournoy, but more than
that, as I go around the state I find an
apathy toward the whole political
process."

YALE TALE — A scheduled debate at Yale University between Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley (above) and Roy Innis, executive director of
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), was cancelled over the weekend.
The nation desperately needs a
president who will be accountable to
the people, Senator Walter Mondale,
D-Minn., told Democrats at a fund
raising event in Palo Alto on Friday
night.
"The key problem running through
Watergate is Nixon's notion that the
president is above the law," Mondale
declared. "We need a strong president,
but he must be an open and legal
president."
Speaking to a group of about 75
Defnocrats, Mondale stated, "If we
want a just country, we must have a
progressive and just president."
Nixon's defiance of the courts is
"flatly illegal," Mondale noted.
Mondale said that while intraparty
quarrels can be good for the party,
they should never reach a level of
bitterness where they prevent the
party from winning elections.
When the Democrats are divided,
"you get Ronald Reagan and Richard
Nixon and those characters who
shouldn't even be dogcatchers,"
Mondale observed.
"The Democratic Party was at its
greatest when it was a progressive
party and a liberal party," Mondale
stated. "It took on the tough issues. It
has been the party that worried about
children and old people and problems
such as inflation."
In an interview with Daily and
KZSU reporters, Mondale admitted
that he is considering the possibility of
running for president in 1976. His
travels throughout the nation are
intended to test public receptivity to
his possible candidacy. But he
emphasizes that he is a full time
senator, traveling only when the
Congress is not in session.

Although Mondale hopes to raise
$100,000 this year, he declared, "I'm
not trying to buy publicity."
Admitting that he is not well known,
