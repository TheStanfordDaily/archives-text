# Wrestlers Win Eighth Dual Match
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling team tied the school
record of eight dual match wins in one season
Saturday, downing Cal Poly-Pomona 36-15 at
Pomona.
The Cards recorded their seventh victory
Friday in Santa Barbara by defeating UC-Santa
Barbara 34-12, but Stanford's attempt to break
the record was foiled in the final match of the
weekend, as a tough Cal State Bakersfield team
thrashed the Cards, 42-10.
Friday's match against Santa Barbara was
marred by five forfeits. Jim Tatarakis (126)
defeated Santa Barbara's top wrestler, and was
named the outstanding competitor in the match
by Stanford coach Joe De Meo.
Saturday the Cards had little trouble with
Pomona, getting points from three forfeits, pins

by Mark Yancey (142) and Kris Westersund
(Hwt.) and decisions by Tatarakis and Charlie
Masch (150).
Against Bakersfield, however, Yancey's 13-2
decision and a default win by Roy Tolles (190)
were the lone bright spots for Stanford.
Mark Frelier's (177) loss was particularly
frustrating, as two of his opponent's points
were penalty points awarded by a questionable
referee's decision. The ref was relieved of his
duties after that match.
Stanford, now 8-10-1 on the season, has two
more chances to break the record. The Cards
travel to Berkeley Friday night for a match
against California and host Fresno State
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion.
