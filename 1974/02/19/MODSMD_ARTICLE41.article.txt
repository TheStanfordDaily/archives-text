# Streak Snapped By Huskies
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
SEATTLE — Stanford's Jeckyll
and Hyde basketball team
reverted to its dismal midseason
form last night, losing an 84-70
decision to Washington that
snapped the Cardinal winning
streak at five games.
The Cards connected on only
27 of 75 field goal attempts (36
percent) and turned the ball over
19 times. Meanwhile, the Huskies
blistered the nets for a .547
percentage.
Most of the damage was done
by guard Clarence Ramsey, who
scored 26 points, and forward
Ray Price, who added 23. Rich
Kelley led the Cards with 23
points.
"We have to shoot over 50
percent to win against a team like
Stanford because of their inside
ability," explained Washington
coach Marv Harshman. "I still feel
Stanford is a better basketball
team than us, but tonight things
just went our way."
Harshman would have had a
difficult time convincing 3900
fans at Edmundson Pavilion that
Stanford was better. The Huskies,
now 4-5 in the league and 13-8
overall, jumped out to an early
12-point advantage and
threatened to pull away until
Stanford scored 12 of the last 16
points in the first half, closing the
gap to 41-37 at halftime.
In the second half, however,
Stanford continued to turn the
ball over and miss layups, and the
Huskies gradually increased their
lead. "We were fortunate to get
out on top," said Harshman. "We
were fortunate we could play our
type of game."
The Cardinal zone, which was
so effective in last week's 88-68
victory over Washington and
Saturday night's 72-51 win over
Washington State, was unable to
contain the hot-shooting Huskies
last night. Price and Ramsey
burned the zone from outside,
while Larry Pounds contributed
16 points, most of them coming
on shorter shots in the gaps.
After the game, Harshman
insisted that the Cards are "still
better-suited than any team in the
conference to upset UCLA."
Stanford, now 4-5 in the league
and 10-10 overall in a confusing
season that includes a six-game
losing streak and a five-game
winning string, travels to Oregon
next weekend for games against
Bruin conquerors Oregon State
and Oregon.

streak at five games.
The Cards connected on only
27 of 75 field goal attempts (36
percent) and turned the ball over
19 times. Meanwhile, the Huskies
blistered the nets for a .547
percentage.
Most of the damage was done
by guard Clarence Ramsey, who
scored 26 points, and forward
Ray Price, who added 23. Rich
Kelley led the Cards with 23
points.
"We have to shoot over 50
percent to win against a team like
Stanford because of their inside
ability," explained Washington
coach Marv Harshman. "I still feel
Stanford is a better basketball
team than us, but tonight things
just went our way."
Harshman would have had a
difficult time convincing 3900
fans at Edmundson Pavilion that
Stanford was better. The Huskies,
now 4-5 in the league and 13-8
overall, jumped out to an early
12-point advantage and
threatened to pull away until
Stanford scored 12 of the last 16
points in the first half, closing the
gap to 41-37 at halftime.
In the second half, however,
Stanford continued to turn the
ball over and miss layups, and the
Huskies gradually increased their
lead. "We were fortunate to get
out on top," said Harshman. "We
were fortunate we could play our
type of game."
The Cardinal zone, which was
so effective in last week's 88-68
victory over Washington and
Saturday night's 72-51 win over
Washington State, was unable to
contain the hot-shooting Huskies
last night. Price and Ramsey
burned the zone from outside,
while Larry Pounds contributed
16 points, most of them coming
on shorter shots in the gaps.
After the game, Harshman
insisted that the Cards are "still
better-suited than any team in the
conference to upset UCLA."
Stanford, now 4-5 in the league
and 10-10 overall in a confusing
season that includes a six-game
losing streak and a five-game
winning string, travels to Oregon
next weekend for games against
Bruin conquerors Oregon State
and Oregon.
SEATTLE — Stanford's Jeckyll
and Hyde basketball team
reverted to its dismal midseason
form last night, losing an 84-70
decision to Washington that
