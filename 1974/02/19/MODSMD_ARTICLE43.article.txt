# Golfers Overwhelm Contrasting Opponents
## 
### 
Stanford's old guard couldn't
match its younger counterpart
Saturday, as the varsity golf team
defeated the alumni 19-8 on the
Stanford course. The victory
completed an easy weekend sweep
for the Cards, who thrashed
California 22 1 /2-4 1 /2 on Friday.
"It was an encouraging
weekend," said Conrad Nilmeier,
untroubled by putting woes that
accounted for a six-over-par 77
Saturday. (He shot 73 against
Cal.) "We have four players
playing consistently well, and the
other two guys just need a little
confidence."
Stanford's top four — Aly
Trompas, Dave Baskins, George
Pettinger and Nilmeier — are all
averaging between 71.8 and 73.8
for the first five matches. And

since only the top four scores are
counted in medal play
tournaments, the Cardinal
outlook is bright for the major
events this spring.
Friday, Pettinger and Nilmeier
each fired 73s while Trompas
shot 74 and Baskins added a 75.
Brent Murray and Tom Mason
contributed BV2 out of a possible
nine points, both firing 78s in
lopsided wins over Cal's Rocky
Golub (87) and Chris Nelle (85).
The victory was particularly
satisfying because it avenged
Stanford's only loss of the year, a
14 1 /2-12 1 /2 setback to the Bears at
Franklin Canyon Country Club in
the season opener three weeks
ago.
Saturday, the crafty alumni
provided a tougher test, but the
varsity prevailed on the strength
of one-stroke victories by Baskins
and Nilmeier. Baskins, who shot
41 on the front nine, rallied for a
one-under-par 34 on the back to
nip 1942 NCAA champion Sandy
Tatum, 75-76.
Nilmeier consistently outdrove
60-year-old Bob Roos by 30
yards, but still had to struggle for
a 77-78 victory.
In the other matches, Chuck
Van Linge fired a 73 to beat
Trompas, who three-putted the
last three greens and had to settle
for 74. Pettinger (74) beat Kent
Winton (78), while Bob Ireland
edged Murray, 74-76, and Mason
outlasted aging Grant Spaeth,
87-85.
Stanford is now 3-1 on the
season.

Stanford's only loss of the year, a
14 1 /2-12 1 /2 setback to the Bears at
Franklin Canyon Country Club in
the season opener three weeks
ago.
Saturday, the crafty alumni
provided a tougher test, but the
varsity prevailed on the strength
of one-stroke victories by Baskins
and Nilmeier. Baskins, who shot
41 on the front nine, rallied for a
one-under-par 34 on the back to
nip 1942 NCAA champion Sandy
Tatum, 75-76.
Nilmeier consistently outdrove
60-year-old Bob Roos by 30
yards, but still had to struggle for
a 77-78 victory.
In the other matches, Chuck
Van Linge fired a 73 to beat
Trompas, who three-putted the
last three greens and had to settle
for 74. Pettinger (74) beat Kent
Winton (78), while Bob Ireland
edged Murray, 74-76, and Mason
outlasted aging Grant Spaeth,
87-85.
Stanford is now 3-1 on the
season.
Stanford's old guard couldn't
match its younger counterpart
Saturday, as the varsity golf team
defeated the alumni 19-8 on the
Stanford course. The victory
completed an easy weekend sweep
for the Cards, who thrashed
California 22 1 /2-4 1 /2 on Friday.
"It was an encouraging
weekend," said Conrad Nilmeier,
untroubled by putting woes that
accounted for a six-over-par 77
Saturday. (He shot 73 against
Cal.) "We have four players
playing consistently well, and the
other two guys just need a little
confidence."
Stanford's top four — Aly
Trompas, Dave Baskins, George
Pettinger and Nilmeier — are all
averaging between 71.8 and 73.8
for the first five matches. And

since only the top four scores are
counted in medal play
tournaments, the Cardinal
outlook is bright for the major
events this spring.
Friday, Pettinger and Nilmeier
each fired 73s while Trompas
shot 74 and Baskins added a 75.
Brent Murray and Tom Mason
contributed BV2 out of a possible
nine points, both firing 78s in
lopsided wins over Cal's Rocky
Golub (87) and Chris Nelle (85).
The victory was particularly
satisfying because it avenged
