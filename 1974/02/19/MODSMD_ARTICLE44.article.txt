Mitchell, Stans Trial Begins
NEW YORK — Two original members of
President Nixon's Cabinet, John N. Mitchell and
Maurice H. Stans, go on trial here today, accused of
selling their influence for a secret $200,000
contribution to Nixon's re-election campaign.
Neither man was still in the Cabinet when the
alleged crime occurred in 1972. Mitchell had quit as
attorney general to take over operation of the
Committee to Re-elect the President. Former
Commerce Secretary Stans was the committee's
chief fund raiser.
Delayed three times since last September, partly
while both sides wrangled over availability of White
House tape recordings, jury selection may start
today unless there are last-minute pretrial motions
for U.S. District Court Judge Lee P. Gagliardi.
Mitchell and Stans are the first Cabinet men
indicted on criminal charges since the Teapot Dome
scandals of the 19205.
Solzhenitsyn To Continue Work
ZURICH, Switzerland — Alexander Solzhenitsyn
vowed yesterday to continue his work in exile and
said he has as much right to live on Russian soil as
those who had "the audacity to physically throw
me out."
In an exclusive interview with The Associated
Press, Solzhenitsyn said he did not know when his
family would join him or where he would settle. It
was his first interview since he was expelled from
the Soviet Union last Wednesday.
"But I do not think that it is hopeless," he said,
referring to his exile. "Even old trees — even they
are transplanted, and they take root in a new
place."
Meanwhile, ballet dancer Valery Panov was
warned yesterday to leave Moscow immediately for
Israel without his wife, or face "tough
administrative measures," his wife Galina said.
But the former star character dancer with
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet repeated his refusal to
abandon her, she said.
Panov, a Jew, was dismissed from the Kirov
troupe nearly two years ago when he informed the
directors he wanted to emigrate. He has been
deprived of work and the opportunity to dance
since the dismissal.
Last Dec. 18 the chief of the Leningrad passport
office told Panov he could go to Israel, but his
non-Jewish wife could not.
Democrat Wins Ford's House Seat
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat Richard F.
VanderVeen, a lawyer who had lost every previous
race for elective office, scored a major upset
yesterday by winning the congressional seat
occupied for 25 years by Vice President Gerald R.
Ford.
VanderVeen, 51, had called this election a
referendum on Watergate and President Nixon. He
took an early lead in the vote counting in Michigan's
sth Congressional District and went on to defeat
favored Republican Robert VanderLaan, the former
state Senate majority leader who ran with Ford's
blessing and support.
It will be the first time since 1910 that a
Democrat has occupied the seat.
With 262 of the district's 270 precincts reporting,
or 95 percent of the vote, VanderVeen had 50,877
votes to 44,659 for VanderLaan. Two minority
party candidates trailed badly.

VanderVeen, a Harvard-educated man, had
previously lost to Ford in 1958 and then lost races
for lieutenant governor and even mayor. During the
campaign, he called for Nixon's resignation and said
the only way the country would put Watergate
behind it was to put Ford in the White House.
Ford, who cast his absentee ballot from
Washington last week, has said he did not consider
his prestige to be on the line. In previous elections
Ford consistently obtained more than 60 percent of
the vote.
Cambodian Convoy Attacked
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Insurgents attacked
a 10-vessel convoy en route to Phnom Penh, blew
up an ammunition barge, killed one sailor and
wounded four others, the capital's port authorities
said yesterday.
In Saigon, informed sources said South
Vietnamese government forces have occupied a fifth
island in the Spratly chain, a South China Sea
archipelago claimed by Peking.
The Cambodian rebels jumped the convoy about
30 miles southeast of Phnom Penh on the Mekong
River, the capital's only major supply artery that
remains open.
The barge that blew up was carrying 700 tons of
ammunition, the port authorities said. Another
barge caught fire, but the blaze was put out.
The ambush was the first major attack on the
shipping lane during the current dry season.
Arabs, Kissinger Make Progress
WASHINGTON — Two Arab foreign ministers
and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger made
some progress yesterday on bringing Syria into the
Middle East peace talks and lifting the oil embargo
against the United States.
The ministers, Ismail Fahmy of Egypt and Omar
Sakkaf of Saudi Arabia, will call today on President
Nixon at the White House. Fahmy told newspersons
he would be bringing "good news."
"There is progress on every avenue," the
Egyptian said after an hour's talk with Kissinger in
the secretary's office and lunch at the State
Department. But he declined to provide specifics.
Kissinger, meanwhile, said there had been some
"solid accomplishments."
Milk Producers Deny 'Transfer'
SAN ANTONIO, Tex. — Associated Milk
Producers Inc. denied yesterday any previous
understanding that $200,000 in campaign
contributions were to be transferred in 1972 from
Republican congressional committees to President
Nixon's campaign funds.
"We do not now have knowledge that such
transfer may have occurred," said Dr. George
Mehren, general manager of the cooperative. "If
they did occur, transfers were in direct
contravention of the explicit terms of letters
transmitting the contributions" to the congressional
committees.
Mehren was replying to reports last week that
$200,000 in money contributed by milk producers
to Republican congressional committees had been
diverted to the Nixon re-election committee.
Meany Predicts Recession
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - AFL-CIO President
George Meany said yesterday the economy is going

into a recession despite administration claims to the
contrary. He predicted unemployment will top six
percent this year.
Me any also made clear that the
14-million-member labor federation would continue
to push for President Nixon's impeachment despite
what he said was the administration charge that the
AFL-CIO was trying to drag out Watergate for
political purposes.
"Blaming us for the President's troubles is
ridiculous," he said. "The President could have
ended Watergate last May if he just came out and
told the whole truth."
Meany fielded a wide range of questions at a news
conference after the opening of the AFL-CIO
executive council's midwinter conference.
UFW Stages One-Day Walkout
CALEXICO — Cesar Chavez aimed a one-day
walkout yesterday at Imperial County lettuce fields
in an effort to wrest union control back from the
Teamsters. He said his United Farm Workers of
America is "prepared to do what it takes."
Meanwhile, several hundred men and women
clashed with California highway patrolmen and
sheriffs deputies trying to stop disruption in fields,
and 16 persons were arrested, a sheriff's spokesman
said.
Chavez said 7000 farm workers boycotted work,
but sheriffs officers said those in protest groups and
an afternoon rally may have numbered 500.
Nixon Attends Southern Rally
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — President Nixon flew into
the heart of Dixie yesterday and said he found "the
heart of America is good, the character of America
is strong."
Joining Alabama Gov. George Wallace and two
other Southern governors in an Honor America
rally, Nixon told a crowd estimated by sponsors at
40,000 that "we're going to continue to be a great
nation."
Nixon said he was heartened by the reception
because "it reminds all of America that here in the
heart of Dixie we find the heart of America is
good ..."
The President made no direct reference to the
Watergate scandal or its impact on his presidency.
But he had pointed words about the Washington
news media.
He said that there "sometimes is a tendency in
reporting of news .. . that bad news is news and
good news is not news."
Because of this, he said, "many get a distorted
view of what is America and what it is really
like ..
Chopper Thief Returns
WASHINGTON — The Army private who flew a
stolen helicopter onto the White House lawn
Sunday was returned to the Walter Reed Army
Hospital's psychiatric center yesterday after federal

military regulations, including the charge of theft of
government property.

Mitchell, Stans Trial Begins
NEW YORK — Two original members of
President Nixon's Cabinet, John N. Mitchell and
Maurice H. Stans, go on trial here today, accused of
selling their influence for a secret $200,000
contribution to Nixon's re-election campaign.
Neither man was still in the Cabinet when the
alleged crime occurred in 1972. Mitchell had quit as
attorney general to take over operation of the
Committee to Re-elect the President. Former
Commerce Secretary Stans was the committee's
chief fund raiser.
Delayed three times since last September, partly
while both sides wrangled over availability of White
House tape recordings, jury selection may start
today unless there are last-minute pretrial motions
for U.S. District Court Judge Lee P. Gagliardi.
Mitchell and Stans are the first Cabinet men
indicted on criminal charges since the Teapot Dome
scandals of the 19205.
Solzhenitsyn To Continue Work
ZURICH, Switzerland — Alexander Solzhenitsyn
vowed yesterday to continue his work in exile and
said he has as much right to live on Russian soil as
those who had "the audacity to physically throw
me out."
In an exclusive interview with The Associated
Press, Solzhenitsyn said he did not know when his
family would join him or where he would settle. It
was his first interview since he was expelled from
the Soviet Union last Wednesday.
"But I do not think that it is hopeless," he said,
referring to his exile. "Even old trees — even they
are transplanted, and they take root in a new
place."
Meanwhile, ballet dancer Valery Panov was
warned yesterday to leave Moscow immediately for
Israel without his wife, or face "tough
administrative measures," his wife Galina said.
But the former star character dancer with
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet repeated his refusal to
abandon her, she said.
Panov, a Jew, was dismissed from the Kirov
troupe nearly two years ago when he informed the
directors he wanted to emigrate. He has been
deprived of work and the opportunity to dance
since the dismissal.
Last Dec. 18 the chief of the Leningrad passport
office told Panov he could go to Israel, but his
non-Jewish wife could not.
Democrat Wins Ford's House Seat
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat Richard F.
VanderVeen, a lawyer who had lost every previous
race for elective office, scored a major upset
yesterday by winning the congressional seat
occupied for 25 years by Vice President Gerald R.
Ford.
VanderVeen, 51, had called this election a
referendum on Watergate and President Nixon. He
took an early lead in the vote counting in Michigan's
sth Congressional District and went on to defeat
favored Republican Robert VanderLaan, the former
state Senate majority leader who ran with Ford's
blessing and support.
It will be the first time since 1910 that a
Democrat has occupied the seat.
With 262 of the district's 270 precincts reporting,
or 95 percent of the vote, VanderVeen had 50,877
votes to 44,659 for VanderLaan. Two minority
party candidates trailed badly.

VanderVeen, a Harvard-educated man, had
previously lost to Ford in 1958 and then lost races
for lieutenant governor and even mayor. During the
campaign, he called for Nixon's resignation and said
the only way the country would put Watergate
behind it was to put Ford in the White House.
Ford, who cast his absentee ballot from
Washington last week, has said he did not consider
his prestige to be on the line. In previous elections
Ford consistently obtained more than 60 percent of
the vote.

With 262 of the district's 270 precincts reporting,

VanderVeen, a Harvard-educated man, had
previously lost to Ford in 1958 and then lost races
for lieutenant governor and even mayor. During the
campaign, he called for Nixon's resignation and said
the only way the country would put Watergate
behind it was to put Ford in the White House.
Ford, who cast his absentee ballot from
Washington last week, has said he did not consider
his prestige to be on the line. In previous elections
Ford consistently obtained more than 60 percent of
the vote.

SAN ANTONIO, Tex. — Associated Milk

Republican congressional committees to President
Nixon's campaign funds.
"We do not now have knowledge that such

to Republican congressional committees had been
diverted to the Nixon re-election committee.

ridiculous," he said. "The President could have

because "it reminds all of America that here in the
heart of Dixie we find the heart of America is
good ..."
The President made no direct reference to the
Watergate scandal or its impact on his presidency.
But he had pointed words about the Washington
news media.

Mitchell, Stans Trial Begins
NEW YORK — Two original members of
President Nixon's Cabinet, John N. Mitchell and
Maurice H. Stans, go on trial here today, accused of
selling their influence for a secret $200,000
contribution to Nixon's re-election campaign.
Neither man was still in the Cabinet when the
alleged crime occurred in 1972. Mitchell had quit as
attorney general to take over operation of the
Committee to Re-elect the President. Former
Commerce Secretary Stans was the committee's
chief fund raiser.
Delayed three times since last September, partly
while both sides wrangled over availability of White
House tape recordings, jury selection may start
today unless there are last-minute pretrial motions
for U.S. District Court Judge Lee P. Gagliardi.
Mitchell and Stans are the first Cabinet men
indicted on criminal charges since the Teapot Dome
scandals of the 19205.
Solzhenitsyn To Continue Work
ZURICH, Switzerland — Alexander Solzhenitsyn
vowed yesterday to continue his work in exile and
said he has as much right to live on Russian soil as
those who had "the audacity to physically throw
me out."
In an exclusive interview with The Associated
Press, Solzhenitsyn said he did not know when his
family would join him or where he would settle. It
was his first interview since he was expelled from
the Soviet Union last Wednesday.
"But I do not think that it is hopeless," he said,
referring to his exile. "Even old trees — even they
are transplanted, and they take root in a new
place."
Meanwhile, ballet dancer Valery Panov was
warned yesterday to leave Moscow immediately for
Israel without his wife, or face "tough
administrative measures," his wife Galina said.
But the former star character dancer with
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet repeated his refusal to
abandon her, she said.
Panov, a Jew, was dismissed from the Kirov
troupe nearly two years ago when he informed the
directors he wanted to emigrate. He has been
deprived of work and the opportunity to dance
since the dismissal.
Last Dec. 18 the chief of the Leningrad passport
office told Panov he could go to Israel, but his
non-Jewish wife could not.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat Richard F.
VanderVeen, a lawyer who had lost every previous

yesterday by winning the congressional seat
occupied for 25 years by Vice President Gerald R.

Mitchell, Stans Trial Begins
NEW YORK — Two original members of
President Nixon's Cabinet, John N. Mitchell and
Maurice H. Stans, go on trial here today, accused of
selling their influence for a secret $200,000
contribution to Nixon's re-election campaign.
Neither man was still in the Cabinet when the
alleged crime occurred in 1972. Mitchell had quit as
attorney general to take over operation of the
Committee to Re-elect the President. Former
Commerce Secretary Stans was the committee's
chief fund raiser.
Delayed three times since last September, partly
while both sides wrangled over availability of White
House tape recordings, jury selection may start
today unless there are last-minute pretrial motions
for U.S. District Court Judge Lee P. Gagliardi.
Mitchell and Stans are the first Cabinet men
indicted on criminal charges since the Teapot Dome
scandals of the 19205.
Solzhenitsyn To Continue Work
ZURICH, Switzerland — Alexander Solzhenitsyn
vowed yesterday to continue his work in exile and
said he has as much right to live on Russian soil as
those who had "the audacity to physically throw
me out."
In an exclusive interview with The Associated
Press, Solzhenitsyn said he did not know when his
family would join him or where he would settle. It
was his first interview since he was expelled from
the Soviet Union last Wednesday.
"But I do not think that it is hopeless," he said,
referring to his exile. "Even old trees — even they
are transplanted, and they take root in a new
place."
Meanwhile, ballet dancer Valery Panov was
warned yesterday to leave Moscow immediately for
Israel without his wife, or face "tough
administrative measures," his wife Galina said.
But the former star character dancer with
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet repeated his refusal to
abandon her, she said.
Panov, a Jew, was dismissed from the Kirov
troupe nearly two years ago when he informed the
directors he wanted to emigrate. He has been
deprived of work and the opportunity to dance
since the dismissal.
Last Dec. 18 the chief of the Leningrad passport
office told Panov he could go to Israel, but his
non-Jewish wife could not.
Democrat Wins Ford's House Seat
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat Richard F.
VanderVeen, a lawyer who had lost every previous
race for elective office, scored a major upset
yesterday by winning the congressional seat
occupied for 25 years by Vice President Gerald R.
Ford.
VanderVeen, 51, had called this election a
referendum on Watergate and President Nixon. He
took an early lead in the vote counting in Michigan's
sth Congressional District and went on to defeat
favored Republican Robert VanderLaan, the former
state Senate majority leader who ran with Ford's
blessing and support.
It will be the first time since 1910 that a
Democrat has occupied the seat.
With 262 of the district's 270 precincts reporting,
or 95 percent of the vote, VanderVeen had 50,877
votes to 44,659 for VanderLaan. Two minority
party candidates trailed badly.

VanderVeen, a Harvard-educated man, had
previously lost to Ford in 1958 and then lost races
for lieutenant governor and even mayor. During the
campaign, he called for Nixon's resignation and said
the only way the country would put Watergate
behind it was to put Ford in the White House.
Ford, who cast his absentee ballot from
Washington last week, has said he did not consider
his prestige to be on the line. In previous elections
Ford consistently obtained more than 60 percent of
the vote.
Cambodian Convoy Attacked
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Insurgents attacked
a 10-vessel convoy en route to Phnom Penh, blew
up an ammunition barge, killed one sailor and

said yesterday.
In Saigon, informed sources said South
Vietnamese government forces have occupied a fifth
island in the Spratly chain, a South China Sea
archipelago claimed by Peking.
The Cambodian rebels jumped the convoy about
30 miles southeast of Phnom Penh on the Mekong
River, the capital's only major supply artery that

The ambush was the first major attack on the

Nixon at the White House. Fahmy told newspersons

Department. But he declined to provide specifics.
Kissinger, meanwhile, said there had been some

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - AFL-CIO President
George Meany said yesterday the economy is going

into a recession despite administration claims to the
contrary. He predicted unemployment will top six

14-million-member labor federation would continue
to push for President Nixon's impeachment despite
what he said was the administration charge that the
AFL-CIO was trying to drag out Watergate for
political purposes.
"Blaming us for the President's troubles is
ridiculous," he said. "The President could have
ended Watergate last May if he just came out and
told the whole truth."
Meany fielded a wide range of questions at a news
conference after the opening of the AFL-CIO

40,000 that "we're going to continue to be a great
nation."
Nixon said he was heartened by the reception
because "it reminds all of America that here in the
heart of Dixie we find the heart of America is
good ..."
The President made no direct reference to the
Watergate scandal or its impact on his presidency.
But he had pointed words about the Washington
news media.
He said that there "sometimes is a tendency in
reporting of news .. . that bad news is news and
good news is not news."
Because of this, he said, "many get a distorted
view of what is America and what it is really
like ..

Meany Predicts Recession
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - AFL-CIO President
George Meany said yesterday the economy is going

into a recession despite administration claims to the
contrary. He predicted unemployment will top six
percent this year.
Me any also made clear that the
14-million-member labor federation would continue
to push for President Nixon's impeachment despite
what he said was the administration charge that the
AFL-CIO was trying to drag out Watergate for
political purposes.
"Blaming us for the President's troubles is

ended Watergate last May if he just came out and
told the whole truth."
Meany fielded a wide range of questions at a news
conference after the opening of the AFL-CIO
executive council's midwinter conference.
