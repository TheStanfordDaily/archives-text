# Ombudsman Named
## 
### DON COX 
The School of Engineering
announced last week the appointment
of Civil Engineering Prof. James Gere
to the newly established post of
departmental ombudsman.
Robert Eustis, associate dean of
the School of Engineering, said that a
departmental ombudsman had been
named since "we were concerned that
some students might be reluctant to go
to Harvey Hall, the University
ombudsman, for what they consider to
be minor problems."
"We're not doing this because we're
unhappy with Harvey Hall, but to
make it easier to handle the non-major
complaints," Eustis added.
The proposal for a departmental
ombudsman had originated in the
school of engineering's undergraduate
council about a month ago. Eustis
said, adding that he was not aware of
any other departments considering the
establishment of a similar post.
Eustis said that Gere had been
picked by the engineering department
deans because "he is an active

undergraduate prof who knows
engineering, is liked by students and is
easily approached."
Gere will hear out students'
problems and will "take the action
necessary to make sure the situation is
cleared," said Eustis.
Hall, consulted by Eustis about the
engineering ombudsman post, told the
Daily yesterday afternoon that he
thought the post was a "fine idea."
"A faculty member will be able to
be of more help to people in the
School of Engineering who have
academic grievances than I would,"
Hall said.
"However, in all-University matters,
I feel I could be of more help," he
added.
Hall said he expected reciprocal
referrals among the ombudsman
offices and saw "no reason why we all
can't work together."
Hall said that a departmental
ombudsman was a good idea
"particularly in professional schools
where relations with the University
ombudsman are, at best, tangential."

IS MONDALE THE MAN? — Sen. Walter Mondale, D-Minn., said Friday in Palo
Alto that the U.S. needs a strong President who is also open and legal. Mondale
apparently thinks he fits that description as he is currently testing public
receptivity to his possible candidacy in 1976.
