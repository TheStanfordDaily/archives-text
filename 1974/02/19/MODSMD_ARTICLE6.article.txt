# Shockley Debate At Yale Cancelled
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
A scheduled debate at Yale University between Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley and Roy Innis, executive director of the Congress of Racial
Equality (CORE), was cancelled Friday night when the membership of the Yale
Political Union voted to rescind the invitations issued by its executive
committee.
The cancellation marks the third time in the last few months that scheduled
public debates between Shockley and Innis have failed to take place.
Last fall, Harvard University cancelled a debate between these two spokesmen
after numerous protests from the Black Law Students Association. And on Dec.
4, an attempt to arrange a debate at Princeton University failed when Innis
refused to appear because the conditions of the debate were unsatisfactory to
him. On that occasion, Shockley went on to present his case without
disturbance.
According to Shockley, the two did debate on television in late December on
NBC's "Tomorrow" show.
The Yale Political Union, which has a voting membership of 820 according to
its president Fred Krupp, chose to cancel the debate by a vote of 200 to 190.
The debate had been tentatively scheduled for March 7.
Krupp, who told the Daily he personally "voted in favor of having the
debate," explained that the turnout of 390 voters was significant despite the fact
that it represents less than half of the Union membership. "That's more people
than have ever voted on any Union matter in the history of the Union," Krupp
said.

According to Krupp, the Union's
Executive Board, which consists of
nine voting members, voted six to
three in January to send invitations to
both Shockley and Innis.
Meanwhile, an Associated Press
article appearing in yesterday's San
Francisco Examiner reported, "Lux et
Veritas, another campus group, has
decided to invite Shockley and Innis
to debate [in] March, executive
director Thomas E. Spahn said."
John O'Connor, news editor of the
Yale Daily News, described Lux et
Veritas as "a rather conservative group
funded by certain alumni. It has
minimal student support."
The AP report prompted a response
from the Yale Corporation, the
University's governing body, and from
Yale President Kingman Brewster Jr.
The statement released by the
Corporation yesterday, which first
praised members of the Political Union
for facing a "difficult decision," said,
"Now it is reported that a student
organization affiliated with an
unofficial group of alumni, Lux et
Veritas Inc., has invited the speakers.
Provocation
"This is apparently done in order to
test whether Yale's beliefs in free
speech can stand up against such
provocation," the statement asserted.
"The entire community is being used."
However, the Corporation stated,
"We do not intend to abandon our
principles by seeking to forbid the
debate if the speakers are invited and
should accept."
Brewster agreed with the
Corporation in his statement, also
released yesterday, saying "the
occasion does not warrant departures
from Yale's principles of free speech."
Brewster suggested that "the best
way to avoid playing into the hands of
the sponsors, the best way to avoid
amplifying Dr. Shockley's views, the
best way to show one's scorn and
distaste for this provocation is to leave
the speakers to an audience of their
sponsors.
"Any other course," Brewster
concluded, "whether by official
suppression or by violent protest,
would only dignify the occasion and
magnify Dr. Shockley's views by
appearing to be afraid of his
presence."
Lux et Veritas denied that it had
made any plans to reschedule the
debate. "Neither President Brewster
nor the Corporation contacted us
before condemning our intention,"
charged a statement issued by Spahn.
"If either had called us, they would
have realized that no invitations to
Shockley or Innis have been sent."
The conservative group did say,
however, that after the cancellation of
the debate, "Lux et Veritas began to
explore the possibility of inviting the
two men
New Challenge
Shockley immediate criticized the
statements by Brewster and the Yale
Corporation, and challenged "the
presidents of Dartmouth, Princeton
and Yale, who have derogated my
views, to public debate with me on
these moral issues and their logical
bases."
In a statement issued by Shockley
yesterday, he said, "The Yale Political
Union has helped to make one of my
main points by cancelling its invitation
to me to debate Mr. Roy Innis of
CORE under its auspices. My point is
that Universities do not encourage
belief in the power of inquiry to find
truth."
Although Innis could not be
reached for comment, his assistant at
CORE told the Daily, "He's very much
interested in debating" and has tried
to arrange the debate a number of
times.
"We're just sorry that academia isn't
ready to accept the concept of
academic freedom," she said.

have realized that no invitations to
Shockley or Innis have been sent."
The conservative group did say,
however, that after the cancellation of
the debate, "Lux et Veritas began to

New Challenge
Shockley immediate criticized the
statements by Brewster and the Yale
Corporation, and challenged "the
presidents of Dartmouth, Princeton
and Yale, who have derogated my
views, to public debate with me on
these moral issues and their logical
bases."
In a statement issued by Shockley
yesterday, he said, "The Yale Political
Union has helped to make one of my
main points by cancelling its invitation
to me to debate Mr. Roy Innis of
CORE under its auspices. My point is
that Universities do not encourage
belief in the power of inquiry to find
truth."
Although Innis could not be
reached for comment, his assistant at
CORE told the Daily, "He's very much
interested in debating" and has tried
to arrange the debate a number of
times.
"We're just sorry that academia isn't
ready to accept the concept of
academic freedom," she said.
A scheduled debate at Yale University between Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley and Roy Innis, executive director of the Congress of Racial
Equality (CORE), was cancelled Friday night when the membership of the Yale
Political Union voted to rescind the invitations issued by its executive
committee.
The cancellation marks the third time in the last few months that scheduled
public debates between Shockley and Innis have failed to take place.
Last fall, Harvard University cancelled a debate between these two spokesmen
after numerous protests from the Black Law Students Association. And on Dec.
4, an attempt to arrange a debate at Princeton University failed when Innis
refused to appear because the conditions of the debate were unsatisfactory to
him. On that occasion, Shockley went on to present his case without
disturbance.
According to Shockley, the two did debate on television in late December on
NBC's "Tomorrow" show.
The Yale Political Union, which has a voting membership of 820 according to
its president Fred Krupp, chose to cancel the debate by a vote of 200 to 190.
The debate had been tentatively scheduled for March 7.
Krupp, who told the Daily he personally "voted in favor of having the
debate," explained that the turnout of 390 voters was significant despite the fact
that it represents less than half of the Union membership. "That's more people
than have ever voted on any Union matter in the history of the Union," Krupp
said.

According to Krupp, the Union's
Executive Board, which consists of
nine voting members, voted six to
three in January to send invitations to
both Shockley and Innis.
Meanwhile, an Associated Press
article appearing in yesterday's San
Francisco Examiner reported, "Lux et
Veritas, another campus group, has
decided to invite Shockley and Innis
to debate [in] March, executive
director Thomas E. Spahn said."
John O'Connor, news editor of the
Yale Daily News, described Lux et
Veritas as "a rather conservative group
funded by certain alumni. It has
minimal student support."
The AP report prompted a response
from the Yale Corporation, the
University's governing body, and from
Yale President Kingman Brewster Jr.
The statement released by the
Corporation yesterday, which first
praised members of the Political Union
for facing a "difficult decision," said,
"Now it is reported that a student
organization affiliated with an
unofficial group of alumni, Lux et
Veritas Inc., has invited the speakers.
Provocation
"This is apparently done in order to
test whether Yale's beliefs in free
speech can stand up against such
provocation," the statement asserted.
"The entire community is being used."
However, the Corporation stated,
"We do not intend to abandon our
principles by seeking to forbid the
debate if the speakers are invited and
should accept."
Brewster agreed with the
Corporation in his statement, also
released yesterday, saying "the
occasion does not warrant departures
from Yale's principles of free speech."
Brewster suggested that "the best
way to avoid playing into the hands of
the sponsors, the best way to avoid
amplifying Dr. Shockley's views, the
best way to show one's scorn and
distaste for this provocation is to leave
the speakers to an audience of their
sponsors.
"Any other course," Brewster
concluded, "whether by official
suppression or by violent protest,
would only dignify the occasion and
magnify Dr. Shockley's views by
appearing to be afraid of his
presence."
Lux et Veritas denied that it had
made any plans to reschedule the
debate. "Neither President Brewster
nor the Corporation contacted us
before condemning our intention,"
charged a statement issued by Spahn.
"If either had called us, they would
have realized that no invitations to
Shockley or Innis have been sent."

provocation," the statement asserted.
"The entire community is being used."
However, the Corporation stated,
"We do not intend to abandon our
principles by seeking to forbid the
debate if the speakers are invited and
should accept."
Brewster agreed with the
Corporation in his statement, also
released yesterday, saying "the
occasion does not warrant departures
from Yale's principles of free speech."
Brewster suggested that "the best
way to avoid playing into the hands of
the sponsors, the best way to avoid
amplifying Dr. Shockley's views, the
best way to show one's scorn and
distaste for this provocation is to leave
the speakers to an audience of their
sponsors.
"Any other course," Brewster
concluded, "whether by official
suppression or by violent protest,
would only dignify the occasion and
magnify Dr. Shockley's views by
appearing to be afraid of his
presence."
Lux et Veritas denied that it had
made any plans to reschedule the
debate. "Neither President Brewster
nor the Corporation contacted us
before condemning our intention,"
charged a statement issued by Spahn.
"If either had called us, they would
have realized that no invitations to
Shockley or Innis have been sent."
The conservative group did say,
however, that after the cancellation of
the debate, "Lux et Veritas began to
explore the possibility of inviting the
two men
New Challenge
Shockley immediate criticized the
statements by Brewster and the Yale
Corporation, and challenged "the
presidents of Dartmouth, Princeton
and Yale, who have derogated my
views, to public debate with me on
these moral issues and their logical
bases."
In a statement issued by Shockley
yesterday, he said, "The Yale Political
Union has helped to make one of my
main points by cancelling its invitation
to me to debate Mr. Roy Innis of
CORE under its auspices. My point is
that Universities do not encourage
belief in the power of inquiry to find
truth."
Although Innis could not be
reached for comment, his assistant at
CORE told the Daily, "He's very much
interested in debating" and has tried
to arrange the debate a number of
times.
"We're just sorry that academia isn't
ready to accept the concept of
academic freedom," she said.
A scheduled debate at Yale University between Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley and Roy Innis, executive director of the Congress of Racial
Equality (CORE), was cancelled Friday night when the membership of the Yale
Political Union voted to rescind the invitations issued by its executive
committee.
The cancellation marks the third time in the last few months that scheduled
public debates between Shockley and Innis have failed to take place.
Last fall, Harvard University cancelled a debate between these two spokesmen
after numerous protests from the Black Law Students Association. And on Dec.
4, an attempt to arrange a debate at Princeton University failed when Innis
refused to appear because the conditions of the debate were unsatisfactory to
him. On that occasion, Shockley went on to present his case without
disturbance.
According to Shockley, the two did debate on television in late December on
NBC's "Tomorrow" show.
The Yale Political Union, which has a voting membership of 820 according to
its president Fred Krupp, chose to cancel the debate by a vote of 200 to 190.
The debate had been tentatively scheduled for March 7.
Krupp, who told the Daily he personally "voted in favor of having the
debate," explained that the turnout of 390 voters was significant despite the fact
that it represents less than half of the Union membership. "That's more people
than have ever voted on any Union matter in the history of the Union," Krupp
said.

According to Krupp, the Union's
Executive Board, which consists of
nine voting members, voted six to
three in January to send invitations to
both Shockley and Innis.
Meanwhile, an Associated Press
article appearing in yesterday's San
Francisco Examiner reported, "Lux et
Veritas, another campus group, has
decided to invite Shockley and Innis
to debate [in] March, executive
director Thomas E. Spahn said."
John O'Connor, news editor of the
Yale Daily News, described Lux et
Veritas as "a rather conservative group
funded by certain alumni. It has
minimal student support."
The AP report prompted a response
from the Yale Corporation, the
University's governing body, and from
Yale President Kingman Brewster Jr.
The statement released by the
Corporation yesterday, which first
praised members of the Political Union
for facing a "difficult decision," said,
"Now it is reported that a student
organization affiliated with an
unofficial group of alumni, Lux et
Veritas Inc., has invited the speakers.
Provocation
"This is apparently done in order to
test whether Yale's beliefs in free
speech can stand up against such
provocation," the statement asserted.
"The entire community is being used."
However, the Corporation stated,
"We do not intend to abandon our
principles by seeking to forbid the
debate if the speakers are invited and
should accept."
