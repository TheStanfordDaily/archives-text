Rodin Gift
Editor:
Your coverage of the Cantor
donation of Rodin sculptures and
the gracious editorial that
followed were heartening to all of
us in the Art Department.
"The many others who helped
arrange the donation," whom you
thanked in the editorial, deserve
to be named.
Mr. Cantor was greatly
impressed by the research of our
art history graduate students,
Steve McGough, Steve Wander,
Dan Rosenfeld, and especially Dr.
Kirk Varnedoe, whose
distinguished study of Rodin
drawings and their forgeries
culminated in an important book
and exhibition.
During his visit to the campus
last spring, Cantor received a
warm welcome from the
undergraduate art history majors
and many of the Art 1 class that
made him feel Stanford students
really wanted his collection.
The museum staff, headed by
Lorenz Eitner, Francoise
Forster, Anita Mozely and Lee
Morgan gave Cantor assurance of
the professional treatment his
sculptures would receive.
To those who are concerned as
to whether their University's
administration and trustees are
living up to their promise of
strengthening art at Stanford,
their steady support and
successful negotiations should be
reassuring. The Committee for Art
went all out in hosting the
opening of the "Rodin and
Balzac" show and in explaining to
Cantor the public importance of
his proposed gift. What a joy to
know that Rodin can be part of
this community forever.

Referendum Ballots
Editor:
In a letter to the editor printed
in the Feb. 13 issue of the Daily,
Reuben Huerta raised several
questions concerning the confused
wording which appeared on some
ballots used in the recent ASSU
referendum.
In response to his first
question, Rick Haskell, the ASSU
elections commissioner, was
responsible for the objectionable
wording. Fortunately, Jim Friend
noticed the problem and had new
ballots printed and delivered to
polling booths within a couple
hours of the start of voting.
As to the question of the
referendum's validity, I think it is
probable that the confusing
ballots initially in use altered the
final tally by 40 or 50 votes.
However, this in no way detracts
from the true "validity" of the
referendum which lies in the fact
that an amazing 2600 people
took the time to vote.

Self-Righteous 'Daily'
Editor:
Undoubtedly, Doyle McManus
considers himself one of the
"chosen few" who somehow has
been granted sanction to scribble
verbose garbage on the Opinions
Page.
His article "Lies, Damn Lies
and Statistics" is but one example
of "the irresponsible and
degenerating course" of the Daily
referred to in Jeanne Keller's
letter (Feb. 15). Doubtless, a case
could be made for inexperienced
college students aspiring to be
influential members of the
"fourth branch" of our
government. However, one need
not be a camel having managed to
squeeze through the eye of
Stanford's needle in order to
distinguish covert forms of
irresponsibility.

Furthermore, anyone at all
familiar with the atmosphere of
the Daily office knows the extent
to which it condones and fosters
such low level cynicism. As a
former Daily staffer, I can testify
to the self-righteous attitude used
to justify "cleverness" under the
auspices of objective criticism.
And thank God for Dean
Hargadon's rebuttal. I especially
appreciated his words "that all of
us would do well to adopt a
more humble perspective about
the University, its students and
the admissions process." One
hears the denunciation of the
"Ivory Tower" reiterated time
and time again. While this theme
can be overdramatized, its
lingering trap is all too easy to fall
into.
In that Mark Twain is our
recurrent source of
enlightenment, it might be useful
for all of us to heed to his advice
that "In truth, man is incurably
foolish. Simple things other
animals easily learn, he is
incapable of learning."
Perhaps those on the Daily
staff would serve themselves and
their community better if they
would learn to make simple
judgments of responsible
journalism.

Solzhenitsyn At Stanford
Editor:
I have profound admiration
not only for Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's published works
but also for the courage of his pen
and for his personal behavior in
momentarily bringing down a
machine manned by some of the
most talented oppressors in the
history of civilization.
However, it is difficult to
escape the bit of irony of his now
being importuned by the same
institution which managed to
distinguish itself internationally
by sacking another writer for,
admittedly, a somewhat more
abrasive approach to an old
problem.

Murphy's Honeys
Editor:
On Feb. 13 the Daily printed
an article stating that Bob Murphy
had made an effort to correct the
mistaken belief of an ABC man,
Andy Sidaris, that there are no
"honeys" at Stanford, by sending
him pictures of beautiful women
spectators.
We don't want or need
Murphy's defense. We are not
concerned with whether or not
there is a shortage of beautiful
women at Stanford, nor whether
Andy Sidaris thinks there is.
Stanford women are not objects,
like the old Spanish-style
buildings, designed to make the
University more attractive.
It's bad enough that Mr. Sidaris
can only see women as alluring
spectators, but does he have to
contribute to these archaic
attitudes? As sports information
director, his time would be better
spent covering women's athletics,
which deserve as much notice as
men's.
The Stanford Daily must also
take some blame for perpetuating
this perception of women. The
way the article appeared, specially
boxed, and with a caption
"Honey Shortages?" that endorses
that connotation of honey, shows
that even our supposedly
'enlightened oracles' still support
this unrealistic view of women.
However, we are not surprised in
light of the Daily's general
treatment of women's news.
