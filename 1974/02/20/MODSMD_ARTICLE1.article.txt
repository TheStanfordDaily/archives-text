# 'GOP Can Win Stale Offices'
## Candidate Expresses Optimism 
### BILL ROSS 
Watergate will deprive the
Republican Party of votes in California
this year, but the GOP still has a good
chance of winning many offices, John
Veneman, candidate for the
Republican nomination for lieutenant
governor told a group of 15 Stanford
students last night.
"I have confidence that the voters
will be able to distinguish beween the
Republicans involved in Watergate and
those who were working in
government who were not involved,"
Veneman said.
Addressing the Stanford chapter of
the California Young Republican
League, Veneman noted that he served
for four years under Nixon as under
secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare [HEW|, but "knew nothing
more (about Watergate) than any of
you."
Predicting that the Democrats will
emphasize the scandals in the
upcoming campaign, Veneman stated,
"Any of us who would guess that
Watergate won't have an impact is
living in a dream world."
Veneman stressed the need for the
Republican voters to select candidates
with clean records. "Any candidate
tainted by scandal is in trouble," he

remarked.
Defending his years as under
secretary of HEW, Veneman cited his
accomplishments in welfare reform,
the extension of health services and
the promotion of revenue sharing as
evidence of his progressive record.
Veneman stated that he favors the
decentralization of government social
welfare programs.
But this means that local
governments will have to stop being
provincial, he noted. They must start
considering the regional implications
of problems if they are to efficiently
manage programs previously operated
by the federal government.
As lieutenant governor, Veneman
said he would be able to utilize the
experience gained at HEW. Also, he
would be able to promote harmony
between the executive and legislative
branches of government, having served
from 1962 until 1968 in the state
assembly.
Veneman said that he opposed
Proposition 1, the referendum
supported by Gov. Reagan in the
election last November. While he
agreed with its objective of curbing
government spending, he did not
believe that such a measure should
become part of the state's

constitution. Such a measure would
have destroyed the flexibility of state
officials in dealing with taxation, he
explained.
Although he hopes to raise

$435,000 with which to fight the
primary campaign, Veneman insisted
that this amount is not excessive. He
pointed out that there are 3.7 million
