# 'GOP Can Win Stale Offices'
## Candidate Expresses Optimism 
### BILL ROSS 
Watergate will deprive the
Republican Party of votes in California
this year, but the GOP still has a good
chance of winning many offices, John
Veneman, candidate for the
Republican nomination for lieutenant
governor told a group of 15 Stanford
students last night.
"I have confidence that the voters
will be able to distinguish beween the
Republicans involved in Watergate and
those who were working in
government who were not involved,"
Veneman said.
Addressing the Stanford chapter of
the California Young Republican
League, Veneman noted that he served
for four years under Nixon as under
secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare [HEW|, but "knew nothing
more (about Watergate) than any of
you."
Predicting that the Democrats will
emphasize the scandals in the
upcoming campaign, Veneman stated,
"Any of us who would guess that
Watergate won't have an impact is
living in a dream world."
Veneman stressed the need for the
Republican voters to select candidates
with clean records. "Any candidate
tainted by scandal is in trouble," he

remarked.
Defending his years as under
secretary of HEW, Veneman cited his
accomplishments in welfare reform,
the extension of health services and
the promotion of revenue sharing as
evidence of his progressive record.
Veneman stated that he favors the
decentralization of government social
welfare programs.
But this means that local
governments will have to stop being
provincial, he noted. They must start
considering the regional implications
of problems if they are to efficiently
manage programs previously operated
by the federal government.
As lieutenant governor, Veneman
said he would be able to utilize the
experience gained at HEW. Also, he
would be able to promote harmony
between the executive and legislative
branches of government, having served
from 1962 until 1968 in the state
assembly.
Veneman said that he opposed
Proposition 1, the referendum
supported by Gov. Reagan in the
election last November. While he
agreed with its objective of curbing
government spending, he did not
believe that such a measure should
become part of the state's

constitution. Such a measure would
have destroyed the flexibility of state
officials in dealing with taxation, he
explained.
Although he hopes to raise

$435,000 with which to fight the
primary campaign, Veneman insisted
that this amount is not excessive. He
pointed out that there are 3.7 million

CALIFORNIA CANDIDATE -- John Veneman, right, candidate for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor,
told a group of Republican students last night that the GOP still has a chance to win state and local offices in California.

Republican League.
Republicans in the state and if each
one were sent one mailer, that cost
would amount to nearly $400,000.
Rather than pass new laws
regulating campaign spending, existing
statutes should be enforced, Veneman
said. "The key to keeping campaign
spending honest is the disclosure of
the sources of funds," he explained.
Although he will accept support
from lobbyists, he emphasized that he
will publish the names of contributors,
and will make no commitments in
return for financial support. It is "very
traditional" for lobbyists to contribute
money to candidates, he noted.
As part of the Nixon
administration, Veneman noted that
he was able to observe the Nixon staff

in action and received an insight into
why it became involved in scandal.
"The men around Nixon forgot one
thing after 1968," he explained.
"They forgot that they won (the
election). They never made the
transition from a campaign to running
the government." Veneman added that
they were so interested in capturing
publicity and winning the next
election that they neglected the best
interests of the people.
Although many people have urged
him not to run because of the
seemingly dismal Republican
prospects, Veneman stated that if
Republicans must not take a defeatist
attitude. "We still have a two-party
system," Veneman noted. "And it is a
viable system."
