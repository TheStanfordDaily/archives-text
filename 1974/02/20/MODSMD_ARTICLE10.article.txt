# Inertia, Not Apathy, The Problem
##

In her recent letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 15), Jeanne Keller cites "insensitivity
and bad taste" she has noted in recent Daily
articles. Keller correlates the publication of
such "insensitive" articles with the
"degenerating course" of the Stanford Daily.
She blames this course on the "disrespect and
callousness" of the Daily staff.
Keller's lambast of the Daily staff rests on
one implicit assumption: any newspaper has
a broad spectrum of stories which it can
cover. This is certainly true of any "big city"
newspaper, which has a plethora of local and
national stories from which to choose. But
the Daily's primary responsibility is to the
Stanford community, and unfortunately, the
Stanford community has not been
forthcoming with stories worthy of prime
newspaper coverage. About the only activity
which Stanford students have engaged in en
masse in recent months has been "streaking."
There was never such a dearth of campus
activity in the late 60s or early 70s; indeed,
there was often far too much activity, as
witnessed by the wanton destruction of
property. But today, politics, protest, and
virtually any expression of social concern
have vanished from all but a few pockets of
the campus.
'Apathy' A Misnomer
This lack of concern about society and
politics is generally called "student apathy."
Apathy, however, is a misnomer. For apathy
implies a sort of passivity, an inane
tranquility in outlook. It implies a ready,
uncaring acceptance or rejection of change.
These are attitudes which are not present on
the Stanford campus. What is more prevalent
on campus is not apathy, but a state of
inertia — not a ready, uncaring flow with
changes, but an actual resistance to them.

The inertia within the student body here is
not readily apparent, but it is a significant
force opposing any project which requires
the support of Stanford students.
I have become painfully aware of this
inertia in the last month. For the past several
weeks, I have been involved in the effort to
rebuild the ASSU Speakers' Bureau. Until
now, the bureau has been little more than an
agent for the disbursement of funds; now
that the bureau is short on money, it cannot
even fulfill that function.
Recruitment Campaign
The first key step in the revitalizing of the
Speakers' Bureau was to be a massive
recruitment campaign; what the bureau has
needed most in the past has been students
willing to devote a little time to its operation.
It was hoped that after restructuring and
re-staffing, an expanded Speakers' Bureau
would be able to do more than pass out
money: it would be able to take an active
role in bringing dynamic, knowledgeable
speakers from all fields of interest to
Stanford.
We are now well over a week into our
recruitment campaign. The responses so far
have not been encouraging: I have received a
letter from an alumnus in Denver,
congratulating me on my efforts; I have
received a threatening call from a student
who vows that he will tear down any further
leaflets I post; most disappointingly, I have
received only four applications.
These results do not indicate apathy in the
student body; quite the contrary. All of the
discussions I have had and the
encouragement I have received indicate a
great deal of interest in an expanded
speakers' program. Even after the lagging
recruitment campaign, these signs are still

there. Yet for all the interest in the bureau,
there is an unwillingness among Stanford
students to devote any time or energy to
creating the Speakers' Bureau they would
like to see.
Not Rabble-Rousing
If the Speakers' Bureau recruitment
campaign was an attempt at political
rabble-rousing on campus, then this
unwillingness to help would be
understandable. It could be attributed to a
deep-seated disillusionment with social
reform, and a general boredom with radical
politics.
But the Speakers' Bureau is not trying to
recruit political activists; all we need are
people interested in learning about every side
of issues. Political consciousness is not even a
prerequisite for working with the bureau: we
are in just as great a need of students
interested in the arts and sciences, and
bringing visitors to campus from these fields.
Inertia: Final Word?
If the inertia I have encountered thus far
in revitalizing the Speakers' Bureau is the
student body's final word on the program,
then the Stanford campus has lost far more
than its radical politicians; it has lost interest
in objective social and cultural inquiry, and
in the one program capable of providing the
answers to such inquiry.
I am sure that this interest is still alive
somewhere on campus, although it may be
buried somewhere in Escondido Village. I
urge anyone interested in helping to rebuild
the Speakers' Bureau to pick up an
application at the ASSU offices, second
floor, Tresidder Union.

leaflets I post; most disappointingly, I have
received only four applications.
These results do not indicate apathy in the
student body; quite the contrary. All of the
discussions I have had and the
encouragement I have received indicate a
great deal of interest in an expanded
speakers' program. Even after the lagging
recruitment campaign, these signs are still

there. Yet for all the interest in the bureau,
there is an unwillingness among Stanford
students to devote any time or energy to
creating the Speakers' Bureau they would
like to see.
Not Rabble-Rousing
If the Speakers' Bureau recruitment
campaign was an attempt at political
rabble-rousing on campus, then this
unwillingness to help would be
understandable. It could be attributed to a
deep-seated disillusionment with social
reform, and a general boredom with radical
politics.
But the Speakers' Bureau is not trying to
recruit political activists; all we need are
people interested in learning about every side
of issues. Political consciousness is not even a
prerequisite for working with the bureau: we
are in just as great a need of students
interested in the arts and sciences, and
bringing visitors to campus from these fields.
Inertia: Final Word?
If the inertia I have encountered thus far
in revitalizing the Speakers' Bureau is the
student body's final word on the program,
then the Stanford campus has lost far more
than its radical politicians; it has lost interest
in objective social and cultural inquiry, and
in the one program capable of providing the
answers to such inquiry.
I am sure that this interest is still alive
somewhere on campus, although it may be
buried somewhere in Escondido Village. I
urge anyone interested in helping to rebuild
the Speakers' Bureau to pick up an
application at the ASSU offices, second
floor, Tresidder Union.

In her recent letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 15), Jeanne Keller cites "insensitivity
and bad taste" she has noted in recent Daily
articles. Keller correlates the publication of
such "insensitive" articles with the
"degenerating course" of the Stanford Daily.
She blames this course on the "disrespect and
callousness" of the Daily staff.
Keller's lambast of the Daily staff rests on
one implicit assumption: any newspaper has
a broad spectrum of stories which it can
cover. This is certainly true of any "big city"
newspaper, which has a plethora of local and
national stories from which to choose. But
the Daily's primary responsibility is to the
Stanford community, and unfortunately, the
Stanford community has not been
forthcoming with stories worthy of prime
newspaper coverage. About the only activity
which Stanford students have engaged in en
masse in recent months has been "streaking."
There was never such a dearth of campus
activity in the late 60s or early 70s; indeed,
there was often far too much activity, as
witnessed by the wanton destruction of
property. But today, politics, protest, and
virtually any expression of social concern
have vanished from all but a few pockets of
the campus.
'Apathy' A Misnomer
This lack of concern about society and
politics is generally called "student apathy."
Apathy, however, is a misnomer. For apathy
implies a sort of passivity, an inane
tranquility in outlook. It implies a ready,
uncaring acceptance or rejection of change.
These are attitudes which are not present on
the Stanford campus. What is more prevalent
on campus is not apathy, but a state of
inertia — not a ready, uncaring flow with
changes, but an actual resistance to them.

The inertia within the student body here is
not readily apparent, but it is a significant
force opposing any project which requires
the support of Stanford students.
I have become painfully aware of this
inertia in the last month. For the past several
weeks, I have been involved in the effort to
rebuild the ASSU Speakers' Bureau. Until
now, the bureau has been little more than an
agent for the disbursement of funds; now
that the bureau is short on money, it cannot
even fulfill that function.
Recruitment Campaign
The first key step in the revitalizing of the
Speakers' Bureau was to be a massive
recruitment campaign; what the bureau has
needed most in the past has been students
willing to devote a little time to its operation.
It was hoped that after restructuring and
re-staffing, an expanded Speakers' Bureau
would be able to do more than pass out
money: it would be able to take an active
role in bringing dynamic, knowledgeable
speakers from all fields of interest to
Stanford.
We are now well over a week into our
recruitment campaign. The responses so far
have not been encouraging: I have received a
letter from an alumnus in Denver,
congratulating me on my efforts; I have
received a threatening call from a student
who vows that he will tear down any further
leaflets I post; most disappointingly, I have
received only four applications.

virtually any expression of social concern
have vanished from all but a few pockets of
the campus.
'Apathy' A Misnomer
This lack of concern about society and
politics is generally called "student apathy."
Apathy, however, is a misnomer. For apathy
implies a sort of passivity, an inane
tranquility in outlook. It implies a ready,
uncaring acceptance or rejection of change.
These are attitudes which are not present on
the Stanford campus. What is more prevalent
on campus is not apathy, but a state of
inertia — not a ready, uncaring flow with
changes, but an actual resistance to them.

The inertia within the student body here is
not readily apparent, but it is a significant
force opposing any project which requires
the support of Stanford students.
I have become painfully aware of this
inertia in the last month. For the past several
weeks, I have been involved in the effort to
rebuild the ASSU Speakers' Bureau. Until
now, the bureau has been little more than an
agent for the disbursement of funds; now
that the bureau is short on money, it cannot
even fulfill that function.
Recruitment Campaign
The first key step in the revitalizing of the
Speakers' Bureau was to be a massive
recruitment campaign; what the bureau has
needed most in the past has been students
willing to devote a little time to its operation.
It was hoped that after restructuring and
re-staffing, an expanded Speakers' Bureau
would be able to do more than pass out
money: it would be able to take an active
role in bringing dynamic, knowledgeable
speakers from all fields of interest to
Stanford.
We are now well over a week into our
recruitment campaign. The responses so far
have not been encouraging: I have received a
letter from an alumnus in Denver,
congratulating me on my efforts; I have
received a threatening call from a student
who vows that he will tear down any further
leaflets I post; most disappointingly, I have
received only four applications.
These results do not indicate apathy in the
student body; quite the contrary. All of the
discussions I have had and the
encouragement I have received indicate a
great deal of interest in an expanded
speakers' program. Even after the lagging
recruitment campaign, these signs are still

there. Yet for all the interest in the bureau,
there is an unwillingness among Stanford
students to devote any time or energy to
creating the Speakers' Bureau they would
like to see.
Not Rabble-Rousing
If the Speakers' Bureau recruitment
campaign was an attempt at political
rabble-rousing on campus, then this
unwillingness to help would be
understandable. It could be attributed to a
deep-seated disillusionment with social
reform, and a general boredom with radical
politics.
But the Speakers' Bureau is not trying to
recruit political activists; all we need are
people interested in learning about every side
of issues. Political consciousness is not even a
prerequisite for working with the bureau: we
are in just as great a need of students
interested in the arts and sciences, and
bringing visitors to campus from these fields.
Inertia: Final Word?
If the inertia I have encountered thus far
in revitalizing the Speakers' Bureau is the
student body's final word on the program,
then the Stanford campus has lost far more
than its radical politicians; it has lost interest
in objective social and cultural inquiry, and
in the one program capable of providing the
answers to such inquiry.
I am sure that this interest is still alive
somewhere on campus, although it may be
buried somewhere in Escondido Village. I
urge anyone interested in helping to rebuild
the Speakers' Bureau to pick up an
application at the ASSU offices, second
floor, Tresidder Union.

In her recent letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 15), Jeanne Keller cites "insensitivity
and bad taste" she has noted in recent Daily
articles. Keller correlates the publication of
such "insensitive" articles with the
"degenerating course" of the Stanford Daily.
She blames this course on the "disrespect and
callousness" of the Daily staff.
Keller's lambast of the Daily staff rests on
one implicit assumption: any newspaper has
a broad spectrum of stories which it can
cover. This is certainly true of any "big city"
newspaper, which has a plethora of local and
national stories from which to choose. But
the Daily's primary responsibility is to the
Stanford community, and unfortunately, the
Stanford community has not been
forthcoming with stories worthy of prime
newspaper coverage. About the only activity
which Stanford students have engaged in en
masse in recent months has been "streaking."
There was never such a dearth of campus
activity in the late 60s or early 70s; indeed,
there was often far too much activity, as
witnessed by the wanton destruction of
property. But today, politics, protest, and
virtually any expression of social concern
have vanished from all but a few pockets of
the campus.
