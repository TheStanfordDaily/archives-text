# Consider Campus In Middle East

The Stanford overseas
program, under the leadership of
Director Mark Mancall, is now
undergoing dramatic change and
rebirth. This new direction has
meant the development of
programs with varying structures,
programs in which Stanford
students are encouraged to fully
experience the foreign culture. It
is in this spirit that Beirut is
proposed as a Stanford overseas
campus.
Originally focusing on Western
European countries, Stanford sent
students to countries with
cultures similar to their own,
cultures the students could come
to know after an exposure period
of six months. The overseas
office is now seeking locations
where students can gain an
introduction to non-Western
cultures without experiencing
severe culture shock.
The Middle East, though
assuredly different in nature to
the American scene, boasts a rich
heritage which could prove of
infinite value to the Stanford
student. And we feel that Beirut
which serves as the threshold,
would be an excellent spot for a
Stanford program in the area.
New Middle East Role
The new role which the Middle
East assumed in the late 1960s
and early 1970s is one of world
predominance in the petroleum
industry and of key value to the
interests of the superpowers.
The American University of
Beirut is a major university in the
Middle East and provides the
student with first-rate facilities, a
diverse curriculum and a high
quality faculty. The faculty of
the Arts and Sciences,
Engineering, and Agricultural
Sciences Divisions together offer

35 programs of study to a student
body representing 70 countries. In
1972-73, 206 Americans out of
4386 students attended the
A.U.B.
But the wide variety of courses
offered would enable a general
studies student, as well as the
pre-med, engineer and architect,
to gain valuable exposure to a
foreign environment while
fulfilling requirements for a
particular field. This, we feel, is
another advantage to A.U.B. and
one of great importance in
determining the site of the
overseas program. With the
increased interest of many
Stanford students in technical
professions, these students might
otherwise have to pass up
opportunities for overseas study
due to various requirements of a
major. Moreover, The American
University of Beirut serves as a
window to the Middle East.
Geographically and politically,
Beirut affords easy access to
Egypt, Greece, Israel, Syria and
Turkey.
Facilities Exist
Stanford has the facilities, the
administrators and the scholars, as
potential, to develop such a
program. An A.U.B. program
would complement existing
courses now offered throughout
Stanford departments.
There are many advantages to
study in Lebanon. More so than
any other country in the Middle
East, Lebanon is a
multi-confessional, multi-ethnic
society. The conflicts and crises
that arise out of conflicting ethnic
interests have been successfully
dealt with by the Lebanese, and
their solution provides a case
study for students interested in

observing such phenomena and in
solving ethnic difficulties in other
areas. Certainly a student with
study experience in Lebanon
would gain a new perspective on
ethnic strife in the United States
and might be able to offer some
effective solutions for our
problems.
Furthermore, a student
studying in Lebanon can witness
the impact of modernization on a
traditional society. Western
technology, philosophy, and life
styles have now taken root in
Lebanon and has affected the
society in varying manners. The
health conditions, kinship
relations, and sex roles of
Lebanese have changed according
to the origin and religion of each
ethnic group. The social gradient
which now exists in Lebanon —
from traditional to modern living
of the Breek, Maranite, Armenian,
Arab Christian, Arab Muslim and
Druz — represents a unique
example of industrial impact on a
relatively underdeveloped nation
and a rare environment for high
quality education.
'Geopolitical Significance'
The Middle East will be a
major influence on world
economics and political
developments for years to come as
a result of the area's natural
resources and of its geopolitical
significance. To maintain our
present leadership in the academic
community, people at Stanford —
faculty and students — should be
informed and able to interpret the
future of this area.
To turn our backs on this area
and its future is to turn our backs
on a relevant part of our future.
To stay at the helm, Stanford
should remain current; to remain

current, Stanford should remain
flexible.
