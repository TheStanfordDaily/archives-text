Particularly upsetting were the
Daily editorial of Feb. 12 and the
Wascher article of the same day.
Rather than "too little, too late,'"
Jim Friend's activity is to be
commended for helping to focus
campus concern on the Row issue,
albeit late (if that is indeed the
case). The question might be
whether contemplation of
administration policies can
develop in an atmosphere so
centralized that suggestions
enunciate responses that it is hard
enough to run this campus,
without ten thousand people to
contend with.
Thus the Daily editorial was
quite incorrect in calling the
ASSU referendum "an expensive
luxury." Similarly, saying that
there "was precious little
'informed student sentiment' to
be gauged," overlooked the
meeting which filled the large
room at Tresidder the evening of
Jan. 31.
The audience predominantly
opposed not the nature of this
inspired emeritus faculty housing
project, but the site selected for
it. Though administration
representatives were fairly
convincing in claiming they were
not seeking destruction of the
Row and its wooden houses, it
should still be kept in mind that
use of the site at issue would
require relocation of the day care
center (with adjacent playing
fields) and Grove (Hurlburt)
House, as well as extensively
modifying the student character
of the area. In other words, there
is a major cause for concern amid
increasingly-informed community
focus.
Wording Imperfect
The referendum may not have
been worded so as to delight the
law profession, nor did it
implicitly enunciate alternatives.
However, these do exist. Site J,
presently vacant along Mayfield at
Coronado and stretching toward
campus, plus the vacant portion
of Site L, on the opposite corner
of Dolores and Mayfield, would
provide a site also close to
campus, but interfacing between a
present faculty dwelling area and
the student "ghetto," rather than
outrageously intruding into the
latter.
This alternative would properly
provide about 65 dwelling units
rather than the 90 or so
envisioned, but is superficially
rated for less capacity on the basis
of present density. Yet it is
important to recognize such rating
as a tool toward a greater concern
that area character be maintained.
One can only wonder how Lewis
Mumford would view the use of
numbers ostensibly based on
master plan goals to subvert those
very goals.
'Edifice Complex'
But so it goes among those at
the mercy of others who suffer
from "edifice complex."
Students, perhaps to be joined by
alumni and faculty, may have a
greater sense of the "soul of this
university" than the "faceless
men" to which this age is prone.
Certainly, the wish of Santa Clara
County to exert some measure of
influence on expansionist
Stanford planning may well spring
from the same roots, i.e., the idea
that this uniquely-attractive
University may need "defenders
as well as champions."

representatives were fairly
convincing in claiming they were
not seeking destruction of the
Row and its wooden houses, it
should still be kept in mind that
use of the site at issue would
require relocation of the day care
center (with adjacent playing
fields) and Grove (Hurlburt)
House, as well as extensively
modifying the student character
of the area. In other words, there
is a major cause for concern amid
increasingly-informed community
focus.
Wording Imperfect
The referendum may not have
been worded so as to delight the
law profession, nor did it
implicitly enunciate alternatives.
However, these do exist. Site J,
presently vacant along Mayfield at
Coronado and stretching toward
campus, plus the vacant portion
of Site L, on the opposite corner
of Dolores and Mayfield, would
provide a site also close to
campus, but interfacing between a
present faculty dwelling area and
the student "ghetto," rather than
outrageously intruding into the
latter.
This alternative would properly
provide about 65 dwelling units
rather than the 90 or so
envisioned, but is superficially
rated for less capacity on the basis
of present density. Yet it is
important to recognize such rating
as a tool toward a greater concern
that area character be maintained.
One can only wonder how Lewis
Mumford would view the use of
numbers ostensibly based on
master plan goals to subvert those
very goals.
'Edifice Complex'
But so it goes among those at
the mercy of others who suffer
from "edifice complex."
Students, perhaps to be joined by
alumni and faculty, may have a
greater sense of the "soul of this
university" than the "faceless
men" to which this age is prone.
Certainly, the wish of Santa Clara
County to exert some measure of
influence on expansionist
Stanford planning may well spring
from the same roots, i.e., the idea
that this uniquely-attractive
University may need "defenders
as well as champions."

Particularly upsetting were the
Daily editorial of Feb. 12 and the
Wascher article of the same day.
Rather than "too little, too late,'"
Jim Friend's activity is to be
commended for helping to focus
campus concern on the Row issue,
albeit late (if that is indeed the
case). The question might be
whether contemplation of
administration policies can
develop in an atmosphere so
centralized that suggestions
enunciate responses that it is hard
enough to run this campus,
without ten thousand people to
contend with.
Thus the Daily editorial was
quite incorrect in calling the
ASSU referendum "an expensive
luxury." Similarly, saying that
there "was precious little
'informed student sentiment' to
be gauged," overlooked the
meeting which filled the large
room at Tresidder the evening of
Jan. 31.
The audience predominantly
opposed not the nature of this
inspired emeritus faculty housing
project, but the site selected for
it. Though administration
representatives were fairly
convincing in claiming they were
not seeking destruction of the
Row and its wooden houses, it
should still be kept in mind that
use of the site at issue would
require relocation of the day care
