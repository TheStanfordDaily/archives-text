# SAIO Suggests Program Improvements

### SUSAN LUTTNER 
"A lot of times you think half in Navajo and half in English —
Navajo logic is illogical in English, but you are writing for a white
professor so you have to switch to English thinking."
"The reason I went to college is to prepare myself so I could go
back home and be beneficial."
"It's brutal to have come from a reservation and just be dumped
here."
These comments by native American students interviewed last
winter express some of the problems native Americans face in
adjusting to the predominantly white culture of the University.
In 1969 there were only six native American undergraduates on
campus. In 1970, 25 native American students entered under
the newly formed Stanford American Indian Project.
This first sizeable group of students, who were provided with a
counseling office in the Old Union, established the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) and requested a native American theme
house in the dorms. Since then, SAIO has been trying to improve the
University's program for native American students.
After a request by SAIO to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, a
native American cultural center is scheduled to open on Feb. 23 in the
lower level of the Women's Clubhouse. The center had been
recommended by Director of Student Affairs Research John Black.
The center will provide a central activity base for native Americans
on campus as well as a link to native Americans in the surrounding
area, stated officials of SAIO last spring in a proposal for the center.
"What I'd like to see is not only a cultural center for native
Americans but also a resource and communication center for others
[on campus]," said Benjamin Atencio, temporary coordinator of the
center.
Native American Fellows Program
In an effort to improve cultural identity for entering native
Americans, The Educational Foundation of America initiated native
American Fellows Program in December. The $11,000 grant will
provide stipends of $500 each for seven native American fellows who
will have various advisory responsibilities in the Indian community.
Last winter Black and a group of native American graduate
students conducted taped interviews with over half of the
undergraduate native Americans on campus. They independently
compiled suggestions for improving the American Indian Project.
SAIO quoted Black in the proposal for a cultural center: "It is
clear that good grades per se have almost no intrinsic value for the
native American students, now or in their earlier schooling. They
appear to be much more concerned with whether they are learning

and whether what they are learning has value or relevance."
Black also wrote that there was a unanimous feeling among native
American students that they are learning now in order to help their
race.
Sara Sneed, an RA in the native American theme house, Soto,
agreed with Black's conclusion, "I think we're aware of that here, and
remember to relate what we're doing here to change at home. That's
one of the strong points of our group."
Well-meaning missionaries
Sneed said that Indian affairs have been in the hands of
"well-meaning missionaries" for years, and little progress has been
made. "You can work out your own degree in Indian studies, but I
would rather learn history and law to prepare me for doing
something."
Chris Peters, a native American advisor, said that some
appreciation of Indina culture is necessary if these students plan to
accomplish some change. "You can't expect to apply white law to
Indian situations without some background and experience in Indian
law and Indian history."
One native American undergraduate described his dilemma, "I
wanted to learn more about Indians, but I knew that I was going to be
learning more about whites .. . but I needed more training. It's
becoming more tragic, because when I do take classes I just can't
relate to some of the things and I really have to struggle."
Improving Course Offerings
Current plans for academic change focus on improving course
offerings in existing departments.
Ken Fields, resident fellow at Soto and professor of English, is
working with students to put out a native American issue of a literary
magazine, Chowder Review. Students will solicit and contribute
poetry and short stories for the publication and receive credit through
the English department.
According to George Spindler of the Anthropology Department, a
group of native American students last spring worked out an
orientation course for entering students and implemented it this fall.
Spindler said they tried to keep the program in the hands of the
Indian students. "We're very eager to be supportive, but we don't
want to take it over and make it our thing," said Spindler.
Gwen Shunatona, assistant to the dean of student affairs in charge
of the native American counseling office, criticizes departments for
relegating courses on Indian affairs to the status of Undergraduate
Specials and special study programs. "Some recognition of the validity
of these projects is still wanting."

One of the problems in improving academic offerings for native
American studies is lack of qualified faculty members. This year the
University hired its first native American professor, N. Scott
Momaday, who taught "American Indian Mythology, Legend, and
Lore" fall quarter.
Momaday is currently on leave until summer quarter. John Loftis,
chairman of the English Department explained, "He's a famous man,
and he's much in demand."
Spindier said that one of the priorities in the Anthropology
Department ir future appointments is a specialist in native American
cultures. He emphasized, however that they were not sure how many
or how soon appointments will be available.
Anthropology Offerings
The Anthropology Department has oifered at least five courses a
year for the last three years dealing exclusively or heavily with native
American cultures. "In terms of our present staff and the things that
we have to do, we're offering about what we can now," said Spindier.
An objection raised by Peters, a native American counselor, to
courses offered now is that they deal with Indian culture from a white
perspective. One of the courses about native Americans offered in the
Anthropology Department is "Archaeological Field Methods."
Peters suggested that professors in existing departments learn more
about Indian affairs and incorporate this knowledge into their classes
when appropriate.
Marlene Laclair, senior RA at Soto, said the University could
establish a good program in Indian studies, "at the expense of other
schools with a higher native American concentration." Similarly,
Sneed said that "Indians in higher education are few," and that there
are more important things to do than lecturing at a university.
Culture Shock
Reports by students and administrators indicate that the "culture
shock" experience; by many first-year college students may be worse
for native Americans, who are unlikely to have even a peer of similar
background for security.
The 57 undergraduate and 22 graduate native Americans at
Stanford represent at least 30 different tribes from all over the
country.
Sneed described one of the value differences which makes her feel
misunderstood in history clsses. "You don't realize it until you get
into the sixth grade and teachers tell you about American heroes like
Andrew Jackson," who forced the Cherokees out of their land in
Georgia. She reported that similar misunderstandings between cultures
also exist in University classes.
"A lot of times you think half in Navajo and half in English —
Navajo logic is illogical in English, but you are writing for a white
professor so you have to switch to English thinking."

courses offered now is that they deal with Indian culture from a white
perspective. One of the courses about native Americans offered in the
Anthropology Department is "Archaeological Field Methods."
Peters suggested that professors in existing departments learn more
about Indian affairs and incorporate this knowledge into their classes
when appropriate.
Marlene Laclair, senior RA at Soto, said the University could
establish a good program in Indian studies, "at the expense of other
schools with a higher native American concentration." Similarly,
Sneed said that "Indians in higher education are few," and that there
are more important things to do than lecturing at a university.
Culture Shock
Reports by students and administrators indicate that the "culture
shock" experience; by many first-year college students may be worse
for native Americans, who are unlikely to have even a peer of similar
background for security.
The 57 undergraduate and 22 graduate native Americans at
Stanford represent at least 30 different tribes from all over the
country.
Sneed described one of the value differences which makes her feel
misunderstood in history clsses. "You don't realize it until you get
into the sixth grade and teachers tell you about American heroes like
Andrew Jackson," who forced the Cherokees out of their land in
Georgia. She reported that similar misunderstandings between cultures
also exist in University classes.
"A lot of times you think half in Navajo and half in English —
Navajo logic is illogical in English, but you are writing for a white
professor so you have to switch to English thinking."
"The reason I went to college is to prepare myself so I could go
back home and be beneficial."
"It's brutal to have come from a reservation and just be dumped
here."
These comments by native American students interviewed last
winter express some of the problems native Americans face in
adjusting to the predominantly white culture of the University.
In 1969 there were only six native American undergraduates on
campus. In 1970, 25 native American students entered under
the newly formed Stanford American Indian Project.
This first sizeable group of students, who were provided with a
counseling office in the Old Union, established the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) and requested a native American theme
house in the dorms. Since then, SAIO has been trying to improve the
University's program for native American students.
After a request by SAIO to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, a
native American cultural center is scheduled to open on Feb. 23 in the
lower level of the Women's Clubhouse. The center had been
recommended by Director of Student Affairs Research John Black.
The center will provide a central activity base for native Americans
on campus as well as a link to native Americans in the surrounding
area, stated officials of SAIO last spring in a proposal for the center.
"What I'd like to see is not only a cultural center for native
Americans but also a resource and communication center for others
[on campus]," said Benjamin Atencio, temporary coordinator of the
center.
Native American Fellows Program
In an effort to improve cultural identity for entering native
Americans, The Educational Foundation of America initiated native
American Fellows Program in December. The $11,000 grant will
provide stipends of $500 each for seven native American fellows who
will have various advisory responsibilities in the Indian community.
Last winter Black and a group of native American graduate
students conducted taped interviews with over half of the
undergraduate native Americans on campus. They independently
compiled suggestions for improving the American Indian Project.
SAIO quoted Black in the proposal for a cultural center: "It is
clear that good grades per se have almost no intrinsic value for the
native American students, now or in their earlier schooling. They
appear to be much more concerned with whether they are learning

and whether what they are learning has value or relevance."
Black also wrote that there was a unanimous feeling among native
American students that they are learning now in order to help their
race.
Sara Sneed, an RA in the native American theme house, Soto,
agreed with Black's conclusion, "I think we're aware of that here, and
remember to relate what we're doing here to change at home. That's
one of the strong points of our group."
Well-meaning missionaries
Sneed said that Indian affairs have been in the hands of
"well-meaning missionaries" for years, and little progress has been
made. "You can work out your own degree in Indian studies, but I
would rather learn history and law to prepare me for doing
something."
Chris Peters, a native American advisor, said that some
appreciation of Indina culture is necessary if these students plan to
accomplish some change. "You can't expect to apply white law to
Indian situations without some background and experience in Indian
law and Indian history."
One native American undergraduate described his dilemma, "I
wanted to learn more about Indians, but I knew that I was going to be
learning more about whites .. . but I needed more training. It's
becoming more tragic, because when I do take classes I just can't
relate to some of the things and I really have to struggle."
Improving Course Offerings
Current plans for academic change focus on improving course
offerings in existing departments.
Ken Fields, resident fellow at Soto and professor of English, is
working with students to put out a native American issue of a literary
magazine, Chowder Review. Students will solicit and contribute
poetry and short stories for the publication and receive credit through
the English department.
According to George Spindler of the Anthropology Department, a
group of native American students last spring worked out an
orientation course for entering students and implemented it this fall.
Spindler said they tried to keep the program in the hands of the
Indian students. "We're very eager to be supportive, but we don't
want to take it over and make it our thing," said Spindler.
Gwen Shunatona, assistant to the dean of student affairs in charge
of the native American counseling office, criticizes departments for
relegating courses on Indian affairs to the status of Undergraduate
Specials and special study programs. "Some recognition of the validity
of these projects is still wanting."

One of the problems in improving academic offerings for native
American studies is lack of qualified faculty members. This year the
University hired its first native American professor, N. Scott
Momaday, who taught "American Indian Mythology, Legend, and
Lore" fall quarter.
Momaday is currently on leave until summer quarter. John Loftis,
chairman of the English Department explained, "He's a famous man,
and he's much in demand."
Spindier said that one of the priorities in the Anthropology
Department ir future appointments is a specialist in native American
cultures. He emphasized, however that they were not sure how many
or how soon appointments will be available.
Anthropology Offerings
The Anthropology Department has oifered at least five courses a
year for the last three years dealing exclusively or heavily with native
American cultures. "In terms of our present staff and the things that
we have to do, we're offering about what we can now," said Spindier.

Indian students. "We're very eager to be supportive, but we don't
want to take it over and make it our thing," said Spindler.
Gwen Shunatona, assistant to the dean of student affairs in charge
of the native American counseling office, criticizes departments for
relegating courses on Indian affairs to the status of Undergraduate
Specials and special study programs. "Some recognition of the validity
of these projects is still wanting."

One of the problems in improving academic offerings for native
American studies is lack of qualified faculty members. This year the
University hired its first native American professor, N. Scott
Momaday, who taught "American Indian Mythology, Legend, and
Lore" fall quarter.
Momaday is currently on leave until summer quarter. John Loftis,
chairman of the English Department explained, "He's a famous man,
and he's much in demand."
Spindier said that one of the priorities in the Anthropology
Department ir future appointments is a specialist in native American
cultures. He emphasized, however that they were not sure how many
or how soon appointments will be available.
Anthropology Offerings
The Anthropology Department has oifered at least five courses a
year for the last three years dealing exclusively or heavily with native
American cultures. "In terms of our present staff and the things that
we have to do, we're offering about what we can now," said Spindier.
An objection raised by Peters, a native American counselor, to
courses offered now is that they deal with Indian culture from a white
perspective. One of the courses about native Americans offered in the
Anthropology Department is "Archaeological Field Methods."
Peters suggested that professors in existing departments learn more
about Indian affairs and incorporate this knowledge into their classes
when appropriate.
Marlene Laclair, senior RA at Soto, said the University could
establish a good program in Indian studies, "at the expense of other
schools with a higher native American concentration." Similarly,
Sneed said that "Indians in higher education are few," and that there
are more important things to do than lecturing at a university.
Culture Shock
Reports by students and administrators indicate that the "culture
shock" experience; by many first-year college students may be worse
for native Americans, who are unlikely to have even a peer of similar
background for security.
The 57 undergraduate and 22 graduate native Americans at
Stanford represent at least 30 different tribes from all over the
country.
Sneed described one of the value differences which makes her feel
misunderstood in history clsses. "You don't realize it until you get
into the sixth grade and teachers tell you about American heroes like
Andrew Jackson," who forced the Cherokees out of their land in
Georgia. She reported that similar misunderstandings between cultures
also exist in University classes.
"A lot of times you think half in Navajo and half in English —
Navajo logic is illogical in English, but you are writing for a white
professor so you have to switch to English thinking."
"The reason I went to college is to prepare myself so I could go
back home and be beneficial."
"It's brutal to have come from a reservation and just be dumped
here."
These comments by native American students interviewed last
winter express some of the problems native Americans face in
adjusting to the predominantly white culture of the University.
In 1969 there were only six native American undergraduates on
campus. In 1970, 25 native American students entered under
the newly formed Stanford American Indian Project.
This first sizeable group of students, who were provided with a
counseling office in the Old Union, established the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) and requested a native American theme
house in the dorms. Since then, SAIO has been trying to improve the
University's program for native American students.
After a request by SAIO to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, a
native American cultural center is scheduled to open on Feb. 23 in the
lower level of the Women's Clubhouse. The center had been
recommended by Director of Student Affairs Research John Black.
The center will provide a central activity base for native Americans
on campus as well as a link to native Americans in the surrounding
area, stated officials of SAIO last spring in a proposal for the center.
"What I'd like to see is not only a cultural center for native
Americans but also a resource and communication center for others
[on campus]," said Benjamin Atencio, temporary coordinator of the
center.
Native American Fellows Program
In an effort to improve cultural identity for entering native
Americans, The Educational Foundation of America initiated native
American Fellows Program in December. The $11,000 grant will
provide stipends of $500 each for seven native American fellows who
will have various advisory responsibilities in the Indian community.
Last winter Black and a group of native American graduate
students conducted taped interviews with over half of the
undergraduate native Americans on campus. They independently
compiled suggestions for improving the American Indian Project.
SAIO quoted Black in the proposal for a cultural center: "It is
clear that good grades per se have almost no intrinsic value for the
native American students, now or in their earlier schooling. They
appear to be much more concerned with whether they are learning

and whether what they are learning has value or relevance."
Black also wrote that there was a unanimous feeling among native
American students that they are learning now in order to help their
race.
Sara Sneed, an RA in the native American theme house, Soto,
agreed with Black's conclusion, "I think we're aware of that here, and
remember to relate what we're doing here to change at home. That's
one of the strong points of our group."
Well-meaning missionaries
Sneed said that Indian affairs have been in the hands of
"well-meaning missionaries" for years, and little progress has been
made. "You can work out your own degree in Indian studies, but I
would rather learn history and law to prepare me for doing
something."
Chris Peters, a native American advisor, said that some
appreciation of Indina culture is necessary if these students plan to
accomplish some change. "You can't expect to apply white law to
Indian situations without some background and experience in Indian
law and Indian history."
One native American undergraduate described his dilemma, "I
wanted to learn more about Indians, but I knew that I was going to be
learning more about whites .. . but I needed more training. It's
becoming more tragic, because when I do take classes I just can't
relate to some of the things and I really have to struggle."
Improving Course Offerings
Current plans for academic change focus on improving course
offerings in existing departments.
Ken Fields, resident fellow at Soto and professor of English, is
working with students to put out a native American issue of a literary
magazine, Chowder Review. Students will solicit and contribute
poetry and short stories for the publication and receive credit through
the English department.
According to George Spindler of the Anthropology Department, a
group of native American students last spring worked out an
orientation course for entering students and implemented it this fall.
Spindler said they tried to keep the program in the hands of the
Indian students. "We're very eager to be supportive, but we don't
want to take it over and make it our thing," said Spindler.

"well-meaning missionaries" for years, and little progress has been
made. "You can work out your own degree in Indian studies, but I
would rather learn history and law to prepare me for doing
something."
Chris Peters, a native American advisor, said that some
appreciation of Indina culture is necessary if these students plan to
accomplish some change. "You can't expect to apply white law to
Indian situations without some background and experience in Indian
law and Indian history."
One native American undergraduate described his dilemma, "I
wanted to learn more about Indians, but I knew that I was going to be
learning more about whites .. . but I needed more training. It's
becoming more tragic, because when I do take classes I just can't
relate to some of the things and I really have to struggle."
Improving Course Offerings
Current plans for academic change focus on improving course
offerings in existing departments.
Ken Fields, resident fellow at Soto and professor of English, is
working with students to put out a native American issue of a literary
magazine, Chowder Review. Students will solicit and contribute
poetry and short stories for the publication and receive credit through
the English department.
According to George Spindler of the Anthropology Department, a
group of native American students last spring worked out an
orientation course for entering students and implemented it this fall.
Spindler said they tried to keep the program in the hands of the
Indian students. "We're very eager to be supportive, but we don't
want to take it over and make it our thing," said Spindler.
Gwen Shunatona, assistant to the dean of student affairs in charge
of the native American counseling office, criticizes departments for
relegating courses on Indian affairs to the status of Undergraduate
Specials and special study programs. "Some recognition of the validity
of these projects is still wanting."

One of the problems in improving academic offerings for native
American studies is lack of qualified faculty members. This year the
University hired its first native American professor, N. Scott
Momaday, who taught "American Indian Mythology, Legend, and
Lore" fall quarter.
Momaday is currently on leave until summer quarter. John Loftis,
chairman of the English Department explained, "He's a famous man,
and he's much in demand."
Spindier said that one of the priorities in the Anthropology
Department ir future appointments is a specialist in native American
cultures. He emphasized, however that they were not sure how many
or how soon appointments will be available.
Anthropology Offerings
The Anthropology Department has oifered at least five courses a
year for the last three years dealing exclusively or heavily with native
American cultures. "In terms of our present staff and the things that
we have to do, we're offering about what we can now," said Spindier.
An objection raised by Peters, a native American counselor, to
courses offered now is that they deal with Indian culture from a white
perspective. One of the courses about native Americans offered in the
Anthropology Department is "Archaeological Field Methods."
Peters suggested that professors in existing departments learn more
about Indian affairs and incorporate this knowledge into their classes
when appropriate.
Marlene Laclair, senior RA at Soto, said the University could
establish a good program in Indian studies, "at the expense of other
schools with a higher native American concentration." Similarly,
Sneed said that "Indians in higher education are few," and that there
are more important things to do than lecturing at a university.
Culture Shock
Reports by students and administrators indicate that the "culture
shock" experience; by many first-year college students may be worse
for native Americans, who are unlikely to have even a peer of similar
background for security.
The 57 undergraduate and 22 graduate native Americans at
Stanford represent at least 30 different tribes from all over the
country.
Sneed described one of the value differences which makes her feel
misunderstood in history clsses. "You don't realize it until you get
into the sixth grade and teachers tell you about American heroes like
Andrew Jackson," who forced the Cherokees out of their land in
Georgia. She reported that similar misunderstandings between cultures
also exist in University classes.
