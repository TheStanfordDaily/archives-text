# ‘Miquiztli’ Gives Chicano Fiction
## 
### JOHN FELSTINER 
Miquiztli (Mee-Arees-tlee), the
Stanford chicano undergraduate
journal of art and literature, is
being sold on campus for 50
cents. With a revealing
introduction by Arturo Islas, and
six diverse stories by students, it is
unquestionably worth reading.
"For the first time in the
history of the most reputable
private university of the West,"
Islas points out, there has been
enough chicano writing to choose
from.
"The Token," by Josie
Jaramillo, has a white co-ed
complacently befriending a
chicana. Maria fails calculus; then,
to the co-ed's amusement,
doggedly signs up for it again.
Though the narrative gains by
taking both girls viewpoints, the
Anglo seems mechanically
condescending. Maria Melendez'
Raices Cafes con Puntas Gueras
("Brown Roots with Frosted
Tips") deftly mixes one girl's
dislike and envy of her
over-made-up rival.
Curadas, by Jose Razo,
challenges Anglo norms and
restrictions. Curadas are good
times, crazy escapades that "cure"
you, restore your strength. In this
story, some friends from "our
Barrio in the dorm" manage after
a dangerous scuffle to steal a kilo
of marijuana from a "sissy and
kind of dumb" gabacho (North
American), while other freshmen
look on.
Matter-Of-Fact
It ends matter-of-factly on a
note of unresolved ambivalence
over what has happened.
The first issue of Miquiztli
(Fall, 1972) bitterly cited Anglo
emptiness, repression, war. One
essay contrasted Anglo
materialism with chicano culture,
"filled with the wisdom and
mistakes of men as well as the
care and love of women."
Another fantasy had Caucasians
dying out from pollutants that
don't affect colored races. There
was also some satire on chicano
poses and machismo.
The issue just published,
beautifully decorated by Islas and
Jose Padilla with Aztec motifs,
differs essentially from the first,
and not because attitudes have
changed. The fiction here
embodies an alternative vision.
Anglo villains and chicano
victims, pride or self-dividedness,
are not so central to telling the
story as is an open path into and
out of one's self, family, home,
and past.
Childhood Stories
The more developed pieces
deal with childhood. Caroline
Castillo's Chavalitas Mocosas
("Snotty-Nosed Little Girls")
opens with the narrator's daddy
beating her and her sister, after
which mama, smooth and warm
and sweet-smelling, comforts

them. The story is beautifully told
by the child without a trace of
false sentiment or moralizing. It
registers the sisters'
half-perceptions — lovemaking
from the next room ("maybe
she's crying") — and ends as they
find the nerve to get back at their
father for beating them.
Razo's dialogue, indeed the
entire account, is brisk and
convincing.
In La Caza ("The Chase"),
Anna Fisher, in love with a boy
her own age, gets an aunt and
uncle to recount their courtship
back in Mexico. Her aunt was 17,
her uncle 30 — Anna hears him
justify this: "So the man can keep
hold of his wife and teach her.
And since the woman ages quicker
than the man, thirteen years
difference is perfect." Yet it is a
loving marriage, lovingly
recreated.
Miquiztli closes with Manuel
Morales' superb Amistadcs
Ad ve nt istas ("Adventist
Friendships"), which gains in
lucidness by cleaving to the child's
perspective. No excerpt can
convey this simple, finely paced
story.
Unwed Mother
A boy and his sister come to
know Magdalena, an unwed
mother who lives in their
basement, and her daughter
Rosario. Within a pervasive
atmosphere of Catholicism, small
deflections occur in the
experience of the children: the
sister hears about the cannibalism
of the Eucharist, a Gypsy family
settles nearby ("I don't think they
have a religion").
Gradually Magdalena and
Rosario drift away from
Catholicism and become baptized
as Seventh-Day Adventists. One
day the brother and sister sneak
downstairs, and Rosario tells them
about the Great Disappointment,
when Jesus failed to come, and

says there are 350,000 believers
"in the U.S. and Canada." With
the advent of this Protestant,
North American faith, the
friendship cordially dissolves.
"Afterwards, we never saw them."
Contrast these stories about
the dorm, the home, the family,
with prose published recently in
Stanford's literary magazine.
Sequoia contained fiction about a
fat widow "eating herself into the
grave" on nothing but candy;
about a man who lives in dog shit
until his 14 animals eat up his
body and leave the smiling head;
about a girl carefully watching a
beetle; and about fantastic drag
queens in San Francisco. These
may be valuably and skillfully
imagined, but they do fetch to the
extremes of human experience in
search of a subject.
Search Deeply
The writers in Miquiztli,
holding to circumstances and

emotions that touch them
directly, still search deeply into
their lives. A matrix of
contradictory values emerges from
the images of woman and man
that chicanos grow up with. We
see others cooking and nurturing,
recalling the past, perpetuating
legends, attending Mass; we see
fathers working in the world,
standing for strength and pride,
absent from Church or the home.
The stories test these values
without trying to harmonize
them.
Radical analysis and polemic,
as such, aren't evident here,
though not because Mexicans in
this country are now confidently
dreaming the American Dream.
Political critique is needed, but it
seldom takes its bearings from the
individual sensibility. This
collection shows the durable and
no less political act of the creative
writer.

Childhood Stories
The more developed pieces
deal with childhood. Caroline
Castillo's Chavalitas Mocosas
("Snotty-Nosed Little Girls")
opens with the narrator's daddy
beating her and her sister, after
which mama, smooth and warm
and sweet-smelling, comforts

them. The story is beautifully told
by the child without a trace of
false sentiment or moralizing. It
registers the sisters'
half-perceptions — lovemaking
from the next room ("maybe
she's crying") — and ends as they
find the nerve to get back at their
father for beating them.
Razo's dialogue, indeed the
entire account, is brisk and
convincing.
In La Caza ("The Chase"),
Anna Fisher, in love with a boy
her own age, gets an aunt and
uncle to recount their courtship
back in Mexico. Her aunt was 17,
her uncle 30 — Anna hears him
justify this: "So the man can keep
hold of his wife and teach her.
And since the woman ages quicker
than the man, thirteen years
difference is perfect." Yet it is a
loving marriage, lovingly
recreated.
Miquiztli closes with Manuel
Morales' superb Amistadcs
Ad ve nt istas ("Adventist
Friendships"), which gains in
lucidness by cleaving to the child's
perspective. No excerpt can
convey this simple, finely paced
story.
Unwed Mother
A boy and his sister come to
know Magdalena, an unwed
mother who lives in their
basement, and her daughter
Rosario. Within a pervasive
atmosphere of Catholicism, small
deflections occur in the
experience of the children: the
sister hears about the cannibalism
of the Eucharist, a Gypsy family
settles nearby ("I don't think they
have a religion").
Gradually Magdalena and
Rosario drift away from
Catholicism and become baptized
as Seventh-Day Adventists. One
day the brother and sister sneak
downstairs, and Rosario tells them
about the Great Disappointment,
when Jesus failed to come, and

says there are 350,000 believers
"in the U.S. and Canada." With
the advent of this Protestant,
North American faith, the
friendship cordially dissolves.
"Afterwards, we never saw them."
Contrast these stories about
the dorm, the home, the family,
with prose published recently in
Stanford's literary magazine.
Sequoia contained fiction about a
fat widow "eating herself into the
grave" on nothing but candy;
about a man who lives in dog shit
until his 14 animals eat up his
body and leave the smiling head;
about a girl carefully watching a
beetle; and about fantastic drag
queens in San Francisco. These
may be valuably and skillfully
imagined, but they do fetch to the
extremes of human experience in
search of a subject.
Search Deeply
The writers in Miquiztli,
holding to circumstances and

emotions that touch them
directly, still search deeply into
their lives. A matrix of
contradictory values emerges from
the images of woman and man
that chicanos grow up with. We
see others cooking and nurturing,
recalling the past, perpetuating
legends, attending Mass; we see
fathers working in the world,
standing for strength and pride,
absent from Church or the home.
The stories test these values
without trying to harmonize
them.
Radical analysis and polemic,
as such, aren't evident here,
though not because Mexicans in
this country are now confidently
dreaming the American Dream.
Political critique is needed, but it
seldom takes its bearings from the
individual sensibility. This
collection shows the durable and
no less political act of the creative
writer.
Miquiztli (Mee-Arees-tlee), the
Stanford chicano undergraduate
journal of art and literature, is
being sold on campus for 50
cents. With a revealing
introduction by Arturo Islas, and
six diverse stories by students, it is
unquestionably worth reading.
"For the first time in the
history of the most reputable
private university of the West,"
Islas points out, there has been
enough chicano writing to choose
from.
"The Token," by Josie
Jaramillo, has a white co-ed
complacently befriending a
chicana. Maria fails calculus; then,
to the co-ed's amusement,
doggedly signs up for it again.
Though the narrative gains by
taking both girls viewpoints, the
Anglo seems mechanically
condescending. Maria Melendez'
Raices Cafes con Puntas Gueras
("Brown Roots with Frosted
Tips") deftly mixes one girl's
dislike and envy of her
over-made-up rival.
Curadas, by Jose Razo,
challenges Anglo norms and
restrictions. Curadas are good
times, crazy escapades that "cure"
you, restore your strength. In this
story, some friends from "our
Barrio in the dorm" manage after
a dangerous scuffle to steal a kilo
of marijuana from a "sissy and
kind of dumb" gabacho (North
American), while other freshmen
look on.
Matter-Of-Fact
It ends matter-of-factly on a
note of unresolved ambivalence
over what has happened.
The first issue of Miquiztli
(Fall, 1972) bitterly cited Anglo
emptiness, repression, war. One
essay contrasted Anglo
materialism with chicano culture,
"filled with the wisdom and
mistakes of men as well as the
care and love of women."
Another fantasy had Caucasians
dying out from pollutants that
don't affect colored races. There

convey this simple, finely paced
story.
Unwed Mother
A boy and his sister come to
know Magdalena, an unwed
mother who lives in their
basement, and her daughter
Rosario. Within a pervasive
atmosphere of Catholicism, small
deflections occur in the
experience of the children: the
sister hears about the cannibalism
of the Eucharist, a Gypsy family
settles nearby ("I don't think they
have a religion").
Gradually Magdalena and
Rosario drift away from
Catholicism and become baptized
as Seventh-Day Adventists. One
day the brother and sister sneak
downstairs, and Rosario tells them
about the Great Disappointment,
when Jesus failed to come, and

says there are 350,000 believers
"in the U.S. and Canada." With
the advent of this Protestant,
North American faith, the
friendship cordially dissolves.
"Afterwards, we never saw them."
Contrast these stories about
the dorm, the home, the family,
with prose published recently in
Stanford's literary magazine.
Sequoia contained fiction about a
fat widow "eating herself into the
grave" on nothing but candy;
about a man who lives in dog shit
until his 14 animals eat up his
body and leave the smiling head;
about a girl carefully watching a
beetle; and about fantastic drag
queens in San Francisco. These
may be valuably and skillfully
imagined, but they do fetch to the
extremes of human experience in
search of a subject.
Search Deeply
The writers in Miquiztli,
holding to circumstances and

emotions that touch them
directly, still search deeply into
their lives. A matrix of
contradictory values emerges from
the images of woman and man
that chicanos grow up with. We
see others cooking and nurturing,
recalling the past, perpetuating
legends, attending Mass; we see
fathers working in the world,
standing for strength and pride,
absent from Church or the home.
The stories test these values
without trying to harmonize
them.
Radical analysis and polemic,
as such, aren't evident here,
though not because Mexicans in
this country are now confidently
dreaming the American Dream.
Political critique is needed, but it
seldom takes its bearings from the
individual sensibility. This
collection shows the durable and
no less political act of the creative
writer.
Miquiztli (Mee-Arees-tlee), the
Stanford chicano undergraduate
journal of art and literature, is
being sold on campus for 50
cents. With a revealing
introduction by Arturo Islas, and
six diverse stories by students, it is
unquestionably worth reading.
"For the first time in the
history of the most reputable
private university of the West,"
Islas points out, there has been
enough chicano writing to choose
from.
"The Token," by Josie
Jaramillo, has a white co-ed
complacently befriending a
chicana. Maria fails calculus; then,
to the co-ed's amusement,
doggedly signs up for it again.
Though the narrative gains by
taking both girls viewpoints, the
Anglo seems mechanically
condescending. Maria Melendez'
Raices Cafes con Puntas Gueras
("Brown Roots with Frosted
Tips") deftly mixes one girl's
dislike and envy of her
over-made-up rival.
Curadas, by Jose Razo,
challenges Anglo norms and
restrictions. Curadas are good
times, crazy escapades that "cure"
you, restore your strength. In this
story, some friends from "our
Barrio in the dorm" manage after
a dangerous scuffle to steal a kilo
of marijuana from a "sissy and
kind of dumb" gabacho (North
American), while other freshmen
look on.
Matter-Of-Fact
It ends matter-of-factly on a
note of unresolved ambivalence
over what has happened.
The first issue of Miquiztli
(Fall, 1972) bitterly cited Anglo
emptiness, repression, war. One
essay contrasted Anglo
materialism with chicano culture,
"filled with the wisdom and
mistakes of men as well as the
care and love of women."
Another fantasy had Caucasians
dying out from pollutants that
don't affect colored races. There
was also some satire on chicano
poses and machismo.
The issue just published,
beautifully decorated by Islas and
Jose Padilla with Aztec motifs,
differs essentially from the first,
and not because attitudes have
changed. The fiction here
embodies an alternative vision.
Anglo villains and chicano
victims, pride or self-dividedness,
are not so central to telling the
story as is an open path into and
out of one's self, family, home,
and past.
Childhood Stories
The more developed pieces
deal with childhood. Caroline
Castillo's Chavalitas Mocosas
("Snotty-Nosed Little Girls")
opens with the narrator's daddy
beating her and her sister, after
which mama, smooth and warm
and sweet-smelling, comforts

them. The story is beautifully told
by the child without a trace of
false sentiment or moralizing. It
registers the sisters'
half-perceptions — lovemaking
from the next room ("maybe
she's crying") — and ends as they
find the nerve to get back at their
father for beating them.
Razo's dialogue, indeed the
entire account, is brisk and
convincing.
In La Caza ("The Chase"),
Anna Fisher, in love with a boy
her own age, gets an aunt and
uncle to recount their courtship
back in Mexico. Her aunt was 17,
her uncle 30 — Anna hears him
justify this: "So the man can keep
hold of his wife and teach her.
And since the woman ages quicker
than the man, thirteen years
difference is perfect." Yet it is a
loving marriage, lovingly
recreated.
Miquiztli closes with Manuel
Morales' superb Amistadcs
Ad ve nt istas ("Adventist
Friendships"), which gains in
lucidness by cleaving to the child's
perspective. No excerpt can
convey this simple, finely paced
story.
