# Hutcherson's Good Vibrations Stimulate Audience
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"Outstanding, outstanding," yelled a voice from the
small crowd after Bobby Hutcherson's closing number
Saturday night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Hutcherson's quartet indeed turned out some
outstanding jazz at the Black Students Union-African
Famine Relief show which only half filled the house. This
vvas particularly unfortunate because the music and
dancing presented was unusual and totally different from
the vast majority of campus concerts.
Hutcherson himself proved once again that jazz
musicians, although familiar to only a small musical
audience, are perhaps the finest technical musicians of any
genre. Because the jazz musician must combine style with
instant creativity, no jazz piece can ever really be the same
twice. The audience is always presented with a fresh
creation.
Hutcherson's work on the vibes was so fast that his
hands appeared as two overlapping blurs most of the time.
His notes cascaded over support from Kurt Leipzig on
piano, Henry Franklin on string bass, and Larry Hancock
on drums.
Most of the five piece set was controlled ably by

Hutcherson who set the rhythmic and melodic basis, but
occasional problems developed. Hancock's drums became
overwhelming at what should have been more mellow
points in the set, so that once Hutcherson had to quite
obviously instruct Hancock to quiet down.
On the quartet's third piece, Hancock assumed an
effective role by answering Hutcherson's flurries on the
vibes with echoing patterns on the drums. Hancock also
performed a fine solo during this piece.
The most exciting number was the fourth, a mellow
excursion in which the drums faded to a brushed whisper
and Leipzig performed a lovely piano solo. The end of
the piece provded the only opportunity to hear
Hutcherson without accompaniment.
Hutcherson's notes became a splashing brook with
unpredictable direction, until he settled into a four note
pattern which faded away and became a single tone. This
high vibration continued through the hall, disguising for
awhile the fact that the piece was over.
The Watumbe Dancers directed by Dolores Cayou
began the program with a blend of Afro-Haitian and
modern dance. The five lead dancers performed four
scenes: one African scene, one ghetto scene, one

modernistic scene, and a finale.
Some of the poetry and singing between the actual
dance scenes was great, particularly the male vocalist who
first appeared as Heroin in Overalls. He announced that,
"Fuckin' with me is like running through a lion cage with
a pork chop tied on your ass."
Heroin, after jumping over the railing separating the
stage from the audience and running back and forth
extolling his own evils, leapt back onto the stage and sang
a song, "Ghetto Boy," so beautifully that it was difficult
to believe he was the same person.
The Watumbe Dancers were most enjoyable when they
were the least structured. The ghetto dance and the finale
gave each dancer a change to demonstrate a personal talent
rather than a choreographed one. The individual moves
during these portions of the program were astounding, but
beyond technical excellence they contained the life and
fire that was missing from the stiff, modern ballet
sequence.
The Watumbe Dancers demonstrated some excellent
individual dance, instrumental, and vocal talent which can
become immensely impressive with more effective
planning.
