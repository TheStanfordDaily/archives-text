# Emerson, Lake, And Palmer
## Concert Explores Man And The Machine 
### DOUG ARCHERD SAN FRANCISCO 
"For machines feed the
furnace,
If they take us, they will burn
us.. .
Will you still know who you
are?"
"Knife-Edge" — Keith Emerson
Emerson, Lake, and Palmer,
always in the forefront of the
move to blend traditional musical
forms with rock music, have
begun to explore the Wagnerian
gcsamptkunstwerk, or total work
of art, as shown in their Civic
, Auditorium concert.
The gesampthunstwerk was
invented by Richard Wagner, the
19th century composer. It is a
total work of art, employing all
forms possible in a single
production to express a single
theme. On Sunday, Emerson,
Lake, and Palmer were expressing
the theme of Man and The
Machine.
Everything — the costumes, the
stage setting, the light show, and
of course the music - was

carefully calculated to explore
some aspect of the theme.
The group came on stage after
a long intermission seemingly
caused by many technical
difficulties, which is
understandable considering the
mountains of equipment piled on
the stage. The delay was also
appropriate in view of the theme
of the concert.
They were all wearing
variations of white suits, Emerson
looking like a misplaced hospital
orderly. But when he stepped
inside his arena, surrounded by
various organs, synthesizers, and a
piano, one realized that he was
casting himself as the
white-coated technician, caretaker
for the proto-typical Machine.
Palmer, for his part, was no less
enveloped by equipment. Raised
on a mirrored podium, he had, in
addition to the usual drumer's
equipment: at least eight
tom-toms, tuned to various
pitches and arranged in a
semi-circle in front of him; two
large gongs suspended from an
oriental frame behind him, from
which hung a bell which could be

rung by a cord pulled with his
teeth; as well as tympani and
chimes.
Only Greg Lake, the guitarist
and vocalist, seemed at all human,
his white suit open to the waist.
Since all three of the group are
blond, they looked rather like
white knights. But the minute
they started playing, one realized
that they were actually the little
men in white coats, coming to
take you away.
The emcee announced them as
"The Show That Never Ends,"
and they were off, playing hard,
fast and simple at first, with a
throbbing, incessant beat which
was abandoned only for short
interludes throughout the whole
concert. That beat was yet
another facet of the theme of the
Machine, suggestive of some
mindless technology pounding its
inexorable way to some
meaningless goal.
After a short first piece, they
launched into a song titled
"Jerusalem," sounding like a
hymn, complete with organ and
chimes, a nostalgic link with the
past. Without a break, they
suddenly shifted into the next
song, destroying the previous
mood with a resumption of The
Machine beat, the demonic
throbbing becoming more and
more overpowering until it
culminated in a percussion solo in
quadrophonic sound, the tympani
and gongs being shunted around
the auditorium by speakers placed
in both the front and rear of the
hall.
Emerson flung himself upon
his Moog synthesizer and drew
forth maniacal shrieks and hoots,
while the lights mounted in
Palmer's podium flashed in time
to the drums, and the big screen
overhead displayed one of E.M.
Escher's paradoxical prints. The
whole scene was greeted with
delight by the audience who,
dazzled by the gimmickry, seemed

to miss the message of horror
presented — but maybe that was
also part of the message.
Continuing the theme, they
then played "Tarkus," from the
album of the same name. The
song is in a fast 7/8 time, which
always sounds maddeningly
rushed. Emerson was in fine form,
leaping back and forth from one
keyboard to another. There was
an incident during this piece
which, though unplanned,
contributed beautifully to their
warning on the danger of the
Machine.
Emerson grabbed one of the
synthesizer keyboards, carried it
to the middle of the stage, and
began a slow glissando up the
scale. At the top of the run, a
firecracker exploded from the top
of the keyboard, which was
planned, but Emerson burned his
finger in the process, which was
unplanned. He was sticking the
injured finger in his mouth for the
rest of the evening, but he kept
playing.
The song changed mood as
Lake switched to guitar — he
played bass through most of the
concert — and played a slow,
ethereal solo, finishing on the
high, resonating overtones.
Emerson was back with his
finger attended to, and the beat
returned with him as he sent
sound sailing around the hall with
more quadrophonic gimmickry.
He playfully snuck in a bit of
"Norwegian Wood," then with a
loud buzz, went back to the
original "Tarkus" theme, the
screen showing the half-animal,
half-tank figure from the Tarkus
album cover.
Emerson then moved to the
piano, and after a bawdy ragtime
number, played Lake's "Take a
Pebble," showing off both Lake's
fine vocals and Emerson's piano
skill as he complemented the
vocals with beautiful cascading
arpeggios. The song then speeded
up, becoming a piano solo.
Lake then came on stage with
acoustical guitars, first a 12-string,
then a six-string with which he
sang a very fine version of "Lucky
Man," which satirized modern

values.
Emerson came back to the
piano, playing a free form solo,
and displaying his virtuoso talent.
Some classical musicians believe
Emerson could be a top-flight
classical pianist and is wasting his
talents. While the latter is
debatable, there is no doubt that
Keith Emerson is one of the finest
pianists in any style of music.
He subtly blended styles,
shifting from his own modern
style to ragtime, to rocking blues,
and ending with a Bach-like
counterpoint, then moving back
to "Take a Pebble." Amazingly,
this musical goulash actually
worked, for the shifts were so
subtle and logical, the playing so
clean and precise, that there was
no sense of discontinuity.
The next song, another hard
rocker, featured a showy drum
solo by Palmer which used all the
gimmicks at his disposal: the
quadrophonics, the lights
synchronized with the beats, and
finishing with the podium rotating
360 degrees to a flashing strobe
light. In spite of all the visual
effects, nothing could cover up
the fact that Palmer is easily
Emerson's peer in musical ability.
He is easily one of the finest
drummers in the world.
The final song began with a
sinister opening, combining
unearthly piano chords with an
evil sounding bass. Palmer began
regular taps on the wood blocks
to sound like the ticking of a
clock, and a death's-head on the
screen completed the image.
The beat subtly shifted into a
more joyful mood, and the screen
corresponded by showing a figure
suggestive of a human embryo.
Emerson moved into various
classical themes, expressing the
joy of human existence as
opposed to the sterile
mindlessness of the Machine.
In the finale, the stage went
black, and the huge Moog, which
had been placed sideways to the
audience, rotated to face them,
and flashing lights and colored
screens played across its face with
the speakers blaring a
computerized sound pattern. The

Moog grew wing-like appendages,
and while everyone's attention
was riveted on it, it flashed one
brilliant strobe, leaving everyone
temporarily blinded.
The spotlights came on to
show the group alive and well, and
the audience enthusiastically
GAVE. After five minutes of wild
stomping and cheering, the group
came back and played selections
from their version of Pictures At
An Exhibition.
The end of the encore found
Emerson fighting with one of his
synthesizers, flinging it around,
eliciting groans and shrieks from
it, and finally struggling, nearly
crushed underneath it before
throwing it off with a massive
effort and leaving it wailing on its
side.
The theme of the
gesamptkunstwerk was the idea
that Man must be master of the
Machine, and that if the reverse
becomes true, we will lose our
humanity and become slaves of
the Machine.
Emerson Lake, and Palmer
have been criticized for using
'gimmickry,' and to be sure,
the special effects were there in
abundance. However, they were
not being used for pure
gimmickry's sake, for all were
relevant to the major theme. The
effects were not overused, and
they were placed at points where
they had real meaning.
If the group can be criticized at
all, it would be for their lack of
sponteneity, forevery effect, every
note, every gesture seemed
calculated and rehearsed, even
Emerson's destructive orgy at the
end. The only really spontaneous
moment was when Emerson
burned his finger and one realized
that he was human after all.
But even this criticism is
difficult to make, for they made
no pretense of being a loose, free
bunch of musicians who simply
get up and jam. Emerson, Lake,
and Palmer were putting on a
show with an idea and a message,
and jamming had no part of it.
After all, one does not go to a
Wager opera and expect
ad-libbing.
