# While Stanford Drank, Trojan Strokers Streaked
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
It is indeed fortunate that the earliest settlers
in America were not contemporary Stanford
students. For if they had been, the Western
frontier would have never advanced beyond the
east bank of the Mississippi River. If you doubt
this revisionist speculation, then you've never
seen the Stanford Canoe Team.
Last Thursday, 80-odd Stanford students,
who shared only a common lack of rowing
ability, descended upon Van Nuys for the
second annual, 72-hour "Great Canoe Race"
sponsored by Busch Gardens. When they left five
days later, the Busch employees let out a
collective sigh of relief that could be heard all
the way to Golden, Colorado.
From the outset it was obvious that the USC
and UCLA teams were taking the race a bit more
seriously than their northern counterparts. With
war-like determination that would have made
even John McKay proud, the Trojan strokers
reportedly even held tryouts before the race.
In the end, the tryouts, practice stroking and
unwavering sobriety paid off as the Trojans
completed a record 433 laps, compared to
UCLA's 432 and Stanford's 413. But as all

Philadelphia sports fans know, winning isn't
everything. There is something to be said for
having a good time.
If Stanford had taken things as seriously as
USC, the Cards certainly wouldn't have lacked
alibis for losing. To say the least, the race's
promoters didn't bend over backwards to
accommodate the Card strokers. In fact, they
didn't bend over at all.
Disappearing Food
Promised PSA transportation fell through in
favor of two Greyhound Scenicruisers and an
18-hour round trip. The disappearing plane trick
was topped only by the disappearing food
routine. After withdrawing their free food
promise, the promoters graciously gave team
members tokens so they could eat now and pay
later. A team captain put it succinctly when he
said, "We been pimped."
A threatened strokers' strike never
materialized, but the combination of Denny's,
Taco Bell and Orange Julius was a bit of a
handicap. To top everthing off, the Busch
bartenders tried to limit the free beer, but when
another team captain threatened to have the
strokers streak through the park, the beer flowed

freely.
Because the team was Band-sponsored, race
observers said that everyone expected the Card
canoeists to do something "outrageous." Many
ideas fell short of execution, however, due to
the presence of a large group of Busch security
guards who had obviously watched a few too
many "FBI" episodes.
With prohibitionist zeal, they removed beer
cups from the lips of many an under-age stroke
with all the self-righteousness of Jack Webb.
Getting a beer required almost as much
identification as crossing the Iron Curtain.
By the time Ed "Alpo" McMahon showed up
on Monday to present SC with the
victory paddle, there were almost as many Busch
storm troppers as spectators and the Stanford
team was unable to "persuade" Ed to take an
unscheduled dip in the Busch lagoon.
Illicit Brew
Despite these obstacles, the team elders
obtained and distributed enough illicit brew to
keep most everyone refreshed for the entire trip.
Since it was obvious that they weren't going to
set any rowing records, the SU Strokers zeroed
in successfully on a host of beer-related records.

When the 72 dizzy hours were over, the
Stanford team had smashed all existing Busch
Gardens records for beer-drinking,
toilet-flushing, gorilla-suit wearing,
canoe-ramming and canoe-capsizing.
The Stanford team of Raoul Duke and Nancy
Crawford set a bevy of records during their two
hours of attempted rowing which included:
most beers consumed (18), most beers (7),
most rocks rammed (35) and most consecutive
beers caught after being dropped 40 feet from
the Busch Pavilion (2).
But it was the final Stanford duo of Oak
Cooper and Barbara Brown which set the race's
most controversial record — most laps
completed in a Coors canoe (7.5). Shortly after
the final leg began, a group of masked bandits
removed the gaudy Budweiser canoe Stanford
was rowing in from the water.
When the canoe reentered the water, the Bud
labels had been completely obliterated by two
giant Coors logos. McMahon claimed that the
Coors stood for the "Coalition of Older Racing
Schools," but by then everyone knew who the
real beer connoisseurs in the race were.

The canoe hijackers were also believed
responsible for numerous acts of vandalism,
canoe sabotage, sign-stealing, sign-defacing,
malicious mischief and general rowdyism which
marred the race.
Stanford team captains George Johnson and
Willy Rorke termed these acts "irresponsible and
immature" and added that "those criminal
punks should be taught a lesson." Johnson and
Rorke made the remarks while wearing frogman
suits in front of a sizeable sign which formerly
hung in the Busch Gardens.
Meanwhile back in the water, Cooper and
Brown excelled in the show business tradition
demonstrated by all 36 Card teams. They
paddled at times with a ukelele, wore Groucho
Marx disguises and constantly rammed the SC
canoe.
USC had the biggest trophy, but it was fairly
obvious that Stanford had had the most fun. As
the Cards worried about where they could buy
beer for the trip home, the Trojans and Bruins
were already making plans for next year's race.
In fact the Trojans are probably out rowing right
now with visions of 2000 laps dancing in their
heads. I guess some people never mellow out.

Meanwhile back in the water, Cooper and
Brown excelled in the show business tradition
demonstrated by all 36 Card teams. They
paddled at times with a ukelele, wore Groucho
Marx disguises and constantly rammed the SC
canoe.
USC had the biggest trophy, but it was fairly
obvious that Stanford had had the most fun. As
the Cards worried about where they could buy
beer for the trip home, the Trojans and Bruins
were already making plans for next year's race.
In fact the Trojans are probably out rowing right
now with visions of 2000 laps dancing in their
heads. I guess some people never mellow out.
It is indeed fortunate that the earliest settlers
in America were not contemporary Stanford
students. For if they had been, the Western
frontier would have never advanced beyond the
east bank of the Mississippi River. If you doubt
this revisionist speculation, then you've never
seen the Stanford Canoe Team.
Last Thursday, 80-odd Stanford students,
who shared only a common lack of rowing
ability, descended upon Van Nuys for the
second annual, 72-hour "Great Canoe Race"
sponsored by Busch Gardens. When they left five
days later, the Busch employees let out a
collective sigh of relief that could be heard all
the way to Golden, Colorado.
From the outset it was obvious that the USC
and UCLA teams were taking the race a bit more
seriously than their northern counterparts. With
war-like determination that would have made
even John McKay proud, the Trojan strokers
reportedly even held tryouts before the race.
In the end, the tryouts, practice stroking and
unwavering sobriety paid off as the Trojans
completed a record 433 laps, compared to
UCLA's 432 and Stanford's 413. But as all

Philadelphia sports fans know, winning isn't
everything. There is something to be said for
having a good time.
If Stanford had taken things as seriously as
USC, the Cards certainly wouldn't have lacked
alibis for losing. To say the least, the race's
promoters didn't bend over backwards to
accommodate the Card strokers. In fact, they
didn't bend over at all.
Disappearing Food
Promised PSA transportation fell through in
favor of two Greyhound Scenicruisers and an
18-hour round trip. The disappearing plane trick
was topped only by the disappearing food
routine. After withdrawing their free food
promise, the promoters graciously gave team
members tokens so they could eat now and pay
later. A team captain put it succinctly when he
said, "We been pimped."
A threatened strokers' strike never
materialized, but the combination of Denny's,
Taco Bell and Orange Julius was a bit of a
handicap. To top everthing off, the Busch
bartenders tried to limit the free beer, but when
another team captain threatened to have the
strokers streak through the park, the beer flowed

freely.
Because the team was Band-sponsored, race
observers said that everyone expected the Card
canoeists to do something "outrageous." Many
ideas fell short of execution, however, due to
the presence of a large group of Busch security
guards who had obviously watched a few too
many "FBI" episodes.
With prohibitionist zeal, they removed beer
cups from the lips of many an under-age stroke
with all the self-righteousness of Jack Webb.
Getting a beer required almost as much
identification as crossing the Iron Curtain.
By the time Ed "Alpo" McMahon showed up
on Monday to present SC with the
victory paddle, there were almost as many Busch
storm troppers as spectators and the Stanford
team was unable to "persuade" Ed to take an
unscheduled dip in the Busch lagoon.
Illicit Brew
Despite these obstacles, the team elders
obtained and distributed enough illicit brew to
keep most everyone refreshed for the entire trip.
Since it was obvious that they weren't going to
set any rowing records, the SU Strokers zeroed
in successfully on a host of beer-related records.

When the 72 dizzy hours were over, the
Stanford team had smashed all existing Busch
Gardens records for beer-drinking,
toilet-flushing, gorilla-suit wearing,
canoe-ramming and canoe-capsizing.
The Stanford team of Raoul Duke and Nancy
Crawford set a bevy of records during their two
hours of attempted rowing which included:
most beers consumed (18), most beers (7),
most rocks rammed (35) and most consecutive
beers caught after being dropped 40 feet from
the Busch Pavilion (2).
But it was the final Stanford duo of Oak
Cooper and Barbara Brown which set the race's
most controversial record — most laps
completed in a Coors canoe (7.5). Shortly after
the final leg began, a group of masked bandits
removed the gaudy Budweiser canoe Stanford
was rowing in from the water.
When the canoe reentered the water, the Bud
labels had been completely obliterated by two
giant Coors logos. McMahon claimed that the
Coors stood for the "Coalition of Older Racing
Schools," but by then everyone knew who the
real beer connoisseurs in the race were.

The canoe hijackers were also believed
responsible for numerous acts of vandalism,
canoe sabotage, sign-stealing, sign-defacing,
malicious mischief and general rowdyism which
marred the race.
Stanford team captains George Johnson and
Willy Rorke termed these acts "irresponsible and
immature" and added that "those criminal
punks should be taught a lesson." Johnson and
Rorke made the remarks while wearing frogman
suits in front of a sizeable sign which formerly
hung in the Busch Gardens.

Coors stood for the "Coalition of Older Racing
Schools," but by then everyone knew who the
real beer connoisseurs in the race were.

The canoe hijackers were also believed
responsible for numerous acts of vandalism,
canoe sabotage, sign-stealing, sign-defacing,
malicious mischief and general rowdyism which
marred the race.
Stanford team captains George Johnson and
Willy Rorke termed these acts "irresponsible and
immature" and added that "those criminal
punks should be taught a lesson." Johnson and
Rorke made the remarks while wearing frogman
suits in front of a sizeable sign which formerly
hung in the Busch Gardens.
Meanwhile back in the water, Cooper and
Brown excelled in the show business tradition
demonstrated by all 36 Card teams. They
paddled at times with a ukelele, wore Groucho
Marx disguises and constantly rammed the SC
canoe.
USC had the biggest trophy, but it was fairly
obvious that Stanford had had the most fun. As
the Cards worried about where they could buy
beer for the trip home, the Trojans and Bruins
were already making plans for next year's race.
In fact the Trojans are probably out rowing right
now with visions of 2000 laps dancing in their
heads. I guess some people never mellow out.
It is indeed fortunate that the earliest settlers
in America were not contemporary Stanford
students. For if they had been, the Western
frontier would have never advanced beyond the
east bank of the Mississippi River. If you doubt
this revisionist speculation, then you've never
seen the Stanford Canoe Team.
Last Thursday, 80-odd Stanford students,
who shared only a common lack of rowing
ability, descended upon Van Nuys for the
second annual, 72-hour "Great Canoe Race"
sponsored by Busch Gardens. When they left five
days later, the Busch employees let out a
collective sigh of relief that could be heard all
the way to Golden, Colorado.
From the outset it was obvious that the USC
and UCLA teams were taking the race a bit more
seriously than their northern counterparts. With
war-like determination that would have made
even John McKay proud, the Trojan strokers
reportedly even held tryouts before the race.
In the end, the tryouts, practice stroking and
unwavering sobriety paid off as the Trojans
completed a record 433 laps, compared to
UCLA's 432 and Stanford's 413. But as all

Philadelphia sports fans know, winning isn't
everything. There is something to be said for
having a good time.
If Stanford had taken things as seriously as
USC, the Cards certainly wouldn't have lacked
alibis for losing. To say the least, the race's
promoters didn't bend over backwards to
accommodate the Card strokers. In fact, they
didn't bend over at all.
Disappearing Food
Promised PSA transportation fell through in
favor of two Greyhound Scenicruisers and an
18-hour round trip. The disappearing plane trick
was topped only by the disappearing food
routine. After withdrawing their free food
promise, the promoters graciously gave team
members tokens so they could eat now and pay
later. A team captain put it succinctly when he
said, "We been pimped."
A threatened strokers' strike never
materialized, but the combination of Denny's,
Taco Bell and Orange Julius was a bit of a
handicap. To top everthing off, the Busch
bartenders tried to limit the free beer, but when
another team captain threatened to have the
strokers streak through the park, the beer flowed

freely.
Because the team was Band-sponsored, race
observers said that everyone expected the Card
canoeists to do something "outrageous." Many
ideas fell short of execution, however, due to
the presence of a large group of Busch security
guards who had obviously watched a few too
many "FBI" episodes.
With prohibitionist zeal, they removed beer
cups from the lips of many an under-age stroke
with all the self-righteousness of Jack Webb.
Getting a beer required almost as much
identification as crossing the Iron Curtain.
By the time Ed "Alpo" McMahon showed up
on Monday to present SC with the
victory paddle, there were almost as many Busch
storm troppers as spectators and the Stanford
team was unable to "persuade" Ed to take an
unscheduled dip in the Busch lagoon.
Illicit Brew
Despite these obstacles, the team elders
obtained and distributed enough illicit brew to
keep most everyone refreshed for the entire trip.
Since it was obvious that they weren't going to
set any rowing records, the SU Strokers zeroed
in successfully on a host of beer-related records.

When the 72 dizzy hours were over, the
Stanford team had smashed all existing Busch
Gardens records for beer-drinking,
toilet-flushing, gorilla-suit wearing,
canoe-ramming and canoe-capsizing.
The Stanford team of Raoul Duke and Nancy
Crawford set a bevy of records during their two
hours of attempted rowing which included:
most beers consumed (18), most beers (7),
most rocks rammed (35) and most consecutive
beers caught after being dropped 40 feet from
the Busch Pavilion (2).
But it was the final Stanford duo of Oak
Cooper and Barbara Brown which set the race's
most controversial record — most laps
completed in a Coors canoe (7.5). Shortly after
the final leg began, a group of masked bandits
removed the gaudy Budweiser canoe Stanford
was rowing in from the water.
When the canoe reentered the water, the Bud
labels had been completely obliterated by two
giant Coors logos. McMahon claimed that the
Coors stood for the "Coalition of Older Racing
Schools," but by then everyone knew who the
real beer connoisseurs in the race were.
