# University Libraries Face Space Shortage
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
The Stanford University libraries,
with nearly four million volumes and
serials, currently faces a very serious
"space crunch." If volumes continue
to be added at the present rate, the
Main Library will officially run out of
shelving and storage space on Jan. 1,
1976, and the Meyer Library will be in
grave trouble, according to John
Heyeck, libraries financial and
planning officer.
The Main Library continues to add
more books each year than the total
number Meyer has on its shelves.
Barring storage in tucked away Quad
closets or unused Stern Hall rooms,
the Stanford faculty and students'
"precious research tools" are in a
precarious situation not unlike that of
students in the spring housing draw.
If a substantial facility is not built
to house the libraries' research
acquisitions, the only solutions to this
storage problem are temporary,
according to Heyeck and Ed Shaw,
executive assistant to the vice
president and provost in charge of
planning.
These measures include book
storage in which the Lane Medical
School already houses books; use of
the old law library, when that facility
is vacated on completion of the new
law complex; or even remote storage
off campus for less frequently
requested books (a system used at
UC-Berkeley). These are stop-gap since
they would decentralize a research
facility which is valuable in large part
because of its interdisciplinary
centralization.
Libraries Near Capacity
Administrators claim that large
amounts of research materials close at
hand on the main campus attract both
potential faculty interested in
furthering their research while
teaching, and established faculty who
have found these materials valuable in
the past. Students can locate
enormous amounts of material for
research papers and special projects.
But the stacks and reference rooms
in the Main Library are stocked full
with special collections of books like

those in the Bender Room, the Felton
Room, the University Archives, and
the Robinson collection tucked away
in the far upper reaches of the library.
The nooks and crannies of the library
system have nearly reached their
capacity.
Top priority, in the $300 million
Campaign for Stanford, goes to the
construction of a large research library
on and extending beneath the parking
lot behind the Main Library, which
would attach to both that building,
and to the Meyer basement stacks via
tunnels. But the dependence on gifts
so far has not provided enough money
to begin construction of the $28
million five level facility, and costs rise
at the rate of $250,000 a month.
Completion would take at least three
years, according to Shaw, so "We're
bound to run into a crunch even if we
start building now."
Even after completion, with 64
miles of new shelves, the libraries
would still face a space problem in the
more distant future, but by then
microfilming and computerized
cataloguing should diminish the need
for shelving space, according to Shaw.
Why all the book-buying if there is
no storage space? According to
Heyeck, books are purchased now

because they will be more expensive if
purchased later.
For any first printing of a book,
Heyeck says, "If you can't buy it now
you have to buy it in reprints" and
reprint prices have a "tendency to
skyrocket." Inflation and the
unpredictability of the publishing
industry have caused library planners
to estimate an annual cost increase of
12 percent in material expenditures,
although the amount of books and
serials purchased stays about the same.
In recent years, claim library
officials, the money problem has
become increasingly more severe.
Although the libraries are, and have
been, high priority items in the
University budget, according to
Heyeck, they are "heavily dependent
on general funds support, so if the
University has financial problems,
we'll have problems too."

These general funds account for
over three-fourths of Stanford library
financial resources. Endowed book
funds take care of almost 12 percent,
while the gift portion is less than five
percent.
Part of the reason for this low
percentage of donations is the
tendency of alumni to grant money to
a specific department or to the school
in general, rather than to the library.
The Associates of the Stanford
University Libraries, a fund raising
organization, is trying to curb the
deficiency of library funds. Mike Burd,
senior majoring in history and a
student member of the group, stated
two reasons for the need of student
concern. "An increased awareness of
the library will improve the Stanford
experience... in order to have a
strong base [for gifts) among alumni,
they need to have the idea that the
libraries are important."
Study Library
Burd feels that making students
aware of the importance of the
libraries now will be some insurance of
future alumni support.
"Since UGLY's been in existence,
people tend to forget that other
libraries do exist," he says.
Meyer itself was not built to
accommodate the concentrated book
storage that a research library would
need, according to Heyeck. It was
designed as a reading and study
library, to supplement the "no longer
sufficient" study areas in the Main
Library, rather than house an
extensive research collection.
Although certain planners have
facetiously suggested filling Meyer's
three-story "well" with stacks, the
data has, for some time, indicated the
need for an additional large research
library facility.
