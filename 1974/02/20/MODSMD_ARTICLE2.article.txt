# University Libraries Face Space Shortage
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
The Stanford University libraries,
with nearly four million volumes and
serials, currently faces a very serious
"space crunch." If volumes continue
to be added at the present rate, the
Main Library will officially run out of
shelving and storage space on Jan. 1,
1976, and the Meyer Library will be in
grave trouble, according to John
Heyeck, libraries financial and
planning officer.
The Main Library continues to add
more books each year than the total
number Meyer has on its shelves.
Barring storage in tucked away Quad
closets or unused Stern Hall rooms,
the Stanford faculty and students'
"precious research tools" are in a
precarious situation not unlike that of
students in the spring housing draw.
If a substantial facility is not built
to house the libraries' research
acquisitions, the only solutions to this
storage problem are temporary,
according to Heyeck and Ed Shaw,
executive assistant to the vice
president and provost in charge of
planning.
These measures include book
storage in which the Lane Medical
School already houses books; use of
the old law library, when that facility
is vacated on completion of the new
law complex; or even remote storage
off campus for less frequently
requested books (a system used at
UC-Berkeley). These are stop-gap since
they would decentralize a research
facility which is valuable in large part
because of its interdisciplinary
centralization.
Libraries Near Capacity
Administrators claim that large
amounts of research materials close at
hand on the main campus attract both
potential faculty interested in
furthering their research while
teaching, and established faculty who
have found these materials valuable in
the past. Students can locate
enormous amounts of material for
research papers and special projects.
But the stacks and reference rooms
in the Main Library are stocked full
with special collections of books like

those in the Bender Room, the Felton
Room, the University Archives, and
the Robinson collection tucked away
in the far upper reaches of the library.
The nooks and crannies of the library
system have nearly reached their
capacity.
Top priority, in the $300 million
Campaign for Stanford, goes to the
construction of a large research library
on and extending beneath the parking
