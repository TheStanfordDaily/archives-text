# Runnerup Hopes Dashed
## Curious Cards Return Home 
### PETE BHATIA 
SEATTLE - The Stanford
Cardinals' weekend in Washington
was curious and disappointing —
and unfortunately typical of the
Cards' season.
Saturday the Cards ripped the
nets at a 52 percent clip, limited
Washington State's high-scoring
duo of Norton Barnhill and Steve
Puidokas to 19 points and ran a
potent fast-breaking offense. The
result was a 72-51 rout over the
Cougars.
Monday night, against a Husky
team they had trounced 88-68 a
week earlier, the Cards shot 36
percent, were slow on defense and
didn't run. They lost 84-70.
It was two different Stanford
teams that played Saturday and
Monday. Saturday's victory was
the Cards' fifth in a row,
establishing Stanford as a solid
contender for the conference
runnerup spot. The Cards were
running, passing crisply, taking
good shots and penetrating well.
Rich Kelley and Ed Schweitzer
had free reign underneath and
combined for 37 points and 22
rebounds.
Cards Of Old
But Monday it was the Cards
of old — the same team that lost

six straight in January. Nineteen
worthless turnovers and the
red-hot shooting of the Huskies'
Clarence Ramsey and Ray Price
virtually eliminated any chance
for the runnerup spot and
returned Stanford's record to a
dismal 10-10.
Kelley and Schweitzer couldn't
control the boards against the
aggressive Huskies and Washington
was content to let the Cards bomb
away from the 20-foot range.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the
shots weren't dropping. And the
Cards' 1-2-2 zone and man-to-man
defenses didn't react quickly
enough to contain the hot Husky
shooters.
Besides Kelley, the only
consistent performer for the Cards
in both games was forward Scott
Trobbe. Trobbe, basically
Stanford's sixth man this season,
broke out of a lengthy slump with
17 points and several assists for
the weekend.
Players Frustrated
The weekend was particularly
frustrating for the players.
Schweitzer sees the difference
between Saturday and Monday as
both physical and mental.
"Monday we were really
sluggish," he said. "We just

weren't moving as quickly on our
zone defense and we weren't
shooting as well. We were standing
around. I was really tired from the
trip by Monday night."
Guard Mike Simons concurred
with Schweitzer and added, "Our
man offense was terrible. We're
standing too much. We weren't
getting any [fast] breaks. We
weren't looking to run."
