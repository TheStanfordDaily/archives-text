DOUBLE PLAY ATTEMPT — Stanford shortstop Steve Davis (13) makes the pivot at second base
yesterday as the Cards attempt to double up a pair of Santa Clara baserunners. Stanford jumped out to an
early 7-2 lead against the Broncos, but Santa Clara scored eight runs in a disastrous sixth inning and
eventually recorded a 10-7 victory. Stanford is now 2-5 on the season.
