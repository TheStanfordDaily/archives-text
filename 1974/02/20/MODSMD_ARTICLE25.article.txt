# Broncos Trip Cards In Sixth
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
As has been the script in this
early season, Stanford's baseball
team built an early lead and then
faltered. This time the pitching
failed in a 10-7 loss to Santa Clara
yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinals (2-5) travel to
Fresno State this Friday for a
three-game series.
Stanford jumped out to a 4-0
lead after three innings yesterday
on the clutch hitting of Dave
Baker and Mark Lucich. The
margin grew to 7-2 after five but
then the downfall hit Stanford in
the sixth — because of faulty
pitching.
Four Cardinal pitchers —
Bernie Hittner, freshman John
Yandle (the losing pitcher), Kent
Caldwell and Max Goldstein
allowed eight runs in the fateful
inning. Those runs were a result of
six walks, an error and just two
Santa Clara hits. The winning
blow for the Broncos was a
two-run double by Gene Delyon.
In that frustrating inning for
the Card hurlers 40 balls and 15
strikes were thrown.
Santa Clara 110 008 000— 10 SO
Stanford 202 300 000— 79 2
