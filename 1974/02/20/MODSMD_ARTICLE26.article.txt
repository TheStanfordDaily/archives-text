Hearst Announces Food Program
HILLSBOROUGH - Randolph A. Hearst announced the
creation of a "people-in-need" organization yesterday to set
up a $2 million food giveaway program he hopes will
eventually win his kidnaped daughter's freedom.
"With the $2 million we can feed 100,000 in 12
months," Hearst said on the day before daughter Patricia's
20th birthday.
Appearing with Hearst at a news conference at his home
last night was A. Ludlow Kramer, secretary of state for
Washington State. Kramer was picked by Hearst to
administer the food giveaway.
Hearst said the model of the program "has been done in
Washington .. . it's possible for it to become an ongoing
program."
Kramer said that starting today he planned to pin down
where food outlets would be, what trucks would be
available to carry the food. He said he hoped for more than
1000 volunteers to help the program get started.
Kissinger To Return To Mideast
Gunfire exploded along the Golan Heights cease-fire line
yesterday, as President Nixon announced he was sending
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to the Mideast again
to begin disengagement talks with Syria and Israel.
The military command in Tel Aviv said Israeli and Syrian
forces traded light weapons and recoilless rifle fire near Bet
Jon in the northern Golan sector. The Syrian command said
its forces clashed twice with the Israelis, "and the enemy
was seen evacuating casualties." The Tel Aviv command
reported no casualties.
In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan announced
he will refuse to join the next Israeli government because of
criticism within his dominant Labor party of his handling
of the October war.
Simon Revises Oil Allocations
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office yesterday
ordered an emergency injection of some 1.6 million barrels
of gasoline into 18 shortage-stricken states.
Energy office spokesmen said the action was designed to
share the nation's gasoline more equitably and promised to
re-evaluate gasoline allocations again next month to make
sure that all areas receive about the same portion of
gasoline, based on 1972 consumption.
There is no exact measure of the shortage for each state,
but the national average is thought to be in the
neighborhood of 85 percent of 1972 consumption. The
energy office said it would have exact figures later in the

The extra 1.6 million barrels — 67.2 million gallons —
will come from oil company inventories and is to be a
one-time action to ease critical shortages until a more
equitable allocation plan can be put into effect, the energy
office said.
Public Watergate Hearings End
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate committee
voted yesterday to finish its investigation without further
public hearings.
In announcing the 6-1 vote, chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr.,
D-N.C., said members of the panel felt they "should be
careful not to interfere unduly with the ongoing
impeachment process of the House Judiciary committee or
the criminal cases which will soon be prosecuted by the
special prosecutor . .
In a related development yesterday, a federal judge also
moved to squelch continued public speculation about the
work of the technical experts examining the subpoenaed
Watergate tapes.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica imposed the rule after
a closed-door meeting with attorneys from the White
House, the special prosecutor's office and counsel for Rose
Mary Woods, President Nixon's personal secretary.
Contempt Ruling In Chino Trial
LOS ANGELES — Two San Francisco Bay area women
who refused to testify at the Chino prison escape trial were
given open-end contempt of court terms yesterday.
Superior Court Judge Charles C. Stratton stayed the
contempt sentences of Sylvia Stead and Lora Taulbee until
Monday while they file appeals. If their appeals are not
successful by Monday, they will go to jail until they agree
to answer the prosecutor's questions, the judge ruled.
Attorney Ann Cumings, who represents the women, has
asked that the prosecution's subpoenas against them be
quashed, contending authorities obtained some information
about them through illegal wire taps.
On trial are Jean Hobson, 46, and Robert Seabock, 22,
both of Palo Alto, accused of murder in connection with
the killing of a Chino prison guard during an ambush-escape
Oct. 6, 1972. Ronald Beaty, 35, was freed from custody
during the ambush. He later was recaptured in the San
Francisco area with Hobson.

who refused to testify at the Chino prison escape trial were
given open-end contempt of court terms yesterday.

reported no casualties.

Simon Revises Oil Allocations
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Office yesterday
ordered an emergency injection of some 1.6 million barrels
of gasoline into 18 shortage-stricken states.
Energy office spokesmen said the action was designed to
share the nation's gasoline more equitably and promised to
re-evaluate gasoline allocations again next month to make
sure that all areas receive about the same portion of
gasoline, based on 1972 consumption.
There is no exact measure of the shortage for each state,
but the national average is thought to be in the
neighborhood of 85 percent of 1972 consumption. The
energy office said it would have exact figures later in the

The extra 1.6 million barrels — 67.2 million gallons —
will come from oil company inventories and is to be a
one-time action to ease critical shortages until a more
equitable allocation plan can be put into effect, the energy
office said.
Public Watergate Hearings End
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate committee
voted yesterday to finish its investigation without further
public hearings.
In announcing the 6-1 vote, chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr.,
D-N.C., said members of the panel felt they "should be
careful not to interfere unduly with the ongoing
impeachment process of the House Judiciary committee or
the criminal cases which will soon be prosecuted by the
special prosecutor . .
In a related development yesterday, a federal judge also
moved to squelch continued public speculation about the
work of the technical experts examining the subpoenaed
Watergate tapes.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica imposed the rule after
a closed-door meeting with attorneys from the White
House, the special prosecutor's office and counsel for Rose
Mary Woods, President Nixon's personal secretary.
Contempt Ruling In Chino Trial
LOS ANGELES — Two San Francisco Bay area women
who refused to testify at the Chino prison escape trial were
given open-end contempt of court terms yesterday.
Superior Court Judge Charles C. Stratton stayed the
contempt sentences of Sylvia Stead and Lora Taulbee until
Monday while they file appeals. If their appeals are not
successful by Monday, they will go to jail until they agree
to answer the prosecutor's questions, the judge ruled.
Attorney Ann Cumings, who represents the women, has
asked that the prosecution's subpoenas against them be
quashed, contending authorities obtained some information
about them through illegal wire taps.
On trial are Jean Hobson, 46, and Robert Seabock, 22,
both of Palo Alto, accused of murder in connection with
the killing of a Chino prison guard during an ambush-escape
Oct. 6, 1972. Ronald Beaty, 35, was freed from custody
during the ambush. He later was recaptured in the San
Francisco area with Hobson.
