# New Theme Houses Proposed
## 
### JOHN FREED 
New theme house proposals for
next year include one for a coed
fraternity that would be outside the
normal University-wide housing draw.
The final decision on the proposal,
which will be made within four weeks
according to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton, could
authorize a coed fraternity with the
same rights as all-male frats.
"We have a proposal for a coed
fraternity . . . with all the rights and
privileges which have previously been
held only by all-male fraternities,"
Horton stated.
The proposal, if approved, would
have far-reaching effects, Horton
theorized.
"It sounds like a simple matter, but
it's not. What we do for one house we
have to do for others of a similar kind.
To do that would take a number of
houses out of the housing draw. This
would diminish the chances of other
students to get into University housing
the following year," Horton
contended.
But it would be difficult for the
administration to refuse the request,
he added.
"To deny the proposal would
indicate that the University is
distinguishing this group from others
solely on the basis of sex. It does
appear to me that distinctions on the
basis of sex are difficult, if not
downright impossible, to maintain,"
Horton concluded.
Horton explained the actual
decision-making process that the
proposal must go through.
"We have an advisory committee of
faculty and students," Horton said. "I
make the presentation of the
proposals, and the ultimate
decision ... | is ] made by the dean."

Horton has also received proposals
for a Jewish cultural theme house, a
Russian house, and a slight change in
Junipero, the Asian-American theme
house.
"I have four proposals in but I'm
expecting a couple of others," Horton
said yesterday without elaboration.
The deadline for proposals was Friday.
Sponsors of the Jewish cultural
house say that the house would be
open to all students, offering "the
opportunity to experience a wide
variety of Jewish approaches to life."

The authors say the theme house
would add to the "ecumenical
quality" of higher education, which
Pres. Richard Lyman has lauded in A
Stanford Education.
Horton said that proposed changes
in Junipero, if enacted, would be
minor. "We have a proposal for a
modification in Junipero which seems
very modest," Horton noted.
Horton had no information on the
Russian theme house, and is keeping
the identity of its sponsors
confidential.
