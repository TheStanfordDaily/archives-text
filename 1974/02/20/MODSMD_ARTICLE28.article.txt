# ASSU Investigation
## Commissioner Probed 
### 
The ASSU Senate voted last
evening to investigate "serious
charges" against Elections
Commissioner Richard Haskell. The
Rules Committee will conduct the
investigation into charges that Haskell
has been "irresponsible and abusive of
his position as commissioner."
The charges of misconduct were
contained in a resolution submitted to
the Senate by Michael Amylon.
Amvlon said that Haskell had made
"inappropriate comments" about the
value of holding the recent ASSU
referendum on the Emeritus Housing
Project.
Amylon said that Haskell "was not
in a position to offer comments on the
number of votes versus the cost of the
election." These comments, Amylon
said, "should have been made before
the Senate and not in the Daily."
Haskell told the Senate that he
remembered telling the Daily the day
before the election that he expected
low voter turnout, and that he had

attributed the high turnout later to
"last-minute vote-getting." He denied
wrong-doing. "I think 1 have a right to
my opinions even though I'm election
commissioner," Haskell said.
Amylon's resolution charged that
the wording of the ballot was
confusing "and may have resulted in
misrepresented votes." Amy lon said
that voters were first asked to "oppose
or support" the housing project, and
then elsewhere on the ballot to "reject
or accept" it.
Haskell replied that he had noticed
this printing error and had given
directions for it to be corrected. When
the ballots were later printed, without
the correction, he had correction slips
distributed with the ballots, he said.
The resolution to investigate the
charges was adopted by a vote of 6 to
5. The Rules Committee is expected to
report to the Senate at its regular
meeting in two weeks and to
recommend whether or not Haskell
should be removed from office.
