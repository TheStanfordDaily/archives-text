## Watch Out For Power, Journalists Warn 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Two journalists, working worlds
apart from each other, yesterday
warned a communication class that
journalism must carefully watch those
who govern and mold opinion in the
United States.
Howard Simons, managing editor of
the Washington Post, was talking
about politicians. Marilyn Beck,
Hollywood syndicated columnist, was
talking about movie stars.
Speaking to an overflow crowd of
150 in Redwood Hall, Simons
admitted that news media "catch
history on the run. Nonetheless,
without what we do, the citizen-voter
cannot intervene in the processes that
determine his or her livelihood and his
or her life."
Simons focused on Watergate when
he made his remarks. But Beck, while
claiming that she favored Richard
Nixon's impeachment, saw a threat in

the opposite direction. "It bothers me
to have | Bud | Yorkin and [Norman |
Lear (television producers of All in the
Family, Maude, and Sanford and Son |
indicting Richard Nixon in front of
250 million people a week," she told
the group.
Simons, while vigorously defending
freedom of the press, said that
Watergate has created attitudes in the
media that will be destructive if
unchecked.
Overreaction To Watergate
"The media is danger of
overreacting," he warned. He said he
feared "every political campaign in
America this off-election year will be
subjected to such microscopic
scandal-churning scrutiny that we'll
miss more than we hit."
Simons compared Watergate to "a
kind of bloody body in the
water... an invitation to a shark
frenzy during which reporters will take

bites of the body and rather than
carefully chew them over, swallow the
bites whole.
"Some of this has already happened
resulting in some loss of credibility as
the press has had to correct, retract,
refine and recoup," he went on.
Simons also criticized the new
popularity of investigative reporting
among young journalists: "Not
everyone can be an investigative
reporter, and newspapers have other
roles."
Entertainment Coverage Important
Beck, whose column on Hollywood
is distributed to hundreds of
newspapers, insisted that regular
journalistic coverage of the
entertainment industry was just as
important as political reporting.
"When we sit down and hear a
political personage, we expect to hear
one side of a story .. . when we turn
on television to be entertained, we're
totally vulnerable," she cautioned.
"They I prominent entertainers] wield
important power, and there should be
journalists acting as watchdogs over
the industry.
"You wouldn't believe some of the
mail that Chad Everett of Medical
Center gets. People really think he can
handle their medical problems," Beck
continued.
Readers Prefer 'News' Style
She said she never uses "is it true?"
items in her column. "If you don't
know that it's true what the hell are
you wasting newspaper space asking
your readers for?" Beck said.
She also claimed reading audiences
prefer her style of "news coverage" to
the old Louella Parsons approach to
Hollywood columns.
"People are no longer interested in
who's doing what to whom, because
frankly, who the hell isn't today?"
Beck told an amused audience.

150 in Redwood Hall, Simons
admitted that news media "catch
history on the run. Nonetheless,
without what we do, the citizen-voter
cannot intervene in the processes that
determine his or her livelihood and his
or her life."
Simons focused on Watergate when
he made his remarks. But Beck, while
claiming that she favored Richard
Nixon's impeachment, saw a threat in

the opposite direction. "It bothers me
to have | Bud | Yorkin and [Norman |
Lear (television producers of All in the
Family, Maude, and Sanford and Son |
indicting Richard Nixon in front of
250 million people a week," she told
the group.
Simons, while vigorously defending
freedom of the press, said that
Watergate has created attitudes in the
media that will be destructive if
unchecked.
Overreaction To Watergate
"The media is danger of
overreacting," he warned. He said he
feared "every political campaign in
America this off-election year will be
subjected to such microscopic
scandal-churning scrutiny that we'll
miss more than we hit."
Simons compared Watergate to "a
kind of bloody body in the
water... an invitation to a shark
frenzy during which reporters will take

bites of the body and rather than
carefully chew them over, swallow the
bites whole.
"Some of this has already happened
resulting in some loss of credibility as
the press has had to correct, retract,
refine and recoup," he went on.
Simons also criticized the new
popularity of investigative reporting
among young journalists: "Not
everyone can be an investigative
reporter, and newspapers have other
roles."
Entertainment Coverage Important
Beck, whose column on Hollywood
is distributed to hundreds of
newspapers, insisted that regular
journalistic coverage of the
entertainment industry was just as
important as political reporting.
"When we sit down and hear a
political personage, we expect to hear
one side of a story .. . when we turn
on television to be entertained, we're
totally vulnerable," she cautioned.
"They I prominent entertainers] wield
important power, and there should be
journalists acting as watchdogs over
the industry.
"You wouldn't believe some of the
mail that Chad Everett of Medical
Center gets. People really think he can
handle their medical problems," Beck
continued.
Readers Prefer 'News' Style
She said she never uses "is it true?"
items in her column. "If you don't
know that it's true what the hell are
you wasting newspaper space asking
your readers for?" Beck said.
She also claimed reading audiences
prefer her style of "news coverage" to
the old Louella Parsons approach to
Hollywood columns.
"People are no longer interested in
who's doing what to whom, because
frankly, who the hell isn't today?"
Beck told an amused audience.
Two journalists, working worlds
apart from each other, yesterday
warned a communication class that
journalism must carefully watch those
who govern and mold opinion in the
United States.
