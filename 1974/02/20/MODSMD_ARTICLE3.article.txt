# Ignores Veto Threat
## Senate Passes Energy Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Ignoring
the threat of a presidential veto, the
Senate yesterday passed and sent to
the House emergency energy
legislation providing for an oil price
rollback.
The bill that would give President
Nixon power to order gasoline
rationing passed by a two-to-one
margin after the Senate had rejected
an administration-backed attempt to
send the bill back to conference with
the House.
Shortly before the vote, federal
energy chief William E. Simon sent a
letter to Senate Minority Leader Hugh
Scott warning that the President
would veto the bill in its present form.
Senate Interior Committee
Chairman Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
claims the rollback could result in a
five cent per-gallon drop in the pump
price of gasoline and could save the
consumer $20 million a day.
Destroy Incentives
Opponents say the rollback would
destroy the oil companies' incentives
to expand production.
The controversy over oil prices
shifts to the House Rules Committee.
Since the rollback was not
contained in the bill originally passed
by the House, the Rules Committee
now must decide whether to waive the
parliamentary points of order certain
to be raised by representatives from
oil-producing states. Previous attempts
to grant the bill such a waiver have
failed on a 7 to 7 tie vote.
After the vote, Jackson said he was

confident the Senate could override
the presidential veto promised by
federal energy chief William E. Simon
in a letter to Minority Leader Hugh
Scott. However, he added he could not
predict what would happen in the
House.
The emergency bill, which was first
introduced by Jackson in October, has
failed in two previous attempts to gain
Senate passage.
An administration-backed filibuster
prevented the bill from coming to a
vote before Christmas. Last month the
Senate voted to send the measure back
to conference to remove a
controversial provision designed to
limit oil company profits.
Controversial Rollback
The conferees in turn substituted
the equally controversial price rollback
for the excess profits provision.
The rollback would set the price of
all domestically produced crude oil at
$5.25 per barrel and establish a ceiling
of $7.09 per barrel beyond which the
price of oil would not be allowed to
rise.
Roughly three-fourths of the oil
produced in this country is under price
controls and already is selling at $5.25
per barrel. The remaining one-quarter
has been exempted from price controls
in an effort to stimulate greater
production and currently is selling at
an average price of $9.51 per barrel.
In addition to the rollback, the bill
would suspend temporarily clean air
guidelines to permit power plants to

burn coal in place of scarce stocks of
low-sulfur oil and natural gas. The
legislation also would grant auto
makers a one-year delay in meeting car
exhaust standards.
