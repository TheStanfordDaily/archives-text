# Lyman Says University To Oppose T.A. Union
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
President Richard W. Lyman
yesterday outlined the reasons the
University will oppose the proposed
unionization of teaching and research
assistants when the issue comes before
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) next month.
Lyman's arguments, made on
KZSU's Campus Conference program,
fell into two broad categories: that
unionization of over 1600 graduate
students would set students and
faculty against each other and that the
litigation required by the collective
bargaining process would add to the

bureaucratization of the University.
According to Lyman, unionization
would inevitably "set faculty and the
faculty's own graduate students in an
adversary relationship."
Broadest Union
However, if the NLRB approves
formation of a student bargaining unit,
the University will ask that the unit be
made the broadest possible, he said. It
would be ridiculous for the University
to "carry on 90 sets of negotiations,"
one with the students in each
department.
A group of graduate students,
calling themselves the Stanford Union
of Research Assistants (SURA),
petitioned the NLRB last month for
the right to collectively bargain over
such issues as stipends and working
conditions. If the NLRB approves
formation of a bargaining unit, the
students would then vote on whether
to unionize.
Lyman denied that the University
wants a broad bargaining unit because
"the power-hungry administration
wants to grab the ball and run with
it," as he says is "implied if not
stated," in an article bv SURA officer

Mike O'Connor in Friday's Daily.
Charge Denied
In another labor-related matter,
Lyman flatly denied a charge by Jim
Berk, president of United Stanford
Employees, that the University is
"foot-dragging" in negotiations, trying
to force the union to test its strength
by calling a strike vote.
"We're not trying to play games,"
he said, adding that the administration
is negotiating on the issues, rather than
on a power basis.
In a far-ranging and often
philosophical discussion, Lyman also:
— said there has been no response
to last week's cable inviting exiled
Soviet writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn
to Stanford. He said the University did
not know if the Nobel-prizewinner
ever received the cable.
— refused to commit the University
to maintenance of a child care
program. The school will try to find
facilities for such a program if the
existing center must be moved, Lyman
said, but does not necessarily wish to
spend its own money in direct
support.
— noted there has been no action
toward requiring seniors to write a
thesis before graduation. Lyman, who
suggested last month that the
Academic Council study the
possibility of requiring an
extensively-critiqued senior project,
said,. "Presidential notions on what
faculty ought to teach usually are
treated as pipe dreams."
However, he again lamented that
"it's possible to come in as a bright,
promising student and go out as a
bright, promising student, without
ever getting any rigor," in the
educational process.
