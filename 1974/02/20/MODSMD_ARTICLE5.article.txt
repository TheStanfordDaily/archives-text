# Peru Study Program To Open In Autumn
## 
### DON COX 
Continuing the overhaul of the
Overseas Studies programs, the
Overseas office announced yesterday
the opening of a new program in Lima,
Peru beginning fall quarter.
The 15 to 25 students in the
program will be enrolled at the
Catholic University in Lima, a public
university, where they will take classes
with Peruvian students.
Anthropology Prof. Clifford
Barnett will direct the new program in
Lima and will conduct a weekly
seminar to orient students with the
area.
"The purpose of the program is to
provide an in-country experience for
the students," said Barnett. Students
will be free to follow up the first term
at the university in Lima with a second
term and/or to engage in independent
study of a specific interest.
Students will live with private
families in Lima. "Private apartments
for students are possible," said

Bernard Siegel, anthropology professor
and director of the Latin American
Studies Program, "but we feel it would
be better for them to live with
families."
"Lima is so intrinsically
interesting," said Siegel. "It is a major
developing area of the world with a
variety of problems represented
there."
Opportunities To Study
Barnett said the Catholic University
was a "good" university providing
opportunities to study in many areas
including political science,
anthropology and other social
sciences.
"The military government in power
in Peru for the last few years is
different from any other military
government. It is much more to the
left and concerned with peasant
welfare," said Siegel.
Barnett said that there were many
"people involved in [anthropological]
research who would be glad to have
students assisting them." This research
included archaeological digs.
Before, the cost of travelling to and
from a campus in Peru was prohibitive,
but the lower cost of living in Peru
now makes the program feasible,
Siegel said.
'Other Places'
"There are many other places in
South America we might have selected
"as sites for the program, said Overseas
office director Mark Mancall. But Peru
was picked because of faculty interest
and contacts in the area he indicated.
"We're talking about a significant
area of South America," said Barnett.
Peru is tied in with Bolivia, Ecuador
and the whole Andean region. It is a
very mixed area geographically and

culturally, said Barnett.
Mancall said it was a common
concept among Americans to think of
South America as one country. In
reality, "it is an incredible mix in one
country" alone, said Mancall.
Alumni Program
In an address to the Stanford
Mother's Club late yesterday
afternoon, Mancall spoke of the
difficulties and the benefits involved in
the sociological translation of a
student to a foreign culture via the
overseas studies program.
Mancall said that the Overseas
office was also working on plans to
make overseas programs of some kind
available to Stanford alumni.
"We haven't made too much
progress, but it's high on the agenda,"
said Mancall.

difficulties and the benefits involved in
the sociological translation of a
student to a foreign culture via the
overseas studies program.
Mancall said that the Overseas
office was also working on plans to
make overseas programs of some kind
available to Stanford alumni.
"We haven't made too much
progress, but it's high on the agenda,"
said Mancall.
Continuing the overhaul of the
Overseas Studies programs, the
Overseas office announced yesterday
the opening of a new program in Lima,
Peru beginning fall quarter.
The 15 to 25 students in the
program will be enrolled at the
Catholic University in Lima, a public
university, where they will take classes
with Peruvian students.
Anthropology Prof. Clifford
Barnett will direct the new program in
Lima and will conduct a weekly
seminar to orient students with the
area.
"The purpose of the program is to
provide an in-country experience for
the students," said Barnett. Students
will be free to follow up the first term
at the university in Lima with a second
term and/or to engage in independent
study of a specific interest.
Students will live with private
families in Lima. "Private apartments
for students are possible," said

Bernard Siegel, anthropology professor
and director of the Latin American
Studies Program, "but we feel it would
be better for them to live with
families."
"Lima is so intrinsically
interesting," said Siegel. "It is a major
developing area of the world with a
variety of problems represented
there."
Opportunities To Study
Barnett said the Catholic University
was a "good" university providing
opportunities to study in many areas
including political science,
anthropology and other social
sciences.
"The military government in power
in Peru for the last few years is
different from any other military
government. It is much more to the
left and concerned with peasant
welfare," said Siegel.
Barnett said that there were many
"people involved in [anthropological]
research who would be glad to have
students assisting them." This research
included archaeological digs.
Before, the cost of travelling to and
from a campus in Peru was prohibitive,
but the lower cost of living in Peru
now makes the program feasible,
Siegel said.
'Other Places'
"There are many other places in
South America we might have selected
"as sites for the program, said Overseas
office director Mark Mancall. But Peru
was picked because of faculty interest
and contacts in the area he indicated.
"We're talking about a significant
area of South America," said Barnett.
Peru is tied in with Bolivia, Ecuador
and the whole Andean region. It is a
very mixed area geographically and

culturally, said Barnett.
Mancall said it was a common
concept among Americans to think of
South America as one country. In
reality, "it is an incredible mix in one
country" alone, said Mancall.

In an address to the Stanford
Mother's Club late yesterday
afternoon, Mancall spoke of the
