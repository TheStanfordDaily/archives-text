# Couples Alter Lifestyles To Suit Careers
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Couples with both partners pursuing careers will no
doubt double their trouble, but they may double their
energy as well. University President Richard W. Lyman
speculated, "If it doesn't fracture it [the relationship], it
strengthens it."
Lyman and his wife Jing part :ipated with other career
couples in a panel discussion "Merging Lifestyle and
Career" sponsored by the Career Planning and Placement
Center yesterday evening.
For these happily married couples, budgeting time and
setting priorities are big problems. Jing called the situation
"a seesaw act." Greg Gallo, who works with his wife,
Penny, for the Palo Alto law firm, Ware and Friedenrich,
called it a "relative trade-off."
The Lymans, for example, were booked two months in
advance for yesterday's appearance. Jing pointed out, "It
takes not only us, [but] our two full-time secretaries ... to
keep on top of calendar problems." Her husband added,
"It's a peculiarity that you have to plan [out time] to be
relaxed."
'Family First'
Jing stated her priorities. "Family comes first and
University comes next." However Pres. Lyman demurred,
"The family might not agree that they come first. They
might in our hearts, but on the calendar they often don't."
Dr. Helen Krumboltz, prof, of education at San Jose
State, explained that raising her two daughters, presently
12 and 17, called for sacrifices. "I simply could not pull the
load. I didn't have the physical energy to carry a full-time
job and to do the kinds of things I was trained to do with
my children." She resorted to part-time teaching as an
"absolute necessity."
The Gallos conceded that children would complicate
their lifestyles. Greg Gallo calculated, "Children have to be
factored in."
For Mary Ann and Alan Austin, scheduling problems are

much too complex at this time to allow for introduction of
such variables. Mary Ann Austin, graduate of the School of
Business here, presently commutes to San Francisco where
she works as a tax consultant for Arthur Andersen and Co.
She sets her alarm for 5:15 a.m.
But her husband Alan, third year law student and officer
of the Stanford Law Review, still adheres to student hours.
"I'm the earliest one to arrive at the Law School in the
morning," he says with a laugh. He returns about midnight
— "by that time I've about fainted of exhaustion," says his
wife. The couple's vacations seldom coincide. One summer,
they saw each other only six weekends.
Work Together
Although the Gallos, unlike the Austins, work together,
Gallo estimates, "If we see each other ten minutes a day,
that's quite a lot."
"There's a certain element of competition that has to be
tempered and dealt with," he says.
From his own experience, he says, "We can categorically
recommend never to take the California Bar Exam at the
same time."
Penny Gallo explains, "Our work compliments rather
than being directly competitive." Her husband explains,
"Penny is a trusted colleague — we can understand each
other's work. I can sit down at dinner and thrash something
[a legal problem] through."
Mary Ann Austin points to the satisfaction her career
gives. "It feels good to know I could earn a living on my
own. I just like the feeling of being caught up in it." Her
husband adds, "If my wife were doing traditional kinds of
things, I simply would not respect her as much. I would not
look at her as an equal."
Lyman said that when he recommends faculty for the
presidency of a university, he usually urges consideration of
the candidate's wife, who plays a cmcial role within a
university despite her absence from the payroll.

takes not only us, [but] our two full-time secretaries ... to
keep on top of calendar problems." Her husband added,
"It's a peculiarity that you have to plan [out time] to be
relaxed."
'Family First'
Jing stated her priorities. "Family comes first and
University comes next." However Pres. Lyman demurred,
"The family might not agree that they come first. They
might in our hearts, but on the calendar they often don't."
Dr. Helen Krumboltz, prof, of education at San Jose
State, explained that raising her two daughters, presently
12 and 17, called for sacrifices. "I simply could not pull the
load. I didn't have the physical energy to carry a full-time
job and to do the kinds of things I was trained to do with
my children." She resorted to part-time teaching as an
"absolute necessity."
The Gallos conceded that children would complicate
their lifestyles. Greg Gallo calculated, "Children have to be
factored in."
For Mary Ann and Alan Austin, scheduling problems are

much too complex at this time to allow for introduction of
such variables. Mary Ann Austin, graduate of the School of
Business here, presently commutes to San Francisco where
she works as a tax consultant for Arthur Andersen and Co.
She sets her alarm for 5:15 a.m.
But her husband Alan, third year law student and officer
of the Stanford Law Review, still adheres to student hours.
"I'm the earliest one to arrive at the Law School in the
morning," he says with a laugh. He returns about midnight
— "by that time I've about fainted of exhaustion," says his
wife. The couple's vacations seldom coincide. One summer,
they saw each other only six weekends.
Work Together
Although the Gallos, unlike the Austins, work together,
Gallo estimates, "If we see each other ten minutes a day,
that's quite a lot."
"There's a certain element of competition that has to be
tempered and dealt with," he says.
From his own experience, he says, "We can categorically
recommend never to take the California Bar Exam at the
same time."
Penny Gallo explains, "Our work compliments rather
than being directly competitive." Her husband explains,
"Penny is a trusted colleague — we can understand each
other's work. I can sit down at dinner and thrash something
[a legal problem] through."
Mary Ann Austin points to the satisfaction her career
gives. "It feels good to know I could earn a living on my
own. I just like the feeling of being caught up in it." Her
husband adds, "If my wife were doing traditional kinds of
things, I simply would not respect her as much. I would not
look at her as an equal."
Lyman said that when he recommends faculty for the
presidency of a university, he usually urges consideration of
the candidate's wife, who plays a cmcial role within a
university despite her absence from the payroll.

CAREER COUPLES — University Pres. Richard Lyman, right, and his wife, Jing,
participated with other career couples in a panel discussion sponsored bv the
Career Planning and Placement Center yesterday evening. The panel agreed that
the big problems for married couples involved budgeting time and setting
priorities.
Couples with both partners pursuing careers will no
doubt double their trouble, but they may double their
energy as well. University President Richard W. Lyman
speculated, "If it doesn't fracture it [the relationship], it
strengthens it."
Lyman and his wife Jing part :ipated with other career
couples in a panel discussion "Merging Lifestyle and
Career" sponsored by the Career Planning and Placement
Center yesterday evening.
For these happily married couples, budgeting time and
setting priorities are big problems. Jing called the situation
"a seesaw act." Greg Gallo, who works with his wife,
Penny, for the Palo Alto law firm, Ware and Friedenrich,
called it a "relative trade-off."
The Lymans, for example, were booked two months in
advance for yesterday's appearance. Jing pointed out, "It
takes not only us, [but] our two full-time secretaries ... to
keep on top of calendar problems." Her husband added,
"It's a peculiarity that you have to plan [out time] to be
