On Syphilis Study
Editor:
There are some questions
raised by the article derived from
Dr. Charles Barnett's support of
the syphilis study as reported in
the Daily, Feb. 12. How can Dr.
Barnett excuse under the term
"poorly planned" the criticism
raised last year that the
participants had not given
consent?
I have been a member of the
Palo Alto Clinic since 1939, and
when I went to Stanford the Palo
Alto Clinic had a working
relationship with the Stanford
Health Services. Dr. Barnett seems
to be hedging on the "informed
consent" issue of the Tuskegee
Study.
What is his feeling on medical
experimentation on patients in
the Palo Alto-Stanford
community? Should "informed
consent" be obtained in all cases?
Has it always been done that way?
What is a good policy in his
opinion on this question? Why
does he care to support this
"poorly planned" study and
ignore this question of human
rights? What would he suggest be
a good policy for the future?

Wascher Passes Buck
Editor:
I found Jim Wascher's article
of Feb. 12, "Friend: Too Little,
Too Late' ' to be an exhibition of
buck-passing and hypocrisy.
If any one person is to be
blamed for the lack of student
input on the Row issue, it is not
Jim Friend, but Jim Wascher, who
was editor of the Daily from
September until late January. It
was Mr. Wascher's Daily that
failed to report the facts of the
Row issue before it was "too
late;" it was Mr. Wascher's Daily
that neglected to publish a single
investigative article on the Row
site issue, and has offered little
investigative reporting on any
issue of campus-wide concern.
How can a Daily editor fairly
blame the ASSU Council for lack
of student concern on an issue
when his own newspaper
neglected to provide the insight
needed to generate such concern?
Hypocrisy aside, Mr. Wascher's
article's worst disservice is its
implication that it is "too late" to
rescind the Row decision. On the
contrary, President Lyman has
ordered a review of the problem,
and admits that no final decision
has been made. Mr. Wascher
would perform a great service if
instead of engaging in political
bickering, he used his journalistic
talents to better inform us on the
Row site issue, a job he
shamefully ignored while being
editor of the Daily.

News Media Help Crime
Editor:
It would seem from
observations over the last few
years that a major promulgating
force in the world of crime and
terrorism has been the news
media. The first time someone
jumped out of the back of a 707
with a ransom and escaped, the
media published full details and

then we had a rash of such capers.
It would seem that the daily
newspaper has become a
do-it-yourself manual for the
currently vogue acts of crime.
Even more sinister are the
implications of recent events of
the Hearst kidnapping. First, the
methodology closely resembles
the modus operandi of the South
American terrorist groups, and
second, since the whole affair is
ostensibly "class action" by the
SLA for the slave masses (i.e.,
Robin Hood Socialism) it depends
heavily on publicity. One
common trait of terrorists is that
they brag about their past
escapades, claiming "credit" for
bombings, assassinations, etc., and
always this is widely publicized.
Other dangers are of public
backlash, the formation of
vigilante groups, the
re-enforcement of opposing
groups such as the Ku Klux Klan
or the American Nazis, and the
suspension of civil liberties to
restore order. Since the media can
influence "the madness of
crowds" greatly, perhaps more
sophistication and consideration
are needed in the selection and
dissemination of potentially
inflammatory news.
Currently exactly the opposite
tact is used as is especially visible
in the Watergate coverage, where
little attempt has been made, in
the news columns, to diguise the
cheap sensationalism and
misplaced advocacy. Perhaps the
media should be more careful not
to become unwitting advocates of
criminals and terrorists in their
mad persuit of "the news."

Housing Insanity
Editor:
The controversy over the
building of a new apartment
structure on the Row illustrates
the lack of sanity in the housing
situation at Stanford. For
example, last year before the
housing draw the University
published a booklet describing the
various residences. According to
the booklet, Roble had a certain
percentage of triples, singles, and
doubles. Like the proverbial
innocent I believed this and signed
the housing system's year-long
contract when I was offered a
space in Roble, only to find
myself stuffed into a quadruple.
Now if that is not an example
of false and misleading advertising
(which coerced a year's room and
board out of me that I would not
otherwise have spent), I don't
know what is. (For all you social
psychologists out there, if you
really want to see some incredible
psychoses induced by
overpopulation you should look
into the quadruples in Roble.)
And now the University has
the unmitigated audacity to
suggest more housing for faculty.
I mean, I'm sitting here in my
quad, with stereos to the left of
me and guitars to the right of me
trying to study and the University
wants me to vote in favor of more
faculty housing. This is like telling
a condemned man that the
money originally allocated to pay
for his last meal has been used
instead to replace a wire in the
electric chair.
