# Hearst Hysteria

I marvel at the hysteria the
abduction of Patricia Hearst has
caused in this country. Our
government is now in the process
of spending an estimated $50
billion on the Trident program, a
supermissile program whose only
purpose is to kill and which
effectively adds little to the
capacity we already have for
eliminating all life on earth. This is
acquired at a cost of billions, with
nary a ripple of protest from the
public. The Trident is our gesture
toward the Pentagon and the
military-industrial complex.
Miss Hearst's father, through
the power of the press he
controls, has contributed no little
to our making it. The SLA now
demands that he use his wealth
and power to produce a few
millions to feed the poor — a
gesture, to be sure — and people,
from right to left, are falling all
over themselves denouncing it.
Kidnaping Cruel Crime
Kidnaping is a very cruel crime.
But it is no crueler than the
crimes our country perpetrated
for nine years in Southeast Asia
and, through its support of the
Thieu and Lon Nol regimes, still
perpetrates. Thieu still holds, by
conservative estimate, about
200,000 people in his prisons, and
we, the taxpayers, have through
our elected government just
pledged him an additional billion
dollars to, in effect, go on holding
them.
Mr. Hearst, the anguished

father to whom our hearts go out
with each evening's news, has
consistently in his papers and with
the enormous propaganda
capacity he has cheered on our
government's support of the
regimes — which could not exist
without that support — in
Southeast Asia, the Philippines,
Greece, Brazil, Chile,
Mozambique, Iran, and so forth.
And these in turn abduct
people by the thousands, hold
them prisoner, torture and
execute them. Their prisoners also
have mothers and fathers and
children anguishing over their
fates, but the American public is,
by and large, comfortably
unruffled by them.
Victims Not Rulers
Miss Hearst is white and a
member of the ruling class. The
millions of victims our
government has made and helped
make throughout the globe are
generally neither, and to our
eternal shame we do not barrage
the newspapers and radio stations
to learn of their fate, send money
to their familiies or pray for their
well-being.
I hope Patricia Hearst comes
out of this alive and well. But her
ordeal should remind us that
through our silence and our
lethargy we are ourselves daily in
dreadful complicity with the
filthy deeds our government
occasions.
