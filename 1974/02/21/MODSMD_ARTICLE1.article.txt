# Rhodes Says He'll Seek House Seat

### BRUCE KADDEN 
Herbert Rhodes, a University
employment representative and a
member of the East Palo Alto
Municipal Council, announced his
candidacy for the Democratic primary
in the reapportioned 12th
congressional district yesterday.
Rhodes became the second
candidate on the Democratic side in
the new district which includes
Stanford and Palo Alto. Last week,
Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor
entered the race.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo
Park, and Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp are the announced
Republican candidates. McCloskey
now represents the 17th district, which
stretches from Hillsborough to East
San Jose. The new 12th district runs
from Redwood City to Santa Clara. It
includes Los Altos and Los Altos Hills,
but does not include any of San Jose.
Rhodes, 44, had previously filed for
the 21st state Assembly race, but
changed his mind. "I have decided to
run for the Democratic Party
nomination [for Congress] because I
believe that a campaign should be an
informational and educational forum,"
his statement said.
Rhodes has until March 8 to
officially file for the congressional
race. He said that he probably will lose
his filing fee for the Assembly race.
Grass Root Individual
One reason Rhodes changed to the
congressional race is because of his
reluctance to run against Santa Clara
County Supervisor Victor Calvo in the
21st district. "He has a very good
record across the board," Rhodes
stated. "I wouldn't serve any useful
purpose running against him."
Asked about the differences
between Gillmor and himself, Rhodes
said he was "more the grass root kind
of individual . .. just a little average
citizen."
