# Rhodes Says He'll Seek House Seat

### BRUCE KADDEN 
Herbert Rhodes, a University
employment representative and a
member of the East Palo Alto
Municipal Council, announced his
candidacy for the Democratic primary
in the reapportioned 12th
congressional district yesterday.
Rhodes became the second
candidate on the Democratic side in
the new district which includes
Stanford and Palo Alto. Last week,
Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor
entered the race.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo
Park, and Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp are the announced
Republican candidates. McCloskey
now represents the 17th district, which
stretches from Hillsborough to East
San Jose. The new 12th district runs
from Redwood City to Santa Clara. It
includes Los Altos and Los Altos Hills,
but does not include any of San Jose.
Rhodes, 44, had previously filed for
the 21st state Assembly race, but
changed his mind. "I have decided to
run for the Democratic Party
nomination [for Congress] because I
believe that a campaign should be an
informational and educational forum,"
his statement said.
Rhodes has until March 8 to
officially file for the congressional
race. He said that he probably will lose
his filing fee for the Assembly race.
Grass Root Individual
One reason Rhodes changed to the
congressional race is because of his
reluctance to run against Santa Clara
County Supervisor Victor Calvo in the
21st district. "He has a very good
record across the board," Rhodes
stated. "I wouldn't serve any useful
purpose running against him."
Asked about the differences
between Gillmor and himself, Rhodes
said he was "more the grass root kind
of individual . .. just a little average
citizen."

NEW DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE — University Employment Representative
Herbert Rhodes, who recently announced his candidacy for the state Assembly,
has now decided to seek the Democratic nomination in the 12th district
congressional race. Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo Park, is one of the
announced candidates for the Republican nomination in the newly-created
district, which includes the University.
Rhodes said Congress "should
procede with all due haste" in
considering Presidential impeachment.
He would not say whether he
personally favored it.
Energy Crisis An Issue
Rhodes criticized both political
parties for failing to deal with the
energy crisis. "The Democrats were
afraid to ask the unions to press for an
alternative to the gasoline gobblers,"
and"the Republicans were afraid to
speak out against the oil companies,"
his statement claimed.
"Now we all sit grumbling in the gas
lines because we didn't have the
courage to meet the issue until it
became a crisis," he continued.
Rhodes also said that
unemployment and the ruin of small
businessmen by the energy crisis and
crime would be among his campaign
issues. "I want to talk about crime in
the streets, which is a popular issue,
and I want to talk about white collar
crime, which is not," he said.
Rhodes ran unsuccessfully for the

San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors in November. In his only
other previous race for elective office,
Rhodes finished second running for a
single seat on the San Mateo County
Board of Education.
Gillmor was nosed out in the 1972
Democratic primary for McCloskey's
seat by Palo Alto attorney James
Stewart. Stewart in turn lost to
McCloskey in the general election.
Strong Democratic Challenger
Contacted yesterday, Stewart said
he will not base his decision to run
again on the candidates in the
Democratic primary, but on whether
he thinks Knapp can beat McCloskey.
He said that if he finds that a "strong
Democratic challenger is needed" to
beat Knapp, he will run.
Stewart, analyzing the prospective
Democratic race, said there could be
"three candidates from the northern
part of the district, and only Gillmor
in the south." Besides Rhodes and
himself, Stewart mentioned Palo Alto
attorney Tom Skornia.
