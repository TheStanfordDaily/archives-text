# The 						Case Against Medical Licensure

Dr. A.P. Gelpi's statement that
the AMA "does not regulate
admissions to medical schools" is
correct. However, through their
control over the accreditation of
those schools they exert powerful
control over the number of
medical schools and, therefore,
the number of medical students.
The distinction hardly seems
worth making.
Mark Anderson's assertion that
"increasing the number of doctors
available would only aggravate the
maldistribution" defies economic
sense. As the number of doctors
increased, those moving into the
more desirable areas would find
themselves in such great
competition that they would be
forced to look for employment in
other, less desirable areas, e.g.
lower class and rural locations.
The plan I proposed in an
earlier article is a recommendation
by Prof. Reuben Kessel of the
University of Chicago that state
medical examining board testing
be open to all applicants, not just
those who attended AMA
accredited schools, to create
greater competition in the
production of medical students
and to reduce the cost in
producing doctors. Tim Haight
attacks this plan on basically two

grounds: that it would not result
in a lower cost in producing
doctors and that it would allow a
large number of unqualified
doctors to enter the medical
profession.
In arguing against these two
criticisms, I will take the position
of a plan proposed by economist
Milton Friedman, that all
licensure of medicine should be
abandoned. "Who is to determine
who should be allowed to practice
medicine on my body?" Friedman
asks. If I want acupuncture, why
should anyone be able to tell me I
can't have it?
Restricted Number
Graduation from an accredited
school being a requirement before
one can take the examining tests
for licensure, licensure restricts
the number of medical schools
through the AMA's control of
accreditation. IStew schools would
be formed that -would turn out a
variety of medical training from
the very inexpensive and basic to
the highly expensive and first rate.
All schools would not be
attempting to produce specialist
experts, but the middle quality
ones, say, general practitioners,
and the lower level ones,
paramedic types. The increased
competition among the greater

numbers of schools would drive
the costs down.
Similarly, the costs of medical
care would drop due to the
increased competition. Highly
trained physicians would no
longer have to do simple medical
tasks that workers with less health
training could do. There would be
greater use of efficient group
practice combining people of
various skills and skill levels due
to the market demands for lower
costs.
Danger Of Quacks?
Yet even granting that such a
system would lower costs, is there
not a greater danger of quacks?
Licensure, it is claimed, assures a
minimum level of consumer
protection. Yet is the fact that a
man passed a medical examination
thirty years ago any guarantee of
his present ability?
The way people select doctors
under the Friedman system would
be pretty much the same way
they do today, by personal
reputation or by the reputation of
the institution the doctor is
affiliated with. Because of the
increased competition, health
institutions would be under a
greater need to maintain a good

reputation and would carefully
screen health personnel.
The consumer could still bring
malpractice suits. However, the
greatest protection could be
through certification of doctors,
preferably privately, although
government certification is a
possibility. Consumers would still
be free to go to all doctors but
would have the assurance of
knowing which ones were
approved. And the competition of
the uncertified ones would keep
prices down.
Sound Proposal
I am not fully convinced of the
case against licensure. Nonetheless
I do hope that this brief exposure
to the arguments in its favor will
convince some that it is a far more
sound proposal than it may at
first seem and merits further
consideration and discussion.
The Kessel proposal I advanced
would still keep licensure, but
loosen the control over the
number of doctors and lead to
lower costs in producing both
doctors and medical services. It is
not an end-all or cure-all. But it is
a sound first step toward solving
the doctor shortage.
