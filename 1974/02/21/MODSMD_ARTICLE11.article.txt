# Bolivian Peasants Coerced

When news from Bolivia makes
its rare appearance in our national
media, it generally concerns a
national disaster or another
change of government. The latter
is frequent. Recent reports of the
use of the Bolivian army to break
peasant blockades near the city of
Cochabamba are a presage of
both.
In 1973 the Bolivian peso was
devalued. The net effect on the
internal economy has been to
significantly reduce buying power,
especially for the rural peasant
agriculturalist and the lower
classes of the towns and cities. A
major relief was provided by a
policy of maintaining fixed prices
for major food items such as
bread and meat. However, last
month President Banzer Suarez
raised these fixed prices by 100
percent.
The action was taken to
prevent smuggling of foodstuffs
into neighboring countries, made
profitable by the lower prices in
Bolivia. This created local food
shortages and further upset the
fragile internal economy.
(Bolivians asked why Banzer did
not pressure his brother-in-law, in
charge of the customs service, to
crack down on the smuggling
instead of raising prices. But the
black market is extensive — and
open — in Bolivia, as is bribery of
customs officials.)
For the peasant agriculturalist,
the timing of the move was
particularly bad. Potatoes, the
major market crop for many, are
harvested and sold in November.
The bulk of peasant purchases is
food to supplement the
traditional meager diet.
Peasant Ties
Under past national regimes
(notably the MNR, 1952-G4, and
General Rene Barrientos,
1964-69) the Cochabamba
peasants had political ties with the
national government. These could

be used to seek redress of
grievances. The present
government is increasingly
rightist, and has sought to keep
peasants "out of politics."
It was thus not surprising when
the peasants sought, early this
month, to compel attention to
their difficulties by blockading all
the highways into the city of
Cochabamba. What was surprising,
and tragic, is that the
Cochabamba army garrison was
used to break the blockades. This
was done even though the military
governor of the department had
reached an accord with the
blockading groups.
The significance of the use of
the army must be understood in
reference to recent national
history. After the Revolution of
1952, the army was disbanded
and the peasants armed and
organized into militias. The army
was gradually reorganized (with
U.S. military assistance and
training) and under General
Barrientos the peasants were
disarmed. However, a pact was
signed, guaranteeing military
protection and aid to the
peasantry.
Coercive Force
Not only would that pact now
appear to be broken, but it is the
first time since 1952 that direct
coercive force has been used on
the Cochabamba farmers. The
army has returned to its role as
the traditional agent of repression
of the peasantry.
It seems clear that, faced with
heavy pressures from the sources
of the external capital needed to
finance development — mainly the
U.S. and, increasingly, Brazil — to
maintain "internal political
stability," the government is
turning to increasingly repressive
measures. Indications are that a
coup is being readied from the
ultra-right in the military. The
left, extensively factionalized

during the Torres regime, is
gradually reorganizing, but seems
unlikely to quickly return to
power.
You may soon be reading
about it in the newspapers, but
what you probably won't read is
anything about the effect of this
incident on the few gains made by
the peasantry (over 80 percent of
the population) in 1952.
Although their political innocence
has frequently made them the
tools of national politicians, since
the revolution the peasant
syndicates have at least retained
political control over the
countryside and made some

economic advance.
The present action by the
government will embolden the
towns and cities in reneving their
claims to traditional control. This
process was beginning soon after
the attitude of the present
government toward the peasants
became evident.
Bolivia's revolution fell far
short of many of its goals. It
seems a pity to see the gains to its
long-exploited Indian peasants so
summarily nullified.
