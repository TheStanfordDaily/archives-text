# New Party's Slate
## 
### 
Bill Evers
Meeting in Berkeley last
weekend, the new, small, and
radically individualist Libertarian
Party of California picked its
1974 state election candidates,
one of whom is a Stanford
University staff member.
William White of the Computer
Science Department is the
Libertarians' choice for senator.
Other candidates for high office
are John Hospers, philosophy
professor at the University of
Southern California, for governor;
William Susel, a Los Angeles
chemical engineer, for lieutenant
governor; and David Bergland, a
Newport Beach lawyer, for
attorney general.
Completing the slate are Lloyd
Taylor, a San Francisco certified
public accountant, for treasurer;
Veronica Meidus, a Santa Cruz
professional photographer, for
secretary of state; and Kathleen
White, a Los Altos airline purser,
for comptroller.
The party also endorsed Hal
Jindrich, a Mountain View
consulting psychologist, for the
non-partisan post of
superintendent of public
instruction. All Libertarian
nominees are write-in candidates.
Hospers, who heads the
Philosophy Department at USC,
was previously the national
Libertarian Party's 1972
candidate for president of the
United States. He received one
vote in the elctoral college from a
dissident Republican elector.
Major Issues
In an interview with this
columnist, William White named
five issues that he intends to focus
on in his senatorial campaign. The
first is the inflation caused by the
government's expansionary
monetary policy. White plans to
call for the legalization of gold
ownership, in part to serve as a
check upon inflation.
Secondly, White believes that
the general public is upset by the
heavy burden of taxation it is
forced to bear. He advocates a
drastic rollback of taxes.
Third, White sees the civil
liberties of Americans directly
threatened by mental
hospitalization laws. Some of the
worst of which, he says, are
federal statutes.
Fourth, White considers the
right to bear arms to be a part of
the right of self-defense and
considers gun control laws to be
the removal of the final defense
against governmental tyranny. He
therefore would work in the U.S.
Senate for the immediate repeal
of the Federal Gun Control Act of
1968.
Finally, White would work in
Congress to end all foreign aid
(from military aid to South
Vietnam to escapades like the
Russian wheat deal).
'Party of Principle'
The Libertarian Party calls
itself "the party of principle," and
its members say it deserves this
title because of the consistency of
its stands on the issues.
The party's statement of
principles proclaims that "each
individual has the right to exercise
dominion over his own life, and
has the right to live his own life in
whatever manner he chooses, so
long as he does not forcibly
interfere with the equal right of
others to live their lives in
whatever manner they choose."
Students of political theory
will recognize this as a rewording
of the "law of equal freedom"
that was the basic axiom of the
early political thought of
nineteenth-century British
philosopher Herbert Spencer.
Members of the Libertarian
Party explain that all the party's
stands on political questions can
be derived from this fundamental
premise.
CMI Endorsement
At the state convention, the
party endorsed the California
Marijuana Initiative as a first step
on the road to legalizing the use
and sale of all drugs. This was part
of the party's general
programmatic goal of repealing all
"victimless crime" laws.
As part of an over-all effort to
remove government from the
sphere of education, the party
came out against compulsory'
busing of school children and in
favor of charging full tuition at
public universities.
The state convention also
passed a resolution condemming
the aggressive terrorism used by
the Symbionese Liberation Army
against innocent people. It
allocated funds to publicize an
election-law suit to which the
Libertarians are a party (with the
Socialist Workers Party and other
groups). The suit seeks to
liberalize the requirements for
third parties to get on the ballot
in California.

'Party of Principle'
The Libertarian Party calls
itself "the party of principle," and
its members say it deserves this
title because of the consistency of
its stands on the issues.
The party's statement of
principles proclaims that "each
individual has the right to exercise
dominion over his own life, and
has the right to live his own life in
whatever manner he chooses, so
long as he does not forcibly
interfere with the equal right of
others to live their lives in
whatever manner they choose."
Students of political theory
will recognize this as a rewording
of the "law of equal freedom"
that was the basic axiom of the
early political thought of
nineteenth-century British
philosopher Herbert Spencer.
Members of the Libertarian
Party explain that all the party's
stands on political questions can
be derived from this fundamental
premise.
CMI Endorsement
At the state convention, the
party endorsed the California
Marijuana Initiative as a first step
on the road to legalizing the use
and sale of all drugs. This was part
of the party's general
programmatic goal of repealing all
"victimless crime" laws.
As part of an over-all effort to
remove government from the
sphere of education, the party
came out against compulsory'
busing of school children and in
favor of charging full tuition at
public universities.
The state convention also
passed a resolution condemming
the aggressive terrorism used by
the Symbionese Liberation Army
against innocent people. It
allocated funds to publicize an
election-law suit to which the
Libertarians are a party (with the
Socialist Workers Party and other
groups). The suit seeks to
liberalize the requirements for
third parties to get on the ballot
in California.

Meeting in Berkeley last
weekend, the new, small, and
radically individualist Libertarian
Party of California picked its
1974 state election candidates,
one of whom is a Stanford
University staff member.
William White of the Computer
Science Department is the
Libertarians' choice for senator.
Other candidates for high office
are John Hospers, philosophy
professor at the University of
Southern California, for governor;
William Susel, a Los Angeles
chemical engineer, for lieutenant
governor; and David Bergland, a
Newport Beach lawyer, for
attorney general.
Completing the slate are Lloyd
Taylor, a San Francisco certified
public accountant, for treasurer;
Veronica Meidus, a Santa Cruz
professional photographer, for
secretary of state; and Kathleen
White, a Los Altos airline purser,
for comptroller.
The party also endorsed Hal
Jindrich, a Mountain View
consulting psychologist, for the
non-partisan post of
superintendent of public
instruction. All Libertarian
nominees are write-in candidates.
Hospers, who heads the
Philosophy Department at USC,
was previously the national
Libertarian Party's 1972
candidate for president of the
United States. He received one
vote in the elctoral college from a
dissident Republican elector.
Major Issues
In an interview with this
columnist, William White named
five issues that he intends to focus
on in his senatorial campaign. The
first is the inflation caused by the
government's expansionary
monetary policy. White plans to
call for the legalization of gold
ownership, in part to serve as a
check upon inflation.
Secondly, White believes that
the general public is upset by the
heavy burden of taxation it is
forced to bear. He advocates a
drastic rollback of taxes.
Third, White sees the civil
liberties of Americans directly
threatened by mental
hospitalization laws. Some of the
worst of which, he says, are
federal statutes.
Fourth, White considers the
right to bear arms to be a part of
the right of self-defense and
considers gun control laws to be
the removal of the final defense
against governmental tyranny. He
therefore would work in the U.S.
Senate for the immediate repeal
of the Federal Gun Control Act of
1968.
Finally, White would work in
Congress to end all foreign aid
(from military aid to South
Vietnam to escapades like the
Russian wheat deal).
