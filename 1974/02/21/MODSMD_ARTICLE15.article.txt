# Panel Ponders Students' Role In Policy Formation
## 
### 
A panel discussion about
University governance will be
held this evening at 7:15 in
Annenberg Auditorium. Panel
members will be Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, ASSU Vice
President James Friend and
former ASSU Vice President
Brent Appel.
The question discussed will
be: What role should students
play in administrative decisions
that affect them at Stanford?
Some areas to be addressed
include housing, academic

programs (such as SWOPSI and
SCIRE), social programs (such as
the proposed campus pub), and
finance and budget issues.
The panel is part of the
"Everything You Always
Wanted to Know About
Stanford" lecture series
sponsored by the Student
Development Committee.
