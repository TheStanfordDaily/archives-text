# At Berkeley Concert
## Zappa Wires Crowd 
### ANDREW WILLARD 
BERKELEY - "Let's get on
with it." â€” Frank Zappa
The concert had already
started as we zipped through a
recent earth aberration, San
Francisco, on our way to
. Berkeley, where another upheaval
took place.
The Berkeley Community
Theater is an ideal scaffold from
which to hang Frank Zappa and
the Mother's of Invention. The
architecture, particularly the
walls, creates a continuous and
static ripple, much like Zappa's
high-powered current, a
spasmodic electricity that grips
the audience from the moment he
first gyrates onto the stage.
"It's a cozy table," he said, as
we slithered into our seats.
"We're gonna have fun," she
oozed.
"And champagne . .. my
dear."
"Mmmmm, delicious, ha ha."
"You like it? MMmmmm,
hmm, ha ha."
"MMMMmmm, delicious."
"Hee hee, hee... ."
"I like it too, Ha ha."
"MMMmmm mah ha ha "
There were no cooties in the
Berkeley Community Theater as
we picked our teeth with two
heavy-duty zircon encrusted
tweezers, waiting for the dew to
hit the stage.
Raucous Crowd
In the mean-time, Casey Kelly
came on with, "I Wish I Knew," a
two-year old song that resonated.
Kelly subdued the raucous crowd
and by the time Zappa descended,
the theater was packed, a
solid-state waiting to explode into
Zappa's overactive neural space.
The feeling was mutual.
Zappa's transmission began
with a five-song medley that filled
the theatrical synapse with a loud
kaleidescope. An instrumental
substrate developed early as vocals

assumed an unusual (for Zappa)
subordinate position. The nine
musicians that comprise Zappa's
outfit alternately displayed their
musical precision and accuracy
throughout the entire charade.
The rhythm and percussion
sections, consisting of two
synchronic drummers, a
vibraharpist and an outstanding
performance from George Duke
on the synthesizer and keyboard,
energized the audience and the
band with a pulsating staccato
that lasted throughout the

The Stanford Daily

Entertainment

two-hour performance.
The melody was obscure in
two of the songs, "Inca Roads"
and "Approximate." This was no
surprise since Zappa announced
that the rhythm section was finely
tuned whereas the rest of the
band (two guitars, trombone,
saxophone and flute) had their
choice as to melody and pitch.
Barroom Derelicts
Despite the individual options,
the unit managed two outstanding
and integrated selections. "Cosmic
Debris"featured tenor saxophone,
electric piano and Zappa on the
electric guitar. "Dupre's Paradise
Lounge" (this reviewer's favorite),
located in Watts, California, is a
lengthy expose of the Mother's
recent exploration into jazz and
barroom derelicts. Actually both
tendencies have surfaced
separately, but for the first time

flowed together in this excellent
piece that had the audience
twisting, turning, then roaring and
finally burning.
Other selections included
"Montana" (the only song from a
recent album), the story of an idle
speculator who is planning on
movin' to Montana to start
growing dental floss; and another
medley consisting of "Pygmy
Twilight," "The Idiot Bastard's
Son" and "A Little More
Cheapness Please." This medley
included some vague allusion to

Richard Nixon. Generally, as
Zappa said, the political
implications of the concert
reached all the way to Butte,
Montana.
Pink Haze
After vibrating with the
Mother's cacaphony for two
hours, the audience filtered out
through the smoke-filled pink
haze, a soft velvet that was
completely still.
This Over-Nite Sensation, the
title of the Mother's latest album,
concluded with the following
lyrics:
I have taken your time, I have
sung you my song
Ain't no great revelation, but it
wasn't too long.
An that's awright people, I'm just
crazy enough to sing to you,
any old way
I figure the odds be fifty-fifty
I just might have something to
say.
Finally, it should be
remembered in Frank Zappa's
own words, "The guru may be
short, but he's bogus."
