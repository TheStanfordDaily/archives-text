Court Broadens Wiretap Power
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
approved the use of evidence gathered by court-ordered
wiretaps against persons not specifically under surveillance.
The six to three decision said the Federal Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1970 requires that warrants
name specific persons only when the government has
probable cause to believe they are acting illegally.
Otherwise, a wiretap may lawfully be placed on a
telephone over which it is suspected that unnamed persons
are committing an offense, the court said.
The decision arose from an attempt to suppress wiretap
evidence gathered by the FBI against a suspected
bookmaker's wife. The warrant authorizing the tap named
only the suspect and "persons as yet unknown," but not his
wife.
Reinecke Will Testify If Asked
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke will be a
prosecution witness against former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell if Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski asks him to
do so, Reinecke said yesterday.
Reinecke also said he is still in the race for the
Republican nomination for governor and won't drop out
even if he is indicted in the ITT case.
He added that he hopes to take a lie detector test next
Monday or Tuesday to clear his name in Jaworski's
investigation of an antitrust suit against International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
The lieutenant governor said Tuesday he expects to
undergo an FBI lie detector test to clear him of wrongdoing
when he visits Washington Monday.
The investigation involves whether there was any
connection between the U.S. Justice Department's
settlement of an antitrust suit against ITT and ITT's
$400,000 offer — relayed by Reinecke to Mitchell — to
help finance the 1972 Republican National Convention.
Public Watergate Hearings To End
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate committee has
voted to end public hearings unless it uncovers
extraordinary new evidence.
Chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., said the move reflects
the panel's awareness that the focus of Watergate has
shifted to the courts and to the impeachment inquiry in the
House of Representatives.
The 6-1 vote cancels two sets of hearings for which
witnesses already had been announced.
They are an inquiry into the circumstances of a
$100,000 payment made by billionaire Howard Hughes to
C.G. "Bebe" Rebozo, a close friend of the President, and
alleged links between campaign payments made by the milk
industry and a Nixon administration decision increasing
dairy price supports.
Ervin told newsmen those and other unfinished
investigations will be included in the panel's final report.
The dissenting vote to end public hearings was cast by
Sen. Edward J. Gurney, R-Fla.
Meir Forms Minority Government
JERUSALEM — Premier Golda Meir announced last
night she was forming a minority government, the first in
Israel's history.
Observers said that despite the weakness of a minority
government, it would probably be able to handle the
Israeli-Arab negotiations with a strong hand because of
backing in Parliament on questions of war and peace.
Moshe Dayan, who has threatened to resign over

criticism of his handling of the October war, was invited to
remain as defense minister.
The announcement resolved a seven-week Cabinet crisis,
but promised major clashes in Israel's Knesset, or
parliament.
Kissinger Meets Latin Diplomats
MEXICO CITY — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
arrived yesterday for a Latin American foreign ministers'
conference where he is expected to face attempts to obtain
a more lenient U.S. policy toward Communist Cuba.
State Department officials in Washington have said
Kissinger has no intention of altering the 12-year economic
blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States. But the
secretary said on arrival: "We have come to listen with
understanding and friendship, and we intend to respond
with honesty and cooperation."
Argentina and Peru indicated shortly before Kissinger's
arrival to meet with 24 Latin American and Caribbean
foreign ministers that he would be confronted with new
moves to get Washington to ease its hostility against the
Fidel Castro regime.
Hearst Food Plan To Begin?
HILLSBOROUGH — Newspaper magnate Randolph A.
Hearst says he hopes the $2 million food distribution
program prompted by demands from his daughter's
kidnapers can get rolling tomorrow and bring about her
freedom.
Secretary of State A. Ludlow Kramer of Washington,
named to administer the Hearst program, said today
Hearst's "People In Need" program has already received
$100,000 worth of free food, 32 donated trucks and offers
of 70,000 square feet of warehouse space.
He said he expects the food distribution to begin
tomorrow at two unannounced locations in San Francisco
and one in Oakland. He said the program would then go
statewide.
Inflation Soared In 1973
WASHINGTON — The final report on 1973 inflation was
in yesterday and showed what most Americans already
knew, that prices throughout the economy were climbing
steeply and steadily as the year drew to a close.
The inflation rate in the final three months of the year
was 8.8 percent, and for the year prices rose 5.4 percent,
the Commerce Department said in its revised report on the
1973 Gross National Product.
The report showed that real economic growth in the final
quarter was 1.6 percent and for the year it was 5.9 percent.
Total value of the nation's output of goods and services was
at a rate of $1,337.5 billion at year's end.
Dark Named A's Manager
OAKLAND — Alvin Dark, one of 10 managers fired b>
Charles O. Finley in the past, was the last-minute choice
yesterday to manage the Oakland A's this season.
"Yes, he has been manager of this club before. Yes, he
was fired. Yes, he is back to manage this club. Yes, he
expects to be fired again some day," A's owner Finley said
with a smile as he announced the return of Dark.
