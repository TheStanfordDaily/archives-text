# Britain Campus Plans Health Care Program
## 
### DON COX 
Beginning in 1975, the summer
quarter of the Stanford-in-Britain
overseas program at Cliveden will be
devoted entirely to a program designed
and timed for pre-medical and medical
students, the Overseas Studies Office
announced yesterday.
Dr. Count D. Gibson, associate dean
of the Medical School, explained that
10 medical school students and 30
undergraduates will participate in the
"Health Care and Public Policy"
program at Cliveden.
The students will engage in a
comprehensive examination of British
health care policy, including technical,
political, social and economic aspects.
"Britain is solving her health care
problems in a manner different from
others. This presents the opportunity
to develop a program in which to
compare the way problems are being
solved" in Britain and in other
countries, said Gibson, director of the
new program.
Dr. Paul Basch, associate professor
of community and preventive
medicine, said that the Cliveden
program could also be "the focal point
for access to other health systems on
the continent."
Three-Part Program
The new program will be divided
into three parts:
— a four-week introductory session
at Cliveden during which courses will
be offered on health care economics,
planning and delivery to prepare
students for the following field work;
— three weeks of investigative field
work, during which students, working
in teams of four, will "fan out"
through Britain researching different
economic, political and social aspects
and problems of the health care
system;
— and a terminal period of three weeks
at Cliveden with teams reporting on
their findings to the entire group and
discussing them in seminars.
"We think that the combination of
rich assets the United Kingdom has to
offer in this regard" and the interested
students make this a good summer
program, said Gibson.
Alternative For Premeds
Gibson said that premeds should
consider applying for the program
rather than taking more medicine
oriented courses in an attempt to be
favored by a medical school for
admission.
"When you have a large number of

people applying to medical school,"
Gibson said, it is not to the premed
student's advantage to take any more
medical courses once he has corripleted
the basic requirements. The overseas
program would be a good alternative,
he suggested.
"There is also a crucial need for
physicians trained not only in the hard
sciences, but also in the social sciences
in order that they understand the
complex situation into which they
have to fit themselves," said Gibson.
General studies courses on British
culture and history will also be offered
in the new program.
Though it is specifically timed and
intended for pre-medical and medical
students, Gibson emphasized that
non-medical students interested in
public policy and social welfare should
consider applying for the program.

— and a terminal period of three weeks
at Cliveden with teams reporting on
their findings to the entire group and
discussing them in seminars.
"We think that the combination of
rich assets the United Kingdom has to
offer in this regard" and the interested
students make this a good summer
program, said Gibson.
Alternative For Premeds
Gibson said that premeds should
consider applying for the program
rather than taking more medicine
oriented courses in an attempt to be
favored by a medical school for
admission.
"When you have a large number of

people applying to medical school,"
Gibson said, it is not to the premed
student's advantage to take any more
medical courses once he has corripleted
the basic requirements. The overseas
program would be a good alternative,
he suggested.
"There is also a crucial need for
physicians trained not only in the hard
sciences, but also in the social sciences
in order that they understand the
complex situation into which they
have to fit themselves," said Gibson.
General studies courses on British
culture and history will also be offered
in the new program.
Though it is specifically timed and
intended for pre-medical and medical
students, Gibson emphasized that
non-medical students interested in
public policy and social welfare should
consider applying for the program.
Beginning in 1975, the summer
quarter of the Stanford-in-Britain
overseas program at Cliveden will be
devoted entirely to a program designed
and timed for pre-medical and medical
students, the Overseas Studies Office
announced yesterday.
Dr. Count D. Gibson, associate dean
of the Medical School, explained that
10 medical school students and 30
undergraduates will participate in the
"Health Care and Public Policy"
program at Cliveden.
The students will engage in a
comprehensive examination of British
health care policy, including technical,
political, social and economic aspects.
"Britain is solving her health care
problems in a manner different from
others. This presents the opportunity
to develop a program in which to
compare the way problems are being
solved" in Britain and in other
countries, said Gibson, director of the
new program.
Dr. Paul Basch, associate professor
of community and preventive
medicine, said that the Cliveden
program could also be "the focal point
for access to other health systems on
the continent."
Three-Part Program
The new program will be divided
into three parts:
— a four-week introductory session
at Cliveden during which courses will
be offered on health care economics,
planning and delivery to prepare
students for the following field work;
— three weeks of investigative field
work, during which students, working
in teams of four, will "fan out"
through Britain researching different
economic, political and social aspects
and problems of the health care
system;
— and a terminal period of three weeks
at Cliveden with teams reporting on
their findings to the entire group and
discussing them in seminars.
"We think that the combination of
rich assets the United Kingdom has to
