# Candidate Flournoy To Speak At TMU
## 
### 
State Controller Houston I.
Flournoy, a leading contender for the
Republican nomination for governor,
will speak today at 2 p.m. in Room
270 at Tresidder Memorial Union.
Following a short talk on the
politics involved in California
universities, Flournoy will answer
questions from the audience.
His appearance is sponsored by the
Stanford chapter of the California
Republican League.
Flournoy served three terms in the

state Assembly before being elected to
his present post of controller in 1966.
Generally considered a moderate,
Flournoy was recently endorsed by
industrialist David Packard and
Congressman Pete McCloskey. His
only opponent in the June primary is
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke.
Others who were considered
potential candidates, such as state
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger and former
Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare Robert Finch, have decided
against running.
Flournoy holds a doctorate in
political science and was formerly a
professor of government at Pomona
College and Claremont Graduate
School.
