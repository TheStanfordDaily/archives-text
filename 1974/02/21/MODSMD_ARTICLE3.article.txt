# Committee OKs Terrace Traffic Plan
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committee last night endorsed a plan
designed to reduce traffic in College
Terrace by erecting more stop signs in
the area.
At an open meeting at Lucille
Nixon School, the Committee agreed
to recommend to the Palo Alto City
Council a modified version of the plan
proposed by Councilman Alan
Henderson. The proposal recommends
that traffic signs, rather than barriers,
be erected in an attempt to reduce
traffic in the Terrace.
"The plan seems to be a good
solution to the problem of traffic in
the Terrace," declared Robert
Augsburger, University vice president

for business and finance and member
of the Committee. "It gives internal
protection to residents of the Terrace
and it permits the flow of traffic into
Stanford."
Augsburger explained that at a
public forum sponsored by the
Committee in January, he learned
Terrace residents are more concerned
about the speed of cars in the region
than about the volume of traffic.
"The use of more traffic signs is the
best solution possible," Charles
Walker, assistant Palo Alto city
manager, stated. "The advantages
outweigh the disadvantages."
No Boxing
Oscar Nelson, University master
planner, said * the Committee's
proposed solution would hamper
through traffic in the Terrace without
boxing in the area's residents.
"One reason why people used
Stanford Avenue rather than Page Mill
Road was that it is about two minutes
faster," Walker said. "With the stop
signs, it will probably take just as long
to use Stanford Avenue as to utilize
the Page Mill Road route."
Even though it might still be slightly
faster to use Stanford Avenue under
the proposed plan, the fact that people
would be forced to make frequent
starts and stops would discourage
them from using it, he predicted.
Barrier Plan
The plan endorsed by the
Committee calls for barriers to block
Cornell and Princeton at Stanford
Avenue and Columbia Bowdoin and
Amherst at College Avenue.
The plan would retain existing four
way stops at Hanover and California,
Bowdoin and Stanford and College
and Stanford. In addition to these, it
would add stops at the corners of
Yale, Wellesley and Oberlin at
Stanford Avenue and at the corners of
Williams and Princeton at California.
The Committee rejected a proposal
advocated by a few City Council

members that called for city
annexation of a 1/3-acre strip of
Stanford land. The plan, supported by
Vice Mayor Enid Pearson, would have
provided for construction of a road
between Amherst and Bowdoin at
Stanford Avenue. The road supposedly
would deflect traffic off of Stanford
Avenue.
Greenbelts
Augsburger said that the plan
advocated by Pearson would cut into
the University's greenbelts. "We set up
those greenbelts to provide visual open
space and to protect the people living
behind the green belts," Augsburger

explained.
City Manager George Sipel
reminded Augsburger that some
members of the Council have
threatened to refuse to annex the
University's Frenchman's Terrace
region until Stanford gives up the land.
The University wants to build a
housing project for low-moderate
income families in Frenchman's
Terrace, but has asked the city to
annex it and thereby assume
responsibility for its municipal
services.
Augsburger said that he saw no
interconnection between Frenchman's
Terrace and the College Terrace traffic
dilemma and refused to make
concessions to the city in order to
facilitate annexation of Frenchman's
Terrace.
"I hate to see a worthwhile project
blocked," Augsburger added, referring
to Frenchman's Terrace.
Sipel replied, "That is a reality we
must deal with. I would not want to
see the Frenchman's Terrace project
jeopardized by a traffic pattern."
"That is the council's decision,"
Augsburger concluded.
James Culpepper, chairman of the
College Terrace Resident's Association
expressed disappointment that the
Committee did not endorse the
association's proposal to reduce traffic
in the area by erecting a number of
permanent barricades.
