# Prof Addresses Police Symposium
## Kaplan Attacks Marijuana Laws 
### DAVID SMITH 
Like the Confederacy and the
Titanic, fighting marijuana use is a lost
cause, Law Prof. John Kaplan said
yesterday. But, he added, maybe that's
what makes it popular.
"I certainly wish that high-ranking
peace officers would stand up and say
of marijuana law enforcement, 'Let's
get it off our backs,' " Kaplan told a
symposium on law enforcement
meeting at the Cabana Hyatt House.
"Instead, most have treated it as a
law and order issue, and repeatedly
blasted marijuana law reform
proposals. I guess you always fight
harder in a losing battle," he told the
audience of 400 — most of them law
enforcement officials.
Harmless Drug?
"If marijuana were not harmful to
any of its users, it would be the only
completely harmless drug we know,"
stated Kaplan.
"It seems to me that it can be
dangerous. Considering that alcohol
harms about eight percent of its users,

while even according to its staunchest
opponents, marijuana harms only one
percent, though, the reasons for
keeping the drug criminal are no
longer in the rational realm.
"Marijuana law enforcement has
been expensive, inefficient, and
hopelessly arbitrary," Kaplan added.
"These laws have caused widespread
alienation between police and the
community they are supposed to
protect.
"The searches and seizures involved
in enforcing these laws has caused
profound discomfort; and although
marijuana law enforcement cost over
$85 million in California last year, 95
percent of those arrested for
possession were not even asked where
they bought the drugs."
700 Campus Dealers
Kaplan cited statistics showing that
47 percent of all Stanford students
smoke marijuana "regularly," and that
this level of use persists in youths of
all socio-economic classes.
Furthermore, according to Kaplan,
there are 700 drug dealers on the
Stanford campus, compared with only
three nearby liquor stores.
"It is one symptom of our present
marijuana laws that a person can only

deal to people he knows; anyone else
might be a 'narc,'" said Kaplan.
"Since people who like marijuana and
want to sell it must turn to the
hard-core 'drug culture' for their
supply, many are introduced to harder
drugs through their contacts.
"If education is the ultimate cure
for our hard-drug problem, our
marijuana statutes are hindering the
solution," Kaplan warned. "Most kids
aren't ready to believe the horror
stories that some drug educators tell
about marijuana, because they know
people who smoke it.
"But then they won't believe the
true stories about hard drugs, either.
Drug education officials who
emphasize that marijuana use is not
'bad' will usually lose their jobs," he
continued.
Kaplan also turned his attention to
other "victimless" crimes. "They're
better called 'consensual' crimes," he
said, "because they all involve
transactions between consenting
individuals.
"The great majority of these
offenses, covered by such measures as
the minimum wage law and rules for
mandatory seat belts in automobiles,
pose no major problem to society."

enforcement officials.
Harmless Drug?
"If marijuana were not harmful to
any of its users, it would be the only
completely harmless drug we know,"
stated Kaplan.
"It seems to me that it can be
dangerous. Considering that alcohol
harms about eight percent of its users,

while even according to its staunchest
opponents, marijuana harms only one
percent, though, the reasons for
keeping the drug criminal are no
longer in the rational realm.
"Marijuana law enforcement has
been expensive, inefficient, and
hopelessly arbitrary," Kaplan added.
"These laws have caused widespread
alienation between police and the
community they are supposed to
protect.
"The searches and seizures involved
in enforcing these laws has caused
profound discomfort; and although
marijuana law enforcement cost over
$85 million in California last year, 95
percent of those arrested for
possession were not even asked where
they bought the drugs."
700 Campus Dealers
Kaplan cited statistics showing that
47 percent of all Stanford students
smoke marijuana "regularly," and that
this level of use persists in youths of
all socio-economic classes.
Furthermore, according to Kaplan,
there are 700 drug dealers on the
Stanford campus, compared with only
three nearby liquor stores.
"It is one symptom of our present
marijuana laws that a person can only

deal to people he knows; anyone else
might be a 'narc,'" said Kaplan.
"Since people who like marijuana and
want to sell it must turn to the
hard-core 'drug culture' for their
supply, many are introduced to harder
drugs through their contacts.
"If education is the ultimate cure
for our hard-drug problem, our
marijuana statutes are hindering the
solution," Kaplan warned. "Most kids
aren't ready to believe the horror
stories that some drug educators tell
about marijuana, because they know
people who smoke it.
"But then they won't believe the
true stories about hard drugs, either.
Drug education officials who
emphasize that marijuana use is not
'bad' will usually lose their jobs," he
continued.
Kaplan also turned his attention to
other "victimless" crimes. "They're
better called 'consensual' crimes," he
said, "because they all involve
transactions between consenting
individuals.
"The great majority of these
offenses, covered by such measures as
the minimum wage law and rules for
mandatory seat belts in automobiles,
pose no major problem to society."

MARIJUANA LAW REFORMER — Law Prof. John Kaplan told a symposium
of law enforcement officials yesterday that marijuana laws have caused
widespread alienation between police and the community they are supposed to
protect." Speaking at the Cabana Hyatt House in Palo Alto, Kaplan also cited
that marijuana law enforcement costs Californians $85 million annually and that
47 percent of students here smoke the weed "regularly."
Like the Confederacy and the
Titanic, fighting marijuana use is a lost
cause, Law Prof. John Kaplan said
yesterday. But, he added, maybe that's
what makes it popular.
"I certainly wish that high-ranking
peace officers would stand up and say
of marijuana law enforcement, 'Let's
get it off our backs,' " Kaplan told a
symposium on law enforcement
meeting at the Cabana Hyatt House.
"Instead, most have treated it as a
law and order issue, and repeatedly
blasted marijuana law reform
proposals. I guess you always fight
harder in a losing battle," he told the
audience of 400 — most of them law
enforcement officials.
