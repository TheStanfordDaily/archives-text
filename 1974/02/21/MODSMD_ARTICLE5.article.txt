# Former Administrator Here
## Arnett Still Helps University 
### ROBERT BACON First of Two Parts 
SACRAMENTO — Dixon Arnett used to go to
Sacramento to present the University's concerns to state
legislators. Now his successors at Stanford take their
government-related interests to Assemblyman Dixon
Arnett.
The University's director of community relations from
1966-70, representative of the 26th Assembly District since
1971, Arnett still pays considerable attention to his former
employer.
On University-related issues, "my thoughts haven't
changed much, even though my job has," he told the Daily
at the State Capitol last week.
The Redwood City Republican has sponsored legislation
on the University's behalf relating to financial aids, building
construction, police, and land development.
Frequent Contact
He noted that he is in frequent contact with the staff of
the University Relations Office, particularly Robert
Freelen, director of government relations, and Andy Doty,
Arnett's successor as director of community relations.
His contacts with others in the Stanford community are
less frequent. "Relatively frequently — two or three times a
year" he serves as a guest classroom lecturer. He has worked
with the Medical School on health care proposals and with
the Communication Department with respect to cable
television, among others, he explained.
Controversial Ordinance
Turning to specific issues, Arnett attacked the
controversial Santa Clara County urban service areas
ordinance, which but for a compromise reached in January
would have given the city of Palo Alto planning authority
over the central campus.

"I think local government is extending beyond its need
in this case," Arnett said, claiming the ordinance was
probably unconstitutional. He claimed it delegated
authority of planning unincorporated areas from the
county to the cities.
He pointed to the fact that Stanford provides its own
utilities, public works, and police and fire protection as
proof that municipal planning controls over the campus
were unnecessary.
He opined that "contention will forever exist" between
the needs — especially financial — of the University and the
opposition of adjacent communities to development of
University lands.
Land Or Students?
Arnett, whose district covers the southern half of San
Mateo County, including Menlo Park, Woodside, Portola
Valley and the University foothill lands (but not including
the central campus or Palo Alto), posed the question "what
is the resource to be protected — land or students?
"There's no easy answer to the competing viewpoints,"
he said; then he described as "potent" the argument that
the University needs income from development of its lands.
Turning to the related problem of housing on the
midpeninsula, Arnett insisted that study of the effects of
new job-creating enterprises on the local housing market
must be made a part of the planning process. Such planning
in the past might have prevented much of the problem now
in existence, he suggested.
But as to the present situation, he was less sanguine. The
government can't require major enterprises — businesses or
non-profit institutions like Stanford — to "go into the
housing business," he said, because "it's money off the
top" — reduced profits for a corporation, reduced net
income for the University.
Financial Aid
Arnett described as "absolutely critical" the financial
crisis of private higher education. Massive programs of
student financial aid by the federal and state governments
are necessary, he insisted, to keep some institutions out of
bankruptcy and to keep major universities from declining.
A wholesale revision of federal and state laws to
amalgamate the many scholarship programs presently
available would be an important step, he said. This would
cut administrative costs, increase funds available to
students, and reduce the bureaucratic confusion and
uncertainty facing the student.
How realistic is this? "Difficult at best. It requires action
by Congress," which has in the past opted for a variety of
small, independent programs "usually at the expense of the

large states," Arnett noted.
He said that he and other legislators were attempting to
pressure Congress by putting California on record in
support of such a proposal.
In the meantime, he said, what the state can do is "just a
drop in the bucket." He is currently sponsoring a bill to
make $1.5 million in equal opportunity program funds
available to low-income students at private as well as state
colleges and universities.
In 1972 an Arnett-sponsored bill was enacted authorizing
private universities to issue tax-exempt bonds for building
construction, permitting them to borrow money at lower
interest rates than they could through private channels.
But public scholarships "are the most immediate,
substantial influx of funds" available to universities such as
Stanford, he explained.
