# FCC Turns Down KZSU In Power Increase Bid
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) has rejected
KZSU's request for a power increase
from 10 to 500 watts.
In a letter to Stanford's Board of
Trustees — KZSU's legal owner —
Wallace Johnson, chief of the FCC's
broadcast bureau, cited potential
interference with Foothill College's
KFJC as the reason for dismissing the
application for a power boost.
KZSU Station Manager Gary
Fazzino said that KZSU personnel
were "really disappointed" with the
decision. He said that they had
received unofficial advance word of
the dismissal two weeks ago, so the
letter was no surprise.
"It was fairly obvious because of
the long delay," Fazzino added. The
latest proposal was originally
submitted in January, 1973.
KZSU's request "was inadvertently
accepted" for further consideration
last March, when it was determined
that the power increase would not
cause interference to adjacent

channel stations, the FCC letter said.
In September, the power boost
application was indefinitely delayed
because of the KFJC's opposition.
At that time, KFJC Program
Director Tod Brooks said, "The only
reason we filed the objection is that
we think they're going to move into
our coverage."
KFJC's objection claimed that a
stronger KZSU signal would block out
the KFJC signal in areas of Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Atherton.
KFJC also cited an FCC ruling that
transmitters for commercial stations
must be located at least 15 miles apart
while the KZSU and KFJC
transmitters are about nine miles
apart.
The Foothill station operates a
10-watt transmitter, but has an
effective radiated power equivalent to
39 watts because its transmitter is
1829 feet above average terrain,
whereas KZSU's transmitter is 13 feet
below average. The FCC letter said
that because of the actual range of

KFJC's signal, KZSU's proposed
increase would cause "objectionable
interference."
Even though KFJC's actual range is
much greater than its transmitter
power would indicate, the station
apparently does not violate any of the
FCC's technical requirements. KZSU
had requested that appropriate action
be taken to reduce KFJC's power.
KZSU Business Manager Lloyd
Snook said that KZSU's signal
interferes with KFJC now, but added
that the opposite may not be true for
technical reasons.
KZSU had argued that the FCC had
operated on a 100 feet above terrain
assumption to determine if there
would be any interference between the
stations in three previous situations.
In September, Snook said that
KZSU wanted the FCC to continue to
use its assumed figure and therefore
grant the increase.
Snook added, "The reason we went
for the power increase was that some
50 percent of all Stanford students live
more than 3 I A miles away from
campus. Fifty percent of the faculty
and staff live more than 4'/2 miles from
campus.
"With a six-mile signal-radius, this
means there is a significant part of the
Stanford community we're not
reaching." Snook estimated that the
power increase would expand the
signal radius to 12 miles and increase
the area of coverage four times.
After receiving the FCC's letter,
Snook said that KZSU will not take
any further action "until we talk to
University lawyers."
Jona Denz, publicity director of
KFJC, said that her station's
management was "somewhat relieved"
with the decision. "If we weren't so
close there wouldn't be any hassle,"
she noted.

more than 3 I A miles away from
campus. Fifty percent of the faculty
and staff live more than 4'/2 miles from
campus.
"With a six-mile signal-radius, this
means there is a significant part of the
Stanford community we're not
reaching." Snook estimated that the
power increase would expand the
signal radius to 12 miles and increase
the area of coverage four times.
After receiving the FCC's letter,
Snook said that KZSU will not take
any further action "until we talk to
University lawyers."
Jona Denz, publicity director of
KFJC, said that her station's
management was "somewhat relieved"
with the decision. "If we weren't so
close there wouldn't be any hassle,"
she noted.
The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) has rejected
KZSU's request for a power increase
from 10 to 500 watts.
In a letter to Stanford's Board of
Trustees — KZSU's legal owner —
Wallace Johnson, chief of the FCC's
broadcast bureau, cited potential
interference with Foothill College's
KFJC as the reason for dismissing the
application for a power boost.
KZSU Station Manager Gary
Fazzino said that KZSU personnel
were "really disappointed" with the
decision. He said that they had
received unofficial advance word of
the dismissal two weeks ago, so the
letter was no surprise.
"It was fairly obvious because of
the long delay," Fazzino added. The
latest proposal was originally
submitted in January, 1973.
KZSU's request "was inadvertently
accepted" for further consideration
last March, when it was determined
that the power increase would not
cause interference to adjacent

channel stations, the FCC letter said.
In September, the power boost
application was indefinitely delayed
because of the KFJC's opposition.
At that time, KFJC Program
Director Tod Brooks said, "The only
reason we filed the objection is that
we think they're going to move into
our coverage."
KFJC's objection claimed that a
stronger KZSU signal would block out
the KFJC signal in areas of Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Atherton.
KFJC also cited an FCC ruling that
transmitters for commercial stations
must be located at least 15 miles apart
while the KZSU and KFJC
transmitters are about nine miles
apart.
The Foothill station operates a
10-watt transmitter, but has an
effective radiated power equivalent to
39 watts because its transmitter is
1829 feet above average terrain,
whereas KZSU's transmitter is 13 feet
below average. The FCC letter said
that because of the actual range of

KFJC's signal, KZSU's proposed
increase would cause "objectionable
interference."
Even though KFJC's actual range is
much greater than its transmitter
power would indicate, the station
apparently does not violate any of the
FCC's technical requirements. KZSU
had requested that appropriate action
be taken to reduce KFJC's power.
KZSU Business Manager Lloyd
Snook said that KZSU's signal
interferes with KFJC now, but added
that the opposite may not be true for
technical reasons.
KZSU had argued that the FCC had
operated on a 100 feet above terrain
assumption to determine if there
would be any interference between the
stations in three previous situations.
In September, Snook said that
KZSU wanted the FCC to continue to
use its assumed figure and therefore
grant the increase.
Snook added, "The reason we went
for the power increase was that some
50 percent of all Stanford students live
more than 3 I A miles away from
campus. Fifty percent of the faculty
and staff live more than 4'/2 miles from
campus.
