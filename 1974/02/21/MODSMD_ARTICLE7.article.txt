French Program
Editor:
I was interested in reading the
Daily article about the French
program being moved to Paris
next year, and Stanford students
taking courses at Paris University.
However, recall that that tuition
fees in French universities, despite
a considerable increase in recent
years, are still about $35 a year.
That is, approximately 1 percent
of Stanford figures.
I would like to know if
Stanford is going to offer free
registration to as many French
students as there will be Stanford
students studying in Paris.
In most European countries,
high education is considered a
right, rather than a luxury
Involving many-digit prices.
Traditionally, foreign students
have been welcome to share the
same privileges as French students
— provided they had the required
level of competence — at the
expense of French taxpayers. I
highly favor this liberalism.
Nevertheless, when these same
taxpayers have to pay
astronomical fees to foreign
universities for their nationals
studying there, I think they
behave too generously. I hope
that, some day, some notion of
reciprocality will be applied to the
matters of international
educational relations.

Teaching Awards
Editor:
In spring students, faculty and
staff will have an opportunity to
recommend candidates for the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Awards and
the Walter J. Gores Faculty
Achievement Awards. These
prizes serve to remind us all of the
University's concern for
distinction in teaching at all levels
and for those special
contributions which
undergraduates as well as staff and
faculty make to the quality of
undergraduate education.
We believe there is excellence
in teaching at Stanford — teaching
understood in its broadest sense —
whether in the classroom, at the
laboratory bench or in the
advisor's office. There is
excellence in teaching fellows and
assistants. And, we believe that
special efforts of faculty, staff and
students daily improve the general
experience of undergraduates at
Stanford.
Our task as a committee this
year is to identify those persons
to whom special awards should be
made. We cannot do that alone.
The call for recommendations,
which will be made shortly, is a
call to each member of the
University. We look to students,
staff and faculty to tell us of
contributions that otherwise
might pass unnoticed.Take note of
the announcements of these
awards and act to help us.

Sandra Traversa, Secretary
Syphilis Study
Editor:
On Tuesday, Feb. 12, a paper
of mine that appeared in Stanford
M.D. was discussed under the title
"Prof Criticizes Reaction to
Syphilis Study." The article was
accurate except for the third
paragraph from the end where
misleading statements do appear.
It is stated in that paragraph
that it was common not to treat
for latent syphilis, before
penicillin was available, because of
severe reactions produced by the
drugs used. It is true that a great
many patients dropped out of
treatment because of reactions,
but this was against medical

advice and not because of it, as is
implied in the text.
It was further stated that the
Stanford Clinic stopped treating
for latent syphilis in the 19305.
This is untrue. It is true that a few
elderly patients with infections of
long duration were left untreated
because it was felt that they
would not develop late syphilitic
disease. In addition it was known
that treatment would not
certainly prevent such late lesions
and that it was not proved that
the incidence of such lesions
could even be reduced
significantly by therapy.

Searsville Road
Editor:
I should like to reply to the
letter from Professor Robert Cohn
decrying the construction of an
asphalt bike-way along Searsville
Road as a blight on that beautiful
country lane. Searsville Road was,
and in my opinion still is, a lovely
stretch of wooded lane.
However, prior to the
construction of the bike-way, it
was all but impassable to those of
us who prefer bicycles to
automobiles as a means of
transportation to and from
school, and who generally enjoy
riding in and around campus.
I might add that, like Professor
Cohn, I am deeply concerned with
preserving environmental
amenities — I am intensely
interested in environmental law,
have worked with the Natural
Resources Defense Council (a
public interest, environmental law
firm), and upon graduation from
law school this year, will go to
work with the Lands and Natural
Resources Division of the Justice
Department. I too have a certain
natural aversion to asphalt in a
pristine setting. But on balance, I
believe that the bike-way has a
minimum adverse effect on the
beauty of Searsville Road, and at
the same time, makes that beauty
more readily accessible to all of
us.

More On 'Streaking'
Editor:
I have been following the
recent article and letters on
"streaking." Professor Cerf is to
be commended for his wit and
clear thinking. In reply to James
Peterson's letter, which at first I
found hard to take seriously, I
raise the following questions:
1. Is a man to be judged
"flippant" because he makes puns
while advocating tolerance?
2. Who is to judge whose
attitudes are "warped"?
3. By what standards is an act
"sick" or "degenerate"?
4. What is the "high moral
purpose" of Stanford and how is
it impeded by the streakers?
5. Exactly what steps is
Peterson suggesting the University
take to "protect" itself from these
harmless pranksters? I certainly
hope he isn't suggesting that the
police waste time harassing the
streakers for their victimless
"crimes."
My most positive impression
upon my arrival at Stanford was
the high degree of acceptance by
members of the Stanford
community of one another's
individuality and differing
life-styles. May this attitude of
tolerance never bow to pressures
from a vocal minority crying to
stamp out "permissiveness," for in
each attempt to fight
permissiveness we lose a little of
the precious freedom which
makes this university great.

Teaching Awards
Editor:
In spring students, faculty and
staff will have an opportunity to
recommend candidates for the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Awards and
the Walter J. Gores Faculty
Achievement Awards. These
prizes serve to remind us all of the
University's concern for
distinction in teaching at all levels
and for those special
contributions which
undergraduates as well as staff and
faculty make to the quality of
undergraduate education.
We believe there is excellence
in teaching at Stanford — teaching
understood in its broadest sense —
whether in the classroom, at the
laboratory bench or in the
advisor's office. There is
excellence in teaching fellows and
assistants. And, we believe that
special efforts of faculty, staff and
students daily improve the general
experience of undergraduates at
Stanford.
Our task as a committee this
year is to identify those persons
to whom special awards should be
made. We cannot do that alone.
The call for recommendations,
which will be made shortly, is a
call to each member of the
University. We look to students,
staff and faculty to tell us of
contributions that otherwise
might pass unnoticed.Take note of
the announcements of these
awards and act to help us.

Editor:
On Tuesday, Feb. 12, a paper
of mine that appeared in Stanford
M.D. was discussed under the title
"Prof Criticizes Reaction to
Syphilis Study." The article was
accurate except for the third
paragraph from the end where
misleading statements do appear.
It is stated in that paragraph
that it was common not to treat
for latent syphilis, before
penicillin was available, because of
severe reactions produced by the
drugs used. It is true that a great
many patients dropped out of
treatment because of reactions,
but this was against medical

advice and not because of it, as is
implied in the text.
It was further stated that the
Stanford Clinic stopped treating
for latent syphilis in the 19305.
This is untrue. It is true that a few
elderly patients with infections of
long duration were left untreated
because it was felt that they
would not develop late syphilitic
disease. In addition it was known
that treatment would not
certainly prevent such late lesions
and that it was not proved that
the incidence of such lesions
could even be reduced
significantly by therapy.

Searsville Road
Editor:
I should like to reply to the
letter from Professor Robert Cohn
decrying the construction of an
asphalt bike-way along Searsville
Road as a blight on that beautiful
country lane. Searsville Road was,
and in my opinion still is, a lovely
stretch of wooded lane.
However, prior to the
construction of the bike-way, it
was all but impassable to those of
us who prefer bicycles to
automobiles as a means of
transportation to and from
school, and who generally enjoy
riding in and around campus.
I might add that, like Professor
Cohn, I am deeply concerned with
preserving environmental
amenities — I am intensely
interested in environmental law,
have worked with the Natural
Resources Defense Council (a
public interest, environmental law
firm), and upon graduation from
law school this year, will go to
work with the Lands and Natural
Resources Division of the Justice
Department. I too have a certain
natural aversion to asphalt in a
pristine setting. But on balance, I
believe that the bike-way has a
minimum adverse effect on the
beauty of Searsville Road, and at
the same time, makes that beauty
more readily accessible to all of
us.

More On 'Streaking'
Editor:
I have been following the
recent article and letters on
"streaking." Professor Cerf is to
be commended for his wit and
clear thinking. In reply to James
Peterson's letter, which at first I
found hard to take seriously, I
raise the following questions:
1. Is a man to be judged
"flippant" because he makes puns
while advocating tolerance?
2. Who is to judge whose
attitudes are "warped"?
3. By what standards is an act
"sick" or "degenerate"?
4. What is the "high moral
purpose" of Stanford and how is
it impeded by the streakers?
5. Exactly what steps is
Peterson suggesting the University
take to "protect" itself from these
harmless pranksters? I certainly
hope he isn't suggesting that the
police waste time harassing the
streakers for their victimless
"crimes."
My most positive impression
upon my arrival at Stanford was
the high degree of acceptance by
members of the Stanford
community of one another's
individuality and differing
life-styles. May this attitude of
tolerance never bow to pressures
from a vocal minority crying to
stamp out "permissiveness," for in
each attempt to fight
permissiveness we lose a little of
the precious freedom which

Teaching Awards
Editor:
In spring students, faculty and
staff will have an opportunity to
recommend candidates for the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Awards and
the Walter J. Gores Faculty
Achievement Awards. These
prizes serve to remind us all of the
University's concern for
distinction in teaching at all levels
and for those special
contributions which
undergraduates as well as staff and
faculty make to the quality of
undergraduate education.
We believe there is excellence
in teaching at Stanford — teaching
understood in its broadest sense —
whether in the classroom, at the
laboratory bench or in the
advisor's office. There is
excellence in teaching fellows and
assistants. And, we believe that
special efforts of faculty, staff and
students daily improve the general
experience of undergraduates at
Stanford.
Our task as a committee this
year is to identify those persons
to whom special awards should be
made. We cannot do that alone.
The call for recommendations,
which will be made shortly, is a
call to each member of the
University. We look to students,
staff and faculty to tell us of
contributions that otherwise
might pass unnoticed.Take note of
the announcements of these
awards and act to help us.

Sandra Traversa, Secretary

Editor:
On Tuesday, Feb. 12, a paper
of mine that appeared in Stanford
M.D. was discussed under the title
"Prof Criticizes Reaction to
Syphilis Study." The article was
accurate except for the third
paragraph from the end where
misleading statements do appear.
It is stated in that paragraph
that it was common not to treat
for latent syphilis, before
penicillin was available, because of
severe reactions produced by the
drugs used. It is true that a great
many patients dropped out of
treatment because of reactions,
but this was against medical

advice and not because of it, as is
implied in the text.
It was further stated that the
Stanford Clinic stopped treating
for latent syphilis in the 19305.
This is untrue. It is true that a few
elderly patients with infections of
long duration were left untreated
because it was felt that they
would not develop late syphilitic
disease. In addition it was known
that treatment would not
certainly prevent such late lesions
and that it was not proved that
the incidence of such lesions
could even be reduced
significantly by therapy.

Searsville Road
Editor:
I should like to reply to the
letter from Professor Robert Cohn
decrying the construction of an
asphalt bike-way along Searsville
Road as a blight on that beautiful
country lane. Searsville Road was,
and in my opinion still is, a lovely
stretch of wooded lane.
However, prior to the
construction of the bike-way, it
was all but impassable to those of
us who prefer bicycles to
automobiles as a means of
transportation to and from
school, and who generally enjoy
riding in and around campus.
I might add that, like Professor
Cohn, I am deeply concerned with
preserving environmental
amenities — I am intensely
interested in environmental law,
have worked with the Natural
Resources Defense Council (a
public interest, environmental law
firm), and upon graduation from
law school this year, will go to
work with the Lands and Natural
Resources Division of the Justice
Department. I too have a certain
natural aversion to asphalt in a
pristine setting. But on balance, I
believe that the bike-way has a
minimum adverse effect on the
beauty of Searsville Road, and at
the same time, makes that beauty
more readily accessible to all of
us.

More On 'Streaking'
Editor:
I have been following the
recent article and letters on
"streaking." Professor Cerf is to
be commended for his wit and
clear thinking. In reply to James
Peterson's letter, which at first I
found hard to take seriously, I
raise the following questions:
1. Is a man to be judged
"flippant" because he makes puns
while advocating tolerance?
2. Who is to judge whose
attitudes are "warped"?
3. By what standards is an act
"sick" or "degenerate"?
4. What is the "high moral
purpose" of Stanford and how is
it impeded by the streakers?
5. Exactly what steps is
Peterson suggesting the University
take to "protect" itself from these
harmless pranksters? I certainly
hope he isn't suggesting that the
police waste time harassing the
streakers for their victimless
"crimes."
My most positive impression
upon my arrival at Stanford was
the high degree of acceptance by
members of the Stanford
community of one another's
individuality and differing
life-styles. May this attitude of
tolerance never bow to pressures
from a vocal minority crying to
stamp out "permissiveness," for in
each attempt to fight
permissiveness we lose a little of
the precious freedom which
makes this university great.

French Program
Editor:
I was interested in reading the
Daily article about the French
program being moved to Paris
next year, and Stanford students
taking courses at Paris University.
However, recall that that tuition
fees in French universities, despite
a considerable increase in recent
years, are still about $35 a year.
That is, approximately 1 percent
of Stanford figures.
I would like to know if
Stanford is going to offer free
registration to as many French
students as there will be Stanford
students studying in Paris.
In most European countries,
high education is considered a
right, rather than a luxury
Involving many-digit prices.
Traditionally, foreign students
have been welcome to share the
same privileges as French students
— provided they had the required
level of competence — at the
expense of French taxpayers. I
highly favor this liberalism.
Nevertheless, when these same
taxpayers have to pay
astronomical fees to foreign
universities for their nationals
studying there, I think they
behave too generously. I hope
that, some day, some notion of
reciprocality will be applied to the
matters of international
educational relations.
