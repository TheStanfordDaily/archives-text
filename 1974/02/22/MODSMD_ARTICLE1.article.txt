# GOP 'Will Not Suffer' From Watergate
## Flournoy Claims Broad Party Appeal 
### JIM WASCHER 
State Controller Houston I.
Flournoy, a candidate for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination,
said at a press conference here
yesterday that "the broad spectrum of
the Republican Party has concluded
that I am the best candidate they can
put forward from among those
available."
Flournoy spoke to the press shortly
before addressing about 75 people at
Tresidder Union in a question and
answer session sponsored by the
ASSU, The California Republican

League and the Stanford Young
Republicans.
Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, and
former Stanford Trustee David
Packard have both endorsed Flournoy,
whose only announced opponent in
the Republican primary is Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke.
Although Flournoy believes that
the Watergate scandal will make voters
"more skeptical of all candidates and
make them harder to convince," he
told reporters "I don't think
Republicans will suffer unduly."
Focus On Candidates
Flournoy told his Tresidder
audience that the state's voters "tend
very much to focus on the behavior of
candidates," rather than on the record
of either party.
He said the fact that certain leading
Republicans "are probably going to be
in jail" by election day in November is
"not going to be a key determinant of
how they [the voters] vote and in
whom they are going to entrust the
leadership of this state."
Flournoy said he has raised
$250,000 for his campaign, asserting
that the largest contribution he had
received was for $6500. "I haven't had
the problem of turning down bigger
contributions," he said.
Limit Expenditures
Because he believes that "the idea
of limiting government expenditures in
proportion to individual income is a
good one," Flournoy said he
supported Gov. Ronald Reagan's
controversial Proposition One last
November.
The proposition, which voters
soundly defeated on Nov. 6, called for
a ceiling on the amount the state
legislature can raise through taxation.
The ceiling would have been 8.75
percent of the state's total personal
income the first year, declining .1
percent annually until 1989.

Flournoy said he "was never quite
happy about putting it into the
constitution," as the proposition
would have done. He added that the
current proposal to enact the tax
ceiling as a law is "far more
preferable."
Tax Limitation
According to Flournoy, "the
governor has the opportunity to set
that standard [of tax limitation] for
himself without the statute and he has
the tools to live up to it."
Flournoy is closing out his second
term as state controller. Previously, he
served three terms in the state
Assembly while teaching government
at Pomona Collpge and the Claremont
Graduate School.
Answering questions from his
audience at Tresidder, Flournoy said

that the decriminalization of victimless
crimes such as marijuana possession
was "not any area that has any
pressing urgency." However, he said
arrests under these statutes was "not
the number one law enforcement
priority" in the state.
Lower Drinking Age
"I really don't find much to quarrel
with in the existing law on marijuana,"
Flournoy said, explaining his
opposition to the proposed California
Marijuana Initiative. However, he
added that he does favor legislation
lowering the state drinking age to 18.
In analyzing the impact that the
energy crisis will have on the ecology
movement, Flournoy said "in many
ways, the most important time for
environmental concerns is going to be
right now."

leadership of this state."
Flournoy said he has raised
$250,000 for his campaign, asserting
that the largest contribution he had
received was for $6500. "I haven't had
the problem of turning down bigger
contributions," he said.
Limit Expenditures
Because he believes that "the idea
of limiting government expenditures in
proportion to individual income is a
good one," Flournoy said he
supported Gov. Ronald Reagan's
controversial Proposition One last
November.
The proposition, which voters
soundly defeated on Nov. 6, called for
a ceiling on the amount the state
legislature can raise through taxation.
The ceiling would have been 8.75
percent of the state's total personal
income the first year, declining .1
percent annually until 1989.

Flournoy said he "was never quite
happy about putting it into the
constitution," as the proposition
would have done. He added that the
current proposal to enact the tax
ceiling as a law is "far more
preferable."
Tax Limitation
According to Flournoy, "the
governor has the opportunity to set
that standard [of tax limitation] for
himself without the statute and he has
the tools to live up to it."
Flournoy is closing out his second
term as state controller. Previously, he
served three terms in the state
Assembly while teaching government
at Pomona Collpge and the Claremont
Graduate School.
Answering questions from his
audience at Tresidder, Flournoy said

that the decriminalization of victimless
crimes such as marijuana possession
was "not any area that has any
pressing urgency." However, he said
arrests under these statutes was "not
the number one law enforcement
priority" in the state.
Lower Drinking Age
"I really don't find much to quarrel
with in the existing law on marijuana,"
Flournoy said, explaining his
opposition to the proposed California
Marijuana Initiative. However, he
added that he does favor legislation
lowering the state drinking age to 18.
In analyzing the impact that the
energy crisis will have on the ecology
movement, Flournoy said "in many
ways, the most important time for
environmental concerns is going to be
right now."

GOP CANDIDATE — Houston I. Flournoy, a candidate for the Republican
nomination for governor, spoke to the press and a crowd of 75 in Tresidder
yesterday. Flournoy said he was confident that voters would judge individual
candidates rather than party reputations in a state election.
State Controller Houston I.
Flournoy, a candidate for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination,
said at a press conference here
yesterday that "the broad spectrum of
the Republican Party has concluded
that I am the best candidate they can
put forward from among those
available."
Flournoy spoke to the press shortly
before addressing about 75 people at
Tresidder Union in a question and
answer session sponsored by the
ASSU, The California Republican

League and the Stanford Young
Republicans.
Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, and
former Stanford Trustee David
Packard have both endorsed Flournoy,
whose only announced opponent in
the Republican primary is Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke.
Although Flournoy believes that
the Watergate scandal will make voters
"more skeptical of all candidates and
make them harder to convince," he
told reporters "I don't think
Republicans will suffer unduly."
Focus On Candidates
Flournoy told his Tresidder
audience that the state's voters "tend
very much to focus on the behavior of
candidates," rather than on the record
of either party.
He said the fact that certain leading
Republicans "are probably going to be
in jail" by election day in November is
"not going to be a key determinant of
how they [the voters] vote and in
whom they are going to entrust the
leadership of this state."
Flournoy said he has raised
$250,000 for his campaign, asserting
