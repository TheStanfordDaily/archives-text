# College Terrace Traffic Solution

The Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committe met this week to discuss the
problem of the heavy traffic in College
Terrace and proposed a solution to the City
Council.
After covering the Terrace traffic situation
for the Daily during the past month, I can
only guess that the City Council's eventual
decision will not totally satisfy very many
people.
The trouble with the Terrace traffic
dilemma is that almost everyone affected by
it has his own plan for its solution. Most
so-called plans are designed to fit the needs
of the individual planner without
consideration for the needs of other people.
Hence, any workable solution must involve a
synthesis of various individual problems.
Compromise is essential.
College Terrace, a region of Palo Alto
bordered on three sides by the University,
has been plagued in recent years by a
tremendous increase of traffic on its streets.
Hanover Street, for example, has a daily
traffic burden of 2500 cars, although as a
residental area it should be used by no more
than 500 cars each day. While some residents
claim that the traffic is not bothersome, most
agree that the noise and danger to
neighborhood children have reached a
dangerous level.
Barriers erected last September at certain
key intersections have proven to be
ineffectual in reducing the volume of traffic.
It is clear that the Palo Alto City Council
must develop a new program for reducing
traffic in the area. Since 300 Stanford
students and 140 faculty and staff members
in the Terrace, and another 300 Stanford
students living in Escondido Village use roads
bordering the area, it is appropriate that the
University be consulted in an attempt to
develop a solution for the traffic dilemma.
It was in this spirit of compromise that

Vice Mayor Enid Pearson last month
suggested to the council that the Liaison
Committee discuss the issue. Due to the
tremendous public concern with the matter,
it is encouraging that the committee allowed
the public to attend the meeting, contrary to
its usual procedure.
One of the plans the committee studied
was a proposal of the College Terrace
Resident's Association that several of the
streets bordering Stanford Avenue and
California Avenue be closed to through
traffic. Although the goal of the plan — to
reduce traffic in the area — is supported by
almost all Terrace residents, a large
proportion of the people in the area oppose
the closing of the streets. They point out that
if one street is blocked, the traffic excluded
from it will only be transferred to other
streets. This complaint seems valid. If more
barriers were constructed, traffic would
become worse in many areas, including the
Stanford campus.
Many individual problems would be
created by the barriers. An 86-year-old
Stanford professor living in the Terrace has
noted that barriers would force a change in
the bus route, causing him considerable
inconvenience. The effectiveness of the Palo
Alto-University Mutual Aid Agreement for
fire and police protection would be
diminished. Access to two student churches
would become extremely difficult. Barriers
would also force many Terrace residents
commuting to work to join the heavy traffic
on El Camino Real.
Barriers do not seem to be the best way to
solve the problem of traffic on the Terrace.
Nor does the plan submitted by Vice Mayor
Pearson have much merit. Pearson has
suggested that the city annex a third of an
acre of Stanford land at the corner of
Stanford and Bowdoin, allowing the city to
build a road that would deflect traffic off

Stanford Avenue and onto Bowdoin. Aside
from the fact that this plan would only
increase the traffic burden on Bowdoin, it
seems unreasonable for the University to be
asked to surrender part of the territory when
no traffic expert has supported the view that
Pearson's plan would ameliorate the traffic
dilemma.
A large obstacle to a solution of the
problem is the selfishness of many of the
residents of the locality. For example,
non-residents don't want to have barriers
erected in the Terrace because the find its
streets a convenient access to El Camino
Real. Hopefully, non-residents should use
Page Mill Road rather than Stanford Avenue
(bordering the Terrace) even if no barriers are
set up. The Page Mill Road route would take
only a minute longer than the Stanford
Avenue route and it would relieve the
residents of College Terrace of much of the
region's alien traffic. Pine Hill residents
should be willing to make this small sacrifice.
After reviewing several of the proposals
for reducing College Terrace's traffic burden,
the Committee endorsed the most viable plan
— the construction of more traffic signals in
the Terrace. These would make it less
advantageous for residents living outside the
College Terrace area to use its streets. The
plan would reduce the speed of traffic in the
region, making the streets quieter and safer,
but keeping access to Stanford open.
But no plan is going to remedy every
individual problem in its entirety. If the
residents of the region are going to achieve
any solution to the traffic problem, they will
have to face this fact and approach its
upcoming deliberations of the problem
willing to make concessions to their
neighbors.
