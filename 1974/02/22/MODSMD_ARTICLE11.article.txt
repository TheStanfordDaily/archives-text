# Mondale In '76?
## 
### 
Textor, Levin,
Kirst

We have all known Sen. Walter
F. Mondale, D— Minn., at one time
or another and commend him to
your attention as solid
Presidential timber for the 1976
elections. {
Textor knew Mondale when
the two of them were members of
a student study group in Europe.
He was deeply impressed by
Mondale's genuine idealism
blended with astute practical
political skills. Mondale, although
barely old enough to vote, had
already taken practical leadership
in civil rights at a time when few
whites knew or cared much about
this issue. It was evident, even
then, that he was marked for
important national service.
Levin worked with Mondale
recently as consultant to the
Select Senate Committee on
Equal Educational Opportunity,
of which Mondale was chairman.
His genuine dedication to the
plight of youngsters drawn from
low-income and racially
segregated backgrounds, in
conjunction with his ability to
assimilate highly complex social
science analysis presented to his
committee, made a strong impact
on Levin. This combination of
humanitarian concern and strong
analytic insight is extremely rare
in the political forum.
Impressed By Mondale
Kirst was Staff Director of the
Senate Subcommittee on
Employment, Manpower, and
Poverty. He travelled with
Mondale, a committee member, to
oversee federal manpower and
poverty programs. He was
impressed by Mondale's ability to
separate good intentions from
well administered programs.
He also admired Mondale's
legislative leadership and noted
the high respect his colleagues in
the Senate held for the Senator.
Mondale can combine complex
theory with practical
considerations and formulate
federal programs that work —
instead of overpromising and
overselling the probable impact of
federal initiatives.
Immensely Bright
The three of us agree Mondale
is an immensely bright man, a
secure man with ego needs under
proper control, a man deeply
committed to the American
dream of freedom and justice arid
peace, yet fully willing and able to
deal with problems at a practical
political level. Mondale has the
idealism of George McGovern
without his fuzziness.
He has the charm of Edward
Kennedy, yet is not bedeviled by
questionable past personal
incidents. And, in this era of
Watergate, Fritz Mondale is
unimpeachably honest and not for
sale to anybody. We are delighted
that he has recently begun to test
the waters of his possible
candidacy and we urge our fellow
voters to inform themselves of the
sterling qualifications of this wise
and able man.

Levin, and Micahel W. Kirst, are
professors in the School of
Education, and of anthropology,
economics, and business
administration, respectively.)
