Reply To Ogletree
Editor:
In considering Bill Evers'
article (Daily, Feb. 14), Charles
Ogletree (Daily, Feb. 19)
complains that it shows parallels
between a story about terrorism
caused by fictional black radicals
and the latest events concerning
the SLA.
It seems to me that the blame
for these parallels should not lie
with Evers, because the parallels
do exist. Ogletree should
complain to the SLA, not Evers,
for there being a similarity
between the SLA and the fictional
"Cobras."
Further, to assert that Evers'
analysis portrays "black people as
enemies of the people" is
ridiculous. How Ogletree could
have read this into the Evers
article is completely beyond me.
Ogletree crticizes Evers for
"innuendos and inferences," yet
in fact the most ridiculous
innuendo is made by Ogletree
himself when he paraphrases
Evers: "The author of the novel is
black, two of the suspects are
black, the voice on the tape is
supposedly that of a black, so in
essence the counterproductive
actions that have occurred portray
black people as the enemies of the
people."
Incredibly, Evers makes no
mention of any of this in his
whole article; yet this paraphrase
seems to be the heart of Ogletree's
rebuttal.
Finally, if Ogletree wished to

criticize Evers for implying certain
things, then he should have
pointed out where in the article
the implications were made,
because on rereading the Evers
article, I cannot find them there.

We are privileged this year to
have had the opportunity to
observe unobfuscated the
relationship between Stanford
University and its surrounding
community, which ultimately
reveals Stanford's role in
American society. Autumn
quarter, the Daily printed an
article which dealt with former
Stanford trustee (and, former
Deputy Secretary of Defense)
David Packard's address to a
group of possible corporate
donors to U.S. universities.
In this address Packard
exhorted these captains of
industry to be "judicious" in their
grants; that is to say, to give
money only to those universities
which take a definite stand against
radical faculty and which exercise
punitive actions against radical
activities of students. In addition,
Packard counseled these possible
donors to give grants exclusively
to science and engineering
departments, so as to receive a
profitable "return" on their
investments.
The Feb. 19 article "Stanford
TV Transmits Education" reveals

one of the fruits of these
investments. Stanford provides
(for an appropriate fee, of course)
high-level instruction in
engineering and other relevant
fields to 28 Bay Area industrial
firms.
Many of these firms make up
that amorphous composite known
a few years ago as the
'military-industrial complex.' The
Southern and Mid-Peninsula of
the Bay Area constitute one of
the most highly concentrated
regions of sophisticated
electronics research and
development in the U.S.A. Much
of this work has, in recent years,
been channelled into weapons
research for the Department of
Defense, and culminated in the
"electronic battlefield" of
Vietnam fame.
Stanford University prides
itself on its "liberal" notions of
education and its "progressive"
relationship to its community. It
is significant to note that this
liberal progressivism has applied
only to a very limited segment of
the community. (One look at
Stanford's land use policies shows
this to be evident.)
Stanford's ties with the
corporate defense industry, as
illuminated through its TV
program, are hardly accidental. It
is thus barely ironical that directly
below the article "Stanford TV
Transmits Education" was printed
a calendar of "Career Placement
Interviews"' to be conducted at
the Placement Center this month.
Among others, some of the

corporations listed were: Voice of
America, McDonnell-Douglas,
Laboratory at the Naval
Construction Battalion Center,
Teledyne Semiconductor (of
Mountain View), SHM Nuclear
Corporation (of Sunnyvale), Itel
Corp. (of Santa Clara), and the list

Reply To Ogletree
Editor:
In considering Bill Evers'
article (Daily, Feb. 14), Charles
Ogletree (Daily, Feb. 19)
complains that it shows parallels
between a story about terrorism
caused by fictional black radicals
and the latest events concerning
the SLA.
It seems to me that the blame
for these parallels should not lie
with Evers, because the parallels
do exist. Ogletree should
complain to the SLA, not Evers,
for there being a similarity
between the SLA and the fictional
"Cobras."
Further, to assert that Evers'
analysis portrays "black people as
enemies of the people" is
ridiculous. How Ogletree could
have read this into the Evers
article is completely beyond me.
Ogletree crticizes Evers for
"innuendos and inferences," yet
in fact the most ridiculous
innuendo is made by Ogletree
himself when he paraphrases
Evers: "The author of the novel is
black, two of the suspects are
black, the voice on the tape is
supposedly that of a black, so in
essence the counterproductive
actions that have occurred portray
black people as the enemies of the
people."
Incredibly, Evers makes no
mention of any of this in his
whole article; yet this paraphrase
seems to be the heart of Ogletree's
rebuttal.
Finally, if Ogletree wished to

criticize Evers for implying certain
things, then he should have
pointed out where in the article
the implications were made,
because on rereading the Evers
article, I cannot find them there.

We are privileged this year to
have had the opportunity to
observe unobfuscated the
relationship between Stanford
University and its surrounding
community, which ultimately
reveals Stanford's role in
American society. Autumn
quarter, the Daily printed an
article which dealt with former
Stanford trustee (and, former
Deputy Secretary of Defense)
David Packard's address to a
group of possible corporate
donors to U.S. universities.
In this address Packard
exhorted these captains of
industry to be "judicious" in their
grants; that is to say, to give
money only to those universities
which take a definite stand against
radical faculty and which exercise
punitive actions against radical
activities of students. In addition,
Packard counseled these possible
donors to give grants exclusively
to science and engineering
departments, so as to receive a
profitable "return" on their
investments.
The Feb. 19 article "Stanford
TV Transmits Education" reveals

one of the fruits of these
investments. Stanford provides
(for an appropriate fee, of course)
high-level instruction in
engineering and other relevant
fields to 28 Bay Area industrial
firms.
Many of these firms make up
that amorphous composite known
a few years ago as the
'military-industrial complex.' The
Southern and Mid-Peninsula of
the Bay Area constitute one of
the most highly concentrated
regions of sophisticated
electronics research and
development in the U.S.A. Much
of this work has, in recent years,
been channelled into weapons
research for the Department of
Defense, and culminated in the
"electronic battlefield" of
Vietnam fame.
Stanford University prides
itself on its "liberal" notions of
education and its "progressive"
relationship to its community. It
is significant to note that this
liberal progressivism has applied
only to a very limited segment of
the community. (One look at
Stanford's land use policies shows
this to be evident.)
Stanford's ties with the
corporate defense industry, as
illuminated through its TV
program, are hardly accidental. It
is thus barely ironical that directly
below the article "Stanford TV
Transmits Education" was printed
a calendar of "Career Placement
Interviews"' to be conducted at
the Placement Center this month.
Among others, some of the

corporations listed were: Voice of
America, McDonnell-Douglas,
Laboratory at the Naval
Construction Battalion Center,
Teledyne Semiconductor (of
Mountain View), SHM Nuclear
Corporation (of Sunnyvale), Itel
Corp. (of Santa Clara), and the list

Reply To Ogletree
Editor:
In considering Bill Evers'
article (Daily, Feb. 14), Charles
Ogletree (Daily, Feb. 19)
complains that it shows parallels
between a story about terrorism
caused by fictional black radicals
and the latest events concerning
the SLA.
It seems to me that the blame
for these parallels should not lie
with Evers, because the parallels
do exist. Ogletree should
complain to the SLA, not Evers,
for there being a similarity
between the SLA and the fictional
"Cobras."
Further, to assert that Evers'
analysis portrays "black people as
enemies of the people" is
ridiculous. How Ogletree could
have read this into the Evers
article is completely beyond me.
Ogletree crticizes Evers for
"innuendos and inferences," yet
in fact the most ridiculous
innuendo is made by Ogletree
himself when he paraphrases
Evers: "The author of the novel is
black, two of the suspects are
black, the voice on the tape is
supposedly that of a black, so in
essence the counterproductive
actions that have occurred portray
black people as the enemies of the
people."
Incredibly, Evers makes no
mention of any of this in his
whole article; yet this paraphrase
seems to be the heart of Ogletree's
rebuttal.
Finally, if Ogletree wished to

criticize Evers for implying certain
things, then he should have
pointed out where in the article
the implications were made,
because on rereading the Evers
article, I cannot find them there.

We are privileged this year to
have had the opportunity to
observe unobfuscated the
relationship between Stanford
University and its surrounding
community, which ultimately
reveals Stanford's role in
American society. Autumn
quarter, the Daily printed an
article which dealt with former
Stanford trustee (and, former
Deputy Secretary of Defense)
David Packard's address to a
group of possible corporate
donors to U.S. universities.
In this address Packard
exhorted these captains of
industry to be "judicious" in their
grants; that is to say, to give
money only to those universities
which take a definite stand against
radical faculty and which exercise
punitive actions against radical
activities of students. In addition,
Packard counseled these possible
donors to give grants exclusively
to science and engineering
departments, so as to receive a
profitable "return" on their
investments.
The Feb. 19 article "Stanford
TV Transmits Education" reveals

one of the fruits of these
investments. Stanford provides
(for an appropriate fee, of course)
high-level instruction in
engineering and other relevant
fields to 28 Bay Area industrial
firms.
Many of these firms make up
that amorphous composite known
a few years ago as the
'military-industrial complex.' The
Southern and Mid-Peninsula of
the Bay Area constitute one of
the most highly concentrated
regions of sophisticated
electronics research and
development in the U.S.A. Much
of this work has, in recent years,
been channelled into weapons
research for the Department of
Defense, and culminated in the
"electronic battlefield" of
Vietnam fame.
Stanford University prides
itself on its "liberal" notions of
education and its "progressive"
relationship to its community. It
is significant to note that this
liberal progressivism has applied
only to a very limited segment of
the community. (One look at
Stanford's land use policies shows
this to be evident.)
Stanford's ties with the
corporate defense industry, as
illuminated through its TV
program, are hardly accidental. It
is thus barely ironical that directly
below the article "Stanford TV
Transmits Education" was printed
a calendar of "Career Placement
Interviews"' to be conducted at
the Placement Center this month.
Among others, some of the

corporations listed were: Voice of
America, McDonnell-Douglas,
Laboratory at the Naval
Construction Battalion Center,
Teledyne Semiconductor (of
Mountain View), SHM Nuclear
Corporation (of Sunnyvale), Itel
Corp. (of Santa Clara), and the list
