# Jazz, Politics, Fire, Brimstone
## Glide Church 'A Free-form Celebration' 
### J.R. SULLIVAN 
SAN FRANCISCO - Cecil A.
Williams, the minister of
involvement of Glide Memorial
Church, delivers his message to an
audience of the poor, prostitutes,
blacks, chicanos, homosexuals,
the affluent (who are committed
to social change), the young and
hip. His message, given in two
celebrations on Sunday mornings,
criticizes the government, argues
for social change, demands
equality and self-determination
for disadvantaged and oppressed
minorities.
It sounds like the public
demonstrations of a political
movement spearheaded by an
organized group of radicals. But
Cecil Williams is a Methodist
minister, and the celebrations take
place in Glide Memorial Methodist
Church, on Taylor and Ellis in San

Francisco, across the street from
the Hilton Hotel.
A businessman staying in one
of the luxurious rooms in the
Hilton facing Taylor Street would
have the impression there was a
rock concert going on across the
street from 9 to 12:30 on Sunday
morning.
No Different
Inside Glide Memorial, the first
impression would not be any
different. In the place of the
apostles on the altar stage, a jazz
group calmly but insistently lays
out a strong beat and a rising
melodic line. A good portion of
the overflow crowd is dancing on
the stage and the steps leading up
to it.
A man clad in dingy, oversized
clothes, aged prematurely by
alcohol, wanders around the
periphery of the "dance floor"

and smiles a bit, clapping his
hands and stepping in time. A
young boy jumps around in his
seat, talking and shouting, singing
and laughing while his father pays
no attention.
The seats are full so the
latecomers sit down in the aisle or
around the altar stage. On the wall
above the stage, a light show
flashes pictures of Pat and
Richard Nixon, soldiers with fixed
bayonets, prisoners peering
through bars, clouds, stars and
psychedelia. The outfits and skin
colors of the congregation
complement the half-dozen
two-story stained glass windows
that let in the light from Ellis
Street.
Celebration Begins
The music stops. One of the
deacons formally begins the
celebration. "You're in a church,
yeah, but you're in Glide
Church," he says.
The celebration at Glide
Church transforms hymns into
folk and pop songs, doxologies
and credos into revolutionary
messages, and evangelical style
into consciousness-raising. The
first hour is filled with short
statements and long songs. It is
fun and every once in a while a bit

ludicrous. Rabbi Abraham
Feinberg (there are six different
priests and ministers associated
with Glide), at the end of a
revolutionary message calling for
minority self-determination,
quotes Ho Chi Minh as saying,
"Right on!"
Williams, who takes over the
last half-hour of the celebration, is
a little less rhetorical, trying to
focus the energy released by the
singing.
People, not Jesus, God or the
Devil, are Williams' main
concern. In a hellfire and
brimstone delivery, he marches
back and forth in the center aisle
berating people for being
detached.
"There is something that grips
the minds of men and women in
this world that keeps them
detached," he says."I believe so
much in people ... in the human
condition ... we become
independent [only] in context, in
the situation. Our lives can never
be detached!
"Watch out when people tell
you 'leave it up to Jesus.' What
they are saying is 'don't do
anything with your life;
something will happen.' " With an
ironic note in his voice, Williams

adds, "And it will."
Detached
"People get detached with
Jesus. The black people have been
waiting 100 years," he declares, as
the congregation responded with
hearty laughter.
Williams, wearing a full-length
dashiki, nevertheless has the
gospel touch. The celebration is
well-rehearsed spontaneity, very
much on the gut-level. And
everyone feels it.
The man in the church office
claims that disruptions and
heckling occur every once in a
while. "There have been threats to
the church and to Cecil's life,"
he says calmly, adding that the
free-form of the celebrations
makes some people feel a little
too free in expressing themselves.
Sometime ago, a young man
felt free enough to take off his
clothes during the sermon. Rev.
Williams handled the situation
about as coolly as any one could.
"What a beautiful body you
have," was all Williams said.

independent [only] in context, in
the situation. Our lives can never
be detached!
"Watch out when people tell
you 'leave it up to Jesus.' What
they are saying is 'don't do
anything with your life;
something will happen.' " With an
ironic note in his voice, Williams

adds, "And it will."
Detached
"People get detached with
Jesus. The black people have been
waiting 100 years," he declares, as
the congregation responded with
hearty laughter.
Williams, wearing a full-length
dashiki, nevertheless has the
gospel touch. The celebration is
well-rehearsed spontaneity, very
much on the gut-level. And
everyone feels it.
The man in the church office
claims that disruptions and
heckling occur every once in a
while. "There have been threats to
the church and to Cecil's life,"
he says calmly, adding that the
free-form of the celebrations
makes some people feel a little
too free in expressing themselves.
Sometime ago, a young man
felt free enough to take off his
clothes during the sermon. Rev.
Williams handled the situation
about as coolly as any one could.
"What a beautiful body you
have," was all Williams said.

CELEBRATION—CeciI A. Williams is the minister of involvement at
Glide Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco. Last year,
Williams led a Vesper Service in Memorial Church.
SAN FRANCISCO - Cecil A.
Williams, the minister of
involvement of Glide Memorial
Church, delivers his message to an
audience of the poor, prostitutes,
blacks, chicanos, homosexuals,
the affluent (who are committed
to social change), the young and
hip. His message, given in two
celebrations on Sunday mornings,
criticizes the government, argues
for social change, demands
equality and self-determination
for disadvantaged and oppressed
minorities.
It sounds like the public
demonstrations of a political
movement spearheaded by an
organized group of radicals. But
Cecil Williams is a Methodist
minister, and the celebrations take
place in Glide Memorial Methodist
Church, on Taylor and Ellis in San

Francisco, across the street from
the Hilton Hotel.
A businessman staying in one
of the luxurious rooms in the
Hilton facing Taylor Street would
have the impression there was a
rock concert going on across the
street from 9 to 12:30 on Sunday
morning.
No Different
Inside Glide Memorial, the first
impression would not be any
different. In the place of the
apostles on the altar stage, a jazz
group calmly but insistently lays
out a strong beat and a rising
melodic line. A good portion of
the overflow crowd is dancing on
the stage and the steps leading up
to it.
A man clad in dingy, oversized
clothes, aged prematurely by
alcohol, wanders around the
periphery of the "dance floor"

and smiles a bit, clapping his
hands and stepping in time. A
young boy jumps around in his
seat, talking and shouting, singing
and laughing while his father pays
no attention.
The seats are full so the
latecomers sit down in the aisle or
around the altar stage. On the wall
above the stage, a light show
flashes pictures of Pat and
Richard Nixon, soldiers with fixed
bayonets, prisoners peering
through bars, clouds, stars and
psychedelia. The outfits and skin
colors of the congregation
complement the half-dozen
two-story stained glass windows
that let in the light from Ellis
Street.
Celebration Begins
The music stops. One of the
deacons formally begins the
celebration. "You're in a church,
yeah, but you're in Glide
Church," he says.
The celebration at Glide
Church transforms hymns into
folk and pop songs, doxologies
and credos into revolutionary
messages, and evangelical style
into consciousness-raising. The
first hour is filled with short
statements and long songs. It is
fun and every once in a while a bit

ludicrous. Rabbi Abraham
Feinberg (there are six different
priests and ministers associated
with Glide), at the end of a
revolutionary message calling for
minority self-determination,
quotes Ho Chi Minh as saying,
"Right on!"
Williams, who takes over the
last half-hour of the celebration, is
a little less rhetorical, trying to
focus the energy released by the
singing.
People, not Jesus, God or the
Devil, are Williams' main
concern. In a hellfire and
brimstone delivery, he marches
back and forth in the center aisle
berating people for being
detached.
"There is something that grips
the minds of men and women in
this world that keeps them
detached," he says."I believe so
much in people ... in the human
condition ... we become
independent [only] in context, in
the situation. Our lives can never
be detached!
"Watch out when people tell
you 'leave it up to Jesus.' What

two-story stained glass windows
that let in the light from Ellis
Street.
Celebration Begins
The music stops. One of the
deacons formally begins the
celebration. "You're in a church,
yeah, but you're in Glide
Church," he says.
The celebration at Glide
Church transforms hymns into
folk and pop songs, doxologies
and credos into revolutionary
messages, and evangelical style
into consciousness-raising. The
first hour is filled with short
statements and long songs. It is
fun and every once in a while a bit

ludicrous. Rabbi Abraham
Feinberg (there are six different
priests and ministers associated
with Glide), at the end of a
revolutionary message calling for
minority self-determination,
quotes Ho Chi Minh as saying,
"Right on!"
Williams, who takes over the
last half-hour of the celebration, is
a little less rhetorical, trying to
focus the energy released by the
singing.
People, not Jesus, God or the
Devil, are Williams' main
concern. In a hellfire and
brimstone delivery, he marches
back and forth in the center aisle
berating people for being
detached.
"There is something that grips
the minds of men and women in
this world that keeps them
detached," he says."I believe so
much in people ... in the human
condition ... we become
independent [only] in context, in
the situation. Our lives can never
be detached!
"Watch out when people tell
you 'leave it up to Jesus.' What
they are saying is 'don't do
anything with your life;
something will happen.' " With an
ironic note in his voice, Williams

adds, "And it will."
Detached
"People get detached with
Jesus. The black people have been
waiting 100 years," he declares, as
the congregation responded with
hearty laughter.
Williams, wearing a full-length
dashiki, nevertheless has the
gospel touch. The celebration is
well-rehearsed spontaneity, very
much on the gut-level. And
everyone feels it.
The man in the church office
claims that disruptions and
heckling occur every once in a
while. "There have been threats to
the church and to Cecil's life,"
he says calmly, adding that the
free-form of the celebrations
makes some people feel a little
too free in expressing themselves.
Sometime ago, a young man
felt free enough to take off his
clothes during the sermon. Rev.
Williams handled the situation
about as coolly as any one could.
"What a beautiful body you
have," was all Williams said.

CELEBRATION—CeciI A. Williams is the minister of involvement at
Glide Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco. Last year,
Williams led a Vesper Service in Memorial Church.
SAN FRANCISCO - Cecil A.
Williams, the minister of
involvement of Glide Memorial
Church, delivers his message to an
audience of the poor, prostitutes,
blacks, chicanos, homosexuals,
the affluent (who are committed
to social change), the young and
hip. His message, given in two
celebrations on Sunday mornings,
criticizes the government, argues
for social change, demands
equality and self-determination
for disadvantaged and oppressed
minorities.
It sounds like the public
demonstrations of a political
movement spearheaded by an
organized group of radicals. But
Cecil Williams is a Methodist
minister, and the celebrations take
place in Glide Memorial Methodist
Church, on Taylor and Ellis in San

Francisco, across the street from
the Hilton Hotel.
A businessman staying in one
of the luxurious rooms in the
Hilton facing Taylor Street would
have the impression there was a
rock concert going on across the
street from 9 to 12:30 on Sunday
morning.
No Different
Inside Glide Memorial, the first
impression would not be any
different. In the place of the
apostles on the altar stage, a jazz
group calmly but insistently lays
out a strong beat and a rising
melodic line. A good portion of
the overflow crowd is dancing on
the stage and the steps leading up
to it.
A man clad in dingy, oversized
clothes, aged prematurely by
alcohol, wanders around the
periphery of the "dance floor"

and smiles a bit, clapping his
hands and stepping in time. A
young boy jumps around in his
seat, talking and shouting, singing
and laughing while his father pays
no attention.
The seats are full so the
latecomers sit down in the aisle or
around the altar stage. On the wall
above the stage, a light show
flashes pictures of Pat and
Richard Nixon, soldiers with fixed
bayonets, prisoners peering
through bars, clouds, stars and
psychedelia. The outfits and skin
colors of the congregation
complement the half-dozen
two-story stained glass windows
that let in the light from Ellis
Street.
