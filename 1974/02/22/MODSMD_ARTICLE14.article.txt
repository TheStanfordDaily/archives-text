# Recent Price Surges Forcing Buyer Action
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - With a
surge of more than 30 percent in
wholesale prices working its way
through consumer markets,
Americans are taking or
contemplating a variety of
defensive actions.
The increase, recorded in
December, will pressure its way
into the retail pricing of every
conceivable item in the next few
months.
Food prices might be especially
hard hit, because farm prices again
are on the rise, and the increases
are pretty much across the board
rather than for a few specific
items.
One way Americans seem to be
meeting this situation is by
purchasing less-expensive
products. That at least is one
conclusion that can be read from
the fact that food prices rose 22
percent in December but food
store dollar volume jumped only
13.4 percent.
Buying down is evident in
automobile sales, and not solely
because of the energy shortfall.
Small cars were picking up a
steadily larger share of the market
even before the full extent of the
oil predicament was clear.
Stocking up — you might call it
hoarding — always becomes the
strategy of some individuals when
shortages or higher prices are
forecast. Businessmen are inclined
to do the same.

There is little hard evidence as
yet that any substantial portion of
householders are buying canned
goods and other non-perishables in
expectation of higher prices, but
there is little to stop them from
doing so.
The problem is that, if used by
millions of householders on a
broad scale, this tactic becomes
counterproductive, forcing up
prices.
Some people react to raging
inflation by doing without
anything but the essentials.
Cutting their spending to the
bone, they pay off their
instalment loans and build up
their savings accounts.
When people are worried about
the declining value of paper
money they tend to seek
something more solid, and that
always includes gold, and
sometimes silver.
