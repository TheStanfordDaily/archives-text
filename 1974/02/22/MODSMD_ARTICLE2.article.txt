# Commission OKs CS Plan
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The Planning Commission of the
Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors voted unanimously
yesterday to recommend that the
Board pass the proposed city services
("cs") zone ordinance with the
amendment requested by Stanford.
If passed, the "cs" ordinance would
force all developers of land bordering
cities in Santa Clara County to request
annexation to those cities prior to
starting any new construction projects.
The University had requested that a
special amendment be added to the
ordinance to exclude Stanford.
University officials contended that the
ordinance was designed to halt
indiscriminate urban growth and did
not apply to Stanford, which provides
its own municipal services.
Stanford officials added that the
University has always conducted its
planning in a professional manner and
should not be included in the
ordinance at all.
Palo Alto had originally opposed
the University's effort to win
exemption from the amendment, but
later changed its position. Palo Alto
council members had argued that
certain lands bordering the city should
be included under the ordinance as the
University's planning would affect
Palo Alto.
The conflict threatened to disrupt
normal working relations
between the city and the University,
but a meeting early in January resulted
in a compromise: Palo Alto agreed to
support Stanford's request for
complete exemption from the
ordinance and Stanford promised to
inform the city of future University
building projects.
The support of Palo Alto in
Stanford's request for exemption was
a major factor in persuading the
Planning Commission to uphold
Stanford's contentions, according to
Robert Studerant, a staff advisor to
the Planning Commission.
Studerant emphasized that the

recommendation of the Planning
Commission does not assure that the
Board of Supervisors will approve the
measure. He predicted that the Board
will carefully review the
recommendation.
Stanford's amendment is the only
exception that was made to the city
services ordinance proposal made by
the Planning Commission, Studerant
noted.
Studerant explained that the seven
members of the Planning Commission
were convinced of the validity of
Stanford's claim that the University
provides its own municipal services in
an exemplary manner. Thus the
Commission decided that the
University does not constitute the
type of threat to the environment that
the ordinance was designed to prevent.
Michael Hudnall, University
counsel, said that he was very pleased
by the planning commission's decision.
Hudnall worked for several months to
persuade the commission to accept the
amendment. "Now, hopefully the
Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors will approve it," Hudnall
declared.
