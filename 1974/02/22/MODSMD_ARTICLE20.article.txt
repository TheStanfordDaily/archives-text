# Brazilian Carnival Features Capoiera Exhibition
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"Capoiera is badness," states
an old Brazilian saying, and
according to a Brazilian grad
student, that is a totally fair
description of his country's native
martial arts form.
Sergio Eston teaches capoiera
at Bechtel International Center
and will demonstrate the art at
the center's Brazilian Carnival
tomorrow night.
According to Eston, capoiera
originated among Brazilian slaves
as a method of concealing fights
from their masters. Capoiera is
done rhythmically to music so
that it appears to be a dance
rather than a deadly battle.
Continuous Movement
Cartwheels, kicks, handstands,
and punches are all performed in a
continuous cycle of movement.
Even when knocked down by an
opponent's blow, the capoierista
must keep moving fluidly.
Played in a small circle drawn
on the ground, Eston says of
capoiera "If you can play two
minutes in the circle, you're in
good shape."
Virtually unknown outside
Brazil, capoiera is one game in
which Eston says "everything is
fair." There is fierce rivalry
between the 10 capoiera
academies in Sao Paulo, and Eston

warns, "If you don't know the
other academy's people, you
better be good to go there and
play because they'll try to hurt
you."
Party Atmosphere
Although highly competitive,
capoiera in the academies is
played in a party atmosphere with
plenty of music and singing during
all-day tournaments.
It is traditional that
capoieristas wear white pants and
bare feet, along with a lucky
necklace. However, some masters
vary the tradition. One appears at
matches wearing white shoes, a
white hat, even a white
wristwatch — all of which except
the shoes he wears during actual
play.
It is also traditional that during
play a capoierista never touches
the ground enough to get the
white pants dirty.
Flag Colors
Rank among students in an
academy is shown by the rope
worn at the player's waist. The
ropes come in the colors in the
Brazilian flag; a rope combining
all the flag colors is awarded to
students qualified to teach.
Eston has played capoiera for
five years and had his own
academy in Brazil before coming
to Stanford. However, he points

out that not all capoiera is done in
academies. The sport is still a
popular fcrm of street fighting in
Bahia and other sections of Brazil.
All capoieristas must play the
instruments which accompany the
game: tambourine, conga, and
berimbau, or the "primative
master."
'Primitive Master'
The berimbau, a bowed stick
with a taut wire which is struck
with a much smaller stick, is
called the "primitive master"
because ali players must bow to it
before play begins. Should a
player want to leave the game, he
may return to the berimbau and
be excused from play.
Although the smoothness of
players' movements makes the
game appear rehearsed, Eston
explains that there is no rehearsal
in capoiera.
"All of the movements have a
reason. If you miss one, you get
hit."
Open Game
Punches in capoiera are never
done with a closed fist, but are
instead executed with the flat of
the foot. In an "open game" such
as the ones played in
demonstration or among friends,
the goal is not to actually hit the
opponent but only to
demonstrate that one could hit if

necessary.
In a closed or "block" game,
players actually fight until one is
injured and cannot continue.
Eston estimates that there are
no more than 25 capoiera masters
in Brazil. "You never play with
the master unless he asks you to,"
explains Eston. "The game stops
when the master wants it to
stop."
Only Nicknames
Masters as well as other
capoieristas are never known in
the sport by their real names, only
by nicknames. Eston's nickname
is Assanhaco, the name of a type
of bird.
Acordeon and Raposa are two
famous Brazilian masters who
Eston wants to bring to the
United States to demonstrate and
teach the sport. Because the sport
is so prevalent in Brazil, there is a
movement to make it the
country's national sport.
Although fewer in number,
there are women who play
capoiera. Eston states that most
men don't like to play against
women because while the man
tries to take it easy with the
woman, the woman will take
advantage of the situation and try
to defeat the man to prove her
superiority.
Perhaps this explains Eston's
own saying about capoiera: "If
you play with your mother, watch
out."
