# Ballet's 'Filling Station' Fuses Past, Modernity
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
Saturday evening's performance by the San Francisco Ballet
demonstrated that the most recent choreography is not always the
most modern.
The ballets presented ranged from Harp Concerto, created last year
by Michale Smuin, the company's young artistic director, to Filling
Station, a period piece originally choreographed in 1938 by Lew
Christensen.
Surprisingly, Christensen's Filling Station, proved to be the high
point of the evening. It is a narrative ballet about a filling station
attendant and his dealings with the unusual collection of Americans of
the 1930s who pass through his station. Spen today, the set, costumes
and characters fuse together in a piece that is reminiscent of
American Pop art.
Candid Humor
There is a candid humor to the personal stylization of each
character that makes the dance more than just another old ballet
revival. Rather than merely being dancers executing set movements,
these characters speak to the audience as distinct personalities, and
dance just happens to be their language.
In keeping with the simplicity and sincerity of his characters,
Christensen has choreographed movement that is equally personal and
distinct. The dancers shift effortlessly from a classic ballet vocabulary
into a dance vernacular of casual, almost athletic movements.
Anits Paciotti, as a tipsy rich girl in an evening gown was superb,
and her transitions from formal classicism to bawdy mime were
flawless. She faded effortlessly from an elegant arabesque into a
drunken rag doll heap at the foot of her partner; a forceful developpe
a la secondedissolved into a limp jab with a flexed foot, executed with
humor and an impeccable sense of timing.
Sincerity
There was a certain sincerity about what the dancers were doing
that set Filling Station apart from the more ornate and artificial
gestures of the evenings' other ballets.
Ballenchime's La Sonnambula (1946) based on Bellini's opera of
the same name, is a one act ballet that employs the dramatic device
of mingling the tragic and the ridiculous. It featured the week's guest
artist, Dagmar Kessler from the London Festival Ballet, as the ethereal
yet exacting sleepwalker who inadvertantly lures a poet to his death
against a backdrop of an elaborate society masque.
The plot is thin. It apparently exists merely as an excuse for the
ornate and dramatic sets, lighting, and costumes. Kessler is an
oxtremely controlled dancer, yet she has a certain dramatic presence
that made her portrayal of the sleepwalker compelling.
Dead Poet
Kessler's final gesture of carrying the dead poet offstage comes as a
shock, not so much because it is a physical feat, but because La
Sonnambula is such a delicate and celestial creature when she moves
that we hardly expect her capable of such a heroic task.
Like La Sonnambula, Smuin's Harp Concerto is a romantic ballet;
the trouble is that it doesn't really say anything.Throughout the piece
the dancers flit about the stage without succeeding in establishing any
rapport with the audience or each other.
The one exception is the slow pas de deux beautifully danced by
Diana Weber and Vane Vest. In this segment the music and the dance
blended harmoniously, if only briefly, before slipping back into the
tangle of sound and movement that marred the remainder of the
dance.
Ease, Confidence
The pas de deux from August Bournonville's Flower Festival,
1958, was at the last minute substituted for the Don Quixote pas de
deux. Despite this short notice Diana Weber and Peter Schaufuss, also
a guest artist, performed the classical pas de deux with an ease and
confidence that belied the lack of rehearsals.
The critic Edwin Denby once remarked that ballet is the one form
of theatre where nobody speaks a foolish word all evening, and the
San Francisco Ballet company at least lived up to this truism Saturday
night.
