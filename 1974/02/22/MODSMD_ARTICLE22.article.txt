# 'Last Summer' Keels Over
## 
### ROBERT WESTON 
After sitting through the
Company of Players' production
of Suddenly, Last Summer, I am
inclined to think that without the
likes of Marlon Brando, Eva Marie
Saint, or Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor, Tennessee
Williams will cease to interest even
those of us who enjoyed being
disturbed in the imperturbable
'50s by gratituous perversity
masquerading as spiritual
profundity. Perhaps a tee-shirted
or snake-skin jacketed Brando
could bring to life roles devoid of
humanity long enough to tease us
into thinking something was being
said — or at least long enough to
keep us in our seats — but
ordinary mortals such as those
who are probably doing their best
in the current professional
production at Lone Mountain
College do nothing but reveal the
pretentious fraudulance of such a
play as Suddenly, Last Summer.
Dead Drama
It is hard to see how the play
could work without the help of
Hollywood, for in spite of
Williams' reputation as "good
theater" (whatever the absurdities
of his pseudo-philosophy),
Suddenly, Last Summer is as dead

a piece of drama as one can
imagine. We are of course used to
the "verbal theater" of Beckett,
lonesco, and Albee in which most
of what happens is in the realm of
language and fantasy rather than
on the stage. But Williams isn't as
smart as Beckett, nor does he have
the linguistic skill of lonesco, and
Last Summer goes beyond even
Albee's Zoo Story, where all the
talk is still part of a subtle drama
occuring between the characters
before us.
If you can imagine a play
called Hamlet which begins some
months after the fifth act of
Shakespeare's play by that name
and in which Horatio tells the
story of the life and death of the
Prince of Denmark, you will have
some idea of the effect of
Suddenly, Last Summer.
But let us assume it is playable,
that the life and death of
Sebastian Venable is not only an
interesting (?) story, but is
important to the people who tell
it and to the people who listen to
it in the New Orleans garden of
his mother, Mrs. Violet Venable.
Unfortunately, with the
occasional exception of Phyllis
Courtney, who plays the
beleaguered Catherine Holly, the
players never rise above the level
of caricature. Wooden and
ludicrous, with Southern accents
as phoney as the fake Spanish
moss which drapes the cardboard
magnolias, line after line is
delivered without the least
suspicion that these speeches
mean anything to anybody. In
short, nothing happens on the
stage. One could get as much out
of the play by listening to a
recording.
Sordid Disclosures
Much of the blame must fall to
the director. A.J. Esta, the artistic
director for the Company, has
simply failed to get his actors to
do more than declaim. For
example, when the truth about
Sebastian Venable is finally being
delivered by Cousin Catherine
much against the wishes of Mrs.
Venable, Mr. Esta's idea of

dramatizing her reactions is to
have her tum her back to the
audience during the sordid
disclosures, and then, when all has
been said, to leap from her
wheelchair and try to flail
Catherine with her walking cane.
It is absurdly melodramatic, and
not a little comic, when
Catherine's brother, who until
now has been bent only on
keeping Catherine quiet so he can
smoothly inherit Cousin
Sebastian's money, turns to his
mother at the end of Catherine's
recital and cries "I'll quite school
and get a job!"
The play might have made a
sensational movie, but could most
easily have made a roaring farce.
The Company of Players has not
overcome the insufficiencies of
the script, and the most
entertaining thing about my visit
to the Lone Mountain theater was
the audience, which contained a
more varied and interesting (and
perhaps more bizzare) assortment
of human kind than anything on
the other side of the footlights.

The play might have made a
sensational movie, but could most
easily have made a roaring farce.
The Company of Players has not
overcome the insufficiencies of
the script, and the most
entertaining thing about my visit
to the Lone Mountain theater was
the audience, which contained a
more varied and interesting (and
perhaps more bizzare) assortment
of human kind than anything on
the other side of the footlights.
After sitting through the
Company of Players' production
of Suddenly, Last Summer, I am
inclined to think that without the
likes of Marlon Brando, Eva Marie
Saint, or Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor, Tennessee
Williams will cease to interest even
those of us who enjoyed being
disturbed in the imperturbable
'50s by gratituous perversity
masquerading as spiritual
profundity. Perhaps a tee-shirted
or snake-skin jacketed Brando
could bring to life roles devoid of
humanity long enough to tease us
into thinking something was being
said — or at least long enough to
keep us in our seats — but
ordinary mortals such as those
who are probably doing their best
in the current professional
production at Lone Mountain
College do nothing but reveal the
pretentious fraudulance of such a
play as Suddenly, Last Summer.
Dead Drama
It is hard to see how the play
could work without the help of
Hollywood, for in spite of
Williams' reputation as "good
theater" (whatever the absurdities
of his pseudo-philosophy),
Suddenly, Last Summer is as dead

a piece of drama as one can
imagine. We are of course used to
the "verbal theater" of Beckett,
lonesco, and Albee in which most
of what happens is in the realm of
language and fantasy rather than
on the stage. But Williams isn't as
smart as Beckett, nor does he have
the linguistic skill of lonesco, and
Last Summer goes beyond even
Albee's Zoo Story, where all the
talk is still part of a subtle drama
occuring between the characters
before us.
If you can imagine a play
called Hamlet which begins some
months after the fifth act of
Shakespeare's play by that name
and in which Horatio tells the
story of the life and death of the
Prince of Denmark, you will have
some idea of the effect of
Suddenly, Last Summer.
But let us assume it is playable,
that the life and death of
Sebastian Venable is not only an
interesting (?) story, but is
important to the people who tell
it and to the people who listen to
it in the New Orleans garden of
his mother, Mrs. Violet Venable.
Unfortunately, with the
occasional exception of Phyllis
Courtney, who plays the
beleaguered Catherine Holly, the
players never rise above the level
of caricature. Wooden and
ludicrous, with Southern accents
as phoney as the fake Spanish
moss which drapes the cardboard
magnolias, line after line is
delivered without the least
suspicion that these speeches
mean anything to anybody. In
short, nothing happens on the
stage. One could get as much out
of the play by listening to a
recording.
Sordid Disclosures
Much of the blame must fall to
the director. A.J. Esta, the artistic
director for the Company, has
simply failed to get his actors to
do more than declaim. For
example, when the truth about
Sebastian Venable is finally being
delivered by Cousin Catherine
much against the wishes of Mrs.
Venable, Mr. Esta's idea of

dramatizing her reactions is to
have her tum her back to the
audience during the sordid
disclosures, and then, when all has
been said, to leap from her
wheelchair and try to flail
Catherine with her walking cane.
It is absurdly melodramatic, and
not a little comic, when
Catherine's brother, who until
now has been bent only on
keeping Catherine quiet so he can
smoothly inherit Cousin
Sebastian's money, turns to his
mother at the end of Catherine's
recital and cries "I'll quite school
and get a job!"
