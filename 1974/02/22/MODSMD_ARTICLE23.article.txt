# Big John Plays Cop At Last
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
In McQ John Wayne has left
his horse behind for the first time
since 1968 (The Green Berets),
and the results are disastrous. He
trades his horse for a souped-up
Pontiac, his western garb for a
plainclothes policeman's suit and
his trusty six-shooter for a fancy,
illicit machine pistol.
Since the bulk of movies being
made presently either are about
cops and/or robbers, black
action/exploitation, or martial
arts (or any combination of the
above), it's only logical that Big
John would finally have to play a
cop.
And what a cop McQ is —
definitely not any establishment
lackey. No, in an effort to get to
the bottom of a big, smelly mess
in the Seattle police department,
McQ resorts to breaking and
entering, assault and battery,
carrying an unlicensed,
unregistered weapon, stealing
heroin from a junkie, getting laid
by an aging prostitute, hot-wiring
a police car and paying money for
information.
The trouble with McQ as a
movie is that Big John's activities
are about all that's going on.
Without his cowboy
accouterments, Wayne just can't
carry a film that's bogged down

by clipped, banal dialogue and
direction that moves the plot
along with the statliness of a
funeral procession. From John
Sturges, the director that gave
movie fans The Magnificent Seven
and The Great Escape, much more
finesse should have been in
evidence.
Instead, there's a dash of
Magnum Force, a pinch of Serpico
and a handful of The Seven-Ups,
combined with muddled
references to some pre and post
French Connection difficulties of
the New York City police.
There are the obligatory car
chase scenes, with Wayne holding
on to the steering wheel for dear
life, looking like he'd rather be
driving the War Wagon. There's
also the standard tough-cop
punches-out-slimy-mobster in the
john, banter-with-black-partner,
and dressing-down-by-police
captain who wants McQ to be
"part of the team."
But McQ's way is highly
individualistic; that is, like the
protagonists in dozens of other
police movies. Al&ough Wayne
tries to adopt bits of business
other actors have used
successfully — the Harry Callahan
stance for firing pistols at
fugitives, or the frenzied,
horn-honking tactics of Popeye

Doyle in a car chase — the result is
that Duke looks mannered and
foolish and not very interesting or
interested.
The rest of the rather
distinguished cast (Eddie Albert,
A 1 Lettieri and David Huddleston
among others) muddle through
their parts, adrift in Wayne's
wake.
However, the Duke does have a
chance to sum up the film in the
following exchange with Diana
Muldaur:
She — "Why does anybody
want to be a cop?"
Wayne — "How about a
drink?"
