# New Pool Dedication Tomorrow
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
Although it has been in
operation since November, the
new swimming-handball-squash
complex will finally be dedicated
tomorrow afternoon in a colorful
ceremony preceding the
Stanford-California swim meet.
The $2.2 million structure will be
officially named the Dorothy and
Sydney deGuerre Pools and
Courts.
Beginning at 1 p.m., the
dedication will feature remarks
from Stanford President Richard
Lyman, Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz and University Trustee W.
Parmer Fuller 111. Also featured
are two exhibitions of
synchronized swimming. The first
routine will be performed by the
Santa Clara Aquamaids, the
world's number-one amateur
synchronized swimming team.
The second act features
Stanford's Heidi O'Rourke in a
solo.
Act three won't be quite as
artistic. California confronts
Stanford's swimmers in the final
dual meet of the season. In this
show, they just swim up and
down the pool.
It has been said lately that what
Berkeley does to Stanford in
water p >!o, Stanford does to
Berkeley in swimming. If such is
the case, the Bears should prepare
for a trouncing. Berkeley, coached
by Pete Cutino, won the NCAA
water polo championship last fall
but should be no match for
Stanford's powerful swimmers.
Cal has some good national
swimmers but compared to the
sixth-ranked Cards ... well,
there's no comparison.
This will be the bst
Stanford-Cal swim meet i'or
Cutino. The highly respected
Cutino is in his final year as head
swim coach, deciding to
concentrate on water polo.
Stanford's swimmers are now in
the final stages of preparation for
the Pacific Eight and NCAA
championships. While tomorrow's
meet has little bearing on those
future events, it will still be
important for several Cardinal
swimmers.
The JV's will be vying for spots
on the varsity squad that travels
to Seattle for the Pac-8
championships.
One race Saturday, the 200
freestyle, should be most
interesting. The middle distance
swimmers have been working hard
most of the year, but lately have
begun to concentrate on speed.
With positions on the 800
freestyle relay at the NCAA's still
up for grabs, tomorrow's race
could be a dogfight.
Junior College transfer Craig
Van Zandt is one of Jim
Gaughran's top hopefuls. Ron
Longinotti, a member of last
year's Ail-American relay said that
he's "gunning for the 200" again
this year.

Swimming Notes: The Cards,
6-1 in dual meet competition, are
fresh from an outstanding win
over UCLA .... Terry Sutton,
who won the 1000 and placed
third in the 500 against the
Bruins, missed the Stanford
record by one tenth of a second in
the 1000 .

Swimming Notes: The Cards,
6-1 in dual meet competition, are
fresh from an outstanding win
over UCLA .... Terry Sutton,
who won the 1000 and placed
third in the 500 against the
Bruins, missed the Stanford
record by one tenth of a second in
the 1000 .
Although it has been in
operation since November, the
new swimming-handball-squash
complex will finally be dedicated
tomorrow afternoon in a colorful
ceremony preceding the
Stanford-California swim meet.
The $2.2 million structure will be
officially named the Dorothy and
Sydney deGuerre Pools and
Courts.
Beginning at 1 p.m., the
dedication will feature remarks
from Stanford President Richard
Lyman, Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz and University Trustee W.
Parmer Fuller 111. Also featured
are two exhibitions of
synchronized swimming. The first
routine will be performed by the
Santa Clara Aquamaids, the
world's number-one amateur
synchronized swimming team.
The second act features
Stanford's Heidi O'Rourke in a
solo.
Act three won't be quite as
artistic. California confronts
Stanford's swimmers in the final
dual meet of the season. In this
show, they just swim up and
down the pool.
It has been said lately that what
Berkeley does to Stanford in
water p >!o, Stanford does to
Berkeley in swimming. If such is
the case, the Bears should prepare
for a trouncing. Berkeley, coached
by Pete Cutino, won the NCAA
water polo championship last fall
but should be no match for
Stanford's powerful swimmers.
Cal has some good national
swimmers but compared to the
sixth-ranked Cards ... well,
there's no comparison.
This will be the bst
Stanford-Cal swim meet i'or
Cutino. The highly respected
Cutino is in his final year as head
swim coach, deciding to
concentrate on water polo.
Stanford's swimmers are now in
the final stages of preparation for
the Pacific Eight and NCAA
championships. While tomorrow's
meet has little bearing on those
future events, it will still be
important for several Cardinal
swimmers.
The JV's will be vying for spots
on the varsity squad that travels
to Seattle for the Pac-8
championships.
One race Saturday, the 200
freestyle, should be most
interesting. The middle distance
swimmers have been working hard
most of the year, but lately have
begun to concentrate on speed.
With positions on the 800
freestyle relay at the NCAA's still
up for grabs, tomorrow's race
could be a dogfight.
