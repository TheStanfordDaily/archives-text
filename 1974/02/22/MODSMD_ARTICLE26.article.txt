# IM Roundup
## Plumbers Earn Top Seed 
### PETE BHATIA 
The intramural basketball championships begin
Monday with the Plumbers seeded number-one.
Led by their big center Dan Broderick, the
Plumbers went 4-0 on the regular season, beating
such notable teams as El Toro and last year's
champions, KA.
Seeded number two are the Phi Delts. They also
completed the regular season undefeated and
feature a quick, aggressive style of play. Among
their top players are Kurt Peterson and football
wide receiver Bill Singler.
In the third spot are last year's basketball
runnerups, the Theta Delts. They rely largely on a
devastating outside shooting touch and the inside
jump .g ability of front-liners Jim lams and Terry
Winsor.
The fourth seed is Machismo. Like the top three,
they came through the regualr season with a perfect
4-0 mark. Machismo depends largely on its
towering front line, led by Kevin Enright.
Rounding out theseeds are Wildmen (sth), Macs
(6th), KA (7th) and the Dekes (Bth).
The first round matchups feature the Plumbers
against SAE, Larkin vs. the Dekes, Wildmen against
the winner of Biz II A and the Culos,
Slaughterhause 5 versus Machismo, Theta Delts
against Biz I A 1 and the Macs against the winner of
Madera and the Mighty Mites. KA meets the Zetes
and Alondra-Cardenal faces the Phi Delts. These
pairings maychange due to makeup games still to be
played this weekend.
In the "B" division, the tentative seedings show
Rinc '69, last year's runnerups, seeded in the top
spot. Rinc averaged 98 points per game in the
regular season posting, a 4-0 record. The running
Rinc offense is led by Charlie "Mr. Assist" Hoyt
and Don Hunt.

The other "B" seeds are Dada II (2nd), Whitman
(3rd), Bohansens (4th), Pfft (sth), Team Trancos I
(6th), Phi Delt B2 (7th), Econometrica (Bth) and
Stickey Fingers (9th).
The "B" playoffs also begin Monday night and
due to the large number of teams which have
qualified for the tournament (65), teams will play
every night (Monday-Thursday) until the tourney is
completed.
Much to everybody's chagrin, Gavilan '72 did
not qualify for the final championship tourney.
