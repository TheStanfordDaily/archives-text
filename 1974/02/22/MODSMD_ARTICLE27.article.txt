# Frosh Star Looks Toward Pac-8's
## Yancey Nears Wrestling Goals 
### STEVE SOULE 
At the beginning of this year, Stanford
wrestling coach Joe De Meo said that the
1973-74 team could be the best Stanford
wrestling team ever. Well, it hasn't been
bad, but it could have been much better if
it wasn't for a string of freak accidents
which have sidelined six of 10 starters.
One of the few bright spots has been the
performance of freshman Mark Yancey.
Yancey sports a fine 14-4 record, and
according to De Meo, "has been our best
wrestler this year."
The quietly confident Yancey does not
seem surprised by his success. "At the start
of the year I set my goals on just making
varsity and hopefully placing in the Pacific
Eight meet," he said. "Joe told me I didn't
know how tough that would be, but now it
looks like I could do it."
An outstanding high school wrestler at
Antelope Valley High in Lancaster, Yancey
was recruited by California and Colorado
School of Mines, but chose Stanford
"mainly because of academics."
Serious Student
A serious student whose major is
chemical engineering, Yancey admits that
wrestling takes up a lot of time. "Practice
takes up three hours a day. I study for one
to two hours before practice and about
three hours after practice. But it's worth it.
In high school 1 got a lot of prestige from
wrestling, but here it's mainly personal
satisfaction. I just enjoy wrestling — it's
part of my life."
Although competition is on a "much
higher level" here, Yancey didn't find the
transition from high school to college
wrestling too difficult. "At first I thought
everyone was a lot better than me, but I
was out of shape from not working out in
the summer. As the season went on, I

found that I could stay with anybody near
my weight," he explains.
One difference he did notice was in the
coaching. "I thought my fundamentals
were good, but I discovered they weren't
when I got here. I had to just about start
all over." He likes De Meo, saying, "Joe's a
really good coach — he'll do anything to
help the team."
'Tremendous Future'
In return. Do Meo is characteristically

ebullient in his praise of Yancey. "He's got
a tremendous future. He's very coachable,
tries hard to learn and devotes a lot of time
to wrestling. He does all the things that
make people champions. He's got great
speed and strength, and if he keeps the
mental attitude he has now and keeps
working hard, I think he could be an
All-American in a couple years."
But like all top athletes, Yancey isn't
looking too far into the future. Right now

he's pointing towards next week's Pac-8
meet at Berkeley. He's been wrestling at
both 134 and 142 this year, and it hasn't
yet been decided where he'll go in the
Pac-8 meet.
Yancey says, "I'd rather go at 142. I've
done as well there as at 134, and I don't
like to cut that much weight. I can do it,
but it makes it hard to study when I lose
that much. I don't know too much about
the competition at each weight, so I'm
gonna let Joe decide. He knows a lot more
about it then I do."
NCAA Hopes
De Meo will probably put him at 142, as
"134 is one of the toughest weights in the
conference." All of which is fine with
Yancey, who feels he has a good chance to
place in the top four and go on to the
NCAA's in Ames, lowa.
Yancey is realistically skeptical about
Stanford's chances as a team in the Pac-8
meet. He feels that, "a couple guys have
chances to place, but as a team we won't
do much. We've just had too many injuries.
But next year, we could really be strong."
Both Yancey and De Meo have to smile
when thinking about the future. De Meo
has virtually his entire team back next
year, including injured All-American Chris
Horpel. And Yancey is going to work hard
this summer to insure a rosy future. "I'm
going to stay in shape this summer and
wrestle in a lot of freestyle tournaments. I
just love wrestling and want to keep
competing as long as possible, even after
I'm out of college."
Yancey and his teammates will be in
action tonight at Berkeley against the
California Bears, and tomorrow night in
Maples at 6 p.m. against Fresno State in
their final tuneup for the Pac-8 meet.

the competition at each weight, so I'm
gonna let Joe decide. He knows a lot more
about it then I do."
NCAA Hopes
De Meo will probably put him at 142, as
"134 is one of the toughest weights in the
conference." All of which is fine with
Yancey, who feels he has a good chance to
place in the top four and go on to the
NCAA's in Ames, lowa.
Yancey is realistically skeptical about
Stanford's chances as a team in the Pac-8
meet. He feels that, "a couple guys have
chances to place, but as a team we won't
do much. We've just had too many injuries.
But next year, we could really be strong."
Both Yancey and De Meo have to smile
when thinking about the future. De Meo
has virtually his entire team back next
year, including injured All-American Chris
Horpel. And Yancey is going to work hard
this summer to insure a rosy future. "I'm
going to stay in shape this summer and
wrestle in a lot of freestyle tournaments. I
just love wrestling and want to keep
competing as long as possible, even after
I'm out of college."
Yancey and his teammates will be in
action tonight at Berkeley against the
California Bears, and tomorrow night in
Maples at 6 p.m. against Fresno State in
their final tuneup for the Pac-8 meet.

MARK YANCEY SCORES A TAKEDOWN
At the beginning of this year, Stanford
wrestling coach Joe De Meo said that the
1973-74 team could be the best Stanford
wrestling team ever. Well, it hasn't been
bad, but it could have been much better if
it wasn't for a string of freak accidents
which have sidelined six of 10 starters.
One of the few bright spots has been the
performance of freshman Mark Yancey.
Yancey sports a fine 14-4 record, and
according to De Meo, "has been our best
wrestler this year."
The quietly confident Yancey does not
seem surprised by his success. "At the start
of the year I set my goals on just making
varsity and hopefully placing in the Pacific
Eight meet," he said. "Joe told me I didn't
know how tough that would be, but now it
looks like I could do it."
An outstanding high school wrestler at
Antelope Valley High in Lancaster, Yancey
was recruited by California and Colorado
School of Mines, but chose Stanford
"mainly because of academics."
Serious Student
A serious student whose major is
chemical engineering, Yancey admits that
wrestling takes up a lot of time. "Practice
takes up three hours a day. I study for one
to two hours before practice and about
three hours after practice. But it's worth it.
In high school 1 got a lot of prestige from
wrestling, but here it's mainly personal
satisfaction. I just enjoy wrestling — it's
part of my life."
Although competition is on a "much
higher level" here, Yancey didn't find the
transition from high school to college
wrestling too difficult. "At first I thought
everyone was a lot better than me, but I
was out of shape from not working out in
the summer. As the season went on, I

found that I could stay with anybody near
my weight," he explains.
One difference he did notice was in the
coaching. "I thought my fundamentals
were good, but I discovered they weren't
when I got here. I had to just about start
all over." He likes De Meo, saying, "Joe's a
really good coach — he'll do anything to
help the team."
'Tremendous Future'
In return. Do Meo is characteristically

ebullient in his praise of Yancey. "He's got
a tremendous future. He's very coachable,
tries hard to learn and devotes a lot of time
to wrestling. He does all the things that
make people champions. He's got great
speed and strength, and if he keeps the
mental attitude he has now and keeps
working hard, I think he could be an
All-American in a couple years."
But like all top athletes, Yancey isn't
looking too far into the future. Right now

he's pointing towards next week's Pac-8
meet at Berkeley. He's been wrestling at
both 134 and 142 this year, and it hasn't
yet been decided where he'll go in the
Pac-8 meet.
Yancey says, "I'd rather go at 142. I've
done as well there as at 134, and I don't
like to cut that much weight. I can do it,
but it makes it hard to study when I lose
that much. I don't know too much about
the competition at each weight, so I'm
gonna let Joe decide. He knows a lot more
about it then I do."

One difference he did notice was in the
coaching. "I thought my fundamentals
were good, but I discovered they weren't
when I got here. I had to just about start
all over." He likes De Meo, saying, "Joe's a
really good coach — he'll do anything to
help the team."
'Tremendous Future'
In return. Do Meo is characteristically

ebullient in his praise of Yancey. "He's got
a tremendous future. He's very coachable,
tries hard to learn and devotes a lot of time
to wrestling. He does all the things that
make people champions. He's got great
speed and strength, and if he keeps the
mental attitude he has now and keeps
working hard, I think he could be an
All-American in a couple years."
But like all top athletes, Yancey isn't
looking too far into the future. Right now

he's pointing towards next week's Pac-8
meet at Berkeley. He's been wrestling at
both 134 and 142 this year, and it hasn't
yet been decided where he'll go in the
Pac-8 meet.
Yancey says, "I'd rather go at 142. I've
done as well there as at 134, and I don't
like to cut that much weight. I can do it,
but it makes it hard to study when I lose
that much. I don't know too much about
the competition at each weight, so I'm
gonna let Joe decide. He knows a lot more
about it then I do."
NCAA Hopes
De Meo will probably put him at 142, as
"134 is one of the toughest weights in the
conference." All of which is fine with
Yancey, who feels he has a good chance to
place in the top four and go on to the
NCAA's in Ames, lowa.
Yancey is realistically skeptical about
Stanford's chances as a team in the Pac-8
meet. He feels that, "a couple guys have
chances to place, but as a team we won't
do much. We've just had too many injuries.
But next year, we could really be strong."
Both Yancey and De Meo have to smile
when thinking about the future. De Meo
has virtually his entire team back next
year, including injured All-American Chris
Horpel. And Yancey is going to work hard
this summer to insure a rosy future. "I'm
going to stay in shape this summer and
wrestle in a lot of freestyle tournaments. I
just love wrestling and want to keep
competing as long as possible, even after
I'm out of college."
Yancey and his teammates will be in
action tonight at Berkeley against the
California Bears, and tomorrow night in
Maples at 6 p.m. against Fresno State in
their final tuneup for the Pac-8 meet.

MARK YANCEY SCORES A TAKEDOWN
At the beginning of this year, Stanford
wrestling coach Joe De Meo said that the
1973-74 team could be the best Stanford
wrestling team ever. Well, it hasn't been
bad, but it could have been much better if
it wasn't for a string of freak accidents
which have sidelined six of 10 starters.
One of the few bright spots has been the
performance of freshman Mark Yancey.
Yancey sports a fine 14-4 record, and
according to De Meo, "has been our best
wrestler this year."
The quietly confident Yancey does not
seem surprised by his success. "At the start
of the year I set my goals on just making
varsity and hopefully placing in the Pacific
Eight meet," he said. "Joe told me I didn't
know how tough that would be, but now it
looks like I could do it."
An outstanding high school wrestler at
Antelope Valley High in Lancaster, Yancey
was recruited by California and Colorado
School of Mines, but chose Stanford
"mainly because of academics."
Serious Student
A serious student whose major is
chemical engineering, Yancey admits that
wrestling takes up a lot of time. "Practice
takes up three hours a day. I study for one
to two hours before practice and about
three hours after practice. But it's worth it.
In high school 1 got a lot of prestige from
wrestling, but here it's mainly personal
satisfaction. I just enjoy wrestling — it's
part of my life."
Although competition is on a "much
higher level" here, Yancey didn't find the
transition from high school to college
wrestling too difficult. "At first I thought
everyone was a lot better than me, but I
was out of shape from not working out in
the summer. As the season went on, I

found that I could stay with anybody near
my weight," he explains.
One difference he did notice was in the
coaching. "I thought my fundamentals
were good, but I discovered they weren't
when I got here. I had to just about start
all over." He likes De Meo, saying, "Joe's a
