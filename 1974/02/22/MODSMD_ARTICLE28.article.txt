# Stanford Dominates NorCals
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Two things usually happen at the
Northern California Intercollegiate Tennis
tournament, and they're happening again this
year.
First, Stanford's going to win.
Second, rain is making a mess of the
tournament schedule.
Wednesday's first and second round play
here left only eight singles players alive. Six
of them are from Stanford, as no Cardinal
lost to a player from any of the other schools
entered; Cal, San Francisco State and San
Jose State.
In doubles, the Cards qualified all three of
their teams into the quarterfinal round,
originally scheduled for yesterday but
completely rained out.
Barring more rain, the tournament will be
completed tomorrow, as originally scheduled,
but several players will likely be exhausted
by that time.
Today's schedule calls for the singles
quarterfinals at one p.m., the singles
semifinals at three, and the doubles
quarterfinals at five.
Tomorrow the varsity courts will be the
scene of the singles finals at one, and the
doubles semis and finals at three and five.
And it's possible that Chip Fisher and
either John Whitlinger or Chico Hagey will
have to play three times each day.

Today's singles quarters shape up like this:
In the upper bracket Whitlinger, the top
seed, plays Cal's Doug King while two
Cardinals, Nick Saviano and Hagey, also face

In the lower bracket, it's Fisher vs. Paul
Sidone and Mark Mitchell against Andy
Moffat. Moffat, from San Jose State, is the
only non-Cardinal in this bunch.
In doubles, Cal's first-seeded team of
Steve Bartlett-Steve Prouix plays Stanford's
Jake Warde and Tim Noonan.
Whitlinger-Craig Johnson face the Bears'
Doug King-Peter Campbell. The other
Stanford team, Hagey-Fisher, plays against
Terry Rodgers and Joe Meyers of SJS.
Team standings at the end of the first day
of play show Stanford leading with 11
points, SJS and Cal in a tight battle for
second with seven and six points,
respectively, and SF State completely
zilched.
Surprisingly, the only two Stanford
players who had any trouble at all on the
first day of play were Whitlinger and
Mitchell, the first and third seeds. Whitlinger
was the only Cardinal to lose a set, beating
Cal's Chris Sylvan 7-5, 0-6, 6-3, while
Mitchell had to pull out two tiebreakers in
beating Bartlett 7-6, 7-6.
The other two seeded players didn't do
much, either. Fourth-seeded Campbell lost to
Saviano 6-4, 6-3, and second-seeded Trey
Waltke of Cal didn't even show up — he
decided to spend the week at a junior
tournament in Salisbury, Md.

first day of play were Whitlinger and
Mitchell, the first and third seeds. Whitlinger
was the only Cardinal to lose a set, beating
Cal's Chris Sylvan 7-5, 0-6, 6-3, while
Mitchell had to pull out two tiebreakers in
beating Bartlett 7-6, 7-6.
The other two seeded players didn't do
much, either. Fourth-seeded Campbell lost to
Saviano 6-4, 6-3, and second-seeded Trey
Waltke of Cal didn't even show up — he
decided to spend the week at a junior
tournament in Salisbury, Md.
Two things usually happen at the
Northern California Intercollegiate Tennis
tournament, and they're happening again this
year.
First, Stanford's going to win.
Second, rain is making a mess of the
tournament schedule.
Wednesday's first and second round play
here left only eight singles players alive. Six
of them are from Stanford, as no Cardinal
lost to a player from any of the other schools
entered; Cal, San Francisco State and San
Jose State.
In doubles, the Cards qualified all three of
their teams into the quarterfinal round,
originally scheduled for yesterday but
completely rained out.
Barring more rain, the tournament will be
completed tomorrow, as originally scheduled,
but several players will likely be exhausted
by that time.
Today's schedule calls for the singles
quarterfinals at one p.m., the singles
semifinals at three, and the doubles
quarterfinals at five.
Tomorrow the varsity courts will be the
scene of the singles finals at one, and the
doubles semis and finals at three and five.
And it's possible that Chip Fisher and
either John Whitlinger or Chico Hagey will
have to play three times each day.

Today's singles quarters shape up like this:
In the upper bracket Whitlinger, the top
seed, plays Cal's Doug King while two
Cardinals, Nick Saviano and Hagey, also face

In the lower bracket, it's Fisher vs. Paul
Sidone and Mark Mitchell against Andy
Moffat. Moffat, from San Jose State, is the
only non-Cardinal in this bunch.
In doubles, Cal's first-seeded team of
Steve Bartlett-Steve Prouix plays Stanford's
Jake Warde and Tim Noonan.
Whitlinger-Craig Johnson face the Bears'
Doug King-Peter Campbell. The other
Stanford team, Hagey-Fisher, plays against
Terry Rodgers and Joe Meyers of SJS.
Team standings at the end of the first day
of play show Stanford leading with 11
points, SJS and Cal in a tight battle for
second with seven and six points,
respectively, and SF State completely
zilched.
Surprisingly, the only two Stanford
players who had any trouble at all on the
first day of play were Whitlinger and
Mitchell, the first and third seeds. Whitlinger
was the only Cardinal to lose a set, beating
Cal's Chris Sylvan 7-5, 0-6, 6-3, while
