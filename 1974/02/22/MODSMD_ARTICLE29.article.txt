# Stanford Players Triumph
## 
### 
It's been a great week for Stanford tennis
players.
Jim Delaney, a junior, has reached the
semifinals of the National Indoor
Championships in Salisbury, Md. Playing
what is probably the best tennis of his career,
Delaney topped Colombia's top player, Ivan
Molina, 7-4, 6-1 on Wednesday and French
star Pierre Barthes 4-6, 7-6, 6-3 yesterday.
Barthes had eliminated top-seeded Hie
Nastase of Rumania the day before, while
Delaney's previous wins included one over
France's fourth-ranked player, Georges
Govan.
Senior Sandy Mayer also remains alive in
the tournament. He'll try to join Delaney in
Saturday's semis when he meets Yugoslavia's
Nikki Pilic today.
And ex-Stanford star Roscoe Tanner has
reached the semis of the $48,000 World
Championship Tennis tourney in London,
beating favored Rod Laver of Australia
yesterday by a 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 score.
