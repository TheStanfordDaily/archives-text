# Kidnapers Make New Demands: $4 Million More In Free Food
## 
### 
HILLSBOROUGH (AP) - The
kidnapers of Patricia Hearst accused
her father of "throwing a few crumbs
to the people" yesterday and
demanded he add another $4 million
within 24 hours to a $2 million food
giveaway program.
The administrator of the food plan
said later he was confident that
donations of food will top the total $6
million demand.
"There is no question that we
would be far in excess of that, no
question at all," said A. Ludlow
Kramer, a Washington State official.
The Symbionese Liberation Army
said the funds should be made
available within 24 hours and that the
entire $6 million worth of food should
be available within one week. Any
family seeking the groceries should get
$70 worth each, declared "Cinque,"
who calls himself general field marshal
of the SLA.
While Kramer said he expected to
have that much food available, he
declined to characterize it as a
response to the new SLA demands,
received in a tape-recorded message
yesterday.
Food Program Decision
"This is in no way implying that
Mr. Hearst will or will not meet the

demands. What I am saying is that the
decision has been made to carry out
the food bank program that he
authorized," he said.
Kramer, secretary of state of
Washington State, said distribution
would begin at four points today at
noon — one each in Oakland, San
Francisco, Richmond and East Palo
Alto.
Each family can take what it needs,
no questions asked, Kramer said.
Other distribution centers
demanded by the SLA will be opened
over the weekend, Kramer said.
Still Alive
In another development, the FBI
agent in charge of the case said he is
convinced by the latest tape that
Patricia Hearst is still alive. But Agent
Charles Bates declined to speculate
further on the prospects of her being
freed.
"I'm sure she's alive and just hope
and pray that she's released safely
some time," Bates said.
The Symbionese Liberation Army,
which claims responsibility for the
kidnaping, warned that Patricia Hearst
would be "executed immediately" if
any attempt was made to rescue her —
"or to injure or to capture our captive
soldiers."

SLA 'Soldiers'
This was an apparent reference to
SLA members Joseph Remiro, 27, and
Russell Little, 24, charged with
murder in the cyanide-bullet
assassination of Oakland School Supt.
Marcus Foster last Nov. 6. They are
being held in San Quentin Prison.
"Once we see compliance with
these specifications and the program
well under way, then, as we have
previously stated, we will begin
negotiations for the release of your

daughter," the SLA said.
The victim's father is Randolph A.
Hearst, president and editor of the San
Francisco Examiner and chairman of
the Hearst Corporation.
In the message, the SLA claimed
the Hearst corporate and personal
wealth "does in fact go into the
hundreds and hundreds of millions.
SLA Message
"Even if Mr. Hearst was to give all
that to the people he could never pay
the people back for the past losses of
freedom nor for the current suffering
that they are now under," the SLA
said.
Contents of the message were first
relayed by television newsman John
Lester — selected by other
correspondents to meet with the
Hearst family as "pool" reporter-who
quoted the message as saying Patricia
Hearst would be held in accordance
with the Geneva Conventions and her
status won't change until the status of
SLA "soldiers" Remiro and Little
changes.
Lester said Patricia Hearst spoke for
only 10 seconds, saying: "Today is
Feb. 19. This morning the Shah of Iran
executed two men at dawn." In two
previous taped communications she
has given similar news items to
pinpoint the day the message was
made.
Dissident Faction
In another development, a letter
whose authors claimed to be defectors
from the Symbionese Liberation Army
condemned yesterday the SLA's
violent tactics in the killing of Oakland
School Supt. Marcus Foster and the
kidnaping of Patricia Hearst.
"We are hiding since the split,
expecting reprisals from the SLA,"
said letters received by the Oakland
Tribune and the San Francisco
Examiner Wednesday night.
"By resorting to abstract violence,
the SLA not only separated itself from
the rest of the revolutionary
movement, but it became the example
to avoid — the stereotype of the 'mad
terrorist' so indispensable to our
oppressors to put us down even more
with new laws and restrictions," the
letter said.
