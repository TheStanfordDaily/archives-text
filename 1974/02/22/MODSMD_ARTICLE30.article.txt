# Sydney Wins Lively Rugby Contest
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Most rugby games are played
before small crowds with little
media attention. But Wednesday's
game between Stanford and
Sydney University was an
exception.
KCBS radio was there along
with other media representatives.
San Jose State player coach Terry
Buchanan was there to video-tape

the action for his rugby class. And
last but not least, that institution
of higher learning from across the
Bay sent representatives from its
rugby team to scout Sydney.
The attraction was an
international rugby match.
Sydney University, two-time
winner of the Australian National
Championships, was playing the
Cards in the next-to-last game of
its second American tour.
The game brought Don Bunce
and John Buckman out of
retirement along with three other
members of the 1972 Card rugby
squad. "Thank God for
Medicare," quipped Lawry
Lieberman, referring to the help
these experienced Indians gave the
Cards.
Sydney put on a good display
of international form, defeating
the Cards 26-0. But according to
Sydney's captain Brian Burnett,
"Stanford didn't play that bad a
game. If they had scored in the
first 10 minutes it probably would
have been a different ball game."
Great Ruckers
Some experienced ruggers were
picking Stanford by three points
over Sydney. San Jose State coach

Buchanan explained his rationale
for picking the Cards. "Sydney
has a lot of great ruckers, but
Stanford's forwards are
outstanding. We lost to both
teams, and I think Stanford was
the better squad," he said.
Both teams appeared to be a
bit rough in the early going, each
missing a penalty kick in the first
couple of minutes. The most
exciting event of the first five
minutes was an unscheduled
appearance by a "streaker."
Actually, Buckman lost his shorts.
The whole event was put in
perspective by a Stanford
"honey." "That's the first time
I've ever seen a 'BA' at a rugby
game," she said.
Sydney started its first scoring
drive in a very unusual way, as
Tony Freestone grabbed a loose
ball on the Card five yard line and
fell on it in the endzone for the
try. Freestone then added the
extra to give Sydney a 6-0 lead.
12 Fumbles
The Cards seemed as though
they couldn't hold on to the ball
as they fumbled it 12 times in the
period. Five times drives were

thwarted by miscues.
Sydney capitalized on one of
those errors to score an
unconverted try just before
halftime. Freestone ran between
three Card defenders for the
score, which gave Sydney a 10-0
halftime lead.
Stanford didn't do a better job
of handling the ball in the second
half. Early in the period the Cards
were five yards from the goal,
only to be stopped by a fumble.
The miscues weren't caused by
Sydney's tackling, either. Sydney
used the rucking technique —
putting the man down and then
stripping him of the ball.
More Scoring
John Taylor, "the Wallaby
Winger" scored twice for Sydney
in the period. Taylor ran 15 yards
for one score and scored the other
on a five-yard run. Freestone
added the final try, picking up an
errant Cardinal pass and running
10 yards into the end zone.
Burnett praised the Cards after
the game. "Stanford had some
good forwards," he said, "but
their backs have a lot of problems.
They played a very physical game,
just like all the other American
teams we've played on the tour.
Stanford has the tendency to play
the man and not the ball, and one
of the fundamental things in
rugby is playing the ball."
Lieberman said, "We played
our best hooking game of the
year. Sydney is just the best team
we've played."
Stanford, now 4-3 on the
season, travels to Davis tomorrow
for a 1:30 p.m. game against
UC-Davis.

just like all the other American
teams we've played on the tour.

the man and not the ball, and one
of the fundamental things in
rugby is playing the ball."
Lieberman said, "We played
our best hooking game of the
year. Sydney is just the best team

Stanford, now 4-3 on the
season, travels to Davis tomorrow
for a 1:30 p.m. game against

Most rugby games are played
before small crowds with little
media attention. But Wednesday's
game between Stanford and
Sydney University was an
exception.
KCBS radio was there along
with other media representatives.
San Jose State player coach Terry
Buchanan was there to video-tape

the action for his rugby class. And
last but not least, that institution
of higher learning from across the
Bay sent representatives from its
rugby team to scout Sydney.
The attraction was an
international rugby match.
Sydney University, two-time
winner of the Australian National
Championships, was playing the
Cards in the next-to-last game of
its second American tour.
The game brought Don Bunce
and John Buckman out of
retirement along with three other
members of the 1972 Card rugby
squad. "Thank God for
Medicare," quipped Lawry
Lieberman, referring to the help
these experienced Indians gave the
Cards.
Sydney put on a good display
of international form, defeating
the Cards 26-0. But according to
Sydney's captain Brian Burnett,
"Stanford didn't play that bad a
game. If they had scored in the
first 10 minutes it probably would
have been a different ball game."
Great Ruckers
Some experienced ruggers were
picking Stanford by three points
over Sydney. San Jose State coach

Buchanan explained his rationale
for picking the Cards. "Sydney
has a lot of great ruckers, but
Stanford's forwards are
outstanding. We lost to both
teams, and I think Stanford was
the better squad," he said.
Both teams appeared to be a
bit rough in the early going, each
missing a penalty kick in the first
couple of minutes. The most
exciting event of the first five
minutes was an unscheduled
appearance by a "streaker."
Actually, Buckman lost his shorts.
The whole event was put in
perspective by a Stanford
"honey." "That's the first time
I've ever seen a 'BA' at a rugby
game," she said.
Sydney started its first scoring
drive in a very unusual way, as
Tony Freestone grabbed a loose
ball on the Card five yard line and
fell on it in the endzone for the
try. Freestone then added the
extra to give Sydney a 6-0 lead.
12 Fumbles
The Cards seemed as though
they couldn't hold on to the ball
as they fumbled it 12 times in the
period. Five times drives were

thwarted by miscues.
Sydney capitalized on one of
those errors to score an
unconverted try just before
halftime. Freestone ran between
three Card defenders for the
score, which gave Sydney a 10-0
halftime lead.
Stanford didn't do a better job
of handling the ball in the second
half. Early in the period the Cards
were five yards from the goal,
only to be stopped by a fumble.
The miscues weren't caused by
Sydney's tackling, either. Sydney
used the rucking technique —
putting the man down and then
stripping him of the ball.
More Scoring
John Taylor, "the Wallaby
Winger" scored twice for Sydney
in the period. Taylor ran 15 yards
for one score and scored the other
on a five-yard run. Freestone
added the final try, picking up an
errant Cardinal pass and running
10 yards into the end zone.
Burnett praised the Cards after
the game. "Stanford had some
good forwards," he said, "but
their backs have a lot of problems.
