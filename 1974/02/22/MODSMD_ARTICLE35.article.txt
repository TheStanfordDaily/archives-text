# JV Cagers Seek Revenge
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Billy Jones' junior varsity cagers get their second
chance this week to avenge an earlier defeat when
they travel south tomorrow night for a 5:45 tangle
with the San Jose State JV.
Last night's battle with the Santa Clara JV (see
insert) was the first of a quartet of JV rematches.
Two of Stanford's remaining contests after
tomorrow will also be second-times-around: Pacific
and California, both of which Stanford has
defeated.
So the prospects look bright for the Cards to
finish the campaign with the winning record they
presently hold. Whether Stanford can take the
powerful Spartans tonight is a more open question.
Surely Jones' squad won't have a better chance
to do so than it had last Jan. 25, when it led the
Spartans by 10 points with 11 minutes left in the
game.
""' Stanford then "folded under pressure," in the
words of assistant coach Bob Buell, and lost the
game 76-71. Buell attributed the multiplicity of
turnovers which precipitated the breakdown to "a
lack of poise in parts" of the contest.
Another major factor were two Spartan recruits
from Los Angeles, freshmen Rick Younge and
Grady Roberts, who scored 43 points between
them. Nevertheless, Jones is following his usual
policy of not designing any special strategy to
counter the opposition.
The Stanford coach admits, however, that the
pair was given too much room to "move in on us"
and says "a little more pressure" on Younge and
Roberts may be the answer.
Playing on a foreign court this time around may
be a disadvantage for Stanford, although Jones
dismisses the factor as "mostly psychological." The
San Jose "crowd" certainly doesn't scare the Card
mentor. "If we were playing in front of 10,000 it
might, but with 150 I don't think so."
One likely prospect is that Stanford will score
more than the 71 points it did in the first meeting.
The Cards have averaged 89 points in their last
three games, compared to 68 in the threesome prior

to the first San Jose contest.
Where the additional baskets will come from is
more nebulous. Scoring patterns on the squad seem
to be shifting slightly as the season progresses.
After Stanford's first six games, guard Terry
McCartin led the Cards in scoring with a 13.9
average, and Marty Moroski was third at 12.5. Prior
to last night's game, the roles were reversed:
Moroski led with 15.6, and McCartin had fallen to
fourth (10.8).
Jones says the coaching staff is anything but
concerned with the change. "It doesn't bother us at
all," assures the Stanford mentor. "We just want
the open man to take the shot â€” we don't care who
it is."

JV JOTS ... Jones will not accompany the
Cardinal varsity to Oregon this weekend, and hence
directed the JV last night and will again
tomorrow.... Moroski will make the trip with the
varsity, leaving Rich Wohlstadter behind to take his
spot on the JV's.
