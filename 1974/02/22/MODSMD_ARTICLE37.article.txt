# Baseball Team Meets Fresno State
## Cardinals Hope For Pitching Revival 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Stanford's baseball team has
played almost flawlessly in nearly
every aspect of the game. Looking
at the fielding, hitting and base
running statistics, one would
think that the Cards are
undefeated. But a fleeting glimpse
(it's too brutal to take any longer)
at the pitching department helps
explain a dismal 2-5 record.
The Cards open a three-game

series at Fresno State at 2:30 p.m.
today. A doubleheader is
scheduled tomorrow at 12 noon.
"It boils down to the fact that
if we can keep the pitchers from
giving up 26 walks in four ball
games, we can win," said Stanford
coach Ray Young after his team's
10-7 loss to unbeaten Santa Clara
Tuesday afternoon in Sunken
Diamond.

The Santa Clara game would
have been quite different to the
Cardinals if one inning was
deleted — a disastrous sixth. In
that frame four Stanford pitchers
gave up eight runs on just two
hits.
Changed Attitude
Until now, Young wasn't
"overly concerned with the win or
the loss."The most important goal
was to evaluate the pitching staff.
So when a Cardinal hurler blew up
on the mount there was no hurry
to send in a reliever because the
purpose of the game was to make
the pitcher experienced. However,
Young has now changed his
attitude. He isn't going to be so
patient.
"We only ask one thing of the
pitchers. That is to throw strikes,"
said Young. "They're not doing
their job. Our pitching is not
coming through."
Young will send Dave Frost,
who pitched a strong eight innings
in a 2-0 loss to Arizona State last
Saturday night, to the mound this
afternoon. A 1 Arthur and Mike
Williamson are scheduled for
tomorrow.
Stanford's team earned run
average is a woeful 5.64, but that
is a deceiving statistic because the
Cards actually lowered that figure
Tuesday while giving up 10 runs.
The base on balls to strikeout
ratio is a little sadder. Card
pitchers have walked 41 men
while striking out 31.
Prepare For Pac-8
Individual E.R.A. records show

Frost with a 3.27, Williamson
5.40, Arthur 6.92 and Bernie
Hittner at 11.0.
"We've just go to stay behind
this club," said Young. "Our
ultimate goal is to prepare for the
conference schedule."
Offensively, the Cardinal marks
are very good. Kim Hannaford
'jads the hitters with a .500
average (9-18). Ken Egusa follows
with a .400 mark and has reached
base 16 times in 27 appearances
to the plate. Other Cards over
.300 are Mark Lucich (.393), Dave
Baker (.333) and Steve Davis
(.320).
On the basepaths the Cards
have stolen 11 bases, well on the
way to surpassing last season's
mark of 39.
"We're running on our own,"
said Young, "We're trying to
teach them to run in different
situations. The hit-and-run has
worked well."
Fresno State has beaten UCLA
and Cal, both Stanford opponents
in the Pacific Eight, so far this
season.

Young will send Dave Frost,
who pitched a strong eight innings
in a 2-0 loss to Arizona State last
Saturday night, to the mound this
afternoon. A 1 Arthur and Mike
Williamson are scheduled for
tomorrow.
Stanford's team earned run
average is a woeful 5.64, but that
is a deceiving statistic because the
Cards actually lowered that figure
Tuesday while giving up 10 runs.
The base on balls to strikeout
ratio is a little sadder. Card
pitchers have walked 41 men
while striking out 31.
Prepare For Pac-8
Individual E.R.A. records show

Frost with a 3.27, Williamson
5.40, Arthur 6.92 and Bernie
Hittner at 11.0.
"We've just go to stay behind
this club," said Young. "Our
ultimate goal is to prepare for the
conference schedule."
Offensively, the Cardinal marks
are very good. Kim Hannaford
'jads the hitters with a .500
average (9-18). Ken Egusa follows
with a .400 mark and has reached
base 16 times in 27 appearances
to the plate. Other Cards over
.300 are Mark Lucich (.393), Dave
Baker (.333) and Steve Davis
(.320).
On the basepaths the Cards
have stolen 11 bases, well on the
way to surpassing last season's
mark of 39.
"We're running on our own,"
said Young, "We're trying to
teach them to run in different
situations. The hit-and-run has
worked well."
Fresno State has beaten UCLA
and Cal, both Stanford opponents
in the Pacific Eight, so far this
season.

Diamond Notes: Team
statistician John Wright considers
this year's team as
"uncharacteristic" compared to
past Card squads. "We're exactly
the opposite. Usually we have fine
pitching," said Wright. Stanford's
junior varsity opens the Bay Area
Collegiate Baseball League
tomorrow with a doubleheader
against Cal at 12 noon on the
junior varsity field.
Stanford's baseball team has
played almost flawlessly in nearly
every aspect of the game. Looking
at the fielding, hitting and base
running statistics, one would
think that the Cards are
undefeated. But a fleeting glimpse
(it's too brutal to take any longer)
at the pitching department helps
explain a dismal 2-5 record.
The Cards open a three-game

series at Fresno State at 2:30 p.m.
today. A doubleheader is
scheduled tomorrow at 12 noon.
"It boils down to the fact that
if we can keep the pitchers from
giving up 26 walks in four ball
games, we can win," said Stanford
coach Ray Young after his team's
10-7 loss to unbeaten Santa Clara
Tuesday afternoon in Sunken
Diamond.

The Santa Clara game would
have been quite different to the
Cardinals if one inning was
deleted — a disastrous sixth. In
that frame four Stanford pitchers
gave up eight runs on just two
hits.
Changed Attitude
Until now, Young wasn't
"overly concerned with the win or
the loss."The most important goal
was to evaluate the pitching staff.
So when a Cardinal hurler blew up
on the mount there was no hurry
to send in a reliever because the
purpose of the game was to make
the pitcher experienced. However,
Young has now changed his
attitude. He isn't going to be so
patient.
"We only ask one thing of the
pitchers. That is to throw strikes,"
said Young. "They're not doing
their job. Our pitching is not
coming through."
