# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
UCLA, hated by opponents
but loved by prognosticators,
last week reversed its role.
Thousands of forecasters,
including the Daily's fearless
one, each week would predict
two UCLA victories. And each
week, the winning percentage
of each prognosticator would
soar upward while frustrated
Bruin opponents suffered the
consequences.
Last weekend, though, the
prognosticators suffered the
consequences as Oregon and
Oregon State decided that
Pac-8 basketball should be less
predictable. The Daily was 4-4,
dropping its season record to a
mediocre 38-16.
This week, the Bruins return
to the friendly confines of
Pauley Pavilion. The Daily will
go out on a limb and predict

that UCLA will snap its
two-game losing streak with
victories over Washington and
Washington State.
In the noisy Northwest, the
Beavers and Ducks should
destroy hapless Cat (even WSU
destroyed the Bears last week),
but the games will be tougher
against hopelessly
unpredictable Stanford. With
the aid of a coin toss and
several mystical visions, the
Daily predicts a Cardinal
victory over OSU and a narrow
defeat in Eugene.
