# Cardinals Travel North To Face Bruin-killers
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Oregon coach Dick Harter said
this week, that "the crowd was a
factor in our win" over UCLA.
"They were a perfect basketball
crowd — the most loyal fans in
the world."
Translation: The eccentric
Duck rooters will be annoying —
to say the least — when the Cards
arrive at noisy McArthur Court
tomorrow night.
Tonight, when Stanford meets
Oregon State in Corvallis, the fans
may be equally boisterous. So
Stanford, now 4-5 in the Pacific
Eight and 10-10 overall, will be
hard pressed to leave the
Northwest with a winning record,
especially with both opponents
fresh from historic victories over
UCLA.
"We don't know how they'll
react lafter the upsets]," said
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar,
"but we do know that Oregon
State is the best overall shooting
team in the conference and that
Oregon plays awfully tough
defense."
In January, both the Ducks
(48-47) and Beavers (56-53)
defeated the Cards at Maples
Pavilion. Stanford was
"disorganized, mixed up and
confused then," according to
assistant coach Bub Bowling, who
emphasized that "we have
progressed considerably since that
weekend."
Streak Snapped
Monday night, though, the
Cards reverted to their dismal
midseason form, shooting only 36
percent from the field in an 84-70
loss to Washington that snapped
Stanford's winning streak at five

games. Two night earlier, the
Cards had waltzed past
Washington State, 72-51.
"It's hard to explain how a
team can shoot so well one night
and so poorly two days later,"
sighed Dallmar. And Bowling
insisted that Stanford played well
enough to win, despite
Washington's blistering .547
percentage from the field. "If we
had shot 42 percent we would
have won," Bowling said. "We had
good shots — we just missed too
many layups."
The travel-weary Cards, who
arrived on campus at 4 a.m.
Tuesday and left for Oregon at
12:30 p.m. yesterday, this
weekend face the task of adjusting
to varying styles of play employed
by the Oregon schools. Oregon
State will most likely play a zone
defense, occasionally using a full
court zone press.
Impenetrable
Oregon, meanwhile, rarely
pressures the ball in the
backcourt, but defends the
20-foot radius around its basket
with a physical — and often
impenetrable — man-to-man
defense. Against UCLA, Duck
center Gerald Willett held Bill
Walton to just 11 points, and last
month at Maples, Rich Kelley
managed only 14 points while
Tim Patterson was shut out and
Ed Schweitzer tallied three points.
Obviously, as Kelley noted, "we'll
need more scoring from the front
line this time."
Oregon State (3-6, 10-11) is led
by massive freshman forward
Lonnie Shelton, center Steve
Ericksen and swingmen Rich
Plante and Paul Miller. Oregon
(6-3, 11-8) features explosive
guard Ron Lee, Willett,
rebounding ace Greg Ballard and
Bruce Coldren, who may or may
not have regained consciousness
after a 12-14 shooting
performance against the Bruins.
The Cards face all three league
contenders — Oregon, USC, and
UCLA — in the next eight days.
"We will be the team that decides
who wins the Pac-8," Bowling
says.

Cardinal Notes: Kelley, who
currently leads the Pac-8 in
scoring with an 18.9 average, was
named Northern California player
of the week for his efforts in
Washington. .. . Both weekend
games will be broadcast live on
KSFO (560 AM). Air times are 8
p.m. . . . About 100
student-faculty tickets for the
UCLA game here on March 2 will
go on sale at 8:30 a.m. on Feb. 27
at the Athletic Department.
Tickets are $1.

"but we do know that Oregon
State is the best overall shooting
team in the conference and that
Oregon plays awfully tough
defense."
In January, both the Ducks
(48-47) and Beavers (56-53)
defeated the Cards at Maples
Pavilion. Stanford was
"disorganized, mixed up and
confused then," according to
assistant coach Bub Bowling, who
emphasized that "we have
progressed considerably since that
weekend."
Streak Snapped
Monday night, though, the
Cards reverted to their dismal
midseason form, shooting only 36
percent from the field in an 84-70
loss to Washington that snapped
Stanford's winning streak at five

games. Two night earlier, the
Cards had waltzed past
Washington State, 72-51.
"It's hard to explain how a
team can shoot so well one night
and so poorly two days later,"
sighed Dallmar. And Bowling
insisted that Stanford played well
enough to win, despite
Washington's blistering .547
percentage from the field. "If we
had shot 42 percent we would
have won," Bowling said. "We had
good shots — we just missed too
many layups."
The travel-weary Cards, who
arrived on campus at 4 a.m.
Tuesday and left for Oregon at
12:30 p.m. yesterday, this
weekend face the task of adjusting
to varying styles of play employed
by the Oregon schools. Oregon
State will most likely play a zone
defense, occasionally using a full
court zone press.
Impenetrable
Oregon, meanwhile, rarely
pressures the ball in the
backcourt, but defends the
20-foot radius around its basket
with a physical — and often
impenetrable — man-to-man
defense. Against UCLA, Duck
center Gerald Willett held Bill
Walton to just 11 points, and last
month at Maples, Rich Kelley
managed only 14 points while
Tim Patterson was shut out and
Ed Schweitzer tallied three points.
Obviously, as Kelley noted, "we'll
need more scoring from the front
line this time."
Oregon State (3-6, 10-11) is led
by massive freshman forward
Lonnie Shelton, center Steve
Ericksen and swingmen Rich
Plante and Paul Miller. Oregon
(6-3, 11-8) features explosive
guard Ron Lee, Willett,
rebounding ace Greg Ballard and
Bruce Coldren, who may or may
not have regained consciousness
after a 12-14 shooting
performance against the Bruins.
The Cards face all three league
contenders — Oregon, USC, and
UCLA — in the next eight days.
"We will be the team that decides
who wins the Pac-8," Bowling
says.

Cardinal Notes: Kelley, who
currently leads the Pac-8 in
scoring with an 18.9 average, was
named Northern California player
of the week for his efforts in
Washington. .. . Both weekend
games will be broadcast live on
KSFO (560 AM). Air times are 8

and so poorly two days later,"
sighed Dallmar. And Bowling
insisted that Stanford played well
enough to win, despite
Washington's blistering .547
percentage from the field. "If we
had shot 42 percent we would
have won," Bowling said. "We had
good shots — we just missed too
many layups."
The travel-weary Cards, who
arrived on campus at 4 a.m.
Tuesday and left for Oregon at
12:30 p.m. yesterday, this
weekend face the task of adjusting
to varying styles of play employed
by the Oregon schools. Oregon
State will most likely play a zone
defense, occasionally using a full
court zone press.
Impenetrable
Oregon, meanwhile, rarely
pressures the ball in the
backcourt, but defends the
20-foot radius around its basket
with a physical — and often
impenetrable — man-to-man
defense. Against UCLA, Duck
center Gerald Willett held Bill
Walton to just 11 points, and last
month at Maples, Rich Kelley
managed only 14 points while
Tim Patterson was shut out and
Ed Schweitzer tallied three points.
Obviously, as Kelley noted, "we'll
need more scoring from the front
line this time."
Oregon State (3-6, 10-11) is led
by massive freshman forward
Lonnie Shelton, center Steve
Ericksen and swingmen Rich
Plante and Paul Miller. Oregon
(6-3, 11-8) features explosive
guard Ron Lee, Willett,
rebounding ace Greg Ballard and
Bruce Coldren, who may or may
not have regained consciousness
after a 12-14 shooting
performance against the Bruins.
The Cards face all three league
contenders — Oregon, USC, and
UCLA — in the next eight days.
"We will be the team that decides
who wins the Pac-8," Bowling
says.

Cardinal Notes: Kelley, who
currently leads the Pac-8 in
scoring with an 18.9 average, was

of the week for his efforts in
Washington. .. . Both weekend
games will be broadcast live on
KSFO (560 AM). Air times are 8
p.m. . . . About 100
student-faculty tickets for the
UCLA game here on March 2 will

at the Athletic Department.
