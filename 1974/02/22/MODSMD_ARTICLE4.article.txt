ATLANTA (AP) - Persons
purporting to be kidnapers of Atlanta
Constitution Editor Reg Murphy sent
a tape recorded message from Murphy
to the newspaper last night and
demanded $700,000 ransom.
William H. Fields, executive editor
of the Constitution and the Atlanta
Journal, said the ransom would be
paid.
Fields played the tape at a news
conference but did not say how the
tape was received.
"I have been kidnaped by the
American Revolutionary Army," a
voice identified as that of Murphy said
in the tape recording. "I wish you
would first tell Virginia [my wife] and
the children that 1 am all right, that I
have been treated with courtesy and
that I have not been abused.
"The American Revolutionary
Army, as I understand it, feels that the
American news media have been too
leftist and too liberal. That is the cause
for my abduction."
Demand $700,000
He continued, "The demand that
they have is a ransom of $700,000.
They understand that I don't have that
kind of wealth and they don't take it
personally. They make the demand
towards the corporation. They tell me
that they would like for it to be in $5,
$10, $20 and $50 denominations."
Murphy disappeared from his home
Wednesday night after being asked by
a man to help him distribute $100,000
worth of heating oil to needy causes.
Sources said Murphy left with a
heavy-set white man who wore a

cowboy hat. The man, in his 20s, was
about 6 feet tall.
Fields said the newspaper will pay
the ransom as soon as it is "apprised of
the method and time."
Telephone Call
The recorded message said his
kidnapers would call "at random"
someone in the Atlanta metropolitan
area.
"They will be given the demand
and will expect the person who is
called to call you," the voice on the
tape said.
Moments after the tape was made
public, a spokesman for the family,
Jim Rankin of the Constitution, said
Mrs. Murphy was relieved when she
heard the tape.
Family 'Encouraged'
"The family is encouraged by the
development," Rankin said. "He
[Murphy] sounded very serious. There
is no doubt that it was Reg."
"The American Revolutionary
Army tells me that they intend in the
future to engage in guerrilla warfare
throughout the country," Murphy
said.
No Bloodshed Yet
'They don't intend to engage in
bloodshed at this time. One of their
significant demands is that all federal
government officials resign and that
free elections be held in the future."
He said the group originally had
planned to abduct him at about the
same time the Symbionese Liberation
Army abducted Patricia Hearst, but
there were circumstances "which made
it difficult to do that at that time."

it difficult to do that at that time."
ATLANTA (AP) - Persons
purporting to be kidnapers of Atlanta
Constitution Editor Reg Murphy sent
a tape recorded message from Murphy
to the newspaper last night and
demanded $700,000 ransom.
William H. Fields, executive editor
of the Constitution and the Atlanta
Journal, said the ransom would be
paid.
Fields played the tape at a news
conference but did not say how the
tape was received.
"I have been kidnaped by the
American Revolutionary Army," a
voice identified as that of Murphy said
in the tape recording. "I wish you
would first tell Virginia [my wife] and
the children that 1 am all right, that I
have been treated with courtesy and
that I have not been abused.
"The American Revolutionary
Army, as I understand it, feels that the
American news media have been too
leftist and too liberal. That is the cause
for my abduction."
Demand $700,000
He continued, "The demand that
they have is a ransom of $700,000.
They understand that I don't have that
kind of wealth and they don't take it
personally. They make the demand
towards the corporation. They tell me
that they would like for it to be in $5,
$10, $20 and $50 denominations."
Murphy disappeared from his home
Wednesday night after being asked by
a man to help him distribute $100,000
worth of heating oil to needy causes.
Sources said Murphy left with a
heavy-set white man who wore a

cowboy hat. The man, in his 20s, was
about 6 feet tall.
Fields said the newspaper will pay
the ransom as soon as it is "apprised of
the method and time."
Telephone Call
The recorded message said his
kidnapers would call "at random"
someone in the Atlanta metropolitan
area.
"They will be given the demand
and will expect the person who is
called to call you," the voice on the
tape said.
Moments after the tape was made
public, a spokesman for the family,
Jim Rankin of the Constitution, said
Mrs. Murphy was relieved when she
heard the tape.
Family 'Encouraged'
"The family is encouraged by the
development," Rankin said. "He
[Murphy] sounded very serious. There
is no doubt that it was Reg."
"The American Revolutionary
Army tells me that they intend in the
future to engage in guerrilla warfare
throughout the country," Murphy
said.
No Bloodshed Yet
'They don't intend to engage in
bloodshed at this time. One of their
significant demands is that all federal
government officials resign and that
free elections be held in the future."
He said the group originally had
planned to abduct him at about the
same time the Symbionese Liberation
Army abducted Patricia Hearst, but
there were circumstances "which made
it difficult to do that at that time."
