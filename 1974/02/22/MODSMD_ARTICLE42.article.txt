# Women's Cagers Loss Partly Blamed On Refs
## 
### CHRISTA BATTELLE 
The Stanford women's varsity
basketball team suffered a 42-27
loss to Cal State-Hayward and the
referees Wednesday night. The
precision playing of Hayward
coupled with a number of
questionable calls in the last half
caused Stanford's second straight
loss to Hayward.
"We wouldn't have won
tonight anyway but the refereeing
sure didn't help," said one
Stanford player. Stanford's play
couldn't stand up to Hayward's
accurate passing and offensive
organization, especially in the
second half.
But even if the play had been
better, at times it seemed like the
team wasn't even getting a chance
to close up the score, as foul after
foul was called on Stanford for
infractions that it appeared both
teams were committing.
Hayward's JV team did a
credible, if somewhat off-key, job
of singing Hayward fight songs
during the varsity game. This
demoralizing factor undoubtedly

contributed to Stanford's loss.
Cardinal manager Laurel
Treon, commenting on team
morale and the JV's impressive
51-22 victory over Hayward, said,
"Our JV's sometimes seem to
have a lot more spark than the
varsity. It could be the lack of
pressure. ..
The varsity was under pressure
from the start. "We knew
Hayward was the hardest game we
had to play this year," said one
player. Kathy Levinson, guard,
was high scorer for the varsity
with 10 points, followed by
Nancy Anderson, forward, with
seven. Marina Ballantyne and
Velinda Paranal also played well
against Hayward.
The JV's were led in scoring by
Carol Sawyer who collected 17
points and Karen Stromsmoe with
nine.
The women's basketball team
goes against Santa Clara on Feb.
26, and then heads to Sacramento
for a regional qualifying
tournament in which 10 collegiate
teams will compete.

Treon, commenting on team
morale and the JV's impressive
51-22 victory over Hayward, said,
"Our JV's sometimes seem to
have a lot more spark than the
varsity. It could be the lack of
pressure. ..
The varsity was under pressure
from the start. "We knew
Hayward was the hardest game we
had to play this year," said one
player. Kathy Levinson, guard,
was high scorer for the varsity
with 10 points, followed by
Nancy Anderson, forward, with
seven. Marina Ballantyne and
Velinda Paranal also played well
against Hayward.
The JV's were led in scoring by
Carol Sawyer who collected 17
points and Karen Stromsmoe with
nine.
The women's basketball team
goes against Santa Clara on Feb.
26, and then heads to Sacramento
for a regional qualifying
tournament in which 10 collegiate
teams will compete.
