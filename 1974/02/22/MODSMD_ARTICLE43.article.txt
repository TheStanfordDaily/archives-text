# Shoots Poorly But Plays Well
## Gilberg Excels, Disappoints 
### JIM WASCHER 
Junior guard Mark Gilberg's fortunes this season
have been as mixed as his team's record. Although
Gilberg's coaches have praised his aggressive
defensive play, they must also reckon with his
disastrous .265 shooting percentage from the floor
when they select a starting lineup each week.
Coach Howie Dallmar believes that "Mark's only
problem is that his jump shot is more of a push
shot and he has to worry about being blocked. As
soon as he gets over that feeling, he's going to be a
lot better off."
Gilberg, who averaged 34 points a game during
his senior year at Lowell High School in San
Francisco, said "naturally I'm not going to shoot as
much as I did in high school." He explains that
"when you've got so much talent in the big guys,
you've got to have them shoot if you want to win."
His 6-0 stature is another reason for his
reluctance to shoot. "You've got to make some
kind of adjustment to players who are much taller
than you, even if they're not guarding you,"
Gilberg says.
"For me, there's not much difference between a
guy who's 6-6 and a guy who's 7-0. They can both
block my shots."
Compensates For Shooting
Even though Gilberg isn't exactly setting the
nets on fire with his outside shooting, he more than
compensates for that with his reliable team
quarterbacking and alert defensive play.
"The greatest asset he has," according to
Dallmar, "is that he is a team leader in his quiet
way. And it's amazing the number of rebounds he
gets because of his aggressiveness." (Gilberg has 25
caroms this season, but had 44 last year.)
Gilberg also has the team's best free throw
shooting percentage (.857). His five shots from the
charity stripe against Washington State here two
weeks ago never touched the rim.
After averaging 9.5 points a game and shooting
.476 from the floor for Bub Bowling's 1972 frosh
squad, Gilberg started in nearly every game last
season and averaged six points a game.
Competition
Senior Jim Montague beat him out for the
starting "point" spot this year, but Gilberg bumped
Montague from the lineup before the Holiday
Festival in New York last December.
Gilberg won back the spot, according to
Bowling, "because he doesn't panic. At least we
know he'll get the ball upcourt." Nevertheless, after
starting in only four games, Gilberg himself was
displaced by Ben Bluitt. Since then, of course,
Montague has retaken the position.
"I think it's been frustrating for all the guards,"
says Gilberg. "We've sort of been going in cycles."
However, he said the lineup which includes
Montague seems to be "a winning combination —
you've got to go with that no matter what."
Despite the occasionally fierce competition
between Gilberg, Montague and Bluitt, the two
who do not start "don't build up animosity

towards the other player because we've all been in
the same situation."
Academic Pressure
Gilberg is similarly unconcerned about two
other traditional banes to athletes: hostile or
indifferent crowds and the pressures to academic
work.
Although he says that "sometimes I don't know
whether Maples is a home court,"he adds "you
couldn't really blame the fans for their lack of
enthusiasm. We were playing so badly and they
want to see a good ball game."
Even so, Gilberg says "if you let the crowd
affect you, you're really not paying attention to
the game."
As a chemistry major, Gilberg might be excused
for occasionally having something other than
basketball on his mind when he is on court, but he
believes "it's not fair to the other guys on the team
if you don't hustle or don't put out because you
had a bad day."
From his size to his major to his attitude about
being displaced on the starting lineup, Mark Gilberg
is one of the more unusual players on an unusual
squad.

MARK GILBERG
Junior guard Mark Gilberg's fortunes this season
have been as mixed as his team's record. Although
Gilberg's coaches have praised his aggressive
defensive play, they must also reckon with his
disastrous .265 shooting percentage from the floor
when they select a starting lineup each week.
Coach Howie Dallmar believes that "Mark's only
problem is that his jump shot is more of a push
shot and he has to worry about being blocked. As
soon as he gets over that feeling, he's going to be a
lot better off."
Gilberg, who averaged 34 points a game during
his senior year at Lowell High School in San
Francisco, said "naturally I'm not going to shoot as
much as I did in high school." He explains that
"when you've got so much talent in the big guys,
you've got to have them shoot if you want to win."
His 6-0 stature is another reason for his
reluctance to shoot. "You've got to make some
kind of adjustment to players who are much taller
than you, even if they're not guarding you,"
Gilberg says.
"For me, there's not much difference between a
guy who's 6-6 and a guy who's 7-0. They can both
block my shots."
Compensates For Shooting
Even though Gilberg isn't exactly setting the
nets on fire with his outside shooting, he more than
compensates for that with his reliable team
quarterbacking and alert defensive play.
"The greatest asset he has," according to
Dallmar, "is that he is a team leader in his quiet
way. And it's amazing the number of rebounds he
gets because of his aggressiveness." (Gilberg has 25
caroms this season, but had 44 last year.)
Gilberg also has the team's best free throw
shooting percentage (.857). His five shots from the
charity stripe against Washington State here two
weeks ago never touched the rim.
After averaging 9.5 points a game and shooting
.476 from the floor for Bub Bowling's 1972 frosh
squad, Gilberg started in nearly every game last
season and averaged six points a game.
Competition
Senior Jim Montague beat him out for the
starting "point" spot this year, but Gilberg bumped
Montague from the lineup before the Holiday
Festival in New York last December.
Gilberg won back the spot, according to
Bowling, "because he doesn't panic. At least we
know he'll get the ball upcourt." Nevertheless, after
starting in only four games, Gilberg himself was
displaced by Ben Bluitt. Since then, of course,
Montague has retaken the position.
"I think it's been frustrating for all the guards,"
says Gilberg. "We've sort of been going in cycles."
However, he said the lineup which includes
Montague seems to be "a winning combination —
you've got to go with that no matter what."
Despite the occasionally fierce competition
between Gilberg, Montague and Bluitt, the two
who do not start "don't build up animosity

towards the other player because we've all been in
the same situation."
Academic Pressure
Gilberg is similarly unconcerned about two
other traditional banes to athletes: hostile or
indifferent crowds and the pressures to academic
work.
Although he says that "sometimes I don't know
whether Maples is a home court,"he adds "you
couldn't really blame the fans for their lack of
enthusiasm. We were playing so badly and they
want to see a good ball game."
Even so, Gilberg says "if you let the crowd
affect you, you're really not paying attention to
the game."
