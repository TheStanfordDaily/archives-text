Nixon Seeks Drug Traffic Penally
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked
Congress yesterday for new minimum jail sentences
for narcotics traffickers.
"More than a quarter of those who are convicted
of narcotics trafficking do not serve a single day
behind bars," Nixon said. He asked Congress in a
written message to close that and other "loopholes
in the criminal justice system."
The minimum jail sentence of three years for a
first offender was, however, less than Nixon
requested last year in his crime message.
John Bartels, administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, said this softening
reflects changes in the pattern of drug traffic,
including less involvement by organized crime than
a year ago.
Nixon also asked for a three-year minimum
sentence for repeat offenders in non-narcotics drug
trafficking, which includes dealing in amphetamines,
barbiturates and marijuana. And he requested that
judges be empowered to deny bail in certain drug
trafficking cases.
Impeachment Grounds Widened
WASHINGTON - The House Judiciary
Committee, investigating the possible impeachment
of President Nixon, was advised by its staff
yesterday that impeachable offenses need not be
criminal acts.
The advice, quickly rejected by the ranking
Republican member of the committee, was
contained in a staff memorandum exploring in
general terms the constitutional grounds for
impeachment of a president.
In its most significant finding, the memorandum
states that criminal law is not applicable to the
process of removing a president from office.
"The criminal law ... does not address itself to
the abuses of presidential power," says the
memorandum. "In an impeachment proceeding a
president is called to account for abusing powers
which only a president possesses."
Chairman Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., and Rep.
Edward Hutchinson, R-Mich., at a news conference

at which the memorandum was distributed, made it
clear it in no way reflected the committee's position
on the crucial question of what constitutes an
impeachable offense.
Rodino called it a useful tool that would help the
members make up their individual minds when it
comes time to vote on whether grounds exist for
impeaching Nixon.
Kissinger Outlines 'New Dialogue"
MEXICO CITY — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger pledged the United States to a new spirit
of brotherhood with nations of Latin America
yesterday, seeking neither to intervene in their
domestic affairs nor to impose political preferences.
"We meet here as equals — representatives of our
individual modes of life, but united by one
aspiration — to build a new community," Kissinger
told the foreign ministers of 24 hemisphere
countries in a broad outline of his long-promised
"new dialogue."
The secretary indicated the Nixon administration
is ready to submit new legislation to modify current
restrictions on U.S. aid to countries that expropriate
properties of American firms.
He also proposed conciliation machinery to iron
out such disputes and said hemisphere nations
should meet on a regular basis. His speech
significantly omitted any reference to Communist
Cuba, whose economic isolation the United States
continues to advocate. Cuba was not present at the
meeting in the Mexican Foreign Ministry's
modernistic tower building.
Committee Stalls Pay Raise Veto
WASHINGTON — House action on vetoing
President Nixon's pay raise for top federal officials,
including a $10,000-a-year raise for congressmen,
was blocked yesterday in committee.
Fourteen members kept a veto resolution against
the pay raise bottled up in the House Post Office
Committee by preventing a quorum to vote it out
for full House action.
The defeat appeared to leave only a Senate veto

in the way of the raise, although Rep. H. R. Gross,
R-lowa, said he will not give up his effort to get a
House veto vote.
Asked if he thought the 14 members had
boycotted yesterday's meeting to prevent a vote on
his veto resolution, Gross replied, "They weren't
here, were they?"
The outspoken critic of federal spending
immediately began circulating a discharge petition
to try to force the veto resolution out of the
committee and on to the House floor.
Nixon's pay raise plan, unless vetoed by either
the House or Senate by March 6, will raise
congressmen's pay from the present $42,500 to
$45,700 next year, $49,100 in 1975 and $52,800 in
1976.
Oil Trust-Busting 'Softened'
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee made
public yesterday 20-year-old government directives
softening antitrust prosecution of an international
oil cartel in the interest of national security.
Chairman Frank Church, D-Idaho, said the
documents were declassified only this month for use
in the investigation by the Foreign Relations
subcommittee on multinational corporations on the
role of oil companies in U.S. foreign policy.
Church said the documents from files of the
Truman and Eisenhower administrations
demonstrated a conflict between the Justice
Department desire to break up the cartel and the
interest of the State Department in establishing a
free world foothold in oil-rich Iran.
"There was growing concern in the State
Department that Iran was going to slip within the
Soviet orbit," Church said in a preface to the
printed documents.
