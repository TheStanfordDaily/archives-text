# Panelists Debate Uses Of Student Power
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Students and administrators
disagreed significantly last night on the
role of students in running the
University.
At a panel discussion on
"University Governance: Tales from
the Superstructure," former ASSU
Vice President Brent Appel and
current Vice President Jim Friend
contended that the University
administration frequently gives only
lip-service to the idea of student
participation in decision-making.
But Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs and Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons disagreed.
Because "governance of the University
on a day-to-day basis is very boring,"

said Gibbs, students tend to focus on
issues only after they become
controversial.
Speaking before just 15 people in
Annenberg Auditorium, Appel
contended that the University is
actually controled by a "small elite"
of corporate executives and donors.
He contended that there are few
areas where the students and faculty
have any real authority over University
decisions.
According to Gibbs, however, the
faculty is actually the most powerful
group. The power of the University
president and the Board of Trustees is
actually "over-emphasized."
The Trustees have to rely on the
expertise of University administrators

because they don't have the time to be
informed, Gibbs explained. He cited
tenure as one issue where the faculty
has more influence than do the
Trustees, since the issue concerns
faculty directly.
Gibbs said the person with "the
least absolute power in the University"
is the president. Department chairmen
have the most absolute freedom, he
asserted.
The panel members agreed that
there is room for more student input
into University governance, but
offered different suggestions for
increasing that input. Lyons said the
recent controversy over the Row
faculty housing project showed that
the way for students to influence

University governance is to ask
questions.
"On the Row project, we didn't
give very good answers," Lyons said.
"It's back on the table, because we
couldn't answer some questions."
Appel said students should work at
"the lowest levels" to affect the
University. He said students should go
to department chairmen with specific
questions about hiring and other
department policies.
Student input should be constantly
shifting without getting bogged down
on one point, Appel said. When
students reach an impasse with the
University, they should "bail out
before the University engulfs them."
