# Union President Asks Non-Unit Employees To Support USE Bargaining Position
## 
### DON COX 
Jim Berk, president of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union,
warned last night that if employees
outside of the union's bargaining unit
do nothing to protect themselves,
"anything the unit people get will be
at the expense of the non-unit
people."
Berk said to 10 people at Tresidder
that the only way non-unit members
could protect themselves is by
cooperating with the unit, which is
currently engaged in contract
negotiations with the University.
Berk recommended
"piggy-backing" by the non-unit
employees, whereby they would
formulate demands of their own to
present to the University. If this was
done in cooperation with the USE,
Berk said that they would be

protected by the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRB).
"The best way non-unit people can
protect themselves is as a group. They
should set up a set of demands and
approach the unit," Berk said. He
explained that the bargaining unit can
represent union members outside of
the unit and negotiate for them.
Strike Tactics
If there is a strike, Berk said, "well
go out together and neither will go
back until all demands are met.
Everybody ought to piggy-back and
get what they can."
"Most members seem to think that
the only choice a non-unit employee
has is whether or not to cross the
picket line," said Berk. However, they
can become actively involved, he said.
"If the non-unit people continue to
sit on their hands, they will be of no

help to the union or to themselves.
When the squeeze comes, the
University will lay off non-unit people
first since the unit will kick up a fuss
over any unit member that is laid off,"
Berk contended.
Out of a total union membership of
1400, 300 people are not in the
bargaining unit, Berk said.
Other Unionization Efforts
"Other groups of workers have
been trying to further their own gains
because of the confrontation"
between the USE and the University,
Berk said. He referred specifically to
the physics graduate students and their
efforts to unionize.
"If they had done this a year or
two ago, they would have had a lot
less effect and it would have been
worth less to them," Berk said.
Berk said that he approved of their

efforts but that he'd "like to see them
cooperate with us" for their own
protection and to strengthen the unit's
bargaining position.
"It's really a case of hang together
or go down together," said Berk.
Non-Unit Concerns
Roland Finston, senior health
physicist, was "concerned that once
the unit fulfilled its demands it might
not want to stay out on strike for the
small number of non-unit employees
who were also negotiating for their
demands."
Julia Harvey, a medical research
assistant concerned about how to
approach non-unit people, said that
"we shouldn't emphasize the
P'ggy-backing, but that the union's
demands are in fact everyone's."
Berk said he did not think a strike
was inevitable, though the possibility
remained. He noted that the
University and union negotiating
teams had not yet discussed the
money issues in the contract.
Shut Down 'Not Possible'
"It appears that unit people are
enough of a minority that it is not
going to be possible to shut down the
University in a strike situation,"
Finston said.
Finston contended that it is
"premature and suicidal for us to go
on strike. It is very hard to convince
the average employee that if he goes
out on strike he is going to get his job
back," Finston added.
Berk disagreed and said that "we
are going to get more than
management thought."
Union Support
While recognizing that "no one
likes a strike," Berk said he's confident
that the union would support a strike
vote should it come to that.
He said that all negotiating
concessions by the University to date
were "meaningless" because the
University "was making concessions
from unrealistic positions."
Berk warned that the University
negotiating strategy "could lead to a
strike" and that they underestimated
"how employees feel about these
things."

Julia Harvey, a medical research
assistant concerned about how to
approach non-unit people, said that
"we shouldn't emphasize the
P'ggy-backing, but that the union's
demands are in fact everyone's."
Berk said he did not think a strike
was inevitable, though the possibility
remained. He noted that the
University and union negotiating
teams had not yet discussed the
money issues in the contract.
Shut Down 'Not Possible'
"It appears that unit people are
enough of a minority that it is not
going to be possible to shut down the
University in a strike situation,"
Finston said.
Finston contended that it is
"premature and suicidal for us to go
on strike. It is very hard to convince
the average employee that if he goes
out on strike he is going to get his job
back," Finston added.
Berk disagreed and said that "we
are going to get more than
management thought."
Union Support
While recognizing that "no one
likes a strike," Berk said he's confident
that the union would support a strike
vote should it come to that.
He said that all negotiating
concessions by the University to date
were "meaningless" because the
University "was making concessions
from unrealistic positions."
Berk warned that the University
negotiating strategy "could lead to a
strike" and that they underestimated
"how employees feel about these
things."
Jim Berk, president of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union,
warned last night that if employees
outside of the union's bargaining unit
do nothing to protect themselves,
"anything the unit people get will be
at the expense of the non-unit
people."
Berk said to 10 people at Tresidder
that the only way non-unit members
could protect themselves is by
cooperating with the unit, which is
currently engaged in contract
negotiations with the University.
Berk recommended
"piggy-backing" by the non-unit
employees, whereby they would
formulate demands of their own to
present to the University. If this was
done in cooperation with the USE,
Berk said that they would be

protected by the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRB).
"The best way non-unit people can
protect themselves is as a group. They
should set up a set of demands and
approach the unit," Berk said. He
explained that the bargaining unit can
represent union members outside of
the unit and negotiate for them.
Strike Tactics
If there is a strike, Berk said, "well
go out together and neither will go
back until all demands are met.
Everybody ought to piggy-back and
get what they can."
"Most members seem to think that
the only choice a non-unit employee
has is whether or not to cross the
picket line," said Berk. However, they
can become actively involved, he said.
"If the non-unit people continue to
sit on their hands, they will be of no

help to the union or to themselves.
When the squeeze comes, the
University will lay off non-unit people
first since the unit will kick up a fuss
over any unit member that is laid off,"
Berk contended.
Out of a total union membership of
1400, 300 people are not in the
bargaining unit, Berk said.
Other Unionization Efforts
"Other groups of workers have
been trying to further their own gains
because of the confrontation"
between the USE and the University,
Berk said. He referred specifically to
the physics graduate students and their
efforts to unionize.
"If they had done this a year or
two ago, they would have had a lot
less effect and it would have been
worth less to them," Berk said.
Berk said that he approved of their

efforts but that he'd "like to see them
cooperate with us" for their own
protection and to strengthen the unit's
bargaining position.
"It's really a case of hang together
or go down together," said Berk.
Non-Unit Concerns
Roland Finston, senior health
physicist, was "concerned that once
the unit fulfilled its demands it might
not want to stay out on strike for the
small number of non-unit employees
who were also negotiating for their
demands."
Julia Harvey, a medical research
assistant concerned about how to
approach non-unit people, said that
"we shouldn't emphasize the
P'ggy-backing, but that the union's
