# Assemblyman Arnett Analyzes Politics, Stanford
## 
### ROBERT BACON Second of Two Parts 
SACRAMENTO — "There's probably more
legitimate interest and activity in the political
process on the campuses now than during the
19605." according to Dixon Arnett, Stanford
administrator turned state Assemblyman.
"I don't see politics waning away on the
campuses .... Pounding doorbells is a lot more
meaningful than throwing bricks.... The
rock-throwing never involved more than a very
small minority of people."
Arnett, R-Redwood City, minority whip of
the state Assembly, discussed politics and his
relation to the University with the Daily at the
State Capitol last week.
Wearing a tie emblazoned with yellow
elephants, he opined that Watergate and related
scandals wouldn't be an albatross around
Republican necks this year, "at least not in this
state."
Confidence
"All candidates will have to try to prove that
people can have confidence in us, more so than
usual this year.... But the electorate that I
serve demanded it long before it became
fashionable," he continued.
Arnett's district, little changed by

reapportionment, reaches from San Mateo
through most of Menlo Park.
Almost without exception, voters in
California will choose a "youthful, energetic,
sincere" candidate who promises to work hard,
"almost irrespective of party affiliation or
strong philosophical bent," he said.
Gut Feeling
"It's a gut feeling — they vote for someone
they can trust," even though they know they
will not always agree with their representative's
views, according to Arnett.
Arnett, 36 and a 1960 Stanford graduate, has
been active in politics since he was in high
school. He has participated in many Republican
organizations in San Mateo County, and served
as a City Councilman in Redwood City before
being elected to the Legislature in 1970.
He was reelected in 1972 and is seeking a
third term this year.
Asked if he had higher political ambitions, he
replied without a moment's hesitation, "Sure."
He elaborated, "That doesn't mean that I jump
at any chance," pointing out that he turned
down an opportunity to run for the state Senate
this year. "But someday I hope to move beyond
the Assembly."
He lamented that reapportionment had

removed East Palo Alto from his district, since
that predominantly black community in San
Mateo County will now have an assemblyman
oriented toward Santa Clara County.
"It's unfortunately treating them like a
stepchild, and in the past that's been the source
of many of their problems," he said.
Among the University-related issues in which
Arnett has been involved is the deputization of
University police officers, which has given them
full arrest powers.
Police
Last year, when deputization appeared
stymied by the failure of an Arnett-sponsored
bill to deputize University patrolmen and by an
advisory opinion on the state Attorney General
saying that full-time law enforcement officers
could not be deputized into the sheriff's
reserves, Arnett submitted the specific facts of
the Stanford situation to the Attorney General's
office and sought a new opinion.
The Attorney General's office reversed itself
and decided that Stanford officers could receive
full police powers by becoming reserve deputies,
even though Stanford continued to pay them.
Arnett expressed satisfaction that the issue
was resolved locally, and not through the
Legislature. He explained the Attorney

General's turnaround by pointing out that "the
Stanford situation is unique, and I don't think
they really understood the issue" when
preparing the first opinion.
Definition Of Death
Arnett and his staff are currently studying
the legal problems of defining death. This
question has philosophical and theological
overtones which assume great practical
importance when a person who has been
murdered is used as a donor for a heart
transplant. Under present law there is no
definition.
In an Oakland case, a defendant was found
guilty of second degree murder in the death of a
man whose heart was taken for transplantation
to Stanford Medical Center.
Referring to the second-degree verdict,
Arnett said "the jury copped out" on the
critical question of whether the victim's death
was caused by the shooting or by the removal of
his heart.
He said the prospect remains of a malpractice
action against the doctors involved. Hence, the
California Medical Association and other groups
are pondering the ramifications of a legal
definition of death to remove uncertainty in
future cases.

Arnett, 36 and a 1960 Stanford graduate, has
been active in politics since he was in high
school. He has participated in many Republican
organizations in San Mateo County, and served
as a City Councilman in Redwood City before
being elected to the Legislature in 1970.
He was reelected in 1972 and is seeking a
third term this year.
Asked if he had higher political ambitions, he
replied without a moment's hesitation, "Sure."
He elaborated, "That doesn't mean that I jump
at any chance," pointing out that he turned
down an opportunity to run for the state Senate
this year. "But someday I hope to move beyond
the Assembly."
He lamented that reapportionment had

removed East Palo Alto from his district, since
that predominantly black community in San
Mateo County will now have an assemblyman
oriented toward Santa Clara County.
"It's unfortunately treating them like a
stepchild, and in the past that's been the source
of many of their problems," he said.
Among the University-related issues in which
Arnett has been involved is the deputization of
University police officers, which has given them
full arrest powers.
Police
Last year, when deputization appeared
stymied by the failure of an Arnett-sponsored
bill to deputize University patrolmen and by an
advisory opinion on the state Attorney General
saying that full-time law enforcement officers
could not be deputized into the sheriff's
reserves, Arnett submitted the specific facts of
the Stanford situation to the Attorney General's
office and sought a new opinion.
The Attorney General's office reversed itself
and decided that Stanford officers could receive
full police powers by becoming reserve deputies,
even though Stanford continued to pay them.
Arnett expressed satisfaction that the issue
was resolved locally, and not through the
Legislature. He explained the Attorney

General's turnaround by pointing out that "the
Stanford situation is unique, and I don't think
they really understood the issue" when
preparing the first opinion.
Definition Of Death
Arnett and his staff are currently studying
the legal problems of defining death. This
question has philosophical and theological
overtones which assume great practical
importance when a person who has been
murdered is used as a donor for a heart
transplant. Under present law there is no
definition.
In an Oakland case, a defendant was found
guilty of second degree murder in the death of a
man whose heart was taken for transplantation
to Stanford Medical Center.
Referring to the second-degree verdict,
Arnett said "the jury copped out" on the
critical question of whether the victim's death
was caused by the shooting or by the removal of
his heart.
He said the prospect remains of a malpractice
action against the doctors involved. Hence, the
California Medical Association and other groups
are pondering the ramifications of a legal
definition of death to remove uncertainty in
future cases.

SACRAMENTO — "There's probably more
legitimate interest and activity in the political
process on the campuses now than during the
19605." according to Dixon Arnett, Stanford
administrator turned state Assemblyman.
"I don't see politics waning away on the
campuses .... Pounding doorbells is a lot more
meaningful than throwing bricks.... The
rock-throwing never involved more than a very
small minority of people."
Arnett, R-Redwood City, minority whip of
the state Assembly, discussed politics and his
relation to the University with the Daily at the
State Capitol last week.
Wearing a tie emblazoned with yellow
elephants, he opined that Watergate and related
scandals wouldn't be an albatross around
Republican necks this year, "at least not in this
state."
Confidence
"All candidates will have to try to prove that
people can have confidence in us, more so than
usual this year.... But the electorate that I
serve demanded it long before it became
fashionable," he continued.
Arnett's district, little changed by

reapportionment, reaches from San Mateo
through most of Menlo Park.
Almost without exception, voters in
California will choose a "youthful, energetic,
sincere" candidate who promises to work hard,
"almost irrespective of party affiliation or
strong philosophical bent," he said.

"It's a gut feeling — they vote for someone
they can trust," even though they know they

office and sought a new opinion.
The Attorney General's office reversed itself
and decided that Stanford officers could receive
full police powers by becoming reserve deputies,
even though Stanford continued to pay them.
Arnett expressed satisfaction that the issue
was resolved locally, and not through the
Legislature. He explained the Attorney

General's turnaround by pointing out that "the
Stanford situation is unique, and I don't think
they really understood the issue" when
preparing the first opinion.
Definition Of Death
Arnett and his staff are currently studying
the legal problems of defining death. This
question has philosophical and theological
overtones which assume great practical
importance when a person who has been
murdered is used as a donor for a heart
transplant. Under present law there is no
definition.
In an Oakland case, a defendant was found
guilty of second degree murder in the death of a
man whose heart was taken for transplantation
to Stanford Medical Center.
Referring to the second-degree verdict,
Arnett said "the jury copped out" on the
critical question of whether the victim's death
was caused by the shooting or by the removal of
his heart.
He said the prospect remains of a malpractice
action against the doctors involved. Hence, the
California Medical Association and other groups
are pondering the ramifications of a legal
definition of death to remove uncertainty in
future cases.
