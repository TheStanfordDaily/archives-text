# On Shockley-- Is Yale Yellow?
##

Tim Ferguson

Few events strike the soul as
being so repulsive as those which
depict academia in full-fledged
retreat from its promise of
intellectual freedom. We have
gotten a glimpse of academic
cowardice in action once more
this week; paradoxically, but not
surprisingly, the white flag was
hoisted in New Haven, Conn.
There, in the bastion of
unencumbered thought men were
once proud to call Yale
University, the prospect of what
Neaisweek (Dec. 17, 1973) called
"leftist bullying" caused the Yale
Political Union to rescind its
invitations to Electrical
Engineering Prof. William
Shockley and Congress of Racial
Equality director Roy Innis to
debate the former's controversial
views on genetics.
And, no sooner has the Union
canceled its welcome and a second
organization begun to consider its
own bid to the two men than the
university's governing body, the
Yale Corporation, and its
renowned president, Kingman
Brewster, joined the blighted
bandwagon of de facto
censorship.
Provocative Invitation
Calling the suspected second
invitation a "provocation" and
fearing "the entire community is
being used," the Yale Corporation
praised the Union for "a difficult
decision."
Brewster, long-known for an
affinity to swerve from the
traditions of his institution when
the winds of "academic thought"
are blowing counter, endorsed the
Corporation's stand and also its
half-hearted agreement not to
forbid the second organization,
Lux et Veritas, from sponsoring
the debate.
"The best way to avoid playing
into the hands of the sponsors,"
the president said in a statement,
".. . the best way to show one's
scorn and distaste for this
provocation, is to leave the
speakers to an audience of their
sponsors."
'Gracious Welcome'
How gracious a welcome to
thoughtful inquiry by the man
who once found violent anti-war

protest an excusable outgrowth of
strongly-held beliefs.
Would such a man unilaterally
shunt aside public debate of an
issue of extreme emotional
impact? Oh no, not Kingman
Brewster. "Official suppression,"
said the Yale president, "would
only dignify the occasion."
A statement by Lux et Veritas
director Thomas E. Spahn, seems
to indicate, however, that
Brewster and the Yale
Corporation jumped the gun in
their eagerness to allow/condemn
the second invitation.
"Neither .. . contacted us,"
said Spahn. ".. .No invitations to
Shockley or Innis have been
sent."
Partners-in-Crime
For purposes of argument, and
not for adopting a university
policy, let's safely assume that
such an invitation will be made.
What then? Will Yale fall by the
way of its partners-in-crime,
Harvard, Princeton, and Staten
Island Community College, and
back down at the last moment
from providing the conditions
agreed to by Shockley and Innis?
Apparently neither debator
hopes so. In fact, Shockley has
already challenged Brewster and
his fellows at Dartmouth and
Princeton to debate him. An aide
to Innis was quoted in Tuesday's
Daily as saying the CORE director
was "very much interested in
debating." The aide uttered
perhaps the most eloquent
summation of the whole
controversy: "We're just sorry
that academia isn't ready to
accept the concept of academic
freedom."
One would hope that the ivied
walls of Yale are ready to
withstand the challenge of
controversial ideas, even if the
minds of the "bullies" (a biracial
group) are not. But despite the
lofty references to "Yale's
principles of free speech" by one
Kingman Brewster, there runs
through this and other such
incidents, and now through that
once sapphire-strong blue of Yale,
a revolting steak of yellow.

own bid to the two men than the
university's governing body, the
Yale Corporation, and its
renowned president, Kingman
Brewster, joined the blighted
bandwagon of de facto
censorship.
Provocative Invitation
Calling the suspected second
invitation a "provocation" and
fearing "the entire community is
being used," the Yale Corporation
praised the Union for "a difficult
decision."
Brewster, long-known for an
affinity to swerve from the
traditions of his institution when
the winds of "academic thought"
are blowing counter, endorsed the
Corporation's stand and also its
half-hearted agreement not to
forbid the second organization,
Lux et Veritas, from sponsoring
the debate.
"The best way to avoid playing
into the hands of the sponsors,"
the president said in a statement,
".. . the best way to show one's
scorn and distaste for this
provocation, is to leave the
speakers to an audience of their
sponsors."
'Gracious Welcome'
How gracious a welcome to
thoughtful inquiry by the man
who once found violent anti-war

protest an excusable outgrowth of
strongly-held beliefs.
Would such a man unilaterally
shunt aside public debate of an
issue of extreme emotional
impact? Oh no, not Kingman
Brewster. "Official suppression,"
said the Yale president, "would
only dignify the occasion."
A statement by Lux et Veritas
director Thomas E. Spahn, seems
to indicate, however, that
Brewster and the Yale
Corporation jumped the gun in
their eagerness to allow/condemn
the second invitation.
"Neither .. . contacted us,"
said Spahn. ".. .No invitations to
Shockley or Innis have been
sent."
Partners-in-Crime
For purposes of argument, and
not for adopting a university
policy, let's safely assume that
such an invitation will be made.
What then? Will Yale fall by the
way of its partners-in-crime,
Harvard, Princeton, and Staten
Island Community College, and
back down at the last moment
from providing the conditions
agreed to by Shockley and Innis?
Apparently neither debator
hopes so. In fact, Shockley has
already challenged Brewster and
his fellows at Dartmouth and
Princeton to debate him. An aide
to Innis was quoted in Tuesday's
Daily as saying the CORE director
was "very much interested in
debating." The aide uttered
perhaps the most eloquent
summation of the whole
controversy: "We're just sorry
that academia isn't ready to
accept the concept of academic
freedom."
One would hope that the ivied
walls of Yale are ready to
withstand the challenge of
controversial ideas, even if the
minds of the "bullies" (a biracial
group) are not. But despite the
lofty references to "Yale's
principles of free speech" by one
Kingman Brewster, there runs
through this and other such
incidents, and now through that
once sapphire-strong blue of Yale,
a revolting steak of yellow.

Few events strike the soul as
being so repulsive as those which
depict academia in full-fledged
retreat from its promise of
intellectual freedom. We have
gotten a glimpse of academic
cowardice in action once more
this week; paradoxically, but not
surprisingly, the white flag was
hoisted in New Haven, Conn.
There, in the bastion of
unencumbered thought men were
once proud to call Yale
University, the prospect of what
Neaisweek (Dec. 17, 1973) called
"leftist bullying" caused the Yale
Political Union to rescind its
invitations to Electrical
Engineering Prof. William
Shockley and Congress of Racial
Equality director Roy Innis to
debate the former's controversial
views on genetics.
And, no sooner has the Union
canceled its welcome and a second
organization begun to consider its
own bid to the two men than the
university's governing body, the
Yale Corporation, and its
renowned president, Kingman
Brewster, joined the blighted
bandwagon of de facto
censorship.
