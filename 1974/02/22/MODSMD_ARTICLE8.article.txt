# Just For Women

There is an appalling lack of
participation by Stanford women
in the activities that exist for
them on campus. This may be
partly due to insufficient
publicity or misunderstanding of
the aims of women's groups, but
it seems to me that apathy is
largely responsible. I would like to
outline the possibilities for
participation, in order to be sure
that all those who do have any
interests beyond academics at
Stanford are aware of what is
open to them.
Here is a list that is by no
means all-inclusive, but which
gives a good idea of the wide
range of interests of Stanford
women:
1) Women in Science and
Engineering is an academically
oriented group which helps
women interested in careers in
science or engineering. Call Subba
Narashimhan at 326-8592.
Information Offered
2) Our Self-Help Clinic, which
is located at 270 Grant Ave. in
Palo Alto, teaches
self-examination and presents
information on birth control,
abortion, disease, etc.
3) The Gay Women's Union
has meetings, rap groups,
counseling and parties for gay or
bisexual women. Call 321-2300,
x 2953.
4) The Women's Recreation
Association organizes women's
intramural sports and you may
call Judy Green for information at
327-2988.
5) Consciousness-raising groups
are organized wherever several
women are interested in being in
one. Judy Chamberlain is
organizing them through the
Women's Center and can be
reached there at 321-2300,
x 3114.
CROW Lecture Series
6) The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) is sponsoring a
lecture series and trying to
develop a women's studies
program at Stanford. Call Cindy
Davis at 322-6325.
7) The Task Force on Women's
Health is organizing for the
training of peer counselors for
Cowell, and rewriting the
Contraception Handbook. Call
Ann Simons at 493-8010 or Lyse
Strnad at 326-1718.
At this time Barbara Brown is
working on a pamphlet which will
list all of the women's groups in
the area, their locations, meeting
times, and goals. It will be

available next fall, but an interim
fact sheet has been put out by
Beth Garfield and can be picked
up at the Women's Center.
Meanwhile, most of these groups
advertise in "Once Around the
Quad," and although in the past it
may not have been clear, the
meetings do welcome newcomers.
Ask Questions
So if anything looks interesting
or useful just go to the next
meeting and ask questions. Also,
the Women's Center is functioning
as a clearing house for all of these
organizations, so if you are totally
mystified by the proliferation of
advertisements elsewhere you
should call (x 3114) or drop by
(3rd floor, Clubhouse, Old Union)
and ask them to put you in touch
with the right people.
Another way to find out
what's happening with women in
the Stanford community is to
attend the International Women's
Day Fair on campus from March
6-10. Representatives from
women's political and academic
groups will be here; there will be
seminars on auto mechanics,
self-defense, arts and crafts; there
will be entertainment all day by
musicians and theatre groups; and
there will be well-known feminist
speakers throughout the five days.
Many of these organizations
and activities are feminist-oriented
in direct ways, but I certainly
hope that women are not failing
to participate because they don't
wish to become involved in radical
politics. Some of the main
concerns of these groups are to
provide women with friendships,
activity, and education that can't
be found in Stanford classes.
Benefits Political
'fhese personal benefits for
women are of course political in
their own way, since all of these
projects have flourished through
the growing consciousness of
women that they want
opportunities for self-enrichment
that only men have had in the
past. But they are here now for all
women's participation, regardless
of whether one labels oneself
radical or conservative.
So please do call the Women's
Center for information, come to
the fair, and be ready to utilize
the forthcoming pamphlet,
"Women's Guide to Stanford."
These activities are here for you.
