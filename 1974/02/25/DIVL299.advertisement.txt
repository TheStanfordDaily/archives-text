FRESHMAN SEMINAR PROPOSAL INVITATIONS FOR 1973-74
Applications to teach Freshman Seminars in 1973-74 have been mailed to all members of the
Academic Council at Stanford University. The Dean's Advisory Committee on Seminars for
Entering Students invites others in the community to submit proposals. In past years a signifi
cant contribution to the seminar program has been made by members of the Stanford community
(staff and so forth) who are not faculty members. Consideration will be given to those persons
academically qualified and having some prior experience or formal training in the particular
field in which he or she may propose a seminar.
It should be understood that restraints are put on the program for reasons of budgetary limita
tions. We wish to entertain a number of seminar proposals from a broad spectrum of teaching
disciplines and instructors, but judging from past experience not all will be accepted into the
program.
For those with particular interest in transfer students and perhaps with prior transfer student
advising experience, we ask that you consider proposing a seminar for transfers, noting this on
the application.
Proposal forms can be obtained by contacting Lynne Francis at 321-2300, ext. 3622 in Bldg. 1,
Rm. 1-C.
