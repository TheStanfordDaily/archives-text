# Overseas Chief Plans Flexible New Centers

### DON COX 
"We were rather naive in what we
thought we could accomplish but are
now surprised at what we have done,"
said Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall
reflecting back on his first year as
Overseas Studies Office director.
"The last six months have been a
lot of hard work but we've only
started," said Mancall, who has
orchestrated the efforts to overhaul
the overseas programs in the past year.
As a result, the Overseas Studies
Office plans to offei a number of new
overseas programs, starting in the next
year, in locations including Berlin,
Paris, Lima and Vienna.
Mancall took over the post of
director last spring following the
release of the "Report of the Ad Hoc
Presidential Commission For Review
Of Overseas Campuses," more
commonly known as the "Merryman
report" after the chairman of the
commission, Law Prof. John H.
"ferryman.
Programs 'Unsatisfactory'
In the report, the commission, of
which Mancall was a member, found
the foreign studies programs
"unsatisfactory," facing "declining
student interest and mounting student
disaffection" and"the object of
.ncreasing, and increasingly profound,
criticism by faculty on academic
grounds."
"The Merryman report was a point
of departure for thinking," said
Mancall. "It was not a document to be
followed but a thoughtful
consideration of the program and its
goals," he added, referring to the
report's many recommendations on
renovating the overseas programs.
"We had a solid base to build on,"
said Mancall referring to the existing
overseas program and the
recommendations of the Merryman
report. "Walker [Dr. Robert A.
Walker, former director of the
Overseas Studies Office] deserves
credit for what he did," said Mancall.
Academic Quality
One of the inadequacies of the old
overseas program that the Merryman
.eport elaborated on to a great extent
was the poor academic quality of the
programs and the mismatch between
faculty members' qualifications and
the programs in which they taught.
Mancall said that a number of steps
were being taken to rectify this
situation, including course and
teaching evaluations of overseas
courses and a closer monitoring of the
academic programs.
"We're sending faculty overseas
who are interested in pursuing their
own interests" and as a result interest
the students in the field, said Mancall.
'Marriage Of Interests'
Mancall pointed to the new
pre-med program in Britain as a
"marriage of interests" of different
faculty members.
He emphasized that "nothing will
be taught overseas that can be taught
better here."
Mancall has attempted to build as
much flexibility as possible into the
new programs. The Merryman report
recommended that the overseas
program should be "flexible in its
conceptualization, its responsiveness
to students' interests."
While "no department prevents
their majors from going overseas,"
Mancall recognized that it was difficult
for some students to find the time in
their academic schedules.

"We haven't really solved the
problem," said Mancall, but he
indicated they were working on it. He
pointed to the new pre-med program
in Britain and the future possibility of
an engineering-oriented program in
Japan as elements in the solution.
With regard to language proficiency
requirements and the new programs
Mancall said that "students ought to
have the language but if they don't it
is our job to see that they get it." This
could be done through intensive
training periods incorporated into the
calendar, he said.
One of the major philosophical
changes in the programs is the move
away from the traditional campus
model of overseas programs.
Merry man Recommendations
The Merryman report
recommended "retreating" from this
traditional approach since campuses
often became enclaves for students,
isolated from the culture of the nation

'FOOD BANK' — Several of some 1500 persons who turned out for free food in
East Palo Alto Friday wait their turn in line. Many went home empty-handed,
and others complained that the food packages they received were not worth the
$70 promised by newspaper executive Randolph A. Hearst.
in which they are located, and that the
requirements for an adequate
academic program could be "satisfied
only in major cultural centers. Our
recommendation necessarily implies
phasing out the existing campuses."
While Mancall would not comment
specifically on phasing out any
particular program, he said "every
campus will be reconsidered in terms
of the academic interests of the
program. The site will serve our
academic purposes and not vice versa."
Some observers had viewed last
quarter's decision to retain a
"residence center" in Beutelsbach as a
stop-gap measure preceeding a decision
in the next few years to abolish it
entirely. Mancall reiterated that if the
center serves the academic purposes it
will continue.
Retain Programs
History Prof. Lewis Spitz said he
hoped "both campuses and specialized
programs would be retained. Spitz said
the new programs were a "necessary
development" and a "big
improvement," but that there were
"certain values in a campus like
Beutelsbach that we really can't lose
sight of."
Associated with the move of the
programs into major cultural centers
was the recommendation by the
Merryman report that the "exclusive
location of programs in Western
Europe should be corrected."
Mancall said that the new Lima,
Peru campus was indicative of the
concern with regard to this
recommendation and that they were
exploring the possibilities of programs
in Western Africa, Japan, Jerusalem,
and Beirut.
"We have no firm plans on these
programs but student-faculty groups
are working on some of them," said

Mancall.
Merryman similarly commented
that "we've got a long way to go
before we get away from the over
heavy emphasis on Western Europe."
"The Western culture should be a
major focus, but not the only one,"
Mancall added.
Spitz said, however, that shifting
away from Western Europe "shouldn't
always remain the main concern,
though, since Europe is our history.
Clearly there is more to be gained for
an American there" since it is the
origin of much of our culture and
history."
As chairman of the committee
looking into the prospects of a

program in Jerusalem, Spitz said that a
program there would "make sense
culturally and traditionally." The
Third World effort is a good thing also
though this is a different order of
experience," Spitz said.
"We have to be aware of spreading
our resources too thin," noted Spitz.
He added, "I worry since they already
are too thin."
Spitz indicated that the Jerusalem
program might have been stalled
somewhat because of the recent
Mideast conflict. Mancall disagreed
and said that planning had only started
and that it could not possibly have
been finalized in time to start the
program in the next year.
