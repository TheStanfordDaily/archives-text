# Overseas Chief Plans Flexible New Centers

"We were rather naive in what we
thought we could accomplish but are
now surprised at what we have done,"
said Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall
reflecting back on his first year as
Overseas Studies Office director.
"The last six months have been a
lot of hard work but we've only
started," said Mancall, who has
orchestrated the efforts to overhaul
the overseas programs in the past year.
As a result, the Overseas Studies
Office plans to offei a number of new
overseas programs, starting in the next
year, in locations including Berlin,
Paris, Lima and Vienna.
Mancall took over the post of
director last spring following the
release of the "Report of the Ad Hoc
Presidential Commission For Review
Of Overseas Campuses," more
commonly known as the "Merryman
report" after the chairman of the
commission, Law Prof. John H.
"ferryman.
Programs 'Unsatisfactory'
In the report, the commission, of
which Mancall was a member, found
the foreign studies programs
"unsatisfactory," facing "declining
student interest and mounting student
disaffection" and"the object of
.ncreasing, and increasingly profound,
criticism by faculty on academic
grounds."
"The Merryman report was a point
of departure for thinking," said
Mancall. "It was not a document to be
followed but a thoughtful
consideration of the program and its
goals," he added, referring to the
report's many recommendations on
renovating the overseas programs.
"We had a solid base to build on,"
said Mancall referring to the existing
overseas program and the
recommendations of the Merryman
report. "Walker [Dr. Robert A.
Walker, former director of the
Overseas Studies Office] deserves
credit for what he did," said Mancall.
Academic Quality
One of the inadequacies of the old
overseas program that the Merryman
.eport elaborated on to a great extent
was the poor academic quality of the
programs and the mismatch between
faculty members' qualifications and
the programs in which they taught.
Mancall said that a number of steps
were being taken to rectify this
situation, including course and
teaching evaluations of overseas
courses and a closer monitoring of the
academic programs.
"We're sending faculty overseas
who are interested in pursuing their
own interests" and as a result interest
the students in the field, said Mancall.
'Marriage Of Interests'
Mancall pointed to the new
pre-med program in Britain as a
"marriage of interests" of different
faculty members.
He emphasized that "nothing will
be taught overseas that can be taught
better here."
Mancall has attempted to build as
much flexibility as possible into the
new programs. The Merryman report
recommended that the overseas
program should be "flexible in its
conceptualization, its responsiveness
to students' interests."
While "no department prevents
their majors from going overseas,"
Mancall recognized that it was difficult
for some students to find the time in
their academic schedules.

"We haven't really solved the
problem," said Mancall, but he
indicated they were working on it. He
pointed to the new pre-med program
in Britain and the future possibility of
an engineering-oriented program in
Japan as elements in the solution.
With regard to language proficiency
requirements and the new programs
Mancall said that "students ought to
have the language but if they don't it
is our job to see that they get it." This
could be done through intensive
training periods incorporated into the
calendar, he said.
One of the major philosophical
changes in the programs is the move
away from the traditional campus
model of overseas programs.
Merry man Recommendations
The Merryman report
recommended "retreating" from this
traditional approach since campuses
often became enclaves for students,
isolated from the culture of the nation

'FOOD BANK' — Several of some 1500 persons who turned out for free food in
East Palo Alto Friday wait their turn in line. Many went home empty-handed,
and others complained that the food packages they received were not worth the
$70 promised by newspaper executive Randolph A. Hearst.
