# Warren Report Distortions
## 
### 
The release of the movie Executive Action
last year, on the tenth anniversary of John
Kennedy's assassination, stimulated public
interest and renewed speculation as to the
integrity of the Warren Commission and its
findings. Polls taken shortly after its opening
indicate that well over two-thirds of the
American people believe an organized
conspiracy, not a "single, lone nut," led to
President Kennedy's murder in Dallas.
The seeds of public suspicion were planted
many years ago by the tireless efforts of
hundreds of private researchers who
uncovered the contradictions, distortions,
and outright falsehoods of the Warren
Report.
Now organized into the National
Committee to Investigate Assassinations,
they proved from scientific analysis of bullet
trajectories, photographic evidence, and
eyewitness reports that Lee Harvey Oswald —
if indeed he did shoot — was not alone.
Despite a hostile initial reception in the
American media, their message was well
publicized.
Perhaps the best known defender of the
Warren Commission is John Kaplan,
professor of law here. His famous 1967
article, "The Assassins," lambasted the
Warren Commission critics. Kaplan, however,
displays a disturbing capacity for illogic
unworthy of his considerable legal talent.
Preliminary Autopsy
Critics of the Warren Commission had
seized upon preliminary autopsy evidence,
including an FBI report, to undermine the
report's crucial conclusions bearing on
Kennedy's wounds. A second autopsy report,
however, seemed to confirm the
commission's case. Kaplan referred to this
dubious evidence to bolster his own
refutation of the critics.
But, as Kaplan himself notes, the doctors
who examined Kennedy were not

experienced forensic pathologists. Notes
taken during the initial autopsy investigation
were mysteriously bumed by the doctor who
took them. A military order prevented the
successful completion of the second autopsy.
Nor did the Commission ever examine the
X-ray or spectrographic evidence developed
at the autopsy, which it later classified. But
these considerations didn't bother Kaplan.
'Overwhelming Evidence'
Release of such evidence to investigators,
he wrote, would "accomplish very little. The
fact is that there is really no doubt as to what
those pictures will show. Entirely apart from
the photographs, the evidence that the
autopsy surgeons were correct is
overwhelming."
Prof. Kaplan must now regret his words. A
year and a half ago, the National Archives
permitted Cyril Wecht, one of the country's
leading forensic pathologists (former
president of both the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences and the American College
of Legal Medicine) to study the extent
photographic and X-ray evidence (Kennedy's
brain has mysteriously disappeared).
His report, issued in the summer, 1973
issue of Medical Trial Technique,
conclusively demonstrates the inadequacy of
the autopsy technique used on Kennedy.
Deliberate Oversight
He wrote of the doctors' methods: "To
voluntarily omit such an examination [of the
brain] is to be incompetent or a fool, and I
do not believe the autopsy pathologists were
either. I believe that they were instructed not
to do a complete examination of the brain.
The decision was not theirs." Indeed, as
Wecht proceeds to demonstrate, Kennedy's
wounds must have been caused by at least
two assassins.
Recently declassified documents from the
National Archives support Wecht's
conclusion. One, an internal memorandum

Jonathan Marshall I
from Commission attorney W.J. Liebeler,
reveals that even Commission members
realized their Report was so inadequate and
their conclusions so questionable that critics
would soon shoot them full of holes. Also
declassified are transcripts of some of the
Commission's private sessions, which show
that its members hoped to pin all the blame
on Oswald to allay the public's fears of a
conspiracy and restore confidence in the
integrity of the republic.
Unfortunately, as David Wise, author of
The Politics of Lying, points out, "10 feet, or
approximately 25,000 pages of Warren
Commission files remain closed" for 75
years. Many of these documents are FBI,
Secret Service, and CIA reports with such
intriguing titles as "Oswald's Access to U-2
Information." Unless they are declassified,
the conspirators will probably never be
caught.
Ford, Jaworski Involved
The implications of this coverup are still
unsettling. Gerald Ford, who sat on the
Commission, may soon be President. And
Leon Jaworski, now entrusted with the
investigation of the Watergate scandals, led
the Texas effort to suppress a serious
assassination investigation by state
authorities. Many other important characters
in the assassination, from Frank Sturgis and
James McCord to Arlen Specter, have
reappeared to haunt the nation with
Watergate.
Former Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst
once remakred that President Nixon's
investigation of the Watergate break-in would
be the most thorough since the Warren
Commission. The irony of his words was not
lost on those who continue to see the JFK
assassination coverup as exemplifying the
conduct of the Nixon administration.
