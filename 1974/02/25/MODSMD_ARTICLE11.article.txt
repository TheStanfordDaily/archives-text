# Women And People Of Color

A problem exists at Stanford that is
troubling — a problem of women and people
of color in affirmative action. The question is
how both causes can be addressed without
exploiting or deterring one another.
In spite of efforts to work together and
acknowledge each other's plight, problems
have arisen between non-minority females
and people of color. Last year Kenneth
Tollett, professor of high education at
Howard University, and a member of the
Carnegie Commission of Higher Education
cited the dilemma:
Minority groups, particularly blacks,
deserve better than hostility or aggressive
competition from other segments of
society — especially indefatigably
persistent and outraged middle-class white
women. Yet, the groundswell interest in
discrimination against women in higher
education is deflecting attention and
effort away from steps to correct the
more virulent form of discrimination —
that against blacks, chicanos, and Indians
Perhaps hard, cold numbers will add
reality to Professor Tollett's warning.
Stanford's affirmative action report gives an
indication what exists here. According to the
University's report for 1972-1974, published
in the Dec. 5, 1973 issue of the Campus
Report, the following facts are revealed: Of
the 863 people hired between Sept. 1, 1972
and May 31, 1973 (nine months)
—over 47 percent of them were
non-minority female alone, that is, not even
including non-minority male; whereas
—less than 22 percent of them were
minority,
—in spite of the fact that there were well
over twice as many terminations for
non-minority females than for all minorities.
In other words, there seems to be more active
hiring effort for non-minority females than
minorities.
Economic Problem
This statement reflects a misunderstanding
of the problem. The problem of people of
color is basically an economic one. Whether
voluntary or involuntary, the typical

non-minority female in this country does not
appear to be doing too poorly. The problem
of women appears to be one of breaking job
stereotypes — not breaking a hunger barrier.
The problem of people of color appears to
be a more basic — that of getting a job and
upward mobility, and I believe the national
unemployment statistics confirm this belief.
The late Dr. King saw the nation's mission to
be one of solving the problems of not only
black people, but all poor people, of any
color, sex, nationality or religion. Certainly
the poor people's march on Washington
accentuated that vision.
This is the proper system of priorities that
must be considered and undertaken if women
or people of color are to survive. Tne irony
and embarrassment of the matter is that
non-minority females worked tirelessly, and
on occasion paid with their lives, in the civil
rights movement. There must be a way they
can now work together more cooperatively.
Faculty Appointments
Faculty appointments for 1972-73 offer
no improvement. Of the 90 new faculty
appointments made, 18 were non-minority
female, but only six were of color. The
student situation probably echoes this
pattern.
The problem can not be singularly laid at
the feet of women. Part of the problem may
be how the University has and does treat
matters of color organizationally, in
comparison to matter of women. It should be
noted, for example, that the Committee on
Minority Affairs was disssolved, but the
Committee on the Education and
Employment of Women continues.
As another example, the affirmative action
report for 1973-4 includes a chart of staff
coordinators who are responsible for the
program. One could anticipate that few or
none of the managers would be of color, and
none are black or chicano. This is not to say
that the coordinators chosen are insincere or
incompetent in this task. But having no black
or chicano representatives does not appear to
be politically prudent.

There is another dimension to the
problems among people of color, and
between people of color and women, that is
critical and timely. It speaks of how the
affirmative action program is implemented
for middle and upper management jobs
where people of color or women have made
placement breakthroughs. Extra effort
should be made in important positions to
replace a minority individual with an
individual of the same group.
For example, if a Native American were a
"first" for minorities or women in a
particular management position and vacates
it, the replacement should preferably be
Native American; a woman with a woman,
and so forth. (Excluded from this discussion,
of course, would be positions that directly
relate to a group's interests. For example, the
Office of Chicano Affairs should always be
headed by a chicano.) Otherwise, colloquially
speaking, one group will conclude that other
groups are using affirmative action to "rip
off" gains it had made. This is a plan in
which the advantages are greater than the
disadvantages.
Instead of people of color and women
challenging one another on a few positions,
they could then join together in attacking
other positions within the University where
breakthroughs are yet to occur, and there
letting the best person, minority or female,
win. Such an informal policy is not being
proposed as a permanent one, but as an
interim measure toward the ultimate
achievement of equal employment
opportunity throughout the University.
There are a few vacant positions the
middle management levels within the
University that will test these thoughts in the
very near future. It's troublesome and
discouraging that women and people of color
should struggle over crumbs, to the delight of
non-supporters of affirmative action within
the University hierarchy. It is equally
troubling that such an issue has to be
discussed publicly.
