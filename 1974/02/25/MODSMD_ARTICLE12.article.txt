Opposite Opinion
Editor:
I am the mother of a Stanford
student. I have long meant to
write to tell you how much I
enjoy the Daily; with the
publication of Jean Keller's
letter (Feb. 15), bellyaching about
every article you have published
recently, I feel it is imperative to
give you my opinion, which is
exactly the opposite of Keller's.
I look forward with eager
pleasure to each issue of the
Daily. The articles and features
are almost always well-written and
well-researched. There is a nice
balance of liberal-conservative
opinion. Oliphant's cartoons are
marvelously inventive; he often
tops Herblock's.
But the most excellent thing
about the Daily is its diversity —
from the Med School's gross
anatomy labs to the Streakers. It
makes a parent feel that he is in
touch with what's going on at the
University. •
It is presumptious of Keller to
even consider pretending to be an
irate parent over the streaking
article — my two younger children
and myself had a good laugh over
the article, and took it for what it
is — a funny, mischievous, new
thing to do.
For being only a senior in
college, Keller sounds pathetically
crabby, cantankerous, humorless
and old. I can only suggest that
she no longer read her free copies
of the Daily, but subsribe to a
| newspaper such as the San Diego
Union, a cold, gray, and lifeless
sheet if ever there was one.
Meanwhile, Stanford Daily,
keep up the good journalism —
this is one parent who things
you're the greatest!

'Hearst Hysteria'
Editor:
Allow me to take issue with
the article called "Hearst
Hysteria" by Lise Giraud in the
Daily of Feb. 20. I for one am not
impressed with (1) her
presumption of military expertise
relating to our submarine
launched missile systems; (2) her
prejudicial political, racial and
socio-economic categorizations
(e.g., "Miss Hearst is white and a
member of the ruling class"); and
(3) her simplistic good guys vs.
bad guys morality to condemn
across the board our government's
foriegn programs.
More to the point, however, is
the incredible implication that
this crime might serve a useful
purpose in reminding us about our
"complicity with the filthy deeds
our government occasions." Now,
many of us will agree that the
Hearst journalistic tradition is
somewhat less than admirable, as
are the excesses of some
U.S.-supported foreign regimes.
But what has that to do with the
despicable crime of kidnapping,
whoever the victim may be?
Does the fact that the crime
was perpetrated by self-styled
revolutionary idealists (possibly in
need of extensive psychiatric
help) constitute a mitigating
circumstance? Idealists or no,
psychiatric problems or whatever,
these kidnapers have shown
themselves to be a threat to the
safety of innocent individuals.
There is some parallel, I feel, in
the revolutionary beliefs
underlying the terrorist actions of
some of the airplane hijackers
who have by now murdered many
completely innocent persons.
The Giraud article also
expresses wonderment at the
hysteria throughout the country
resulting from the kidnapping
incident. The term "hysteria" is
misleading because, although the
response has had an emotional
component, it is not characterized
by an unmanageable fear or
emotional excess (see Webster).
Perhaps one who has had more
opportunity through contact with
the people to observe their
attitudes, values and, in particular,
their compassionate reactions to
personal misfortunes with which
they can identify, would be less
surprised at the grass-roots nature
of the expressions of sympathy
and the offers of help.

Kudos To Kenrick
Editor:
I wanted to complement Chris
Kenrick on the excellent article
which appeared in the Daily on
my talk on obesity last week. It
was the first time that I had tried
to present the particular theory
which I described, and I was
delighted to see how well it had
gotten across, and was reported.
