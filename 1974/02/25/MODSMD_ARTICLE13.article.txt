# Reforms For Sicily Sought
## 
### BONITA B. RODDEN 
The "banditry of the blood
thirsty vultures" (the way the
government and the Mafia played
upon the Sicilian peasants)
appalled Danilo Dolci. In fact, he
was so horrified he abandoned his
work as an engineer and architect
in Northern Italy in order to help
reform Sicily's social structure.
Dolci, an Italian writer and
social reformer, aided by
interpreter Vieri Tucci, spoke
about Sicilian social structure in
Arroyo Lounge last Thursday.
Dolci, who is in the United
States visiting colleges, came to
Stanford as a Wilbur
Guest-in-Residence.
Uninitimidated by Mafia
threats and numerous arrests,
Dolci has crusaded against
corruption and unemployment in
Sicily since the early 19505.
Sicily's 'Gandhi'
Dolci, referred to as the
"Gandhi of Sicily," won
international acclaim in 1956 with
his "strikes in reverse." Jobless
workers in Pantinico, Sicily
protested unemployment by
working on an abandoned road
project. This led Dolci to a 50-day
imprisonment.
In 1952, Dolchi settled down
in Trappeto, Sicily, a slum area
outside of Palermo. The town had
no sewer or newspaper; and the
people were unaware of their
backwardness.
Dolci said he realized the
parasitic Mafia, the lingering
feudal structure, and the power
group's intimacy burdened the
people. The majority of the
people were unhappy, but they
made no effort to improve their
situation, he noted.
Dolci said the peasants could
not conceive of change because

they had never experienced it. In
order to improve the
technological and cultural levels
of the peasants the people needed
a community spirit.
'Patron Clients'
In Sicily, the family unit is
isolated from the rest of society,
Dolci commented. The individual
is on his own while the Mafia and
large commercial groups called
"patron clients" exchange money
and 'spaghetti' for votes and
power with the political leader,
Dolci said.
Dolci said creating new
democratic groups simultaneous
with denouncing the Mafioso
"patron-client" relationship
would solve the problem. He said
"popular analysis" needed to be
encouraged on the lowest level so
people would know where the
power was and how the votes
were accumulated.
After "popular analysis,"
people should work collectively to
solve the problem according to
Dolci. He favors communal work,
stating it gives a chance for
democratic development. He cited
building a dam communally as an
example. Through this, he said,
"People get the experience that it
is possible to change the face of
the earth."
However, if the problem is too
large to be solved by a small group
of people, Dolci professed that
the population should learn to put
pressure on various organizations
of the state.
Dolci also noted that
improving the educational system
would encourage a more
democratic society in Sicily. The
"problem of schools is as serious
as the problem of cancer," he
commented.
Dolci described a new

educational center he has
developed in Partinico. The
program consists of various
seminars for young children
brought together to contemplate
some of the essential questions of
life.
The children ask each other
questions that they have
wondered about: what is fate,
silence, progress? An adult attends
the discussions acting merely as a
mediator, not a director. He tries
to avoid manipulating the
children.
By studying the environment
and the students' individual
interests through cooperation and
dialogue, Dolci hopes the students
will develop a sense of dialectics
which will heighten their
individual development.

in Northern Italy in order to help
reform Sicily's social structure.
Dolci, an Italian writer and
social reformer, aided by
interpreter Vieri Tucci, spoke
about Sicilian social structure in
Arroyo Lounge last Thursday.
Dolci, who is in the United
States visiting colleges, came to
Stanford as a Wilbur
Guest-in-Residence.
Uninitimidated by Mafia
threats and numerous arrests,
Dolci has crusaded against
corruption and unemployment in
Sicily since the early 19505.
Sicily's 'Gandhi'
Dolci, referred to as the
"Gandhi of Sicily," won
international acclaim in 1956 with
his "strikes in reverse." Jobless
workers in Pantinico, Sicily
protested unemployment by
working on an abandoned road
project. This led Dolci to a 50-day
imprisonment.
In 1952, Dolchi settled down
in Trappeto, Sicily, a slum area
outside of Palermo. The town had
no sewer or newspaper; and the
people were unaware of their
backwardness.
Dolci said he realized the
parasitic Mafia, the lingering
feudal structure, and the power
group's intimacy burdened the
people. The majority of the
people were unhappy, but they
made no effort to improve their
situation, he noted.
Dolci said the peasants could
not conceive of change because

they had never experienced it. In
order to improve the
technological and cultural levels
of the peasants the people needed
a community spirit.
'Patron Clients'
In Sicily, the family unit is
isolated from the rest of society,
Dolci commented. The individual
is on his own while the Mafia and
large commercial groups called
"patron clients" exchange money
and 'spaghetti' for votes and
power with the political leader,
Dolci said.
Dolci said creating new
democratic groups simultaneous
with denouncing the Mafioso
"patron-client" relationship
would solve the problem. He said
"popular analysis" needed to be
encouraged on the lowest level so
people would know where the
power was and how the votes
were accumulated.
After "popular analysis,"
people should work collectively to
solve the problem according to
Dolci. He favors communal work,
stating it gives a chance for
democratic development. He cited
building a dam communally as an
example. Through this, he said,
"People get the experience that it
is possible to change the face of
the earth."
However, if the problem is too
large to be solved by a small group
of people, Dolci professed that
the population should learn to put
pressure on various organizations
of the state.
Dolci also noted that
improving the educational system
would encourage a more
democratic society in Sicily. The
"problem of schools is as serious
as the problem of cancer," he
commented.
Dolci described a new

educational center he has
developed in Partinico. The
program consists of various
seminars for young children
brought together to contemplate
some of the essential questions of
life.
The children ask each other
questions that they have
wondered about: what is fate,
silence, progress? An adult attends
the discussions acting merely as a
mediator, not a director. He tries
to avoid manipulating the
children.
By studying the environment
and the students' individual
interests through cooperation and
dialogue, Dolci hopes the students
will develop a sense of dialectics
which will heighten their
individual development.

SICILIAN 'GANDHl'—ltalian writer and social reformer Danilo Dolci,
