# Diminutive Netters Capture Top Spots

### VLAE KERSHNER 
John Whitlinger and Mark
Mitchell spent Friday and
Saturday demonstrating a proof —
the Ken Rosewall theorem, which
states that you don't have to be
tall to play great tennis.
Whitlinger beat Mitchell 7-5,
2-6, 6-1 in the sporadically
brilliant final match of the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Tournament
played on the Varsity Courts. The
pair of 5-8 sophomores put
together several amazing rallies
during their three-setter, viewed
by about 300 people.
Both players reached the finals
by defeating taller teammates in
Friday's semifinals of the
Stanford-dominated tourney, won
by the Cards for the fifth straight
year. Whitlinger came back from a
5-4 deficit, Chico Hagey (6-3)

serving, to break twice and then
coast to a 7-5, 6-1 win, while
Mitchell also completely
dominated his match against Chip
Fisher (6-3) after falling behind
0-3, finally winning 6-4, 6-2.
Doubles Champion
Fisher and Hagey didn't come
away emptyhanded. The pair of
juniors won the NorCal doubles
crowd, beating Whitlinger and
Craig Johnson 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the
finals.
For Fisher, it was his third
straight NorCal doubles title — he
won with his brother Rick as a
freshman and with Whitlinger last
year. Rumor has it that there's
already a waiting list to play with
Fisher next year.
In all, Stanford singles players
and doubles teams lost only one
match to another school, that one
coming on Friday when Jake
Warde-Tim Noonan fell to Cal's
top-seeded team of Steve
Bartlett-Steve Prouix, 6-4, 6-2.
Bartlett-Prouix was defeated 6-2,
6-4 by Whitlinger-Johnson in the
semifinals the next day. In the
other doubles semi, Hagey-Fisher
beat Steve Hahn-Carlos Aguilar, of
second-place Cal, 6-4, 6-1.
Fatigued?
Thus, Whitlinger had to play
three times Friday and three times
Saturday in reaching both the
singles and doubles finals, but the
colorful hard-hitter from Neenah,
Wisconsin, didn't let fatigue
bother him in the singles
championship.
The first set was dominated by
effective . serving from both
players. With the score knotted at
5-5, Whitlinger won three straight
points to take a 1-3 lead in the
game (15-40, for those of you
who don't like the unsubtleties of
no-ad scoring). Mitchell came
back to knot the game at 3-3, but
Whitlinger made a good forehand
return in the one-point tiebreak to
break Mitchell and then won his
own service to close out the set.
Backhand The Key
The second set was all Mitchell,
as Whitlinger lost his three straight
services with a string of
double-faults. But things were

different in the third set, as
Whitlinger's two-hand backhand
proved too much for Mitchell to
handle.
"I have a habit of doing that in
the second set," Whitlinger said
after the match. "In the third set I
thought I could get control of the
match, and I just hit hard. Mitch
is a scrapper — he's in every
point."

6-4 by Whitlinger-Johnson in the
semifinals the next day. In the
other doubles semi, Hagey-Fisher
beat Steve Hahn-Carlos Aguilar, of
second-place Cal, 6-4, 6-1.
Fatigued?
Thus, Whitlinger had to play
three times Friday and three times
Saturday in reaching both the
singles and doubles finals, but the
colorful hard-hitter from Neenah,
Wisconsin, didn't let fatigue
bother him in the singles
championship.
The first set was dominated by
effective . serving from both
players. With the score knotted at
5-5, Whitlinger won three straight
points to take a 1-3 lead in the
game (15-40, for those of you
who don't like the unsubtleties of
no-ad scoring). Mitchell came
back to knot the game at 3-3, but
Whitlinger made a good forehand
return in the one-point tiebreak to
break Mitchell and then won his
own service to close out the set.
Backhand The Key
The second set was all Mitchell,
as Whitlinger lost his three straight
services with a string of
double-faults. But things were

different in the third set, as
Whitlinger's two-hand backhand
proved too much for Mitchell to
handle.
"I have a habit of doing that in
the second set," Whitlinger said
after the match. "In the third set I
thought I could get control of the
match, and I just hit hard. Mitch
is a scrapper — he's in every
point."

NORCAL CHAMP — John Whitlinger, hitting his groundstrokes
superbly, won the Northern California Invitational tennis tournament
Saturday. Whitlinger beat Mark Mitchell 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 in Saturday's
final between the two 5-8 sophomores.
John Whitlinger and Mark
Mitchell spent Friday and
Saturday demonstrating a proof —
the Ken Rosewall theorem, which
states that you don't have to be
tall to play great tennis.
Whitlinger beat Mitchell 7-5,
2-6, 6-1 in the sporadically
brilliant final match of the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Tournament
played on the Varsity Courts. The
pair of 5-8 sophomores put
together several amazing rallies
during their three-setter, viewed
by about 300 people.
Both players reached the finals
by defeating taller teammates in
Friday's semifinals of the
Stanford-dominated tourney, won
by the Cards for the fifth straight
year. Whitlinger came back from a
5-4 deficit, Chico Hagey (6-3)

serving, to break twice and then
coast to a 7-5, 6-1 win, while
Mitchell also completely
dominated his match against Chip
Fisher (6-3) after falling behind
0-3, finally winning 6-4, 6-2.
Doubles Champion
Fisher and Hagey didn't come
away emptyhanded. The pair of
juniors won the NorCal doubles
crowd, beating Whitlinger and
Craig Johnson 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the
finals.
For Fisher, it was his third
straight NorCal doubles title — he
won with his brother Rick as a
freshman and with Whitlinger last
year. Rumor has it that there's
already a waiting list to play with
Fisher next year.
In all, Stanford singles players
and doubles teams lost only one
match to another school, that one
coming on Friday when Jake
Warde-Tim Noonan fell to Cal's
top-seeded team of Steve
Bartlett-Steve Prouix, 6-4, 6-2.
Bartlett-Prouix was defeated 6-2,
6-4 by Whitlinger-Johnson in the
semifinals the next day. In the
