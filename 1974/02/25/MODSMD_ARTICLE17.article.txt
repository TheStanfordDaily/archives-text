# Weekend Sports Highlights

Wrestling
Stanford's wrestling team won
its ninth match of the season
Friday night — a Cardinal record
for most wins in a season — when
the Cards beat arch-rival
California, 22-21.
The contest wasn't decided
until the final match, with
heavyweight Kris Westersund
coming back from a 0-3 deficit to
salvage a 3-3 draw, giving Stanford
the win.
Coach Joe DeMeo was
euphoric after the match. "Every
guy we had contributed to the
win — it was a tremendous team

effort," he said. "Everybody did
just a great job."
Stanford forfeited at 118, but
Jim Tatarakis (126) dominated
Cal's Buddy Miller, winning 14-5
to put the match at 6-3, Cal's
favor.
Charlie Masch (150) tied one
of Cal's best wrestlers 10-10 in a
wild match, and Emmett Stanton
(158) wrestling well after being
sidelined with an injury, edged his
opponent 4-3.
Roy Tolles (190) pinned his
opponent, setting the stage for
Westersund's dramatic draw.
Fresh off the big win, Stanford
went out Saturday night to even
its record, but ran into a strong
Fresno State team and lost a
close one, 24-21.
Tatarakis and Westersund
earned pins, while Mark Yancey,
Emmett Stanton and Marc Frelier
won by decisions.

Volleyball
The Stanford volleyballers had
an easy time of it Saturday night,
rolling to their first home victory
of the season, 15-10, 15-6, 15-12
over Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
Stanford dominated the match
from the outset, running off six
straight points on hits by the
Card's Jim lams and several Cal
Poly miscues.
The second game was
considerably less sloppy than the
first, but still quite boring.
Stanford, led by Willie Mannon
and George McPheeters, ran up a
9-0 lead and laughed its way to a
15-6 win.
The victory ran the Cards'
record to 2-3.
Lacrosse
The varsity lacrosse season
opened Saturday with Stanford
hosting the Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club. Though the Cardinals were
edged 6-5, they displayed an
aggressive defense and a
penetrating offense.
Stanford entered the fourth
period down 5-3, but completely
dominated the last part of the
game, though Palo Alto scored
early to increase its lead to 6-3.
Stanford responded with goals by
Craig Reynolds and Shelley
Gordon, but Palo Alto hung on
for the 6-5 victory.
Baseball
Stanford's JV baseball team
split a doubleheader with
California Saturday afternoon at
Stanford's Sunken Diamond,
winning the opener 3-2, and losing
the second game on the wrong
end of an identical 3-2 count.
Stanford's Fred Bernhardt
homered in each game.
