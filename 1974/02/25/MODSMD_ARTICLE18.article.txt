# El Paso Relays
## Spikers Win 21 Medals 
### MARK WHITE 
On a warm and pleasant Saturday in El Paso,
Tex., Stanford's track team opened the 1974
season with a promising performance, winning 21
medals in the El Paso Relays.
"We were fairly pleased," said Stanford assistant
track coach Marshall Clark. "The altitude hurt our
long distance runners a little, but we had several
personal bests, and as far as the trip as a whole
goes, it was a good start."
Double winner Dave Bagshaw was the
outstanding Cardinal participant, winning both the
120 high hurdles and the 440 intermediate hurdles.
Before the meet, Clark described the hurdling
events as "one of our real strengths," and the
performances of Bagshaw and teammate Matt
Hogsett made his words come true.
Bagshaw's 14.3 in the highs and 53.2 in the
intermediates placed him in the top seven in both
events on the all-time Stanford list. Hogsett placed
third in the intermediates at 53.2.
"We looked pretty strong in the sprints," said
Clark. "Both [Otto] Rossner and [Marvin] Holmes
looked good." Holmes won the 220 in 21.6,
equalling the time that established him as the
outstanding prep 220 sprinter in Southern
California last year. Rossner was second in both the
100 and the 220, running 10.0 and 22.3,
respectively.
Ken Curl and Scott Wingo joined Rossner and
Holmes on the 440 relay team that finished second
at 41.9, but could have done better with a little
luck. "Curl had some trouble with his legs late on
the opening leg. We almost didn't get the baton
off," said Clark. "Wingo looked good also; he had a

the event in the National AAU Indoor Meet Friday
night at Madison Square Garden.
Albritton's toss is nearly eight feet longer than
his Stanford record set when he was a freshman last|
year. He plans to return to Stanford next fall. In
the meantime, he's been invited to represent the
U.S. in a March meet against the U.S.S.R.

good afternoon."
Indeed, the freshman did well, placing in three
events. Wingo ran a 48.9 in placing second in the
quarter mile, and ran a respectable 48.6 anchor leg
in the mile relay to give the Cards another second
place medal at 3:17.8. John Kessel ran the first leg
on the relay, and finished three-tenths behind
Wingo in the quarter for a third place at 49.2.
Tony Sandoval felt some of the altitude's effects
in the three-mile, placing third in a mediocre
14:22.4. Mark McConnell finished out of the,
money in the mile at 4:15.1, but the effort was a
personal best.
Mike Hall had three lifetime bests in the jumping
events, and as a result garnered two third places.
His 6-2 in the high jump and 47-BV2 in the triple
jump earned him the thirds. Mike Royer also came
up with a personal record sling of 166-7 in the
discus for second place. Senior decathlon star Ken<
Kring placed third in the pole vault at 15 feet.

California last year. Rossner was second in both the
100 and the 220, running 10.0 and 22.3,
respectively.
Ken Curl and Scott Wingo joined Rossner and
Holmes on the 440 relay team that finished second
at 41.9, but could have done better with a little
luck. "Curl had some trouble with his legs late on
the opening leg. We almost didn't get the baton
off," said Clark. "Wingo looked good also; he had a

Albritton Hurls Shot 69%
Terry Albritton putted the shot 69% in winning
the event in the National AAU Indoor Meet Friday
night at Madison Square Garden.
Albritton's toss is nearly eight feet longer than
his Stanford record set when he was a freshman last|
year. He plans to return to Stanford next fall. In
the meantime, he's been invited to represent the
U.S. in a March meet against the U.S.S.R.

good afternoon."
Indeed, the freshman did well, placing in three
events. Wingo ran a 48.9 in placing second in the
quarter mile, and ran a respectable 48.6 anchor leg
in the mile relay to give the Cards another second
place medal at 3:17.8. John Kessel ran the first leg
on the relay, and finished three-tenths behind
Wingo in the quarter for a third place at 49.2.
Tony Sandoval felt some of the altitude's effects
in the three-mile, placing third in a mediocre
14:22.4. Mark McConnell finished out of the,
money in the mile at 4:15.1, but the effort was a
personal best.
Mike Hall had three lifetime bests in the jumping
events, and as a result garnered two third places.
His 6-2 in the high jump and 47-BV2 in the triple
jump earned him the thirds. Mike Royer also came
up with a personal record sling of 166-7 in the
discus for second place. Senior decathlon star Ken<
Kring placed third in the pole vault at 15 feet.
Stanford opens the dual meet season this Friday
at Fresno State.
On a warm and pleasant Saturday in El Paso,
Tex., Stanford's track team opened the 1974
season with a promising performance, winning 21
medals in the El Paso Relays.
"We were fairly pleased," said Stanford assistant
track coach Marshall Clark. "The altitude hurt our
long distance runners a little, but we had several
personal bests, and as far as the trip as a whole
goes, it was a good start."
Double winner Dave Bagshaw was the
outstanding Cardinal participant, winning both the
120 high hurdles and the 440 intermediate hurdles.
Before the meet, Clark described the hurdling
events as "one of our real strengths," and the
performances of Bagshaw and teammate Matt
Hogsett made his words come true.
Bagshaw's 14.3 in the highs and 53.2 in the
intermediates placed him in the top seven in both
events on the all-time Stanford list. Hogsett placed
third in the intermediates at 53.2.
"We looked pretty strong in the sprints," said
Clark. "Both [Otto] Rossner and [Marvin] Holmes
looked good." Holmes won the 220 in 21.6,
equalling the time that established him as the
outstanding prep 220 sprinter in Southern
California last year. Rossner was second in both the
100 and the 220, running 10.0 and 22.3,
