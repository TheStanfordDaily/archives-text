# Women Blast SI, Papers For 'Honeys'
## 
### 
A group of women students
and faculty criticized Sports
Information Director Bob
Murphy, the San Francisco
Chronicle, the Daily and Sports
Illustrated at a press conference
Friday for their part in the
"honey shot" controversy.
A statement read by ASSU
Vice President Beth Garfield
termed the publications' coverage
"misrepresentative, insulting and
derogatory."
The issue arose after Sports
Illustrated quoted ABC official
Andy Sidaris as saying that
"Stanford is no place for honey
shots" — television shots of
attractive female spectators.
To counter Sidaris, Murphy
released pictures he had taken at
recent athletic events. One of the
pictures appeared in the Daily;
three others wound up
prominently displayed on the
front page of the Chronicle's
Sporting Green.
Although Friday's prepared
statement chiefly concerned use
of the honey shots, most of the
press conference itself was
devoted to pointing out the
accomplishments of the women's
athletics program here, and
seeking more publicity.
Murphy himself did not show
up at the conference; he told
reporters he had adopted a
"lighthearted" approach to the
issue.
The conference may not have
had exactly the desired effect,
however. In yesterday's San Jose
Mercury-News, sports columnist
John Lindblom referred to
Garfield as "a cute — er, uh —
scholarly student body
co-president."
And the paper printed two
more of the "honey shots."
