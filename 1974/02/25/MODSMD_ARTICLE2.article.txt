# New Management Fights Deficit
## Coffee House Still Loses Money 
### CHRIS TOREM 
Despite a $34,000 face-lift last
summer and a change of management,
the Tresidder Coffee House is still
losing money — but less than last year.
Its operators are hopeful that the
break-even point will be reached by
June, 1975.
John Shaw, director of Toute de
Suite Inc. (TDS), which took over
management of the Coffee House last
year, and Coffee House Manager Ken
Brubaker are both generally pleased
with last summer's renovations.
They believe the new three-sided
counter system is more efficient than
the previous set-up, both in serving
customers and in handling food. They
cited a 30 percent increase in sales
from 1972 to 1973 as proof that the
new decor and improved lighting have
appealed to students.
Both Brubaker and Tresidder Union
General Manager Gordon Starr
attribute much of the restaurant's
improved performance to the
cost-efficiency program instituted by
Shaw. They said Shaw has worked

hard to limit the losses from food
spoilage and to organize faster service.
As a result, it is estimated that the
Coffee House processes about 1500
customers every weekday, compared
to 1100 last year.
Deficit
In addition to the Coffee House,
TDS has been running the Tresidder
Cafeteria and the Encina Snack Bar
since last fall. TDS took over the three
food services one year after Tresidder
Cafeteria's $309,000 deficit forced the
University to look for outside help.
Starr reported that the Coffee
House was $14,000 in the red for
1972. This sum included $10,000 in
overhead costs such as maintenance
and utilities, and $4000 in day-to-day
expenses such as food costs and labor.
During 1973 Starr said, Coffee
House profits exceeded everyday
expenses by $2000 and that this sum
was used to reduce 1973 overhead
costs from $12,000 to $10,000.
He said the goal for breaking
even was the end of the 1974-75
school year. "Things are going well

according to plan," he said.
Shaw explained that the Coffee
House only cleared $2000 despite
minimal campus competition because
inflation has resulted in "brutal food
cost increases" which have not been
met by item mark-ups.
"I'm reluctant to raise prices past a
certain point," he said. "But food
prices have gone up around 40 percent
in the past year."
No Compromise
Shaw said the average price per
item sold in the Coffee House was
raised by 20 to 25 percent this past
year. A liver sausage sandwich that
cost 70 cents in Jan. 1973, now costs
95 cents. Tuna sandwich prices have
soared from 65 cents to 90 cents.
Shaw said he had tried cutting costs
by buying cheaper goods, but had
been dissuaded by consumer
complaints. "The sensitivity of the
taste buds of the people nere is
amazing," he said. "Now we don't
compromise on quality."
In addition to inflation, food theft
and giveaways have hurt the Coffee
House profit margin, Shaw said. To
prevent thefts, Shaw ordered rails
installed near the counters and added
an extra cash register during peak
periods so that customers would not
become impatient and walk off before
paying.

House profits exceeded everyday
expenses by $2000 and that this sum
was used to reduce 1973 overhead
costs from $12,000 to $10,000.
He said the goal for breaking
even was the end of the 1974-75
school year. "Things are going well

according to plan," he said.
Shaw explained that the Coffee
House only cleared $2000 despite
minimal campus competition because
inflation has resulted in "brutal food
cost increases" which have not been
met by item mark-ups.
"I'm reluctant to raise prices past a
certain point," he said. "But food
prices have gone up around 40 percent
in the past year."
No Compromise
Shaw said the average price per
item sold in the Coffee House was
raised by 20 to 25 percent this past
year. A liver sausage sandwich that
cost 70 cents in Jan. 1973, now costs
95 cents. Tuna sandwich prices have
soared from 65 cents to 90 cents.
Shaw said he had tried cutting costs
by buying cheaper goods, but had
been dissuaded by consumer
complaints. "The sensitivity of the
taste buds of the people nere is
amazing," he said. "Now we don't
compromise on quality."
In addition to inflation, food theft
and giveaways have hurt the Coffee
House profit margin, Shaw said. To
prevent thefts, Shaw ordered rails
installed near the counters and added
an extra cash register during peak
periods so that customers would not
become impatient and walk off before
paying.

COFFEE COSTS — Even after a change in appearance and management last
year, the Tresidder Coffee House is still losing money, but at a slower rate. The
Coffee House is serving more people than last year, but rising food costs have
kept it in the red.
Despite a $34,000 face-lift last
summer and a change of management,
the Tresidder Coffee House is still
losing money — but less than last year.
Its operators are hopeful that the
break-even point will be reached by
June, 1975.
John Shaw, director of Toute de
Suite Inc. (TDS), which took over
management of the Coffee House last
year, and Coffee House Manager Ken
Brubaker are both generally pleased
with last summer's renovations.
They believe the new three-sided
counter system is more efficient than
the previous set-up, both in serving
customers and in handling food. They
cited a 30 percent increase in sales
from 1972 to 1973 as proof that the
new decor and improved lighting have
appealed to students.
Both Brubaker and Tresidder Union
General Manager Gordon Starr
attribute much of the restaurant's
improved performance to the
cost-efficiency program instituted by
Shaw. They said Shaw has worked

hard to limit the losses from food
spoilage and to organize faster service.
As a result, it is estimated that the
Coffee House processes about 1500
customers every weekday, compared
to 1100 last year.
Deficit
In addition to the Coffee House,
TDS has been running the Tresidder
Cafeteria and the Encina Snack Bar
since last fall. TDS took over the three
food services one year after Tresidder
Cafeteria's $309,000 deficit forced the
University to look for outside help.
Starr reported that the Coffee
House was $14,000 in the red for
1972. This sum included $10,000 in
overhead costs such as maintenance
and utilities, and $4000 in day-to-day
expenses such as food costs and labor.
During 1973 Starr said, Coffee
House profits exceeded everyday
expenses by $2000 and that this sum
was used to reduce 1973 overhead
costs from $12,000 to $10,000.
