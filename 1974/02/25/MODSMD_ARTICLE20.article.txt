# Cardinals Break Even In Wild Oregon Weekend
## Stanford Capitalizes On Late Beaver Gifts 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
COIIVALLJS, Ore. — Oregon
State coach Ralph Miller didn't
show much fatherly patience
Friday night after a Dad's Day
crowd of 9097 watched Stanford
defeat his Beavers, 55-53.
"We deserved to lose," Miller
shouted at his players. "We had
opportunities coming out of our
ears."
Opportunities like seven free
throw attempts in the final 3:44,
including a one-and-one chance
with 48 seconds left. But the
Beavers made only two of those
free throws — and one of the
misses, a shot by .776 free throw
marksman Paul Miller, barely
rippled the front of the net as it
'completed an embarrassing
downward descent.
Stanford, meanwhile,
graciously accepted the gifts.
After Miller missed another free
throw — this one grazed the rim —
with 48 seconds left, the score
was tied at 51. Then Mark Gilberg
hit Tim Patterson streaking down
the middle of the lane, and the
ensuing layup gave Stanford its
winning margin.
"It's a good thing it was a
layup," quipped Patterson. "I
couldn't hit much else tonight."
The 6-11 forward hit only 2-7
field goal attempts for the night,
but the game-winner more than
made his birthday celebration
worthwhile. (Tim turned 20
Friday.)
As a team, the Cards hit only
18 of 50 shots from the field (36
percent) and committed 29
turnovers.
"That's the hard way to win,"
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
said afterwards, "but from our
standpoint we did a great job
defensively — we had to because
we gave the ball up so damn
much."
Stanford was equally effective
in its normal variety of zone
defenses and in a man-to-man the
Cards employed whenever Miller
entered the game for the Beavers.
So despite the poor shooting and
turnovers, Dallmar had quite a bit
to smile about.
"The game was sloppy because
both teams were playing intense
basketball," he explained. "We
worked hard out there."
"Melvin Arterberry played an
outstanding game," Dallmar
added. "He had some key passes
and loose balls which don't show
up in the statistics."
The Cards jumped out to a
29-24 halftime lead and stretched
that margin to 36-28 with 18:08
remaining. But a curious
five-minute scoring drought
allowed the Beavers to close
within two points.
OSU pulled to within one at
40-39 before Arterberry scored

two straight layups to put the
Cards on top by five. The Beavers
took the lead for the first time in
the half on Rich Plante's layup
with 5:32 remaining, and from
then on the lead changed hands
four times.
With 2:09 left, Rich Kelley
sank a pair of key free throws to
tie it at 51. Miller missed three
times from the line in the next
minute-and-a-half (OSU was 7-20
for the game), and Patterson's
layup sealed the win for the
Cards.
Kelley finished with 21 points
and 11 rebounds to lead the Cards
in both categories, while Lonnie
Shelton and Plante paced the
Beavers with 11 and 10 points,
respectively.

Cardinal Notes: Oregon State's
crowd was rowdy, but statistically
less involved than its Oregon
counterpart at McArthur Court.
The first piece of debris wasn't
thrown onto the Gill Coliseum
floor until 5:18 left in the first
half, while Duck rooters littered
the gym beginning at the 7:30
mark.
Oregon State's pep band,
dressed in pajamas, engaged in a
spirited shouting war with the
LSJUMB. After a chorus line of
dancing girls was featured at
halftime, the Red Vests yelled,
"Dads: Is this why you sent your
daughters to Oregon State?"
Later, OSU responded to
Stanford's "L-e-l-a-n-d etc."
spellout with a resounding "W-h-o
C-a-r-e-s."
The Beaver fans amused
themselves before the game by
throwing beach balls and frisbees
through the stands.

UPSTAGED — Melvin Arterberry was nearly the hero Saturday night
against Oregon, but Ron Lee's 27-foot jumper with one second
remaining made 10,000 frantic Oregonians forget Arterberry's
performance. Melvin, who put Stanford ahead with a jump shot at the
:38 mark, scored 10 points against the Ducks and netted 12 the night
before against Oregon State.
