# Pac-8 Roundup
## Bruins Washed Up? Ask Northern Coaches 
### 
If you're one of those who
thinks the once mightly UCLA
Bruins are all washed up, talk to
coaches Marv Harshman and
George Raveling. John Wooden's
Bruins ran their win streak to two
last weekend with merciless
whitewashings at the expense of
the visitors from the Northwest.
Friday night UCLA snapped its
two-game losing streak with an
easy 93-68 win over WSU, and the
following evening the Bruins
stunned the shell-shocked
Huskies, 99-65, to run their
Pac-Brecord to 9-2.
All-American Keith Wilkes
scored a career high 31 points
against Washington, hitting 14-15
from the floor.
USC had no trouble with the
same foes, recording a 79-64 win
over the Huskies on Friday and an
86-59 victory over Washington
State 24 hours later.
Sophomore Bob Trowbridge, a
6-8 forward, paced the Trojans
against WSU with 25 points.
Cal had a tough time of it this
weekend, losing a pair to the
Oregon schools.
Friday night the Bears ran right
smack into Dick Harter's
Kamikaze Kids, and the result was
a hard-fought 61-54 win for
Oregon.
In the end it was seldom-used
senior Kim Swaim who spelled the
difference, and Harter denied that
it was a gesture when he put in
Swaim, who played his final
games in Mac Court this weekend.
"There's no emotion after
eight o'clock," said Harter, whose
team plays with more emotion
than any in the league. "We
needed a guy in there who would
shoot, who would step in front of
people, who would care."
Cal fared no better the next
afternoon, dropping a 77-73
decision to OSU in a regionally
televised contest at Gill Coliseum.
"I've always found," said
Beaver coach Ralph Miller, "that
Cal, for some reason or other, is
extremely difficult to put away.
And I've never been able to figure
out why."

"I've always found," said
Beaver coach Ralph Miller, "that
Cal, for some reason or other, is
extremely difficult to put away.
And I've never been able to figure
out why."

If you're one of those who
thinks the once mightly UCLA
Bruins are all washed up, talk to
coaches Marv Harshman and
George Raveling. John Wooden's
Bruins ran their win streak to two
last weekend with merciless
whitewashings at the expense of
the visitors from the Northwest.
Friday night UCLA snapped its
two-game losing streak with an
easy 93-68 win over WSU, and the
following evening the Bruins
stunned the shell-shocked
Huskies, 99-65, to run their
Pac-Brecord to 9-2.
All-American Keith Wilkes
scored a career high 31 points
against Washington, hitting 14-15
from the floor.
USC had no trouble with the
same foes, recording a 79-64 win
over the Huskies on Friday and an
86-59 victory over Washington
State 24 hours later.
Sophomore Bob Trowbridge, a
6-8 forward, paced the Trojans
against WSU with 25 points.
Cal had a tough time of it this
weekend, losing a pair to the
Oregon schools.
Friday night the Bears ran right
smack into Dick Harter's
Kamikaze Kids, and the result was
a hard-fought 61-54 win for
Oregon.
In the end it was seldom-used
senior Kim Swaim who spelled the
difference, and Harter denied that
it was a gesture when he put in
Swaim, who played his final
games in Mac Court this weekend.
"There's no emotion after
eight o'clock," said Harter, whose
team plays with more emotion
than any in the league. "We
needed a guy in there who would
shoot, who would step in front of
people, who would care."
Cal fared no better the next
afternoon, dropping a 77-73
decision to OSU in a regionally
televised contest at Gill Coliseum.
"I've always found," said
Beaver coach Ralph Miller, "that
Cal, for some reason or other, is
extremely difficult to put away.
