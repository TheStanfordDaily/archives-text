# Swimmers Triumph As New Pools Open
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
It was a long afternoon that
started with one girl and ended
with 16 men. In between,
Stanford swimmers trounced the
University of California 90-23 and
the deGuerre Pools were finally
and officially dedicated.
Synchronized swimming
champion Heidi O'Rourke started
the activities at Stanford's new
$2.2 million complex with a solo
performance. Then, after four
speeches and some 2Vi hours of
racing. Dean Anderson touched
out two Cal swimmers and
another from Stanford to win the
freestyle relay and send everyone
home happy.
Actually, this meet belongs to
the Stanford JV's. It was the last
meet of the year for many JV
swimmers, so they peaked as if it
were the championships. The JV's
won 39-36, but what was more
important were the marked
improvements made by nearly
every swimmer. The most notable
improvements were by Eric
Rasmussen, Stuart Seiff, Ralf
Haller and Kevin Cleek.
Rasmussen improved his
backstroke time by over three
seconds. Seiff dropped his 100 fly
time by three seconds and his 200
fly by five seconds. Haller
recorded lifetime bests in the 100
and 200 breaststroke while Cleek
did outstanding times in the 1000
and 500 freestyles.
Many varsity swimmers also
performed well in the annihilation
of Cal. Paul Clark swam his best
1000 in 9:54.4 and his best 200
fly in 1:55.7. Randy Whitchurch
won both the 200 individual
medley and 200 backstroke.
Randy's backstroke time of
1:56.6 set a new pool record.
John Hencken continued to
amaze the swimming world by
dropping his season's best 200
breast time to a 2:04.5.

While nearly everybody did
well, two Card sophomores stole
the show. Breaststroker Bruce
Craig qualified for the Pacific
Eight championships, by dropping
four seconds in the 200. Bruce
also improved his 100 breast time
by over three seconds. Ron
Longinotti surprised everybody
but himself by winning the 200
freestyle in 1:45.0.
The only races that Cal made
any sort of noise against the
Cardinal varsity were the 1000
freestyle and the freestyle relay.
The 1000 saw Bear Bruce Hunt
hold off Paul Clark's challenge for
Cal's only win. In the freestyle
relay, Stanford's anchorman
Anderson had to come from
behind to defeat the Bears.
This was the last dual meet for
three seniors â€” Sam Booth, Terry
Sutton and Captain Martin
Pedley. Sutton and Pedley are
going on to the Pac-8 and NCAA
championships. Booth is going on
to medical school.
So ends Stanford's dual meet
season. Jim Gaughran's swimmers
posted a 7-1 record, the only loss
coming at the hands of
second-ranked USC.
