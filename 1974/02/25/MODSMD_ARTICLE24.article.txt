# Card Pitching Fails
## Fresno State Sweeps Three 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Pitching is the name of the game in baseball. Ask
anyone. Ask Stanford baseball coach Ray Young.
He'll tell you.
"Our pitching just didn't hold up," said Young
wearily after his team dropped a three-game series
at Fresno State over the weekend. The Cards lost
19-11 Friday night then dropped two thrillers 5-4
and 201 Saturday.
Stanford, 2-8 on the season and hoping to break
a six-game losing streak, travels to San Jose
Municipal Stadium tomorrow to play San Jose
State in a 2:30 p.m. game.
Now that we've touched on the bad news, look
at some of the good news:
— Stanford's team batting average climbed to
.297. Kim Hannaford tops the team with a .429
mark. Dave Baker, who was 6 for 13 during the
series with three runs batted in, rose to .378 and
leads the team in RBl's with 11.
— Three home runs were hit by the Cardinals.
Gary Bei, the smallest man on the team at 5-7 and
145 pounds, ripped his first home run of his
collegiate career Friday afternoon. Bob Hampton
and Mark Lucich also connected.
— Pitching ace A 1 Arthur, who was shaky against
Arizona State more than a week ago, seemed to
return to normality Saturday afternoon, pitching a
two-hit shutout until he gave up two runs with two
out in the bottom of the seventh (last) inning.
Arthur is now 0-3 for the year.
"There's nothing wrong with the ball club,"
Young said. "I think the potential's there and the
ability is there but the pitchers have to realize that
they can be successful. Nobody's doing it [walking
batters] on purpose."
Young indicated that he would carry six or
seven pitchers on the squad, instead of the normal
nine or 10 that have been the corps in the past.
"We'll have four starters and two relievers. We're
not going to experiment any more. We've got a
pretty good idea about who is going to be effective
for us."
The team's attitude is good, according to Young.

"I haven't seen anybody hanging their heads. Our
spirit is not down."
In Friday's game, the Cards were leading 4-3
after three innings but the Bulldogs scored two in
the fourth to go up by one and tallied 10 times in a
disastrous fifth frame. The elapsed time for the
Bulldog half inning was 47 minutes, the longest this
year.
In the first game Saturday, the tying and
winning runs by Fresno were scored on unusual
plays. Bernie Hittner, who was relieving Max
Goldstein, wild pitched one run and balked the
winning run in. Starter Mike Williamson had
pitched well for seven innings before faltering.
"Hittner completely lost his concentration. He
had been told by the coach and by the first
baseman [Lucich] that there was nobody covering
the bag," Young said.
In the final game of the series, Arthur was
breezing along when the Bulldogs tapped out four
hits that set up the winning run, which scored when
Stanford's second baseman Joe Lamoure bobbled a
ground ball.
