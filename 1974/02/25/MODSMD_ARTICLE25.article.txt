# Lee Ignites Mac Court Crazies With Deciding Jumper At Buzzer
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
EUGENE, Ore. — A maniacal
throng of 10,000 fans screamed,
cheered and rocked McArthur
Court into a foot-stomping frenzy
Saturday night. The scoreboard
hanging from the rafters wavered
in mid-air. The foundations of the
creaky gymnasium literally shook.
And this was before the game
— before the players had even
begun their warmups. Afterwards,
after Ron Lee's 27-foot jump shot
with one second remaining had
satiated — or maybe just whetted
— the crowd's appetite, Mac Court
was a mob scene.
With seven seconds left and the
Ducks trailing 71-70, Lee
momentarily lost the ball near
mid-court. He regained possession
and glanced at the clock ("I think
I saw seven seconds," he said
later). Lee then dribbled for
position until the one-second
mark, when he fired a long
lefthander above the- menacing
hand of Melvin Arterberry.
"He was on me tough — I think
he brushed my hand. I thought
the shot might be short."
It wasn't. The ball banged
against the rim and dropped
through for a 72-71 Duck victory.
Field Goal Record
Suddenly it didn't matter that
Stanford had set a McArthur
Court record for field goal
shooting (.683), or that
Arterberry had played brilliantly
in the final minutes, scoring the
go-ahead field goal with 38
seconds remaining and then
making a crucial steal 17 seconds
later.
"Stanford played very fine
basketball," said Oregon coach
Dick Harter. "They played very
intelligently and capitalized on
our errors."
"They're a great team," Lee
added as the theme song from
Shaft blared in the jubilant Duck
locker room. "They'll be tough
next year."
Across the way, Stanford only
heard the thundering stomps of
the lingering crowd. "I was
pleased with our effort," coach
Howie Dallmar said of his scrappy
Cardinals, who played the final
5:55 without star center Rich
Kelley. Kelley fouled out at that
point on an extremely
questionable call, and was slapped
with a technical following his
justifiably angered reaction.
Tackled
"He just stepped in my path,"
Kelley said of the play that
prompted the whistle. Kelley and
Mark Barwig were both running
downcourt when "he tried to
tackle me," Kelley said.
"I have no comment about the
officiating," Dallmar fumed. "I'll
write reports later."
Besides Kelley, Tim Patterson
also fouled out, his exit coming
at 4:39. So the Cards played the
remaining minutes without their
two biggest players and still nearly
pulled off the victory, playing
hustling, inspired basketball that
would have made Knute Rockne
proud.
In all, the game was tied 10
times and the lead changed hands

25 times. Stanford led 65-61 on a
bucket by Ed Schweitzer with
5:21 to play, but Oregon tied the
score on a Stu Jackson layup two
minutes later.
A three-point play by Lee and
a 22-foot Mark Barwig jumper
offset buckets by Mike Mann and
Scott Trobbe, giving Oregon a
70-69 lead with 2:21 left.
Clutch Jumper
Arterberry put the Cards on
top with his clutch jumper at :38
and then stole the ball near
mid-court. He was fouled
immediately but missed the
one-on-one, setting the stage for
Lee's heroics.
"Lee just might be the greatest
guard I've ever seen," said Cal
coach Dick Edwards, who
attended the game as a spectator.
Lee finished with 29 points, five
assists and one awe-inspiring
rejection of an Ed Schweitzer
layup.
That block represented one of
only two missed shots for
Schweitzer, who converted 9-11
field goals and led the Cards with
22 points.
Overall, Stanford connected on
28-41 attempts from the field. It
made for a thrilling game in a
frantic atmosphere — despite the
disheartening result.
"I like playing here," Edwards
said at halftime. "It's a great
atmosphere and I don't think the
crowd really affects the players
too much. "But," he added,
foreshadowing the fateful finish,
"this place intimidates the hell
out of the officials."

Cardinal Notes: As if the
frustration of the night before
wasn't enough, the Cards arrived
on campus eight hours late
yesterday due to airline
difficulties. A scheduled 8:15 a.m.
Hughes Air West flight never left
the ground, and the team was
forced to bus to Medford to catch
a special flight at 4 p.m.
Oregon, now 8-3 in the league
and 14-9 overall, has won 10 of its
12 home games this year.
Stanford's loss dropped the Cards
to 5-6 in the Pac-8 and 11-11

Arterberry put the Cards on
top with his clutch jumper at :38
and then stole the ball near
mid-court. He was fouled
immediately but missed the
one-on-one, setting the stage for
Lee's heroics.
"Lee just might be the greatest
guard I've ever seen," said Cal
coach Dick Edwards, who
attended the game as a spectator.
Lee finished with 29 points, five
assists and one awe-inspiring
rejection of an Ed Schweitzer
layup.
That block represented one of
only two missed shots for
Schweitzer, who converted 9-11
field goals and led the Cards with
22 points.
Overall, Stanford connected on
28-41 attempts from the field. It
made for a thrilling game in a
frantic atmosphere — despite the
disheartening result.
"I like playing here," Edwards
said at halftime. "It's a great
atmosphere and I don't think the
crowd really affects the players
too much. "But," he added,
foreshadowing the fateful finish,
"this place intimidates the hell
out of the officials."

Cardinal Notes: As if the
frustration of the night before
wasn't enough, the Cards arrived
on campus eight hours late
yesterday due to airline
difficulties. A scheduled 8:15 a.m.
Hughes Air West flight never left
the ground, and the team was
forced to bus to Medford to catch
a special flight at 4 p.m.
Oregon, now 8-3 in the league
and 14-9 overall, has won 10 of its
12 home games this year.
Stanford's loss dropped the Cards
to 5-6 in the Pac-8 and 11-11
overall.
EUGENE, Ore. — A maniacal
throng of 10,000 fans screamed,
cheered and rocked McArthur
Court into a foot-stomping frenzy
Saturday night. The scoreboard
hanging from the rafters wavered
in mid-air. The foundations of the
creaky gymnasium literally shook.
And this was before the game
— before the players had even
begun their warmups. Afterwards,
after Ron Lee's 27-foot jump shot
with one second remaining had
satiated — or maybe just whetted
— the crowd's appetite, Mac Court
was a mob scene.
With seven seconds left and the
Ducks trailing 71-70, Lee
momentarily lost the ball near
mid-court. He regained possession
and glanced at the clock ("I think
I saw seven seconds," he said
later). Lee then dribbled for
position until the one-second
mark, when he fired a long
lefthander above the- menacing
hand of Melvin Arterberry.
"He was on me tough — I think
he brushed my hand. I thought
the shot might be short."
It wasn't. The ball banged
against the rim and dropped
through for a 72-71 Duck victory.
Field Goal Record
Suddenly it didn't matter that
Stanford had set a McArthur
Court record for field goal
shooting (.683), or that
Arterberry had played brilliantly
in the final minutes, scoring the
go-ahead field goal with 38
seconds remaining and then
making a crucial steal 17 seconds
later.
"Stanford played very fine
basketball," said Oregon coach
Dick Harter. "They played very
intelligently and capitalized on
our errors."
"They're a great team," Lee
added as the theme song from
Shaft blared in the jubilant Duck
locker room. "They'll be tough
next year."
Across the way, Stanford only
heard the thundering stomps of
the lingering crowd. "I was
pleased with our effort," coach
Howie Dallmar said of his scrappy
Cardinals, who played the final
5:55 without star center Rich
Kelley. Kelley fouled out at that
point on an extremely
questionable call, and was slapped
with a technical following his
justifiably angered reaction.
Tackled
"He just stepped in my path,"
Kelley said of the play that
prompted the whistle. Kelley and
Mark Barwig were both running
downcourt when "he tried to
tackle me," Kelley said.
"I have no comment about the
officiating," Dallmar fumed. "I'll
write reports later."
Besides Kelley, Tim Patterson
also fouled out, his exit coming
at 4:39. So the Cards played the
remaining minutes without their
two biggest players and still nearly
pulled off the victory, playing
hustling, inspired basketball that
would have made Knute Rockne
proud.
In all, the game was tied 10
times and the lead changed hands

25 times. Stanford led 65-61 on a
bucket by Ed Schweitzer with
5:21 to play, but Oregon tied the
score on a Stu Jackson layup two
minutes later.
A three-point play by Lee and
a 22-foot Mark Barwig jumper
offset buckets by Mike Mann and
Scott Trobbe, giving Oregon a
70-69 lead with 2:21 left.

a special flight at 4 p.m.
Oregon, now 8-3 in the league
and 14-9 overall, has won 10 of its
12 home games this year.
Stanford's loss dropped the Cards
to 5-6 in the Pac-8 and 11-11
overall.
EUGENE, Ore. — A maniacal
throng of 10,000 fans screamed,
cheered and rocked McArthur
Court into a foot-stomping frenzy
Saturday night. The scoreboard
hanging from the rafters wavered
in mid-air. The foundations of the
creaky gymnasium literally shook.
And this was before the game
— before the players had even
begun their warmups. Afterwards,
after Ron Lee's 27-foot jump shot
with one second remaining had
satiated — or maybe just whetted
— the crowd's appetite, Mac Court
was a mob scene.
With seven seconds left and the
Ducks trailing 71-70, Lee
momentarily lost the ball near
mid-court. He regained possession
and glanced at the clock ("I think
I saw seven seconds," he said
later). Lee then dribbled for
position until the one-second
mark, when he fired a long
lefthander above the- menacing
hand of Melvin Arterberry.
"He was on me tough — I think
he brushed my hand. I thought
the shot might be short."
It wasn't. The ball banged
against the rim and dropped
through for a 72-71 Duck victory.
Field Goal Record
Suddenly it didn't matter that
Stanford had set a McArthur
Court record for field goal
shooting (.683), or that
Arterberry had played brilliantly
in the final minutes, scoring the
go-ahead field goal with 38
seconds remaining and then
making a crucial steal 17 seconds
later.
"Stanford played very fine
basketball," said Oregon coach
Dick Harter. "They played very
intelligently and capitalized on
our errors."
"They're a great team," Lee
added as the theme song from
Shaft blared in the jubilant Duck
locker room. "They'll be tough
next year."
Across the way, Stanford only
heard the thundering stomps of
the lingering crowd. "I was
pleased with our effort," coach
Howie Dallmar said of his scrappy
Cardinals, who played the final
5:55 without star center Rich
Kelley. Kelley fouled out at that
point on an extremely
questionable call, and was slapped
with a technical following his
justifiably angered reaction.
Tackled
"He just stepped in my path,"
Kelley said of the play that
prompted the whistle. Kelley and
Mark Barwig were both running
downcourt when "he tried to
tackle me," Kelley said.
"I have no comment about the
officiating," Dallmar fumed. "I'll
write reports later."
Besides Kelley, Tim Patterson
also fouled out, his exit coming
at 4:39. So the Cards played the
remaining minutes without their
two biggest players and still nearly
pulled off the victory, playing
hustling, inspired basketball that
would have made Knute Rockne
proud.
In all, the game was tied 10
times and the lead changed hands

25 times. Stanford led 65-61 on a
bucket by Ed Schweitzer with
5:21 to play, but Oregon tied the
score on a Stu Jackson layup two
minutes later.
A three-point play by Lee and
a 22-foot Mark Barwig jumper
offset buckets by Mike Mann and
Scott Trobbe, giving Oregon a
70-69 lead with 2:21 left.
Clutch Jumper
Arterberry put the Cards on
top with his clutch jumper at :38
and then stole the ball near
mid-court. He was fouled
immediately but missed the
one-on-one, setting the stage for
Lee's heroics.
"Lee just might be the greatest
guard I've ever seen," said Cal
coach Dick Edwards, who
attended the game as a spectator.
Lee finished with 29 points, five
assists and one awe-inspiring
rejection of an Ed Schweitzer
layup.
That block represented one of
only two missed shots for
Schweitzer, who converted 9-11
field goals and led the Cards with
22 points.
Overall, Stanford connected on
28-41 attempts from the field. It
made for a thrilling game in a
frantic atmosphere — despite the
disheartening result.
"I like playing here," Edwards
said at halftime. "It's a great
atmosphere and I don't think the
crowd really affects the players
too much. "But," he added,
foreshadowing the fateful finish,
"this place intimidates the hell
out of the officials."

score on a Stu Jackson layup two
minutes later.
A three-point play by Lee and
a 22-foot Mark Barwig jumper
offset buckets by Mike Mann and
Scott Trobbe, giving Oregon a
70-69 lead with 2:21 left.
Clutch Jumper
Arterberry put the Cards on
top with his clutch jumper at :38
and then stole the ball near
mid-court. He was fouled
immediately but missed the
one-on-one, setting the stage for
Lee's heroics.
"Lee just might be the greatest
guard I've ever seen," said Cal
coach Dick Edwards, who
attended the game as a spectator.
Lee finished with 29 points, five
assists and one awe-inspiring
rejection of an Ed Schweitzer
layup.
That block represented one of
only two missed shots for
Schweitzer, who converted 9-11
field goals and led the Cards with
22 points.
Overall, Stanford connected on
28-41 attempts from the field. It
made for a thrilling game in a
frantic atmosphere — despite the
disheartening result.
"I like playing here," Edwards
said at halftime. "It's a great
atmosphere and I don't think the
crowd really affects the players
too much. "But," he added,
foreshadowing the fateful finish,
"this place intimidates the hell
out of the officials."

Cardinal Notes: As if the
frustration of the night before
wasn't enough, the Cards arrived
on campus eight hours late
yesterday due to airline
difficulties. A scheduled 8:15 a.m.
Hughes Air West flight never left
the ground, and the team was
forced to bus to Medford to catch
a special flight at 4 p.m.
Oregon, now 8-3 in the league
and 14-9 overall, has won 10 of its
12 home games this year.
Stanford's loss dropped the Cards
to 5-6 in the Pac-8 and 11-11
overall.
EUGENE, Ore. — A maniacal
throng of 10,000 fans screamed,
cheered and rocked McArthur
Court into a foot-stomping frenzy
Saturday night. The scoreboard
hanging from the rafters wavered
in mid-air. The foundations of the
creaky gymnasium literally shook.
And this was before the game
— before the players had even
begun their warmups. Afterwards,
after Ron Lee's 27-foot jump shot
with one second remaining had
satiated — or maybe just whetted
— the crowd's appetite, Mac Court
was a mob scene.
With seven seconds left and the
Ducks trailing 71-70, Lee
momentarily lost the ball near
mid-court. He regained possession
and glanced at the clock ("I think
I saw seven seconds," he said
later). Lee then dribbled for
position until the one-second
mark, when he fired a long
lefthander above the- menacing
hand of Melvin Arterberry.
"He was on me tough — I think
he brushed my hand. I thought
the shot might be short."
It wasn't. The ball banged
against the rim and dropped
through for a 72-71 Duck victory.
Field Goal Record
Suddenly it didn't matter that
Stanford had set a McArthur
Court record for field goal
shooting (.683), or that
Arterberry had played brilliantly
in the final minutes, scoring the
go-ahead field goal with 38
seconds remaining and then
making a crucial steal 17 seconds
later.
"Stanford played very fine
basketball," said Oregon coach
Dick Harter. "They played very
intelligently and capitalized on
our errors."
"They're a great team," Lee
added as the theme song from
Shaft blared in the jubilant Duck
locker room. "They'll be tough
next year."
Across the way, Stanford only
heard the thundering stomps of
the lingering crowd. "I was
pleased with our effort," coach
Howie Dallmar said of his scrappy
Cardinals, who played the final
5:55 without star center Rich
Kelley. Kelley fouled out at that
point on an extremely
questionable call, and was slapped
with a technical following his
justifiably angered reaction.
Tackled
"He just stepped in my path,"
Kelley said of the play that
prompted the whistle. Kelley and
Mark Barwig were both running
downcourt when "he tried to
tackle me," Kelley said.
"I have no comment about the
officiating," Dallmar fumed. "I'll
write reports later."
Besides Kelley, Tim Patterson
also fouled out, his exit coming
at 4:39. So the Cards played the
remaining minutes without their
two biggest players and still nearly
pulled off the victory, playing
hustling, inspired basketball that
would have made Knute Rockne
proud.
In all, the game was tied 10
times and the lead changed hands

25 times. Stanford led 65-61 on a
bucket by Ed Schweitzer with
5:21 to play, but Oregon tied the
score on a Stu Jackson layup two
minutes later.
A three-point play by Lee and
a 22-foot Mark Barwig jumper
offset buckets by Mike Mann and
Scott Trobbe, giving Oregon a
70-69 lead with 2:21 left.
