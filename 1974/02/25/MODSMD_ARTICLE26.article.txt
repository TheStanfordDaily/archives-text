# JV Winning Streak Reaches Six Games
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Completing a dramatic display
of their season-long improvement,
the Stanford junior varsity cagers
defeated the San Jose State JV,
72-67, Saturday night at San Jose
Civic Auditorium.
The win, Stanford's sixth in a
row, improved the Cards' record
to 9-5 and avenged an earlier
76-71 loss to the Spartans.
Thursday night's victory over the
Santa Clara JV, 76-57, balanced a
previous defeat to the Broncos.
"We had control of the game
the whole way — we just couldn't
blow 'em out," said Cardinal
coach Billy Jones of Saturday's
win. The reason for Stanford's
inabili-ty to run away with the
contest, Jones said, was "the
worst officiating I've ever seen.
We had four or five baskets taken
away."
Jones wasn't naming names,
but said one of the pair of refs
was "decent" and the other "gave
us the shaft."
"We beat them by more than
five points — I'm sure about
that," said Jones in analyzing the
officials' effect on the game.
Stanford led by two at the half
and San Jose was still close with
seven minutes left, Jones said, but

the Card lead was "never any less
than five" the rest of the way.
Major responsibility for the
"upset" win over the Spartans lay
in the hands of varsity import
Rich Wohlstadter, who scored 19
points and collected 12 rebounds.
His part in the carom war was
particularly important because
Card center Scott Russell was lost
with four fouls most of the
second half.
Guard Terry McCartin scored
14 points and Sven Walker added
13 with nine rebounds to aid the
Cardinal cause.
Spartans Grady Roberts and
Rick Younge, who scored 43
points between them in San Jose's
earlier victory over Stanford, were
limited to 17 and 12, respectively,
Saturday.
Wohlstadter played with the
JV for both games this weekend
in place of the team's leading
scorer, Marty Moroski, who
traveled with the varsity to
Oregon.
"Richard was rebounding a lot
more. Marty tends to break the
ball loose a lot," Jones said in
comparing the two stars. "I'd say
there's a very thin line [of
difference] in rebounding."
Point-wise, Wohlstadter's efforts
(11 Thursday night) were up with
Moroski's par.
Jones said Stanford won
Saturday's battle because "we
outsmarted 'em," but the triumph
seemed more a continuation of
the hot-streak the JV has been on
for a month and a half. Indeed,
observers are beginning to wonder
if this JV, seemingly destined at
season's start to go winless, ever
will lose again.
"We're a good ball club," Jones
continues to stress. "They work
hard, and things are starting to
pay off."
So the Cards, who exploded in
the second half for their win
Thursday night, go into the
season's final three games with a
good chance to win as many
games as the Stanford varsity.
