Kissinger Begins New Negotiations
WASHINGTON — In his new tour of the Middle East,
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger intends to confer
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat about extending the
life of the United Nations peace-keeping force in the Sinai
Peninsula.
Kissinger's main task, as he heads out today, is to bring
Syria and Israel together to negotiate a disengagement of
their armies in the Golan Heights.
Sadat, in Lahore, Pakistan, winding up a two-day visit to
the Islamic summit, was optimistic yesterday about
Kissinger's mission and said disengagement on the Syrian
front "will be a very good step" toward lifting the Arab oil
embargo against the United States.
The summit on Saturday condemned the United States
and other nations that support Israel. It also demanded
major concessions from Israel, including unconditional
withdrawal from occupied territories and the restoration of
Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty.
Kissinger's effort to keep the U.N. contingent in place
between Egyptian and Israeli troops also is a key to keeping
the peace in the Middle East.
The U.N. force was authorized for only six months. This
ends on April 27. It would take a follow-up positive step by
the Security Council to keep the force in the buffer zone.
Simon Repeats Opposition To Rationing
WASHINGTON — Federal energy chief William E.
Simon said yesterday that if motorists were lined up on a
widespread basis for two to three hours outside service
stations to buy gasoline, "it would become necessary for
me to recommend rationing."
But Simon stressed in a broadcast interview that he
believes the three-week-old gasoline-allocation program will
end the "suffering and hardship and inconvenience." He
repeated his opposition to coupon rationing.
Problems of instrastate distribution of gasoline have
made long lines and closed stations a driving characteristic
mainly in urban centers, he said on NBC's "Meet the Press"
program.
Simon acknowledged that the allocation program has
inequities that will require time for resolution.
On Saturday, Simon announced that 90 percent of the
nation's'stations may raise prices this Friday by an extra
two cents a gallon.
He called the boost "a modest increase" as opposed to
the "unmanageable" one operators sought.
Hearst Waits For SLA Reaction
HILLSBOROUGH — Three weeks ago tonight Patricia
Hearst was dragged from her apartment by kidnapers.
Yesterday, the Hearst family waited for word from the
terrorists on whether they would release their captive in
exchange for a pledge of another $4 million in food for the
poor.
The organizers of a $2 million food program already set
up worked to improve distribution techniques. They said
there would be more volunteers and more distribution
centers when the giveaway resumes tomorrow.
"A great many mistakes were made Friday," said A.
Ludlow Kramer, Washington secretary of state who
organized the program known as People in Need. "But they
were mistakes we had to take a chance on, because we had
a commitment."

Kramer referred to violence and confusion at several of
the four distribution centers.
Close Finish Seen For British Election
LONDON — Insiders of both the ruling Conservative and
opposition Labor parties are forecasting a photo finish in
Thursday's general elections.
There are suggestions too, that moderate Liberals under
Jeromy Thorpe will realize their old dreams of a
power-balancing role if Prime Minister Edward Heath and
Labor party leader Harold Wilson fail to achieve an over-all
margin of House of Commons seats.
Most of the public opinion polls, some owned by
pre-Conservative newspapers, make Heath the frontrunner.
Most of them were proven wrong in 1970 when Heath
snatched a stunning victory from Wilson against all odds.
But Heath is facing a mini-rebellion within his own
party. Conservative maverick Enoch Powell hinted Saturday
that Britons should vote for Labor as the only way to
retain their sovereignty in the Common Market. Labor is
pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain's market
membership if it wins the elections.
Atlanta Kidnap Suspects Held
ATLANTA — The two accused abductors of Atlanta
Constitution Editor Reg Murphy were being held in
maximum security yesterday.
Asst. U.S. Atty. William Gaffney said, "At this time I
know of no reason to conclude that there were more than
two people involved."
Murphy, who positively identified William A.H. Williams
as his captor from photographs, said during his captivity the
man told him three other men and a woman were also
involved.
The group purported to represent the hitherto unknown
"American Revolutionary Army," whose existence is now
being questioned.
The 40-year-old editor said Saturday he is sure there
were two persons, a man and woman, but isn't sure if more
were involved.
No Motive Found In Knowland Death
GUERNEVILLE — Sheriff's investigators said Sunday
no motive had been uncovered for the death of former U.S.
Sen. William F. Knowland, editor and publisher of the
Oakland Tribune. Knowland died of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound, authorities said.
Divers pulled the body of the 65-year-old news executive
from the Russian River late Saturday afternoon, a sheriff's
investigator said.
A ,32-caliber pistol was also reported recovered from the
waters of the river behind Knowland's $150,000 summer
home near Monte Rio, about 75 miles north of San
Francisco.
"We have definitely ruled out foul play. Knowland died
of a self-inflicted bullet wound," said Undersheriff Robert
Hayes, spokesman for Sheriff-Coroner Don Striepeke.
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow, with chance of rain in the afternoon. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs both days in mid
50s to mid 60s.

no motive had been uncovered for the death of former U.S.
Sen. William F. Knowland, editor and publisher of the
Oakland Tribune. Knowland died of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound, authorities said.
Divers pulled the body of the 65-year-old news executive
from the Russian River late Saturday afternoon, a sheriff's
investigator said.
A ,32-caliber pistol was also reported recovered from the
waters of the river behind Knowland's $150,000 summer
home near Monte Rio, about 75 miles north of San
Francisco.
"We have definitely ruled out foul play. Knowland died
of a self-inflicted bullet wound," said Undersheriff Robert
Hayes, spokesman for Sheriff-Coroner Don Striepeke.
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow, with chance of rain in the afternoon. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs both days in mid
50s to mid 60s.
Kissinger Begins New Negotiations
WASHINGTON — In his new tour of the Middle East,
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger intends to confer
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat about extending the
life of the United Nations peace-keeping force in the Sinai
Peninsula.
Kissinger's main task, as he heads out today, is to bring
Syria and Israel together to negotiate a disengagement of
their armies in the Golan Heights.
Sadat, in Lahore, Pakistan, winding up a two-day visit to
the Islamic summit, was optimistic yesterday about
Kissinger's mission and said disengagement on the Syrian
front "will be a very good step" toward lifting the Arab oil
embargo against the United States.
The summit on Saturday condemned the United States
and other nations that support Israel. It also demanded
major concessions from Israel, including unconditional
withdrawal from occupied territories and the restoration of
Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty.
Kissinger's effort to keep the U.N. contingent in place
between Egyptian and Israeli troops also is a key to keeping
the peace in the Middle East.
The U.N. force was authorized for only six months. This
ends on April 27. It would take a follow-up positive step by
the Security Council to keep the force in the buffer zone.
Simon Repeats Opposition To Rationing
WASHINGTON — Federal energy chief William E.
Simon said yesterday that if motorists were lined up on a
widespread basis for two to three hours outside service
stations to buy gasoline, "it would become necessary for
me to recommend rationing."
But Simon stressed in a broadcast interview that he
believes the three-week-old gasoline-allocation program will
end the "suffering and hardship and inconvenience." He
repeated his opposition to coupon rationing.
Problems of instrastate distribution of gasoline have
made long lines and closed stations a driving characteristic
mainly in urban centers, he said on NBC's "Meet the Press"
program.
Simon acknowledged that the allocation program has
inequities that will require time for resolution.
On Saturday, Simon announced that 90 percent of the
nation's'stations may raise prices this Friday by an extra
two cents a gallon.
He called the boost "a modest increase" as opposed to
the "unmanageable" one operators sought.
Hearst Waits For SLA Reaction
HILLSBOROUGH — Three weeks ago tonight Patricia
Hearst was dragged from her apartment by kidnapers.
Yesterday, the Hearst family waited for word from the
terrorists on whether they would release their captive in
exchange for a pledge of another $4 million in food for the
poor.
The organizers of a $2 million food program already set
up worked to improve distribution techniques. They said
there would be more volunteers and more distribution
centers when the giveaway resumes tomorrow.
"A great many mistakes were made Friday," said A.
Ludlow Kramer, Washington secretary of state who
organized the program known as People in Need. "But they
were mistakes we had to take a chance on, because we had
a commitment."

Kramer referred to violence and confusion at several of
the four distribution centers.
Close Finish Seen For British Election
LONDON — Insiders of both the ruling Conservative and
opposition Labor parties are forecasting a photo finish in
Thursday's general elections.
There are suggestions too, that moderate Liberals under
Jeromy Thorpe will realize their old dreams of a
power-balancing role if Prime Minister Edward Heath and
Labor party leader Harold Wilson fail to achieve an over-all
margin of House of Commons seats.
Most of the public opinion polls, some owned by
pre-Conservative newspapers, make Heath the frontrunner.
Most of them were proven wrong in 1970 when Heath
snatched a stunning victory from Wilson against all odds.
But Heath is facing a mini-rebellion within his own
party. Conservative maverick Enoch Powell hinted Saturday
that Britons should vote for Labor as the only way to
retain their sovereignty in the Common Market. Labor is
pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain's market
membership if it wins the elections.
Atlanta Kidnap Suspects Held
ATLANTA — The two accused abductors of Atlanta
Constitution Editor Reg Murphy were being held in
maximum security yesterday.
Asst. U.S. Atty. William Gaffney said, "At this time I
know of no reason to conclude that there were more than
two people involved."
Murphy, who positively identified William A.H. Williams
as his captor from photographs, said during his captivity the
man told him three other men and a woman were also
involved.
The group purported to represent the hitherto unknown
"American Revolutionary Army," whose existence is now
being questioned.
The 40-year-old editor said Saturday he is sure there
were two persons, a man and woman, but isn't sure if more
were involved.

party. Conservative maverick Enoch Powell hinted Saturday
that Britons should vote for Labor as the only way to
retain their sovereignty in the Common Market. Labor is
pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain's market
membership if it wins the elections.
Atlanta Kidnap Suspects Held
ATLANTA — The two accused abductors of Atlanta
Constitution Editor Reg Murphy were being held in
maximum security yesterday.
Asst. U.S. Atty. William Gaffney said, "At this time I
know of no reason to conclude that there were more than
two people involved."
Murphy, who positively identified William A.H. Williams
as his captor from photographs, said during his captivity the
man told him three other men and a woman were also
involved.
The group purported to represent the hitherto unknown
"American Revolutionary Army," whose existence is now
being questioned.
The 40-year-old editor said Saturday he is sure there
were two persons, a man and woman, but isn't sure if more
were involved.
No Motive Found In Knowland Death
GUERNEVILLE — Sheriff's investigators said Sunday
no motive had been uncovered for the death of former U.S.
Sen. William F. Knowland, editor and publisher of the
Oakland Tribune. Knowland died of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound, authorities said.
Divers pulled the body of the 65-year-old news executive
from the Russian River late Saturday afternoon, a sheriff's
investigator said.
A ,32-caliber pistol was also reported recovered from the
waters of the river behind Knowland's $150,000 summer
home near Monte Rio, about 75 miles north of San
Francisco.
"We have definitely ruled out foul play. Knowland died
of a self-inflicted bullet wound," said Undersheriff Robert
Hayes, spokesman for Sheriff-Coroner Don Striepeke.
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow, with chance of rain in the afternoon. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs both days in mid
50s to mid 60s.
Kissinger Begins New Negotiations
WASHINGTON — In his new tour of the Middle East,
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger intends to confer
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat about extending the
life of the United Nations peace-keeping force in the Sinai
Peninsula.
Kissinger's main task, as he heads out today, is to bring
Syria and Israel together to negotiate a disengagement of
their armies in the Golan Heights.
Sadat, in Lahore, Pakistan, winding up a two-day visit to
the Islamic summit, was optimistic yesterday about
Kissinger's mission and said disengagement on the Syrian
front "will be a very good step" toward lifting the Arab oil
embargo against the United States.
The summit on Saturday condemned the United States
and other nations that support Israel. It also demanded
major concessions from Israel, including unconditional
withdrawal from occupied territories and the restoration of
Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty.
Kissinger's effort to keep the U.N. contingent in place
between Egyptian and Israeli troops also is a key to keeping
the peace in the Middle East.
The U.N. force was authorized for only six months. This
ends on April 27. It would take a follow-up positive step by
the Security Council to keep the force in the buffer zone.
Simon Repeats Opposition To Rationing
WASHINGTON — Federal energy chief William E.
Simon said yesterday that if motorists were lined up on a
widespread basis for two to three hours outside service
stations to buy gasoline, "it would become necessary for
me to recommend rationing."
But Simon stressed in a broadcast interview that he
believes the three-week-old gasoline-allocation program will
end the "suffering and hardship and inconvenience." He
repeated his opposition to coupon rationing.
Problems of instrastate distribution of gasoline have
made long lines and closed stations a driving characteristic
mainly in urban centers, he said on NBC's "Meet the Press"
program.
Simon acknowledged that the allocation program has
inequities that will require time for resolution.
On Saturday, Simon announced that 90 percent of the
nation's'stations may raise prices this Friday by an extra
two cents a gallon.
He called the boost "a modest increase" as opposed to
the "unmanageable" one operators sought.
Hearst Waits For SLA Reaction
HILLSBOROUGH — Three weeks ago tonight Patricia
Hearst was dragged from her apartment by kidnapers.
Yesterday, the Hearst family waited for word from the
terrorists on whether they would release their captive in
exchange for a pledge of another $4 million in food for the
poor.
The organizers of a $2 million food program already set
up worked to improve distribution techniques. They said
there would be more volunteers and more distribution
centers when the giveaway resumes tomorrow.
"A great many mistakes were made Friday," said A.
Ludlow Kramer, Washington secretary of state who
organized the program known as People in Need. "But they
were mistakes we had to take a chance on, because we had
a commitment."

Kramer referred to violence and confusion at several of
the four distribution centers.
Close Finish Seen For British Election
LONDON — Insiders of both the ruling Conservative and
opposition Labor parties are forecasting a photo finish in
Thursday's general elections.
There are suggestions too, that moderate Liberals under
Jeromy Thorpe will realize their old dreams of a
power-balancing role if Prime Minister Edward Heath and
Labor party leader Harold Wilson fail to achieve an over-all
margin of House of Commons seats.
Most of the public opinion polls, some owned by
pre-Conservative newspapers, make Heath the frontrunner.
Most of them were proven wrong in 1970 when Heath
snatched a stunning victory from Wilson against all odds.
But Heath is facing a mini-rebellion within his own
party. Conservative maverick Enoch Powell hinted Saturday
that Britons should vote for Labor as the only way to
retain their sovereignty in the Common Market. Labor is
pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain's market
membership if it wins the elections.
