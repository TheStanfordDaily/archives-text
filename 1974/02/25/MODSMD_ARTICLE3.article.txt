# Lonely Bat Finds UGLY Perch
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A bat is currently residing on the fourth level of Meyer
Library (UGLY), and its movements caused consternation
among students Saturday night.
'The bat swooped down at people and several students
hid underneath their carrels," according to Caroline
Gatewood, student worker in the library. "It was not
causing any trouble until someone saw the bat and started
throwing things at it."
Bats have sometimes flown into Meyer Library,
explained Hal Wilson, University safety and health
specialist. Although a few rapid bats were captured on
campus early in 1973, none of the bats that have appeared
recently in Meyer has carried rabies.
Gatewood claimed that library and University officials
refused to do anything about the bat. Doros Meadows,
night supervisor of the library Saturday, agreed with her.
Bats Bite?
"I suggested that the library be cleared of students, but
the library administration didn't think that the problem
was serious enough to do that," Meadows stated. "But I
didn't want to work there and I do not believe that
students should have to study in a place where there is a
danger of being bitten by a bat."
Gatewood noted that the Santa Clara County Health
Department and the Department of Police Services were
contacted when the bat was first noticed last Wednesday.
Neither agency was able to propose a way to rid the library
of the bat, Gatewood stated.
"It would be a physical impossibility to catch the bat,"
Wilson explained. "It absolutely cannot be caught."

Wilson noted that he once went into Meyer with a net
and tried to capture a bat, but it was out of reach, perched
in a rafter.
Wilson said that bats carrying rabies usually die rather
quickly, and therefore, if this bat has been in the library
since Wednesday, it probably is not rabid.
He emphasized that the chances of the Meyer Library
bat attacking anyone are nil. "Bats avoid people," he said.
"The only way it would ever bite anyone would be if
someone attacked it."
Screen Open Spaces
An unknown number of bats live in the attic of Meyer
Library, Wilson said. He recently suggested that the open
spaces of the attic be closed off with screens.
"I have been told by several experts that it would be sad
to exterminate the bats," Wilson said. "They usually are
good for the environment because they eat insects. Since
they are no threat to the people of Stanford, there is no
reason to kill them."
The bat in the Meyer Library apparently entered the
building from one of the openings on the fourth floor
window balcony, according to Meadows. Library
administrators will meet this week to discuss the possibility
of placing screens over those openings, she said.
"Students should be made aware of the danger of the
bats," Gatewood said. She added that she is frightened of
bats, having been bitten by one in Panama several years ago.
"I was told that the bat [in Meyer] would eventually
starve to death," she said. "But I don't believe that the
school should wait that long to get rid of the bat."

specialist. Although a few rapid bats were captured on
campus early in 1973, none of the bats that have appeared
recently in Meyer has carried rabies.
Gatewood claimed that library and University officials
refused to do anything about the bat. Doros Meadows,
night supervisor of the library Saturday, agreed with her.
Bats Bite?
"I suggested that the library be cleared of students, but
the library administration didn't think that the problem
was serious enough to do that," Meadows stated. "But I
didn't want to work there and I do not believe that
students should have to study in a place where there is a
danger of being bitten by a bat."
Gatewood noted that the Santa Clara County Health
Department and the Department of Police Services were
contacted when the bat was first noticed last Wednesday.
Neither agency was able to propose a way to rid the library
of the bat, Gatewood stated.
"It would be a physical impossibility to catch the bat,"
Wilson explained. "It absolutely cannot be caught."

Wilson noted that he once went into Meyer with a net
and tried to capture a bat, but it was out of reach, perched
in a rafter.
Wilson said that bats carrying rabies usually die rather
quickly, and therefore, if this bat has been in the library
since Wednesday, it probably is not rabid.
He emphasized that the chances of the Meyer Library
bat attacking anyone are nil. "Bats avoid people," he said.
"The only way it would ever bite anyone would be if
someone attacked it."
Screen Open Spaces
An unknown number of bats live in the attic of Meyer
Library, Wilson said. He recently suggested that the open
spaces of the attic be closed off with screens.
"I have been told by several experts that it would be sad
to exterminate the bats," Wilson said. "They usually are
good for the environment because they eat insects. Since
they are no threat to the people of Stanford, there is no
reason to kill them."
The bat in the Meyer Library apparently entered the
building from one of the openings on the fourth floor
window balcony, according to Meadows. Library
administrators will meet this week to discuss the possibility
of placing screens over those openings, she said.
"Students should be made aware of the danger of the
bats," Gatewood said. She added that she is frightened of
bats, having been bitten by one in Panama several years ago.
"I was told that the bat [in Meyer] would eventually
starve to death," she said. "But I don't believe that the
school should wait that long to get rid of the bat."
A bat is currently residing on the fourth level of Meyer
Library (UGLY), and its movements caused consternation
among students Saturday night.
'The bat swooped down at people and several students
hid underneath their carrels," according to Caroline
Gatewood, student worker in the library. "It was not
causing any trouble until someone saw the bat and started
throwing things at it."
Bats have sometimes flown into Meyer Library,
explained Hal Wilson, University safety and health
specialist. Although a few rapid bats were captured on
campus early in 1973, none of the bats that have appeared
recently in Meyer has carried rabies.
