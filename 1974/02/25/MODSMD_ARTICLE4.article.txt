# Crowd Displeased By Food Giveaway
## 
### KATHY BRADY DOYLE McMANUS 
Some 1500 persons turned out for
free food in East Palo Alto Friday in
the first chaotic day of the People in
Need program.
Many of them went home
empty-handed.
The program's "food bank," held in
the vacant Dumbarton Inn restaurant
at University Avenue and Bay Road,
opened just after noon — and ran out
of food two hours later.
The distribution was the first effort
of a $2 million program organized by
newspaper executive Randolph A.
Hearst as a "goodwill gesture" to the
Symbionese Liberation Army,
kidnapers of his daughter Patricia.
'Ain't No $70'
Over 1000 persons, many of whom
had waited since early morning,
received prepackaged boxes of
groceries from Nairobi College
volunteers. The boxes included tea,
tomato juice, frozen chicken, turkey
legs, canned meat, and crackers.
"That little bitty amount of food
ain't no $70 worth," one volunteer
worker said.
Most of those who received boxes
estimated that the contents were
worth closer to $10, and expressed
resentment at getting less than
expected.
Orderly Crowd
There were a few, small scuffles
over bags and boxes when the food
bank ran out of containers at about
1:45. But it was an orderly crowd,
even after the food ran out at 2:15
and some 500 persons were still
waiting in line. Some of them had
waited since 10:30.
"Everybody's been real mannerly,"
one of those waiting said. An
unemployed laborer, he had driven up
from San Jose with his wife and
daughter.
"It don't look like we're going to
get any food," he said in a soft
Kentucky drawl. "Well, if we don't,
we just don't."
Delays
A young man several yards down in
line said, "They should have managed
this better. I've been waiting for two
and one-half hours and I still don't
know if 111 get any. SLA will find out
how screwed up this is."
A black woman, whose family is on
welfare, complained, "Randolph
Hearst's got obligations to get his
daughter back, and he's not filling
them. If he wants her back bad
enough, he'll sell his mansion — he
could sell a lot more than his mansion.

Added an elderly white woman:
"I've been waiting hero for two hours,
and I'll wait till midnight if they pass
out food. I get $150-a-month social
security. I can't live on that.
"The kidnaping is very sad, but it's
the only way rich people will listen."
A chicano who described herself as
a housewife said, "Maybe what the
SLA is doing isn't right. Rich people
shouldn't be forced to give their
money away."
When asked why she was accepting
the food, she replied, "We need it. As
long as they're doing it, we shouldn't
be left out."
No Argument
Said a tall, thin, young black man:
"I'm a veteran, and I can't get nothin'.
The President and the corporations are
going to have to see how many people
are hungry and angry. This is the
greatest thing that's ever happened in
America."
An older white man, who had been
listening, smiled and turned away.
"I don't want to start a fight," he
said quietly, "but I think this is one of
the worst things that's ever happened
in America."
A food truck arrived at 3 p.m. and
the crowd grew eager. "Now we'll get
some food," an aged black man said.
But the truck contained only
oranges and bananas. The bananas
were a bright, upripe green, and they
drew only derisive laughter.
After a short delay, the center's
organizers decided simply to close for
the day at 3:30, and the crowd
dispersed, disappointed but still
orderly.
The atmosphere at the East Palo
Alto center was in marked contrast to
that at other distribution points. At
the East Oakland food bank, violence
broke out among a crowd of over
3000 who had waited for food, only
to have it thrown to them from
delivery trucks.
The food distribution program is
scheduled to resume tomorrow.
