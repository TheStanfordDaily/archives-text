# Director Asks Funds For Resident Guests
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Guest-in-Residence program, a
branch of the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
has not provided much help to the
bureau this year, according to program
director Andrew Leuchter.
The reason, contends Leuchter, is
that the program is "grossly
understaffed" and insufficiently
funded.
The program, designed to allow
visiting speakers to stay in dormitories
for several days to encourage them to
interact with students, was created at
the end of last year by Charles
Ogletree, ASSU vice president and
head of the Speakers Bureau.
Leuchter said he told Ogletree last
spring that he would run the program,
but "Ogletree did not give me full
responsibility for Guest-in-Residence
until this December."
Recruitment Campaign
Leuchter began plans for a staff
recruitment at that time. However,
this campaign did not actually begin
until two weeks ago, and included
"heavy leafleting" to solicit support
for his program. Several students have
joined him since then, Leuchter said,
but many more are needed.
"I would like to organize a basic
committee of 15 to 20 students, with
perhaps as many as 50 other students
manning the program," Leuchter said.
Leuchter explained that the
students would be needed to maintain
a publicity office, carry out the
general mechanics of bringing speakers
to campus and find speakers places to
stay.
Bureau Needs Funds
Ogletree said that up until now,
providing living arrangements for guest
speakers has been a "spur-of-the
moment thing."
Agreeing with Leuchter that the
program is suffering from insufficient
funding, Ogletree said the funding
problem extends to the entire
Speakers Bureau.

"The operation of the Bureau has
been hampered by a lack of funds,
causing a decline in the number of
speakers on campus this year, and also
causing inadequate publicity for the
speakers that have come," he said.
Most Money Gone
According to Ogletree, most of the
$2000 left over from last year's
$12,000 fee assessment has gone to
speakers who lectured earlier this year.
Leuchter said that only about $100
remains for use by his program, while
the cost of a lecture by a prominent
speaker ranges from $500 to $1500.
Because of this, Leuchter emphasized
that all his efforts are going toward
getting the program running smoothly
by next year.
Leuchter and Ogletree both
mentioned plans to bring a new fee
assessment before the students on the
spring ballot.
"I wasn't thinking about getting
money before [being named director
in December]," Leuchter said.
"However, once I became full director
for the program, I saw that the entire
Bureau needed both more staff and
funds."
Business-Like Bureau
Both Ogletree and Leuchter agreed
that the Speakers Bureau "should be
run like a business," not subject to
annual change like student
government. In this way, Ogletree said,
the Bureau could maintain some type
of organization from year to year.
Speakers brought to campus by the
Bureau this year have included Black
Panther leader Bobby Seale, native
American spokesman Birgil Killstraight
and State Sen. Mervyn Dymally.
Ogletree denied that invitations to
the three (all members of minority
groups) represented an overemphasis
on minority speakers: "We've
accommodated every group who has
come in and submitted a proposal."

"heavy leafleting" to solicit support
for his program. Several students have
joined him since then, Leuchter said,
but many more are needed.
"I would like to organize a basic
committee of 15 to 20 students, with
perhaps as many as 50 other students
manning the program," Leuchter said.
Leuchter explained that the
students would be needed to maintain
a publicity office, carry out the
general mechanics of bringing speakers
to campus and find speakers places to
stay.
Bureau Needs Funds
Ogletree said that up until now,
providing living arrangements for guest
speakers has been a "spur-of-the
moment thing."
Agreeing with Leuchter that the
program is suffering from insufficient
funding, Ogletree said the funding
problem extends to the entire
Speakers Bureau.

"The operation of the Bureau has
been hampered by a lack of funds,
causing a decline in the number of
speakers on campus this year, and also
causing inadequate publicity for the
speakers that have come," he said.
Most Money Gone
According to Ogletree, most of the
$2000 left over from last year's
$12,000 fee assessment has gone to
speakers who lectured earlier this year.
Leuchter said that only about $100
remains for use by his program, while
the cost of a lecture by a prominent
speaker ranges from $500 to $1500.
Because of this, Leuchter emphasized
that all his efforts are going toward
getting the program running smoothly
by next year.
Leuchter and Ogletree both
mentioned plans to bring a new fee
assessment before the students on the
spring ballot.
"I wasn't thinking about getting
money before [being named director
in December]," Leuchter said.
"However, once I became full director
for the program, I saw that the entire
Bureau needed both more staff and
funds."
Business-Like Bureau
Both Ogletree and Leuchter agreed
that the Speakers Bureau "should be
run like a business," not subject to
annual change like student
government. In this way, Ogletree said,
the Bureau could maintain some type
of organization from year to year.
Speakers brought to campus by the
Bureau this year have included Black
Panther leader Bobby Seale, native
American spokesman Birgil Killstraight
and State Sen. Mervyn Dymally.
Ogletree denied that invitations to
the three (all members of minority
groups) represented an overemphasis
on minority speakers: "We've
accommodated every group who has
come in and submitted a proposal."
The Guest-in-Residence program, a
branch of the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
has not provided much help to the
bureau this year, according to program
director Andrew Leuchter.
The reason, contends Leuchter, is
that the program is "grossly
understaffed" and insufficiently
funded.
The program, designed to allow
visiting speakers to stay in dormitories
for several days to encourage them to
interact with students, was created at
the end of last year by Charles
Ogletree, ASSU vice president and
head of the Speakers Bureau.
Leuchter said he told Ogletree last
spring that he would run the program,
but "Ogletree did not give me full
responsibility for Guest-in-Residence
until this December."
Recruitment Campaign
Leuchter began plans for a staff
recruitment at that time. However,
this campaign did not actually begin
until two weeks ago, and included
"heavy leafleting" to solicit support
for his program. Several students have
joined him since then, Leuchter said,
but many more are needed.
"I would like to organize a basic
committee of 15 to 20 students, with
