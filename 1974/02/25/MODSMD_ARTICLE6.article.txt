# Rep. Waldie Raps Nixon, Oil Shortage
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Gubernatorial candidate Rep.
Jerome Waldie, D-Antioch, told a
private gathering of supporters before
his public appearance at Await High
School in Mountain View Saturday
night, "I'm not one of those
candidates who believe that as
Democrats all we have to do is sit back
and let the fruit [the election] drop
into our lap.
"It's going to drop, but we'd better
be there with some programs to catch

land use, and tension between the
environment and the energy shortage,
Waldie told a crowd of 250 that his

"These contributions have permitted
just as strong a stranglehold on the
political system as on the financial
one.
Waldie has raised about $300,000
for his campaign and is spending about
$10,000 a month. He makes public his
campaign funds and his personal assets
and liabilities.
"We are the least well funded
campaign," he said before his speech.
"You don't talk about the issues I'm
talking about and expect to receive
traditional contributions from people
who usually contribute."
However, money may not be the
key to this year's election, Waldie
ventured. "Watergate may really bring
it about that a candidate could win
without spending the most money. My
