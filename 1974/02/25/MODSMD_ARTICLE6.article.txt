# Rep. Waldie Raps Nixon, Oil Shortage
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Gubernatorial candidate Rep.
Jerome Waldie, D-Antioch, told a
private gathering of supporters before
his public appearance at Await High
School in Mountain View Saturday
night, "I'm not one of those
candidates who believe that as
Democrats all we have to do is sit back
and let the fruit [the election] drop
into our lap.
"It's going to drop, but we'd better
be there with some programs to catch
it when it does."
Speaking on tax reform, Watergate,
land use, and tension between the
environment and the energy shortage,
Waldie told a crowd of 250 that his
walks through 690 miles of the state
confirmed that "the people" are
behind him.
Diving into the controversy, the 49
year-old congressman, who will forfeit
his House seat to run for governor,
charged, "The oil crisis is contrived by
the oil companies" to maximize their
profits, to relax environmental
controls and to eliminate competition.
"It's inconceivable that they aren't
regulated like any other public utility.
It's monopolistic," he said. The federal
government ought to have the power
"to demand confirmation of their
statistics upon which they predicate
this crisis, [and]... we ought to
create a competing means of drilling,
refining and distributing oil."
Political Stranglehold
Pointing to a $5.3 million
contribution to the Nixon campaign
from the oil companies, Waldie said,
"These contributions have permitted
just as strong a stranglehold on the
political system as on the financial
one.
Waldie has raised about $300,000
for his campaign and is spending about
$10,000 a month. He makes public his
campaign funds and his personal assets
and liabilities.
"We are the least well funded
campaign," he said before his speech.
"You don't talk about the issues I'm
talking about and expect to receive
traditional contributions from people
who usually contribute."
However, money may not be the
key to this year's election, Waldie
ventured. "Watergate may really bring
it about that a candidate could win
without spending the most money. My
candidacy may be at the right time
and right place."
A member of the House Judiciary
Committee investigating Watergate,
Waldie predicted that "by the end of
the year, Gerald Ford will be President
— and that is not all good, by the
way."
"I have never seen such a decline in
the level of confidence as I am reading
now in the people of California," said
Waldie, who served as a Contra Costa
County assemblyman for seven years
before being elected to Congress in
1966. He pointed out, "If Nixon is in
trouble in the fCalifornia Central]
Valley, he is in trouble all over."
Waldie rated the success of Nixon's
economic policies as low as his
credibility. "The costs of the failure of
national economic programs fall most
heavily upon the state," he said.
Consequently, the [state] budget, to
meet the needs of the state, has got to
go up."

He favors diverting funds from
highway construction in order to
"catch up on rapid transit," in
accordance with the upcoming
Proposition 5. The gasoline shortage —
not crisis — calls for "a development
of other forms of energy and a
reduction of the consumption of oil,"
he said.
Supporting preservation of the
environment in addition to conserving
energy, Waldie proposed a statewide
land use plan forcing private
developers to work within the
framework of the public interest.
Waldie, one of 14 congressmen to
receive a 100 percent vote of
confidence from the League of
Conservation Voters, has fought
against the California Water Project
and off-shore oil drilling in Santa
Barbara.
Speaking of taxes, Waldie said he
would try to close loopholes. "There is
no reason to insulate banks and
corporations and millionaires from
taxes.
"It's not the revenue that is so
important. I'm after the principle of
equity. If I've got to pay it [taxes],
they ought to pay it,"he said, alluding
to several of his wealthy opponents.
