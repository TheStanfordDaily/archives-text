# SLA Reaction

Bernard Smallwood

The left in general is freaked
out by the Symbionese Liberation
Army. They are freaked out
because there is no real leadership,
no direction in the new left
movement itself.
The only thing the leaders
within the new left know about
the S.L.A. is that they don't like
it. And the primary reason for this
attitude is a feeling that the
actions of the S.L.A. will only
increase police repression.
But these leaders fail to
understand why groups like the
S.L.A. come about; they focus
primarily on the cart and ignore
the horse. In other words just like
the mass media, they are focusing
on the symptoms and ignoring the
problems â€” the facts that hunger,
poor housing, racism, sexism, and
no jobs all exist. These conditions
are very real, and they are all an
integral part of this society,
affecting primarily people of color
and poor white working people.
These so-called "leaders" of
the left understand that it is
wrong to dictate to the people
what they want and how to go
about getting it without
consulting them. However, they
fail to understand that it is
equally wrong to not be prepared
to engage in struggle when the
people are ready.
Radical Change Discredited
It is true that the police and
the mass media are attempting to
use the S.L.A. to discredit all
struggles for radical change in this
country, and this is bad. But I
believe that it is possible to turn a
bad thing into a good thing, and
in order for us to do this our
priorities must be service and
response to the needs and
problems of the people; and
decisions to be made affecting the
people must involve their
participation and determination.
It is unfortunate that the needs
and problems of the people,
which are a reality, receive public
attention only when critical
situations like this arise.
Are we going to call for a
harder crackdown on all people
struggling for radical change in
this country, are we going to call
for new laws to give increased
power to the police? Are we going
to forget that it is, in fact, the
oppression and the violence of the
state which gives rise to groups
such as the S.L.A.?
There is a historical lesson we
can draw from our government's
involvement in Vietnam. Namely,
that oppression and exploitation,
i.e. U.S. Imperialism, breed
resistance. Wherever oppression
exists, the people will fight back
even if it means giving up their
lives.
Concentration Camps
The ghettoes and jails in
amerikka which are nothing more
than concentration camps for the
poor are breeding grounds for
resistance. Where else can the
poor, the so-called "criminals" get
together to draw up plans to
"defend" themselves? In these
Nazi-like concentration camps the
poor are students, and there they
learn that their only solution for
survival is violence against a
system using violence against
them.
I will say to the Nixons, the
Rockefellers, the Hearsts and to
their puppets, the state police,
that the solution to ihis resistance
is not to kill and destroy the
resisters, but to eliminate the
social conditions which gave rise
to the resistance.
We would prefer that these
social changes take place by
peaceful means. But experience
has shown that the ruling class
never relinquishes power
voluntarily; the government will
never fall even in a period of crisis
such as Watergate and the energy
crisis, unless it is pushed.

1 Understanding this, it would be
1 wrong to go out wolfing
t individually at the system with
, "BB guns" because the puppets of
; the ruling class with their military
power will kill you and do.
In order to be successful, we
must push with the people, not
against them. To push alone
would only give the state police
reason to take a better aim with
their war machine against the
people, especially the poor.
The War Brought Home
i Young American men were
i forced to commit Immoral,
terrorist acts overseas. But they
have now returned home very
much skilled in how to fight the
"enemy;" they have taught their
sisters and brothers these skills
and they are now fighting for a
cause they themselves consider
just. They have brought the war
home.
However, the irony of the U.S.
ruling class continues even with
the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst.
How much media attention would
be given if the daughter of a poor
black family was kidnapped? How
many thousands of dollars would
be sent to the family by the
Nixons, the Reagans, and yes, the
Hearsts? Even more important,
would the people themselves care?
Or has the ruling class-controlled
mass media convinced them that
we should only be concerned
when the sons and daughters or
rich men are kidnapped?
It is true that the S.L.A. is
using "revolution-through-the
media" tactics. The S.L.A.'s
tactics and strategy for revolution
are being published in full the
same as a Nixon speech.
Media Interest
Never before has the mass
media shown such a high interest
in the Left. They are even quoting
Lenin and Mao, not to deal with
the just demands put forward by
the S.L.A., but rather to condemn
their tactics. They are still asking
what do those people want.
The demands put forward by
the S.L.A. should have been met
yesterday by rich America, but
even now at the risk of Patricia
Hearst's life they still choose to
focus primarily on who did it
instead of why they did it.
I will say this to all people who
claim they want to struggle: is it
necessary for us to follow the
path of the ruling class and their
mass media? Could we not better
serve the people by dealing
primarily with the objective
realities of hunger, poor housing,
lack of jobs, racism, sexism, etc.
all of which are social conditions
directly affecting the poor?
I strongly question the
sincerity of those who chose to
deal primarily with their
subjective feelings about Patricia
Hearst and the S.L.A.. ..
SLA Counter-Revolutionary
Futhermore, the so-called
S.L.A. is nothing more than a
counter-revolutionary terrorist
organization apparently under the
leadership of lumpen or
petty-bourgeoise revolutionary
romanticizers. There is also a
possibility that they are paid
agents of the state. The results of
their actions would be the same.
This call to terrorist activity by
the S.L.A. is merely a way of
avoiding the urgent task of
brininging political knowledge to
the working class. Therefore, they
are absolutely incapable of leading
the masses of poor and working
people in revolutionary struggle.
I am not connected with the
S.L.A., have never been connected
with it, and the disbanded
organization Venceremos has
never been connected with it.
