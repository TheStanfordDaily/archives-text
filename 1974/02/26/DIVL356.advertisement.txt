SPRING QUARTER ADVANCE REGISTRATION
Currently registered students can pick up Advance Registration Permits to Register ( PTR's)
from their departments or advisors Tuesday, February 26, through Tuesday, March 12, and can
advance register in the lobby of the Old Union from Wednesday, February 27 - Wednesday, March
13.
The Advance Registration procedure and the schedule for signing class lists are on page 2 of the
Spring Time Schedule, available in the lobby of the Old Union. Class list signing will be done en
tirely by alphabetical grouping and individual exceptions to the schedule cannot be made. A
senior, however, who is scheduled to sign class lists toward the end of advance registration and
anticipates extreme difficulty in getting into a particular class may petition to sign a class list
during the beginning of Advance Registration. Petitions are now available at the Information
Windows in the lobby of the Old Union; they should explain the necessity of signing up earlier than
scheduled, be signed by the student's advisor, and be returned to the Information Window as soon
as possible.
Students who pick up Advance Registration PTR's but do not advance register should get new
PTR's on registration day, April 1,1974 at Memorial Auditorium.
