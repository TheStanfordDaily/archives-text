# Nixon Renounces Resignation
## 'I Don't Expect To Be Impeached' 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - President Nixon
said last night "I do not expect to be
impeached," and renounced
resignation as a step he said would
threaten the survival of the presidency
itself.
". . . It is vitally important in this
nation that the presidency of the
United States not be hostage to what
happens to the popularity of a
president at one time or another," he

told a nationally broadcast news
conference.
So, while he forecast Republican
successes in the 1974 congressional
elections, Nixon repeated his vow that
he will never resign, even if GOP
candidates face the prospect of
wholesale defeats.
. . We have a lot of work left to
do, more than three years left to do,
and I'm going to stay here until I get it
done," he said, leaning forward, jaw

set as if to emphasize his words.
"I want my party to survive, but
more important I want the presidency
to survive," he said.
Economic Improvement
One of the prime problems on that
agenda is the energy crisis, which, with
Watergate, impeachment and the
economy, were major topics of the
38-minute news conference.
Nixon said he believes gasoline
rationing can be avoided, but
threatened to veto an emergency
energy bill now pending in Congress
because of its price rollback
provisions.
He said the administration "will not
stand by .. . and allow a recession to
occur." Nixon conceded that inflation
remains a nagging problem, but said he
expects the economic picture to
improve in the second half of the year.
The President disclosed that he had
declined on constitutional grounds a
request from special prosecutor Leon
Jaworski that he testify before a grand
jury. He said he offered to answer
questions in writing or to meet with
Jaworski personally, but the special
prosecutor did not want to proceed in
that way.
Nixon also said that in the
judgment of White House lawyers, a
criminal offense is required as grounds
for the impeachment of a President.
Arab Embargo Lifted
Discussing energy problems, Nixon
said he expects the Arab oil embargo
will be lifted, but did not say when
that might happen.
He said progress toward a peace
settlement in the Middie East will be
helpful in efforts to get the embargo
lifted.
If it is not lifted, Nixon said, "it
will slow down thy efforts we are
making on the peace front."
The President said he believes
"there is a much better than even
chance" that the nation can weather
the energy crisis without gasoline
rationing.
But he said price rollback

provisions in an emergency energy
conservation bill now before Congress
would change that prospect. Nixon
said he would veto that bill if it comes
to him with the rollback provision.
Energy Crisis Passing
Nixon said the energy shortage had
led to predictions that fuel oil would
be short, leading to hardships in the
home and in the factory, but "we have
now passed through that crisis."
He acknowledged that the gasoline
shortage remains severe, particularly in
the East, and said the federal energy
office is prepared to take further steps
to deal with that if necessary.
Nixon said he believes the waiting
lines at gasoline stations will be
alleviated by spring or summertime.
"In fact that is the objective of our
program and I think we will achieve
it,"he said.
At the same time, he said the price
of gasoline is not going to decrease
until more supplies become available.

jury. He said he offered to answer
questions in writing or to meet with
Jaworski personally, but the special
prosecutor did not want to proceed in
that way.
Nixon also said that in the
judgment of White House lawyers, a
criminal offense is required as grounds
for the impeachment of a President.
Arab Embargo Lifted
Discussing energy problems, Nixon
said he expects the Arab oil embargo
will be lifted, but did not say when
that might happen.
He said progress toward a peace
settlement in the Middie East will be
helpful in efforts to get the embargo
lifted.
If it is not lifted, Nixon said, "it
will slow down thy efforts we are
making on the peace front."
The President said he believes
"there is a much better than even
chance" that the nation can weather
the energy crisis without gasoline
rationing.
But he said price rollback

provisions in an emergency energy
conservation bill now before Congress
would change that prospect. Nixon
said he would veto that bill if it comes
to him with the rollback provision.
Energy Crisis Passing
Nixon said the energy shortage had
led to predictions that fuel oil would
be short, leading to hardships in the
home and in the factory, but "we have
now passed through that crisis."
He acknowledged that the gasoline
shortage remains severe, particularly in
the East, and said the federal energy
office is prepared to take further steps
to deal with that if necessary.
Nixon said he believes the waiting
lines at gasoline stations will be
alleviated by spring or summertime.
"In fact that is the objective of our
program and I think we will achieve
it,"he said.
At the same time, he said the price
of gasoline is not going to decrease
until more supplies become available.
WASHINGTON - President Nixon
said last night "I do not expect to be
impeached," and renounced
resignation as a step he said would
threaten the survival of the presidency
itself.
". . . It is vitally important in this
nation that the presidency of the
United States not be hostage to what
happens to the popularity of a
president at one time or another," he

told a nationally broadcast news
conference.
So, while he forecast Republican
successes in the 1974 congressional
elections, Nixon repeated his vow that
he will never resign, even if GOP
candidates face the prospect of
wholesale defeats.
. . We have a lot of work left to
do, more than three years left to do,
and I'm going to stay here until I get it
done," he said, leaning forward, jaw

set as if to emphasize his words.
"I want my party to survive, but
more important I want the presidency
to survive," he said.
Economic Improvement
One of the prime problems on that
agenda is the energy crisis, which, with
Watergate, impeachment and the
economy, were major topics of the
38-minute news conference.
Nixon said he believes gasoline
rationing can be avoided, but
threatened to veto an emergency
energy bill now pending in Congress
because of its price rollback
provisions.
He said the administration "will not
stand by .. . and allow a recession to
occur." Nixon conceded that inflation
remains a nagging problem, but said he
expects the economic picture to
improve in the second half of the year.
The President disclosed that he had
declined on constitutional grounds a
request from special prosecutor Leon
Jaworski that he testify before a grand
jury. He said he offered to answer
questions in writing or to meet with
Jaworski personally, but the special
prosecutor did not want to proceed in
that way.
Nixon also said that in the
judgment of White House lawyers, a
criminal offense is required as grounds
