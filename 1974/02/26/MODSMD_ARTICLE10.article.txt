# Feature Articles Without Fluff
## 
### 
Claire Spiegel

It is a common but mistaken
notion that feature stories should
be light-hearted and end happily.
Traditionally, such ditties have
made the morning newspaper
palatable by balancing the "bad"
news.
The reader, then, may be
shocked when the feature story is
as raw and realistic as the rest of
the news. He may believe that
Reality is poaching on his fanciful
preserves.
It has been the unstated policy
of the Daily features department
in selecting and researching stories
to look behind the scenes in
examining lifestyles and events
and to report findings in a
realistic, accurate, informative
manner.
Just as the news reporter is
obliged to write his story without
touch-ups, the feature writer who
happens to discover a
disagreeable, controversial or
unconventional situation should
write his feature without fluff.
Confrontations With Reality
For instance, beneath the
glamor of medical school lies the
med student's inescapable
confrontation with the dead
human body. Or, along with the
joys of living together as one big
happy family in a coed house,
comes the problem of deciding
whether this togetherness should
extend into the bathroom.
Again, belying the stereotype
of the naive freshman girl, is the
statistic reported by Dr. Warren
Miller last fall that nearly 35
percent were sexually active in
high school. And finally, rippling
the placid surface of heads bowed
studiously over books in the
library, is the streaker running
nude through UGLY's stacks.
The Daily features department
reported each of these as
accurately and fairly as possible.
However, regardless of the
reporter's tact, these articles, by
nature of their unconventional
content, are bound to offend
some readers. Death, for example,
strikes a delicate chord in people,
and some may find the idea of
med students dissecting a human

cadaver very worrisome.
To take another instance,
reports of streakers may upset a
student who is bothered by the
nudity so prevalent these days.
Although reporters are usually
aware of these sensitivities, they
can not censor quotes, edit
content, and cater their stories to
squeamish readers.
Hopefully, whatever the
reader's emotional reaction, he
will recognize the informational
content of a piece. Learning about
a medical student's adjustment to
working on a cadaver may help
the freshman perhaps decide
whether he is suited to medicine.
It may suggest to us all to make
arrangements for contributing our
bodies to science.
Perhaps, the streakers indicate
a return from radical activism to

fraternity fun. At any rate, the
social comments in these pieces
need not be spelled out.
For my part, I am most willing
, to retract factual inaccuracies in
my stories; however, I stand by
the substance of the articles.
Criticism, discounting such from
persons with an ax to grind or a
1 grudge to satisfy, is appreciated. A
department and its reporters must
be open to criticism, but readers
should understand a reluctance to
submit to every complaint.
Paraphrasing the anecdote of the
old man and lad traveling to town
with the donkey illustrates my
point:
A group of passers-by exclaims
what fools these travelers are to
let their donkey frolic ahead of
them, while they, themselves,

trudge along behind. So the lad
mounts the donkey, and after he
has ridden a ways, a second group
of passers-by criticizes the
impertinant lad for making the
poor old man limp behind. The
lad dismounts, the old man climbs
on, and a third group of
passers-by pities the poor little
waif. Then both the old man and
the lad mount the beast, but a
fourth group of passers-by berates
them for their cruelty to animals.
At this point, the man and the lad
dismount — and carry the donkey.
Like the travelers, we feature
reporters should be responsive to
public criticism, but we must be
wary lest we, too, end up carrying
the ass!

It is a common but mistaken
notion that feature stories should
be light-hearted and end happily.
Traditionally, such ditties have
made the morning newspaper
palatable by balancing the "bad"
news.
The reader, then, may be
shocked when the feature story is
as raw and realistic as the rest of
the news. He may believe that
Reality is poaching on his fanciful
preserves.
It has been the unstated policy
of the Daily features department
in selecting and researching stories
to look behind the scenes in
examining lifestyles and events
and to report findings in a
realistic, accurate, informative
manner.
Just as the news reporter is
obliged to write his story without
touch-ups, the feature writer who
happens to discover a
disagreeable, controversial or
unconventional situation should
write his feature without fluff.
Confrontations With Reality
For instance, beneath the
glamor of medical school lies the
med student's inescapable
confrontation with the dead
human body. Or, along with the
joys of living together as one big
happy family in a coed house,
comes the problem of deciding
whether this togetherness should
extend into the bathroom.
Again, belying the stereotype
of the naive freshman girl, is the
statistic reported by Dr. Warren
Miller last fall that nearly 35
percent were sexually active in
high school. And finally, rippling
the placid surface of heads bowed
studiously over books in the
library, is the streaker running
nude through UGLY's stacks.
The Daily features department
reported each of these as
accurately and fairly as possible.
However, regardless of the
reporter's tact, these articles, by
nature of their unconventional
content, are bound to offend
some readers. Death, for example,
strikes a delicate chord in people,
and some may find the idea of
med students dissecting a human

cadaver very worrisome.
To take another instance,
reports of streakers may upset a
student who is bothered by the
nudity so prevalent these days.
Although reporters are usually
aware of these sensitivities, they
can not censor quotes, edit
content, and cater their stories to
squeamish readers.
Hopefully, whatever the
reader's emotional reaction, he
will recognize the informational
content of a piece. Learning about
a medical student's adjustment to
working on a cadaver may help
the freshman perhaps decide
whether he is suited to medicine.
It may suggest to us all to make
arrangements for contributing our
bodies to science.
Perhaps, the streakers indicate
a return from radical activism to

fraternity fun. At any rate, the
social comments in these pieces
need not be spelled out.
For my part, I am most willing
, to retract factual inaccuracies in
my stories; however, I stand by
the substance of the articles.
Criticism, discounting such from
persons with an ax to grind or a
1 grudge to satisfy, is appreciated. A
department and its reporters must
be open to criticism, but readers
should understand a reluctance to
submit to every complaint.
Paraphrasing the anecdote of the
old man and lad traveling to town
with the donkey illustrates my
point:
A group of passers-by exclaims
what fools these travelers are to
let their donkey frolic ahead of
them, while they, themselves,

trudge along behind. So the lad
mounts the donkey, and after he
has ridden a ways, a second group
of passers-by criticizes the
impertinant lad for making the
poor old man limp behind. The
lad dismounts, the old man climbs
on, and a third group of
passers-by pities the poor little
waif. Then both the old man and
the lad mount the beast, but a
fourth group of passers-by berates
them for their cruelty to animals.
