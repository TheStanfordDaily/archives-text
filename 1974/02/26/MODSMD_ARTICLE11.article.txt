As negotiations between USE and the University
approach a crisis, with the possibility of a strike by
1400 technical-maintenance-service unit employees
facing the campus, responsible journalism is crucial.
It is unfortunate that in an otherwise accurate
article by reporter Don Cox (Feb. 22, Daily) two
separate statements which I made at Thursday
night's meeting of non-unit
(clerical-professional-hospital) USE members were
juxtaposed so as to render a false impression of the
likelihood of a strike.
I would like to correct this, lest the University's
negotiators be misled to underestimate the
mood of unit workers, continue in their present
hardline position, and thus precipitate a strike
which no one really wants.
I was quoted correctly as saying, "It appears
that unit people are enough of a minority (1400
out of 8000 campus workers) that it is not going to
be possible to shut down the University in the
event of a strike situation." This was not meant to
imply that the unit will not strike, or that when it
strikes it will not be effective.
University managers are already beginning to
experience the dissatisfaction of unit workers in
subtle ways. Significant economic consequences
will be dealt the University when key workers in
sensitive positions strike.
But the next quote was taken out of context. I
was speaking only about non-unit workers when I
said it is "premature and suicidal for us (the 300
non-unit members of USE) to go cn strike' along

with the 1400 unit people.
Jim Berk proposes that for self-protection
non-unit workers should formulate demands of our
own, couple these to the unit's contract demands,
and if necessary strike together. Can we, for
examplp, form a consensus on the demand for a
campus-wide 'cost-of-living' formula to adjust
wages to reflect the impact of inflation on our
buying power? If USE's cost-of-living proposal was
adopted by Stanford, our wages would rise
$6/month for each one percent increase in prices.
(Prices rose one percent last month along, 9.4
percent last year.)
For Berk's proposal to be effective, a more
significant number of non-unit people must show
their support for such a course of action. Workers
outside the bargaining unit are not neutral. Soon
we may be asked to show which side we are on.

which no one really wants.
I was quoted correctly as saying, "It appears
that unit people are enough of a minority (1400
out of 8000 campus workers) that it is not going to
be possible to shut down the University in the
event of a strike situation." This was not meant to
imply that the unit will not strike, or that when it
strikes it will not be effective.
University managers are already beginning to
experience the dissatisfaction of unit workers in
subtle ways. Significant economic consequences
will be dealt the University when key workers in
sensitive positions strike.
But the next quote was taken out of context. I
was speaking only about non-unit workers when I
said it is "premature and suicidal for us (the 300
non-unit members of USE) to go cn strike' along

with the 1400 unit people.
Jim Berk proposes that for self-protection
non-unit workers should formulate demands of our
own, couple these to the unit's contract demands,
and if necessary strike together. Can we, for
examplp, form a consensus on the demand for a
campus-wide 'cost-of-living' formula to adjust
wages to reflect the impact of inflation on our
buying power? If USE's cost-of-living proposal was
adopted by Stanford, our wages would rise
$6/month for each one percent increase in prices.
(Prices rose one percent last month along, 9.4
percent last year.)
For Berk's proposal to be effective, a more
significant number of non-unit people must show
their support for such a course of action. Workers
outside the bargaining unit are not neutral. Soon
we may be asked to show which side we are on.

As negotiations between USE and the University
approach a crisis, with the possibility of a strike by
1400 technical-maintenance-service unit employees
facing the campus, responsible journalism is crucial.
It is unfortunate that in an otherwise accurate
article by reporter Don Cox (Feb. 22, Daily) two
separate statements which I made at Thursday
night's meeting of non-unit
(clerical-professional-hospital) USE members were
juxtaposed so as to render a false impression of the
likelihood of a strike.
I would like to correct this, lest the University's
negotiators be misled to underestimate the
mood of unit workers, continue in their present
hardline position, and thus precipitate a strike
which no one really wants.
