# Swim Team Blues

Something is happening which
I feel I should share with you. It is
of great importance and is typical
of what goes on in the Women's
Physical Education Department
when teams are "taught" by
physical educators and not
"coached" by athletic coaches.
In addition to its fall quarter
program, Stanford offered a
women's competitive swimming
course this quarter for the first
time in recent history. The main
purpose of the competitive class
during the winter was to prepare
women for the Women's National
Swimming Championships which
are comparable to the NCAA's. As
far back as 1969-70, women have
qualified to go to the nations;
however, last year was the first
time women from Stanford were
sent to compete.
The Women's Physical
Education Department has had
many reasons for not permitting
the women to compete in the
Nationals, (i.e. "You cannot go to
the Nationals because the
Department does not have the
money to send you and it is
against Departmental policy for
an athlete to pay her own way
and there is no competitive
swimming offered winter quarter
and therefore no team, so how
could you possibly represent
Stanford when we have no team
this quarter?")
As far as I am concerned, these
reasons were completely
insufficient and read like scenes
from Catch 22. Unfortunately, a
number of talented women
swimmers on this campus were
denied the opportunity to
compete at the national level
because of such convoluted logic.
Strong Team
Our women's swimming team
has taken the Northern California
Conference for the last two years,
and this year the team is
exceptionally strong. Top
swimmers include World Student
Games competitor Vicki Hays and
Malaysian Olympian Mai Ong. Sue
Trupin, Jackie Brink and Kathy
Heinze have made the National
cutoff times along with freshman
Nan Leuschel. These girls have
worked hard supplementing the
women's program by attending
the men's morning training
sessions under coaches Jim
Gaughran and Jeff Hammett.
Two weeks ago Stanford
hosted an invitational swimming
meet in which we had a 200 yard
freestyle relay place sth, just
slipping under the National
qualifying standard for this event.
Two of the girls on this relay had
not previously qualified for the
Nationals in any other event.
The Women's Physical
Education Department has told
them that this qualifies them for
the National Championships, and
that they will swim on the 200
freestyle relay that represents
Stanford. However, this relay
team is not the best possible
combination of swimmers that we
have.
Not Fastest Team
Previously this season another
Stanford relay team posted a time
a full five seconds under the time
registered by the relay team at the
Invitational. Also, two other
swimmers already qualified for
Nationals in other events have
faster times in the 50 freestyle
than the two girls who have
qualified on the relay alone.
What coach in his or her right
mind would take a team to the
National Championships and not
field the bent possible swimmers
in every event????
It seems that the Women's
Department is determined to send
these two swimmers to Hershey,
Penn. for the Nationals. They feel
that it would be a "good
educational experience" for the
girls to go and swim on our 200
freestyle relay. I feel otherwise.
Best Team Needed
This is high level athletics and
one should field the best possible
team. Intercollegiate athletics is
not a welfare institution. You
don't give away places on a relay
team; you earn them with fast
times and hard work.
It has taken women's athletics
at Stanford a long time to get
sufficient funds to support a high
caliber intercollegiate program.
We have yet to obtain the level of
recognition we deserve for our
fine athletes. I feel very strongly
that this hard-earned money
should be spent wisely and not be
used to field a relay team that is
less than the best to represent this
University at the National level.

them that this qualifies them for
the National Championships, and
that they will swim on the 200
freestyle relay that represents
Stanford. However, this relay
team is not the best possible
combination of swimmers that we
have.
Not Fastest Team
Previously this season another
Stanford relay team posted a time
a full five seconds under the time
registered by the relay team at the
Invitational. Also, two other
swimmers already qualified for
Nationals in other events have
faster times in the 50 freestyle
than the two girls who have
qualified on the relay alone.
What coach in his or her right
mind would take a team to the
National Championships and not
field the bent possible swimmers
in every event????
It seems that the Women's
Department is determined to send
these two swimmers to Hershey,
Penn. for the Nationals. They feel
that it would be a "good
educational experience" for the
girls to go and swim on our 200
freestyle relay. I feel otherwise.
Best Team Needed
This is high level athletics and
one should field the best possible
team. Intercollegiate athletics is
not a welfare institution. You
don't give away places on a relay
team; you earn them with fast
times and hard work.
It has taken women's athletics
at Stanford a long time to get
sufficient funds to support a high
caliber intercollegiate program.
We have yet to obtain the level of
recognition we deserve for our
fine athletes. I feel very strongly
that this hard-earned money
should be spent wisely and not be
used to field a relay team that is
less than the best to represent this
University at the National level.

Something is happening which
I feel I should share with you. It is
of great importance and is typical
of what goes on in the Women's
Physical Education Department
when teams are "taught" by
physical educators and not
"coached" by athletic coaches.
In addition to its fall quarter
program, Stanford offered a
women's competitive swimming
course this quarter for the first
time in recent history. The main
purpose of the competitive class
during the winter was to prepare
women for the Women's National
Swimming Championships which
are comparable to the NCAA's. As
far back as 1969-70, women have
qualified to go to the nations;
however, last year was the first
time women from Stanford were
sent to compete.
The Women's Physical
Education Department has had
many reasons for not permitting
the women to compete in the
Nationals, (i.e. "You cannot go to
the Nationals because the
Department does not have the
money to send you and it is
against Departmental policy for
an athlete to pay her own way
and there is no competitive
swimming offered winter quarter
and therefore no team, so how
could you possibly represent
Stanford when we have no team
this quarter?")
As far as I am concerned, these
reasons were completely
insufficient and read like scenes
from Catch 22. Unfortunately, a
number of talented women
swimmers on this campus were
denied the opportunity to
compete at the national level
because of such convoluted logic.
Strong Team
Our women's swimming team
has taken the Northern California
Conference for the last two years,
and this year the team is
exceptionally strong. Top
swimmers include World Student
Games competitor Vicki Hays and
Malaysian Olympian Mai Ong. Sue
Trupin, Jackie Brink and Kathy
Heinze have made the National
cutoff times along with freshman
Nan Leuschel. These girls have
worked hard supplementing the
women's program by attending
the men's morning training
sessions under coaches Jim
Gaughran and Jeff Hammett.
Two weeks ago Stanford
hosted an invitational swimming
meet in which we had a 200 yard
freestyle relay place sth, just
slipping under the National
qualifying standard for this event.
Two of the girls on this relay had
not previously qualified for the
Nationals in any other event.
The Women's Physical
