# 'JB' Plays Toyon
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
Although one of the most
powerful plays ever written, JB is
seldom performed either in or
outside of the University.
Directed by Gloria Kelley,
Stanford's production of the play
opened to a full house Thursday
night in Toyon Hall.
Written by Archibald
MacLeish, JB is the author's
Pulitzer Pr i ze - w in n ing
interpretation of the story of Job.
Basically a modernized morality
play, JB deals with three
symbolical levels that are
illustrated in the play by
split-level staging. Ground level,
for example, is the sphere of Job's
existence — the earth. A tall
scaffold off to the left houses Zuss
(a play on Zeus; God) and Nickles
(representative of money, the root
of all evil; Satan), and symbolizes
heaven. The third level is the
off-stage voice known in the play
as the prompter.
The two central figures in JB —
Zuss and Nickles — are
broken-down actors reduced to
selling balloons and popcorn in
white vendor's uniforms. As the
play opens, Zuss and Nickles are
jockeying for position by trying
to upstage each other. They climb
the scaffold and decide to "play
out" Job's story. This scene,
termed the prologue by MacLeish,
is filled with allusions to games.
Nickles describes the world as
"the dirty whirler, the toy top,"
and states that Zuss should play
God — "the part was written for
you." Through the prologue, the
relationship between Zuss and
Nickles is defined as one of
contrast between a dignified God
and his sardonic adversary.
The play-with-a-play format of
JB can be seen almost as a chain
reaction: Zuss and Nickles, by
playing God and Satan, control
J.B. The off-stage promptor,

although only occasionally heard
and never quite defined, controls
Zuss and Nickles.
The only character who is not
aware of his involvement in the
play is J.B. — the pawn, the
innocent — who is made to suffer
so that his suffering will enable
him to see God. This central irony
— that Job must suffer not to
prove himself, but rather to prove
God — is the essence of J.B.'s
triumph over God's Will.
It is J.B.'s forgiveness of God,
his repentance for guilt of which
he is innocent, that makes God's
victory over Satan a mockery —
"as though Job's suffering were
justified not by the will of God
but by Job's acceptance of God's
Will." God's victory is the ironic
equivalent of a pedler selling
air-filled balloons to children. As
Nickles puts it, "You win. God
always wins. Where did I put that
popcorn?"
The final ironic twist of JB
occurs when Satan, positive that
J.B. will not accept God's giving
back of everything He had
stripped from him throughout he
play, is proven wrong — "Tell me
how you play the end. Any man
was screwed as Job was!" J.B.'s
reply is the acceptance of an
unjust universe, an unjust God:
"He does not love. He Is."
The play is performed in
MacLeish's poetic rhymed verse
that strikes the audience almost as
an incantation. With occasional
dialectic diversions by the cast
(both an Eastern and a Southern
accent are effectively used in
different scenes), the verse was
both dynamic and profound.
Especially good performances
were James Mclnerny as Nickles,
Michael Sperberg as J. 8., and
Doug Bedard as Zuss. Just as
Milton's Mephistopheles,
MacLeish's Satan comes out on
top.

"the dirty whirler, the toy top,"
and states that Zuss should play
God — "the part was written for
you." Through the prologue, the
relationship between Zuss and
Nickles is defined as one of
contrast between a dignified God
and his sardonic adversary.
The play-with-a-play format of
JB can be seen almost as a chain
reaction: Zuss and Nickles, by
playing God and Satan, control
J.B. The off-stage promptor,

although only occasionally heard
and never quite defined, controls
Zuss and Nickles.
The only character who is not
aware of his involvement in the
play is J.B. — the pawn, the
innocent — who is made to suffer
so that his suffering will enable
him to see God. This central irony
— that Job must suffer not to
prove himself, but rather to prove
God — is the essence of J.B.'s
triumph over God's Will.
It is J.B.'s forgiveness of God,
his repentance for guilt of which
he is innocent, that makes God's
victory over Satan a mockery —
"as though Job's suffering were
justified not by the will of God
but by Job's acceptance of God's
Will." God's victory is the ironic
equivalent of a pedler selling
air-filled balloons to children. As
Nickles puts it, "You win. God
always wins. Where did I put that
popcorn?"
The final ironic twist of JB
occurs when Satan, positive that
J.B. will not accept God's giving
back of everything He had
stripped from him throughout he
play, is proven wrong — "Tell me
how you play the end. Any man
was screwed as Job was!" J.B.'s
reply is the acceptance of an
unjust universe, an unjust God:
"He does not love. He Is."
The play is performed in
MacLeish's poetic rhymed verse
that strikes the audience almost as
an incantation. With occasional
dialectic diversions by the cast
(both an Eastern and a Southern
accent are effectively used in
different scenes), the verse was
both dynamic and profound.
Especially good performances
were James Mclnerny as Nickles,
Michael Sperberg as J. 8., and
Doug Bedard as Zuss. Just as
Milton's Mephistopheles,
MacLeish's Satan comes out on
top.

Although one of the most

seldom performed either in or
outside of the University.

Written by Archibald
MacLeish, JB is the author's
Pulitzer Pr i ze - w in n ing
interpretation of the story of Job.
Basically a modernized morality
play, JB deals with three
symbolical levels that are
illustrated in the play by
split-level staging. Ground level,
for example, is the sphere of Job's
existence — the earth. A tall
scaffold off to the left houses Zuss
(a play on Zeus; God) and Nickles
(representative of money, the root
of all evil; Satan), and symbolizes
heaven. The third level is the
off-stage voice known in the play
as the prompter.
The two central figures in JB —
Zuss and Nickles — are
broken-down actors reduced to
selling balloons and popcorn in
white vendor's uniforms. As the
play opens, Zuss and Nickles are
jockeying for position by trying
to upstage each other. They climb
the scaffold and decide to "play
out" Job's story. This scene,
termed the prologue by MacLeish,
is filled with allusions to games.
