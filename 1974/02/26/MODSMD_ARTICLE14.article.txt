# 'Consort' Enchants Mem Chu Audience
## 
### MICHALE SAFFLE 
Filling Memorial Church with
the translucent beauty of
Medieval music last Friday night,
the Waverly Consort presented an
enchanting program of cantigas
and pilgrim songs that a capacity
audience thoroughly enjoyed.
Most of the Consort's numbers
were taken from Las Cantigas de
Santa Maria, a collection of verse
and music compiled (and possibly
partially composed) by the
thirteenth-century Castilian king
Alfonson X, "The Wise." Each of
the hundreds of cantigas tells, in
words and melody, the story of a
miracle attributed to the Blessed
Virgin Mary — some of which are
doubly charming in both their
wordly wisdom and religious
sincerity.
Such Medieval songs were

probably accompanied by
instruments, but no one today is
absolutely certain how it was
done. Waverly Consort members
solved this problem respectably
and entertainingly through the
imaginative, colorful use of
rebecs, recorders, portable organ,
psalteries, drums, handbells, and
such exotic delights as a small
tromba marina, also known as a
"nun's fiddle."
The concert opened in
near-darkness. From the rear of
the church the sound of bells and
recorders gradually swelled and
thickened as the Consor processed
to the front of the sanctuary,
singing the "Benedicamus
'Verbum Patris' " — a single and
wonderfully effective
introduction.
'Troubadour" James Selby's
prologue was followed by five
"Miracles of Holy Mary," each a
cantiga sung and played by
Consort members. Before each
verse narrator Selby told the story
of the following verse, while
instrumentalists accompanied
him.
This use of "background
music" may have offended purists
but the narration itself, if a bit
mannered at times, was enjoyable,
as was the music.
Jane Bryden, soprano, and
tenor John Humphrey both sang
exquisitely. Humphrey's warm,
rich voice blended beautifully
with instruments, and carried one
unaccompanied movingly.
Bryden's graceful pilgrim song, "O
Virgo Spendens," accompanied by
two descant recorders, was the
evening's musical high point for
me.
Five more cantigas formed the
second half of the program, which
featured as an interlude the
pilgrim songs "Laudemus
Virginem" and "Splendens
Ceptrigera" sung in canon, an
unusual and effective touch. The
devotional "Rosa das Roasa"
ended the program; for a moment
the audience hesitated, then
applauded vigorously — a fine
evening's entertainment.
