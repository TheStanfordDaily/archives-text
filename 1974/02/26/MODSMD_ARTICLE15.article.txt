# At S.F. Art Institute

SAN FRANCISCO — I must confess that I was a
bit apprehensive when 1 walked into the Diego
Rivera Gallery at the San Francisco Art Institute.
The last show I visited there was a pretentious
group show by a clique of incestuously tight friends
who seem to have wasted a lot of film shooting
bizarre stills of each other. They were intoxicated
with wide angle lenses and solarized effects. Result:
fatuous, slic and boring. Very Boring.
So, given my bias, I was pleased with each turn
around the room. The show now on exhibition got
better and better.
Color
It is a show about color. What a joy to see some
serious considerations of color. I was beginning to
think that color photography was still in the hands
of ex-Life photographers and the makers of
nauseating greeting cards. Each of the
photographers addressed the question of color with
thought and care, and a pleasing firmness and
idiom.
At one extreme was Bob May hew whose
photographs were abstract color studies, which
were created by filming light in motion, soft,
almost neon-like color on dark fields. He treats
light as a substance, not as a quality, defined
through color and texture. The movement creates
almost painterly strokes forming suggestions of
organic shapes, and yet his photos, with one
exception, never become photographs
masquerading as paintings. In fact, they were
exciting for the tension of playing along the
dividing line between painting and photography, all
the while holding to a photographic integrity.
Susan Shaw's portraits were a bit perplexing (I
frequently find portraits to be cryptic). They were
strangely ambivalent, lacking a certain character
examination, yet describing character through the
use of light and color. The difference can best be
stated perhaps as the difference between internal
revelation and external description.
One photograph, for instance, is a portrait of a
young woman seated on a plush sofa. Spatially, the
girl has equal billing with part of the sofa, a lamp
and a chest. The colors of the photo are garish: the
sofa is fuschia, flat almost plastic fuschia with a
blue color base. She is wearing pink stockings, also
with a strong blue base and that blue, carried to the
flesh tones gives her a mannequin look.
Red Rabbit Eyes
The lighting is full front and flat, producing the
red rabbit eyes trademark of instamatic snapshots,
something so easily corrected that I can only
assume that it was a conscious editorial decision by
Susan Shaw. The girl is slightly inhuman and static,
yet the picture is about her, the colors used are
based on an impression of her.
At the other extreme is a portrait of a young

man drinking a cup of coffee. His is the one
portrait in which action is implied. The rest arc
almost irritatingly posed. The colors are all in the
spectrum of brick, golden browns and ochres, much
the palette of the Flemish painters with the same
non-focused luminous quality. Again, the choice of
colors clearly stemmed from an impression of the
subject, but his character remains undefined.
The clown of the show was Peter Levitan. His
opening photograph, "No. 1. Yes Even You Can Do
Photo Realism" is a marvelous fun-house piece. One
large print of The Giant Camera (a small hut built
in the form of a box camera) had been cut into
twelve pieces, and mounted on treated but
unstretched canvas, with grid lines drawn separating
the sections, and the title written in almost childish
block letters around the outside edge. The joy of
the picture was in the levels of parody playing off
the serious comment amplifying and energizing like
spreading rings in a pond. A photograph which is a
physical parody of the school of photorealist
painters; the subject being a goof on his own media,
recorded in the Disney colors which are actually
the colors of the hut.
Essentially, Peter Levitan brings the
considerations of the space between the color
photo and a painting into his own private arena in
an equally private circus. His hand and wit are ever
apparent. The other photograph from his series
which struck me was a portrait titled "Mark Once
Dined With Andy Warhol." That is all that Mark is,
and it's an effective photograph. Mark has been
photographed on the top of a hill with San
Francisco spreading into the deep space behind
him, a perfect Warhol portrait. His eyes are shut,
with the hallmark dead face of a Warhol model, his
head loose on his shoulders. The photograph is a
tinted black and white photograph with only the
barest rinse of greyed colors. He is numbered: his
shirt collar is number five, his sweater is number
seven, his cheekbone is number nine, his forehead is
number ten. Mark is a coded reduction of one
event, a dinner with Andy Warhol, and he and his
numbered face comprise a good comment on
Warhol.
Peter Levitan's images tantalize with flickers of
questions pivotal to photography, and I say flickers
because he does not let you bog down in ponderous
consideration. His impish images jab constantly at
concept, succeed visually and function in the
context of the show as an excellent foil by drawing
out and amplifying qualities in all the other
photographs.
This is a well assembled show, small but
satisfying, and challenging to the eye. Most of th«
images are pleasing on a visceral level, and most
hint effectively at idea. Above all, it's thoroughly
enjoyable, and I encourage you to go before it
ends, February 28.
