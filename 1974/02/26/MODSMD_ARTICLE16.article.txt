# Choral Groups Give Concert
## 
### DANIEL V. ROBINSON 
A concert of choral music
conducted by DMA candidates in
choral music was given in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium this past
Friday night. Three different
choral groups were involved, the
Stanford Chorus, Chorale and
Choir.
Lloyd Maes and the Chorus led
off with a short, not terribly
rewarding work by J.S. Bach. Why
it was performed at the tempo of
a dirge I cannot imagine but
perhaps it was in order to
lengthen this somewhat abortive
work. It seemed a poor vehicle for
the demonstration of Maes' skills.
His conducting, at that tempo,
was ponderous and the
performance, dull. It was a further
disappointment not to have any
instrumental accompaniment to
this piece, particularly in light of
the instrument accompaniment
provided for the other pieces.
Vernon Sanders directed the
Chorus in a creditable
performance of one of the great

works of 20th century choral
music, Stravinsky's Symphony of
Psalms. This is a difficult work,
particularly for the
instrumentalists and one felt that
a bit more rehearsal would have
turned this performance into
something quite special. Mr.
Sanders displayed a fine
knowledge of the score and a
good control of the instruments.
The Chorus, however, as was true
during the Bach, sang with a very
immature tone, without real
feeling and with little attention to
detail.
As a result, the effect was not
entirely pleasant. Diction was so
bad that only the simplest of
words were intelligible. Small
nuances of dynamics and attack,
essential to the interpretation of
this piece, were generally lost. The
performance lacked that clarity,
punch, and drive so typical of
Stravinsky.
Just before intermission, the
Choir, under the direction of
William Graham sang part of the

Bruckner Mass in E minor. This
lush, late Romantic piece,
complete with its rather peculiar
woodwind and brass scoring, wu
well done. The sound of the choir
also betrays a considerable lack of
vocal expertise but there is no
point in belaboring the fact that
Stanford choruses receive inept
and inadequate vocal instruction.
Mr. Graham seemed to have
caught completely the spirit of his
piece and the choir transmitted it
quite faithfully.
Second on the program but
from my point of view the
highlight of the evening was the
performance by the Choral of
Three Shakespeare Songs by
Ralph Vaughan Williams. Patricia
Farris displayed a real mastery of
every feature of the score with
which she was working and an
exceptional rapport with her
singers. Both in the fast and slow
sections Farris exhibited such a
complete control of rhythm and
dynamics that the minor lapses of
tone, pitch and diction were
scarcely noticeable. If the
members of the Chorale leam to
listen to each other and continue
to receive such fine direction,
they will become quite a good
group.
It was most enjoyable to see
four young conductors being
given a chance to prove
themselves in public. These four
generally acquitted themselves
well. Let us hope to see more such
programs in the future.

punch, and drive so typical of
Stravinsky.
Just before intermission, the
Choir, under the direction of
William Graham sang part of the

Bruckner Mass in E minor. This
lush, late Romantic piece,
complete with its rather peculiar
woodwind and brass scoring, wu
well done. The sound of the choir
also betrays a considerable lack of
vocal expertise but there is no
point in belaboring the fact that
Stanford choruses receive inept
and inadequate vocal instruction.
Mr. Graham seemed to have
caught completely the spirit of his
piece and the choir transmitted it
quite faithfully.
Second on the program but
from my point of view the
highlight of the evening was the
performance by the Choral of
Three Shakespeare Songs by
Ralph Vaughan Williams. Patricia
Farris displayed a real mastery of
every feature of the score with
which she was working and an
exceptional rapport with her
singers. Both in the fast and slow
sections Farris exhibited such a
complete control of rhythm and
dynamics that the minor lapses of
tone, pitch and diction were
scarcely noticeable. If the
members of the Chorale leam to
listen to each other and continue
to receive such fine direction,
they will become quite a good
group.
It was most enjoyable to see
four young conductors being
given a chance to prove
themselves in public. These four
generally acquitted themselves
well. Let us hope to see more such
programs in the future.
A concert of choral music
conducted by DMA candidates in
choral music was given in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium this past
Friday night. Three different
choral groups were involved, the
Stanford Chorus, Chorale and
Choir.
Lloyd Maes and the Chorus led
off with a short, not terribly
rewarding work by J.S. Bach. Why
it was performed at the tempo of
a dirge I cannot imagine but
perhaps it was in order to
lengthen this somewhat abortive
work. It seemed a poor vehicle for
the demonstration of Maes' skills.
His conducting, at that tempo,
was ponderous and the
performance, dull. It was a further
disappointment not to have any
instrumental accompaniment to
this piece, particularly in light of
the instrument accompaniment
provided for the other pieces.
Vernon Sanders directed the
Chorus in a creditable
performance of one of the great

works of 20th century choral
music, Stravinsky's Symphony of
Psalms. This is a difficult work,
particularly for the
instrumentalists and one felt that
a bit more rehearsal would have
turned this performance into
something quite special. Mr.
Sanders displayed a fine
knowledge of the score and a
good control of the instruments.
The Chorus, however, as was true
during the Bach, sang with a very
immature tone, without real
feeling and with little attention to
detail.
As a result, the effect was not
entirely pleasant. Diction was so
bad that only the simplest of
words were intelligible. Small
nuances of dynamics and attack,
essential to the interpretation of
this piece, were generally lost. The
performance lacked that clarity,
punch, and drive so typical of
Stravinsky.
