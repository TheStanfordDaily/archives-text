# 'Tonight at 8:30'
## ACT Musicals Go Downhill 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
Tonight at 8:30, a trio of one-acts by Noel
Coward and the latest addition to the
American Conservatory Theatre's repertoire,
opens with a witty word of explanation by
the playwright. Coward's "voice" over the
p.a. system acknowledges a certain lack of
social consciousness in his plays and remarks
ti.-at he has kept it all these years "in my
linen closet, just under my silk sheets."
Unfortunately, the evening entertainment
was all downhill from there.
ACT has chosen three musicals from the
nine short plays which compose Tonight at
8:30, written in 1935 as acting, singing, and
c* ncing vehicles for stars Gertrude Larence
and Coward.
Opening night's first vehicle was "Shadow
Play;" it has lost a bit of velocity over the
years which the current vogue for nostalgia
was unable to replace. It deals with the
marital difficulties of an urbane, high society
couple who wittily discuss their
extracurricular affairs and sentimentally
reminisce about their early days in love.
Coward called it musical fantasy. "It is a
pleasant theatrical device which gave Gertie
and me a chance to sing as romantically as we
could, dance in the moonlight and, we
hoped, convince the audience that we were
v»ry fascinating indeed."
Wincing At The Pitch
Elizabeth Huddle and Paul Shenar's
performance as the couple left one terribly
unconvinced. Fine actors though they are,
neither is a singer, as was all too painfully

evident when they sang in unison — sort of.
Shenar was consistently flat and Huddle
wasn't consistently anything. Although it is
vastly preferable to have on stage an actor
who is not a singer rather than vice versa, the
singing and dancing in this case often broke
the tender mood established by the acting.
One cannot be carried away with romantic
sentimentality when one is wincing at the
pitch.
The second part of Tonight, entitled
"Family Album," replaced the "star system"
format with group playing and, not at all
coincidentally, it was a marked improvement.
Calling to the fore those subtleties of timing
and ensemble that only a repertoire company
can offer, director Edward Hastings created a
wonderfully satirical portrait of a
hypocritical Victorian family in mourning
after the death of their opulent and
oppressive patriarch. The acting is suitably
stylized and uniformly strong throughout.
The singing has the advantage of small choral
proportions — as a group ACT is quite
competent musically, it is in the exposed
parts that the performance suffers. A notable
exception is the lovely Deborah May, whose
voice belongs legitimately in musicals. The
stage ultimately belonged to Raye Birk for
his superbly comic Burrows the butler.
"Family Album" was the best of the three.
'Red Peppers'
The program closed with "Red Peppers,"
"a vaudeville sketch sandwiched in between
two parodies of music-hall songs." Charles
Hallahan and Judith Knaiz played Mr. and

Mrs. Pepper, a song and dance comedy team
touring the second rate variety hall circuit. It
was glorious to see these long-time
supporting actors shine in a spotlight
performance of their own. Earl Boen's tipsily
inebriated conductor, Bert Bentley, was a
masterful touch. The singing and dancing
here did not detract from the acting — it was
delightfully comic and for the first time one
didn't have to dread the introduction to a
song for fear of what might follow.
"Shadow Play" was particularly
resplendant in its scenic effects — the
shadows of a garden, the reflection of light
from a Venitian canal — as was "Family
Album" in its rich Victorian costumes of
mourning. And a word must be said of the
fine orchestral combo in accompaniment:
Bravo!
ACT's Tonight at 8:30 is sprinkled with
bright moments, but it is below the
company's usual standards in both script and
performance. Noel Coward's forte is his
inimitable wit and he will be remembered for
his success in the genre of high comedy. His
efforts at the musical, especially the
sentimental musical, provided exquisite
entertainment for his contemporaries, but
the scripts have suffered in the ultimate test
of time. ACT's cast is abundantly talented,
but they have stepped beyond their realm of
expertise: musicals are simply not their stvle.
On the whole Tonight makes for a
diverting but disappointing evening. One
leaves this program of Coward craving more
wit and less music.

ACT has chosen three musicals from the
nine short plays which compose Tonight at
8:30, written in 1935 as acting, singing, and
c* ncing vehicles for stars Gertrude Larence
and Coward.
Opening night's first vehicle was "Shadow
Play;" it has lost a bit of velocity over the
years which the current vogue for nostalgia
was unable to replace. It deals with the
marital difficulties of an urbane, high society
couple who wittily discuss their
extracurricular affairs and sentimentally
reminisce about their early days in love.
Coward called it musical fantasy. "It is a
pleasant theatrical device which gave Gertie
and me a chance to sing as romantically as we
could, dance in the moonlight and, we
hoped, convince the audience that we were
v»ry fascinating indeed."
Wincing At The Pitch
Elizabeth Huddle and Paul Shenar's
performance as the couple left one terribly
unconvinced. Fine actors though they are,
neither is a singer, as was all too painfully

evident when they sang in unison — sort of.
Shenar was consistently flat and Huddle
wasn't consistently anything. Although it is
vastly preferable to have on stage an actor
who is not a singer rather than vice versa, the
singing and dancing in this case often broke
the tender mood established by the acting.
One cannot be carried away with romantic
sentimentality when one is wincing at the
pitch.
The second part of Tonight, entitled
"Family Album," replaced the "star system"
format with group playing and, not at all
coincidentally, it was a marked improvement.
Calling to the fore those subtleties of timing
and ensemble that only a repertoire company
can offer, director Edward Hastings created a
wonderfully satirical portrait of a
hypocritical Victorian family in mourning
after the death of their opulent and
oppressive patriarch. The acting is suitably
stylized and uniformly strong throughout.
The singing has the advantage of small choral
proportions — as a group ACT is quite
competent musically, it is in the exposed
parts that the performance suffers. A notable
exception is the lovely Deborah May, whose
voice belongs legitimately in musicals. The
stage ultimately belonged to Raye Birk for
his superbly comic Burrows the butler.
"Family Album" was the best of the three.
'Red Peppers'
The program closed with "Red Peppers,"
"a vaudeville sketch sandwiched in between
two parodies of music-hall songs." Charles
Hallahan and Judith Knaiz played Mr. and

Mrs. Pepper, a song and dance comedy team
touring the second rate variety hall circuit. It
was glorious to see these long-time
supporting actors shine in a spotlight
performance of their own. Earl Boen's tipsily
inebriated conductor, Bert Bentley, was a
masterful touch. The singing and dancing
here did not detract from the acting — it was
delightfully comic and for the first time one
didn't have to dread the introduction to a
song for fear of what might follow.
"Shadow Play" was particularly
resplendant in its scenic effects — the
shadows of a garden, the reflection of light
from a Venitian canal — as was "Family
Album" in its rich Victorian costumes of
mourning. And a word must be said of the
fine orchestral combo in accompaniment:
Bravo!
ACT's Tonight at 8:30 is sprinkled with
bright moments, but it is below the
company's usual standards in both script and
performance. Noel Coward's forte is his
inimitable wit and he will be remembered for
his success in the genre of high comedy. His
efforts at the musical, especially the
sentimental musical, provided exquisite
entertainment for his contemporaries, but
the scripts have suffered in the ultimate test
of time. ACT's cast is abundantly talented,
but they have stepped beyond their realm of
expertise: musicals are simply not their stvle.
On the whole Tonight makes for a
diverting but disappointing evening. One
leaves this program of Coward craving more
wit and less music.

Coward called it musical fantasy. "It is a
pleasant theatrical device which gave Gertie
and me a chance to sing as romantically as we
could, dance in the moonlight and, we
hoped, convince the audience that we were
v»ry fascinating indeed."
Wincing At The Pitch
Elizabeth Huddle and Paul Shenar's
performance as the couple left one terribly
unconvinced. Fine actors though they are,
neither is a singer, as was all too painfully

evident when they sang in unison — sort of.
Shenar was consistently flat and Huddle
wasn't consistently anything. Although it is
vastly preferable to have on stage an actor
who is not a singer rather than vice versa, the
singing and dancing in this case often broke
the tender mood established by the acting.
One cannot be carried away with romantic
sentimentality when one is wincing at the
pitch.
The second part of Tonight, entitled
"Family Album," replaced the "star system"
format with group playing and, not at all
coincidentally, it was a marked improvement.
Calling to the fore those subtleties of timing
and ensemble that only a repertoire company
can offer, director Edward Hastings created a
wonderfully satirical portrait of a
hypocritical Victorian family in mourning
after the death of their opulent and
oppressive patriarch. The acting is suitably
stylized and uniformly strong throughout.
The singing has the advantage of small choral
proportions — as a group ACT is quite
competent musically, it is in the exposed
parts that the performance suffers. A notable
exception is the lovely Deborah May, whose
voice belongs legitimately in musicals. The
stage ultimately belonged to Raye Birk for
his superbly comic Burrows the butler.
"Family Album" was the best of the three.
'Red Peppers'
The program closed with "Red Peppers,"
"a vaudeville sketch sandwiched in between
two parodies of music-hall songs." Charles
Hallahan and Judith Knaiz played Mr. and

Mrs. Pepper, a song and dance comedy team
touring the second rate variety hall circuit. It
was glorious to see these long-time
supporting actors shine in a spotlight
performance of their own. Earl Boen's tipsily
inebriated conductor, Bert Bentley, was a
masterful touch. The singing and dancing
here did not detract from the acting — it was
delightfully comic and for the first time one
didn't have to dread the introduction to a
song for fear of what might follow.
"Shadow Play" was particularly
resplendant in its scenic effects — the
shadows of a garden, the reflection of light
from a Venitian canal — as was "Family
Album" in its rich Victorian costumes of
mourning. And a word must be said of the
fine orchestral combo in accompaniment:
Bravo!
ACT's Tonight at 8:30 is sprinkled with
bright moments, but it is below the
company's usual standards in both script and
performance. Noel Coward's forte is his
inimitable wit and he will be remembered for
his success in the genre of high comedy. His
efforts at the musical, especially the
sentimental musical, provided exquisite
entertainment for his contemporaries, but
the scripts have suffered in the ultimate test
of time. ACT's cast is abundantly talented,
but they have stepped beyond their realm of
expertise: musicals are simply not their stvle.
On the whole Tonight makes for a
diverting but disappointing evening. One
leaves this program of Coward craving more
wit and less music.
