# Jenkins Enlivens Dance Scene

### JANICE ROSS 
SAN FRANCISCO — For years
New York City has been the
undisputed capital of the dance
world. Almost without exception
?" y dancer who wanted
professional training and
performing experience was forced
to emigrate to the big city.
Recently, however, the number
of competent dancers outside of
New York has been increasing; fed
up with the City or just interested
a change of scenery, they have
brought a new energy and sparkle
to the West Coast dance scene.
Foremost among these eastern
transplants in the Bay Area is
teacher-choreographer Margaret
Jenkins. Jenkins studied with
Merce Cunningham in New York
and'' 'danced in Gus Solomon's
danfce company, a
Cunningham-genre group. Her
studio in San Francisco has been a
focal point for Bay Area dancers
for several years, occasional
weekend performances
i pplementing the studio's daily
fare of technique classes.
At last Friday's studio
showing, Jenkins presented two
group dances, Selfsame and
Two-by-Four. Two-by-Four was a
remarkable and disconcerting
dance. These effects may have
L. en due in part to the reading of
some austere and ominous poems
that accompanied the dance, but
the movement was frantic,
seemingly disorganized and subtly
disquieting.
There was an unusual paring in
'his dance that is seldom found in
quartets. Throughout the dance
there were always two or three
centers of gravity constantly
pulling at one another. In one
section Jenkins and Michael
Schwartz performed a series of
intertwining lifts while the two
•ther women each performed
their own slow movement
sequence, oblivious to the goings
on of the other dancers.
Exemplifying the bizarre nature
of the movement were the series
of violent falls executed by
Schwartz, who threw himself on

the floor with a resounding crash
again and again.
Lines such as "The window is
open," and "You invent the end"
were delivered with a profound
urgency and repeated over and
over at different cadences
throughout the dance. At one
point two women spent a long
interval in each others arms,
rolling as one across the floor. At
the end of the dance one had the
feeling that something had really
been said although one wasn't
sure exactly what it was. The
black costumes and faint lighting
contributed to the strange
atmosphere.
Jenkins' dances embody the
familiar Cunningham notion that
the dance is a glimpse into an
ongoing process. The dancers
never begin and end with the rise
and fall of the curtain, instead, as
the lights go out, we see them still

moving, sort of like a fade out on a
rock and roll song.
Whereas the accompaniment in
Two-by-Four had a fragmenting
effect on the movement, the live
Bach Sonata accompanying
Selfsame had the effect of
knitting the extremely variable
movements into a rounded whole.
Selfsame is a large dance where
seven dancers all execute the same
patterns at varying intervals. The
effect was to overlay the dance
onto itself seven times, giving the
viewer in any instant a glimpse
through the seven layers of the
movement's time structure.
The dance became almost one
dimensional as the dimming of the
lights darkened the forefront of
the studio, and there was a
marvelous silhouette effect.
Selfsame, wasn't exciting like
Two-by-Four but it was extremely
intelligent, well-done, and pleasing

to watch.
The last portion of the
program consisted of a Series of
Solos, that faded into one
another. Jenkins choreographed
all five solos but remained faithful
to each dancer's personal
movement nuances.
One by one the
dancers moved into the center of
the studio, and began their
isolated movement sequences,
although intermittently another
dancer might pass through.
Jenkins has undoubtedly
distinguished herself as one of the
most talented and imaginative
choreographers enlivening the San
Francisco dance scene today.
Anyone interested in avant-garde
dance has a last chance this
weekend to see the Jenkins
dancers in action.

SAN FRANCISCO — For years
New York City has been the
undisputed capital of the dance
world. Almost without exception
?" y dancer who wanted
professional training and
performing experience was forced
to emigrate to the big city.
Recently, however, the number
of competent dancers outside of
New York has been increasing; fed
up with the City or just interested
a change of scenery, they have
brought a new energy and sparkle
to the West Coast dance scene.
Foremost among these eastern
transplants in the Bay Area is
teacher-choreographer Margaret
Jenkins. Jenkins studied with
Merce Cunningham in New York
and'' 'danced in Gus Solomon's
danfce company, a
Cunningham-genre group. Her
studio in San Francisco has been a
focal point for Bay Area dancers
for several years, occasional
weekend performances
i pplementing the studio's daily
fare of technique classes.
At last Friday's studio
showing, Jenkins presented two
group dances, Selfsame and
Two-by-Four. Two-by-Four was a
remarkable and disconcerting
dance. These effects may have
L. en due in part to the reading of
some austere and ominous poems
that accompanied the dance, but
the movement was frantic,
seemingly disorganized and subtly
disquieting.
There was an unusual paring in
'his dance that is seldom found in
quartets. Throughout the dance
there were always two or three
centers of gravity constantly
pulling at one another. In one
section Jenkins and Michael
Schwartz performed a series of
intertwining lifts while the two
•ther women each performed
their own slow movement
sequence, oblivious to the goings
on of the other dancers.
Exemplifying the bizarre nature
of the movement were the series
of violent falls executed by
Schwartz, who threw himself on

the floor with a resounding crash
again and again.
Lines such as "The window is
open," and "You invent the end"
were delivered with a profound
urgency and repeated over and
over at different cadences
throughout the dance. At one
point two women spent a long
interval in each others arms,
rolling as one across the floor. At
the end of the dance one had the
feeling that something had really
been said although one wasn't
sure exactly what it was. The
black costumes and faint lighting
contributed to the strange
atmosphere.
Jenkins' dances embody the
familiar Cunningham notion that
the dance is a glimpse into an
ongoing process. The dancers
never begin and end with the rise
and fall of the curtain, instead, as
the lights go out, we see them still

moving, sort of like a fade out on a
rock and roll song.
Whereas the accompaniment in
Two-by-Four had a fragmenting
effect on the movement, the live
Bach Sonata accompanying
Selfsame had the effect of
knitting the extremely variable
movements into a rounded whole.
Selfsame is a large dance where
seven dancers all execute the same
patterns at varying intervals. The
effect was to overlay the dance
onto itself seven times, giving the
viewer in any instant a glimpse
through the seven layers of the
movement's time structure.
The dance became almost one
dimensional as the dimming of the
lights darkened the forefront of
the studio, and there was a
marvelous silhouette effect.
Selfsame, wasn't exciting like
Two-by-Four but it was extremely
intelligent, well-done, and pleasing

to watch.
The last portion of the
program consisted of a Series of
Solos, that faded into one
another. Jenkins choreographed
all five solos but remained faithful
to each dancer's personal
movement nuances.
One by one the
dancers moved into the center of
the studio, and began their
isolated movement sequences,
although intermittently another
dancer might pass through.
Jenkins has undoubtedly
distinguished herself as one of the
most talented and imaginative
choreographers enlivening the San
Francisco dance scene today.
