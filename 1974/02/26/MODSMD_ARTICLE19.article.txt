Statewide Odd-Even Plan Set Up
LOS ANGELES — California will set up by Friday a gasoline
marketing plan that will permit purchases on an odd-even basis
according to license plates, Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday.
The plan could be imposed in any of the 58 counties in which
the board of supervisors requests it, the governor said at a news
conference.
Details of the plan will not be available until at least today and
perhaps not until tomorrow, said Edwin Meece 111, the governor's
executive assistant.
Reagan confirmed the plan would permit owners of cars with
even numbered license plates to buy gasoline on even-numbered
days and those with odd license plates to buy gasoline on
odd-numbered days. Everyone would be permitted to buy on the
31st of a month.
He said the plan would be mandatory and would encourage
dealers to remain open on Sundays. He said he didn't think that
would conflict with the President's request that stations stay
closed on Sundays because "that was made before there were any
other programs such as this."
Still, Reagan was unclear on a number of points — who would

enforce such a plan, would there be a maximum or minimum
purchase, what would happen if stations chose not to open on
Sundays.
Supply Problems Delay Food Program
HILLSBOROUGH — Supply problems will delay the massive
food giveaway aimed at obtaining the release of kidnaped
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, organizer A. Ludlow Kramer
said yesterday.
Meantime, the Randolph A. Hearst family continued its tense
vigil with no word on whether the terrorist-demanded $6 million
food handout will satisfy the Symbionese Liberation Army which
claims to hold Patricia as a "prisoner of war."
A family spokesman said Hearst planned no further public
comment until he receives a new communique from the armed
guerrilla group which called Hearst a "corporate enemy of the
people."
At a news conference 15 miles north in San Francisco,
Kramer, secretary of state in Washington State, said, "Since
high-quality food as outlined in the SLA demands cannot be
purchased by tomorrow, we will not open on Tuesday." He said
he hoped it would resume Thursday.
Kramer said People in Need has to obtain more fresh meat and
vegetables and more distribution sites before it can begin handing
out food again.
"If People In Need were to proceed against the demands of the
SLA at this time, we are convinced further disorders would occur
and the SLA requirement of food distribution in a dignified
manner would never be achieved," Kramer said.
Nixon's Former Lawyer Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON — Herbert W. Kalmbach, a corporation lawyer
who handled President Nixon's personal legal affairs, pleaded
guilty yesterday to two charges stemming from his political
fund-raising in 1970.
One count was a technical violation of the Federal Corrupt
Practices Act. The other accused Kalmbach of promising an
ambassador a better post in return for a $100,000 contribution.
Kalmbach could be sentenced to a maximum three years and
$11,000 on the two charges.

In return for the guilty pleas and Kalmbach's pledge to testify
against others, the government promised not to prosecute him in
the Watergate coverup or in future political contributions cases.
The 52-year-old Kalmbach admitted to the Senate Watergate
Committee last year that he raised $220,000 that was then passed
to the defendants in the Watergate break-in. But he denied any
knowledge that the money was to buy the conspirators' silence.
The charges to which he pleaded concern fund-raising activities
in 1970 when Republicans were making a major effort to elect
GOP senators and representatives.
Foster Case Defendants Deny Guilt
OAKLAND — Two Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
pleaded innocent yesterday to murder charges in the slaying of
School Supt. Marcus Foster.
Municipal Court Judge Stafford P. Buckley ordered Joseph
Remiro, 27, and Russell Little, 24, to appear April 1 for a
preliminary hearing.
Both men, termed SLA soldiers in communications from the
terrorist group, also pleaded innocent to attempted murder in the
wounding of assistant school chief Robert Blackburn in the same
ambush Nov. 6.
Defense attorneys filed 21 discovery motions at the
arraignment, the fourth court appearence here for Little and
Remiro.
One motion asked for reports of ballistics tests on the
.380-caliber Walther automatic pistol police said Remiro was
carrying at his arrest Jan. 16. The cyanide-loaded bullets that cut
down Foster outside the Oakland school administration building
came from that gun, police experts said.
Buckley gave the prosecution until tomorrow to give the
defense results of the ballistics. He indicated he would rule on
other motions April 1.
Today's Weather

to the defendants in the Watergate break-in. But he denied any
knowledge that the money was to buy the conspirators' silence.
The charges to which he pleaded concern fund-raising activities
in 1970 when Republicans were making a major effort to elect
GOP senators and representatives.
Foster Case Defendants Deny Guilt
OAKLAND — Two Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
pleaded innocent yesterday to murder charges in the slaying of
School Supt. Marcus Foster.
Municipal Court Judge Stafford P. Buckley ordered Joseph
Remiro, 27, and Russell Little, 24, to appear April 1 for a
preliminary hearing.
Both men, termed SLA soldiers in communications from the
terrorist group, also pleaded innocent to attempted murder in the
wounding of assistant school chief Robert Blackburn in the same
ambush Nov. 6.
Defense attorneys filed 21 discovery motions at the
arraignment, the fourth court appearence here for Little and
Remiro.
One motion asked for reports of ballistics tests on the
.380-caliber Walther automatic pistol police said Remiro was
carrying at his arrest Jan. 16. The cyanide-loaded bullets that cut
down Foster outside the Oakland school administration building
came from that gun, police experts said.
Buckley gave the prosecution until tomorrow to give the
defense results of the ballistics. He indicated he would rule on
other motions April 1.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness with chance of light rain through
tonight. Partly cloudy tomorrow. Lows tonight in 40s. Highs
today and tomorrow in mid 50s to low 60s. Variable wind 5 to
15 mph. Chance of rain 30 percent today and 20 percent tonight.
Statewide Odd-Even Plan Set Up
LOS ANGELES — California will set up by Friday a gasoline
marketing plan that will permit purchases on an odd-even basis
according to license plates, Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday.
The plan could be imposed in any of the 58 counties in which
the board of supervisors requests it, the governor said at a news
conference.
Details of the plan will not be available until at least today and
perhaps not until tomorrow, said Edwin Meece 111, the governor's
executive assistant.
Reagan confirmed the plan would permit owners of cars with
even numbered license plates to buy gasoline on even-numbered
days and those with odd license plates to buy gasoline on
odd-numbered days. Everyone would be permitted to buy on the
31st of a month.
He said the plan would be mandatory and would encourage
dealers to remain open on Sundays. He said he didn't think that
would conflict with the President's request that stations stay
closed on Sundays because "that was made before there were any
other programs such as this."
Still, Reagan was unclear on a number of points — who would

enforce such a plan, would there be a maximum or minimum
purchase, what would happen if stations chose not to open on
Sundays.
Supply Problems Delay Food Program
HILLSBOROUGH — Supply problems will delay the massive
food giveaway aimed at obtaining the release of kidnaped
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, organizer A. Ludlow Kramer
said yesterday.
Meantime, the Randolph A. Hearst family continued its tense
vigil with no word on whether the terrorist-demanded $6 million
food handout will satisfy the Symbionese Liberation Army which
claims to hold Patricia as a "prisoner of war."
A family spokesman said Hearst planned no further public
comment until he receives a new communique from the armed
guerrilla group which called Hearst a "corporate enemy of the
people."
At a news conference 15 miles north in San Francisco,
Kramer, secretary of state in Washington State, said, "Since
high-quality food as outlined in the SLA demands cannot be
purchased by tomorrow, we will not open on Tuesday." He said
he hoped it would resume Thursday.
Kramer said People in Need has to obtain more fresh meat and
vegetables and more distribution sites before it can begin handing
out food again.
"If People In Need were to proceed against the demands of the
SLA at this time, we are convinced further disorders would occur
and the SLA requirement of food distribution in a dignified
manner would never be achieved," Kramer said.
Nixon's Former Lawyer Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON — Herbert W. Kalmbach, a corporation lawyer
who handled President Nixon's personal legal affairs, pleaded
guilty yesterday to two charges stemming from his political
fund-raising in 1970.
One count was a technical violation of the Federal Corrupt
Practices Act. The other accused Kalmbach of promising an
ambassador a better post in return for a $100,000 contribution.
Kalmbach could be sentenced to a maximum three years and
$11,000 on the two charges.

In return for the guilty pleas and Kalmbach's pledge to testify
against others, the government promised not to prosecute him in
the Watergate coverup or in future political contributions cases.
The 52-year-old Kalmbach admitted to the Senate Watergate
Committee last year that he raised $220,000 that was then passed

food handout will satisfy the Symbionese Liberation Army which
claims to hold Patricia as a "prisoner of war."
A family spokesman said Hearst planned no further public
comment until he receives a new communique from the armed
guerrilla group which called Hearst a "corporate enemy of the
people."
At a news conference 15 miles north in San Francisco,
Kramer, secretary of state in Washington State, said, "Since
high-quality food as outlined in the SLA demands cannot be
purchased by tomorrow, we will not open on Tuesday." He said
he hoped it would resume Thursday.
Kramer said People in Need has to obtain more fresh meat and
vegetables and more distribution sites before it can begin handing
out food again.
"If People In Need were to proceed against the demands of the
SLA at this time, we are convinced further disorders would occur
and the SLA requirement of food distribution in a dignified
manner would never be achieved," Kramer said.
Nixon's Former Lawyer Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON — Herbert W. Kalmbach, a corporation lawyer
who handled President Nixon's personal legal affairs, pleaded
guilty yesterday to two charges stemming from his political
fund-raising in 1970.
One count was a technical violation of the Federal Corrupt
Practices Act. The other accused Kalmbach of promising an
ambassador a better post in return for a $100,000 contribution.
Kalmbach could be sentenced to a maximum three years and
$11,000 on the two charges.

In return for the guilty pleas and Kalmbach's pledge to testify
against others, the government promised not to prosecute him in
the Watergate coverup or in future political contributions cases.
The 52-year-old Kalmbach admitted to the Senate Watergate
Committee last year that he raised $220,000 that was then passed
to the defendants in the Watergate break-in. But he denied any
knowledge that the money was to buy the conspirators' silence.
The charges to which he pleaded concern fund-raising activities
in 1970 when Republicans were making a major effort to elect
GOP senators and representatives.
Foster Case Defendants Deny Guilt
OAKLAND — Two Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
pleaded innocent yesterday to murder charges in the slaying of
School Supt. Marcus Foster.
Municipal Court Judge Stafford P. Buckley ordered Joseph
Remiro, 27, and Russell Little, 24, to appear April 1 for a
preliminary hearing.
Both men, termed SLA soldiers in communications from the
terrorist group, also pleaded innocent to attempted murder in the
wounding of assistant school chief Robert Blackburn in the same
ambush Nov. 6.
Defense attorneys filed 21 discovery motions at the
arraignment, the fourth court appearence here for Little and
Remiro.
One motion asked for reports of ballistics tests on the
.380-caliber Walther automatic pistol police said Remiro was
carrying at his arrest Jan. 16. The cyanide-loaded bullets that cut
down Foster outside the Oakland school administration building
came from that gun, police experts said.
Buckley gave the prosecution until tomorrow to give the
defense results of the ballistics. He indicated he would rule on
other motions April 1.

Statewide Odd-Even Plan Set Up
LOS ANGELES — California will set up by Friday a gasoline
marketing plan that will permit purchases on an odd-even basis
according to license plates, Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday.
The plan could be imposed in any of the 58 counties in which
the board of supervisors requests it, the governor said at a news
conference.
Details of the plan will not be available until at least today and
perhaps not until tomorrow, said Edwin Meece 111, the governor's
executive assistant.
Reagan confirmed the plan would permit owners of cars with
even numbered license plates to buy gasoline on even-numbered
days and those with odd license plates to buy gasoline on
odd-numbered days. Everyone would be permitted to buy on the
31st of a month.
He said the plan would be mandatory and would encourage
dealers to remain open on Sundays. He said he didn't think that
would conflict with the President's request that stations stay
closed on Sundays because "that was made before there were any
other programs such as this."
Still, Reagan was unclear on a number of points — who would

enforce such a plan, would there be a maximum or minimum
purchase, what would happen if stations chose not to open on
Sundays.
Supply Problems Delay Food Program
HILLSBOROUGH — Supply problems will delay the massive
food giveaway aimed at obtaining the release of kidnaped
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, organizer A. Ludlow Kramer
said yesterday.
