# Campus GOP Group Takes Liberal Views
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The Republican Party can survive as
a viable political force only if it
nominates progressive candidates,
according to members of the Stanford
chapter of the California Republican
League (CRL).
"The CRL group formed here
because we needed an organization to
present the liberal Republican
viewpoint on campus," stated Luis
Buhler, one of the chapter's 37
members. "This is the time for
progressive Republicans to get
involved in the party. There is a
vacuum of leadership and liberals have
the chance to fill that vacuum."
Although there is another
Republican group on campus, the
Young Republicans (YR), some
members of the CRL claim that the
YR presents a more right-wing image.
"The YR is a national organization
that receives its money from [the
group's headquarters in] Washington,"
said Mike Byrd, a history major who
belongs to the CRL. "[The YR's]
members are more conservative than I
would care to be," Byrd stated.
He added that the only hope for
he Republican Party is for it to
nominate progressive candidates.
Bad Portent
Chuck Bell, a third-year law student
who serves as chairman of Stanford's
CRL, noted that "Watergate hurts all
Republican organizations." He
admitted that the recent election of a
Democrat to a congressional seat in
Michigan that had been held by a
Republican since 1910 is a bad portent
for the party.
"The voters are trying to express
distaste for the whole Watergate
affair," Bell said. "Since they can't
vote against Nixon, they register their
discontent by voting against
Republican candidates."
"We've had some problems with
people equating Watergate with the
Republican Party," according to
Kathy Batts, a senior communication
major who belongs to the CRL. "At
the campaign table [in White Plaza)
people sometimes express interest in a
candidate but walk away when I tell
them he is a Republican."
Despite Watergate, Bell has found
considerable support for the
Republican Party on campus since the
CRL chapter formed here last spring.
Bell claimed that the CRL now has a
larger membership than the YR. Some
students belong to both groups.

The Stanford CRL has not formed
any position on the impeachment
issue, Buhler stated. A meeting was
held to discuss the issue and members
ranged in opinion from unconditional
support for Nixon to advocacy of his
removal from office.
Local Concern
"Impeachment is not a divisive
issue for us because we are more
concerned with local matters," Buhler
stated. Although the CRL has made no
endorsements, almost all of its
members are active in the campaigns
of local Republicans.
CRL chapters from throughout the
state will convene in San Francisco
this spring. The chapters will then
endorse candidates for the Republican
nominations, with each local chapter
casting as many votes as it has
members.
Bell said that he is encouraged that
so many young, progressive candidates
are seeking nominations. "If the party
can change and present to the voters a
new perspective and a younger
approach to problems, it has a chance
to do very well in the state elections
next fall," he said.
Being a progressive Republican in a
largely conservative party can present
certain problems, Buhler admitted.
Right-Wing Demos
"Every liberal Republican must ask
himself if he is suited for the
Republican Party," Buhler stated.
"But there are many right-wing
Democrats and I could never be a
conservative Democrat," Buhler
explained.
Buhler belongs to the GOP for
philosophical reasons. "'I believe that
the most effective government is
closest to the people. Power should
rest with local and state governments."
Buhler said that he believes that the
Republicans better support this ideal
than do the Democrats.
Although Buhler conceded that at
times the federal government must
intervene in local affairs — as it has
done in recent years to promote racial
equality — he feels the Democrats
believe in a government that is too
centralized and powerful.
"When you are joining an
organization as big as the GOP, there is
no way that you can agree with
everyone in the group," Buhler
remarked. "But you can get involved
and point the party in the direction
that you want it to go."
The Republican Party can survive as
a viable political force only if it
nominates progressive candidates,
according to members of the Stanford

nominations, with each local chapter
casting as many votes as it has
members.
Bell said that he is encouraged that
so many young, progressive candidates
are seeking nominations. "If the party
can change and present to the voters a
new perspective and a younger
approach to problems, it has a chance
to do very well in the state elections
next fall," he said.
Being a progressive Republican in a
largely conservative party can present
certain problems, Buhler admitted.
Right-Wing Demos
"Every liberal Republican must ask
himself if he is suited for the
Republican Party," Buhler stated.
"But there are many right-wing
Democrats and I could never be a
conservative Democrat," Buhler
explained.
Buhler belongs to the GOP for
philosophical reasons. "'I believe that
the most effective government is
closest to the people. Power should
rest with local and state governments."
Buhler said that he believes that the
Republicans better support this ideal
than do the Democrats.
Although Buhler conceded that at
times the federal government must
intervene in local affairs — as it has
done in recent years to promote racial
equality — he feels the Democrats
believe in a government that is too
centralized and powerful.
"When you are joining an
organization as big as the GOP, there is
no way that you can agree with
everyone in the group," Buhler
remarked. "But you can get involved
and point the party in the direction
that you want it to go."
The Republican Party can survive as
a viable political force only if it
nominates progressive candidates,
according to members of the Stanford
chapter of the California Republican
League (CRL).
"The CRL group formed here
because we needed an organization to
present the liberal Republican
viewpoint on campus," stated Luis
Buhler, one of the chapter's 37
members. "This is the time for
progressive Republicans to get
involved in the party. There is a
vacuum of leadership and liberals have
the chance to fill that vacuum."
Although there is another
Republican group on campus, the
Young Republicans (YR), some
members of the CRL claim that the
YR presents a more right-wing image.
"The YR is a national organization
that receives its money from [the
group's headquarters in] Washington,"
said Mike Byrd, a history major who
belongs to the CRL. "[The YR's]
members are more conservative than I
would care to be," Byrd stated.
He added that the only hope for
he Republican Party is for it to
nominate progressive candidates.
Bad Portent
Chuck Bell, a third-year law student
who serves as chairman of Stanford's
CRL, noted that "Watergate hurts all
Republican organizations." He
admitted that the recent election of a
Democrat to a congressional seat in
Michigan that had been held by a
Republican since 1910 is a bad portent
for the party.
"The voters are trying to express
distaste for the whole Watergate
affair," Bell said. "Since they can't
vote against Nixon, they register their
discontent by voting against
Republican candidates."
"We've had some problems with
people equating Watergate with the
Republican Party," according to
Kathy Batts, a senior communication
major who belongs to the CRL. "At
the campaign table [in White Plaza)
people sometimes express interest in a
candidate but walk away when I tell
them he is a Republican."
Despite Watergate, Bell has found
considerable support for the
Republican Party on campus since the
CRL chapter formed here last spring.
Bell claimed that the CRL now has a
larger membership than the YR. Some
students belong to both groups.

The Stanford CRL has not formed
any position on the impeachment
issue, Buhler stated. A meeting was
held to discuss the issue and members
ranged in opinion from unconditional
support for Nixon to advocacy of his
removal from office.
Local Concern
"Impeachment is not a divisive
issue for us because we are more
concerned with local matters," Buhler
stated. Although the CRL has made no
endorsements, almost all of its
members are active in the campaigns
of local Republicans.
CRL chapters from throughout the
state will convene in San Francisco
this spring. The chapters will then
endorse candidates for the Republican
nominations, with each local chapter
