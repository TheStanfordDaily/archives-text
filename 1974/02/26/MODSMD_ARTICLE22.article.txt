# Psoriasis Day Care Begins
## 
### 
Medical Center News Bureau
The first hospital-based
psoriasis day care center in the
country opened last week at
Stanford University Medical
Center to provide inpatient care at
outpatient convenience for those
with psoriasis.
This innovative center, located
at Stanford University Hospital's
Hoover Pavilion on Quarry Road,
enables patients to receive the
treatment they need during the
day and return to their families
each evening. It is the beginning
of an effort by Stanford
dermatologists to make health
care more available to the general
population.
Director of the center is Dr.
Eugene Farber, professor and
chairman of the Department of
Dermatology at the School of
Medicine and a leading authority
on psoriasis. Dr. William Watson,
assistant professor of
dermatology, is associate director.
Psoriasis, a common skin
disorder that causes itching,
scaling and redness, affects an
estimated 6 million people in the
United States alone. While no
permanent cure is yet known,
applications of appropriate salves
provide effective control.
The majority of patients do
not require hospitalization, but
for the 5 to 10 percent who do,
the average hospital stay is two or
four weeks, says Farber. Another
10 percent with psoriasis on one
quarter to one half of their bodies
can benefit from a day care
center where they can receive
intensive therapy.
