## Avoiding The $15 An Hour Blues 
### WILLIAM EUPHRAT 
Millions of Americans own cameras, yet very few know
much about camera maintenance. Cameras are extremely
delicate and complicated machines, and if they are not
kept in good shape, the repair costs can be quite high. In a
simple range-finder camera, there can be as many as 50
electrical components and 250 mechanical parts — which
makes it somewhat understandable that repair shops
charge an average of $15 per hour.
If for some reason you should have trouble with your
camera, don't try to fix it yourself. If your camera really
needs repair, it's generally impossible to escape a relatively
high bill, but trying to repair your camera at home will
only get you into further trouble: a job that would have
cost $10 will probably end up at around $30, and it's very
easy to lose small but expensive parts.
Your camera, however, need never see the inside of a
repair shop if you take regular care of it and treat it with
respect.
Cheap Insurance
First of all, always use a neck strap: it's very cheap
insurance, since dropping your camera is a wonderful way
to cause permanent damage. If you have a strap, check it
periodically for signs of wear. It is best to use a leather or
cloth strap; a plastic one can snap in very cold weather.
The camera shutter should never be left cocked for long
periods of time. If the springs are kept taut for too long,
they may give out when you resume use.For cameras such
as Hasselblads and Mirandas with the shutter in the lens,
be sure to trip it when you remove it.
Cleaning the lens is also very important. A dirty front
element will not only make for bad pictures, but cleaning
it the wrong way may eventually grind the protective
coating off. A good solution to use is reagent grade
methanol applied with Q-tips. For removing dust a soft
nylon bristle paint brush and compressed air will do quite
nicely.
Filters For Protection
There are two reasons for using a UV or skylight filter.
Not only will it give you better pictures, but it will also
protect the front element of your lens. Use it especially
when there is a danger of small rocks being thrown by

cars, or salt water getting on the front element. They will
also protect the lens from the oil on your hands that can
be transfered by everyday use.
Plastic lens caps will help too. Remember to use them
faithfully. In order not to lose the cap, burn a hole in it
with a hot needle and attach a rubber band to the cap and
camera; that way it will never be left behind.
Keep It Clean v
It's a good idea to periodically clean the inside of your
camera with a soft nylon brush and compressed air.
"Omit" is very good for this as the flow of air is quite soft.
Anything too hard may blow a hole in the cloth shutter,
so be careful. (Film chips are an excellent example of why
you should clean your camera. If you come to the end of a
roll too suddenly and rip out the perforations you will
leave small film chips in the camera. The chips will
eventually work their way into the slow speed gear chain
causing the camera to jam. Cleaning your camera can
prevent this. As an example, a Nikon that has not been in
the shop for an overhaul for about 2V4 years and has
around 5 rolls of film going through it every week will cost
$40-50 to fix if film chips jam it.)
Never touch the pressure plate on the back of the
camera. The dirt and oil from your fingers will form a
goop on the plate that will make the film stick as it
advances. It's a good idea to clean the pressure plate with
reagent grade methanol and Q-tips. Nor should you touch
the film guides. They are unpainted and can be ruined very
quickly, as they have no protection at all.
Also, leave the mirror alone. Most mirrors have silver on
the surface and everytime you touch them or try to clean
them you rub off some of the silver, and after a while you
will notice that the image in the viewfinder is not as bright
as it used to be. Normal cost for a new mirror is $12, plus
$18 labor, so just leave it alone.
Cameras, Hot and Otherwise
One must be very careful of hot cameras, stolen or
otherwise. In the Bay Area, it's estimated that a camera
can be fenced within three hours. In case your camera is
stolen, copy down the serial number for future
identification. You can also engrave your drivers license
number on the main chassis. You still may not ever

recover your cahiera, but if you don't do at least one of
these two things jrou will never recover your camera.
Cameras left in the hot sun will cause the focus mount
grease to melt and run down the lens barrel to the iris
blades. The damage is not immediately noticeable, but
when the grease hardens again it will glue the iris blades
together.
If this happens you will be unable to stop down the
diaphragm and may cause extra damage when you click
the shutter, as the blades won't move. If this happens the
iris blades will have to be replaced, another expensive
operation. Iris blades in good condition should be dry and
have a snappy action. A good rule of thumb is, don't put
your camera any place you wouldn't want to be. A
comfortable temperature range is 32°-85°.
CI unitized
If you plan on visiting the desert or artic regions your
camera can be climitized to the weather. If your camera is
unclimitized, safe exposure to the elements depends on
how long it is left out.
It is also necessary to remember that if you come from
the cold into a humid and hot room, condensation will
form on the outside and inside of your camera, causing
rust to form. To prevent condensation, put your camera in
a plastic bag.
If you have not used your camera in a long time, be
sure to warm it up by working all the moving parts. If it
sits in one position for a long time the lubricant oils will
settle, so the parts should be worked to redistribute the
oil. Although there is some oil in your camera, never oil it
yourself. Three-in-one oil will completely destroy it by
getting everyplace it shouldn't be. Other internal damage
can be caused by leaky batteries, so replace the batteries
once a year.
Finally, although this hopefully will never happen to
you, it's nice to know what to do incase it does. If you
drop your camera into salt water, drive to the nearest gas
station and rinse it thoroughly with fresh water. Keeping it
wet, get it to a repair shop as quickly as possible. But
remember, be sure to keep it wet or it will be completely
unsalvageable when you take it into the shop.

can be caused by leaky batteries, so replace the batteries
once a year.
Finally, although this hopefully will never happen to
you, it's nice to know what to do incase it does. If you
drop your camera into salt water, drive to the nearest gas
station and rinse it thoroughly with fresh water. Keeping it
wet, get it to a repair shop as quickly as possible. But
remember, be sure to keep it wet or it will be completely
unsalvageable when you take it into the shop.

Millions of Americans own cameras, yet very few know
much about camera maintenance. Cameras are extremely
delicate and complicated machines, and if they are not
kept in good shape, the repair costs can be quite high. In a
simple range-finder camera, there can be as many as 50
electrical components and 250 mechanical parts — which
makes it somewhat understandable that repair shops
charge an average of $15 per hour.
If for some reason you should have trouble with your
camera, don't try to fix it yourself. If your camera really
needs repair, it's generally impossible to escape a relatively
high bill, but trying to repair your camera at home will
only get you into further trouble: a job that would have
cost $10 will probably end up at around $30, and it's very
easy to lose small but expensive parts.
Your camera, however, need never see the inside of a
repair shop if you take regular care of it and treat it with
respect.
Cheap Insurance
First of all, always use a neck strap: it's very cheap
insurance, since dropping your camera is a wonderful way
to cause permanent damage. If you have a strap, check it
periodically for signs of wear. It is best to use a leather or
cloth strap; a plastic one can snap in very cold weather.
The camera shutter should never be left cocked for long
periods of time. If the springs are kept taut for too long,
they may give out when you resume use.For cameras such
as Hasselblads and Mirandas with the shutter in the lens,
be sure to trip it when you remove it.
Cleaning the lens is also very important. A dirty front
element will not only make for bad pictures, but cleaning
it the wrong way may eventually grind the protective
coating off. A good solution to use is reagent grade
methanol applied with Q-tips. For removing dust a soft
nylon bristle paint brush and compressed air will do quite
nicely.
Filters For Protection
There are two reasons for using a UV or skylight filter.
Not only will it give you better pictures, but it will also
protect the front element of your lens. Use it especially
when there is a danger of small rocks being thrown by

cars, or salt water getting on the front element. They will
also protect the lens from the oil on your hands that can
be transfered by everyday use.
Plastic lens caps will help too. Remember to use them
faithfully. In order not to lose the cap, burn a hole in it
with a hot needle and attach a rubber band to the cap and
camera; that way it will never be left behind.
Keep It Clean v
It's a good idea to periodically clean the inside of your
camera with a soft nylon brush and compressed air.
"Omit" is very good for this as the flow of air is quite soft.
Anything too hard may blow a hole in the cloth shutter,
so be careful. (Film chips are an excellent example of why
you should clean your camera. If you come to the end of a
roll too suddenly and rip out the perforations you will
leave small film chips in the camera. The chips will
eventually work their way into the slow speed gear chain
causing the camera to jam. Cleaning your camera can
prevent this. As an example, a Nikon that has not been in
the shop for an overhaul for about 2V4 years and has
around 5 rolls of film going through it every week will cost
$40-50 to fix if film chips jam it.)
Never touch the pressure plate on the back of the
camera. The dirt and oil from your fingers will form a
goop on the plate that will make the film stick as it
advances. It's a good idea to clean the pressure plate with
reagent grade methanol and Q-tips. Nor should you touch
the film guides. They are unpainted and can be ruined very
quickly, as they have no protection at all.
Also, leave the mirror alone. Most mirrors have silver on
the surface and everytime you touch them or try to clean
them you rub off some of the silver, and after a while you
will notice that the image in the viewfinder is not as bright
as it used to be. Normal cost for a new mirror is $12, plus
$18 labor, so just leave it alone.
Cameras, Hot and Otherwise
One must be very careful of hot cameras, stolen or
otherwise. In the Bay Area, it's estimated that a camera
can be fenced within three hours. In case your camera is
stolen, copy down the serial number for future
identification. You can also engrave your drivers license
number on the main chassis. You still may not ever

recover your cahiera, but if you don't do at least one of
these two things jrou will never recover your camera.
Cameras left in the hot sun will cause the focus mount
grease to melt and run down the lens barrel to the iris
blades. The damage is not immediately noticeable, but
when the grease hardens again it will glue the iris blades
together.
If this happens you will be unable to stop down the
diaphragm and may cause extra damage when you click
the shutter, as the blades won't move. If this happens the
iris blades will have to be replaced, another expensive
operation. Iris blades in good condition should be dry and
have a snappy action. A good rule of thumb is, don't put
your camera any place you wouldn't want to be. A
comfortable temperature range is 32°-85°.
CI unitized
If you plan on visiting the desert or artic regions your
camera can be climitized to the weather. If your camera is
unclimitized, safe exposure to the elements depends on
how long it is left out.
It is also necessary to remember that if you come from
the cold into a humid and hot room, condensation will
form on the outside and inside of your camera, causing
rust to form. To prevent condensation, put your camera in
a plastic bag.
If you have not used your camera in a long time, be
sure to warm it up by working all the moving parts. If it
sits in one position for a long time the lubricant oils will
settle, so the parts should be worked to redistribute the
oil. Although there is some oil in your camera, never oil it
yourself. Three-in-one oil will completely destroy it by
getting everyplace it shouldn't be. Other internal damage
can be caused by leaky batteries, so replace the batteries
once a year.
Finally, although this hopefully will never happen to
you, it's nice to know what to do incase it does. If you
drop your camera into salt water, drive to the nearest gas

form on the outside and inside of your camera, causing
rust to form. To prevent condensation, put your camera in
a plastic bag.
If you have not used your camera in a long time, be
sure to warm it up by working all the moving parts. If it
sits in one position for a long time the lubricant oils will
settle, so the parts should be worked to redistribute the
oil. Although there is some oil in your camera, never oil it
yourself. Three-in-one oil will completely destroy it by
getting everyplace it shouldn't be. Other internal damage
can be caused by leaky batteries, so replace the batteries
once a year.
Finally, although this hopefully will never happen to
you, it's nice to know what to do incase it does. If you
drop your camera into salt water, drive to the nearest gas
station and rinse it thoroughly with fresh water. Keeping it
wet, get it to a repair shop as quickly as possible. But
remember, be sure to keep it wet or it will be completely
unsalvageable when you take it into the shop.

Millions of Americans own cameras, yet very few know
much about camera maintenance. Cameras are extremely
delicate and complicated machines, and if they are not
kept in good shape, the repair costs can be quite high. In a
simple range-finder camera, there can be as many as 50
electrical components and 250 mechanical parts — which
makes it somewhat understandable that repair shops
charge an average of $15 per hour.
If for some reason you should have trouble with your
camera, don't try to fix it yourself. If your camera really
needs repair, it's generally impossible to escape a relatively
high bill, but trying to repair your camera at home will
only get you into further trouble: a job that would have
cost $10 will probably end up at around $30, and it's very
easy to lose small but expensive parts.
Your camera, however, need never see the inside of a
repair shop if you take regular care of it and treat it with
respect.
Cheap Insurance
First of all, always use a neck strap: it's very cheap
insurance, since dropping your camera is a wonderful way
to cause permanent damage. If you have a strap, check it
periodically for signs of wear. It is best to use a leather or
cloth strap; a plastic one can snap in very cold weather.
The camera shutter should never be left cocked for long
periods of time. If the springs are kept taut for too long,
they may give out when you resume use.For cameras such
as Hasselblads and Mirandas with the shutter in the lens,
be sure to trip it when you remove it.
Cleaning the lens is also very important. A dirty front
element will not only make for bad pictures, but cleaning
it the wrong way may eventually grind the protective
coating off. A good solution to use is reagent grade
methanol applied with Q-tips. For removing dust a soft
nylon bristle paint brush and compressed air will do quite
nicely.
Filters For Protection
There are two reasons for using a UV or skylight filter.
Not only will it give you better pictures, but it will also
protect the front element of your lens. Use it especially
when there is a danger of small rocks being thrown by

cars, or salt water getting on the front element. They will
also protect the lens from the oil on your hands that can
be transfered by everyday use.
Plastic lens caps will help too. Remember to use them
faithfully. In order not to lose the cap, burn a hole in it
with a hot needle and attach a rubber band to the cap and
camera; that way it will never be left behind.
Keep It Clean v
It's a good idea to periodically clean the inside of your
camera with a soft nylon brush and compressed air.
"Omit" is very good for this as the flow of air is quite soft.
Anything too hard may blow a hole in the cloth shutter,
so be careful. (Film chips are an excellent example of why
you should clean your camera. If you come to the end of a
roll too suddenly and rip out the perforations you will
leave small film chips in the camera. The chips will
eventually work their way into the slow speed gear chain
causing the camera to jam. Cleaning your camera can
prevent this. As an example, a Nikon that has not been in
the shop for an overhaul for about 2V4 years and has
around 5 rolls of film going through it every week will cost
$40-50 to fix if film chips jam it.)
Never touch the pressure plate on the back of the
camera. The dirt and oil from your fingers will form a
goop on the plate that will make the film stick as it
advances. It's a good idea to clean the pressure plate with
reagent grade methanol and Q-tips. Nor should you touch
the film guides. They are unpainted and can be ruined very
quickly, as they have no protection at all.
Also, leave the mirror alone. Most mirrors have silver on
the surface and everytime you touch them or try to clean
them you rub off some of the silver, and after a while you
will notice that the image in the viewfinder is not as bright
as it used to be. Normal cost for a new mirror is $12, plus
$18 labor, so just leave it alone.
Cameras, Hot and Otherwise
One must be very careful of hot cameras, stolen or
otherwise. In the Bay Area, it's estimated that a camera
can be fenced within three hours. In case your camera is
stolen, copy down the serial number for future
identification. You can also engrave your drivers license
number on the main chassis. You still may not ever

recover your cahiera, but if you don't do at least one of
these two things jrou will never recover your camera.
Cameras left in the hot sun will cause the focus mount
grease to melt and run down the lens barrel to the iris
blades. The damage is not immediately noticeable, but
when the grease hardens again it will glue the iris blades
together.
If this happens you will be unable to stop down the
diaphragm and may cause extra damage when you click
the shutter, as the blades won't move. If this happens the
iris blades will have to be replaced, another expensive
operation. Iris blades in good condition should be dry and
have a snappy action. A good rule of thumb is, don't put
your camera any place you wouldn't want to be. A
comfortable temperature range is 32°-85°.
CI unitized
If you plan on visiting the desert or artic regions your
camera can be climitized to the weather. If your camera is
unclimitized, safe exposure to the elements depends on
how long it is left out.
It is also necessary to remember that if you come from
the cold into a humid and hot room, condensation will
form on the outside and inside of your camera, causing
rust to form. To prevent condensation, put your camera in
a plastic bag.

have a snappy action. A good rule of thumb is, don't put
your camera any place you wouldn't want to be. A
comfortable temperature range is 32°-85°.
CI unitized
If you plan on visiting the desert or artic regions your
camera can be climitized to the weather. If your camera is
unclimitized, safe exposure to the elements depends on
how long it is left out.
It is also necessary to remember that if you come from
the cold into a humid and hot room, condensation will
form on the outside and inside of your camera, causing
rust to form. To prevent condensation, put your camera in
a plastic bag.
If you have not used your camera in a long time, be
sure to warm it up by working all the moving parts. If it
sits in one position for a long time the lubricant oils will
settle, so the parts should be worked to redistribute the
oil. Although there is some oil in your camera, never oil it
yourself. Three-in-one oil will completely destroy it by
getting everyplace it shouldn't be. Other internal damage
can be caused by leaky batteries, so replace the batteries
once a year.
Finally, although this hopefully will never happen to
you, it's nice to know what to do incase it does. If you
drop your camera into salt water, drive to the nearest gas
station and rinse it thoroughly with fresh water. Keeping it
wet, get it to a repair shop as quickly as possible. But
remember, be sure to keep it wet or it will be completely
unsalvageable when you take it into the shop.
