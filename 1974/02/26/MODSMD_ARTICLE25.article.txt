# Olympus Introduces OM-1: Light, Small 35 mm System
## 
### WILLIAM EUPHRAT 
Introducing what one could
call a revolutionary- idea, Ponder
and Bess has come out with a
concept that many camera buffs
have sought for years. After
surveying the market, they
decided that the public wanted a
smaller 35 mm camera, one that
fits easily into a coat pocket or
knapsack.
Yet, instead of designing only a
camera with a fixed focal length
of 35 mm, they designed a
multi-focal length single lens
reflex (SLR) system as well. In
this sense, the Olympus OM-1
system is completely new, for no
other company on the market has
such a compact interchangeable
system for sale.
No maverick on the
photo-technological scene, Ponder

and Bess has been producing
medical photography equipment
for a number of years now. It has
also produced medical
microscopes, which requires
excellent optical resolution.
Ponder and Bess spokesmen
claim that the new OM-1 system is
equal to or better than the old
medical photography system. In
fact, they recommend the OM-1
for medical microphotography.
Equipment
When final production is
complete, the OM-1 system will
sport a grand total of 280 units of
equipment, more than enough for
the most avid photographer.
There will be 30 different
kinds of lenses (8 mm fish eye to
1000 mm telephoto), plus special
equipment of all types as well.
Although everything is not yet

obtainable, the complete system
should be available to the public
by June. There are currently 22 of
the 30 lenses ready for purchase,
as well as seven out of 12
different types of screen finders.
The philosophy behind the
OM-1 is that cameras don't have
to be big to be good, and the
objective has been professional
efficiency without bulk.
Although the OM-1 is smaller
than others, its "originality"
remains to be seen. Ponder and
Bess has modified the overall 35
mm design somewhat. The OM-1
is 33 percent smaller and 33
percent lighter than any other 35
mm SLR made, and supposedly
boasts a mirror some 70 percent
brighter than any other made
currently on the market. For
those on the lookout for a
lightweight SLR, the prospects
look good.
Drawbacks
However, not everything is as
good as it seems at first glance.
Perhaps because of its novelty,
Olympus has taken the liberty of
charging a relatively high price for
its new toy. A new OM-1 with a
1.8 lens retails at most stores for
about $320.
Another drawback is the
incompatability of the OM-1 with
lenses manufactured by other
companies. Because of its relative
size, Olympus makes the only lens
capable of fitting an OM-1 mount,

reflex camera available with interchangeable lenses.
