# Olympus Introduces OM-1: Light, Small 35 mm System
## 
### WILLIAM EUPHRAT 
Introducing what one could
call a revolutionary- idea, Ponder
and Bess has come out with a
concept that many camera buffs
have sought for years. After
surveying the market, they
decided that the public wanted a
smaller 35 mm camera, one that
fits easily into a coat pocket or
knapsack.
Yet, instead of designing only a
camera with a fixed focal length
of 35 mm, they designed a
multi-focal length single lens
reflex (SLR) system as well. In
this sense, the Olympus OM-1
system is completely new, for no
other company on the market has
such a compact interchangeable
system for sale.
No maverick on the
photo-technological scene, Ponder

and Bess has been producing
medical photography equipment
for a number of years now. It has
also produced medical
microscopes, which requires
excellent optical resolution.
Ponder and Bess spokesmen
claim that the new OM-1 system is
equal to or better than the old
medical photography system. In
fact, they recommend the OM-1
for medical microphotography.
Equipment
When final production is
complete, the OM-1 system will
sport a grand total of 280 units of
equipment, more than enough for
the most avid photographer.
There will be 30 different
kinds of lenses (8 mm fish eye to
1000 mm telephoto), plus special
equipment of all types as well.
Although everything is not yet

obtainable, the complete system
should be available to the public
by June. There are currently 22 of
the 30 lenses ready for purchase,
as well as seven out of 12
different types of screen finders.
The philosophy behind the
OM-1 is that cameras don't have
to be big to be good, and the
objective has been professional
efficiency without bulk.
Although the OM-1 is smaller
than others, its "originality"
remains to be seen. Ponder and
Bess has modified the overall 35
mm design somewhat. The OM-1
is 33 percent smaller and 33
percent lighter than any other 35
mm SLR made, and supposedly
boasts a mirror some 70 percent
brighter than any other made
currently on the market. For
those on the lookout for a
lightweight SLR, the prospects
look good.
Drawbacks
However, not everything is as
good as it seems at first glance.
Perhaps because of its novelty,
Olympus has taken the liberty of
charging a relatively high price for
its new toy. A new OM-1 with a
1.8 lens retails at most stores for
about $320.
Another drawback is the
incompatability of the OM-1 with
lenses manufactured by other
companies. Because of its relative
size, Olympus makes the only lens
capable of fitting an OM-1 mount,

giving it a monopoly for the
product. Soligar and Tamron
claim it has an adaptor ring for
the OM-1 mount, but none are
currently available in the United
States. Thus, those enamored with
the small SLR concept will have
to put up with a limited supply of
lenses.
Furthermore, at this point,
Olympus claims to have $8
million in back orders on the
OM-1. While they use this fact to
push sales, an alert, interested
buyer cannot help but realize that
he will have to endure long waits
for his merchandise. All these
back orders are fine for Ponder
and Bess, but the customer may
be rudely inconvenienced if he is
in any sort of hurry.
Appeal
Everything taken into
consideration, the OM-1 system
could prove to be an excellent
idea. Its appeal is especially
evident to those who are searching
for something small, yet still
capable of good quality.
However, for those used to a
large 35 mm SLR, the small
Olympus could prove to be more
of a problem than an asset. Its
small size could take a great deal
of getting used to. But for those
who do not have a camera and are
interested in one that is small and
versatile, the OM-1 should be a
consideration.
The choice, as always, is the
consumer's. He must decide what
features he wants on his camera,
which entails exhaustive research
on his part. An investment of
around $300 should not be done
indescriminately. You get what
you pay for.

different types of screen finders.
The philosophy behind the
OM-1 is that cameras don't have
to be big to be good, and the
objective has been professional
efficiency without bulk.
Although the OM-1 is smaller
than others, its "originality"
remains to be seen. Ponder and
Bess has modified the overall 35
mm design somewhat. The OM-1
is 33 percent smaller and 33
percent lighter than any other 35
mm SLR made, and supposedly
boasts a mirror some 70 percent
brighter than any other made
currently on the market. For
those on the lookout for a
lightweight SLR, the prospects
look good.
Drawbacks
However, not everything is as
good as it seems at first glance.
Perhaps because of its novelty,
Olympus has taken the liberty of
charging a relatively high price for
its new toy. A new OM-1 with a
1.8 lens retails at most stores for
about $320.
Another drawback is the
incompatability of the OM-1 with
lenses manufactured by other
companies. Because of its relative
size, Olympus makes the only lens
capable of fitting an OM-1 mount,

Photography Club, checks out the new Olympus OM-1 through a

giving it a monopoly for the
product. Soligar and Tamron
claim it has an adaptor ring for
the OM-1 mount, but none are
currently available in the United
States. Thus, those enamored with
the small SLR concept will have
to put up with a limited supply of
lenses.
Furthermore, at this point,
Olympus claims to have $8
million in back orders on the
OM-1. While they use this fact to
push sales, an alert, interested
buyer cannot help but realize that
he will have to endure long waits
for his merchandise. All these
back orders are fine for Ponder
and Bess, but the customer may
be rudely inconvenienced if he is
in any sort of hurry.
Appeal
Everything taken into
consideration, the OM-1 system
could prove to be an excellent
idea. Its appeal is especially
evident to those who are searching
for something small, yet still
capable of good quality.
However, for those used to a
large 35 mm SLR, the small
Olympus could prove to be more
of a problem than an asset. Its
small size could take a great deal
of getting used to. But for those
who do not have a camera and are
interested in one that is small and
versatile, the OM-1 should be a
consideration.
The choice, as always, is the
consumer's. He must decide what
features he wants on his camera,
which entails exhaustive research
on his part. An investment of
around $300 should not be done
indescriminately. You get what
you pay for.

A FORTUNE IN GLASS—Pictured here is an assortment of Olwipus
cameras and lenses. Paul Taplin, a sales representative from Ponder
and Bess, recently came here to talk to the photo club members and
explain just what exactly the OM-1 is. Although he himself carried a
large selection of the new Olympus line, he warned club members that
the entire line would not be available until June.
Introducing what one could
call a revolutionary- idea, Ponder
and Bess has come out with a
concept that many camera buffs
have sought for years. After
surveying the market, they
decided that the public wanted a
smaller 35 mm camera, one that
fits easily into a coat pocket or
knapsack.
Yet, instead of designing only a
camera with a fixed focal length
of 35 mm, they designed a
multi-focal length single lens
reflex (SLR) system as well. In
this sense, the Olympus OM-1
system is completely new, for no
other company on the market has
such a compact interchangeable
system for sale.
No maverick on the
photo-technological scene, Ponder

and Bess has been producing
medical photography equipment
for a number of years now. It has
also produced medical
microscopes, which requires
excellent optical resolution.
Ponder and Bess spokesmen
claim that the new OM-1 system is
equal to or better than the old
medical photography system. In
fact, they recommend the OM-1
for medical microphotography.
Equipment
When final production is
complete, the OM-1 system will
sport a grand total of 280 units of
equipment, more than enough for
the most avid photographer.
There will be 30 different
kinds of lenses (8 mm fish eye to
1000 mm telephoto), plus special
equipment of all types as well.
Although everything is not yet

obtainable, the complete system
should be available to the public
by June. There are currently 22 of
the 30 lenses ready for purchase,
as well as seven out of 12
different types of screen finders.

the small SLR concept will have
to put up with a limited supply of
lenses.
Furthermore, at this point,
Olympus claims to have $8
million in back orders on the
OM-1. While they use this fact to
push sales, an alert, interested
buyer cannot help but realize that
he will have to endure long waits
for his merchandise. All these
back orders are fine for Ponder
and Bess, but the customer may
be rudely inconvenienced if he is
in any sort of hurry.
Appeal
Everything taken into
consideration, the OM-1 system
could prove to be an excellent
idea. Its appeal is especially
evident to those who are searching
for something small, yet still
capable of good quality.
However, for those used to a
large 35 mm SLR, the small
Olympus could prove to be more
of a problem than an asset. Its
small size could take a great deal
of getting used to. But for those
who do not have a camera and are
interested in one that is small and
versatile, the OM-1 should be a
consideration.
The choice, as always, is the
consumer's. He must decide what
features he wants on his camera,
which entails exhaustive research
on his part. An investment of
around $300 should not be done
indescriminately. You get what
you pay for.

A FORTUNE IN GLASS—Pictured here is an assortment of Olwipus
cameras and lenses. Paul Taplin, a sales representative from Ponder
and Bess, recently came here to talk to the photo club members and
explain just what exactly the OM-1 is. Although he himself carried a
large selection of the new Olympus line, he warned club members that
the entire line would not be available until June.
Introducing what one could
call a revolutionary- idea, Ponder
and Bess has come out with a
concept that many camera buffs
have sought for years. After
surveying the market, they
decided that the public wanted a
smaller 35 mm camera, one that
fits easily into a coat pocket or
knapsack.
Yet, instead of designing only a
camera with a fixed focal length
of 35 mm, they designed a
multi-focal length single lens
reflex (SLR) system as well. In
this sense, the Olympus OM-1
system is completely new, for no
other company on the market has
such a compact interchangeable
system for sale.
No maverick on the
photo-technological scene, Ponder

and Bess has been producing
medical photography equipment
for a number of years now. It has
also produced medical
microscopes, which requires
excellent optical resolution.
Ponder and Bess spokesmen
claim that the new OM-1 system is
equal to or better than the old
medical photography system. In
fact, they recommend the OM-1
for medical microphotography.
Equipment
When final production is
complete, the OM-1 system will
sport a grand total of 280 units of
equipment, more than enough for
the most avid photographer.
There will be 30 different
kinds of lenses (8 mm fish eye to
1000 mm telephoto), plus special
equipment of all types as well.
Although everything is not yet

obtainable, the complete system
should be available to the public
by June. There are currently 22 of
the 30 lenses ready for purchase,
as well as seven out of 12
different types of screen finders.
The philosophy behind the
OM-1 is that cameras don't have
to be big to be good, and the
objective has been professional
efficiency without bulk.
Although the OM-1 is smaller
than others, its "originality"
remains to be seen. Ponder and
Bess has modified the overall 35
mm design somewhat. The OM-1
is 33 percent smaller and 33
percent lighter than any other 35
mm SLR made, and supposedly
boasts a mirror some 70 percent
brighter than any other made
currently on the market. For
those on the lookout for a
lightweight SLR, the prospects
look good.
Drawbacks
However, not everything is as
good as it seems at first glance.
Perhaps because of its novelty,
Olympus has taken the liberty of
charging a relatively high price for
its new toy. A new OM-1 with a
1.8 lens retails at most stores for
about $320.
Another drawback is the
incompatability of the OM-1 with
lenses manufactured by other
companies. Because of its relative
size, Olympus makes the only lens
capable of fitting an OM-1 mount,

giving it a monopoly for the
product. Soligar and Tamron
claim it has an adaptor ring for
the OM-1 mount, but none are
currently available in the United
States. Thus, those enamored with

to put up with a limited supply of
lenses.
