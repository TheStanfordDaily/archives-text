The photographs on the following pages
have all been taken by students. Except for
Dave Madison, who is a member of the
Stanford Photography Club, all the
photographers are enrolled in either Art
170, 171, or 270.
We feel that the essays assembled are
strong enough to stand alone, without
special comments on individual pictures.
A photographer's camera is a creative
tool. He can either record reality or present
a subjective interpretation of the world he
perceives. We think that the essays
presented here are more than just recorded
images. We therefore invite you to look at
and appraise these photographs, and hope
you will enjoy them as much as we have.
