# 'Unprecedented, Unconstitutional'
## Law Profs Battle Gag Order 
### DON COX 
Law Prof. William Gould and his
counsel, Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam, are currently engaged in
legal battle against a court gag order
on Gould that Amsterdam said is
unprecedented in its
unconstitutionality.
"This is an extraordinary case,"
said Amsterdam in his brief filed in
U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
last Tuesday. "So far as we can tell, no
court has ever issued an order of the
sort made by Judge [Robert H.]
Schnacke [U.S. District Court,
Northern California District!."
"What happened here would be
unimaginable if it had not happened,"
said Amsterdam, arguing for the lifting
of the gag order.

Gould had been seeking a
preliminary injunction against local
Teamsters unions and the Pacific
Intermountain Express company as
part of a $50 million suit alledging
discriminatory practices by major
trucking companies and the Teamsters.
Schnacke, in a court order Feb. 15,
forbade him from "directly or
indirectly, orally or in writing, to
communicate" with anyone "not a
formal party to the action."
Communication Restricted
Amsterdam said this order forbids
all communication between Gould and
witnesses in the class action
potential witnesses, federal agencies,
the public and the news media.
Gould had been collecting
information for the trial when lawyers

for the defendants filed a motion with
the District Court asking Schnacke to
restrict Gould's communication with
persons in connection with the suit.
The defendants attorneys
complained that Gould was engaged in
solicitation, that is, soliciting new
clients.
Denies Allegation
Gould said in district court Feb. 15
that he has "never engaged in any
solicitation of any kind."
Schnacke then lectured Gould on
legal ethics and said "I appreciate that
the class action concept seemingly has
dulled that notion [of legal ethicaiity]
in the minds of some counsel."
"There shall be nothing that smacks
of solicitation until the further hearing
before this court," said Schnacke.
When Gould said that he could
"not agree not to communicate,"
Schnacke retorted that he didn't "care
whether you [Gould] agree or not.
There will be no communications
about the case prior to March 15 and
until further order of the Court."
Gould asked Amsterdam to
represent him when the gag order was
imposed. "You know how it goes, a
lawyer who defends himself has a fool
for a client," said Gould.
Ban Unconstitutional
"Judicial injunctions of solicitation
which were far more narrowly tailored
than Judge Schnacke's indiscriminate
ban upon 'communications' have
repeatedly been held
unconstitutional," said Amsterdam.
"But the interference with free
speech condemned in all of these cases
did not approach the quality of the
orders entered in the present case,"
added Amsterdam.
Gould would not comment on the
case yesterday other than to say that
he "believes the only way we can win
this is by playing the rules of the game
no matter how unreasonable the rules
are.
"I believe in the judicial process
and that the judicial system will
eventually vindicate me," said Gould.
Obeying, Challenging
"We are obeying the order and
challenging it in court since that is the
appropriate thing to do though not the
legally necessary" thing to do, said
Amsterdam.
Gould's class action suit against the
trucking firms and the Teamsters asks
for punitive damages to be awarded to
minority truck drivers who applied for
jobs and were refused and also for
drivers who would have applied but
did not because of the firms'
discriminatory reputation.
Gould won a similar suit last year
against Detroit Edison for $4.5 million
in damages. The case is now on appeal.
Gould said that he had learned that
former Secretary of State William
Rogers would represent Detroit Edison
in court against Gould.
Big Burden
Amsterdam said Gould "must now
forego making his scheduled speeches
or speak under the mind-staggering,
repressive burden of weighing each
word against the possibility that it will
expose him to contempt sanctions."
It "impedes Professor Gould's and
plaintiff's abilities immediately to
gather the facts necessary to bring on
their motion for a preliminary
injunction" in "palpable derogation of
fundamental constitutional
principles."
"Solicitation is not a talisman that
makes the First Amendment's
freedoms vanish," said Amsterdam.

that he has "never engaged in any
solicitation of any kind."
Schnacke then lectured Gould on
legal ethics and said "I appreciate that
the class action concept seemingly has
dulled that notion [of legal ethicaiity]
in the minds of some counsel."
"There shall be nothing that smacks
of solicitation until the further hearing
before this court," said Schnacke.
When Gould said that he could
"not agree not to communicate,"
Schnacke retorted that he didn't "care
whether you [Gould] agree or not.
There will be no communications
about the case prior to March 15 and
until further order of the Court."
Gould asked Amsterdam to
represent him when the gag order was
imposed. "You know how it goes, a
lawyer who defends himself has a fool
for a client," said Gould.
Ban Unconstitutional
"Judicial injunctions of solicitation
which were far more narrowly tailored
than Judge Schnacke's indiscriminate
ban upon 'communications' have
repeatedly been held
unconstitutional," said Amsterdam.
"But the interference with free
speech condemned in all of these cases
did not approach the quality of the
orders entered in the present case,"
added Amsterdam.
Gould would not comment on the
case yesterday other than to say that
he "believes the only way we can win
this is by playing the rules of the game
no matter how unreasonable the rules
are.
"I believe in the judicial process
and that the judicial system will
eventually vindicate me," said Gould.
Obeying, Challenging
"We are obeying the order and
challenging it in court since that is the
appropriate thing to do though not the
legally necessary" thing to do, said
Amsterdam.
Gould's class action suit against the
trucking firms and the Teamsters asks
for punitive damages to be awarded to
minority truck drivers who applied for
jobs and were refused and also for
drivers who would have applied but
did not because of the firms'
discriminatory reputation.
Gould won a similar suit last year
against Detroit Edison for $4.5 million
in damages. The case is now on appeal.
Gould said that he had learned that
former Secretary of State William
Rogers would represent Detroit Edison
in court against Gould.
Big Burden
Amsterdam said Gould "must now
forego making his scheduled speeches
or speak under the mind-staggering,
repressive burden of weighing each
word against the possibility that it will
expose him to contempt sanctions."
It "impedes Professor Gould's and
plaintiff's abilities immediately to
gather the facts necessary to bring on
their motion for a preliminary
injunction" in "palpable derogation of
fundamental constitutional
principles."
"Solicitation is not a talisman that
makes the First Amendment's
freedoms vanish," said Amsterdam.
Law Prof. William Gould and his
counsel, Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam, are currently engaged in
legal battle against a court gag order
on Gould that Amsterdam said is
unprecedented in its
unconstitutionality.
"This is an extraordinary case,"
said Amsterdam in his brief filed in
U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
last Tuesday. "So far as we can tell, no
court has ever issued an order of the
sort made by Judge [Robert H.]
Schnacke [U.S. District Court,
Northern California District!."
"What happened here would be
unimaginable if it had not happened,"
said Amsterdam, arguing for the lifting
of the gag order.

Gould had been seeking a
preliminary injunction against local
Teamsters unions and the Pacific
Intermountain Express company as
part of a $50 million suit alledging
discriminatory practices by major
trucking companies and the Teamsters.
Schnacke, in a court order Feb. 15,
forbade him from "directly or
indirectly, orally or in writing, to
communicate" with anyone "not a
formal party to the action."
Communication Restricted
Amsterdam said this order forbids
all communication between Gould and
witnesses in the class action
potential witnesses, federal agencies,
the public and the news media.
Gould had been collecting
information for the trial when lawyers

for the defendants filed a motion with
the District Court asking Schnacke to
restrict Gould's communication with
persons in connection with the suit.
The defendants attorneys
complained that Gould was engaged in
solicitation, that is, soliciting new
clients.

that he has "never engaged in any

Gould's class action suit against the
trucking firms and the Teamsters asks
for punitive damages to be awarded to
minority truck drivers who applied for
jobs and were refused and also for
drivers who would have applied but
did not because of the firms'
discriminatory reputation.
Gould won a similar suit last year
against Detroit Edison for $4.5 million
in damages. The case is now on appeal.
Gould said that he had learned that
former Secretary of State William
Rogers would represent Detroit Edison
in court against Gould.
Big Burden
Amsterdam said Gould "must now
forego making his scheduled speeches
or speak under the mind-staggering,
repressive burden of weighing each
word against the possibility that it will
expose him to contempt sanctions."
It "impedes Professor Gould's and
plaintiff's abilities immediately to
gather the facts necessary to bring on
their motion for a preliminary
injunction" in "palpable derogation of
fundamental constitutional
principles."
"Solicitation is not a talisman that
makes the First Amendment's
freedoms vanish," said Amsterdam.
