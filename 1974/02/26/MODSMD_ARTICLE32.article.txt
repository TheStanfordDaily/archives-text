# Color: A Separate Medium
## 
### ANDREW BRIDGES 
Most people tend to think of color photography
as black and white with all the proper colors filled
in. To most amateurs, the choice between color and
black and white film for a particular shot is
dictated by cost; more valuable shots, they feel,
deserve to be in color.
But to think of color photography in this
manner denies the fact that it is a different
medium. An artist will find charcoal or pen and ink
drawing suitable for certain works, and oils or
acrylics suitable for others. Rarely can two
different media convey the same expression for an
artist; indeed, part of the expression lies in the
choice of the medium.
This same thought applies to the choice between
color and black and white photography; the two
are not simply interchangeable.
Color photography is more expensive and more
complicated than black and white; many
photographers shy away from doing their own
processing out of fear of the cost and the difficulty.
But color processing is not all that expensive and
not that difficult.
Color 11 x 14s, which — commercially processed

— cost over $6, can cost the do-it-yourselfer as little
as 84 cents, and there are some photographers who
learn color processing before they know black
and white.
In color photography there are two different
basic processes which yield two different finished
products, slides and prints. Slides are no more than
the film from the camera developed and mounted
in cardboard squares. The Kodachrome,
Ektaghrome, Agfachrome, Anscochrome and
Fujichrome films are this type. Because slide
processing is a relatively simple process, it is
cheaper to shoot slides than prints.
The other type of process is the negative
process. In this, the film from the camera is
developed and then projected through an enlarger
onto color-sensitive photo paper. The paper is then
developed in its own process and the print is
produced
For even old die-hard black and white
enthusiasts who have long lost the sense of magic in
photography, that first color print will be a real
trip. Good books to read for background on color
processing are Printing Color Negatives and Kodak
Color Films, both published by Kodak.
