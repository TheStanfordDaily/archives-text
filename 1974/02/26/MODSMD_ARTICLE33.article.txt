## Instructors Stress 'Visual Awareness' 
### RON BECK 
Few people enter Stanford
because of its Photography
Department. In fact, since the
department was instituted in
September 1969, only about a
half dozen students have left
Stanford with the intention of
pursuing photography
professionally.
Tne department consists of
two teachers — Leo Holub and
Robert Parker — lots of chemicals,
17 photo enlargers, and 150
students every quarter. There are
four different photography
courses taught every quarter:
beginning and intermediate
photography, photo essay and
silkscreening, and individual work
in photography. Holub and Parker
do all the teaching themselves, as
they have since the beginning of
the department.
The department started in
1969 under Holub's sole
direction. Parker joined him the
next year, and there have been no
staff changes since. The
department is under the aegis of
the Art Department, and except
for the initial investment in the
enlargers, Holub says that there is
"no budget per se."
Chemicals are paid for out of
the lab fees of $5 per student per
quarter. Photo paper is supplied
by each student.
'Visual Awareness'
Holub sees the goal of the
department as teaching "visual
awareness, how to actually see
things. ..Holub makes clear

that rather than "training
someone technically so that he
can push lights around in some
studio," the department teaches
students how to enjoy taking and
developing their own pictures for
their own pleasure.
Holub also points out that for
technical instruction, a person
interested in studying
photography for professional
reasons is better off at a school
like the San Francisco Arts
Institute.
"We are absolutely not a
training ground for a future
professional. We have a basic
philosophy: We teach a student
how to work in straight
photography, its controls and
disciplines," he says.
Expression, Composition
"The first thing we try to teach
a new student is expression. Then
we teach composition, and lastly
technique. Other schools
emphasize technique first." He
explains that by technique, he
means knowing the right
temperatures to develop, knowing
the proper lighting setups, and
other details.
Above everything else, Holub is
quite proud of what has taken
place as far as Stanford
photography interest is
concerned. Before 1969, there
was nothing the interested camera
buff could do to further his
learning. Now, the classes are so
popular that it's difficult even to
sign up for one of the classes.
Holub looks to a letter that the

department received form Ansel
Adams as one of the high points
in the department's growth.
Adams, one of the greatest
commercial photographers ever,
wrote Holub and Parker after
visiting the classes and seeing
some of the student photos.
"You have a handsome set up.
I never realized it was so good and
extensive, and the student work is
highly imaginative and clean in
spirit," Adams wrote. He
underscored "clean in spirit," and
Holub feels especially proud of
that. "That's exactly how I see
our program, 'Clean in spirit.' "
Possible Improvements
An infusion of money would
greatly benefit the program;
Holub envisions a number of
improvements that could be
made. "The first thing we'd do is
to start a course on the history of
photography. If we held it in
Dinkelspiel, incoming freshman
could have a chance to participate
in the program, and we could
make it a prerequisite for all the
lab courses." Presently, freshmen
are locked out of the department
when they first enter in the fall,
since the class fills up the spring
before during pre-registration.
Holub would also like to add a
course in large format
photography for very advanced
students. Finally, he added that a
"better classroom could be nicer.
We definitely plan to improve our
offering as soon as we can."
Improvement, though, does mean
more money, and Holub doesn't

see it coming in the near future.
Classes Limited
The photo classes are limited
to black and white, because color
processing is very expensive and
certainly not in the foreseeable
future of the department. "We'd
like to deal with color, but
we've only got a cold water
darkroom," Holub said, referring
to the fact that color processing
deals with precise temperatures,
which the two student darkrooms
can't achieve.
Each quarter, Parker teaches
two basic photography sections
and Holub one. Parker teaches the
class in photojournalism and
silk-screening, Holub teaches both
intermediate sections, and the two
teachers split up the task of
helping the 30 or so students
involved with advanced
photography.
"We hate to restrict the classes,
but it is a studio course, and we
just can't accommodate any more
people," said Holub. (The
maximum number of students in
each of the classes is 34.) Groups
of two students share the 17
enlargers.
Holub feels that two students
to an enlarger is the perfect
number for learning. The partners

help each other out in case of
problems, and both students get
as much time as they really need
for their photos.
Technique, Quality
The department starts its
technical learning with "how to
expose and develop film with
maximum clarity" and then trys
to achieve "high print quality."
Holub feels very strongly that it
would be a "disservice to teach
tricks," and he and Parker have to
teach completely the essentials of
photography.
Holub stresses the need to
learn composition. However, he
notes that composition is mostly
an innate talent, and concedes
that it might be the hardest thing
to teach. If the student doesn't
have some sort of aesthetic sense,
then he'll have a rough time.
Holub says, however, that either
he or Parker are always there to
help. "We practically live in the
photo department."
Holub feels that there are
limitless job opportunities for
professional photographers, but
emphasizes that the photo
department is not trying to fill
those jobs with Stanford
graduates.
