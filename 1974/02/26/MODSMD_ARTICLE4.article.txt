# Lecture Note Service Examined
## 
### RONALD BECK 
For the past 40 years at Berkeley, it
has been possible to go to an
off-campus store and buy lecture notes
for UC classes. For 11 years, UCLA
has had a similar off-campus service.
Two other Pac-8 schools recently
adopted the same program and it now
looks as if Stanford may not be far off
from some type of note service.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady
mentioned starting a note service as
part of his campaign platform last
year. Citing the Medical School's
program as a possible prototype,
O'Grady suggested a campus-wide
program.
"At the Med School, each professor
prints out his daily notes, and the
Department runs them off. If you're
absent, you can get copies of class
notes from lectures you missed. I
don't see why that can't be done for
the whole school," he said.
UCLA's student body, ASUCLA,
has just started its own note program
on campus last fall, in direct

competition with the off-campus
company. Paying professional note
takers to sit in on classes and take
notes, ASUCLA runs them off, and
then sells them to class members.
Under the UCLA system, the
professor is entitled to 10 percent of
the gross intake (an arbitrary figure
made customary by Berkeley's
service), while the note-taker makes $6
for every 50-minute lecture.
Losing Money
According to Paul Davis, manager
of ASUCLA notes, the service has
been running at a loss so far this year.
In fact, Davis expects to lose
"significant sums of money" this year,
and doesn't foresee a turnaround for
about three more years.
Sheer economics cause the deficit,
according to Davis, who claims
ASUCLA is "making a Cadillac and
selling it at Chevy prices."
To cover 39 large lecture classes,
typeset and distribute the notes,
ASUCLA employs over 70 people. The
service has about 3600 "subscribers"

who pay only $6 a quarter to come in
weekly and pick up the week's notes.
Departmental Initiation
O'Grady envisioned a lower quality
but less expensive product for the
ASSU. O'Grady would like to see each
academic department produce its own
notes. ASUCLA does millions of
dollars worth of business each year
and can well afford to underwrite a
costly program, while the ASSU is
operating completely on a break-even
tight budget.
O'Grady felt making notes before a
lecture would be a relatively easy task
that a teacher could do to improve
class learning. "I think that pre-made
lecture notes can be an extremely
important part of teaching in some
large lecture courses."
Ron Nessim, an undergrad here
said, "In a poli-sci class I took last
quarter, the professor handed out
outlines before each lecture. It made
both listening and note-taking a lot
easier."

GOULD GAGGED — Law Prof. William Gould, aided by Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam, is fighting a court gag order imposed following a complaint from
lawyers representing the Pacific Intermountain Express (P.1.E.) and the
Teamsters. Gould is suing P.I.E. and the Teamsters for engaging in
discriminatory practices.
Controls on the service are
necessary, Davis said. Deciding who
takes the notes is a very important
question. ASUCLA's policy is to
restrict note-takers to class TAs,
graduate students of the same subject
or a person appointed by the
professor. The professor must approve
the choice.
Professors involved with the service
are generally enthusiastic, according to
a UCLA history professor who added,
"1 know that I'm getting better results
lrom teaching when students aren't
forced to bury their heads in their
notebooks. If they just listen to me,
and then jot down the most important
points, they really do get a lot more
out of the lectures."
Beginning an on-campus note
service here would require starting
capital. O'Grady sees an initial kickoff
from the ASSU as a possibility. "If we
can start any sort of note program, we
could really be helping out a lot of
people," he said.
