# Prof Makes Math Less Intimidating

The sign reads:
$10 straight lecture
$ 15 topless lecture
$20 give the professor a lecture
"ask about our specials "
The door leads into office 382N in the mathematics
department. Pasted around the sign are two cartoon figures asking
each other "Are you thinking?," other quotations including "In
God We Trust" and a series of drawings entitled 'The 13Facesof
Karel Deleeuw," created by his young son Eric.
There are not really 13 faces there anymore. Some have been
taken down. Those that remain cast Deleeuw in roles ranging
from martian to magician to clown to professor.
Clad in blue jeans and a red sport shirt and seated at his desk
amidst papers scattered on the floor, Deleeuw, bearded and
appearing in his late forties, does indeed defy the professorial
archetype. But the three rows of calculus books lining his shelves
coupled with his Princeton Ph.D. and 15 years experience here
serve as proof that Deleeuw has participated in the educational
process long enough to criticize its methods.
While teaching required mathematics courses, Deleeuw first
came to grips with students frustrated by courses they didn't
want to take.
Hidden Curriculum
He recalls classes "crammed full of people who hated math less
than they hated French and that was terrible." Deleeuw then
thought about the educational problems and discovered the
" 'hidden curriculum.' That's all about how you need experts to
xplain things to you. It's the main thing you learn in school —
that you can't figure out things for yourself.
"Perhaps there should be a required course in how to think,
but I don't know who's competent to teach it. Besides, I certainly
don't want to teach another course that's required," he says.
A year and a half ago, his thinking reached fruition. Based on

discussions with other professors advocating "science for the
non-scientist," he came up with an idea for how best to teach
math, to students previously intimidated or frustrated by it.
His goal was to "help students who could not analyze
problems, to emphasize understanding, visualization, figuring
things out. And most important, to instill a sense of confidence in
their minds — to show them they could do it."
Create Confidence
To create that confidence Deleeuw advocates cooperation
rather than competition, allowing students to communicate with
and learn from each other in small groups. He lectures, only
infrequently to avoid the students feeling "that this is just one
more lesson and I need him to explain it to me." Mainly, he
answers questions. Students earn grades on the basis of completed
work rather than tests because Deleeuw believes a course is
"much more comfortable if 1 can say to students, 'this is what
you do for a B and this for an A.' "
After he formulated his ideas he took them to math Ph.D.
candidate Phil Faillace, already a Ph.D. in philosophy. Faillace
recalls, "We wanted to give people whose experiences in
mathematics haven't been pleasant a chance to get satisfaction
that mathematicians and scientists get when they solve a
problem." Faillace helped Deleeuw prepare course outlines and
notes. Then came the hard part — getting financial support.
For that, Deleeuw approached Martin Weiner, assistant to the
dean of undergraduate studies. Weiner now reflects, "I liked it
immediately. It took an interesting approach, teaching algebra
and trig to students who worked closely with each other."
Department response was "extremely positive," according to
Deleeuw. And Math Department Y' ce Chairman Paul Berg
confirms that fact, calling the idea "most certainly desirable."
Thus Deleeuw conceived and began Math 2, one of the most
innovative courses here. Four quarters have passes since the
course's inception and 250 students have passed the curriculum.

NEW TEACHING METHOD - Math Prof. Karel Deleeuw gains
positive response with his innovative course in math that
teaches "science for the non-scientist."
Although minor changes continue to occur, Deleeuw's original
ideas are still in effect.
Two Parts
The course is divided into two parts, each durating a quarter.
Part A presents games, puzzles, algebra and geometry — all aimed
at "conceptualization," according to Deleeuw. Part B "hits
algebra and trig a lot harder and aims toward preparing people for
higher math." He emphasizes that it is not necessary to take both
quarters: "It is up to the individual."
Who should take Math 2? Deleeuw recommends talking to
former and current Math 2 students because "it depends on the
person."
Faillace claims that the backgrounds of Math 2 students cover
a compete spectrum. "Some have had just one year of high
school math; others four years but a long time ago. There are
even people who flunked Math 5 because they couldn't picture
the material as well as memorizing the formulas."
Deleeuw emphasizes that Math 2 was designed to "make the
brain work." He points out that this type of visual reasoning is
"ideal" for students in psychology, biology, and other social
sciences as well as humanities.
Lax Attitude
Because of Deleeuw's lax attitude, Math 2 may seem an easy
course, but Deleeuw says it's only easy to those who are too
advanced for the class. "To people who are right for the course,
it's really a hard course and a guy who's in the course for four

easy units has come to the wrong place." No one has ever been
asked to leave if the material has been too easy for him, because,
says Deleeuw, "That's his decision."
Deleeuw is pleased with the progress of the 75 students in the
class this quarter. The 75 are aided by student course consultants,
advanced students who know the material and meet with other
students in smaller groups to verify their work and supplement
the tri-weekly class sessions.
Dan Rudolf, TA for Math 2, who works closely with the
consultants and prepared much of the current course material,
describes the consultant's role as a difficult one: "It's hard to
state specific rules or policies. You have to fall back on some
intuition about people and the look in their eye."
Show Concern
Although the consultants enroll in Math 195 and receive three
units which count as elective units toward a math major, Deleeuw
insists that a knowledge of mathematics is not alone sufficient to
be a good consultant. "The best consultants show concern for
students — that's more important than their background. Some of
the best consultants will ultimately be people who have gone
through the course." Deleeuw says the "ideal situation" will be a
one to one ratio between students and consultants.
Chris Canellos, senior math major, who has been a consultant
since the beginning of the course, describes the job as "a
completely different experience each quarter" and praises the
"close contact with people" aspect of the course as "very
important to life."

Deleeuw believes education should be very close to life. Even
now, he participates in education not only as a teacher but also a
student. Currently, he is taking karate at Stanford. Faillace
jokingly says, "That evolved when he used to teach a standard
math course and grades were an issue between him and the
students."
While Deleeuw believes Math 2 is "a great learning
experience," he also believes that it's fun. He believes all learning
should be fun, and that is a prime reason he stands so strongly
behind Math 2. He feels it is a major step in the right direction.
Apparently both faculty and students agree. Although Math 2
is an experimental course, Berg says it will continue as long as
students show interest and consultants demonstrate concern.
According to Weiner,"There should be more of this type of
experimentation throughout Stanford. A lot could go on."
Student Reactions
Student reactions to the course are also positive. They call
Math 2 "informal, non-competitive, low-pressure" and describe
its professor as "cool, down-to-earth."
Canellos added, "He's more one of the guys than almost any
professor I've ever met. And he makes all the math seem so
simple. That's why he's great."
The most damning comment came from a freshman who said,
"I can't read Deleeuw's handwriting."
But Deleeuw promises even that will improve. "I appreciate all
criticism. It helps make things better.
"This course will probably never be perfect," he said, "but
we'll keep trying."
