# Prof Makes Math Less Intimidating

### GEORGE DOBBINS 
The sign reads:
$10 straight lecture
$ 15 topless lecture
$20 give the professor a lecture
"ask about our specials "
The door leads into office 382N in the mathematics
department. Pasted around the sign are two cartoon figures asking
each other "Are you thinking?," other quotations including "In
God We Trust" and a series of drawings entitled 'The 13Facesof
Karel Deleeuw," created by his young son Eric.
There are not really 13 faces there anymore. Some have been
taken down. Those that remain cast Deleeuw in roles ranging
from martian to magician to clown to professor.
Clad in blue jeans and a red sport shirt and seated at his desk
amidst papers scattered on the floor, Deleeuw, bearded and
appearing in his late forties, does indeed defy the professorial
archetype. But the three rows of calculus books lining his shelves
coupled with his Princeton Ph.D. and 15 years experience here
serve as proof that Deleeuw has participated in the educational
process long enough to criticize its methods.
While teaching required mathematics courses, Deleeuw first
came to grips with students frustrated by courses they didn't
want to take.
Hidden Curriculum
He recalls classes "crammed full of people who hated math less
than they hated French and that was terrible." Deleeuw then
thought about the educational problems and discovered the
" 'hidden curriculum.' That's all about how you need experts to
xplain things to you. It's the main thing you learn in school —
that you can't figure out things for yourself.
"Perhaps there should be a required course in how to think,
but I don't know who's competent to teach it. Besides, I certainly
don't want to teach another course that's required," he says.
A year and a half ago, his thinking reached fruition. Based on

discussions with other professors advocating "science for the
non-scientist," he came up with an idea for how best to teach
math, to students previously intimidated or frustrated by it.
His goal was to "help students who could not analyze
problems, to emphasize understanding, visualization, figuring
things out. And most important, to instill a sense of confidence in
their minds — to show them they could do it."
Create Confidence
To create that confidence Deleeuw advocates cooperation
rather than competition, allowing students to communicate with
and learn from each other in small groups. He lectures, only
infrequently to avoid the students feeling "that this is just one
more lesson and I need him to explain it to me." Mainly, he
answers questions. Students earn grades on the basis of completed
work rather than tests because Deleeuw believes a course is
"much more comfortable if 1 can say to students, 'this is what
you do for a B and this for an A.' "
After he formulated his ideas he took them to math Ph.D.
candidate Phil Faillace, already a Ph.D. in philosophy. Faillace
recalls, "We wanted to give people whose experiences in
mathematics haven't been pleasant a chance to get satisfaction
that mathematicians and scientists get when they solve a
problem." Faillace helped Deleeuw prepare course outlines and
notes. Then came the hard part — getting financial support.
For that, Deleeuw approached Martin Weiner, assistant to the
dean of undergraduate studies. Weiner now reflects, "I liked it
immediately. It took an interesting approach, teaching algebra
and trig to students who worked closely with each other."
Department response was "extremely positive," according to
Deleeuw. And Math Department Y' ce Chairman Paul Berg
confirms that fact, calling the idea "most certainly desirable."
Thus Deleeuw conceived and began Math 2, one of the most
innovative courses here. Four quarters have passes since the
course's inception and 250 students have passed the curriculum.
