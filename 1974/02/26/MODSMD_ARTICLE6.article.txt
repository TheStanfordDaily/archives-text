Electrical Cycles
Editor:
In the article "Electric Cycles
Developed," from a few weeks
ago, you slighted the motorcycles
Kaylor Energy Products are selling
now and neglected to mention
their most important aspects.
These two-battery motorcycles
were described as having "poor
acceleration" and as being "the
size of a minibike." You quoted
the "Energy Buggies" man as
saying, "What we don't need is
more motorcycles."
I used to hate motorcycles, gas
ones, because they make noise
and are always being driven too
fast. Electric cycles (such as the
one I use from Kaylor Energy
Products) are not like that. They
quietly accelerate to their top
speed of thirty as quickly as you
would want. If it accelerates
poorly, it has not been charged up
fully.
If you plug it into house
current overnight, you can use it
all day. I do errands all over the
Mid-Peninsula on one, feeling
balanced and safe, not buzzed
out. It is really a delight to drive a
quiet vehicle.
It is larger than a minibike,
comparable to the Honda CT-70. I
sort of see it as my futuristic
horse. I can see now how people
get off on the feeling that "My
bike is ma horse." But this horse
doesn't suck attention like a
rodeo. Its to get your places really
easy, like gliding. There are no
gears, so it takes minimum
coordination to handle; just
throttle on handlebar and two
handbrakes like on a bicycle. Its
really a good trip and would ease
a lot of local traffic problems if
widely used.

TA Unions
Editor:
Your coverage of the attempt
by teaching and research assistants
to unionize has been consistently
confused on one point. There are
two unions involved.
One is the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (which you
have consistently mislabled the
"Stanford Union of Research
Assistants") and the other is the
Stanford Teaching and Research
Employees Union. The first
union, which consists of research
assistants in the Physics
Department, has been organizing
for at least six months and has a
hearing before the NLRB next
month.
The second union which
consists of graduate teaching and
research employees in the School
of Humanities and Sciences has
only recently constituted itself
and begun its organizing effort.
Both unions are concerned with
salaries and conditions of graduate
employment and do not intend
"to set faculty and 'faculty's own'
graduate students in any adversary
relationship," as President Lyman
is quoted as saying.
Graduate employees are
presently powerless in dealing
with the University and collective
organization is intended to
improve their position in
bargaining over presently meager
salaries.

Searsville Bikeway
Editor:
Over the past decade Stanford
has pioneered in providing
facilities to meet the needs of
growing numbers of bicycles. In
addition to developing pathway
standards (many of which have
been adopted by other universities
and communities), a total of 10.4
miles of separate bicycle/
pedestrian pathways has been
constructed on campus.

These pathways have been
built in accordance with priorities
established by numerous
individual cyclists, various student
groups and assorted University
committees. To the best of my
knowledge the only adverse
comments received stressed the
fact that more paths were not
being provided sooner.
It was with some surprise,
therefore, that I saw the recently
completed Searsville path
described in the Stanford Daily as
a "strip of asphalt which now
blights what was once a stretch of
beautiful country lane." The
intent of this installation was to
provide a safe, all-weather
pathway which could be readily
identified and inexpensively
maintained. The path was
deliberately placed to one side of
the existing roadway to protect it
from damage by service vehicles
or unauthorized traffic.
It is to be hoped that the
benefits provided Stanford
students and staff en route to and
from Menlo Park via this new
pathway will offset any visual
changes it may have caused in the
area.

Still Streaking
Editor.
Presumably, and according to
faculty lecturer Peterson's letter
in the Feb. 11 Daily, he was so
"shocked and disgusted" by
"streaking" that his grasp of the
English language suffered a
relapse.
I suggest that should he tear
himself away from his computer
keyboard long enough to leaf
through any standard English
language dictionary he will find
that the word he sought was
"depravity," rather than the
non-existent "depravation."
Hopefully, he is more adept at
computer-programming than with
English diction.

I would like to correct a
possibly mistaken impression
some readers of the Daily may
have gotten in the first paragraph
of the article on the health care
program at Stanford in Britain
planned for the Summer Quarter,
1975 (Daily, Feb. 21). The theme,
"Health Care and Public Policy,"
has been specifically designed to
attract a group of 30 pre-medical
students and 10 or so medical
students, and other
undergraduates who are
concerned about the socological,
economic, psychological, and
political implications of varieties
of health care delivery systems. In
addition, however, there will be a
regular general studies program
open to students who want an
introductory exposure to British
culture and history; those in the
health care program will be able
to take courses from the general
studies curriculum, and those not
interested in the health care
program will be able to take the
regular general studies courses.
The health care program is a
specific focus curriculum within
the larger, general, British culture
and history curriculum at
Stanford in Britain for the
summer of 1975.
I want also to take this
opportunity to thank Don Cox
for his good humor, patience, and
accurate reporting; he has seen a
lot of our office in the last few
weeks, and we appreciate the
honest and fair job he has done.
