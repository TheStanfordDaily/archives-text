# Chris Murray And Student Power

Perhaps you've seen one tacked up on
your dorm's bulletin board or plastered
somewhere in the Quad. In huge type across
the top of the 8"xl5" sheet it reads: "Chris
Murray Reports," and you may have asked
yourself, "who is he?"
Chris L. Murray is a junior majoring in
political science who identifies himself as
president of the Associated Students of
Stanford for Action. Murray also apparently
intends to run for ASSU President in April.
Dean of Student Affairs James W. Lyons
says Murray formed his organization
"sometime toward the end of last quarter."
Lyons believes that the ASSA is "a small
group, if it's a group at all. I kind of have a
hunch that if he left, his group would too,"
Lyons says.
Lyons' assistant, Dale Snape, says that
Murray requested funding from the Dean's
office for the ASSA. Snape turned Murray
down, at that time expressing his belief that
Murray was merely using the ASSA to
further his own political ambitions. Murray
later said he did not disagree with Snape's
conclusion.
In a Feb. 14 column on this page, Murray
claimed that "I've worked with three
successive ASSU administrations." However,

incumbent ASSU Vice President Beth
Garfield says"he has not worked with us and
I doubt very seriously whether he worked
with any of our predecessors."
Although Murray has a desk in the ASSU
office, Garfield says "none of us know very
much about him. I've never seen anyone
working with him [on ASSA matters]," she
adds. Observers do say that Murray regularly
attends ASSU Senate meetings and makes
frequent remarks there.
Chris Murray is constantly calling for
"Student Power," which he says is
"something very needed within the Stanford
Community." What Murray and other
student power advocates fail to recognize is
that students already have considerable
influence in setting University policy.
Academic Secretary H. Donald Winbigler,
who oversees the work of the various
University committees, says"the members of
[Academic] Council committees regard the
contributions of their student colleagues as
being very significant."
According to Winbigler, "most of the
student influence [on the committees] is not
through muscle flexing. It is through opening
people's minds to things."
He goes on to point out that students'

"best contributions often come before lines
are drawn. In some instances, faculty views
are changed and sometimes the students'
views are changed, all because of the give and
take" in committee sessions.
Winbigler believes that harping endlessly
about student power will have the effect of
"putting students in an adversary relationship
with the faculty." Such a relationship would
tend to reduce, rather than increase, student
power, Winbigler says.
For too long, students inside and outside
the ASSU have cried out for student power,
without having anything specific in mind and
without realizing how much power they
already have.
In any case, students should not expect to
run the University single handedly. There is
at least some validity to the Administration's
claim that the transient nature of the student
body tends to reduce the importance of its
input vis a vis the other constituencies on
campus.
Students must appreciate the more
permanent interests which the University's
faculty, staff and Administration have in the
future of Stanford.
