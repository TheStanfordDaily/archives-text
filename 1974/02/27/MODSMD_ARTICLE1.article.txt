# Law Officials Suspect Future SLA Attacks

If the Symbionese Liberation Army
survives the Patricia Hearst kidnaping,
state law enforcement officials fear
that it will go hunting for even bigger
game.
These officials told the Daily last
week they believe the SLA has already
slated its next three targets:
— those who helped convict two
revolutionaries of murder in
connection with an October, 1972
prison escape near Chino;
— Huey Newton, leader of the
Black Panthers;
— Raymond Procunier, director of
California's prison system.
Just when the SLA will move
against any of these people, officials
do not know; but they say they are
certain the SLA will try to unless most
of the group's members are captured
during the Patricia Hearst
investigation.
Foster Killing
The SLA, which claims to be a
multi-racial revolutionary group, first
surfaced last November when it
claimed credit for the gangland-style
murder of Dr. Marcus Foster,
superintendent of Oakland schools.
Foster was involved in a dispute
over identification cards for Oakland
public school students.
Then, on Feb. 4, Patricia Hearst,
daughter of San Francisco Examiner
Editor Randolph A. Hearst, was
kidnaped, and the SLA again claimed
credit, this time providing tape
recordings of Hearst's daughter as
proof.
The SLA has since demanded $6
million in free food for the poor as a
"good will gesture" before negotiating
the return of Patricia Hearst.
And state officials say they don't
think its spectacular actions will end
there.
Burt Case
They believe the SLA will soon go
after those who were connected, in
one way or another, with the
conviction of Benton Douglas Burt
and Andrea Holman Burt — a former
Venceremos member and daughter of
Medical School Prof. Halsted Holman
— in a prison escape over a year ago
that left one guard dead and another
wounded.
Venceremos is a Maoist
revolutionary group, now apparently
defunct, that for over two years
operated in the Bay Area.
The two are both serving prison
terms after being convictcd of second
degree murder in an ambush that freed
Ronald Wayne Beaty from custody at
the California Institution for Men near
Chino.
Trial
Two other ex-members of
Venceremos, Jean Hobson and Robert
Seabock, are now on trial in Southern
California in connection with the
escape.
Beaty was recaptured, and his
testimony was the primary
prosecution weapon in convicting the
Burts. Now state law enforcement
officials say Beaty may be a marked
man.
Procunier is also believed a.
potential target of SLA retribution.
The two prime suspects in the Hearst
kidnaping are both escapees from

California prisons, and officials say a
number of other SLA members also
may be former inmates.
During Procunier's tenure as
director of the Department of
Corrections, he has cracked down
repeatedly on prison gangs in an effort
to control violence inside the
institutions.
Panther Involvement
The third figure on the SLA "hit
list" — Black Panther leader Huey
Newton — is a bit harder to explain.
The SLA designated the Panthers as
one of the groups to oversee the
Hearst food distribution. Why would it
enlist the Panthers' aid on one hand
and plot to kill their leader on the
other?
Officials offer one explanation for
the apparent animosity toward
Newton. Along with some of those
familiar with Bay Area radical groups,
they speculate that it stems from a
1971 split in the Panthers.
In that split, one group, led by
now-exiled Eldridge Cleaver renounced
peaceful politics and argued that
armed struggle was the only viable
weapon of the revolution.
The other faction, led by Newton
and currently operating out of
Oakland, said it was unrealistic to urge
violent tactics against a militarily
superior force during an age of
repression. This group liquidated its
underground military arm and moved
more and more into community
service programs and traditional
politics.
The Oakland group operates child
care centers, free breakfast programs,
and actually got a candidate for mayor
— Bobby Seale — into a runoff
election last spring.
Viciously Bitter
The 1971 split was viciously bitter;
some reports have circulated that
leaders of the two factions tried to
have each other assassinated. The
fallout among radical groups was
tremendous: Venceremos, for
instance, split in two over the Panther
dispute, with one faction denouncing
the other as "racist sissies."
Venceremos' leadership had strong
pro-Cleaver elements, but the group
initially denounced both Panther
factions, and a number of pro-Newton
members resigned. Last fall, when
Venceremos was breaking up, the
group's Central Committee issued a
statement de-emphasizing urban
guerilla violence as a routine political
tool.
Some observers believe Venceremos
may have split again over this final
statement, with some members
refusing to accept this new, more
pacifistic stance. This
violence-oriented splinter group may
have provided the impetus for the
creation of the SLA.
This division and counter-division
in the world of radical politics provide
the only apparent motivation for the
SLA's decision to move against
Newton. An overtly terrorist
organization, the SLA would probably
sympathize with Cleaver's
military-oriented faction of the Black
Panthers.
Would it still make a difference,
three years after the split in the
Panthers? Officials believe so. The
division created such hatred on both
sides that rival members still refuse to
have anything to do with one another.
Cleaver's faction ended up on the
bottom, its leader out of the country
and its control of Black Panther
communication apparatus gone.
