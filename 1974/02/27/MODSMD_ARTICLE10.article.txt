# Free Market' Medicine Illogical

Bruce Smyth's dogged defense of "free
market" medical practice rests upon these
assumptions:
1) the removal of graduation from an
accredited medical school from the
requirements for licensure would prompt the
creation of new medical schools;
2) new medical schools could be created
and maintained at a cost below expanding
present schools because the new ones could
offer varying kinds of medical training, many
less expensive to provide;
3) competition among all medical schools
would drive the cost of medical education
down;
4) competition among the physicians
produced as a result would drive the cost of
medical care down;
5) protection against quacks would be by
a consumer's judgment of the physician's
medical reputation and by greater health
institution caution in choice of staff.
Assumptions Faulty
With the possible exception of the first, all
of these assumptions are faulty.
One wonders where the start-up capital
would come from to create new medical
schools teaching anything but the most basic
courses, but let us assume it would come. To
compete, Smyth suggests they would offer
medical instruction less costly to provide
than at present.
The problem with this is why these
smaller programs should entitle one to the
title of physician. The increased use of
paraprofessionals is a solution to the medical
manpower problem that deserves, and is
getting serious attention. But why call a

paraprofessional a physician?
If a paraprofessional's training is limited,
let his responsibilities be limited also. Let
him take duties of screening, prephysician
work-up, and more menial tasks from the
shoulders of the physician, but let him work
in harmony with someone trained in the full
range of medical knowledge, rather than as
an inadequate substitute.
Possible Disaster
Why risk the disaster of an uninformed
person's going to a "doctor" inadequate to
the patient's problem, when the simple
creation of a new category of health
paraprofessional, with limited
responsibilities, can reduce the manpower
problem while maintaining safety?
Even more puzzling is Smyth's contention
that competition, that magic word, would
drive down the cost of both medical
education and medical care.
Although at present close to one-third of
American physicians licensed annually come
from overseas medical schools, this
competition does not seem to have lowered
medical school costs.
Would Market Glut Help?
But even if so large a number of schools
appeared that the market were glutted with
institutions, would the cost at the major
schools decline? Since Smyth admits that the
extent of the curricula would have to differ
because of cost, doesn't it follow that the
costs of different institutions would continue
to differ also?
Competition would not drive costs down,
then, only add inferior programs for less
money. The same would be true for medical

care. Smyth admits that health institutions
and informed consumers would have to be
more selective in physician choice. Doesn't a
differential pay scale based on level of
training follow? The new trainees would
compete with the old only to the extent that
they could immorally mask their deficiencies.
It is interesting to mention, at this point,
that Smyth completely missed one of my
main arguments in his rejoinder, namely, that
the rich would monopolize the well-trained
and expensive physicians, while the poor
would take a chance with the care they could
afford, as they do now. A number of risky
alternatives to medicine do exist, you know;
or maybe you don't, if you've never been
poor.
Rich-Poor Split
This rich-poor split is how the layers of
medical care would settle into the society. In
the same way, the rich would have the
protection of prosecuting a malpractice suit,
while for many of the poor this would be an
impossible effort.
We are left asking ourselves why Bruce
Smyth tenaciously clings to his idea, given
the risks to human life inherent in it. Could it
be because his political and economic views
color his perception?
As the idea of the free market becomes
increasingly at variance with the realities of
the new industrial state's economy, are
conservatives grasping for new applications
for their tired notions? Wouldn't it be more
simple to find a theory that fits the evidence
than the other way around?
