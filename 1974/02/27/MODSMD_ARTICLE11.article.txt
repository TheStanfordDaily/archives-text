# Ecology: A Real Solution

Why worry about the rapidly
deteriorating environment of the
United States and other affluent
countries and the quality of the
air and wate» that is gradually
becoming poorer? How shallow is
your trust in Him that you should
fear for your pitiful lives that
harm should come. The Word will
be carried out.
Do you remember the past,
or think about old things.
Look: I am doing a new thing—
don't you see it?
Isaiah 43:18-9
These are only shadows of what is
coming: and it is Christ who casts
the shadows.
Colossians 2:17
Can you dig it? It's part of The
Big Plan. Can't you see that? You
worry yourselves silly and run
about raising so much hell that
you miss Church. If you would
read the Big Book, you'd know
about the significance this present
situation has in the scheme of
things.
He set forth his purpose in
Christ, a plan for the fullness (
of time to make all things one
in him.
Ephesians 1:9-10
So you see, all this
environmental trouble is not
caused by man's greed. In fact, it
is man's responsibility to make
sure he carries out The Big Plan.
So pollute. The sooner we get this
part of the game over with the
sooner we can go on to the next
part. By holding off or, worse yet,
trying to avoid the impending
destruction of the Earth, we are
only avoiding our meeting with
Him. So the problem, you see, is
not that the End is at Hand
(because that's supposed to
happen), but that there are so
many unbelievers who are going
to lose their asses.
Whoever denies me before men
will be denied before God's
angels by the Son of Man.
Luke 12:9-10
So, what it comes down to is
that we're going to go whether we
like it or not. As soon as you
ecologists face up to reality, you
can start to work on the Real
Solution — The Salvation of Your
Ass! And man, you can't save
your own ass. God's got to save it
for you.
The power at work in us is the
same power of God which
raised Christ from the dead.
Ephesians 1:19-20
(The power at work, dig it?)
He saved Jesus' and He can save
yours.
