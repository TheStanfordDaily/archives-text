# Letters: Honey Shots' Evoke Controversy

### 
Compliment To Females
Editor:
We would like to state that
Bob Murphy's defense of the
Stanford co-eds should be
construed as a compliment rather
than as an affront to the female
sex. While it is definitely not right
to judge a person from his or her
looks, it is certainly nice to know
that someone cared enough for
the girls at Stanford to defend us.
It is hardly a question of
whether we "need or want" to be
defended. Rather than blow the
whole issue out of proportion by
interpreting every statement made
by Sidaris and Murphy with dead
earnest, Sidaris' comments should
be taken as out of line and
Murphy's defense as a friendly
gesture.
As for the "archaic attitudes"
and "unrealistic views," we're
willing to bet that nine out of ten
times the Ms.(s) who wrote the
letter to the editor will not
exactly ignore a foxy-looking guy
walking down the other side of
the street.

Unwitting Martyr
Editor:
For some inexplicable reason,
Stanford women do not desire to
be portrayed as being pretty. It
seems being pretty, and
permitting others to acknowledge
it, somehow conflicts with the
more "liberated" image of a
woman that Garfield and
company hold.
Just because a pretty girl is
photographed with a well-known
"jock," she immediately becomes

"a misrepresentative, insulting and
derogatory image of Stanford
women." Had she never been
photographed, she would have
been just another pretty face.
Instead, she has become an
unwitting martyr to an
unliberation movement.

Sexist 'Defense'
Editor:
When I picked up the San
Francisco Chronicle sports section
Feb. 20 and learned that cute
Stanford "honeys" did in fact
abound, I suppose I should have
been proud. But I wasn't. I was
insulted. Insulted partially
because the Chronicle thought
that such nonsense was worth my
reading.
But mostly I was insulted
because Stanford sports publicist
Bob Murphy had tried to disprove
a charge from Andy Sidaris of
Sports Illustrated magazine that
Stanford women "dressed in a
style I can only describe as early
War of 1812" by providing the
press with pictures of attractive
Stanford women.
Murphy may have been well
intentioned in trying to defend
the beauty of Stanford women.
His defense, however, was sexist
and inappropriate.
Murphy's portrayal of Stanford
women as physical objects is
directly contrary to Stanford's
avowed efforts to eradicate sexism
in the University. Murphy was
correct in responding to Sidaris'
insulting comments, but instead
of frantically racing around the
University trying to photograph
pretty girls as a public relations
gimmick, Murphy should have
pointed to the real

accomplishments of Stanford
women as intellectuals, athletes,
and active community citizens.
In the future I hope Murphy
and the Athletics Department will
stop trying to defend the sacred
honor of Stanford women and
will devote their energies toward
trying to act as an enlightened
force to counter the inaccurate
and unfortunate female
stereotypes that exist at Stanford
and in the general society.

Male 'Honey Shots'
Editor:
Just as a university is to be
judged by the beauty of its
women, so is a newspaper to be
judged by the beauty of its men.
Please send me "honey" shots of
all your male staff members,
preferably in the nude. Thank
you.

Solution Suggested
Editor:
In regard to two of Stanford's
most pressing problems,
admissions criteria and "honey
shots" (or lack thereof) we would
like to suggest a solution.
First, we would like to
congratulate Bob Murphy for
saving Stanford's reputation with
the photos of ten honeys at our
weekend sporting events. Bob and
his photographer did some fine
work tracing down some of the
gorgeous Foothill College girls
who frequently bless Stanford
sports.
Imagine what might happen if
this serious shortage of
good-looking Stanford women

became known to the other
networks, and lucrative sports
telecasting ceased. No one wants
to see just the games, and until
women's field hockey replaces the
Pac-8 Game of the Week, good
looking females, Stanford women
not withstanding, are a must at
men's athletic events.
We sympathize with the
surplus of admission applicants
that Dean Hargadon must deal
with. Too many female applicants
are a problem, but we cannot
condone his apparent desire to
keep the campus attitude
scholarly by keeping it devoide of
sexually stimulating females,
through discriminating practices
in the acceptance procedure. We

remind the dean that class action
suits have been filed before on
behalf of beleagured minorities.
Please stop using those freshman
photos to weed out good looking
females.
Finally, we would like to
commend Bond, Garfield,
Jones, et al, for the one valid
point in their Feb. 19 letter to the
Daily. Women's sports should
receive space in the Daily similar
to the "way the original article
appeared, specially boxed, and
with a caption" to quote their
letter, and located, as is the article
that started this ridiculousness, in
a paragraph summary on page 7.
