# Energy Cuts Saving

University News Service
Since Nov. 1, Stanford's energy conservation program has saved
$167,000 in fuel and electrical costs, according to Dan DeYoung,
plant services director and program coordinator.
Compared to the previous year, the savings include nearly 6.5
million kilowatt hours of electricity and nearly 1.5 million therms of
fuel. These savings together are equivalent to 33,250 barrels of oil.
During late January and February, electrical consumption was cut
25 percent and fuel 21 percent over last year's levels, he reported.
"This is a tremendous tribute to the widespread sustained
cooperation of all members of the campus community," DeYoung
said.
Stanford's achievements substantially exceed the 15 percent
reduction in energy use recommended by many public officials. But
DeYoung points out that sustained reductions in energy usage will be
needed to avoid future supply shortages.
Even with sharply curtailed consumption, the University's energy
bills have increased because of sharply rising rates for electricity and
fuel.
Seth M. Bodner, deputy assistant secretary for the U.S.
Department of Commerce, has called the results of Stanford's
conservation program "very impressive and encouraging."
In a letter to Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger, Bodner said:
"You evidently have full cooperation of the entire University
community, and have set an outstanding example which we hope
other academic institutions will follow."
