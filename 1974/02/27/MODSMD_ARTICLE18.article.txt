# John Denver Brings Country Love To City Fans
## 
### ROD KOON 
SAN FRANCISCO — It was a
night of music, and songs of
mountains, country, humor,
Colorado, peace, home, and love,
all in one. It was the night of the
John Denver concert.
Saturday night at Civic
Auditorium, Denver played to a
full house in his 11:30 concert,
his second of the evening.
Though the strain of this
rigorous evening might have
shown on another performer, it
certainly was not visible on
Denver. He came on stage as fresh
as ever, as if he drew his vitality
and energy from his enthusiastic
audience.
Opening with his hit
"Starwood in Aspen," he sang, "I
tell you I'm happy to be here/ to
share and consider the time/ for I
see here the shadows of changes/
and a feeling of new friends to
find/ and I see here some new
friends tonight."
Good Raport
And he really did seem glad to
be there. Aside from his songs, he
maintained a good raport with his
captive audience with occasional
comments between songs, which
varied from comic to serious
commentary at times.
He invited the audience to sing
along with the songs they knew.
"But please limit yourself to the
choruses," he added jokingly, "I'll
do the verses. After all, it's my
show."
After doing "Mother Nature's
Son," the Beatles' song which
seems to fit Denver better than
anyone else, he played his current
hit, "Sunshine," which he said, "I
wrote on a rainy day in
Minnesota."
Accompanying Denver onstage
in this first set were Steve

Weisberg on acoustic and steel
guitar, John Summers on banjo,
and Dick Connis on bass. In
addition, three screens flanked the
performers, where movies and
slides were shown to provide
visual complements to the song
lyrics.
New Album
After switching from 12-string
to six-string guitar, Denver
introduced three new selections,
which he plans to include on his
newest album coming out in
March. One was entitled
"Matthew." Another was a slow
love song to his wife, who, like
the Rocky Mountains, provides
great inspiration for his life and
songs.
The last one, "Back Home
Again," the tentative title of the
new album, was played with a
steel guitar adding a pleasant
country flavor. The song deals
with a familiar subject in many of
Denver's efforts — home.
Aside from "Goodbye Again,"
and "Rocky Mountain Suite," his
first set included a lively tune,
"Thank God I'm a Country Boy,"
a real country song. Fine fiddle
playing together with the song's
frantic pace had the excited
audience clapping along
throughout. Finishing that,
Denver smiled and yelled, "I love
it!" An audience member replied,
"We do, too!"
Overall, the sellout crowd was
a cross-section of ages,
personalities,and dress styles,from
tuxes to blue jeans. Viewing the
masses of teenie boppers and
middle-aged couples, one could
see how widespread and
diversified Denver's appeal is.
One of the few audience
outbursts came when one girl
yelled, "Play 'My Sweet Lady'

one of these times!" Denver, in a
classic reply, said, "I promise you,
we know exactly what we're
doing up here."
Denver finished off his first set
with a flawless performance of
"The Eagle and the Hawk."
Though his voice had faltered
briefly on an earlier song, he
belted out this powerful vocal
without a problem. Together with
accompanying slides and movie,
this one song beautifully captured
the power and magnificence of
the eagle.
Denver returned alone after a
brief break for his second set. He
started with "My Sweet Lady,"
which puts Cliff DeYoung's
shoddy AM version to shame, and
followed it with a recitation of
the anti-war parable, "The Box,"
and then a moving anti-war song,
"Jimmy Noonan." As the
applause subsided, he added, "It
just amazes me that in all the
years of our existence, we haven't
learned that wars simply don't
work."
Shifting to a lighter vein after
singing "Rhymes and Reasons,"
Denver displayed his juggling
prowess, which was limited. He
explained, "The first time I
juggled I was in London, England,
in concert with the Moody
Blues... . People there didn't
know who John Denver was, or
where I was from, or what I had
written, and they didn't care. 1
thought, 'Aha, a perfect time to
break in my juggling act.' Made a
fool of myself before 12,000

people. But theyknow who I am
now."
His backup group returned,
and aside from playing some of
his greatest hits, "Rocky
Mountain High," "Poems, Prayers,
and Promises," "Welcome to My
Morning," "Take Me Home,
Country Roads," they played an
inspired rendition of the bluegrass
classic, "Foggy Mountain
Breakdown."
After he had said farewell, a
standing ovation brought Denver
back on stage alone, where he had
been in the spotlight for over four
hours that night. And yet, he still
was happy, smiling, and lively.
As he explained, "These two
and one-half hours that I get to
spend with you art 1 a source of
more joy and happiness in my life
... if it weren't for you, I
wouldn't have anybody to sing
to." He finished with the song, "I
Guess He'd Rather be in
Colorado."
Throughout the concert,
Denver was able to profess and
share his love of nature, peace, the
wilderness, his wife (who was in
the crowd at both concerts) with
the audience. He is a man in love
with life in its fullest sense, and all
that life can be and should be.
Earlier in the evening, in the
song "Goodbye, Again," Denver
sang, "I have to go and see some
friends of mine, some that I don't
know . . . it's anyone who'll listen
to me sing." If that's the case,
then he gained a few thousand
new friends that night.

his second of the evening.
Though the strain of this
rigorous evening might have
shown on another performer, it
certainly was not visible on
Denver. He came on stage as fresh
as ever, as if he drew his vitality
and energy from his enthusiastic
audience.
Opening with his hit
"Starwood in Aspen," he sang, "I
tell you I'm happy to be here/ to
share and consider the time/ for I
see here the shadows of changes/
and a feeling of new friends to
find/ and I see here some new
friends tonight."
Good Raport
And he really did seem glad to
be there. Aside from his songs, he
maintained a good raport with his
captive audience with occasional
comments between songs, which
varied from comic to serious
commentary at times.
He invited the audience to sing
along with the songs they knew.
"But please limit yourself to the
choruses," he added jokingly, "I'll
do the verses. After all, it's my
show."
After doing "Mother Nature's
Son," the Beatles' song which
seems to fit Denver better than
anyone else, he played his current
hit, "Sunshine," which he said, "I
wrote on a rainy day in
Minnesota."
Accompanying Denver onstage
in this first set were Steve

Weisberg on acoustic and steel
guitar, John Summers on banjo,
and Dick Connis on bass. In
addition, three screens flanked the
performers, where movies and
slides were shown to provide
visual complements to the song
lyrics.
New Album
After switching from 12-string
to six-string guitar, Denver
introduced three new selections,
which he plans to include on his
newest album coming out in
March. One was entitled
"Matthew." Another was a slow
love song to his wife, who, like
the Rocky Mountains, provides
great inspiration for his life and
songs.
The last one, "Back Home
Again," the tentative title of the
new album, was played with a
steel guitar adding a pleasant
country flavor. The song deals
with a familiar subject in many of
Denver's efforts — home.
Aside from "Goodbye Again,"
and "Rocky Mountain Suite," his
first set included a lively tune,
"Thank God I'm a Country Boy,"
a real country song. Fine fiddle
playing together with the song's
frantic pace had the excited
audience clapping along
throughout. Finishing that,
Denver smiled and yelled, "I love
it!" An audience member replied,
"We do, too!"
Overall, the sellout crowd was
a cross-section of ages,
personalities,and dress styles,from
tuxes to blue jeans. Viewing the
masses of teenie boppers and
middle-aged couples, one could
see how widespread and
diversified Denver's appeal is.
One of the few audience
outbursts came when one girl
yelled, "Play 'My Sweet Lady'

one of these times!" Denver, in a
classic reply, said, "I promise you,
we know exactly what we're
doing up here."
Denver finished off his first set
with a flawless performance of
"The Eagle and the Hawk."
Though his voice had faltered
briefly on an earlier song, he
belted out this powerful vocal
without a problem. Together with
accompanying slides and movie,
this one song beautifully captured
the power and magnificence of
the eagle.
Denver returned alone after a
brief break for his second set. He
started with "My Sweet Lady,"
which puts Cliff DeYoung's
shoddy AM version to shame, and
followed it with a recitation of
the anti-war parable, "The Box,"
and then a moving anti-war song,
"Jimmy Noonan." As the
applause subsided, he added, "It
just amazes me that in all the
years of our existence, we haven't
learned that wars simply don't
work."
Shifting to a lighter vein after
singing "Rhymes and Reasons,"
Denver displayed his juggling
prowess, which was limited. He
explained, "The first time I
juggled I was in London, England,
in concert with the Moody
Blues... . People there didn't
know who John Denver was, or
where I was from, or what I had
written, and they didn't care. 1
thought, 'Aha, a perfect time to
break in my juggling act.' Made a
fool of myself before 12,000

people. But theyknow who I am
now."
His backup group returned,
and aside from playing some of
his greatest hits, "Rocky
Mountain High," "Poems, Prayers,
and Promises," "Welcome to My
Morning," "Take Me Home,
Country Roads," they played an
inspired rendition of the bluegrass
classic, "Foggy Mountain
Breakdown."
After he had said farewell, a
standing ovation brought Denver
back on stage alone, where he had
been in the spotlight for over four
hours that night. And yet, he still
was happy, smiling, and lively.
As he explained, "These two
and one-half hours that I get to
spend with you art 1 a source of
more joy and happiness in my life
... if it weren't for you, I
wouldn't have anybody to sing
to." He finished with the song, "I
Guess He'd Rather be in
Colorado."
Throughout the concert,
Denver was able to profess and
share his love of nature, peace, the
wilderness, his wife (who was in
the crowd at both concerts) with
the audience. He is a man in love
with life in its fullest sense, and all
that life can be and should be.
Earlier in the evening, in the
song "Goodbye, Again," Denver
sang, "I have to go and see some
friends of mine, some that I don't
know . . . it's anyone who'll listen
to me sing." If that's the case,
then he gained a few thousand
new friends that night.

tell you I'm happy to be here/ to
share and consider the time/ for I
see here the shadows of changes/
and a feeling of new friends to
find/ and I see here some new
friends tonight."
Good Raport
And he really did seem glad to
be there. Aside from his songs, he
maintained a good raport with his
captive audience with occasional
comments between songs, which
varied from comic to serious
commentary at times.
He invited the audience to sing
along with the songs they knew.
"But please limit yourself to the
choruses," he added jokingly, "I'll
do the verses. After all, it's my
show."
After doing "Mother Nature's
Son," the Beatles' song which
seems to fit Denver better than
anyone else, he played his current
hit, "Sunshine," which he said, "I
wrote on a rainy day in
Minnesota."
Accompanying Denver onstage
in this first set were Steve

Weisberg on acoustic and steel
guitar, John Summers on banjo,
and Dick Connis on bass. In
addition, three screens flanked the
performers, where movies and
slides were shown to provide
visual complements to the song
lyrics.
New Album
After switching from 12-string
to six-string guitar, Denver
introduced three new selections,
which he plans to include on his
newest album coming out in
March. One was entitled
"Matthew." Another was a slow
love song to his wife, who, like
the Rocky Mountains, provides
great inspiration for his life and
songs.
The last one, "Back Home
Again," the tentative title of the
new album, was played with a
steel guitar adding a pleasant
country flavor. The song deals
with a familiar subject in many of
Denver's efforts — home.
Aside from "Goodbye Again,"
and "Rocky Mountain Suite," his
first set included a lively tune,
"Thank God I'm a Country Boy,"
a real country song. Fine fiddle
playing together with the song's
frantic pace had the excited
audience clapping along
throughout. Finishing that,
Denver smiled and yelled, "I love
it!" An audience member replied,
"We do, too!"
Overall, the sellout crowd was
a cross-section of ages,
personalities,and dress styles,from
tuxes to blue jeans. Viewing the
masses of teenie boppers and
middle-aged couples, one could
see how widespread and
diversified Denver's appeal is.
One of the few audience
outbursts came when one girl
yelled, "Play 'My Sweet Lady'

one of these times!" Denver, in a
classic reply, said, "I promise you,
we know exactly what we're
doing up here."
Denver finished off his first set
with a flawless performance of
"The Eagle and the Hawk."
Though his voice had faltered
briefly on an earlier song, he
belted out this powerful vocal
without a problem. Together with
accompanying slides and movie,
this one song beautifully captured
the power and magnificence of
the eagle.
Denver returned alone after a
brief break for his second set. He
started with "My Sweet Lady,"
which puts Cliff DeYoung's
shoddy AM version to shame, and
followed it with a recitation of
the anti-war parable, "The Box,"
and then a moving anti-war song,
"Jimmy Noonan." As the
applause subsided, he added, "It
just amazes me that in all the
years of our existence, we haven't
learned that wars simply don't
work."
Shifting to a lighter vein after
singing "Rhymes and Reasons,"
Denver displayed his juggling
prowess, which was limited. He
explained, "The first time I
juggled I was in London, England,
in concert with the Moody
Blues... . People there didn't
know who John Denver was, or
where I was from, or what I had
written, and they didn't care. 1
thought, 'Aha, a perfect time to
break in my juggling act.' Made a
fool of myself before 12,000

people. But theyknow who I am
now."
His backup group returned,
and aside from playing some of
his greatest hits, "Rocky
Mountain High," "Poems, Prayers,
and Promises," "Welcome to My
Morning," "Take Me Home,
Country Roads," they played an
inspired rendition of the bluegrass
classic, "Foggy Mountain
Breakdown."
After he had said farewell, a
standing ovation brought Denver
back on stage alone, where he had
been in the spotlight for over four
hours that night. And yet, he still
was happy, smiling, and lively.
As he explained, "These two
and one-half hours that I get to
spend with you art 1 a source of
more joy and happiness in my life
... if it weren't for you, I
wouldn't have anybody to sing
to." He finished with the song, "I
Guess He'd Rather be in
Colorado."
Throughout the concert,
Denver was able to profess and
share his love of nature, peace, the
wilderness, his wife (who was in
the crowd at both concerts) with
the audience. He is a man in love
with life in its fullest sense, and all
that life can be and should be.
Earlier in the evening, in the
song "Goodbye, Again," Denver
sang, "I have to go and see some
friends of mine, some that I don't
know . . . it's anyone who'll listen
to me sing." If that's the case,
then he gained a few thousand
new friends that night.
