# Pianist Badura-Skoda Saves Program
## Faulty Conducting Flaws Symphony's Sibelius 
### KENNETH DeLONG 
SAN FRANCISCO - It is
commonplace in musical circles to
say that there are no bad
orchestras, only bad conductors.
The truth of this little saying was
forcibly demonstrated during last
week's San Francisco Symphony
concert series.
Replacing an ailing Joseph
Krips was the young American
conductor John Mauceri who led
the orchestra through a truly
miserable performance of Sibelius'
Symphony No. 2.
The first half of the program
was rescued from disaster by two
external aids: the presence of the
distinguished Viennese pianist
Paul Badura-Skoda and the sheer
brilliance and exhuberance of
Ives' music.

The concert opened with a new
piano concerto (1969) by Swiss
composer Frank Martin,
composed expressly for
Badura-Skoda. It is a three
movement work, and somewhat
conservative by today's standards.
For one thing, each movement
has an easily perceivable and
traditional shape, and the general
stance of the piece reveals its
kinship to virtuoso concertos by
Ravel, Prokofieff and Bartok.
Although the idiom is atonal, the
shaping of the phrases, the
building of large climaxes, and the
virtuoso writing of the solo part
makes the work both intelligible
and thoroughly enjoyable.
Gentle Mood
The slow movement is
particularly successful and spins a
gentle mood crystalized in purple
patches of exquisite and delicious
nuance. In all, it is a thoroughly
satisfying piece of music.
Badura-Skoda performed
brilliantly and was largely
responsible for the success of the
performance. The bravura

passages were played with
confidence and strength, yet his
tone never became harsh or
strident.
The close relationship between
composer and experienced
performer was evidenced in the
blending of Martin's style and
Badura-Skoda's reflective
personality. Conductor John
Mauceri beat a clear 4/4 pattern
but contributed little else to the
performance.
The remainder of the first half
was devoted to the music of
Charles Ives, and consisted of
performances of Three Places in
New England and He is There.
The latter, less than two minutes
in length, mixes a variety of
popular American songs into a
spiky and hilariously gauche
melange.
Three Places in New England, a
major work of Ives, is usually
performed in a version for
chamber orchestra, arranged by
Ives himself. James Sinclair has
attempted a reconstruction of the
"original version" from the

various sources that have survived.
The result is similar to the
usually heard version except for
its fuller texture and denser
sound. It was effectively
performed but its success was
more the result of expert scoring
than expert conducting. Mauceri
did little more than stiffly wave
his stick.
As suggested at the beginning
of this review, it was only in the
second half of the concert that
the full extent of Mauceri's
ineffectiveness became evident.
Sibelius' Second Symphony is
highly romantic and filled with
lush melodies and big exciting
climaxes.
It is music containing many
varied elements which need
unification and control if the full
effect is to be made. It is music in

desperate need of first-class
conducting.
Several years ago, under the
young Finnish conductor Okno
Kamu, the San Francisco
Symphony played this piece to
the hilt, sending the audience
home fairly glowing with delight.
This year's performance was
desperately flawed.
Phrases were stiff, nuance was
completely lacking, and the finals
degenerated into a succession of
vulgar orchestral outbursts. The
lovely opening of the first
movement was destroyed by
ragged entries resulting from
vague, imprecise conducting.
Considering the large number
of talented young conductors
attempting to claw their way out
of obscurity, it was a pity that
this was the choice to replace
Joseph Krips.

building of large climaxes, and the
virtuoso writing of the solo part
makes the work both intelligible
and thoroughly enjoyable.
Gentle Mood
The slow movement is
particularly successful and spins a
gentle mood crystalized in purple
patches of exquisite and delicious
nuance. In all, it is a thoroughly
satisfying piece of music.
Badura-Skoda performed
brilliantly and was largely
responsible for the success of the
performance. The bravura

passages were played with
confidence and strength, yet his
tone never became harsh or
strident.
The close relationship between
composer and experienced
performer was evidenced in the
blending of Martin's style and
Badura-Skoda's reflective
personality. Conductor John
Mauceri beat a clear 4/4 pattern
but contributed little else to the
performance.
The remainder of the first half
was devoted to the music of
Charles Ives, and consisted of
performances of Three Places in
New England and He is There.
The latter, less than two minutes
in length, mixes a variety of
popular American songs into a
spiky and hilariously gauche
melange.
Three Places in New England, a
major work of Ives, is usually
performed in a version for
chamber orchestra, arranged by
Ives himself. James Sinclair has
attempted a reconstruction of the
"original version" from the

various sources that have survived.
The result is similar to the
usually heard version except for
its fuller texture and denser
sound. It was effectively
performed but its success was
more the result of expert scoring
than expert conducting. Mauceri
did little more than stiffly wave
his stick.
As suggested at the beginning
of this review, it was only in the
second half of the concert that
the full extent of Mauceri's
ineffectiveness became evident.
Sibelius' Second Symphony is
highly romantic and filled with
lush melodies and big exciting
climaxes.
It is music containing many
varied elements which need
unification and control if the full
effect is to be made. It is music in

desperate need of first-class
conducting.
Several years ago, under the
young Finnish conductor Okno
Kamu, the San Francisco
Symphony played this piece to
the hilt, sending the audience
home fairly glowing with delight.
This year's performance was
desperately flawed.
Phrases were stiff, nuance was
completely lacking, and the finals
degenerated into a succession of
vulgar orchestral outbursts. The
lovely opening of the first
movement was destroyed by
ragged entries resulting from
vague, imprecise conducting.
Considering the large number
of talented young conductors
attempting to claw their way out
of obscurity, it was a pity that
this was the choice to replace
Joseph Krips.
SAN FRANCISCO - It is
commonplace in musical circles to
say that there are no bad
orchestras, only bad conductors.
The truth of this little saying was
forcibly demonstrated during last
week's San Francisco Symphony
concert series.
Replacing an ailing Joseph
Krips was the young American
conductor John Mauceri who led
the orchestra through a truly
miserable performance of Sibelius'
Symphony No. 2.
The first half of the program
was rescued from disaster by two
external aids: the presence of the
distinguished Viennese pianist
Paul Badura-Skoda and the sheer
brilliance and exhuberance of
Ives' music.

The concert opened with a new
piano concerto (1969) by Swiss
composer Frank Martin,
composed expressly for
Badura-Skoda. It is a three
movement work, and somewhat
conservative by today's standards.
For one thing, each movement
has an easily perceivable and
traditional shape, and the general
stance of the piece reveals its
kinship to virtuoso concertos by
Ravel, Prokofieff and Bartok.
Although the idiom is atonal, the
shaping of the phrases, the
building of large climaxes, and the
virtuoso writing of the solo part
makes the work both intelligible
