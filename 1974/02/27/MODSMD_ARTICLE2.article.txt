# Residents Favor New Plan
## Doty Discusses Terrace Traffic 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Most residents of College Terrace
seem to be willing to try the plan for
traffic reduction endorsed last week
by the Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committee, according to Andrew
Doty, director of Community
Relations in the Department of
University Relations.
"There is a fair acceptance of this
interim plan," Doty declared on
KZSU's weekly Campus Conference
program. "All parties say that this is a
good way to begin to seek a solution."
Doty referred to the Henderson Plan,
co-recommended to the Palo Alto City
Council by the Liaison Committee at a
meeting last Thursday.
Proposed by Councilman Alan
Henderson, the plan, revised slightly
by the Committee, would block off
some streets and set up more stop
signs in College Terrace in an effort to
slow traffic in the area.
'There is a diversity of opinion
regarding the barriers set up by Palo
Alto in September," Doty said. "They
have encouraged people to speak out.
Many believe the existing barriers
should be removed. They aren't very
popular."
Doty emphasized that Stanford is

concerned about the problem in
College Terrace. The heavy volume of
cars with the concomitant noise,
pollution and danger to children is
indeed a problem that the University is
anxious to try to remedy, he said.
Doty expressed disapproval for a
plan suggested by the College Terrace
Resident's Association that would
block off Stanford Avenue to through
traffic.
"Motorists should be allowed to
vote with their steering wheels," Doty
declared. "To arbitrarily set up
barriers, there, would not be
equitable."
Doty added that the proposed
Frenchman's Terrace housing project
would not adversely affect residents of
College Terrace.
'Minimal Impact'
"Its impact would be minimal,"
Doty said. "The existing streets could
handle the additional traffic well."
Frenchman's Terrace will not
damage the character of the region
either, Doty noted. "It is a first rate
project, not a ghetto. It is looked upon
as an innovative approach to the
construction of low to moderate
income housing," he said. "It fits in
with the city's goals."

Doty stressed that the University is
well aware of Palo Alto's fears about
Stanford growth.
Revenue Source
"The city benefits from Stanford,
but it is impacted also," Doty noted.
"Although the existence of Stanford
means a source of revenue for the city,
it also means a gain in traffic.
"Palo Alto residents have looked
around and seen what has happened all
over the state where open land has
been sacrificed for income."
This realization by the University
of the city's anxieties led to the
formation of the Stanford-Palo Alto
Liaison Committee last year.
"Some people have felt that there
has often been a lack of
communication between Palo Alto and
the University," Doty said. "The
Liaison Committee is a mechanism
through which both parties can join in
a cooperative venture."
The purpose of the committee is to
anticipate and discuss problems of
mutual concern, Doty explained.
When asked why most of the
meetings of the Committee are
conducted privately, Doty explained
that this helps facilitate a relaxed
discussion.

Doty emphasized that Stanford is

concerned about the problem in
College Terrace. The heavy volume of
cars with the concomitant noise,
pollution and danger to children is
indeed a problem that the University is
anxious to try to remedy, he said.
Doty expressed disapproval for a
plan suggested by the College Terrace
Resident's Association that would
block off Stanford Avenue to through
traffic.
"Motorists should be allowed to
vote with their steering wheels," Doty
declared. "To arbitrarily set up
barriers, there, would not be
equitable."
Doty added that the proposed
Frenchman's Terrace housing project
would not adversely affect residents of
College Terrace.
'Minimal Impact'
"Its impact would be minimal,"
Doty said. "The existing streets could
handle the additional traffic well."
Frenchman's Terrace will not
damage the character of the region
either, Doty noted. "It is a first rate
project, not a ghetto. It is looked upon
as an innovative approach to the
construction of low to moderate
income housing," he said. "It fits in
with the city's goals."

Doty stressed that the University is
well aware of Palo Alto's fears about
Stanford growth.
Revenue Source
"The city benefits from Stanford,
but it is impacted also," Doty noted.
"Although the existence of Stanford
means a source of revenue for the city,
it also means a gain in traffic.
"Palo Alto residents have looked
around and seen what has happened all
over the state where open land has
been sacrificed for income."
This realization by the University
of the city's anxieties led to the
formation of the Stanford-Palo Alto
Liaison Committee last year.
"Some people have felt that there
has often been a lack of
communication between Palo Alto and
the University," Doty said. "The
Liaison Committee is a mechanism
through which both parties can join in
a cooperative venture."
The purpose of the committee is to
anticipate and discuss problems of
mutual concern, Doty explained.
When asked why most of the
meetings of the Committee are
conducted privately, Doty explained
that this helps facilitate a relaxed
discussion.

COOPERATION PRAISED — Andrew Doty, director of Community Relations,
discussed issues of mutual concern to Palo Alto and Stanford on KZSU's
Campus Conference yesterday. Doty praised the Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committee for its work in solving problems that have arisen between the
University and the city.
Most residents of College Terrace
seem to be willing to try the plan for
traffic reduction endorsed last week
by the Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committee, according to Andrew
Doty, director of Community
Relations in the Department of
University Relations.
"There is a fair acceptance of this
interim plan," Doty declared on
KZSU's weekly Campus Conference
program. "All parties say that this is a
good way to begin to seek a solution."
Doty referred to the Henderson Plan,
co-recommended to the Palo Alto City
Council by the Liaison Committee at a
meeting last Thursday.
Proposed by Councilman Alan
Henderson, the plan, revised slightly
by the Committee, would block off
some streets and set up more stop
signs in College Terrace in an effort to
slow traffic in the area.
'There is a diversity of opinion
regarding the barriers set up by Palo
Alto in September," Doty said. "They
have encouraged people to speak out.
Many believe the existing barriers
should be removed. They aren't very
popular."
Doty emphasized that Stanford is

College Terrace. The heavy volume of
