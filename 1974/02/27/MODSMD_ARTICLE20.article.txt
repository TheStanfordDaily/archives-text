# Chic Streetman Plays Rhythmic Blues Guitar
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Chic Streetman, a 27-year-old
country blues guitarist, played to
an audience of about 35 people
Tuesday night, Feb. 19, in
Burbank House, as part of
"History of the Blues," an
Undergraduate Special.
Before playing, Streetman gave
credit to some of his bigger
musical influences; Muddy Waters,
Lightnin' Hopkins, John Lee
Hooker, and Brownie McGhee,
among others.
Although he is not currently
performing professionally,
Streetman is considering hitting
some clubs, "if I could get an
audience that's receptive, like this
one."
Originally from Boston,
Streetman now lies in Hayward
where he is the director of a fair
housing project.
Starting out with one of his
own compositions, "Rag Man," he
soon established a friendly, casual
rapport with the small group, who
before long were singing along on
several tunes.
Next was one of Streetman's
more moving original numbers,
"Ode To Maphine," a song about
his grandmother who was born as
the result of his great-grand
mother being raped by a white

man.
Streetman often employed a
very unique, rhythmic bass line, in
his finger-picking acoustic guitar
style.
Included in his repertoire were
four Sunny Terry-Brownie
McGhee tunes, "Living With The
Blues," C'mon If You're Comin',"
"Burnt Child Afraid Of Fire," and
"Sportin' Life."
Also included were songs by
bluesmen such as -John Lee
Hooker, Big Bill Broonzy, and
Leadbelly. Most of Streetman's
unusual guitar style lies
somewhere between McGhee,
Hooker, and Broonzy, but he
occasionally switched to the
smooth, rolling Mississippi John
Hurt style, as on "Shortnin'
Bread." '
Streetman's version of
Leadbelly's "Goodnight Irene"
was once recorded as a single with
vocal backing by the Blossoms.
Unfortunatly, it never made it to
wax.
He also recorded an album in
Paris, Chic Streetman . . . Growing
Up, which should be released in
this country shortly.
Another of his own
compositions, "Hypocritical
Woman," he hopes to have
recorded by Gladys Knight and
the Pips; "I can hear them doing
it."
He occasionally played
harmonica on a neck harness, like
on the traditional "Pick A Bale Of
Cotton."
The music of Ray Charles was
recalled with "Let's Go Get
Stoned," "Hit The Road, Jack,"
and a medley of "Busted" and Taj
Mahal's "Annie's Lover."
Streetman ended his fine set,
after almost 90 minutes, with a
rousing version of the blues
standard "Key To The Highway."
Hopefully, he will soon be
appearing in some Bay Area clubs,
and get the kind of exposure his
talents deserve.
