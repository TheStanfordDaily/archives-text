SAN JOSE - Stanford's
baseball team pulled a reversal in
more ways than one yesterday by
edging San Jose State 3-2 in
Municipal Stadium.
Stanford's performance,
fortunately, was atypical of what
the Cards have accomplished so
far in a 3-8 season.
Dave Frost's fine pitching in
miserable conditions, a stellar
defense and a scrappy offense
were the highlights.
Frost went the distance to even
his record at 1-1. Although he
only had three strikeouts, he
walked but two, a surprise
considering the offerings of the
Stanford pitchers this year.
In five of Stanford's losses this
year, the Cards have been leading
through the fifth inning.
Yesterday, however, the Cards
were trailing 2-1 after the fifth
because Dan Mays of San Jose had
belted a two-run double to
overcome Stanford's single run
scored in the second inning.
Stanford tied the game in the
eighth when Joe Lamoure,
pinchrunning for John Burtchaell,
who had singled to lead off the
inning, scored on a fly ball to
right field by Bob Hampton.
Stanford's winning run was a
result of a sacrifice fly by Kim
Hannaford in the ninth, driving in
Steve Davis. Davis had reached
first on a single to deep shortstop,
was awarded second on a balk and
had advanced to third on an
errant pickoff throw by SJS
catcher Fred DiPietro.
Stanford travels to Buck Shaw
Stadium Friday to play Santa
Clara University in a 2:30 p.m.
game.
