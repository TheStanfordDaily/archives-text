# Pacific Coast Championships
## Skiers Eighth In Final Meet 
### 
In a meet marred by a
blizzard that covered Squaw
Valley with three feet of snow,
Stanford finished a disappointing
eighth last weekend in the Pacific
Coast Ski Championships.
Nevada-Reno, which was
dominant in the Nordic events
(cross country and jumping), won
the championship with 108
points. Sierra College finished
second with 88 points, and both
teams earned invitations to the
NCAA championships next
weekend at Jackson Hole, Wyo.
Sierra dominated the Alpine
events (giant slalom and slalom),
as injuries and falls caused the

heavily favored Nevada team to
fall temporarily behind.
The Pacific Coast
Championships marked the end of
a bittersweet season for the
Stanford team. In January races,
the team finished second and
third, challenging Nevada and
Sierra for pre-eminence in the
nine-team conference. Coaches
Skip Stritter, Mike Iker and Bill
Gibson felt then that the team
was strong enough to promise a
first or second place finish in the
Pacific Coast meet and earn an
invitation to the NCAA's.
Injuries to key skiers —
including David Horth, a
conference favorite — caused
Stanford to fall far short of that
goal.
There were several outstanding
individual performances, however,
Tom Hutton's strong sixth place
finish in the giant slalom may
have earned him an individual
invitation to the NCAA's. Steve
Lindbeck placed third in cross
country, Diane Gates and Kathy
Frankland sixth and seventh in
the women's slalom, Phil Barnes
11th In the slalom and Gary
Wright 16th in the giant slalom.
Stanford jumpers Dave
Andrews and Mark Colville had
several of the longest jumps of the
day (clearing 90 feet), but were

hampered by their inexperience in
form and finished 16th and 17th
respectively.
Stanford hosted the event,
which ran smoothly except that
the scheduled downhill race was
replaced by a giant slalom because
of the blizzard.
Coaches Stritter, Iker and
Gibson were disappointed by the
eighth place finish, but noted that
the team is predominantly
composed of freshmen and
sophomores and should have an
outstanding season in 1974-75.

invitation to the NCAA's. Steve
Lindbeck placed third in cross
country, Diane Gates and Kathy
Frankland sixth and seventh in
the women's slalom, Phil Barnes
11th In the slalom and Gary
Wright 16th in the giant slalom.
Stanford jumpers Dave
Andrews and Mark Colville had
several of the longest jumps of the
day (clearing 90 feet), but were

hampered by their inexperience in
form and finished 16th and 17th
respectively.
Stanford hosted the event,
which ran smoothly except that
the scheduled downhill race was
replaced by a giant slalom because
of the blizzard.
Coaches Stritter, Iker and
Gibson were disappointed by the
eighth place finish, but noted that
the team is predominantly
composed of freshmen and
sophomores and should have an
outstanding season in 1974-75.
