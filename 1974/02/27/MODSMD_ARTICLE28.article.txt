## Dark Days For Finley's A's 
### Don Tollefson 
Charlie Finley, that master of showmanship,
buffoonery and irrationality, almost outdid himself
last week. As if anticipating a series of "Exorcism
Nights" at the Coliseum this season, Finley, who
personifies the devil for many of his players and
ex-managers, went out and re-hired an ex-manager
who seems obsessed with evangelistic fervor.
With a performance that could inspire another
Billy Graham movie, Alvin Dark responded to his
re-hiring by reporting that for "the past few years
I've tried to think how Jesus Christ would handle
ball players." At least Dark will add a new
dimension to the laborious rite of spring training.
For those sports journalists who find press
conferences usually soporific at best, last week's
conference announcing Dark's hiring was a rare
gem. Noticeably missing was the sugar-coated pap
about how the new manager is the greatest thing
that's happened to baseball since the electric
scoreboard.
Finley made it clear that he will give Dark every
chance to equal Hank Bauer's record of having been
fired twice by the same owner. "Yes, I have hired
him again; yes, he can expect some day to be fired
again." Never accuse Finley of diplomacy.
Inevitable Conflicts
Yet Finley, whose "I am the owner!" type
statements have rivaled the President's for their
arrogance, may have found in Dark an aide even the
White House would be proud of. Dark approaches
the issue of those inevitable conflicts every manager
of Finley's has faced by quoting Hebrews 13;
"Obey them who rule over you and submit to
them."
Many of the A's are still extremely bitter
toward Finley because he created an atmosphere
which forced a manager they respected greatly to
leave the club. I am sure that Dark's articulation of
a submissive attitude toward Finley was not the
best way to start a cordial relationship with his
players.
No one has forgotten the Mike Andrews incident
which deeply marred last year's World Series. Yet
at another point in the press conference, Dark
stuck his other foot in his mouth when he
explained how he felt about Finley getting
involved in specific personnel questions. "If finally
the general manager [Finley] tells me to use
[Catcher Ray] Fosse at shortstop, Fosse will play
shortstop."
The brilliance of these comments is even more
remarkable given the fact that Dark has been
seriously tainted since 1964 for some remarks he
reportedly made to a sports writer.
Racial Slurs
At that time, Stan Isaacs of Newsday reported
that Dark, who was managing the San Francisco
Giants, had told him; "We have trouble because we
have so many Negro and Spanish-speaking players
on this team. They are just not able to perform up
to the white ballplayers when it comes to mental
alertness. You can't make most Negro and
Spanish-speaking players have the pride in their
team that you get from white players."
As recently as last week, Dark again called that

Newsday article "untrue and unfair." "Let me say,
because of that article written by Stan Isaacs,
which was taken out of context, you will never get
the air cleared. Each individual player will have to
determine for himself how I treat him. My actions
speak louder than any words I can use. At the end
of this season, each guy on this team can say I
treated him fairly."
Hopefully the A's players will give Dark a
chance, but I doubt he will have an easy time
overcoming this long standing stigma or his more
recent remarks. Despite these obstacles, Dark still
expresses a strong self-confidence.
'Redeeming My Life'
"I don't think I did a good job in Cleveland and
I know I made mistakes in Kansas City. But I have
myself straightened out now and I'm seven years
older and confident I can do what I spent my
whole life working at: thinking baseball.
I am redeeming my life from what I have learned
from the Bible the last 2V?. years ... I may tell them
[the players] to do something, but I'm not going to
pound my fist and cuss them. It's all a feeling of
love just like it tells you here in Corinthians."
If Dark can gain the respect of his players
without incurring the wrath of Finley, I am
confident the A's will find themselves in a third
consecutive World Series. But that will require
some skillful tightrope walking.
It's too bad that Finley, who for all his
shortcomings has brought some much-needed
innovation to the game, didn't have sufficient guts
to hire a black manager.
Instead Finley opted for one of his countless
ex-managers. What is so amazing is that even if
Dark turns out to be a total lackey of Finley's who
gains no respect from his players, the A's still could
conceivably win the World Championship. The
strange world of the Oakland A's is now just a little
bit stranger.
