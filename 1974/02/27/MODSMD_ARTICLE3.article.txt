# Monopoly Masters Set World Record
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
SAN FRANCISCO — the contest had its up and downs, but Stanford's
six marathon-Monopoly players triumphed over nausea, raging
conventioneers and general weariness Monday afternoon to beat U.C.
Berkeley and establish a new world's record of 108 continuous hours spent
playing Monopoly in a moving elevator.
The original agreement with the Hyatt Regency Hotel, where the
marathon took place, and Parker Brothers, makers of Monopoly, called for
Cal and Stanford to compete against each other but to cooperate in
sustaining play for at least 100 hours. The Rochester Institute of
Technology in New York was their designated rival in the overall
endurance contest.

Committee checked up on Rochester, competing out of a dorm elevator,
to make sure there were no illegal lapses in play or early quitting. Stanford
and Cal were kept scrupulously honest by local news and coverage and
thousands of hotel guests watching them buying and banking between
floors in one of the hotel's glass capsule elevators.
'Elevator Legs'
The West Coast teams called Rochester when they broke the University
of Bridgeport's previously earned 60 hour record. The Stanford group had
found its "elevator legs." Most players were off Dramamine and fast on
the way to becoming railroad barons in the great tradition of the
University's founder. (Harvard and Kansas Universities are also previous
title holders with 57 hours 34 minutes and 50 hour records, respectively.)
Players at the Regency made a second call to Rochester after 75 hours.
They hoped to demoralize their dorm-bound competition by describing

their glamourous surroundings. But they did not mention the spectators
who had become a bit much: One Stanford team member described hotel
personnel and players' attempts to deal with tipsy guests as something akin
to "handling a lot of kindergartners with automatic rifles."
The third call East informed Stanford and Cal players that Rochester
had indeed folded up the board and put its money away after 100 hours.
Jubilant, Punchy
The jubiliant and somewhat punchy Stanford team, captained by Mark
Brown, a 1973 graduate in electrical engineering, decided to try to out-last
Berkeley as well as Rochester. And while their motives were of the most
sportsmanlike nature, some of their fans were less fair-minded. One
well-dressed matron had rather seriously exhorted the team not to permit
Cal to buy Boardwalk and referred to the U.C. players as "peons."
As the post-100 hour play began, only four Stanford players remained
at the hotel. Seniors Carol Crosby and Gary DeSmet, sophomore Irma
Nogales and Brown faced the last two weary Cal competitors. Sophomores
Alice Clark and Mike Best had finished their shifts and returned to Palo
Alto, where they remained on alert in the event of a Cal comeback. But
too many Berkeley players had already returned to school and could not
be coaxed back across the Bay.
When Cal picked up its markers (including an Impeach Nixon button)
at 107 hours, four members of the Stanford team sat down for a final
hour of comraderie, establishing a new single team endurance record. In
addition to holding the intercollegiate title with Berkeley at 107 hours,
Stanford students demonstrated a marked superiority as fledgling
capitalists, winning 25 of the 43 games played.
Because their elevator remained in regular service for most of the
marathon, students were frequently in the company of guests and tourists.
Many were understandably surprised to find a card table and players
passing GO, buying Marvin Gardens and drawing Community Chest cards
as they hurtled up and down an estimate total of 17,000 floors. The
observers' most frequent questions were: "Is this an elevator?" "Does
the hotel know you are here?" "What happens when you want to go to the
bathroom?" and "Do you want a drink?"
