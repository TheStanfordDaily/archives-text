# Monopoly Masters Set World Record

SAN FRANCISCO — the contest had its up and downs, but Stanford's
six marathon-Monopoly players triumphed over nausea, raging
conventioneers and general weariness Monday afternoon to beat U.C.
Berkeley and establish a new world's record of 108 continuous hours spent
playing Monopoly in a moving elevator.
The original agreement with the Hyatt Regency Hotel, where the
marathon took place, and Parker Brothers, makers of Monopoly, called for
Cal and Stanford to compete against each other but to cooperate in
sustaining play for at least 100 hours. The Rochester Institute of
Technology in New York was their designated rival in the overall
endurance contest.

Committee checked up on Rochester, competing out of a dorm elevator,
to make sure there were no illegal lapses in play or early quitting. Stanford
and Cal were kept scrupulously honest by local news and coverage and
thousands of hotel guests watching them buying and banking between
floors in one of the hotel's glass capsule elevators.
'Elevator Legs'
The West Coast teams called Rochester when they broke the University
of Bridgeport's previously earned 60 hour record. The Stanford group had
found its "elevator legs." Most players were off Dramamine and fast on
the way to becoming railroad barons in the great tradition of the
University's founder. (Harvard and Kansas Universities are also previous
title holders with 57 hours 34 minutes and 50 hour records, respectively.)
Players at the Regency made a second call to Rochester after 75 hours.
They hoped to demoralize their dorm-bound competition by describing
