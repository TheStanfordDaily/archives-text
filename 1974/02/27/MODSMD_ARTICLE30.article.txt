Kissinger Arrives In Syria
DAMASCUS, Syria — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger arrived here last night hopeful of getting a list of
Israeli war prisoners and generating movement toward
Syrian-Israeli troop disengagement.
"I hope that in Damascus we can begin progress toward
getting peace started and the disengagement of troops
between Syria and Israel," Kissinger said in London before
boarding his United States Air Force jet for the Middle
East.
"The issue of prisoners is, of course, one of the
preconditions of getting peace talks started," he said.
Syria's foreign minister, Abdul Halim Khaddam,
welcomed Kissinger at the airport and they headed for
President Hafez Assad's palace for their first working
session.
Few details emerged from Kissinger's talks with Prime
Minister Edward Heath and other British officials. However,
the secretary of state indicated he had some advance notice
that Syria might be ready to meet Israel's demand for a list
of about 100 Israeli prisoners held in Syria. The demand is
a precondition to Israeli participation in troop withdrawal
talks on the Golan Heights — the objective of Kissinger's
current Middle East peace mission.
A senior U.S. official in the Kissinger delegation said
Kissinger probably would couple his visit to Moscow in the
second half of March with another swing through the
Middle East. His objective then would be arranging a
further Israeli withdrawal on the Sinai peninsula, perhaps
the last before a final peace settlement is negotiated in
Geneva.
Reagan Blasts Food Recipients
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday
that persons who accept the free food distributed in answer
to demands from the kidnapers of Patricia Hearst are
"aiding and abetting lawlessness."
Reagan commented on the sixth tension-filled day since
the last communique from the Syinbionese Liberation
Army — the longest silence from them since the abduction
Feb. 4.
Reagan also said he would refuse to order two alleged
SLA members released from San Quentin Prison where they
are awaiting trial for murder — even if the terrorists

demanded it as a condition of Patricia's safe return. He said
there was no legal way for him to comply with such a
demand.
The young woman's father, Randolph A. Hearst,
continued his vigil at the family mansion, hoping for word
from the group.
Meanwhile, the People In Need food program set up by
Hearst prepared to resume food distribution, possibly by
tomorrow. The SLA has demanded a total $6 million
program of high-quality food for the poor.
Subpoena Hit By Nixon Lawyers
WASHINGTON — Lawyers for President Nixon said
yesterday that no state court can command the president of
the United States to appear before its bench.
Such a move "would open the door to an unwarranted,
unfettered, and an unconstitutional imposition" upon his
office, the lawyers said.
The White House position was outlined in a brief filed in
D.C. Superior Court. The court is considering whether the
President must testify in a case now pending in Los Angeles
against former White House adviser John D. Ehrlichman.
Nixon was subpoenaed last month by California
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer as "a material and
necessary witness." The subpoena was forwarded to the
District of Columbia court for service.
"In the 187 years since our Constitution was adopted no
court, federal or state, has held that the president of the
United States can be compelled tc testify in person in
compliance with a summons," said the White House brief
filed by presidential lawyer James D. St. Clair.
"The office of the president of the United States cannot
be subjected to the command of any state court,"he said.
Hayakawa Argues Ineligibility
FRESNO — Dr. S.I. Hayakawa denounced yesterday a
California Supreme Court ruling that said he could not be a
candidate for the U.S. Senate in the June primary because
he switched political parties last year.
"I'm deprived of my constitutional rights," Hayakawa
excitedly told newsmen last night at the Fresno Republican
Assembly. "I'm totally disenfranchised. I've been a
law-abiding citizen of this state 19 years and I think I'm
getting a raw deal."
The state high court's 4-3 ruling denied a petition which
asked the court to invalidate the State Election Code
requirements that a partisan candidate must have registered
with one political party at least a year before filing.
Hayawaka had been a registered Democrat from 1955
until he switched to the Republican Party last Aug. 31.
Because of this he would not have been a registered
Republican for one year either before the March 8 deadline
for declaring his candidacy or before the June 4 primary
election.
Hayakawa is the former president of San Francisco State
University and a noted semanticist.
Today's Weather
Showers likely ending by this morning then partly
cloudy through tonight. Mostly cloudy tomorrow with a
chance of rain. Continued mild temperatures. Lows tonight
in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the
upper 50s to low 60s. Southerly wind shifting to westerly
today.

Nixon was subpoenaed last month by California
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer as "a material and
necessary witness." The subpoena was forwarded to the
District of Columbia court for service.
"In the 187 years since our Constitution was adopted no
court, federal or state, has held that the president of the
United States can be compelled tc testify in person in
compliance with a summons," said the White House brief
filed by presidential lawyer James D. St. Clair.
"The office of the president of the United States cannot
be subjected to the command of any state court,"he said.
Hayakawa Argues Ineligibility
FRESNO — Dr. S.I. Hayakawa denounced yesterday a
California Supreme Court ruling that said he could not be a
candidate for the U.S. Senate in the June primary because
he switched political parties last year.
"I'm deprived of my constitutional rights," Hayakawa
excitedly told newsmen last night at the Fresno Republican
Assembly. "I'm totally disenfranchised. I've been a
law-abiding citizen of this state 19 years and I think I'm
getting a raw deal."
The state high court's 4-3 ruling denied a petition which
asked the court to invalidate the State Election Code
requirements that a partisan candidate must have registered
with one political party at least a year before filing.
Hayawaka had been a registered Democrat from 1955
until he switched to the Republican Party last Aug. 31.
Because of this he would not have been a registered
Republican for one year either before the March 8 deadline
for declaring his candidacy or before the June 4 primary
election.
Hayakawa is the former president of San Francisco State
University and a noted semanticist.
Today's Weather
Showers likely ending by this morning then partly
cloudy through tonight. Mostly cloudy tomorrow with a
chance of rain. Continued mild temperatures. Lows tonight
in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the
upper 50s to low 60s. Southerly wind shifting to westerly
today.
Kissinger Arrives In Syria
DAMASCUS, Syria — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger arrived here last night hopeful of getting a list of
Israeli war prisoners and generating movement toward
Syrian-Israeli troop disengagement.
"I hope that in Damascus we can begin progress toward
getting peace started and the disengagement of troops
between Syria and Israel," Kissinger said in London before
boarding his United States Air Force jet for the Middle
East.
"The issue of prisoners is, of course, one of the
preconditions of getting peace talks started," he said.
Syria's foreign minister, Abdul Halim Khaddam,
welcomed Kissinger at the airport and they headed for
President Hafez Assad's palace for their first working
session.
Few details emerged from Kissinger's talks with Prime
Minister Edward Heath and other British officials. However,
the secretary of state indicated he had some advance notice
that Syria might be ready to meet Israel's demand for a list
of about 100 Israeli prisoners held in Syria. The demand is
a precondition to Israeli participation in troop withdrawal
talks on the Golan Heights — the objective of Kissinger's
current Middle East peace mission.
A senior U.S. official in the Kissinger delegation said
Kissinger probably would couple his visit to Moscow in the
second half of March with another swing through the
Middle East. His objective then would be arranging a
further Israeli withdrawal on the Sinai peninsula, perhaps
the last before a final peace settlement is negotiated in
Geneva.
Reagan Blasts Food Recipients
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday
that persons who accept the free food distributed in answer
to demands from the kidnapers of Patricia Hearst are
"aiding and abetting lawlessness."
Reagan commented on the sixth tension-filled day since
the last communique from the Syinbionese Liberation
Army — the longest silence from them since the abduction
Feb. 4.
Reagan also said he would refuse to order two alleged
SLA members released from San Quentin Prison where they
are awaiting trial for murder — even if the terrorists

demanded it as a condition of Patricia's safe return. He said
there was no legal way for him to comply with such a
demand.
The young woman's father, Randolph A. Hearst,
continued his vigil at the family mansion, hoping for word
from the group.
Meanwhile, the People In Need food program set up by
Hearst prepared to resume food distribution, possibly by
tomorrow. The SLA has demanded a total $6 million
program of high-quality food for the poor.
Subpoena Hit By Nixon Lawyers
WASHINGTON — Lawyers for President Nixon said

that Syria might be ready to meet Israel's demand for a list
of about 100 Israeli prisoners held in Syria. The demand is
a precondition to Israeli participation in troop withdrawal
talks on the Golan Heights — the objective of Kissinger's
current Middle East peace mission.
A senior U.S. official in the Kissinger delegation said
Kissinger probably would couple his visit to Moscow in the
second half of March with another swing through the
Middle East. His objective then would be arranging a
further Israeli withdrawal on the Sinai peninsula, perhaps
the last before a final peace settlement is negotiated in
Geneva.
Reagan Blasts Food Recipients
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday
that persons who accept the free food distributed in answer
to demands from the kidnapers of Patricia Hearst are
"aiding and abetting lawlessness."
Reagan commented on the sixth tension-filled day since
the last communique from the Syinbionese Liberation
Army — the longest silence from them since the abduction
Feb. 4.
Reagan also said he would refuse to order two alleged
SLA members released from San Quentin Prison where they
are awaiting trial for murder — even if the terrorists

demanded it as a condition of Patricia's safe return. He said
there was no legal way for him to comply with such a
demand.
The young woman's father, Randolph A. Hearst,
continued his vigil at the family mansion, hoping for word
from the group.
Meanwhile, the People In Need food program set up by
Hearst prepared to resume food distribution, possibly by
tomorrow. The SLA has demanded a total $6 million
program of high-quality food for the poor.
Subpoena Hit By Nixon Lawyers
WASHINGTON — Lawyers for President Nixon said
yesterday that no state court can command the president of
the United States to appear before its bench.
Such a move "would open the door to an unwarranted,
unfettered, and an unconstitutional imposition" upon his
office, the lawyers said.
The White House position was outlined in a brief filed in
D.C. Superior Court. The court is considering whether the
President must testify in a case now pending in Los Angeles
against former White House adviser John D. Ehrlichman.
Nixon was subpoenaed last month by California
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer as "a material and
necessary witness." The subpoena was forwarded to the
District of Columbia court for service.
"In the 187 years since our Constitution was adopted no
court, federal or state, has held that the president of the
United States can be compelled tc testify in person in
compliance with a summons," said the White House brief
filed by presidential lawyer James D. St. Clair.
"The office of the president of the United States cannot
be subjected to the command of any state court,"he said.
Hayakawa Argues Ineligibility
FRESNO — Dr. S.I. Hayakawa denounced yesterday a
California Supreme Court ruling that said he could not be a
candidate for the U.S. Senate in the June primary because
he switched political parties last year.
"I'm deprived of my constitutional rights," Hayakawa
excitedly told newsmen last night at the Fresno Republican
Assembly. "I'm totally disenfranchised. I've been a
law-abiding citizen of this state 19 years and I think I'm
getting a raw deal."
The state high court's 4-3 ruling denied a petition which
asked the court to invalidate the State Election Code
requirements that a partisan candidate must have registered
with one political party at least a year before filing.
Hayawaka had been a registered Democrat from 1955
until he switched to the Republican Party last Aug. 31.
Because of this he would not have been a registered
Republican for one year either before the March 8 deadline
for declaring his candidacy or before the June 4 primary
election.
Hayakawa is the former president of San Francisco State
University and a noted semanticist.
Today's Weather
Showers likely ending by this morning then partly
cloudy through tonight. Mostly cloudy tomorrow with a
chance of rain. Continued mild temperatures. Lows tonight
in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the
upper 50s to low 60s. Southerly wind shifting to westerly
today.
Kissinger Arrives In Syria
DAMASCUS, Syria — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger arrived here last night hopeful of getting a list of
Israeli war prisoners and generating movement toward
Syrian-Israeli troop disengagement.
"I hope that in Damascus we can begin progress toward
getting peace started and the disengagement of troops
between Syria and Israel," Kissinger said in London before
boarding his United States Air Force jet for the Middle
East.
"The issue of prisoners is, of course, one of the
preconditions of getting peace talks started," he said.
Syria's foreign minister, Abdul Halim Khaddam,
welcomed Kissinger at the airport and they headed for
President Hafez Assad's palace for their first working
session.
Few details emerged from Kissinger's talks with Prime
Minister Edward Heath and other British officials. However,
the secretary of state indicated he had some advance notice
that Syria might be ready to meet Israel's demand for a list
of about 100 Israeli prisoners held in Syria. The demand is
