# Gasoline Committee Formed
## 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
A select committee of the state
Assembly has been formed to
investigate "unfair practices" of the
major oil companies, Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti announced
yesterday in San Jose.
Moretti made the announcement at
a joint press conference with Jim
Campbell, president of the California
Service Station Association, and Ken
Davis, president of the San Jose
chapter of the National Service Station
Dealers' Association.
The Select Committee on Service
Station Franchising and Petroleum
Product Practices will have the power
of subpoena, Moretti said, and will
begin its investigation within the next
ten days.
The purpose of the committee, to
be chaired by Assemblyman Jack
Fenton, D-Montebello, is to "build the
documentation we need for what we
feel very strongly exists," Moretti said.
'Real Bombshell'
Ken Davis, who operates a Shell
station in San Jose, said that he was
informed prior to the news conference

that all California Shell stations next
month would receive 60 percent of
last year's March allotment of gasoline.
Davis added that this "real bombshell"
will restrict his business to only two
hours daily.
"We can't wait for Reagan to
decide we don't have an energy
problem," Davis continued. "We need
an allocation program, and that
program is going to have to be
mandatory." Davis added that Santa
Clara County's voluntary "odd-even"
program has not succeeded, partly
because only half of the county's
dealers have participated.
Part of the problem would be
alleviated, Davis said, if dealers were
allowed to buy gas on the open
market. Presently, the dealers are
required by their leases to buy their
fuel from the major oil companies that
franchise them, he said.
Black Market Gas
Jim Campbell said there is a lot of
gasoline available on the black market.

"We were offered three million gallons
in the last two months," he stated.
Campbell added that the independent
oil jobbers who made the offer
somehow have obtained large
quantities of fuel.
Moretti said that no one knows
how they did this, how much they
have, or where they are storing it. The
fuel was probably obtained illegally
from the major oil companies.
Moretti urged California citizens to
pressure Gov. Ronald Reagan to
accept a position as the state's energy
czar. "So far he's acted like we don't
have an energy problem here," Moretti
said.
Campbell added, nonetheless, that
the dealers' associations are not now
considering a strike. The dealers, he
said, are waiting to see the results of
legislative action such as the select
committee's investigation. The recent
two-cents-per-gallon price rise also led
the dealers to postpone their strike, he
said.

in the last two months," he stated.
Campbell added that the independent
oil jobbers who made the offer
somehow have obtained large
quantities of fuel.
Moretti said that no one knows
how they did this, how much they
have, or where they are storing it. The
fuel was probably obtained illegally
from the major oil companies.
Moretti urged California citizens to
pressure Gov. Ronald Reagan to
accept a position as the state's energy
czar. "So far he's acted like we don't
have an energy problem here," Moretti
said.
Campbell added, nonetheless, that
the dealers' associations are not now
considering a strike. The dealers, he
said, are waiting to see the results of
legislative action such as the select
committee's investigation. The recent
two-cents-per-gallon price rise also led
the dealers to postpone their strike, he
said.
A select committee of the state
Assembly has been formed to
investigate "unfair practices" of the
major oil companies, Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti announced
yesterday in San Jose.
Moretti made the announcement at
a joint press conference with Jim
Campbell, president of the California
Service Station Association, and Ken
Davis, president of the San Jose
chapter of the National Service Station
Dealers' Association.
The Select Committee on Service
Station Franchising and Petroleum
Product Practices will have the power
of subpoena, Moretti said, and will
begin its investigation within the next
ten days.
The purpose of the committee, to
be chaired by Assemblyman Jack
Fenton, D-Montebello, is to "build the
documentation we need for what we
feel very strongly exists," Moretti said.
'Real Bombshell'
Ken Davis, who operates a Shell
station in San Jose, said that he was
informed prior to the news conference

that all California Shell stations next
month would receive 60 percent of
last year's March allotment of gasoline.
Davis added that this "real bombshell"
will restrict his business to only two
hours daily.
"We can't wait for Reagan to
decide we don't have an energy
problem," Davis continued. "We need
an allocation program, and that
program is going to have to be
mandatory." Davis added that Santa
Clara County's voluntary "odd-even"
program has not succeeded, partly
because only half of the county's
dealers have participated.
Part of the problem would be
alleviated, Davis said, if dealers were
allowed to buy gas on the open
market. Presently, the dealers are
required by their leases to buy their
fuel from the major oil companies that
franchise them, he said.
Black Market Gas
Jim Campbell said there is a lot of
gasoline available on the black market.

"We were offered three million gallons
in the last two months," he stated.
Campbell added that the independent
oil jobbers who made the offer
somehow have obtained large
quantities of fuel.
Moretti said that no one knows
how they did this, how much they
have, or where they are storing it. The
