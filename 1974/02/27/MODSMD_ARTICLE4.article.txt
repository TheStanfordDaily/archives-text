# HUD May Oppose Housing Priorities
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The area director of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) announced
yesterday that he will probably
demand that the proposed
Frenchman's Terrace housing project
on the Stanford campus be built
without occupancy restrictions.
James Price, area director of HUD,
said that he supports the aim of
Frenchman's Terrace to provide low to
moderate cost housing for residents of
the Palo Alto area. But he is against
allowing members of the Stanford
community to have priority on
occupancy.
Price said that although the
restrictions proposed by Stanford and
the Midpeninsula Urban Coalition are
legal, the area office has the authority
to overrule the proposal.
Restrictions
If constructed, the 225-unit project
would be built on land provided by
Stanford. Although the University
would make certain that the project be
constructed in a responsible manner,
housing on Frenchman's Terrace
would be sponsored, developed
maintained by the Urban Coalition.
By the provisions of the
restrictions, 50 percent of the
occupants would be Stanford
employees, 25 percent would be
employees of firms located on
Stanford land, and 25 percent would
be people who work in the area but
are unrelated to the University.
Price contended that the
restrictions would make the project
discriminatory toward people
unconnected with the University.
Alan Maremont, executive director
of the Midpeninsula Housing
Corporation of the Urban Coalition,
pointed out that the removal of the
restrictions would endanger the future
of the Frenchman's Terrace plan.
Not Discriminatory
Maremont explained that the
University probably would be hesitant
to build the project if it couldn't give
priority to its employees.
Maremont added that the project is
not discriminatory towards the general

Palo Alto community.
"People affiliated with Stanford are
the logical people to reside in
Frenchman's Terrace," Maremont said.
Appeal
If the area office of HUD insists
upon its plan, the Urban Coalition will
appeal the matter to the regional
office, Maremont said. "But at the
present time, our efforts are
concentrated on the area office," he
stated. "We are still hopeful that they
will approve it."
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
agreed with Maremont that the
occupancy restrictions are not
tantamount to discriminatory quotas.
"Stanford has insisted that if it is to
commit land there must be priorities
attached to the occupancy
restrictions," Augsburger hoted. "We
are under no obligation to give up the
land."
The twenty acres of Frenchman's
Terrace would be annexed to Palo
Alto, in order that the city could
provide municipal services for the
pioject. Although Stanford provides
its own municipal services, University
officials contend that there is no
reason for Stanford to be forced to
carry the burden of the Frenchman's
Terrace pioject city services.
Priorities
The purpose of the restrictions on
occupancy is to give employees of
Stanford an opportunity to live near
their place of work. The imposition of
a ban on restrictions would defeat one
of the main reasons for having the
project, Augsburger explained.
Special priorities would be given to
people who have been displaced by the
construction of public projects, he
noted.
The Frenchman's Terrace housing
project was originally proposed in
1968, after two committees identified
the housing needs of Stanford
employees and studied means for a
Stanford response. In June 1970, the
Board of Trustees approved the
project, and the University began
specific plans.

the Midpeninsula Urban Coalition are
legal, the area office has the authority
to overrule the proposal.
Restrictions
If constructed, the 225-unit project
would be built on land provided by
Stanford. Although the University
would make certain that the project be
constructed in a responsible manner,
housing on Frenchman's Terrace
would be sponsored, developed
maintained by the Urban Coalition.
By the provisions of the
restrictions, 50 percent of the
occupants would be Stanford
employees, 25 percent would be
employees of firms located on
Stanford land, and 25 percent would
be people who work in the area but
are unrelated to the University.
Price contended that the
restrictions would make the project
discriminatory toward people
unconnected with the University.
Alan Maremont, executive director
of the Midpeninsula Housing
Corporation of the Urban Coalition,
pointed out that the removal of the
restrictions would endanger the future
of the Frenchman's Terrace plan.
Not Discriminatory
Maremont explained that the
University probably would be hesitant
to build the project if it couldn't give
priority to its employees.
Maremont added that the project is
not discriminatory towards the general

Palo Alto community.
"People affiliated with Stanford are
the logical people to reside in
Frenchman's Terrace," Maremont said.
Appeal
If the area office of HUD insists
upon its plan, the Urban Coalition will
appeal the matter to the regional
office, Maremont said. "But at the
present time, our efforts are
concentrated on the area office," he
stated. "We are still hopeful that they
will approve it."
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
agreed with Maremont that the
occupancy restrictions are not
tantamount to discriminatory quotas.
"Stanford has insisted that if it is to
commit land there must be priorities
attached to the occupancy
restrictions," Augsburger hoted. "We
are under no obligation to give up the
land."
The twenty acres of Frenchman's
Terrace would be annexed to Palo
Alto, in order that the city could
provide municipal services for the
pioject. Although Stanford provides
its own municipal services, University
officials contend that there is no
reason for Stanford to be forced to
carry the burden of the Frenchman's
Terrace pioject city services.
Priorities
The purpose of the restrictions on
occupancy is to give employees of
Stanford an opportunity to live near
their place of work. The imposition of
a ban on restrictions would defeat one
of the main reasons for having the
project, Augsburger explained.
Special priorities would be given to
people who have been displaced by the
construction of public projects, he
noted.
The Frenchman's Terrace housing
project was originally proposed in
1968, after two committees identified
the housing needs of Stanford
employees and studied means for a
Stanford response. In June 1970, the
Board of Trustees approved the
project, and the University began
specific plans.
The area director of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) announced
yesterday that he will probably
demand that the proposed
Frenchman's Terrace housing project
on the Stanford campus be built
without occupancy restrictions.
James Price, area director of HUD,
said that he supports the aim of
Frenchman's Terrace to provide low to
moderate cost housing for residents of
the Palo Alto area. But he is against
allowing members of the Stanford
community to have priority on
occupancy.
Price said that although the
restrictions proposed by Stanford and
the Midpeninsula Urban Coalition are
legal, the area office has the authority
to overrule the proposal.
