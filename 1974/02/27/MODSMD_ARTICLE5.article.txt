# Truckers' Discrimination Suit
## Union, Firm Defend Motion 
### DON COX 
Lawyers for the Pacific
Intermountain Express (P.1.E.)
company and Teamsters Union locals
said yesterday they did not regard as
unconstitutional their motion to
restrict Law Prof. William Gould's
communication in connection with the
class action suit Gould has brought
against the Teamsters and major
trucking firms.
P.I.E. lawyers filed the motion Feb.
12 charging Gould had engaged in
unethical "solicitation" of clients.
They cited a letter Gould had sent to
P.I.E. truck drivers as evidence.
Gould maintains he was only trying
to collect information on
discriminatory practices in the
company and the union to be used as
evidence in the trial.
Gould filed the class action suit on
behalf of eight minority truck drivers
and is seeking $50 million in damages
for alleged discriminatory practices.
Recommended Order
Wesley Fastiff, attorney for the
Teamsters Union locals, explained that
the order he sought restricting Gould's
communication was "an order
recommended for cases of this type by
the Manual for Complex Litigation."
Duane Beeson, attorney for P.I.E.
said "the Manual restricts any
communication he (Gould) has for the
purpose of drumming up interests
among potential clients."
Fastiff explained the Manual was a
set of procedures for judges compiled
by judges and distinguished members
of the Bar for cases involving complex
litigation.
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam had
countered that such an order must be
applied consistent with the First
Amendment.
Lawyer's Obligation
Beeson recognized that the order
might be viewed as constitutionally
questionable by some lawyers, but
that it was "the lawyer's right and
obligation to take advantage of all
legal rules" to defend his client.
Said Fastiff, "Our interests are in
doing the best legal job in defending
our clients." If an attorney thinks
anything is going on that would
adversely affect his client, he must
take expeditious action."

Asked what he thought was "going
on" in this case, Fastiff replied that
there "is potential abuse of the class
action suit," but he would not
elaborate.
Amsterdam suggested in his brief
that even if Gould had engaged in
solicitation, he could legally do so
since he was accepting no financial
remuneration.
Beeson said that although Gould
has "the highest moral principles, my
notion of principles that underlie legal
ethics is different. You don't solicit
whether performing for nothing or
not."
No Discrimination
Beeson said, "I know of no instance
of discrimination on the part of the
union and am confident that this will
not be established."
"It is P.l.E.'s position that it has
not engaged in discriminatory conduct
whatsoever," Fastiff said.
"I am worried that this case might
be decided on tha relative numbers of
whites employed, in which case this is
not a case for lawyers," said Beeson.
"It is desirable to work minorities
into the industry," continued Beeson,

who said he thought the Teamsters
were doing this.
Gag Order
In a hearing Feb. 15, U.S. District
Court Judge Robert H. Schnacke
agreed to another hearing on the Feb.
12 motion to be held March 15. He
also slapped a "gag order" on Gould
prohibiting all communications about
the case prior to March 15.
Schnacke imposed the gag order
after the defendants' lawyers
expressed "a great fear" that the
solicitation they charged Gould had
engaged in, would continue until their
motion had been ruled on.
Amsterdam is appealing the
constitutionality of the gag order to
the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court on
Gould's behalf.
"This is an extraordinary case. So
far as we can tell no court has ever
issued a (gag) order of the sort made
by Judge Schnacke," said Amsterdam.
"What happened here would be
unimaginable if it had not happened,"
added Amsterdam.
Fastiff said it would be
"inappropriate at this time" for him to
comment on the gag order.

Lawyers for the Pacific
Intermountain Express (P.1.E.)
company and Teamsters Union locals
said yesterday they did not regard as
unconstitutional their motion to
restrict Law Prof. William Gould's
communication in connection with the
class action suit Gould has brought
against the Teamsters and major
trucking firms.
P.I.E. lawyers filed the motion Feb.
12 charging Gould had engaged in
unethical "solicitation" of clients.
They cited a letter Gould had sent to
P.I.E. truck drivers as evidence.
Gould maintains he was only trying
to collect information on
discriminatory practices in the
company and the union to be used as
evidence in the trial.
Gould filed the class action suit on
behalf of eight minority truck drivers
and is seeking $50 million in damages
for alleged discriminatory practices.
Recommended Order
Wesley Fastiff, attorney for the
Teamsters Union locals, explained that
the order he sought restricting Gould's
communication was "an order
recommended for cases of this type by
the Manual for Complex Litigation."
Duane Beeson, attorney for P.I.E.
said "the Manual restricts any
communication he (Gould) has for the
purpose of drumming up interests
among potential clients."
Fastiff explained the Manual was a
set of procedures for judges compiled
by judges and distinguished members
of the Bar for cases involving complex
litigation.
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam had
countered that such an order must be
applied consistent with the First
Amendment.
Lawyer's Obligation
Beeson recognized that the order
might be viewed as constitutionally
questionable by some lawyers, but
that it was "the lawyer's right and
obligation to take advantage of all
legal rules" to defend his client.
Said Fastiff, "Our interests are in
doing the best legal job in defending
our clients." If an attorney thinks
anything is going on that would
adversely affect his client, he must
take expeditious action."

Asked what he thought was "going
on" in this case, Fastiff replied that
there "is potential abuse of the class
action suit," but he would not
elaborate.
Amsterdam suggested in his brief
that even if Gould had engaged in
solicitation, he could legally do so
since he was accepting no financial
remuneration.
Beeson said that although Gould
has "the highest moral principles, my
notion of principles that underlie legal
ethics is different. You don't solicit
whether performing for nothing or
not."
No Discrimination
Beeson said, "I know of no instance
of discrimination on the part of the
union and am confident that this will
not be established."
"It is P.l.E.'s position that it has
not engaged in discriminatory conduct
whatsoever," Fastiff said.
"I am worried that this case might
be decided on tha relative numbers of
whites employed, in which case this is
not a case for lawyers," said Beeson.
"It is desirable to work minorities
into the industry," continued Beeson,

who said he thought the Teamsters
were doing this.
Gag Order
In a hearing Feb. 15, U.S. District
Court Judge Robert H. Schnacke
agreed to another hearing on the Feb.
12 motion to be held March 15. He
also slapped a "gag order" on Gould
prohibiting all communications about
the case prior to March 15.
Schnacke imposed the gag order
after the defendants' lawyers
expressed "a great fear" that the
solicitation they charged Gould had
engaged in, would continue until their
motion had been ruled on.
Amsterdam is appealing the
constitutionality of the gag order to
the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court on
Gould's behalf.
"This is an extraordinary case. So
far as we can tell no court has ever
issued a (gag) order of the sort made
by Judge Schnacke," said Amsterdam.
"What happened here would be
unimaginable if it had not happened,"
added Amsterdam.
Fastiff said it would be
"inappropriate at this time" for him to
