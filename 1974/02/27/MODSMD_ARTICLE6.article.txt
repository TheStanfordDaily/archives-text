# Marijuana Ballot Stalls For Lack Of Signatures

Sponsors of the 1974 California
Marijuana Initiative (CMI), a proposed
ballot measure to de-criminalize
possession of the weed, will probably
have to try again in 1975.
Andrea Belsky of the San Francisco
office of Marijuana Mobilization, the
initiative's sponsoring organization,
doubted that enough signatures had
been collected on petitions to put the
CMI on the ballot in November. She
said that over 350,000 signatures were
gathered statewide, but expects that
30 to 50 percent of the signatures will
prove invalid. To make the ballot, the
measure requires 325,504 valid
signatures.
The petitions were submitted to
county clerks throughout the state
Monday. According to Belsky, it will
be "about three weeks" before the

state will announce the official total.
"We can safely say that we will not
make it this time," she added.
However, the movement to legalize
marijuana in California will not die,
according to Belsky. Plans are already
under way for a statewide meeting of
CMI supporters March 9 in Berkeley to
determine the next step. 'They have
not put us under yet," said Belsky.
If passed by the voters, the CMI
would remove all criminal penalties for
private use of marijuana by adults,
although it allows for local ordinances
against public use.
Voters defeated a similar measure
on the 1972 ballot, 67 to 33 percent.
However, a recent California poll
showed 51 percent of the state's voters
favor mitigating penalties for use of
the weed.
