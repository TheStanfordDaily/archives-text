# The 						Food Lines

Doyle McManus And Kathy Brady

"I'm a veteran, and I can't get
nothin'," the thin, young black
man said. "The President and the
corporations are going to have to
see how many people are hungry
and angry. This is the greatest
thing that's ever happened in
America."
The anger in his voice was real.
He was 26. He had gone to
Vietnam, he had returned, and
now he was unemployed, standing
in a line for free food.
It is a part of America few
Stanford students know.
'They tell you to go to
college," he said. Some people
from Foothill Junior College had
taken advantage of the crowd, and
were handing out leaflets
advertising vocational training.
"You go to college, and what
then? You're still out of a job."
Line Stopped Moving
It was three in the afternoon,
and 500 people were standing in
line, waiting for boxes of food.
The young man had been in line
since noon. The line had stopped
moving at around two o'clock;
there was no more food, and
nobody knew whether more would
come. But they stayed in line, just
in case.
"I've been waiting here for two
hours, and I'll wait till midnight if
they pass out food," an elderly
white woman said. Her face was
hard and lined, but she was happy
to talk.
"I get $150 a month social
security. I can't live on that. The
kidnaping is very sad, but it's the
only way rich people will listen."
Patricia Hearst had been
kidnaped by the Symbionese
Liberation Army, but there was
little interest in that particular
tragedy in East Palo Alto Friday.
For the 500 people standing in
line, their own lives seemed
tragedy enough.
Some Unemployed
Some were unemployed, with
little hope of finding a job, trying
to live on dwindling
unemployment insurance. Some
were old, trying to live on social
security. A few were crippled.
Some were welfare mothers. Some
had jobs, but were poor enough to
want to wait four hours for ten
dollars worth of food.
Some were particularly hungry
last week; it was nearing the end
of the month, and the welfare

bureaucracies don't always
function well. One woman said
she supplements her husband's
social security with a small U.S.
Navy pension, but her check never
arrived this month.
"My welfare check didn't come
through," said another, "and they
gave me a voucher for five dollars.
Five dollars! You try to feed eight
people on five dollars?"
Admit Kidnaping 'Bad'
Most people were willing to
talk about Patricia Hearst and the
Symbionese Liberation Army, but
few would take an unequivocal
stand. The kidnaping was bad,
they said, but what mattered was
that they were getting some food,
and that was good. No one was
interested in abstruse questions of
the morality of extorted food.
"We need it," a chicana
explained.
"They should have done this
ten years ago," a tiny, 76-year-old
white pensioner said.
Crowd Orderly, Quiet
It was an orderly, quiet crowd.
It included a few drunks, but they
found it difficult to hold a place
in line, and quickly lost their
places. When the food was being
given out, there were a few who
managed to squeeze back in the
crush at the front of the line to
get a second box of food.
But mostly, they were simply
people who were poor enough to
stand in line for four hours for
food that never came.
The rest of the country can
condemn the actions of the SLA.
These people haven't got the
luxury. They simply need the
food.
"They're making him give his
money to poor people," a young
unemployed white man said.
"How did he get all that money?
He stole it from us in the first
place. Rich people are rich
because they're crooks."
"Patricia Hearst?" the young
black veteran said. His eyes
glittered hard. "I don't care if
she's alive or dead or nothing."
His voice was ironic; he
probably didn't mean it. But his
voice was angry too, and there
was ample reason for that.

He was 26. He had gone to
Vietnam, he had returned, and
now he was unemployed, standing
in a line for free food.
It is a part of America few
Stanford students know.
'They tell you to go to
college," he said. Some people
from Foothill Junior College had
taken advantage of the crowd, and
were handing out leaflets
advertising vocational training.
"You go to college, and what
then? You're still out of a job."
Line Stopped Moving
It was three in the afternoon,
and 500 people were standing in
line, waiting for boxes of food.
The young man had been in line
since noon. The line had stopped
moving at around two o'clock;
there was no more food, and
nobody knew whether more would
come. But they stayed in line, just
in case.
"I've been waiting here for two
hours, and I'll wait till midnight if
they pass out food," an elderly
white woman said. Her face was
hard and lined, but she was happy
to talk.
"I get $150 a month social
security. I can't live on that. The
kidnaping is very sad, but it's the
only way rich people will listen."
Patricia Hearst had been
kidnaped by the Symbionese
Liberation Army, but there was
little interest in that particular
tragedy in East Palo Alto Friday.
For the 500 people standing in
line, their own lives seemed
tragedy enough.
Some Unemployed
Some were unemployed, with
little hope of finding a job, trying
to live on dwindling
unemployment insurance. Some
were old, trying to live on social
security. A few were crippled.
Some were welfare mothers. Some
had jobs, but were poor enough to
want to wait four hours for ten
dollars worth of food.
Some were particularly hungry
last week; it was nearing the end
of the month, and the welfare

bureaucracies don't always
function well. One woman said
she supplements her husband's
social security with a small U.S.
Navy pension, but her check never
arrived this month.
"My welfare check didn't come
through," said another, "and they
gave me a voucher for five dollars.
Five dollars! You try to feed eight
people on five dollars?"
Admit Kidnaping 'Bad'
Most people were willing to
talk about Patricia Hearst and the
Symbionese Liberation Army, but
few would take an unequivocal
stand. The kidnaping was bad,
they said, but what mattered was
that they were getting some food,
and that was good. No one was
interested in abstruse questions of
the morality of extorted food.
"We need it," a chicana
explained.
"They should have done this
ten years ago," a tiny, 76-year-old
white pensioner said.
Crowd Orderly, Quiet
It was an orderly, quiet crowd.
It included a few drunks, but they
found it difficult to hold a place
in line, and quickly lost their
places. When the food was being
given out, there were a few who
managed to squeeze back in the
crush at the front of the line to
get a second box of food.
But mostly, they were simply
people who were poor enough to
stand in line for four hours for
food that never came.
The rest of the country can
condemn the actions of the SLA.
These people haven't got the
luxury. They simply need the
food.
"They're making him give his
money to poor people," a young
unemployed white man said.
"How did he get all that money?
He stole it from us in the first
place. Rich people are rich
because they're crooks."
"Patricia Hearst?" the young
black veteran said. His eyes
glittered hard. "I don't care if
she's alive or dead or nothing."
His voice was ironic; he
probably didn't mean it. But his
voice was angry too, and there
was ample reason for that.

were handing out leaflets
advertising vocational training.
"You go to college, and what
then? You're still out of a job."
Line Stopped Moving
It was three in the afternoon,
and 500 people were standing in
line, waiting for boxes of food.
The young man had been in line
since noon. The line had stopped
moving at around two o'clock;
there was no more food, and
nobody knew whether more would
come. But they stayed in line, just
in case.
"I've been waiting here for two
hours, and I'll wait till midnight if
they pass out food," an elderly
white woman said. Her face was
hard and lined, but she was happy
to talk.
"I get $150 a month social
security. I can't live on that. The
kidnaping is very sad, but it's the
only way rich people will listen."
Patricia Hearst had been
kidnaped by the Symbionese
Liberation Army, but there was
little interest in that particular
tragedy in East Palo Alto Friday.
For the 500 people standing in
line, their own lives seemed
tragedy enough.
Some Unemployed
Some were unemployed, with
little hope of finding a job, trying
to live on dwindling
unemployment insurance. Some
were old, trying to live on social
security. A few were crippled.
Some were welfare mothers. Some
had jobs, but were poor enough to
want to wait four hours for ten
dollars worth of food.
Some were particularly hungry
last week; it was nearing the end
of the month, and the welfare

bureaucracies don't always
function well. One woman said
she supplements her husband's
social security with a small U.S.
Navy pension, but her check never
arrived this month.
"My welfare check didn't come
through," said another, "and they
gave me a voucher for five dollars.
Five dollars! You try to feed eight
people on five dollars?"
Admit Kidnaping 'Bad'
Most people were willing to
talk about Patricia Hearst and the
Symbionese Liberation Army, but
few would take an unequivocal
stand. The kidnaping was bad,
they said, but what mattered was
that they were getting some food,
and that was good. No one was
interested in abstruse questions of
the morality of extorted food.
"We need it," a chicana
explained.
"They should have done this
ten years ago," a tiny, 76-year-old
white pensioner said.
Crowd Orderly, Quiet
It was an orderly, quiet crowd.
It included a few drunks, but they
found it difficult to hold a place
in line, and quickly lost their
places. When the food was being
given out, there were a few who
managed to squeeze back in the
crush at the front of the line to
get a second box of food.
But mostly, they were simply
people who were poor enough to
stand in line for four hours for
food that never came.
The rest of the country can
condemn the actions of the SLA.
These people haven't got the
luxury. They simply need the
food.
"They're making him give his
money to poor people," a young
unemployed white man said.
"How did he get all that money?
He stole it from us in the first
place. Rich people are rich
because they're crooks."
"Patricia Hearst?" the young
black veteran said. His eyes
glittered hard. "I don't care if
she's alive or dead or nothing."
His voice was ironic; he
probably didn't mean it. But his
voice was angry too, and there
was ample reason for that.
