# SLA And Racism
## 
### 
Linda Ho 1

If Bill Evers were black, and
Sam Greenlee and the
revolutionaries in his novel were
white, Charles Ogletree would
have a hard time arguing that
Evers' recent column (Daily, Feb.
14) portrayed white people as
"enemies of the people."
Therefore, to the extent that Mr.
Ogletree's opinion column has any
persuasive force, it must rely
entirely on the particular race of
the principals involved.
Prevailing paranoia about
ulterior racist motives behind
arguments leads me to speculate
on how I am to be characterized. I
suppose insofar as I agreed with
Ogletree I would be a member of
the third world in good standing,
and, as such, I would be exempted
(as he exempts himself) from the
universally acknowledged truth
that "a product of Stanford" is
intellectually incapable of
diagnosing the coming of the
revolution.
However, since I think the
validity or invalidity of arguments
is independent of the race of their
proponents, I suppose my
credentials as a commentator on
any issue involving race and
revolution are automatically
suspect.
Cooling Ambience
Now that intimations of
fallibility have been dealt with, let
me address myself to the cooling
effect of the ambience which
produces arguments such as those
of Ogletree's. It makes rational
discussion on racial issues almost
impossible insofar as it intimidates
truthful statements about any
member of any minority group if
the statements are unflattering,
pejorative, or just plain
unwelcome.
My question is, why do people
allow themselves, or others, to be
reduced to their skin color, sex,
size and shape of their big toe, or
any other characteristic over
which they have no volitional
control and which says nothing

about them, morally or
qualitatively? Why does Ogletree
presume, on behalf of his fellow
blacks, that they are degraded, or
can be degraded, or will be
perceived to be degraded, by any
comparison Evers chooses to
make between a novel and the
SLA (which, as Evers pointed out,
is multiracial)?
If Mr. Evers' article, which I
thought was informational and
not judgmental in nature, can be
construed as an attack on some
blacks who are members of the
SLA, why does Mr. Ogletree insist
that his fellow blacks will suffer
guilt by association unless he
himself cannot distinguish a
person from his skin color?
What Is Gained?
Being a member of a minority
group, I am quite aware that I am
considered a demerit to my race,
in the eyes of some Chinese and
some whites, by not making an
issue of it; I also realize that the
reactions of some minority people
are likely to be hypersensitive and
emotional. I don't see what is to
be gained, however, by knuckling
under to those very faults which
produced racism in the first place.
The inability of some whites to
stand up to emotional blackmail
from some minority members is
distressing to me. Being accorded
special privileges as a minority
member is just as stupid as being
despised for it, because both
actions stem from a common
blindness towards my
individuality. But it is not
degrading, because if another
person chooses to see me in terms
of inessentials, it is his problem,
not mine.
So it isn't strange that I
wonder sometimes what kind of
ball game the whole minority trip
is. If the object is nol to get to the
point where people are
acknowledged, warts and all, for
what they are, regardless of skin
color, I wish someone would have
the honesty to say so.
In the meantime, until this
happens, I resent the
characterization of rational
dialogue as racism. It isn't
truthful, it isn't in good faith, and
it hurts minorities more than any
other gorup.

If Bill Evers were black, and
Sam Greenlee and the
revolutionaries in his novel were
white, Charles Ogletree would
have a hard time arguing that
Evers' recent column (Daily, Feb.
14) portrayed white people as
"enemies of the people."
Therefore, to the extent that Mr.
Ogletree's opinion column has any
persuasive force, it must rely
entirely on the particular race of
the principals involved.
Prevailing paranoia about
ulterior racist motives behind
arguments leads me to speculate
on how I am to be characterized. I
suppose insofar as I agreed with
Ogletree I would be a member of
the third world in good standing,
and, as such, I would be exempted
(as he exempts himself) from the
universally acknowledged truth
that "a product of Stanford" is
intellectually incapable of
diagnosing the coming of the
revolution.
However, since I think the
validity or invalidity of arguments
is independent of the race of their
proponents, I suppose my
credentials as a commentator on
any issue involving race and
revolution are automatically
suspect.
Cooling Ambience
Now that intimations of
fallibility have been dealt with, let
me address myself to the cooling
effect of the ambience which
produces arguments such as those
of Ogletree's. It makes rational
discussion on racial issues almost
impossible insofar as it intimidates
truthful statements about any
member of any minority group if
the statements are unflattering,
pejorative, or just plain
unwelcome.
My question is, why do people
allow themselves, or others, to be
reduced to their skin color, sex,
size and shape of their big toe, or
any other characteristic over
which they have no volitional
control and which says nothing

about them, morally or
qualitatively? Why does Ogletree
presume, on behalf of his fellow
blacks, that they are degraded, or
can be degraded, or will be
perceived to be degraded, by any
comparison Evers chooses to
make between a novel and the
SLA (which, as Evers pointed out,
is multiracial)?
If Mr. Evers' article, which I
thought was informational and
not judgmental in nature, can be
construed as an attack on some
blacks who are members of the
SLA, why does Mr. Ogletree insist
that his fellow blacks will suffer
guilt by association unless he
himself cannot distinguish a
person from his skin color?
What Is Gained?
Being a member of a minority
group, I am quite aware that I am
considered a demerit to my race,
in the eyes of some Chinese and
some whites, by not making an
issue of it; I also realize that the
reactions of some minority people
are likely to be hypersensitive and
emotional. I don't see what is to
be gained, however, by knuckling
under to those very faults which
produced racism in the first place.
The inability of some whites to
stand up to emotional blackmail
from some minority members is
distressing to me. Being accorded
special privileges as a minority
member is just as stupid as being
despised for it, because both
actions stem from a common
blindness towards my
individuality. But it is not
degrading, because if another
person chooses to see me in terms
of inessentials, it is his problem,
not mine.
So it isn't strange that I
wonder sometimes what kind of
ball game the whole minority trip
is. If the object is nol to get to the
point where people are
acknowledged, warts and all, for
what they are, regardless of skin
color, I wish someone would have
the honesty to say so.
In the meantime, until this
happens, I resent the
characterization of rational
dialogue as racism. It isn't
truthful, it isn't in good faith, and
it hurts minorities more than any
other gorup.
