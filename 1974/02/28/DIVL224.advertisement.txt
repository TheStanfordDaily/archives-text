The only responsibility of business
is to earn a profit.
Business must help solve today %
social problems.
Which viewpoint is right?
Proponents of each side would say theirs is, and pull out some very telling arguments to
support their case.
And the confusion doesn't stop there. The debate over corporate social responsibility
extends to literally dozens of conflicting factions, offering a broad spectrum of different arguments.
And the only way to form a thoughtful, defensible position of your own is to know as many of
those arguments as possible.
That's the purpose of the Collegiate Information Program—a free collection of opposing
viewpoints—now available to students. By offering it, Standard Oil also hopes to broaden the
lines of communication between our industry and the student community.
Each packet contains statements expressing difTerent positions. CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY: The Need To Get It On?, for instance, includes hundreds of statements
from a dozen different sources.
The first packet, THE ENERGY CRISIS, explores
and it's up to you to decide who makes the most sense,
Every argument has many sides. •
The materials in the Collegiate Information Program were chosen
by a number of college students, selected and retained by Standard *~
for this purpose. 1-r, Steve Strutner, U.C. Berkeley; Greg Ryan, *
