# KZSU Tries To Salvage Power Funds
## 
### DON COX 
As a result of a recent Federal
Communication Commission (FCC)
ruling which denied KZSU's
application for a power increase, a new
antenna and a transmitter power
amplifier valued at $3000 lie uselessly
atop the hill behind the Stanford
campus.
"We're sort of half-way up the
creek," said former KZSU Business
Manager Lloyd Snook. "We don't have
an appeal for the decision [Snook said
the decision was final] and while there
are avenues to follow, I'm not sure
they're worth exploring."
"Until all possibilities are
exhausted, you can't call this a waste
of money," said Snook.
KZSU received assessments of one
dollar per student for three quarters in
1972 to increase their power and to
become stereo spring quarter in 1972.
Snook said of the $30,000 the station
received, $18,000 went for normal
station operating expenses and the
remaining $21,000 was spent for the
stereo conversion and the power
increase.
Transmitters
"The transmitter we had could not
give us satisfactory performance if we
went stereo with it,"he said.
Snook explained that transmitters
come in three parts, a 10 watt exciter,
stereo generator and a power
amplifier. The first two components
would be needed to convert to stereo
and the latter for the anticipated
power increase.
"The cheapest way to buy a
transmitter is buying it all together at
one time," said Snook. "It would have
cost us $1000 more if we had bought
the first two components at one time
and the amplifier later," he added.
"At the time of the decision [to
buy all three parts together], it was a
good decision. KFJC hadn't objected
nor did we know that they would.
But KFJC did object to possible
interference of their broadcasts by an
JiK-rmert KZSU signal and KZSU's
application for a power increase was
denied.
Laws Violated
Mark Lawrence, station engineer,
said "the FCC may have violated laws
in the handling of the application"
especially rules regarding prompt
action on their part to settle cases.
"It is evident that the FCC did not
process it [the application] properly,"
said Snook.
"You can fault them for making
decisions sloppily but that doesn't
mean the decision is fundamentally
wrong," Snook added.
Thus, "out of the $60,000 students
have given us in the last two years,
$3000 can be regarded as a bad
investment," he concluded.
Try Everything
"We have committed ourselves to
try everything reasonable" to achieve
the power increase said Snook.
Among the options KZSU is
investigating, is working out a
compromise with radio station KFJC.
Snook commented, though, that
"relations in the past with them
haven't been exactly friendly."
The student-run station is also
reviewing plans to possibly install the
new antenna anyway and/or to ask for
a smaller power increase.
