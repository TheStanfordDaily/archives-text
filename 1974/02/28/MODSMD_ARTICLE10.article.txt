# Nuclear Strategy Schools Wrong

Last summer, Defense Secretary James R.
Schlesinger revealed that the U.S. missile
force was being retriggered to give the
American government a "counterforce"
capability.
Since then, this new development in the
government's armaments policy has been a
subject of debate in the news media from a
cover story in Time magazine to the columns
of the Op-Ed page of the New York Times.
Beneath the froth of technical lingo, there
is a struggle for political ascendancy going on
between the adherents of two rival American
schools of strategic thought. The trouble is
that both rival schools are wrong. The two
schools are each based on a strategic policy
of nuclear deterrence, a policy which is both
immoral and impractical.
MAD Strategy
The first school of thought favors a
strategy of mutually assured destruction
(which was given the acronym MAD by
opponent Donald Brennan). The adherents of
this heretofore-dominant school, like SLAC
Director Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky, believe
that holding the civilian populations
controlled by enemy governments as
"hostages" threatened by certain nuclear
destruction will produce an armed
equilibrium without nuclear war.
The second school of thought calls for a
strategy of counterforce or
damage-limitation. Adherents to this
viewpoint, like Business School Prof. Henry
S. Rowen (former head of the Rand

Corporation), echo President Nixon and
Defense Secretary Schlesinger in arguing for
offensive forces able to reduce significantly
an enemy government's own offensive
weapons. More specificallly, they seem to be
arguing for highly accurate missiles capable
of striking so-called military targets
(especially, an enemy's hardened missile
silos) with small nuclear warheads.
Each strategic school justifies its own
position and attacks the rival view by basing
its argument on the theory of nuclear
deterrence. The MADmen attack the
counterforce proponents' policies as having
first-strike implications that will upset the
mutual hostage relationship and the existing
balance of terror.
Counterforce Strikes Back
The counterforce proponents strike back
at the MADmen, saying that a counterforce
strategy allows for greater flexibility in
deterrence tactics.
But it is important not to allow oneself to
be drawn into the argument on the weapons
planners' Dr. Strangelove-like terms. Instead,
one must bear in mind that deterrence is
threat deployment; it is not defense in the
sense of defensive force pinpointed against
invasive force.
No violence should ever be employed or
threatened against a non-aggressor. Yet this is
precisely what the strategy of nuclear
deterrence proposes to do. It is definitely
terror on a massive scale and has a great

potential to develop into mass murder.
Response Needed
What is needed in response to government
decision-makers' reliance on nuclear
deterrence is massive popular support from
the citizenry for multilateral disarmament.
Since May 10, 1955, the official stance of
the Soviet Union has been support for
general disarmament with on-site
international inspection. Although the U.S.
and its allies were in favor in principle of
general disarmament before September 1955,
since then they have backed off to a position
supporting partial disarmament. (These facts
are often misrepresented in the American
press; a good account can be found in Philip
Noel-Baker's Arms Race.)
SALT To Stabilize
The recent Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks were, in the words of John Newhouse,
"supposed to persuade each side to abandon
steps that might weaken or jeopardize the
other's assured destruction capacity." In
other words, SALT sought to stabilize and
secure the hostage role of the innocent
civilians.
Instead of threats, hostages, and
annihiliation, what is needed is a popular
upsurge of pressure on governments to agree
to general and complete disarmament down
to police levels (no aerial bombardment,
missiles, biological warfare, etc.), with special
stress on nuclear disarmament.
