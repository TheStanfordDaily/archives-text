# CS' Zone And Controversy

It appears as if Stanford will be
exempted from Santa Clara
County's proposed "city services"
("cs") zone ordinance. University
officials were pleased when the
Santa Clara County Planning
Commission recommended to the
board last week that Stanford be
excluded from the provisions of
the ordinance.
The "cs" ordinance, if passsed
by the »Board of Supervisors,
would force all land bordering
municipalities in the county to
seek annexation to those cities
prior to starting any new building
projects.
The ordinance was designed to
halt indiscriminate urban growth.
University officials argued that a
special amendment excluding
Stanford should be added to the
ordinance. They pointed to
Stanford's long history of careful
planning.
The University has always
retained the services of planners,
and was concerned about the
environmental consequences of its
development long before careful
planning was undertaken by most
institutions. Hence, the University
contended that Stanford is hardly
an irresponsible planner.
Provides Own Services
Univesity officials also
emphasized that Stanford
provides its own municipal
services — including police and
fire department and police
services — in an "exemplary
manner."
The Planning Commission
apparently found these arguments
convincing. But equally important
was Palo Alto's support of the
amendment that would exclude
Stanford from the ordinance.
For a long while, the Palo Alto
City Council refused to endorse
the amendment. It conceded that
the vast majority of the
University's 8800 acres should be

excluded from the zoning
ordinance. But it insisted that
University land fronting on El
Camino Real and the area along
Willow Road west of Pasteur
Drive should be included in the
zoning ordinance.
Palo Alto officials argued that
since those lands weren't used for
academic purposes and bordered
the city, Palo Alto had a
legitimate right to exercise some
control over their use.
PA Veto Power?
Stanford officials argued that
the application of the provisions
of the "cs" zone to the areas
would be tantamount to a virtual
veto power by Palo Alto over
future developments on those
lands.
President Lyman pointed out
that the University would be hurt
if expansion were allowed to run
rampant on the lands. He
emphasized that Stanford's past
record of sensitive planning is
evidence that the University will
continue its careful development.
Palo Alto officials called this a
non sequitur.
Finally, early in January, Palo
Alto and Stanford officials met
with two members of the Planning
Commission and a compromise
was achieved. Palo Alto agreed to
support Stanford's amendment to
the "cs" zone to the proposed
"cs" zoning ordinance. In return,
the University agreed to inform
Palo Alto of future developments
on Stanford land. It also agreed to
limit its blanket use permit for
land development.
Blanket Use Permit
Under the provisions of the
blanket use permit, issued by the
County to Stanford in 1962, the
University was allowed to develop
building projects without
receiving permission from the
County. By the terms of the

limitation agreed to by Stanford
last month, the University would
have to seek a special use permit
from the County when starting
new projects in the arboretum.
For buildings in the land
southwest of Junipero Serra and
along Willow Road between the
Medical Center and the golf
course, Stanford would have to
receive a special use permit from
the county if the buildings were
to exceed a floor space of 5000
feet. But the large majority of
Stanford's land will remain under
the provisions of the blanket use
permit.
In an interview last week,
Robert Studerant, a staff advisor
to the Planning Commission,
noted that Palo Alto's support of
Stanford's amendment was a
primary factor in the decision of

the Commission to recommend to
the Board that it be passed.
Only Exception
Stanford's proposed
amendment to the county's "cs"
zone ordinance would be the only
exception made to the ordinance.
But Stanford is no ordinary land
developer.
The amendment must still be
submitted to careful examination
by the County Board of
Supervisors. But the general
consensus of observers — both in
Palo Alto and at Stanford — is
that if the "cs" zone ordinance is
passed, it will include the
Stanford amendment, allowing
the University to retain control
over its own development.
