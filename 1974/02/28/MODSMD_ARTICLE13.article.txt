# ASSU History

Has the ASSU been enfeebled
by its present structuring?
Indications are that it has, but the
question itself makes one stop and
think. When did the ASSU adopti
the Council of Presidents notion?
Why? And has the change
accomplished its end?
To answer these questions
perhaps an overview of ASSU
history is in order. Though the
Associated Students of Stanford
University was formed two weeks
after the University opened its
doors in 1891, our purposes might
be served best by looking back
over the last six years or so.
In 1967, ASSU President Peter
Lyman resigned from office
thoroughly disgusted with the
lack of real influencing
capabilities inherent to his office.
In 1968, Peter Lyman was
succeeded by Cesare Massarenti
who was elected among
contenders on his pledge to
"make the ASSU powerful."
Unfortunately for the
Administration, Massarenti lived
true to his pledge — for 1968 was
the heyday of the ASSU.
'57 Hours'
During his term as President,
Cesare Massarenti led the
infamous 1968 May 6-8 sit-in at
the Old Union to stop the
Administration from suspending
six students. Many will recall
those classic "57 hours in May,"
as the student body president of
Stanford University was shown on
national television negotiating by
phone with the Administration
from within the Old Union.
The then Provost and Vice
President, Dr. Richard Lyman,
may never forget the "problem
president."
It may be worth mentioning
that Massarenti became one of the
few ASSU presidents to address
the Academic Council, and to
date he is the only president
successfully to call a "student
body meeting" with an
attendance exceeding 1500
students.
'68 Election
The spring of 1968 saw an
interesting election and a massive
turnout of 5746 students. In that
election Denis Hayes barely
defeated Stanford student and
topless dancer Vicky Drake, 3458
to 2136. Vicky had listed her
qualifications as "38-22-36."
It was in 1969 that the student
body adopted the new
Constitution proposed by
President Denis Hayes. It set up
the earlier version of our present
ASSU Senate structuring but did
not call for a "Council of
Presidents."
It was in 1970, a year and a
half after President Massarenti,
that "someone" proposed the
Council of Presidents idea to
"increase efficiency." The
Administration promoted the idea
by backing an ASSU president
pay raise and by agreeing to
finance the additional seats.
Patrick Shea, the ASSU president
at that time, was weaker than his
predecessors and agreed to
everything.
Getting Worse
Today, four years and four
"councils" liter, we're in a
deplorable state. And the
situation shows every indication
of getting worse with every
succeeding council.
What once looked good in
theory has simply proved
impractical in application. The
weakness in the Council of
Presidents lies in its need for
consensus to act. The committee
format ASSU presidency is
presently incapable of providing
decisive action.
Regrettably, during the Row
controversy the Council of
Presidents never took a formal
position. When Jim Friend was
lambasted in the Daily by Jim
Wascher for his lone actions, the
Council of Presidents never issued
a formal statement.
13 Projects, Four Members
As consensus is hard to arrive
at, this year's Council members
have all gone their separate ways.
Presently, the four members are
working on 13 different projects.
The net effect has been to spread
activities too thinly and further
weaken the ASSU presidency as
an institution.
As to whether the change from
a one-man presidency to a Council
of Presidents has achieved its end
— one must ask, whose end? It
may be working for someone, but
certainly not for Stanford
students.

13 Projects, Four Members
As consensus is hard to arrive
at, this year's Council members
have all gone their separate ways.
Presently, the four members are
working on 13 different projects.
The net effect has been to spread
activities too thinly and further
weaken the ASSU presidency as
an institution.
As to whether the change from
a one-man presidency to a Council
of Presidents has achieved its end
— one must ask, whose end? It
may be working for someone, but
certainly not for Stanford
students.

Chris Murray

Has the ASSU been enfeebled
by its present structuring?
Indications are that it has, but the
question itself makes one stop and
think. When did the ASSU adopti
the Council of Presidents notion?
Why? And has the change
accomplished its end?
To answer these questions
perhaps an overview of ASSU
history is in order. Though the
Associated Students of Stanford
University was formed two weeks
after the University opened its
doors in 1891, our purposes might
be served best by looking back
over the last six years or so.
In 1967, ASSU President Peter
Lyman resigned from office
thoroughly disgusted with the
lack of real influencing
capabilities inherent to his office.
In 1968, Peter Lyman was
succeeded by Cesare Massarenti
who was elected among
contenders on his pledge to
"make the ASSU powerful."
Unfortunately for the
Administration, Massarenti lived
true to his pledge — for 1968 was
the heyday of the ASSU.
'57 Hours'
During his term as President,
Cesare Massarenti led the
infamous 1968 May 6-8 sit-in at
the Old Union to stop the
Administration from suspending
six students. Many will recall
those classic "57 hours in May,"
as the student body president of
Stanford University was shown on
national television negotiating by
phone with the Administration
from within the Old Union.
The then Provost and Vice
President, Dr. Richard Lyman,
may never forget the "problem
president."
It may be worth mentioning
that Massarenti became one of the
few ASSU presidents to address
the Academic Council, and to
date he is the only president
successfully to call a "student
body meeting" with an
attendance exceeding 1500
students.
'68 Election
The spring of 1968 saw an
interesting election and a massive
turnout of 5746 students. In that
election Denis Hayes barely
defeated Stanford student and
topless dancer Vicky Drake, 3458
to 2136. Vicky had listed her
qualifications as "38-22-36."
It was in 1969 that the student
body adopted the new
Constitution proposed by
President Denis Hayes. It set up
the earlier version of our present
ASSU Senate structuring but did
not call for a "Council of
Presidents."
It was in 1970, a year and a
half after President Massarenti,
that "someone" proposed the
Council of Presidents idea to
"increase efficiency." The
Administration promoted the idea
by backing an ASSU president
pay raise and by agreeing to
finance the additional seats.
Patrick Shea, the ASSU president
at that time, was weaker than his
predecessors and agreed to
everything.
Getting Worse
Today, four years and four
"councils" liter, we're in a
deplorable state. And the
situation shows every indication
of getting worse with every
succeeding council.
What once looked good in
theory has simply proved
impractical in application. The
weakness in the Council of
Presidents lies in its need for
consensus to act. The committee
format ASSU presidency is
presently incapable of providing
decisive action.
Regrettably, during the Row
