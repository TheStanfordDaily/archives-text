# Panelists Relate Career Changes
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Midstream career changes and
the accompanying alternatives in
lifestyles were the topics for the
panel discussion sponsored by the
Planning and Placement Center in
the Tresidder large lounge
Tuesday evening.
The discussion, second in the
two-part series "Merging Lifestyle
and Career," featured Drs.
Richard and Barbara Almond,
members of the Collective
Psycho-Therapy Clinic; Les
Williams, a third year Stanford
law student; Margaret Hodges, a
public information consultant;
and Jim Burch, vice president of
Creative Initiative Foundation.
The panelists all mentioned a
search for more meaning in life as
a definitive factor in their
decisions to switch careers.
"Finding meaning in your life

is what it's all about," said Burch.
Burch, who is 48, is currently vice
president of an advertising agency
in San Francisco, but will be
retiring on April l.(" 'April Fools'
Day' my friends call it," Burch
commented.) He and his wife will
join a planned unit development
in Portola Valley. The Burches
and nine other couples will be
living in a small ten-house cluster
arrangement, where the emphasis
will be on group interaction.
A heightened awareness
brought on by the Vietnam War
and a mind-opening summer at a
commune in Sonoma County
helped the Almonds to decide
that the traditional roles they had
been playing were not what they
wanted. Richard had been
working with Stanford's
department of psychiatry while
Barbara worked part time to

complete her residency, since,
traditionally, her role wasn't as
important as his. After rejecting
the traditional roles, Richard left
his job and the two joined some
friends in working part time for
the Psycho-Therapy Clinic.
For Les Williams, his age (54)
and a new interest in the black
civil rights movement were the
keys in his decision to switch
careers. Williams had been running
a successful dance studio for
years, but despite the material
comforts, he began to be
dissatisfied with his job. Besides
the fact that the job left him little
time for his family, Williams felt
that "something was missing ...
that [my job] wasn't involving
my full capacity."
Physicily, William's age was
beginning to show and small
injuries took "forever" to mend.
Moreover, Williams stated, "I
suddenly felt very black." With a
little encouragement from his
daughters, Williams found himself
swept up in the idea that it was
"time for us to assert ourselves
and help our brothers." Feeling
that he hadn't been contributing
to the community as a black man,
Williams decided to enter law. His
immediate goal will be to work
for the government.
After working in the public
information field for much of her
life, Margaret Hodges decided that
she needed some "mental
refreshment." "I was sick of the
same old thoughts," she said.
Hodges decided to quite work and
go back to college so that she
would be able to "speak from a
broader platform." She is working
again now and is saving money to
go back to school. "I don't set
goals the way I did when I was
younger," she remarks. Her only
goal would be "mental
refreshment. I just want to satisfy
my own desires."
