# 'Blazing Saddles' Ridicules
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Andy Warhol gaily twisted the
old formula western in Ixtnesome
Cowboys, and Alex Deßenzy
found comedy in the first
hard-core western, Powder Burns.
But neither of these outrageous
restructurings of the old west had
the utter zaniness or wide
distribution of Blazing Saddles.
Mel Brooks, a certified crazy,
who got his start writing for Sid
Ceaser on Your Show of Shows in
the 19505, has directed, written,
composed the music and acted in
this film that takes every recent
Western genre and riddles it with
ridicule.
Blazing Saddles does for the
old west what Woody Allen's
Sleeper did for traditional science
fiction, leaving no plot twist and
tum unstoned. Echoes of High
Noon, High Plains Drifter,
McCloud, and dozens of
Randolph Scott westerns provide
the situations which Brooks turns
into side-splitting laughter.
Aiding and abetting Brooks in
this venture to turn the west
inside out are some very
talented comedians, Cleavon
Little, Harvey Korman, Madeline
Kahn (who just received an Oscar
nomination for her role in Paper
Moon) and Slim Pickens. Most
noteworthy, though, are Gene
Wilder as an alcoholic gunfighter,
and Alex Karras as a brutish
strong man with a very thick

skull.
These principal players
combine with a plot of sorts
which should keep audiences in
stitches, provided no one is overly
sensitive to racial humor directed
at Jews, Protestants, Blacks,
Mexicans and Indians. Some sexist
references, like "Teutonic twat,"
and a farting scene almost the
equal of "The Grand Bouffe," are
also included for those whose
funny bone is stimulated by
anal-genital jokes.
The plot is a big joke which
forces the first black sheriff in the
west on the bucolic town of Rock
Ridge, in an effort to force the
townspeople out so the evil
Headly Lamarr (Korman) can
sieze the land and sell it to the
railroad for right-of-way. Little is
the black railroad laborer turned
sheriff, who fends off outraged
townspeople, the. monstrous
Mongo (Karras) and the
Deitrich-like advances of Lili Von
Shtupp (Kahn), with the help of
Jim, the juiced gunfighter, mental
and sexual prowess.
Everything leads to the
climactic showdown, which
completely destroys the evil

Lamarr, as well as any belief
Blazing Saddles would have a
conventional comedy Western
ending like Waterhole No. 3 or
Support Your Local Sheriff. This
showdown breaks out of the
confines of the Old West and into
present-day Hollywood in a way
only a deranged soul like Mel
Brooks could think up. The
ending, however, is actually
weaker than the rest of the film
because it tries to parody too
many things at once.
But that's a small defect in one
of the most outrageously sappy
movies of 1974. One final note:
Don't expect any overt sex or
violence just because Blazing
Saddles is rated "R." It's solely
for the "bad" language, a reason
just as ridiculous as the movie's
beginning, which has the bad guys
serenading black railroad workers
with "De Camptown Races."


TOO CLOSE TO THE EDGE—Roy Ashby (Bootnose) and Chris Persky (Billy) engage in a behind-bars
struggle in The Ballad of Dangerous George.
