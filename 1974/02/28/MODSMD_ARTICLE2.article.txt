## Garriott Tells Of Life In Skylab 
### NANCI COLVERT 
Mixing scientific fact with what at
times seemed almost science fiction,
astronaut and Stanford Electrical
Engineering Prof. Owen Garriott spoke
about "Skylab — Living and Working
in Space" to a group of about 250 last
night in the Physics Lecture Hall.
Garriott narrated a film showing an
astronaut chasing floating food back
to his plate, doing pushups with the
other two crewmen on his back and
lifting a 1000-pound barbell — which
then proceeded to lift him off the
floor of the spacecraft, to the laughter
and applause of the audience.
But the tone of the lecture, and of
the flight, was not always light.
Launched on May 14, 1973, Skylab
was originally an unmanned craft
whose first crew was scheduled for
launching the next day. Plans changed
63 seconds after takeoff, however,
when the micrometeorite and heat
shield was ripped off.
With it went one of the devices
used to convert solar energy to
electricity to operate the space station.
Delay
In the 10-day delay before launch
of the first crew, a thermal "parasol"
was designed and constructed to be
deployed by the astronauts who
inhabited Skylab for four weeks.
Garriott's crew, which was
launched in July for a 60-day stay, had
its own difficulties with the thrusters
on their spacecraft, and had to place
yet another thermal "sail" over the
parasol to keep temperatures in the
craft at a bearable level.
Garriott, currently deputy director
of NASA's Johnson Space Center
while on leave here, said one of the
primary research purposes of the flight
was to determine effects of longterm
weightlessness on the human body.
The previous record for time in
space was set by a Gemini crew years
ago and was only two weeks. The third
Skylab now holds the record of three
months.
No Limit
The result, according to Garriott,
was the discovery that there is
apparently no limit to the amount of
time man can spend in space as long as
preventive measures are taken to
prevent muscle atrophy or, as Garriott

termed it, "getting lazy."
One surprising result of the
experiments was the discovery that,
after the first week or so, the
astronauts developed an immunity to
motion sickness which lasted for about
two months after their return to
Earth.
A major area of study was the sun,
and experiments conducted by the
crew helped establish a connection
between activity on the sun, solar
wind and the weather on Earth.
The third category of experiments
included items such as a survey of the
earth's water resources by means of
infra-red scanners to collect data
showing the amount of snowfall in an

area.
Chlorophyll Content
The scanners can also be used to
determine the chlorophyll content of
various areas of the ocean, and thereby
the amount of food available to
marine life and the probability of a
large fish population.
In addition to the space film,
Garriott showed slides taken by the
crew from the windows of the craft.
Using a 300 mm lense Nikon camera,
the astronauts were able to perceive
such details as the Stanford Linear
Accelerator and the Stanford
Industrial Park.
Using binoculars, they could see
water rushing through the spillways of

the Aswan Dam on the Nile River.
"Although we were in space just
shortly before hostilities began in the
Middle East, we couldn't see any signs
of activity from our vantage point,"
Garriott observed.
Individual Experiments
Approximately 100 individual
experiments were performed in space,
some of which were suggestions of
high school students.
One of these concerned the ability
of a spider to spin a web in a
weightless enviornment.
According to Garriott, after a few
false starts, the spider succeeded in
spinning a symmetrical web of which
any earthbound member of the species
could be justifiably proud.
Answering a question from the
audience, Garriott explained that
danger from cosmic radiation was
measured to be relatively low —
"about equal to several full body
X-rays," he said.

the Aswan Dam on the Nile River.
"Although we were in space just
shortly before hostilities began in the
Middle East, we couldn't see any signs
of activity from our vantage point,"
Garriott observed.
Individual Experiments
Approximately 100 individual
experiments were performed in space,
some of which were suggestions of
high school students.
One of these concerned the ability
of a spider to spin a web in a
weightless enviornment.
According to Garriott, after a few
false starts, the spider succeeded in
spinning a symmetrical web of which
any earthbound member of the species
could be justifiably proud.
Answering a question from the
audience, Garriott explained that
danger from cosmic radiation was
measured to be relatively low —
"about equal to several full body
X-rays," he said.
Mixing scientific fact with what at
times seemed almost science fiction,
astronaut and Stanford Electrical
Engineering Prof. Owen Garriott spoke
about "Skylab — Living and Working
in Space" to a group of about 250 last
night in the Physics Lecture Hall.
Garriott narrated a film showing an
astronaut chasing floating food back
to his plate, doing pushups with the
other two crewmen on his back and
lifting a 1000-pound barbell — which
then proceeded to lift him off the
floor of the spacecraft, to the laughter
and applause of the audience.
But the tone of the lecture, and of
the flight, was not always light.
Launched on May 14, 1973, Skylab
was originally an unmanned craft
whose first crew was scheduled for
launching the next day. Plans changed
63 seconds after takeoff, however,
when the micrometeorite and heat
shield was ripped off.
With it went one of the devices
used to convert solar energy to
electricity to operate the space station.
Delay
In the 10-day delay before launch
of the first crew, a thermal "parasol"
was designed and constructed to be
deployed by the astronauts who
inhabited Skylab for four weeks.
Garriott's crew, which was
launched in July for a 60-day stay, had
its own difficulties with the thrusters
on their spacecraft, and had to place
yet another thermal "sail" over the
parasol to keep temperatures in the
craft at a bearable level.
Garriott, currently deputy director
of NASA's Johnson Space Center
while on leave here, said one of the
primary research purposes of the flight
was to determine effects of longterm
weightlessness on the human body.
The previous record for time in
space was set by a Gemini crew years
ago and was only two weeks. The third
Skylab now holds the record of three
months.
No Limit
The result, according to Garriott,
was the discovery that there is
apparently no limit to the amount of
time man can spend in space as long as
preventive measures are taken to
prevent muscle atrophy or, as Garriott

termed it, "getting lazy."
One surprising result of the
experiments was the discovery that,
after the first week or so, the
astronauts developed an immunity to
motion sickness which lasted for about
two months after their return to
Earth.
A major area of study was the sun,
