# World Premiere Engagement
## 'Ballad' Crackles With Fury 
### LAURA PULA 
SAN FRANCISCO - As in
those last, ominous moments
preceding the outbreak of a raging
hurricane, the beginning of The
Ballad of Dangerous George
crackles with suppressed fury. The
first scene is of the
blood-spattered body of George
T. Jones, lying in a prison
courtyard. An announcement
blamed from a loudspeaker reveals
that the "carcass" will remain in
place for three days as a lesson
and a deterrent to any potential
troublemakers. This prologue,
then, is an apt introduction to the
drama of caged desperation and
racial conflict that follows, via
flashback, as an explanation of
the • circumstances of George's
death.
Ballad, in its world premiere
engagement at the Artist
Enterprise Theatre, is the taut,
often powerful first work of
forty-one year old Ken Whelan.
Whelan has spent fifteen of his
adult years in various prisons,
including San Quentin, and
therefore writes with the
authority of first-hand experience.
(The playwright, states the
program, "denies any attempt to
depict the life of George
Jackson"). Much of his play,
although it occasionally lapses
into some preachy rhetoric, is
instilled with a raw and biting
sincerity.
At the start, George comes
swaggering back to prison on a
minor parole violation, and insists
that all he wants to do is serve his
time. But that is not meant to be,
for George is immediately trapped
in a savage conflict between two
segments of prisoners: the
Neo-Nazis and the Black Muslims.
He attempts to play the role of an
impartial peacemaker, but is
forced to side with his fellow
blacks because of the guard's
racist treatment and total
disregard of his neutrality. As a
result, George's trust in his
comrades is soon eroded as he
realizes that there is no such
concept as "fair play" behind
bars. Further, George's fate is

ironically foreshadowed when he
declares, "I'm alive — alive is my
middle name!"
There is some excellent
satirical dialogue when George
first confronts his old friends. Sly,
clever Bootnose proclaims that he
is now a "sanitary engine-e-r," to
which George returns "You mean
they got you cleanin' the
shithouse!" Bootnose then
admonishes George not to make
fun of their "Re-habili-faf/on
program."
When Jamal Abdul, the Muslim
leader, assures George that "we
got a movement," George retorts,
"Ain't nothin' movin' here except
time!" Later, summoned by the
captain to his office (the Captain
who declares, at one point, that
the administration could "make a
few concessions to relieve the
pressure, but from then on it's
brute force!"), George wryly
commands the others to watch
him go into his "abject nigger
routine."
'Shitty Smitty'
One really fascinating character
is introduced in the person of old
Jason Smith, arsonist-murderer of
thirty-nine children, recipient of a
Christmas commutation of his
death sentence, inhabitant of the
prison for forty years and habitual
feeder of seagulls. His nickname
is, descriptively, "Shitty Smitty,"
bestowed by the other prisoners
who were disgusted at his filth. He
confides, however, that dirt is the
only thing that enables him to be
left alone. Smitty's pet refrain is
that all the different prison
factions, all apparent progress or
change, are all fleeting,
ineffective, and meaningless. His
term for these temporary
pasttimes is "shuckin'," and he
cackles, "You gotta make believe
to make it."
One of the very best moments
in Ballad comes during a so-called
group therapy session, established
to help the prisoners discover
their true selves. The men, for a
rare moment, join together against
the weak and jargon-spewing
psychologist. Their jeers and

taunts reveal the frustration they
feel at having their problems dealt
with in this impractical manner.
Resentment is voiced at being
used as "guinea pigs" and, at one
point, a cynical inquiry is made as
to how could they worry about
"introspection" when they were
struggling to survive?
The Ballad of Dangerous
George is an extremely
worthwhile first dramatic effort,
although it does have its rough
edges. The acting is superb overall,
with standout performances given
by the commanding A 1 White
(George), and Ray Ashby
(Bootnose). Chris Persky, who
plays the sensitive little punk
Billy, and David Froman, as the
brutal guard who himself is really
part convict, are both very good.
Rhetoric
The author's point is
sometimes obscured,
unfortunately, by unrealistic,
rhetorical words. The crass
attitude of the prison
administration is sometimes
illustrated to the point of
absurdity, as when it is
announced, at a time when
tempers are boiling, that a
suggestion box is being set up for
airing grievances. This is obviously
ridiculously inadequate, and
seems to overstate the case.
Finally, one who attends a

performance of The Ballad of
Dangerous George is treated not
only to a fine evening's
entertainment, but also to an
intriguing exhibition of art
created by convicts that is
displayed in the Enterprise
Theatre's lobby, forming an
appropriate backdrop of reality to
complement the "fictional"
drama.

Finally, one who attends a

performance of The Ballad of
Dangerous George is treated not

appropriate backdrop of reality to

drama.
SAN FRANCISCO - As in
those last, ominous moments
preceding the outbreak of a raging
hurricane, the beginning of The
Ballad of Dangerous George
crackles with suppressed fury. The
first scene is of the
blood-spattered body of George
T. Jones, lying in a prison
courtyard. An announcement
blamed from a loudspeaker reveals
that the "carcass" will remain in
place for three days as a lesson
and a deterrent to any potential
troublemakers. This prologue,
then, is an apt introduction to the
drama of caged desperation and
racial conflict that follows, via
flashback, as an explanation of
the • circumstances of George's
death.
Ballad, in its world premiere
engagement at the Artist
Enterprise Theatre, is the taut,
often powerful first work of
forty-one year old Ken Whelan.
Whelan has spent fifteen of his
adult years in various prisons,
including San Quentin, and
therefore writes with the
authority of first-hand experience.
(The playwright, states the
program, "denies any attempt to
depict the life of George
Jackson"). Much of his play,
although it occasionally lapses
into some preachy rhetoric, is
instilled with a raw and biting
sincerity.
At the start, George comes
swaggering back to prison on a
minor parole violation, and insists
that all he wants to do is serve his
time. But that is not meant to be,
for George is immediately trapped
in a savage conflict between two
segments of prisoners: the
Neo-Nazis and the Black Muslims.
He attempts to play the role of an
impartial peacemaker, but is
forced to side with his fellow
blacks because of the guard's
racist treatment and total
disregard of his neutrality. As a
result, George's trust in his
comrades is soon eroded as he
realizes that there is no such
concept as "fair play" behind
bars. Further, George's fate is

ironically foreshadowed when he
declares, "I'm alive — alive is my
middle name!"
There is some excellent
satirical dialogue when George
first confronts his old friends. Sly,
clever Bootnose proclaims that he
is now a "sanitary engine-e-r," to
which George returns "You mean
they got you cleanin' the
shithouse!" Bootnose then
admonishes George not to make
fun of their "Re-habili-faf/on
program."
When Jamal Abdul, the Muslim
leader, assures George that "we
got a movement," George retorts,
"Ain't nothin' movin' here except
time!" Later, summoned by the
captain to his office (the Captain
who declares, at one point, that
the administration could "make a
few concessions to relieve the
pressure, but from then on it's
brute force!"), George wryly
commands the others to watch
him go into his "abject nigger
routine."
'Shitty Smitty'
One really fascinating character
is introduced in the person of old
Jason Smith, arsonist-murderer of
thirty-nine children, recipient of a
Christmas commutation of his
death sentence, inhabitant of the
prison for forty years and habitual
feeder of seagulls. His nickname
is, descriptively, "Shitty Smitty,"
bestowed by the other prisoners
who were disgusted at his filth. He
confides, however, that dirt is the
only thing that enables him to be
left alone. Smitty's pet refrain is
that all the different prison
factions, all apparent progress or
change, are all fleeting,
ineffective, and meaningless. His
term for these temporary
pasttimes is "shuckin'," and he
cackles, "You gotta make believe
to make it."
One of the very best moments
in Ballad comes during a so-called
group therapy session, established
to help the prisoners discover
their true selves. The men, for a
rare moment, join together against
the weak and jargon-spewing
psychologist. Their jeers and

taunts reveal the frustration they
feel at having their problems dealt
with in this impractical manner.
Resentment is voiced at being
used as "guinea pigs" and, at one
point, a cynical inquiry is made as
to how could they worry about
"introspection" when they were
struggling to survive?
The Ballad of Dangerous
George is an extremely
worthwhile first dramatic effort,
although it does have its rough
edges. The acting is superb overall,
with standout performances given
by the commanding A 1 White
(George), and Ray Ashby
(Bootnose). Chris Persky, who
plays the sensitive little punk
Billy, and David Froman, as the
brutal guard who himself is really
part convict, are both very good.
Rhetoric
The author's point is
sometimes obscured,
unfortunately, by unrealistic,
rhetorical words. The crass
attitude of the prison
administration is sometimes
illustrated to the point of
absurdity, as when it is
announced, at a time when
tempers are boiling, that a
suggestion box is being set up for
airing grievances. This is obviously
ridiculously inadequate, and
seems to overstate the case.

attitude of the prison
administration is sometimes
illustrated to the point of
absurdity, as when it is
announced, at a time when
tempers are boiling, that a
suggestion box is being set up for
airing grievances. This is obviously
ridiculously inadequate, and
seems to overstate the case.
Finally, one who attends a

performance of The Ballad of
Dangerous George is treated not
only to a fine evening's
entertainment, but also to an
intriguing exhibition of art
created by convicts that is
displayed in the Enterprise
Theatre's lobby, forming an
appropriate backdrop of reality to
complement the "fictional"
drama.
SAN FRANCISCO - As in
those last, ominous moments
preceding the outbreak of a raging
hurricane, the beginning of The
Ballad of Dangerous George
crackles with suppressed fury. The
first scene is of the
blood-spattered body of George
T. Jones, lying in a prison
courtyard. An announcement
blamed from a loudspeaker reveals
that the "carcass" will remain in
place for three days as a lesson
and a deterrent to any potential
troublemakers. This prologue,
then, is an apt introduction to the
drama of caged desperation and
racial conflict that follows, via
flashback, as an explanation of
the • circumstances of George's
death.
Ballad, in its world premiere
engagement at the Artist
Enterprise Theatre, is the taut,
often powerful first work of
forty-one year old Ken Whelan.
Whelan has spent fifteen of his
adult years in various prisons,
including San Quentin, and
therefore writes with the
authority of first-hand experience.
(The playwright, states the
program, "denies any attempt to
depict the life of George
Jackson"). Much of his play,
although it occasionally lapses
into some preachy rhetoric, is
instilled with a raw and biting
sincerity.
At the start, George comes
swaggering back to prison on a
minor parole violation, and insists
that all he wants to do is serve his
time. But that is not meant to be,
for George is immediately trapped
in a savage conflict between two
segments of prisoners: the
Neo-Nazis and the Black Muslims.
He attempts to play the role of an
impartial peacemaker, but is
forced to side with his fellow
blacks because of the guard's
racist treatment and total
disregard of his neutrality. As a
result, George's trust in his
comrades is soon eroded as he
realizes that there is no such
concept as "fair play" behind
bars. Further, George's fate is

ironically foreshadowed when he
declares, "I'm alive — alive is my
middle name!"
There is some excellent
satirical dialogue when George
first confronts his old friends. Sly,
clever Bootnose proclaims that he
is now a "sanitary engine-e-r," to
which George returns "You mean
they got you cleanin' the
shithouse!" Bootnose then
admonishes George not to make
fun of their "Re-habili-faf/on
program."
When Jamal Abdul, the Muslim
leader, assures George that "we
got a movement," George retorts,
"Ain't nothin' movin' here except
time!" Later, summoned by the
captain to his office (the Captain
who declares, at one point, that
the administration could "make a
few concessions to relieve the
pressure, but from then on it's
brute force!"), George wryly
commands the others to watch
him go into his "abject nigger
routine."
'Shitty Smitty'
One really fascinating character
is introduced in the person of old
Jason Smith, arsonist-murderer of
thirty-nine children, recipient of a
Christmas commutation of his
death sentence, inhabitant of the
prison for forty years and habitual
feeder of seagulls. His nickname
is, descriptively, "Shitty Smitty,"
bestowed by the other prisoners
who were disgusted at his filth. He
confides, however, that dirt is the
only thing that enables him to be
left alone. Smitty's pet refrain is
that all the different prison
factions, all apparent progress or
change, are all fleeting,
ineffective, and meaningless. His
term for these temporary
pasttimes is "shuckin'," and he
cackles, "You gotta make believe
to make it."
One of the very best moments
in Ballad comes during a so-called
group therapy session, established
to help the prisoners discover
their true selves. The men, for a
rare moment, join together against
the weak and jargon-spewing
psychologist. Their jeers and

taunts reveal the frustration they
feel at having their problems dealt
with in this impractical manner.
Resentment is voiced at being
used as "guinea pigs" and, at one
point, a cynical inquiry is made as
to how could they worry about
"introspection" when they were
struggling to survive?
The Ballad of Dangerous
George is an extremely
worthwhile first dramatic effort,
although it does have its rough
edges. The acting is superb overall,
with standout performances given
by the commanding A 1 White
(George), and Ray Ashby
(Bootnose). Chris Persky, who
plays the sensitive little punk
Billy, and David Froman, as the
brutal guard who himself is really
part convict, are both very good.
Rhetoric
The author's point is
sometimes obscured,
unfortunately, by unrealistic,
rhetorical words. The crass
attitude of the prison
administration is sometimes
illustrated to the point of
