Calley Freed By Civilian Judge
COLUMBUS, Ga. - Lt. William L. Calley Jr., the only
man convicted for the massacre of Vietnamese civilians at
My Lai, was released from custody yesterday by a civilian
judge.
"I feel I could be useful to society," Calley told the
judge.
Calley, 30, who has nearly exhausted his appeals for the
murders of at least 22 Vietnamese, smiled and waved at
friends as he walked out of a federal courthouse here, free
for the first time since President Nixon ordered him held in
an apartment three years ago pending appeals.
Close Election Forecast For Britain
LONDON — Public and private pollsters forecast a photo
finish between Laborites and the ruling Conservatives in
Britain's general election today as the nation wound up a
whirlwind three-week campaign.
But most signs yesterday night also suggested a big-time
Liberal revival in the voting. If Liberal leader Jeremy
Thorpe's center party wins a substantial number of seats in
the 635-member House of Commons, it would change the
face of British politics, dominated for nearly a half century
by Conservatives and Laborites.
The crisis-ridden campaign has seen Prime Minister
Edward Heath and Labor chieftain Harold Wilson each
claiming to be the man to halt the nation's slide toward
bankruptcy and class conflict.
Kissinger Delivers POW List
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
came to Israel yesterday carrying a list of Israeli war
prisoners held in Syria, a major break-through in his efforts
to get a disengagement pact for the Golan Heights.
"The list of prisoners is in Israeli hands and is being
deciphered," said Prof. Zvi Eyal, chairman of a group
representing families of the Israeli prisoners.
The White House announced in Washington that Syria
had turned over the list, bearing the names of 65 Israelis,
during talks between Kissinger and Syrian leaders in
Damascus. , _
The announcement also said the International Red Cross
would be permitted to visit the POWs tomorrow morning.
The visits along with the list, represented an Israeli
precondition for participating in the troop disengagement
talks Kissinger is trying to get started.
Reagan Imposes Gasoline Curbs
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan reluctantly
imposed mandatory gasoline buying restrictions on at least

half of California's 12.5 million motorists yesterday.
The so-called odd-and-even plan formally takes effect at
12:01 a.m. tomorrow in all counties declaring gasoline
emergencies.
Reagan listed five counties which have formally asked to
have the plan imposed and said several others are expected
to join today. Officials of three other counties have
publicly said they will join the mandatory gasoline
marketing plan.
Half of California's licensed drivers and 7,038,206 of the
state's 13.8 million autos, trucks and motorcycles are
registered in those eight counties, which include populous
Los Angeles, Orange and Alameda counties.
Reagan also announced formation of state and local
enforcement agencies to police the plan.

Liberation Army.

Close Election Forecast For Britain
LONDON — Public and private pollsters forecast a photo
finish between Laborites and the ruling Conservatives in
Britain's general election today as the nation wound up a
whirlwind three-week campaign.
But most signs yesterday night also suggested a big-time
Liberal revival in the voting. If Liberal leader Jeremy
Thorpe's center party wins a substantial number of seats in
the 635-member House of Commons, it would change the
face of British politics, dominated for nearly a half century
by Conservatives and Laborites.
The crisis-ridden campaign has seen Prime Minister
Edward Heath and Labor chieftain Harold Wilson each
claiming to be the man to halt the nation's slide toward
bankruptcy and class conflict.
Kissinger Delivers POW List
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
came to Israel yesterday carrying a list of Israeli war

to get a disengagement pact for the Golan Heights.

deciphered," said Prof. Zvi Eyal, chairman of a group
representing families of the Israeli prisoners.
The White House announced in Washington that Syria
had turned over the list, bearing the names of 65 Israelis,
during talks between Kissinger and Syrian leaders in
Damascus. , _
The announcement also said the International Red Cross
would be permitted to visit the POWs tomorrow morning.
The visits along with the list, represented an Israeli
precondition for participating in the troop disengagement
talks Kissinger is trying to get started.
