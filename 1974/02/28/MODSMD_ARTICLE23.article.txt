# Business Profs Head Conference

Charging students higher tuition for
small classes and consultations with
professors might make universities
more efficient, according to Business
School Prof. Keith Lumsden, one of
four speakers at yesterday's Stanford
Business Conference at the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn.
'There are indications that some
students can learn at least as well from
videotaped lectures or 'programmed
learning' approaches as they can from
live lectures, yet we use the same
pedagogy for all students and charge
them all the same tuition," Lumsden
told the 200 executives attending the
conference.
"We ought to conduct national
experiments to determine learning
capacities, and then put what we have
learned into effect with some sort of
incentive program for students," he

continued. "The students would be
encouraged to use the technological
improvements like videotaped lectures;
they could pay more for using the
scarce professorial resources in small
classes."
Lumsden called the presence of
thousands of slightly different courses
covering the same subject matter at
American universities as "inefficient."
'The many Economics I courses, for
example, many of them of poor
quality, could be replaced by five or
six well-thought-out courses on
videotape. The result would be not
only cheaper but more productive,"
Lumsden added.
Inflation Continues
Business School Prof. George L.
Bach predicted continued inflation in
his speech. "Higher social security
payments and wage increases will
make inflation very difficult to stop,"
he stated, "but the American people
will never be satisfied unless they keep
getting more, and no politician wants
to tell them they can't.
"Since wage earners are a great
majority in this country, they will be
most effective in avoiding inflation. In
fact, one of the limiting factors on
inflation is that the workers don't
know how much they can really get
away with," he noted.
"Si n .ce everyone now anticipates
inflation, the strongest political forces
will get the greatest shares of income;
the weak forces will be hurt, and it
seems that business is a weak force."
No Sure Hedge
Bach offered advice for those with
money: 'The best way to avoid
inflation in the past has been to invest
in 'liquid assets' like storks and land,
but since everyone knows that now it's
no real advantage to buy those things.
There is probably no surefire way to
avoid being hurt by inflation, but the
worst thing to do is to keep a lot of
cash," said Bach.
Other conference speakers included
Business Lecturer Edward Hamilton,

former deputy mayor and budget
director of New York City, who
discussed government's search for
increased productivity, and investment
consultant James Abegglen, who cited
Japan's rapid advances in productivity.
Jackson Grayson, former chairman of
the Price Commission, was to have
been the keynote speaker at the
conference, but because of illness he
was replaced by Bach.
