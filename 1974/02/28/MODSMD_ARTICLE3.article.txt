# Emergency Energy Bill Gains House Approval
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
passed emergency energy legislation
yesterday, providing for an oil price
rollback and giving President Nixon
the authority to order gasoline
rationing.
The measure now goes to the White
House where it faees an almost certain
veto.
Final passage came after motions to
strike several of the bill's more
controversial provisions, including the
price rollback and rationing authority
were defeated by roll call votes.
Earlier, the House reversed its Rules
Committee and voted down a
parliamentary rule that had threatened
to kill the bill.

The vote on final passage was 258
to 151, short of the two-thirds vote
that would be needed to override a
veto.
Reduce Gas Prices
According to figures from a House
committee the rollback provision
would reduce gasoline prices by up to
four cents a gallon at the pump and
cut propane prices in half.
The American Petroleum Institute
issued a statement saying: "At a time
when the nation needs to focus its
attention on expanding domestic
sources of energy, the Congress has
approved legislation which is certain to
discourage such efforts. The end result
of the price rollback provision
contained in the legislation will be a
drop in our supply of crude oil."
Motion Defeated
A motion to strike the rollback
section from the bill was defeated 238
to 173.
The House turned down the
parliamentary rule on a 259 to 144
vote.
Instead, it adopted a compromise
rule proposed by House Commerce
Committee Chairman Harley O.
Staggers, D-W.Va., floor manager of
the bill, calling for full-scale roll-call
votes on the price rollback, rationing
authority and a section giving the
President temporary authority to put
energy conservation plans into effect
without first seeking Congressional
approval.
Original Rule
Under the original rule, a challenge
to the legislation could have come on
the rollback provision on the grounds
that it was drafted by a Senate-House
conference and was never voted upon
by the full House.

In other related developments:
— The Federal Energy Office
acknowledged serious deficiencies in
its crude-oil allocation program and
announced several changes intended to
increase oil imports into the United
States.
Court Denies Bid
— A federal appeals court in
Washington turned down a bid by the
state of Maryland to increase its
gasoline allotment, reversing a lower
court decision that had directed the
FEO to increase the state's allotment
by 16 million gallons.
— Federal energy chief William E.
Simon repeated his contradiction of a
statement by the Shah of Iran that the
United States is importing as much oil
now as before the Arab boycott. Sen.
Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., supported
Simon. They spoke on separate
morning broadcast shows.
Presidential Veto
Nixon said at his Monday news
conference that he planned to veto the
emergency energy legislation "if it
reaches my desk in its present form."
Nixon said the bill's rollback
provision, while "immediately
popular," would lead to further
shortages "which would require
without question, rationing all over
the country."
Opponents of the measure argue
that the rollback would reduce oil
company profit margins, thereby
removing incentives to drill for
additional supplies of oil.
The rollback would set the price of
all oil produced in the United States at
$5.25 per barrel and set a ceiling of
$7.09 per barrel beyond which the
price could not rise.

Motion Defeated
A motion to strike the rollback
section from the bill was defeated 238
to 173.
The House turned down the
parliamentary rule on a 259 to 144
vote.
Instead, it adopted a compromise
rule proposed by House Commerce
Committee Chairman Harley O.
Staggers, D-W.Va., floor manager of
the bill, calling for full-scale roll-call
votes on the price rollback, rationing
authority and a section giving the
President temporary authority to put
energy conservation plans into effect
without first seeking Congressional
approval.
Original Rule
Under the original rule, a challenge
to the legislation could have come on
the rollback provision on the grounds
that it was drafted by a Senate-House
conference and was never voted upon
by the full House.

In other related developments:
— The Federal Energy Office
acknowledged serious deficiencies in
its crude-oil allocation program and
announced several changes intended to
increase oil imports into the United
States.
Court Denies Bid
— A federal appeals court in
Washington turned down a bid by the
state of Maryland to increase its
gasoline allotment, reversing a lower
court decision that had directed the
FEO to increase the state's allotment
by 16 million gallons.
— Federal energy chief William E.
Simon repeated his contradiction of a
statement by the Shah of Iran that the
United States is importing as much oil
now as before the Arab boycott. Sen.
Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., supported
Simon. They spoke on separate
morning broadcast shows.
Presidential Veto
Nixon said at his Monday news
conference that he planned to veto the
emergency energy legislation "if it
reaches my desk in its present form."
Nixon said the bill's rollback
provision, while "immediately
popular," would lead to further
shortages "which would require
without question, rationing all over
the country."
Opponents of the measure argue
that the rollback would reduce oil
company profit margins, thereby
removing incentives to drill for
additional supplies of oil.
The rollback would set the price of
all oil produced in the United States at
$5.25 per barrel and set a ceiling of
$7.09 per barrel beyond which the
price could not rise.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
passed emergency energy legislation
yesterday, providing for an oil price
rollback and giving President Nixon
the authority to order gasoline
rationing.
The measure now goes to the White
House where it faees an almost certain
veto.
Final passage came after motions to
strike several of the bill's more
controversial provisions, including the
price rollback and rationing authority
were defeated by roll call votes.
Earlier, the House reversed its Rules
Committee and voted down a
parliamentary rule that had threatened
to kill the bill.

The vote on final passage was 258
to 151, short of the two-thirds vote
that would be needed to override a
veto.
Reduce Gas Prices
According to figures from a House
committee the rollback provision
would reduce gasoline prices by up to
four cents a gallon at the pump and
cut propane prices in half.
The American Petroleum Institute
issued a statement saying: "At a time
when the nation needs to focus its
attention on expanding domestic
sources of energy, the Congress has
approved legislation which is certain to
discourage such efforts. The end result
of the price rollback provision
contained in the legislation will be a
drop in our supply of crude oil."
