# Officials: SLA Tied To Other Groups
## 
### GLENN GARVIN KEVIN SMITH 
California law enforcement
authorities believe that the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA),
the terrorist group that claims credit
for kidnaping Patricia Hearst, is
involved with several other radical
groups and prison gangs.
The SLA, which earlier said it was
responsible for the murder of Oakland
School Superintendent Marcus Foster
last November, has produced tape
recordings of the 20-year old
publishing heiress who was kidnaped
on Feb. 4.
The SLA has demanded $6 million
worth of food for poor people before
negotiations for her return can begin.
California officials say they have
begun to trace an intricate web
between her kidnapers and a number
of other groups they regard as
extremely dangerous.
All the groups have one thing in
common: they operate throughout the
California state prison system. And it
was in the prisons that they first made
contact with the SLA, according to
the officials.
Unofficial Suspects
The two chief unofficial suspects
in the Hearst kidnaping are both
prison escapees: Donald DeFreeze, 30,

who slipped away from the California
Training Facility in Soledad, and
Thero M. Wheeler, 29, who left the
California Medical Facility in
Vacaville.
Inmates who did time with
DeFreeze have identified his voice as
the one on tapes from the SLA that
claims to be "Cinque" — the group's
"field marshal." DeFreeze is also a
leader of the Black Guerilla Family
(BGF), according to authorities.
The BGF, long an obscure prison
gang, gained prominence recently after
two inmates in the state prison at
Tracy were killed in what authorities
claim way a BGF "initiation rite."
Venceremos Member
Wheeler was once a member of
Venceremos, a Bay Area Maoist
revolutionary group which reportedly
disbanded last fall. While Wheeler was
imprisoned, a number of Venceremos
members wrote letters to the
California Adult Authority asking for
his parole.
Authorities do not believe that
Wheeler's participation in Venceremos
is a coincidence; they theorize that a
split in the group over the issue of

urban guerilla violence as a political
tool may have produced the SLA, or
at least a large part of it.
Bruce Franklin, a fired Stanford
associate English professor who was on
the Venceremos Central Committee
throughout its existence, said the
theory "is getting- me pissed off.
People will go through the
goddamndest mental contortions I
ever heard to link the SLA and
Venceremos."
Franklin maintained an article
appearing in the May issue of the
Venceremos newspaper discussing
"spontaneous struggle" was not a
denunciation of individual violence.
"There's nothing wrong with
spontaneous struggle," Franklin told
the Daily. "The problem is that people
demand more of any organization tha
provides leadership."
'Self Criticism'
The article, which was labeled "Self
Criticism," dealt with the newspaper
itself, Franklin said. "It was talking
about the newspaper as an organ of
information. It was not providing a
scientific analysis of what these
struggles mean," he claimed.

Law enforcement authorities do
not accept Franklin's explanation.
They insist that a split in the group
provided much of the impetus for the
formation of the SLA.
They are, however, checking a
report that Wheeler left the SLA after
the Foster killing and didn't
participate in the kidnaping.
Wheeler Meets DeFreeze
Even if they should find that
Wheeler did drop out of the SLA,
authorities say he was once a member.
They believe he met with DeFreeze
and other SLA members in the Black
Cultural Association at Vacaville while
they were both inmates there.
One radical-watcher advised the
Department of Corrections to "be
damn careful" of anyone who
participated in the Black Cultural
Association.
Officials claim that several other
prison gangs are also involved. The
Mexican Mafia and the New Family,
two feuding chicano gangs that extend
their operations outside of prison
walls, also hover on the periphery,
officials say. They think the two

members to the SLA.
SLA Denials
Despite SLA denials, these officials
also believe that the August 7 Guerilla
Movement, an organization that
threatened prison personnel last
summer in retribution for the death of
San Quentin inmate George Jackson
ov«r two years ago, is the same group
as the SLA.
Franklin told the Daily that official
fears about the nature of the SLA
were "a fantasy novel. They probably
get their material from the same place
E. Howard Hunt gets his fictional
stuff."
But many officials are now carrying
guns, fearing they could be marked for
SLA action. Some have even moved
their families and taken other more
severe precautionary actions. They
agree with the analysis of one veteran
observer of the radical scene.
"Look at them," he said. "They
[the SLA] haven't been able to get
any money or support for their people
[in San Quentin], no defense
committees or anything. No one
rallied to their side after they pulled
off what they thought was a big favor:
the Foster killing.
"They're desperate. They've got to
do something big to make an
impression. They will keep making one
big play after another until they get
their popular following."

groups have contributed a number of
members to the SLA.
SLA Denials
Despite SLA denials, these officials
also believe that the August 7 Guerilla
Movement, an organization that
threatened prison personnel last
summer in retribution for the death of
San Quentin inmate George Jackson
ov«r two years ago, is the same group
as the SLA.
Franklin told the Daily that official
fears about the nature of the SLA
were "a fantasy novel. They probably
get their material from the same place
E. Howard Hunt gets his fictional
stuff."
But many officials are now carrying
guns, fearing they could be marked for
SLA action. Some have even moved
their families and taken other more
severe precautionary actions. They
agree with the analysis of one veteran
observer of the radical scene.
"Look at them," he said. "They
[the SLA] haven't been able to get
any money or support for their people
[in San Quentin], no defense
committees or anything. No one
rallied to their side after they pulled
off what they thought was a big favor:
the Foster killing.
"They're desperate. They've got to
do something big to make an
impression. They will keep making one
big play after another until they get
their popular following."
California law enforcement
authorities believe that the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA),
the terrorist group that claims credit
for kidnaping Patricia Hearst, is
involved with several other radical
groups and prison gangs.
The SLA, which earlier said it was
responsible for the murder of Oakland
School Superintendent Marcus Foster
last November, has produced tape
recordings of the 20-year old
publishing heiress who was kidnaped
on Feb. 4.
The SLA has demanded $6 million
worth of food for poor people before
negotiations for her return can begin.
California officials say they have
begun to trace an intricate web
between her kidnapers and a number
of other groups they regard as
extremely dangerous.
All the groups have one thing in
common: they operate throughout the
California state prison system. And it
was in the prisons that they first made
contact with the SLA, according to
the officials.
Unofficial Suspects
The two chief unofficial suspects
in the Hearst kidnaping are both
prison escapees: Donald DeFreeze, 30,

who slipped away from the California
Training Facility in Soledad, and
Thero M. Wheeler, 29, who left the
California Medical Facility in
Vacaville.
Inmates who did time with
DeFreeze have identified his voice as
the one on tapes from the SLA that
claims to be "Cinque" — the group's
"field marshal." DeFreeze is also a
leader of the Black Guerilla Family
(BGF), according to authorities.
The BGF, long an obscure prison
gang, gained prominence recently after
two inmates in the state prison at
Tracy were killed in what authorities
claim way a BGF "initiation rite."
Venceremos Member
Wheeler was once a member of
Venceremos, a Bay Area Maoist
revolutionary group which reportedly
disbanded last fall. While Wheeler was
imprisoned, a number of Venceremos
members wrote letters to the
California Adult Authority asking for
his parole.
Authorities do not believe that
Wheeler's participation in Venceremos
is a coincidence; they theorize that a
split in the group over the issue of

urban guerilla violence as a political
tool may have produced the SLA, or
at least a large part of it.
Bruce Franklin, a fired Stanford
associate English professor who was on
the Venceremos Central Committee
throughout its existence, said the
theory "is getting- me pissed off.
People will go through the
goddamndest mental contortions I
ever heard to link the SLA and
Venceremos."
Franklin maintained an article
appearing in the May issue of the
Venceremos newspaper discussing
"spontaneous struggle" was not a
denunciation of individual violence.
"There's nothing wrong with
spontaneous struggle," Franklin told
the Daily. "The problem is that people
demand more of any organization tha
provides leadership."
'Self Criticism'
The article, which was labeled "Self
Criticism," dealt with the newspaper
itself, Franklin said. "It was talking
about the newspaper as an organ of
information. It was not providing a
scientific analysis of what these
struggles mean," he claimed.

publishing heiress who was kidnaped
on Feb. 4.
The SLA has demanded $6 million
worth of food for poor people before
negotiations for her return can begin.
California officials say they have
begun to trace an intricate web
between her kidnapers and a number
of other groups they regard as
extremely dangerous.
All the groups have one thing in
common: they operate throughout the
California state prison system. And it
was in the prisons that they first made
contact with the SLA, according to
the officials.
Unofficial Suspects
The two chief unofficial suspects
in the Hearst kidnaping are both
prison escapees: Donald DeFreeze, 30,

who slipped away from the California
Training Facility in Soledad, and
Thero M. Wheeler, 29, who left the
California Medical Facility in
Vacaville.
Inmates who did time with
DeFreeze have identified his voice as
the one on tapes from the SLA that
claims to be "Cinque" — the group's
"field marshal." DeFreeze is also a
leader of the Black Guerilla Family
(BGF), according to authorities.
The BGF, long an obscure prison
gang, gained prominence recently after
two inmates in the state prison at
Tracy were killed in what authorities
claim way a BGF "initiation rite."
Venceremos Member
Wheeler was once a member of
Venceremos, a Bay Area Maoist
revolutionary group which reportedly
disbanded last fall. While Wheeler was
imprisoned, a number of Venceremos
members wrote letters to the
California Adult Authority asking for
his parole.
Authorities do not believe that
Wheeler's participation in Venceremos
is a coincidence; they theorize that a
split in the group over the issue of

urban guerilla violence as a political
tool may have produced the SLA, or
at least a large part of it.
Bruce Franklin, a fired Stanford
associate English professor who was on
the Venceremos Central Committee
throughout its existence, said the
theory "is getting- me pissed off.
People will go through the
goddamndest mental contortions I
ever heard to link the SLA and
Venceremos."
Franklin maintained an article
appearing in the May issue of the
Venceremos newspaper discussing
"spontaneous struggle" was not a
denunciation of individual violence.
"There's nothing wrong with
spontaneous struggle," Franklin told
the Daily. "The problem is that people
demand more of any organization tha
provides leadership."
'Self Criticism'
The article, which was labeled "Self
Criticism," dealt with the newspaper
itself, Franklin said. "It was talking
about the newspaper as an organ of
information. It was not providing a
scientific analysis of what these
struggles mean," he claimed.

Law enforcement authorities do
not accept Franklin's explanation.
They insist that a split in the group
provided much of the impetus for the
formation of the SLA.
They are, however, checking a
report that Wheeler left the SLA after
the Foster killing and didn't
participate in the kidnaping.
Wheeler Meets DeFreeze
Even if they should find that
Wheeler did drop out of the SLA,
authorities say he was once a member.
They believe he met with DeFreeze
and other SLA members in the Black
Cultural Association at Vacaville while
they were both inmates there.
One radical-watcher advised the
Department of Corrections to "be
damn careful" of anyone who
participated in the Black Cultural
Association.
Officials claim that several other
prison gangs are also involved. The
Mexican Mafia and the New Family,
two feuding chicano gangs that extend
their operations outside of prison
walls, also hover on the periphery,
officials say. They think the two

members to the SLA.
SLA Denials
Despite SLA denials, these officials
also believe that the August 7 Guerilla
Movement, an organization that
threatened prison personnel last
summer in retribution for the death of
San Quentin inmate George Jackson
ov«r two years ago, is the same group
as the SLA.
Franklin told the Daily that official
fears about the nature of the SLA
were "a fantasy novel. They probably
get their material from the same place
E. Howard Hunt gets his fictional
stuff."
But many officials are now carrying
guns, fearing they could be marked for
SLA action. Some have even moved
their families and taken other more
severe precautionary actions. They
agree with the analysis of one veteran
observer of the radical scene.
"Look at them," he said. "They
[the SLA] haven't been able to get
any money or support for their people
[in San Quentin], no defense
committees or anything. No one
rallied to their side after they pulled
off what they thought was a big favor:
the Foster killing.
"They're desperate. They've got to
do something big to make an
impression. They will keep making one
big play after another until they get
their popular following."
California law enforcement
authorities believe that the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA),
the terrorist group that claims credit
for kidnaping Patricia Hearst, is
involved with several other radical
groups and prison gangs.

responsible for the murder of Oakland
School Superintendent Marcus Foster
