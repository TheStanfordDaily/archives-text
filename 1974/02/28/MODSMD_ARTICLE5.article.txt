# 'Thousands' Of Cats Prowl Quad
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
They only come out at night, when it's quiet and still.
One by one they slip from beneath the foundations of
buildings until hundreds, possibly thousands of them are
patrolling the deserted inner Quad. In the past two years,
these night visitors have even spread as far as Encina
Commons.
But when daylight comes, these four-legged wraiths
return to their lairs, slipping back into steam tunnels under
Geography Corner, or near President Richard Lyman's
office. Perhaps they might emerge briefly during the day to
see if any food has been put out for them, but seldom are
they seen by students going to and from classes.
These four-legged wraiths are Stanford's wild cat
population, as tricky to see and catch as any ghost, goblin
or leprechaun. According to Hal Wilson, University safety
and health specialist, cats have been living in the steam
tunnels since at least 1960, and now there must be
"thousands" of them.
According to several Stanford employees who have to
work in the steam tunnels, checking for breaks and other
problems, the wild cats have made their work downright
frightening on occasion.
Stories differ among workers who have been in the
tunnels, but all say that the cats have "attacked" them on
three or four occasions, with no serious physical injury but
plenty of mental anguish.
Cats Multiply
"The cats get cornered where a tunnel dead-ends,"
according to one maintenance person. "All of a sudden,
you hear this growling and snarling, and there's this wild
animal that'll do anything to get by you."
Over the last two years, the number of wild cats seems

to have undergone a dramatic increase. According to Wilson
and tunnel workers, many cat fanciers have left food for
these wild animals at various places around the Quad. A
sort of "feed and breed" situation has developed, so last
quarter, Wilson hired a student trapper to help thin out the
population.
"Poison was out of the question," Wilson said, so he
asked junior physics major John Levin to become a
full-time trapper for the last half of autumn quarter.
Claustrophobia
Even though Levin used the humane cage-type traps,
"philosophically, I don't like to trap animals," he said in
discussing his job.
Squeezing his 6-5 frame into the cramped tunnels, Levin
has managed to trap 11 cats, which the University
subsequently turned over to the Santa Clara County Animal
Shelter.
With cats' eyes staring from the end of a dark tunnel,
"it's definitely not a place for claustrophobia," Levin said.
"It would have been nice to be a foot and a half shorter.
Half the time the cats picked the triggers from the traps
without setting them off," he added.
Traps Fail
With the trapping less than 100 percent successful, direct
efforts to thin out the wild cat population have ended for
the time being, according to Jewell Goode, maintenance
program manager. Presently, maintenance crews are
concentrating on closing access holes near building
foundations, so the cats can't get in and out as easily.
Still, the wild cats of Stanford's steam tunnels have
survived both the turbulent 1960s and student trappers,
and remain the premiere inhabitants of Stanford's only real
underground.
