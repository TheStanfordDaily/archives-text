## Shockley Debate 
### 
Prof. William Shockley's on the road again, spreading the
message of "dysgenics" far and wide.
If he can get a podium, that is.
This week, Shockley was to debate Roy Innis, executive
director of the Congress of Racial Equality, at Queens
College. The debate was canceled.
Two weeks ago, a similar debate was canceled by the Yale
Political Union.
Last fall, Harvard University canceled its planned
Shockley-lnnis debate after protests from the Harvard Black
Law Students' Association.
The only notable invitation Prof. Shockley has not had
canceled out from under him was at Princeton last
December â€” and then, Innis refused to appear.
The spectacle of liberal universities outrunning one
another for the honor of inviting Prof. Shockley, then
canceling the invitation when objections were heard, is not a
pretty one.
We don't agree with most of Prof. Shockley's notions
about race and intelligence. We often find it difficult to
consider him a serious spokesman of genetic theory. And we
often wonder why anyone would invite him to speak at all.
But once invited, the man ought to be allowed to speak.
Academic freedom is too often honored in the breach
instead of the observance.
