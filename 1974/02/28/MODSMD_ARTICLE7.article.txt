Thank Taxpayers
Editor:
How unfortunate that Bertrand
Meyer, in his letter about the
Stanford Program in Paris (Daily,
Feb. 21), should have found it
necessary to mar well-deserved
praise of French generosity with
uncalled for aspersions on
American education.
"In most European countries,"
writes Meyer, "high education is
considered a right, rather than a
luxury involving many-digit
prices." If so, Europeans may be
well advised to convert their rights
into luxuries, considering that
practically every other citizen
enjoys the luxury of a college
education in the benighted United
States: out of every 1000
Americans, 750 graduate from
high school, and out of these, 432
go on to higher education. To
avoid embarrassing Meyer, I shall
simply say that the equivalent
proportions are very much smaller
in enlightened Europe where
education is "a right."
"Traditionally," Meyer
continues, "foreign students have
been welcome to share the same
privileges as French students —
provided they had the required
level of competence — at the
expense of French taxpayers. I
favor this liberalism." So do
Americans, inasmuch as Meyer's
statement applies, a une virgule
pres, to foreign students in
American colleges and
universities.
True, Mr. Meyer complains
about the higher costs of a
Stanford education. So do our
American students, and
understandably so. But the point
is that Stanford's high tuition
covers only 43 percent of the
actual costs, with the remaining
57 percent contributed directly or
indirectly by the American
taxpayer.
Whats more, in state colleges
and universities, where numerous
foreign students are equally
welcome, the American taxpayer
contributes more than 90 percent
of the costs.
Let me thank again the French
taxpayer for his generous support
of Stanford students in Paris;
perhaps Meyer will not find it
inappropriate to thank the
American taxpayer for supporting
his studies at Stanford.

Syphilis Study
Editor:
Hallelujah! Of 100 men in the
Tuskegee Syphilis Study, 33
received treatment "considered to

be adequate." I'd like to know
how the other 67 men feel about
Dr. Barnett's statement. How in
God's name could failure to get
treatment be "by their own
choice?"
They were known syphilis
patients and there was a known
medication. Where does the
medical profession's obligation to
patients begin? Do we have to go
in, diagnose our disease, and then
tell them what kind of treatment
we want? Whether Dr. Barnett
admits it or not his choice is
obvious, "further the cause of
science" at the expense of these
nameless black men.

Deserve Support
Editor:
As a member of the Stanford
Redvest Band, I had the
opportunity of traveling to
Corvallis and Eugene, Ore. this
past weekend. As a resident of
Los Angeles, I have seen many a
UCLA and USC basketball game. I
think I can safely say that
students from other schools enjoy
the Stanford Band (though it may
only be the Dollies they enjoy).
But what I would like to express
my thoughts about is that of vocal
support for our basketball game.
The yelling and cheering at the
University of Oregon hardly
stopped for a minute Saturday
night, and, although it got a bit
rowdy at times, I wondered if the
Stanford team had half that vocal
support, how many more games
would they win? I got the same
answer every time I thought about
it — quite a few.
Our teams deserve the support
of students. They work just as
hard as anyone else here
academically, plus they practice
long and hard hours developing
their athletic skills to a point of
near-perfection. Why don't we
give them the small things that we
can, such as a full house at
basketball games? Maples Pavilion
is the smallest of the Pac-8 gyms,
yet all seven others are sold out
continuously.
The band has to play the
William Tell Overture before the
fans will even clap audibly, and
then, it isn't even for the team (I
assume it's for the band). I can't
believe students here have better
things to do on Friday nights —
I've spent too many Friday nights
sitting around.
I hope that in the final three
games of the season, Stanford
students will do their best to show
their appreciation for the things
the Stanford basketball team has
done for them.
