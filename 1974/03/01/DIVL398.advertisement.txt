Dr. Moltmann s major book to date is I heologie der
Hoffnung, published in Germany in 1964. Appearing in
English translation three years later, Theology of Hope has
provided creative impetus for the contemporary theological "The Children of the Future"
movement of the same name. In his treatment of the
cschatological promise of the Bible, the significance of the Wednesday, March 6, 1974
resurrection in history, and the revolutionary mission of the 8:00 p.m.
church, Dr. Moltmann has contributed a fresh alternative to
neo-orthodox and existentialist theologies. He has also been
an active participant in ecumenical and Christian-Marxist
dialogue. In addition to Theology of Hope, his other books BISHOP AUDITORIUM
available in English translation are Religion, Revolution, and GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
the Future (1969), Hope and Planning (1971), Theology of STANFORD UNIVERSITY
Play (1972), and The Gospel of Liberation (1973).
