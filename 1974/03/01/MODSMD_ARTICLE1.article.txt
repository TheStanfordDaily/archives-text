# Labor Party Leads In British Election
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) â€” The Labor party
of former Prime Minister Harold
Wilson took a wide lead over the
Conservatives early today in Britain's
crisis election, bui not enough on the
basis of computer projections to
achieve a majority in the House of
Commons.
Projections by the British
Broadcasting Corp. and the
independent television network ITV
indicated the balance of power in the
new Parliament might win; up with
independents and the surging Liberal
party of Jeremy Thorpe.
When vote counting halted for the
night with 440 of the 635 election
districts tabulated, the Laborites had a
76-seat lead over Prime Minister
Edward Heath's Conservatives. One
Labor party leader expressed
confidence in a victory for Wilson, and
predicted that he would form a
government, even though it might be a

minority one.
The vote counting resumes late this
morning and the Conservatives could
pick up some strength in returns from
the normally pro-Tory rural areas.
Elizabeth Returning
Queen Elizabeth II was flying back
from a visit to Australia to be on hand
to name the prime minister. She is
bound by the constitution to invite
the leader of the strongest party in the
election to form the government.
But its life would depend on the
Liberals and the independents. Should
it fail, new elections could be in
prospect.
The BBC projection had Labor
taking 307 seats, the Conservatives of
Prime Minister Edward Heath 300
seats and the remaining 28 in the
hands of the Liberals and the
independents.
ITV projected 307 seats for Labor,
293 for the Conservatives, 22 for the
Liberals and 13 for other parties.
Actual Tabulations
In the actual tabulations with 440
election districts counted, the Labor
party had 253 seats, the Conservatives
177, the Liberals five and other parties
five.
Wilson served as prime minister
from 1964 to 1970 when he was
ousted in an upset victory by Heath.
Late returns showed the Laborites
had pulled in 40.9 percent of the
popular vote, and Conservatives 37.6
percent, Liberals 18.4 percent and the
other parties 3.1 percent.
Early Lead
The Labor party normally takes an
early lead as results from the cities
flow in. The tide of Conservative
successes begins running more strongly
when suburban and rural counts are
announced.
Heath, Wilson and Liberal party
chief Jeremy Thorpe all won
reelection to their Parliament seats
with no difficulty.
Heath called this election ahead of
time after coal miners decided to go
out on strike in the midst of an energy
crisis and rising inflation. His party
campaigned on the issue of who runs
the country, the elected government
or the unions.
A party needed 318 for a majority
in the House of Commons, and thus to
be able to form a government. The
leader of the winning party becomes
the prime minister.
About 40 million Britons were
eligible to vote. Headquarters of the
three major parties said about 75
percent of them or more turned out in
wintry weather: snow in Scotland,
pelting rains in Wales and a mixture of
raw winds, sleet and some sunshine in
England.
Irish Bombings
Election day in Northern Ireland, a
British province that sends a dozen
representatives to Parliament, saw a
sudden upsurge of bombings.
Police there said 12 bombs went off
in two hours and one man was
reported killed and a woman lost her
legs in Belfast, the provincial capital,
as the rivalry between the Protestant
majority and the Roman Catholic
minority took on electoral overtones.
