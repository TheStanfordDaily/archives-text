# George Wallace's Political Clout
##

Civil rights were long the tacit tenet of
Alabama politics, but it was not until 1958
that they became the central issue. It was in
that year that George Corley Wallace first ran
for the Alabama governorship.
Wallace's attitude toward the state's black
population was considered moderate — he
even received a glowing endorsement from
the NAACP. But his opponent, John
Patterson, was an unabashed segregationist
who courted and won the favor of the Ku
Klux Klan. In the end, it was the civil rights
issue that decided the outcome of the
election: ironically, Wallace's moderate
stance gave Patterson a narrow margin of
victory.
Though bitter over his loss, Wallace was
still objective enough to learn from his
mistakes. In the early morning hours of June
22, when the results were final and his defeat
apparent, Wallace gathered together his
closest friends and shared with them a
solemn vow: "John Patterson out-nigguhed
me. And boys, I'm not goin' to be
out-nigguhed again."
Gov. Wallace has not lost another
Alabama election since. More significantly,
he has managed to parlay his reactionary
stand on civil rights into a politically potent
national movement.
Political Clout
In 1968, his candidacy for the Presidency
turned a decisive election into a close one; in
1972, his withdrawal from the Presidential

race turned a close election into a "clear
mandate." Wallace's political clout forced the
Republicans to develop their "Southern
strategy"; neglect of Wallace's political clout
has badly splintered Democratic solidarity.
Today, though he is hopelessly crippled,
there is no evidence that George Wallace's
political power has diminished. Indeed, there
is significant evidence to the contrary. Two
Democratic Presidential hopefuls have been
courting both Wallace and his supporters:
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D—Mass., traveled to
Montgomery last July to appear with the
governor at Alabama's Independence Day
celebration; a few weeks ago Lloyd Bentsen,
Jr., D—Tex., called the Alabama governor
"an integral part of the bemocratic party . ..
which should not be ignored." The
Republicans too have been guilty of wooing
Wallace, as evidenced by President Nixon's
visit last week to the Alabama governor's
mansion.
George Wallace's power cannot be
accurately analyzed in terms of his style or
his substance, for his political mystique stems
from a subtle mixing of the two. With the
diction of a backwoods farmer and the
philosophy of a stolid Klansman, Wallace
appeals to a subterranean political
consciousness in America.
Not Hick Or Racist
He exists not as the hick or as the racist,
but as the embodiment of the "folks":
truckers, waitresses, department-store clerks,

and plant workers — suffering from racial,
economic, and intellectual alienation.
Operating on the most basic assumptions
about human nature (e.g., "Nigguhs hate
whites, and whites hate nigguhs. Everybody
knows that deep down."), he has managed to
crystallize America's discontents — rational
or irrational — around himself.
Whatever primeval political truths Wallace
has hit upon, they are significant. As he
himself once confided to a friend: "Let 'em
call me a racist. Whole heap of folks in this
country feel the same way I do. Race is
what's gonna win this thing for me."
Wallace A Demagogue
Wallace is essentially a prototype of the
demagogue. The fact that he can succeed in
American politics today is both surprising
and distressing. Wallace shows that even in
supposedly sophisticated society, it is still
possible to strip the thin veneer of reason
from politics, to reduce the electorate to a
biological common denominator, to appeal
to a broad cross-section of America on a
primitive and brutal level.
George Wallace is fortunately unique in
American politics, but he demonstrates how
political success can be built on our hatred,
anxieties, and dreams. And so long as "we are
creatures hung halfway between the mud and
the stars," demagogues like George Wallace
will enjoy limitless success.
