# Elect Goldstein To School Board
## 
### 
Chris Gray, Debbi Silton

The upcoming Board of Education
election this March provides an opportunity
for change at a time when many people feel
weak and powerless.
Although everyone knows how important
the educational system is in determining the
nature and quality of society, some students
seem to feel that they shouldn't vote because
they are not intimately involved with the
school system. It would be wise to remember
that Stanford University pays a major share
of the property taxes that finance the Palo
Alto Unified School District.
That money is a part of your costs paid
through tuition, room, and board. Two
elementary schools are serving the Stanford
community and many faculty members,
married students, and staff employees send
their children to Palo Alto schools. Students
pay taxes for the schools â€” certainly they
have every right to vote on who is going to
spend their money.
Turnout Six Percent
One seat on the Board of Education
comes up for election annually. Last year,
the turnout at the Wilbur Hall polling place

was a spectacular six percent. One excuse
given for the poor turnout was that there
weren't any decent candidates running.
Whether or not that was true at the time, the
same can not be said for this year.
There are two principal candidates
running for this year's seat on the Board of
Education: Joshua Goldstein and the
incumbent, Royce Cole. Cole ran against Pete
McCloskeytwo years ago for the Republican
Congressional nomination.
His platform was thatMcCloskey was not a
good Republican and specifically that he
didn't show enough loyalty to President
Nixon. Cole is using the same money/mass
media campaign as he used in his
unsuccessful campaign against McCloskey.
Serious Opposition
Joshua Goldstein is the only serious
opposition, especially after his endorsements
from the Palo Alto Federation of Teachers
and the Palo Alto Citizens' Caucus. Joshua,
21, is now a researcher on the staff of the
Institute of Political Studies.
He has lived all his life in Palo Alto and
was a teacher at the Child Care Center during

1972-73. Philosophically, Joshua believes
schools should seek to foster cooperation and
not competition.
Apart from their basic philosophies, there
are a number of specific issues on which
Joshua and Royce Cole disagree. The school
district owns some open land in the foothills
which the school board tried to sell last year
for housing developments. Joshua believes it
should be used for student projects in
biology and ecology.
Anyone interested in making comparisons
in other issues as well, such as declining
enrollment and student motivation, should
attend one of the candidates' nights held near
the urrpiK as noted in Ghee Amnd the Quad.
There is an excellent chance that Joshua
Goldsteinwill win. Obviously, the School
Board members have more than a little
influence on the type of education given.
Joshua's influence will make a real difference
on the Board and on the Palo Alto schools. A
clear choice is presented. Vote Tuesday,
March 5.
