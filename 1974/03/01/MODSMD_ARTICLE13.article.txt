# Gasoline, Bikes And Green Stamps

Some guy asked me the other day how
many feet I get to the gallon. Boy, that really
got to me.
After many long and frustrating hours of
sitting on the boat's starboard bow,
Columbus finally spotted land. Today in
1974, a comparable feat is to last through
until next month's fuel allotment period.
Many mornings I have stolen away from
my room, at 6 a.m. when it's darker than
African violets outside, just to wait in line
with 300 other motorists to fill my tank
one-eighth full with the five gallon maximum.
What bliss is a full tank!
I waited for two hours in my Spiderman
pajamas, French book in hand, eating a
bruised apple from the food service, for
gasoline the other day only to be told that
even numbered license plates were the only
ones being serviced.
Car, Not License
"But, sir, my license plate doesn't need

gas, it's my car, please, how am I going to get
back to school?" I pleaded with the
attendant.
I suppose Nixon was right when he
announced, "There will be no energy crunch
in 1974." He has a point: how can there be a
crisis of something nobody has?
I forget, do we drive at 68 m.p.h. and
keep our rooms at 55 degrees or the other
way around?
Have we been suckered! We sink $3000
into a car, and now it is still as useless as last
quarter's chem book! Do you know that a
$2500 Volkswagen that you bought in 1968,
has had over $13,000 invested in it if you
include taxes, gas, insurance, tires, oil, and
check-ups? It used to be that if you could
find a parking place, you quickly went out
and bought a car for it. Has anybody got one
gallon?
Bikes Don't Need Gas
Actually, we're pretty lucky, bikes don't

need gas. But then again, it's em harassing
taking a girl to a drive-in movie on a Schwinn
dpluxe.
The gas station people, the gas companies,
the Arabs, and Henry Kissinger are the only
people getting mileage out of the crisis. Ever
wonder how Henry does it?
Did anyone ever tell you that since 1967,
ethyl and regular have been the same? That's
right, no difference except for the price.
Save Stamps
I'm saving up my green and blue stamps
for a brand new needlepoint kit. I know just
where I'm going to use it. Or maybe I will sell
greeting cards or slinkies or yoyo's to
waiting customers. Where are the good ole
days when the air was clear, the water was
blue, and the bagels were round?
I'm moving to Gilligan's Island; there
somebody can understand me. Drive me to
the boat dock, huh?
