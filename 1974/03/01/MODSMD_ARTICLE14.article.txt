# Trident And Us

Lise Giraud

I bow with alacrity to Prof.
Daniel Bershader's superior
"military expertise relating to our
submarine-launched system"
(Daily letter, Feb. 25). After all,
according to the Stanford
Engineering School Directory for
1971-72, he was for five years a
panel member of the U.S. Navy
Bureau of Weapons Commission
on Aeroballistics and for at least
15 (from 1956 on) a senior
consulting scientist of the
Lockheed Space and Missile
Corp., the prime contractor and
financial beneficiary of the
Trident missile systems.
He also worked on a Navy
contract aimed at improving the
performance of solid propellant
rockets (SWOPSI Report, Volume
One). Prof. Bershader is thus
clearly a real expert and far closer
that I to the nitty-gritty of
weapons development.
In fact, were I not as simplistic
as he says I am, I might be
tempted to wonder if his intimate
connection with the Navy and
Lockheed had something to do
with the vehemence of his attack
on my letter.
Taxpayers' Money
In a democracy, however,
decisions should not be left
entirely to the experts who serve
institutions like Lockheed and the
Navy. The Trident project
concerns me. Among other
reasons, I am, together with other
taxpayers, being asked by Defense
Secretary Schlesinger to shell out
almost a quarter of a billion
dollars a day for military expenses
(Wall Street Journal, Feb. 6). I
have a certain frugal concern
about where that money goes.
Many people in Prof.
Bershader's position get their tax
money back — through DoD
contracts, consulting fees from
corporations funded by the
government, etc. — but most of us
are apt to take a less sanguine view
of staking the Navy to an eventual
fleet of 30 Tridents, each armed
with hundreds of nuclear
warheads with a range of up to
4000 miles, and each hundreds of
times more powerful than the
bomb that levelled Hiroshima.
One might not begrudge the
Navy the mere $50 billion this is
estimated to cost over the next
ten years (and we know what
happens to those modest
Lockheed estimates once they go
into production), if the Navy did
not already have a fleet of
Polaris-Poseidon submarines with
enough nuclear power to destroy
over a hundred major cities.
Good Guys, Bad Guys
As, in Prof. Bershader's words,
we good guys say to the bad guys,
this sort of thing is genocidal, and
for those of us who are not so
keen on frying our fellow men —
and women and children — this
seems a futile, if not dangerous,
way to keep the wheels turning in
the military-industrial complex.
Lockheed workers need their jobs,
but is there nothing more useful
for them to do than this
monstrous overkill boondoggle?
Bershader takes me to task for
"prejudicial political, racial and
socio-economic categorization,"
because I said Patricia Hearst (for
whose safety I too hope fervently)
is white and a member of the
ruling class. (What other race or
socio-economic category would
one put the Hearsts in?) He
upbraids me for condemning as
filthy deeds such things as U.S.
performed and /or supported
bombing in Asia and the work of
the CIA Coup Squad in Chile
(which he calls "our country's
foreign programs").
'Wild Emotionalism'
My use of the word "hysteria"
sent him scurrying to his Webster.
My Webster defines it as an
"outbreak of wild emotionalism,"
and I stand by that. Take
Bershader, for instance.
He himself rushes into print on
the Hearst case, though he never,
to my knowledge, wrote to
deplore the massive havoc
wrought by "our country's
foreign programs" nor the grisly
horror the Trident might unleash.
I think, Prof. Bershader, all you
did was prove my point.

filthy deeds such things as U.S.
performed and /or supported
bombing in Asia and the work of
the CIA Coup Squad in Chile
(which he calls "our country's
foreign programs").
'Wild Emotionalism'
My use of the word "hysteria"
sent him scurrying to his Webster.
My Webster defines it as an
"outbreak of wild emotionalism,"
and I stand by that. Take
Bershader, for instance.
He himself rushes into print on
the Hearst case, though he never,
to my knowledge, wrote to
deplore the massive havoc
wrought by "our country's
foreign programs" nor the grisly
horror the Trident might unleash.
I think, Prof. Bershader, all you
did was prove my point.

I bow with alacrity to Prof.
Daniel Bershader's superior
"military expertise relating to our
submarine-launched system"
(Daily letter, Feb. 25). After all,
according to the Stanford
Engineering School Directory for
1971-72, he was for five years a
panel member of the U.S. Navy
Bureau of Weapons Commission
on Aeroballistics and for at least
15 (from 1956 on) a senior
consulting scientist of the
Lockheed Space and Missile
Corp., the prime contractor and
financial beneficiary of the
Trident missile systems.
He also worked on a Navy
contract aimed at improving the
performance of solid propellant
rockets (SWOPSI Report, Volume
One). Prof. Bershader is thus
clearly a real expert and far closer
that I to the nitty-gritty of
weapons development.
In fact, were I not as simplistic
as he says I am, I might be
tempted to wonder if his intimate
connection with the Navy and
Lockheed had something to do
with the vehemence of his attack
on my letter.
Taxpayers' Money
In a democracy, however,
decisions should not be left
entirely to the experts who serve
institutions like Lockheed and the
Navy. The Trident project
concerns me. Among other
reasons, I am, together with other
taxpayers, being asked by Defense
Secretary Schlesinger to shell out
almost a quarter of a billion
dollars a day for military expenses
(Wall Street Journal, Feb. 6). I
have a certain frugal concern
about where that money goes.
Many people in Prof.
Bershader's position get their tax
money back — through DoD
contracts, consulting fees from
corporations funded by the
government, etc. — but most of us
are apt to take a less sanguine view
of staking the Navy to an eventual
fleet of 30 Tridents, each armed
with hundreds of nuclear
warheads with a range of up to
4000 miles, and each hundreds of
times more powerful than the
bomb that levelled Hiroshima.
One might not begrudge the
Navy the mere $50 billion this is
estimated to cost over the next
ten years (and we know what
happens to those modest
Lockheed estimates once they go
into production), if the Navy did
not already have a fleet of
Polaris-Poseidon submarines with
enough nuclear power to destroy
over a hundred major cities.
Good Guys, Bad Guys
As, in Prof. Bershader's words,
we good guys say to the bad guys,
this sort of thing is genocidal, and
for those of us who are not so
keen on frying our fellow men —
and women and children — this
seems a futile, if not dangerous,
way to keep the wheels turning in
the military-industrial complex.
Lockheed workers need their jobs,
but is there nothing more useful
for them to do than this
monstrous overkill boondoggle?
Bershader takes me to task for
"prejudicial political, racial and
socio-economic categorization,"
because I said Patricia Hearst (for
whose safety I too hope fervently)
is white and a member of the
ruling class. (What other race or
socio-economic category would
one put the Hearsts in?) He
upbraids me for condemning as
filthy deeds such things as U.S.
performed and /or supported
bombing in Asia and the work of
