# Satellite Aids Alaskan Health Care
## 
### 
Medical Center News Bureau
An experimental satellite communications
system has dramatically improved the delivery of
health care in 14 remote Alaskan villages and
should be expanded to other isolated areas in the
state, Stanford researchers reported recently.
The satellite service enables native health aides —
who have at most only 16 weeks of training, but
provide all the primary medical care in their
communities — to obtain needed daily consultation
from doctors at an Alaskan field hospital.
With telephone virtually non-existent in these
bush regions of central Alaska, the health aides
previously were forced to depend upon unreliable
high frequency radio contact to reach the doctors.
Because of interference from storms, mountain
ranges and atmospheric disturbances, such radio
contact is possible only 14 percent of the time.
To provide more dependable communication
and make expert consultation available to the
health aides and their patients, the National Library
of Medicine's Lister-Hill Center for Biomedical
Communications funded an experimental satellite
service that began in August of 1971.
Satellite communication is more reliable than
radio, since the signal is transmitted from one point

up to the satellite and back down to another point,
bypassing most interference.
The project utilizes a NASA satellite parked
22,300 miles above the equator, and small ground
stations located in each village. The system is
operated and maintained by the Indian Health
Service and the University of Alaska Geophysical
Institute at Fairbanks.
The Lister-Hill Center contracted with
researchers here to evaluate the project and propose
recommendations for the development of a
permanent system.
Two members of the Stanford research team —
Edwin Parker and Heather Hudson from the
University's Institute for Communication Research
— reported their findings in a recent issue of the
New England Journal of Medicine, a scientific
journal.
They found that the installation of satellite
radio in the native villages improved the frequency
of contact with Tanana Hospital (a 26-bed field
hospital staffed by three doctors) by over 500
percent. Perhaps more significantly, the number of
medical cases discussed with a doctor increased
nearly 400 percent.
