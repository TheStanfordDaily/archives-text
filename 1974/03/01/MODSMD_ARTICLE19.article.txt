# Highway Gas Warnings Misleading?
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Although the dwindling supply
of gasoline continues to cause
concern and even chaos in the
major cities of California, there is
still enough gas to drive between
northern and southern California
— at least there was over the
weekend of Washington's
Birthday.
The route — south on 101, east
on 152 and south again on
Interstate 5 — is frequently
traveled by Stanford students
from southern California.
Interstate 5 is one of the
longest and straightest roads in
California, making navigation only
a matter of holding the steering

wheel firmly. The scenery consists
of miles of flat farmland dotted
occasionally with a tractor, a cow
or a gas station.
One Positive Aspect
The only positive aspect of
gasoline worries is that they make
the trip more exciting.
Several weeks ago, the
American Automobile Association
recommended that drivers not
make the trip because the
availability of gas along Interstate
5 was unknown. This
recommendation was in reality

unwarranted.
Needless words of caution
appeared from other sources as
well. The desk officer for the Los
Banos Highway Patrol said there
would probably only be gas at
certain truck stops along
Interstate 5.
And near the junction of
Highways 152 and 156 is the first
visible warning of a possible
shortage. Outside an Exxon
station near Hollister is a sign
stating: "Limited Gas Supply
Next 175 Miles On Interstate 5."
This sign was not an accurate
description of the situation.
Unlimited Sales
While two Standard stations
along Interstate 5 were limiting
gas sales to 10 gallons per
customer, most other stations
allowed unlimited sales.
In fact, every station of the 14
checked from Santa Nella to
Grapevine along Interstate 5
complained of a decline in
business during recent weeks.

Most station managers blamed
the "slack off" in business on the
shortage of gas in the major cities.
'Scared To Travel'
Ed Greer, manager of the
Mobil station at the junction of
Highway 165 and Interstate 5,
said, "People can't get out of the
city, and even when they can,
they're scared to travel."
Greer also said, "If business
slacks off much more, we'll
probably go to a 'six to eight'
schedule every day."
Mauri Meadors, manager of the
Standard station at the junction
of Highway 119 and Interstate 5,
blamed the lack of customers on
the news media which were
"scaring the public off the roads."
