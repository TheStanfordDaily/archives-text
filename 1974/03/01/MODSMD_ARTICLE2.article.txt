# ASSU Flicks To Demand Stanford I.D.
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Employees of the Sunday Flicks
will require Stanford students, faculty,
and staff to produce identification
cards to buy 50 cent tickets under a
policy beginning Sunday.
Bob Sisson, manager of the Flicks,
says the new policy allows members of
the Stanford community to buy
tickets for 50 cents upon presentation
of ID. Others will be forced to pay $2
for a seat.
"For Stanford students, faculty,
staff, and their dependents, admission
will be 50 cents. All others will pay
$2. For people who hold season
passes, it will be as though nothing had
happened," Sisson declared.
Age restrictions have been
abolished, Sisson stated, because the
ages of persons responsible for recent
disruptions at the Flicks have varied.
"I'm concerned with some
non-Stanford students — some of them
over 18, some under 18 — who have
been creating disturbances, throwing
light bulbs into the crowds, for
example," Sisson declared.
"It's a hierarchy of who, I think,
the Flicks should serve. The students
are at the top . .. with faculty and
staff somewhere below that, with
others at the bottom," Sisson stated.
"[Going to the Flicks] is not going to
be such an incredibly good deal for
those not in the Stanford
community."
Flicks personnel will sell only one
ticket to each person who presents
identification, according to Sisson.
Employees will request presentation of
ID cards both for buying tickets and
for entering Memorial Auditorium, he
added.
"Some of the purpose [of the
increased price ] is to offset increased
security costs," Sisson declared.
"Another reason is to give priority to
members of the Stanford community
for a shortage of seats at the regular
showings."
Sisson says that disruptions at the
Flicks have included a physical assault
on one Flicks employee. The throwing
of light bulbs into the audience for
two consecutive weeks, caused Sisson
to call in outside police forces.
Sisson says he intends to continue
the use of student police at the Flicks,
but has not yet arranged for private
guards to attend this week's showing
of "Cries and Whispers."
The carding procedure will
continue for the rest of the quarter,
according to Sisson.
