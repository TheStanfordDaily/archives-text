# Leibert's Lively 'Misanthrope' Succeeds
## 
### ROBERT WESTON 
BERKELEY—It is no small
feat to bring Moliere to Berkeley;
The Misanthrope is stubbornly
irrelevant and affords not the
slightest chance for a nude scene.
Besides, the script is
appropriately in heroic couplet,
and who outside the Comedie
Francaise would dare to speak in
rhyme for two hours? And yet,
due primarily to an energetic cast
and skillful directing, the Berkeley
Repertory Theater under Michael
Leibert has done a commendable
job with the French classicist
comedy.
The production of The
Misanthrope is an unpretentious
success. It could be even more of
a success than it is, but what they
do they do well and with vigor.
The Misanthrope offers an
anatomy of hypocrisy and various
degrees of response to it. The
main character, Alceste, is a man
after Holden Caulfield's heart,
whose occupation, like
Shakespeare's Kent, is to be plain.
No Justice
He will not flatter, nor will he
employ any of the usual politic
means to influence a legal decision
concerning him. He will trust,
rather, to Justice to do him right,
though he is quick to point out
that there is no such thing in the
world of the court.
Alceste is unreasonably
attached to the queen of all the
phonies, Celimene, who delights
in the chit-chat of gossip and

backbiting.
His friend Philinte, who also
recognizes the vices of the age, is a
more reasonable fellow than
Alceste, and manages to temper
his honor enough to avoid
alienating himself from the world
in which he lives.
The central drama is in the
conflict between the fanatically
"honest" Alceste and the
vice-ridden, superficial,
hypocritical world in which he
lives, and, to his chagrin, loves.
There is a good deal of funny,
satirical wit throughout of the
sort found in the English comedy
of manners, but the play has its
more serious implications.
Correct Reading
The Misanthrope has been
thought by some to be overridden
by bitterness. Such, however, is
not the tone of Michael Leibert's
production, and in genera! his
reading of the play is correct. It is
certainly fun.
The best part of this
production is the dynamic use of
stage space. The only stage props
are a red divan and a couple of red
cushions, and yet there is not an
empty space in the performance.
Actors move rapidly in and out
of various areas to establish a
variety of relationships with each
other and with the audience.
There are moments which are
almost dizzying, but the action is
well directed and there is never a
slip.
The intimacy of the theater is

also put to good use, and a
pleasant rapport is quickly
established.
Young Cast
The cast, which is rather young
and very effectively costumed in a
mod style, does an excellent job
with the characters.
Especially effective are the
three rival suitors, Oronte, Acaste
and Clitandre, and Dußois,
Alceste's "man," who provides a
fine moment of burlesque in the
traditional French manner. The
gum-chewing, hot-panted maid
Basque is amusing, but used a bit
injudiciously.
The major roles of Alceste,
Celimene and Philinte, played by
Richard Marion, Ruth Silveira and
Paul Laramore, are admirably
done. Yet because of certain
misinterpretations of Alceste and
Philinte, the play fails to have
quite the impact could and
should.
Philinte's counsels of
moderation and compromise to
Alceste and his entirely moderate
love for the rather bland Eliante
are probably Moliere's
touchstones for a reasonable

adjustment to a world dominated
by insincerity and affectation.
Falls Flat
Had Philinte been played with
more sincerity and less worldliness
it would have been unnecessary to
undercut Alceste so drastically as
to have him fall flat on his face on
his final exit, for while Moliere no
doubt did not share Alceste's
extreme misanthropy, he
undoubtedly took it seriously.
The ending of the play is
subtle. The idealistic and
uncompromising Alceste chooses
solitary exile because his lover
Celimene, though willing to
reform, refuses to give up the rest
of the world for him alone.

Alceste is ridiculous, and so he
is shown to be; but the silent
presence of Philinte and Eliante,
who have accepted the follies and
vices of men and have decided in
spite of them that love is possible,
do more to expose Alceste's own
folly than any interpolated stage
business could.
But these are matters of some
debate, and the interpretation
presented in the Berkeley
Repertory's production is
certainly possible and is
vigorously sustained. However,
while everything else is so well
accounted for the play could be
even better than it is with a slight
interpretive adjustment.

sort found in the English comedy
of manners, but the play has its
more serious implications.
Correct Reading
The Misanthrope has been
thought by some to be overridden
by bitterness. Such, however, is
not the tone of Michael Leibert's
production, and in genera! his
reading of the play is correct. It is
certainly fun.
The best part of this
production is the dynamic use of
stage space. The only stage props
are a red divan and a couple of red
cushions, and yet there is not an
empty space in the performance.
Actors move rapidly in and out
of various areas to establish a
variety of relationships with each
other and with the audience.
There are moments which are
almost dizzying, but the action is
well directed and there is never a
slip.
The intimacy of the theater is

also put to good use, and a
pleasant rapport is quickly
established.
Young Cast
The cast, which is rather young
and very effectively costumed in a
mod style, does an excellent job
with the characters.
Especially effective are the
three rival suitors, Oronte, Acaste
and Clitandre, and Dußois,
Alceste's "man," who provides a
fine moment of burlesque in the
traditional French manner. The
gum-chewing, hot-panted maid
Basque is amusing, but used a bit
injudiciously.
The major roles of Alceste,
Celimene and Philinte, played by
Richard Marion, Ruth Silveira and
Paul Laramore, are admirably
done. Yet because of certain
misinterpretations of Alceste and
Philinte, the play fails to have
quite the impact could and
should.
Philinte's counsels of
moderation and compromise to
Alceste and his entirely moderate
love for the rather bland Eliante
are probably Moliere's
touchstones for a reasonable

adjustment to a world dominated
by insincerity and affectation.
Falls Flat
Had Philinte been played with
more sincerity and less worldliness
it would have been unnecessary to
undercut Alceste so drastically as
to have him fall flat on his face on
his final exit, for while Moliere no
doubt did not share Alceste's
extreme misanthropy, he
undoubtedly took it seriously.
The ending of the play is
subtle. The idealistic and
uncompromising Alceste chooses
solitary exile because his lover
Celimene, though willing to
reform, refuses to give up the rest
of the world for him alone.

Alceste is ridiculous, and so he
is shown to be; but the silent
presence of Philinte and Eliante,
who have accepted the follies and
vices of men and have decided in
spite of them that love is possible,
do more to expose Alceste's own
folly than any interpolated stage
business could.
But these are matters of some
debate, and the interpretation
presented in the Berkeley
Repertory's production is
certainly possible and is
vigorously sustained. However,
while everything else is so well
accounted for the play could be
even better than it is with a slight
interpretive adjustment.
BERKELEY—It is no small
feat to bring Moliere to Berkeley;
The Misanthrope is stubbornly
irrelevant and affords not the
slightest chance for a nude scene.
Besides, the script is
appropriately in heroic couplet,
and who outside the Comedie
Francaise would dare to speak in
rhyme for two hours? And yet,
due primarily to an energetic cast
and skillful directing, the Berkeley
Repertory Theater under Michael
Leibert has done a commendable
job with the French classicist
comedy.
The production of The
Misanthrope is an unpretentious
success. It could be even more of
a success than it is, but what they
do they do well and with vigor.
The Misanthrope offers an
anatomy of hypocrisy and various
degrees of response to it. The
main character, Alceste, is a man
after Holden Caulfield's heart,
whose occupation, like
Shakespeare's Kent, is to be plain.
No Justice
He will not flatter, nor will he
employ any of the usual politic
means to influence a legal decision
concerning him. He will trust,
rather, to Justice to do him right,
though he is quick to point out
that there is no such thing in the
world of the court.
Alceste is unreasonably
attached to the queen of all the
phonies, Celimene, who delights
in the chit-chat of gossip and

backbiting.
His friend Philinte, who also
recognizes the vices of the age, is a
more reasonable fellow than
Alceste, and manages to temper
his honor enough to avoid
alienating himself from the world
in which he lives.
The central drama is in the
conflict between the fanatically
"honest" Alceste and the
vice-ridden, superficial,
hypocritical world in which he
lives, and, to his chagrin, loves.

Falls Flat
Had Philinte been played with
more sincerity and less worldliness
it would have been unnecessary to
undercut Alceste so drastically as
to have him fall flat on his face on
his final exit, for while Moliere no
doubt did not share Alceste's
extreme misanthropy, he
undoubtedly took it seriously.
The ending of the play is
subtle. The idealistic and
uncompromising Alceste chooses
solitary exile because his lover
Celimene, though willing to
reform, refuses to give up the rest
of the world for him alone.

Alceste is ridiculous, and so he
is shown to be; but the silent
presence of Philinte and Eliante,
who have accepted the follies and
vices of men and have decided in
spite of them that love is possible,
do more to expose Alceste's own
folly than any interpolated stage
business could.
But these are matters of some
debate, and the interpretation
presented in the Berkeley
Repertory's production is
certainly possible and is
vigorously sustained. However,
while everything else is so well
accounted for the play could be
even better than it is with a slight
interpretive adjustment.
BERKELEY—It is no small
feat to bring Moliere to Berkeley;
The Misanthrope is stubbornly
irrelevant and affords not the
slightest chance for a nude scene.
Besides, the script is
appropriately in heroic couplet,
and who outside the Comedie
Francaise would dare to speak in
rhyme for two hours? And yet,
due primarily to an energetic cast
and skillful directing, the Berkeley
Repertory Theater under Michael
Leibert has done a commendable
job with the French classicist
comedy.
The production of The
Misanthrope is an unpretentious
success. It could be even more of
a success than it is, but what they
do they do well and with vigor.
The Misanthrope offers an
anatomy of hypocrisy and various
degrees of response to it. The
main character, Alceste, is a man
after Holden Caulfield's heart,
whose occupation, like
Shakespeare's Kent, is to be plain.
No Justice
He will not flatter, nor will he
employ any of the usual politic
means to influence a legal decision
concerning him. He will trust,
rather, to Justice to do him right,
though he is quick to point out
that there is no such thing in the
world of the court.
Alceste is unreasonably
attached to the queen of all the
phonies, Celimene, who delights
in the chit-chat of gossip and

backbiting.
His friend Philinte, who also
recognizes the vices of the age, is a
more reasonable fellow than
Alceste, and manages to temper
his honor enough to avoid
alienating himself from the world
in which he lives.
The central drama is in the
conflict between the fanatically
"honest" Alceste and the
vice-ridden, superficial,
hypocritical world in which he
lives, and, to his chagrin, loves.
There is a good deal of funny,
satirical wit throughout of the
sort found in the English comedy
of manners, but the play has its
more serious implications.
Correct Reading
The Misanthrope has been
thought by some to be overridden
by bitterness. Such, however, is
not the tone of Michael Leibert's
production, and in genera! his
reading of the play is correct. It is
certainly fun.
The best part of this
production is the dynamic use of
stage space. The only stage props
are a red divan and a couple of red
cushions, and yet there is not an
empty space in the performance.
Actors move rapidly in and out
of various areas to establish a
variety of relationships with each
other and with the audience.
There are moments which are
almost dizzying, but the action is
well directed and there is never a
slip.
The intimacy of the theater is

also put to good use, and a
pleasant rapport is quickly
established.
Young Cast
The cast, which is rather young
and very effectively costumed in a
mod style, does an excellent job
with the characters.
Especially effective are the
three rival suitors, Oronte, Acaste
and Clitandre, and Dußois,
Alceste's "man," who provides a
fine moment of burlesque in the
traditional French manner. The
gum-chewing, hot-panted maid
Basque is amusing, but used a bit
injudiciously.
The major roles of Alceste,
Celimene and Philinte, played by
Richard Marion, Ruth Silveira and
Paul Laramore, are admirably
done. Yet because of certain
misinterpretations of Alceste and
Philinte, the play fails to have
quite the impact could and
should.
Philinte's counsels of
moderation and compromise to
Alceste and his entirely moderate
love for the rather bland Eliante
are probably Moliere's
touchstones for a reasonable

adjustment to a world dominated
by insincerity and affectation.
