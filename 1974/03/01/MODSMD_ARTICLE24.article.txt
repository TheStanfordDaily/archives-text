# Rahsaan Roland Kirk Plays 'Miracle' Sax

### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO — Jazz saxophonist extraordinaire Rahsaan
Roland Kirk and his Vibration Society ended a two week stint at
Keystone Korner Sunday night.
On Thursday night the packed house had to wait until 10 for Kirk
to begin, introducing himself as "one of the miracles of the tenor
saxophone," and his music (jazz) as "Black classical music."
His regular quintet — Kenny Rogers, baritone sax; Matathias
Pearson, bass; Hilton Ruiz, piano; John Goldsmith, drums; and Kirk —
was augmented by the Bay Area's own Woody Shaw on trumpet, and
Keystone's owner, Todd Barkan, on percussion.
Starting with "Wow, Look At Those Beautiful Black Indians," the
blind tenor virtuoso quickly displayed that while he is not necessarily
a "miracle," he is one of the best jazz saxmen working today — the
"best" including two dozen or so others, the likes of Sonny Rollins,
Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, and Stanley Turrentine.
The best number of the set was "Man That Cried Five," a 12-bar,
5/4 tune reminiscent of the late John Coltrane, especially in Ruiz'
piano work, sounding quite a bit like McCoy Tyner.
Trumpeter Shaw also offered some tasteful licks on this, and every
other song as well.
The only low spot of the set came when it was time for Kirk to
"verbalize" a sort of second rate blues entitled "Baby, Let Me Hang
Out In Your Tree." On this tune, Kirk played a flute with a
harmonica taped to the mouthpiece.
Two standards were also included; "If I Love You" and Ellington's
"Satin Doll." On both selections Kirk played multiple reeds — tenor
and soprano, then tenor, soprano, and alto.
Unlike most reed men who sometimes play more than one sax
simultaneeously, in parallel harmonies, Kirk would play lead on one
and riff on the other, or at times play two totally separated leads,
simultaneously.
It was more than just a gimmick.
