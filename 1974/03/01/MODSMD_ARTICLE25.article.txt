# Drama Chairman Lyons:
## New Actors Sought 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"It's hard to make that first
audition," sympathizes Professor
Charles R. Lyons, chairman of the
Drama Department.
As chairman, Lyons is leading a
move by the Drama Department
to encourage undergraduate
participation in campus
productions.
"We have plenty of room for
people who aren't John Geilgud
or Diana Rigg," emphasizes
Lyons. "We would like to have
people major in drama, but that's
not crucial."
In particular, the department is
seeking undergraduates to
audition Monday and Tuesday,
March 5 and 6, for the upcoming
production of Tom Stoppard's
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead.
Tryouts will be held from 7 to
10 p.m. in Room 205, Memorial
Hall.
'Very Successful'
According to Lyons, the casts
of this year's first two main
season productions, Puntila and
His Hired Hand and The
Alchemist, included between 85
and 90 percent undergraduates.
Lyons termed both productions
"very successful."
Lyons feels that in the past
emphasis placed by the
department on its Master of Fine
Arts program may have driven
undergraduates away.
"Many of us regretted that,"
states Lyons.
However, the exclusion of
undergraduates from regular
department productions may have
had the positive effect of forcing
the founding of such independent
campus theatrical groups as The
Company and the Stanford
Savoyards.
"Stanford is very theater
oriented," states Lyons. "I like
the idea of groups performing all
over campus. We don't in any way
want to discourage that."
Graduate Workshop
In addition to main season

productions, Lyons urges
undergraduates to audition for
plays produced by the Graduate
Directing Workshop. Workshop
plays offer a chance for graduates
to direct, while giving students a
chance to participate in
productions which require less
time than the six weeks necessary
for a main production.
"It isn't a question of working
with second rate directors,"
explains Lyons.
The Graduate Directing
Workshop produces
approximately eight shows per
quarter, with an average time in
production of only three weeks.
Performances are usually given in
The Nitery.
"There are a variety of ways to
participate in University theater,
with a variety of time
commitments," Lyons states.
"We'd really like to know if
people want to work," says
Lyons, explaining that students
who can't get to a specific
audition or who can't work during
a particular quarter should
contact the Drama Department
anyway.
'Joyful Activity'
"We do have a great time,"
Lyons says of the department.
"We are committed to the idea of
theater as a joyful activity."
In order to bring dramatic
productions to more students, the
department has cut all student
admission prices to one dollar.
Even though most main drama

performances sell out, Lyons
explains that, "We're still tied to
the box office in terms of
production.
"I'd like to knock it [the
student admission price] down to
50 cents."
Although it isn't necessary for
a student to major in drama,
Lyons states, "We would like to
have people who can stay with us
a long time."
Recent Expansions
While the undergraduate drama
major may have been restrictive in
the past, recent expansions have
pushed the number of freshman
acting sections from seven to 12.
Majors can take a seven quarter
sequence of acting courses, as well
as one year of movement and one
year of vocal training for the
stage.
The final production of this
season will be the Mozart opera
Don Giovanni which will be
produced in cooperation with the
Music Department. Retiring Prof.
Sandor Salgo will be the musical
director for the ambitious
undertaking.
Lyons credits the academic
atmosphere of the University for
the excellence of the drama
department and its ability to
attempt works such as Don
Giovanni.
'The actors are acutely
intelligent," explains Lyons, "and
you can really do a lot with
intelligent actors."
