# Charlie Musselwhite To Play Blues History
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Blues harpist Charlie Musselwhite's story is not unlike that of any
other blues musician:
Born in Mississippi, raised in Tennessee; moved to Chicago at the
age of 18, in search of better wages; became well-known on the blues
scene, jamming with nearly every major figure in Chicago blues; later
moved to the West Coast.
But what makes Musselwhite's case a bit more unusual is that he is
white, just turned 30.
While the blues market has continually been the proving ground for
many whites — Paul Butterfield, Elvin Bishop, Steve Miller, Johnny
Winter, John Mayall — Musselwhite is perhaps the only one who has
never deviated from pure, stone blues. His consistency is somewhat
remarkable.
"Memphis Charlie" first learned the blues while still in Memphis,
from men like Furry Lewis, Gus Cannon, and Will "Son Brimmer"
Shade. He played both harmonica and slide guitar.
In 1962, he moved to Chicago in hopes of a better job —
unconsciously mimmicking the life pattern of most Mississippi
bluesmen.
He soon began playing harp in guitarist-mandolinist Johnny
Young's band, and became well-acquainted with people like Sonny
Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, and Walter "Shakey" Horton.
His first recording session produced "Stand Back! Here Comes
Charley Musselwhite's South Side Band," with Harvey Mandel on
guitar and Barry Goldberg on piano.
Although the LP sold fairly well (and continues to do so),
Musselwhite's earnings for the session came to exactly 38 cents.
As Musselwhite likes to say, 'There are a lot of harp blowers, but
there are only a very few harp players." Musselwhite is definitely
among the best of the few.
As for the blues, Musselwhite says,"I can't feel right about doing
something I don't believe in. I just try to be honest with myself." This
feeling is reflected in his music.
