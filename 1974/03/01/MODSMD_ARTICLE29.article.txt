# Hope To Snap Loss Streak
## Cards Host Trojan Ruggers 
### CHRIS BAKER 
There won't be 68,000 fans on
hand tomorrow for the
Stanford-USC rugby game, nor
will a "wispy little Indonesian"
kicker boot a last-minute penalty
kick, ending the Cards hopes for a
Monterey Tournament berth. And
that white-haired Irish gentleman
won't be on hand to add his
comments.
Instead it will probably be a
day of beer drinking and
comradarie between the two
schools, as most fans await the
evening basketball game between
Stanford and UCLA. But first
there is a rugby game to be played
at Harry Maloney Field.

Stanford, with a three-game
losing streak, will be trying to get
on the right track with a victory
against the 5-2 Men of Troy.
Comparative Scores
Although USC coach John
Petrill says "It's very difficult to
draw parallels when you compare
scores against common
opponents," the game of
comparative scores can sometimes
be helpful. UCLA beat both
teams, defeating the Trojans 23-6
and the Cards 13-4.
USC plays a very similar game
to UCLA. "I think we run more
set offensive plays than any team
except UCLA," said Petrill. "We
like to run and carry." This

offensive style should make for a
very fast game.
Rugby at USC has undergone a
lot of changes this year. It has lost
its club status and Troy has taken
a new attitude towards rugby,
according to Petrill, who played
two years for USC before
assuming the coaching post.
"Having played against Stanford, I
know that they are always a good
side," Petrill said. "Stanford
always gives us a great game."
Top Scorer
USC's leading scorer is Robert
Erickson, who has scored six tries
this year. Petrill praised backs
Dave Boulware, Jay Blackstock
and scrum half John Svidershi.
Ron Guess, "an American style
kicker with good range,"
according to Petrill, handles the
penalty kicking chores for Troy.
The Cards won't be looking
ahead to the Monterey Rugby
tourney tomorrow — at least
according to coach Pete
Kmetovic, "These last games are
very important to us. |The Cards
travel to Berkeley next Saturday
for their final regular season
game.] We've got to get the
offensive spark that's been missing
for the last couple of games."
Stanford has not been "finalizing
that scoring pass," Kmetovic says.
Stanford will be at full strength
tomorrow, with Gordy Riegel and
John Snider recovered from
injuries which have limited their
practice time the past couple of
weeks.

evening basketball game between
Stanford and UCLA. But first
there is a rugby game to be played
at Harry Maloney Field.

Stanford, with a three-game
losing streak, will be trying to get
on the right track with a victory
against the 5-2 Men of Troy.
Comparative Scores
Although USC coach John
Petrill says "It's very difficult to
draw parallels when you compare
scores against common
opponents," the game of
comparative scores can sometimes
be helpful. UCLA beat both
teams, defeating the Trojans 23-6
and the Cards 13-4.
USC plays a very similar game
to UCLA. "I think we run more
set offensive plays than any team
except UCLA," said Petrill. "We
like to run and carry." This

offensive style should make for a
very fast game.
Rugby at USC has undergone a
lot of changes this year. It has lost
its club status and Troy has taken
a new attitude towards rugby,
according to Petrill, who played
two years for USC before
assuming the coaching post.
"Having played against Stanford, I
know that they are always a good
side," Petrill said. "Stanford
always gives us a great game."
Top Scorer
USC's leading scorer is Robert
Erickson, who has scored six tries
this year. Petrill praised backs
Dave Boulware, Jay Blackstock
and scrum half John Svidershi.
Ron Guess, "an American style
kicker with good range,"
according to Petrill, handles the
penalty kicking chores for Troy.
The Cards won't be looking
ahead to the Monterey Rugby
tourney tomorrow — at least
according to coach Pete
Kmetovic, "These last games are
very important to us. |The Cards
travel to Berkeley next Saturday
for their final regular season
game.] We've got to get the
offensive spark that's been missing
for the last couple of games."
Stanford has not been "finalizing
that scoring pass," Kmetovic says.
Stanford will be at full strength
tomorrow, with Gordy Riegel and
John Snider recovered from
injuries which have limited their
practice time the past couple of
weeks.
There won't be 68,000 fans on
hand tomorrow for the
Stanford-USC rugby game, nor
will a "wispy little Indonesian"
kicker boot a last-minute penalty
kick, ending the Cards hopes for a
Monterey Tournament berth. And
that white-haired Irish gentleman
won't be on hand to add his
comments.
Instead it will probably be a
day of beer drinking and
comradarie between the two
schools, as most fans await the
evening basketball game between
Stanford and UCLA. But first
