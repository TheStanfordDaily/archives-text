# Mineta Defines Issues Of Minority Politics
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
San Jose Mayor Norman Mineta, a
candidate for Congress on his home
turf, spoke informally in the Junipero
lounge last night on some of the
difficulties he has faced as chief
executive of his city, the largest in the
country with an Asian-American
mayor.
"Since majority acceptance of
minority groups seems to go in an
inverse relationship to the darkness of
their skin, we Asians have always been
an 'acceptable minority.' "
commented the Democratic contender
in the 13th Congressional district
which includes part of Santa Clara
County.
"When I do something right,
though, it's expected of me as mayor
of San Jose; but when I screw up, it's
always 'that dumb Jap.' This is one
thing that grates the hell out of me,"
continued Mineta.
"My personal failures should not
have to reflect on the
Japanese-American community, but I
realize that I'm essentially in a
fishbowl, exposed to everyone."
Speaking before a small group of
predominantly Asian-American
students, Mineta emphasized his
contributions to minority-group affairs
in San Jose. "Since I was the first
non-white member of the city
council, I have been especially
interested in the affairs of other
groups, particularly the chicanos, who
constitute 18 percent of San Jose.
When I became mayor, I saw that
there was no way a chicano could get
elected to the city council, so I
appointed one to fill my old seat. Two

years later he held his seat in the
election."
Mineta stated that he relied heavily
on minorities in his election plans, and
that he had received almost 40 percent
of the contributions for his first
mayoral campaign from the local
Japanese-American community.
"If I accepted contributions of the
same size from building-trades
organizations, they'd almost surely be
back a year later holding out their
hats. The main thing that
Japanese-Americans can gain from me
is a matter of public image," Mineta
said.
