# Stanford Stars Await 'Friendly' Match Golf
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Conrad Nilmeier and Dave
Baskins, who have fought fiercely
for 50 cents countless times on
the Stanford course, expect a
mellower match tomorrow when
they square off in the first round
of the San Francisco City golf
tournament at Harding Park.
Both golfers were unhappy
with the tournament draw, but
accepted the unlucky pairing and
then expressed genuine praise for
each other.
"Dave's game is as sound as his
morals," said Nilmeier.
Baskins returned the
compliment, saying that "a lot of
people knock Conrad, but he's a
real sweet guy with a real sweet
golf swing."
Both of those statements were
made with tongues firmly in
cheek, so don't worry — the two
Stanford juniors won't be holding
hands on the first tee. But they
will find it hard to maintain their
competitive edges.
"The hardest part of the match
is knowing that if I win, I'll be
beating a good friend," Baskins
said. "I'm sure Conrad agrees that
it will be hard to keep the 'killer
instinct' needed in match play."
Both golfers advanced to
match play in last weekend's
36-hole qualifying at Harding and
Lincoln Parks. Baskins shot 149,
Nilmeier fired 152 and a third
Stanford player, George Pettinger,
qualified with a 151 total.
Pettinger will face John

Enright in tomorrow's first round.
Opening round winners square off
Sunday, reducing the original
match play field of 64 to 16 by
the end of the weekend. The
eventual champion must survive
two more weekends of match
play.
Today, the Stanford varsity —
including Baskins, Nilmeier and
Pettinger — will compete in the
eight-team Cal State-Hayward
Invitational at Silverado Country
Club in Napa. The tournament
will be contested over 36 holes in
one day, with 18 holes on each of
the two Silverado courses.
The Cards, who tied San Jose
State for the team title last year,
are favored to win the
championship outright in 1974.
The Spartans are not entered this
year.

Chip Shots: Baskins will warm
up for tomorrow's friendly match
with another friendly encounter
today. One of the entrants in the
Hayward tournament is Rich
Baskins, Dave's younger brother
and a top player for Nevada-Reno
. . . . Stanford's current
competitive averages are: Aly
Trompas (71.8), Baskins (73.2),
Pettinger (73.4), Nilmeier (73.8),
Brent Murray (76.75), Glenn
Goethels (79.0) and Tom Mason
(81.0) .... The freshman team
plays two matches this coming
week, hosting St. Francis High
School on Tuesday and Menlo
College Thursday.

they square off in the first round
of the San Francisco City golf
tournament at Harding Park.
Both golfers were unhappy
with the tournament draw, but
accepted the unlucky pairing and
then expressed genuine praise for
each other.
"Dave's game is as sound as his
morals," said Nilmeier.
Baskins returned the
compliment, saying that "a lot of
people knock Conrad, but he's a
real sweet guy with a real sweet
golf swing."
Both of those statements were
made with tongues firmly in
cheek, so don't worry — the two
Stanford juniors won't be holding
hands on the first tee. But they
will find it hard to maintain their
competitive edges.
"The hardest part of the match
is knowing that if I win, I'll be
beating a good friend," Baskins
said. "I'm sure Conrad agrees that
it will be hard to keep the 'killer
instinct' needed in match play."
Both golfers advanced to
match play in last weekend's
36-hole qualifying at Harding and
Lincoln Parks. Baskins shot 149,
Nilmeier fired 152 and a third
Stanford player, George Pettinger,
qualified with a 151 total.
Pettinger will face John

Enright in tomorrow's first round.
Opening round winners square off
Sunday, reducing the original
match play field of 64 to 16 by
the end of the weekend. The
eventual champion must survive
two more weekends of match
play.
Today, the Stanford varsity —
including Baskins, Nilmeier and
Pettinger — will compete in the
eight-team Cal State-Hayward
Invitational at Silverado Country
Club in Napa. The tournament
will be contested over 36 holes in
one day, with 18 holes on each of
the two Silverado courses.
The Cards, who tied San Jose
State for the team title last year,
are favored to win the
championship outright in 1974.
The Spartans are not entered this
year.

up for tomorrow's friendly match
with another friendly encounter

Conrad Nilmeier and Dave
Baskins, who have fought fiercely
for 50 cents countless times on
the Stanford course, expect a
mellower match tomorrow when
