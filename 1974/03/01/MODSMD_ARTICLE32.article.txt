# Baseball Puzzle Fitting Together
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Stanford's baseball season has
been like a jigsaw puzzle. One
spends hours and hours staring at
the scattered pieces trying to find
the right pieces for the right
places. If you'll pardon the
analogy, the pieces are starting to
fall in place for the Cardinals.
The Cards, who edged Sail Jose
State Tuesday 3-2, will meet
Santa Clara University today at
2:30 p.m. in Buck Shaw Stadium.
Tomorrow, Stanford hosts Fresno
State in a 12 noon doubleheader
at Sunken Diamond.
"We're looking for the point
where everything will fall into
place," said Cardinal coach Ray
Young. "We still have to improve
to get things done."
Tuesday's win over SJS has
been long in coming for the
Cardinals, who had been
wallowing in the doldrums of a
six-game losing streak.
Just when the Cards were
getting good pitching, the
Stanford bats turned cold —
almost as cold as the weather
which was wet at times. The game
had to be delayed 10 minutes
because of rain during the third
inning.
Frost Stars
"It's one of those things, the
pitching comes then the hitting
gets lax," said Young. "Dave
[Frost] pitched a good game. He
had almost as much velocity at
the end as he did at the
beginning."
Frost limited SJS to five hits in
going the distance to even his
record at 1-1 this year. Frost's
career mark is now 11-1.
The Cards have had five
one-run decisions this year,
including the last three games.
"We're not afraid to win or lose. I
don't think the ball club has done
that [given up| this year."
Stanford's style of play has
been noteworthy on the field, at
the plate and on the bases. And,
now the pitching seems to be
coming around.
"This ball club has the best
competitive attitude I've seen in
nine years," said team statistician
John Q. Wright.
The Cards showed their
scrappiness in the late innings
Tuesday by pulling out runs in the
eighth and ninth to overcome the
Spartans.
Good Omen
After the fifth the Cards were
behind 2-1, when Wright
remarked, "it may be a good
omen that we're behind." Five of
the games the Cards have lost this
year were when Stanford was
ahead after the first five innings.
Sophomore right-hander Ken
Grolle, who pitched on the varsity
last year before coming up with a
bad shoulder, has been working
out in practice. "They're
experimenting with Ken's
shoulder, taping it up so he can't
raise his arm to the point where it
hurts," said Young. "We may use
him in the Riverside Tournament
if he's ready. We're not going to
use him if there is any chance of
hurting him."
Another possibility to bolster
the Card pitching staff is

outfielder Bob Hampton, who has
volunteered to pitch.
"Bob was a pitcher when he
was a freshman. He has
volunteered his services," said
Young. "He has been throwing
batting practice."
Kim Hannaford's batting
average dropped below .400 for
the first time this season because
he went hitless in three trips
Tuesday. However, he still leads
the team with a .387 mark, 12 for
31. John Burtchaell came through
with a clutch hit in the eighth
inning for his second hit in three
times as a pinch hitter this year.
Today's starting pitcher for the
Cardinals is Mike Williamson
(1-0). Frost and At Arthur (0-3)
are slated for tomorrow's
doubleheader against Fresno
State.
Stanford has played Santa
Clara, which has lost only one
game, twice this year. Both games
the Cards were ahead but blew
leads to lose 7-4 and 10-7. "We
feel Santa Clara is not any better
than we are," said Young.
* * *
Diamond Notes: The Cards
have stolen 15 bases in 26
attempts this season. Stanford's
bag theft total last year was 39.
Centerfielder Ray Anderson, who
has been struggling at the plate,
collected a hit and a run batted in
Tuesday. He drove in Mark Lucich
on a ground ball back to the
pitcher in the second inning, then
singled his next time up.

where everything will fall into
place," said Cardinal coach Ray
Young. "We still have to improve
to get things done."
Tuesday's win over SJS has
been long in coming for the
Cardinals, who had been
wallowing in the doldrums of a
six-game losing streak.
Just when the Cards were
getting good pitching, the
Stanford bats turned cold —
almost as cold as the weather
which was wet at times. The game
had to be delayed 10 minutes
because of rain during the third
inning.
Frost Stars
"It's one of those things, the
pitching comes then the hitting
gets lax," said Young. "Dave
[Frost] pitched a good game. He
had almost as much velocity at
the end as he did at the
beginning."
Frost limited SJS to five hits in
going the distance to even his
record at 1-1 this year. Frost's
career mark is now 11-1.
The Cards have had five
one-run decisions this year,
including the last three games.
"We're not afraid to win or lose. I
don't think the ball club has done
that [given up| this year."
Stanford's style of play has
been noteworthy on the field, at
the plate and on the bases. And,
now the pitching seems to be
coming around.
"This ball club has the best
competitive attitude I've seen in
nine years," said team statistician
John Q. Wright.
The Cards showed their
scrappiness in the late innings
Tuesday by pulling out runs in the
eighth and ninth to overcome the
Spartans.
Good Omen
After the fifth the Cards were
behind 2-1, when Wright
remarked, "it may be a good
omen that we're behind." Five of
the games the Cards have lost this
year were when Stanford was
ahead after the first five innings.
Sophomore right-hander Ken
Grolle, who pitched on the varsity
last year before coming up with a
bad shoulder, has been working
out in practice. "They're
experimenting with Ken's
shoulder, taping it up so he can't
raise his arm to the point where it
hurts," said Young. "We may use
him in the Riverside Tournament
if he's ready. We're not going to
use him if there is any chance of
hurting him."
Another possibility to bolster
the Card pitching staff is

outfielder Bob Hampton, who has
volunteered to pitch.
"Bob was a pitcher when he
was a freshman. He has
volunteered his services," said
Young. "He has been throwing
batting practice."
Kim Hannaford's batting
average dropped below .400 for
the first time this season because
he went hitless in three trips
Tuesday. However, he still leads
the team with a .387 mark, 12 for
31. John Burtchaell came through
with a clutch hit in the eighth
inning for his second hit in three
times as a pinch hitter this year.
Today's starting pitcher for the
Cardinals is Mike Williamson
(1-0). Frost and At Arthur (0-3)
are slated for tomorrow's
doubleheader against Fresno
State.
Stanford has played Santa
Clara, which has lost only one
game, twice this year. Both games
the Cards were ahead but blew
leads to lose 7-4 and 10-7. "We
feel Santa Clara is not any better
than we are," said Young.

Diamond Notes: The Cards
have stolen 15 bases in 26
attempts this season. Stanford's
bag theft total last year was 39.
Centerfielder Ray Anderson, who
has been struggling at the plate,
collected a hit and a run batted in
Tuesday. He drove in Mark Lucich
on a ground ball back to the
pitcher in the second inning, then
singled his next time up.
Stanford's baseball season has
been like a jigsaw puzzle. One
spends hours and hours staring at
the scattered pieces trying to find
the right pieces for the right
places. If you'll pardon the
analogy, the pieces are starting to
fall in place for the Cardinals.
The Cards, who edged Sail Jose
State Tuesday 3-2, will meet
Santa Clara University today at
2:30 p.m. in Buck Shaw Stadium.
Tomorrow, Stanford hosts Fresno
State in a 12 noon doubleheader
at Sunken Diamond.
