## Machismo Cagers Upset 
### PETE BHATIA 
Slaughterhouse-5 pulled off the first big upset of
the Intramural basketball playoff Wednesday night,
defeating fifth-seeded Machismo, 51-46.
Slaughterhouse, playing with only four players
in the game's final seven minutes rode John
Schoer's 12 second-half points to record the victory
after battling back from a 26-23 halftime deficit.
Normally hot-shooting Machismo was clanking
them all night and Slaughterhouse rebounded
Machismo's errant shots well, despite a definite
height disadvantage.
Schoor led all scorers with 21, while Kevin
Enright topped Machismo with 19. Kel Lindsey
added eight for Slaughterhouse.
Slaughterhouse now advances to the
quarterfinals, where they will meet the winner of
Monday night's Culo-Wildmen battle.

third-ranked Theta Delta Chi used an incredible
shooting performance and dominance of the boards

approximately 70 percent from the floor in the
win, which propelled them into the quarterfinals.
They will meet the winner of the Mighty
Mites-Macs game scheduled for Monday.
The Theta Delts also had a remarkably balanced
scoring effort, led by Shaun Sullivan with 14.
George "Jelly" Fisher added 13 while Jim lams and
Willie Mannon chipped in 12 apiece.
In the "B" toumey, the top two seeds both
advanced, but not without a little trouble.

16 points, Rinc's Don Hunt led all scorers with 22.

lead, at one point fell behind by three, but came
back to edge the Orange II Porf's, 39-36. Dada had
a 29-14 halftime margin but the Porf's Mark

Totoritis scored 14 of his 22 points in the second
half to lead their comeback.
