# Sprint Relay Eyes Three-Minute Mark
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
"There are a million stories in the naked
city." Make that a million and four. Four
of the biggest stories on the Stanford
campus this winter are Dave Fairbank,
Bruce Goodwin, Dean Anderson and
Martin Pedley. These are the members of
the Stanford swimming team's sprint relay,
probably the greatest relay in Stanford
history and possibly the greatest relay of
all time.
It's rare for a collegiate team to have
two nationally ranked sprinters. Stanford
has four. And each member of the quartet
has already established himself as a
full-fledged star.
Collegiate swimming is a sport that
requires a long background of competition.
With the exception of Goodwin, Stanford's
sprinters have swum with top-flight
competition most of their lives.
Fairbank, a freshman from Sacramento,
has been competing since he was nine.
Although he got his start at the YMCA,
Dave soon came under the tutelage of
Olympic coach Sherm Chavoor at the
Arden Hills Swim Club.
All-Time Record
As a freshman in high school Dave
participated in the AAU nationals and as a
junior he tied the all-time high school
50-yard freestyle record of 20.7. That
summer in the Olympic Trials he surprised
a lot of people by placing sixth in the 100
meter freestyle, thus qualifying as an
alternate for Munich.
To Dave the best part about swimming
is the travel. "It gets me places. Just for
swimming two laps I get to go to Germany.
It's an easy way to see the world."
Dan Anderson has competed for 14
years. A junior from North Highlands, he
too swam for Arden Hills before coming to
Stanford. Dean admits he's been in the
water a long time: "I've probably swum
more hours than the amount of beers I've
drunken." Yet he still appreciates
swimming as a major part of his life.

In his freshman year the goateed
psychology-communications major placed
sixth in the 50 free at the NCAA's. Last
year he clocked a 45.8 to place third in the
100 at the NCAA's and win himself enough
recognition to be chosen for the Student
Games In Moscow last summer. There he
placed third in the 100.
'Wall Street Trip'
Martin Pedley is the senior member of

this illustrious foursome. This is his 16th
year of competition. Captain of the swim
team, Martin holds the Stanford record for
the 100 yard freestyle. In 1971 he
anchored the NCAA champion medley
relay, splitting a 44.8. Graduating at the
end of this quarter as an economics major,
Martin plans to pursue the "Wall Street
trip" once out of Stanford. When asked
what swimming has meant to him aftet all

these years, he simply stated that he's
"largely of the Fairbank opinion."
The only sprinter with relatively little
swimming background before Stanford is
Bruce Goodwin. Although he started
competing when he was 12, it wasn't until
Bruce came to Stanford that he first
encountered big-time training. "I was a
mess in practice. I couldn't swim that way
[training hard) when I got here. I was
destroying my body."
As the year progressed, Goodwin took
up self-hypnosis. "It helped me to relax
and concentrate." In the 1973 NCAA's, his
first big meet, Bruce placed 12th in the 50
in 21.2. This year Goodwin, a sophomore
architecture major, has abandoned his
self-hypnosis and replaced it with
confidence based on experience. Looking
forward to the NCAA's, Bruce said, "I
think we're really going to kick ass, to tell
you the truth."

At the end of this month, these four
swimmers will be combining forces at the
NCAA championships. In the 400 yard
freestyle relay they will try to be the first
team to ever break three minutes. That's
averaging under 45.0 per man.
Spring coach Jeff Hammett feels that
three teams will be under three minutes.
But he said, "We will swim one hell of a
race as a team at the NCAA's. I am
absolutely sure. Somebody will have to go
god-awful fast to beat us."
Last year's relay placed second in the
NCAA's in 3:03.11. Currently this year's
best is a 3:05.8. Are the sprinters confident
of winning this year? Goodwin
commented, "All four of us are confident
and we like to win and that's all you
need." Pedley said, "There could be two
relays under three minutes, but we still
figure on being the first one to finish."
That's story number one million and
five.

these years, he simply stated that he's
"largely of the Fairbank opinion."
The only sprinter with relatively little
swimming background before Stanford is
Bruce Goodwin. Although he started
competing when he was 12, it wasn't until
Bruce came to Stanford that he first
encountered big-time training. "I was a
mess in practice. I couldn't swim that way
[training hard) when I got here. I was
destroying my body."
As the year progressed, Goodwin took
up self-hypnosis. "It helped me to relax
and concentrate." In the 1973 NCAA's, his
first big meet, Bruce placed 12th in the 50
in 21.2. This year Goodwin, a sophomore
architecture major, has abandoned his
self-hypnosis and replaced it with
confidence based on experience. Looking
forward to the NCAA's, Bruce said, "I
think we're really going to kick ass, to tell
you the truth."

At the end of this month, these four
swimmers will be combining forces at the
NCAA championships. In the 400 yard
freestyle relay they will try to be the first
team to ever break three minutes. That's
averaging under 45.0 per man.
Spring coach Jeff Hammett feels that
three teams will be under three minutes.
But he said, "We will swim one hell of a
race as a team at the NCAA's. I am
absolutely sure. Somebody will have to go
god-awful fast to beat us."
Last year's relay placed second in the
NCAA's in 3:03.11. Currently this year's
best is a 3:05.8. Are the sprinters confident
of winning this year? Goodwin
commented, "All four of us are confident
and we like to win and that's all you
need." Pedley said, "There could be two
relays under three minutes, but we still
figure on being the first one to finish."
That's story number one million and
five.

BRUCE GOODWIN AND DEAN ANDERSON
"There are a million stories in the naked
city." Make that a million and four. Four
of the biggest stories on the Stanford
campus this winter are Dave Fairbank,
Bruce Goodwin, Dean Anderson and
Martin Pedley. These are the members of
the Stanford swimming team's sprint relay,
probably the greatest relay in Stanford
history and possibly the greatest relay of
all time.
It's rare for a collegiate team to have
two nationally ranked sprinters. Stanford
has four. And each member of the quartet
has already established himself as a
full-fledged star.
Collegiate swimming is a sport that
requires a long background of competition.
With the exception of Goodwin, Stanford's
sprinters have swum with top-flight
competition most of their lives.
Fairbank, a freshman from Sacramento,
has been competing since he was nine.
Although he got his start at the YMCA,
Dave soon came under the tutelage of
Olympic coach Sherm Chavoor at the
Arden Hills Swim Club.
All-Time Record
As a freshman in high school Dave
participated in the AAU nationals and as a
junior he tied the all-time high school
50-yard freestyle record of 20.7. That
summer in the Olympic Trials he surprised
a lot of people by placing sixth in the 100
meter freestyle, thus qualifying as an
alternate for Munich.
To Dave the best part about swimming
is the travel. "It gets me places. Just for
swimming two laps I get to go to Germany.
It's an easy way to see the world."
Dan Anderson has competed for 14
years. A junior from North Highlands, he
too swam for Arden Hills before coming to
Stanford. Dean admits he's been in the
water a long time: "I've probably swum
more hours than the amount of beers I've
drunken." Yet he still appreciates
swimming as a major part of his life.

In his freshman year the goateed
psychology-communications major placed
sixth in the 50 free at the NCAA's. Last
year he clocked a 45.8 to place third in the
100 at the NCAA's and win himself enough
recognition to be chosen for the Student
Games In Moscow last summer. There he
placed third in the 100.
'Wall Street Trip'
Martin Pedley is the senior member of

this illustrious foursome. This is his 16th
year of competition. Captain of the swim
team, Martin holds the Stanford record for
the 100 yard freestyle. In 1971 he
anchored the NCAA champion medley
relay, splitting a 44.8. Graduating at the
end of this quarter as an economics major,
Martin plans to pursue the "Wall Street
trip" once out of Stanford. When asked
what swimming has meant to him aftet all

these years, he simply stated that he's
"largely of the Fairbank opinion."

sprinters have swum with top-flight
competition most of their lives.
Fairbank, a freshman from Sacramento,
has been competing since he was nine.
Although he got his start at the YMCA,
Dave soon came under the tutelage of
Olympic coach Sherm Chavoor at the
Arden Hills Swim Club.
All-Time Record
As a freshman in high school Dave
participated in the AAU nationals and as a
junior he tied the all-time high school
50-yard freestyle record of 20.7. That
summer in the Olympic Trials he surprised
a lot of people by placing sixth in the 100
meter freestyle, thus qualifying as an
alternate for Munich.
To Dave the best part about swimming
is the travel. "It gets me places. Just for
swimming two laps I get to go to Germany.
It's an easy way to see the world."
Dan Anderson has competed for 14
years. A junior from North Highlands, he
too swam for Arden Hills before coming to
Stanford. Dean admits he's been in the
water a long time: "I've probably swum
more hours than the amount of beers I've
drunken." Yet he still appreciates
swimming as a major part of his life.

In his freshman year the goateed
psychology-communications major placed
sixth in the 50 free at the NCAA's. Last
year he clocked a 45.8 to place third in the
100 at the NCAA's and win himself enough
recognition to be chosen for the Student
Games In Moscow last summer. There he
placed third in the 100.
'Wall Street Trip'
Martin Pedley is the senior member of

this illustrious foursome. This is his 16th
year of competition. Captain of the swim
team, Martin holds the Stanford record for
the 100 yard freestyle. In 1971 he
anchored the NCAA champion medley
relay, splitting a 44.8. Graduating at the
end of this quarter as an economics major,
Martin plans to pursue the "Wall Street
trip" once out of Stanford. When asked
what swimming has meant to him aftet all

these years, he simply stated that he's
"largely of the Fairbank opinion."
The only sprinter with relatively little
swimming background before Stanford is
Bruce Goodwin. Although he started
competing when he was 12, it wasn't until
Bruce came to Stanford that he first
encountered big-time training. "I was a
mess in practice. I couldn't swim that way
[training hard) when I got here. I was
destroying my body."
As the year progressed, Goodwin took
up self-hypnosis. "It helped me to relax
and concentrate." In the 1973 NCAA's, his
first big meet, Bruce placed 12th in the 50
in 21.2. This year Goodwin, a sophomore
architecture major, has abandoned his
self-hypnosis and replaced it with
confidence based on experience. Looking
forward to the NCAA's, Bruce said, "I
think we're really going to kick ass, to tell
you the truth."
Three-Minute Banner
At the end of this month, these four
swimmers will be combining forces at the
NCAA championships. In the 400 yard
freestyle relay they will try to be the first
team to ever break three minutes. That's
averaging under 45.0 per man.
Spring coach Jeff Hammett feels that
three teams will be under three minutes.
But he said, "We will swim one hell of a
race as a team at the NCAA's. I am
absolutely sure. Somebody will have to go
god-awful fast to beat us."
Last year's relay placed second in the
NCAA's in 3:03.11. Currently this year's
best is a 3:05.8. Are the sprinters confident
of winning this year? Goodwin
commented, "All four of us are confident
and we like to win and that's all you
need." Pedley said, "There could be two
relays under three minutes, but we still
figure on being the first one to finish."
That's story number one million and
five.
