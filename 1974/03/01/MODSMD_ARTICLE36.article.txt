# Inconsistent Cards Await Crucial Weekend Games
## JVs Host Pacific, Sacto St. 
### TIM FERGUSON 
When Stanford's junior varsity
traveled to Stockton last January,
the Card cagers had to shoot at a
.742 clip from the foul line to eke
out a 73-70 win over the
University of the Pacific JV.
Tonight at Maples at 6 p.m.,
Cardinal coach Billy Jones will be
expecting his squad to be just as
successful in making "the easiest
shot in the world." Jones says of
his team's earlier free throw
performance, "They're capable of
doing that every time."
Indeed Stanford had better do
as well at the charity stripe unless
it intends to play stronger on the
boards than it did last January.
Pacific outrebounded the Cards,
44-28, a situation Jones says
"better change. We can't expect
to win" with such a carom deficit.
Marty Moroski, who against
Pacific in January had what was
then his finest game of the season,
will rejoin the JV tonight after a
two-game hiatus with the varsity.
Moroski leads the team in scoring
average with 15.6 points per
game.
As usual, Moroski will not
start. The opening quintet will
feature Scott Russell, Sven
Walker, Terry McCartin, Mike
Bowen and Ken Jurgensen.
Jones says he knows "not a
thing" about the Sacramento
State JV, Stanford's opponent
tomorrow night in what is likely
to be the most heavily attended
JV game of the season as fans
pour in earli for the varsity's
match-up with UCLA.
The Hornets feature starters at
6-6 and 6-5, but do not appear to
have any major height advantage
over the Cardinals.
No contest with the USC or
UCLA junior varsities are
scheduled, Jones says, because of
the "expense of carrying another
12 guys and putting them up for a
couple days."
Jones hasn't noticed the strain
of a long season affecting his team
in practice. "With no weekend
practices, they get just enough
time off," the coach says. "By
Monday they're a little energetic."
He says that a two-week break the
team received prior to its last two
outings combined with the
Christmas holiday have made the
schedule "seem just like three
different seasons, really."
