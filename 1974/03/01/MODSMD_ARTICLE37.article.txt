# Wrestlers Face Tough Pac-8 Test
## 
### STEVE SOULE 
The Pac-8 meet, the highlight
of the season for Stanford's
wrestling team, begins at 1 p.m.
this afternoon at Berkeley. It is a
two-day affair, with preliminaries
from 1 to 4 p.m. today, semifinals
from 7 to 9 tonight, and the finals
tomorrow night from 5 to 9:30.
Stanford will not be in the
running for the team
championship, according to coach
Joe De Meo, who feels that,
"Oregon State, Oregon,
Washington and UCLA are the
teams to beat." The Cards,
however, can definitely affect the
outcome by playing the role of
the spoiler.
De Meo is certain the winner
will come out of those four teams,
all of which are rated among the
nation's top 20. He explains, "It's
really tough to predict, in a
seven-team meet situation like this
| USC doesn't field a wrestling
team), what team will win. It
depends on upsets, and who beats
whom. Individuals advance, not
teams. . . it's not at all like a
basketball tournament."
This year's team, although
decimated by injuries, has been a
good one, as evidenced by the fact
that the Cards set a school record
for most wins in one season. But
Stanford competes in the Pac-8,
which is one of the strongest
conferences in the nation.
"Year in and year out the
Pac-8 is one of the toughest
conferences in the NCAA," says
De Meo. "I think we could win a
lot of conferences, but we just
happen to have a lot of good
wrestlers in a difficult league."
Even though Stanford's team
chances are not bright, many of
the Card individuals have good
chances to place in the top four,
and advance to the NCAA's in
Ames, lowa next weekend.
De Meo comments, "We always
take the positive approach. We
have eight guys who are capable
of placing, and hopefully some of
them will. There are very few
wrestlers in the league who are
really better than any of them."
Stanford's best bet for a high
finish has to be Emmett Stanton
(158). Last year as a sophomore,
Stanton took fourth in the Pac-8.

Although he has missed a lot of
this season due to injuries, he has
looked good lately.
De Meo believes that four
others have just about as much of
a chance as Stanton; freshmen
Mark Yancey (142) and Charlie
Masch (150), sophomore Roy
Tolles (190) and junior Marc
Frelier (167). "All four have
outstanding winning records and
good chances to place, but
Emmett has to have the best
chance, as he's a returning
placewinner," De Meo said.
Also touted by De Meo as
having chances to finish high are
freshman Jeff Richardson (177),
sophomore Jim Tatarakis (126)
and junior Kris Westersund (Hwt).
The injuries that have
hampered Stanford all year are
still a deciding factor. De Meo
bites his lip when he says, "We
have four guys who are hurt, who
Ui my opinion could all place in
the top two in the conference;
Gary Anderson, Ken Krebs, Chris
Horpel and John Govea."

the Card individuals have good
chances to place in the top four,
and advance to the NCAA's in
Ames, lowa next weekend.
De Meo comments, "We always
take the positive approach. We
have eight guys who are capable
of placing, and hopefully some of
them will. There are very few
wrestlers in the league who are
really better than any of them."
Stanford's best bet for a high
finish has to be Emmett Stanton
(158). Last year as a sophomore,
Stanton took fourth in the Pac-8.

Although he has missed a lot of
this season due to injuries, he has
looked good lately.
De Meo believes that four
others have just about as much of
a chance as Stanton; freshmen
Mark Yancey (142) and Charlie
Masch (150), sophomore Roy
Tolles (190) and junior Marc
Frelier (167). "All four have
outstanding winning records and
good chances to place, but
Emmett has to have the best
chance, as he's a returning
placewinner," De Meo said.
Also touted by De Meo as
having chances to finish high are
freshman Jeff Richardson (177),
sophomore Jim Tatarakis (126)
and junior Kris Westersund (Hwt).
The injuries that have
hampered Stanford all year are
still a deciding factor. De Meo
bites his lip when he says, "We
have four guys who are hurt, who
Ui my opinion could all place in
the top two in the conference;
Gary Anderson, Ken Krebs, Chris
Horpel and John Govea."
The Pac-8 meet, the highlight
of the season for Stanford's
wrestling team, begins at 1 p.m.
this afternoon at Berkeley. It is a
two-day affair, with preliminaries
from 1 to 4 p.m. today, semifinals
from 7 to 9 tonight, and the finals
tomorrow night from 5 to 9:30.
Stanford will not be in the
running for the team
championship, according to coach
Joe De Meo, who feels that,
"Oregon State, Oregon,
Washington and UCLA are the
teams to beat." The Cards,
however, can definitely affect the
outcome by playing the role of
the spoiler.
De Meo is certain the winner
will come out of those four teams,
all of which are rated among the
nation's top 20. He explains, "It's
really tough to predict, in a
seven-team meet situation like this
| USC doesn't field a wrestling
team), what team will win. It
depends on upsets, and who beats
whom. Individuals advance, not
teams. . . it's not at all like a
basketball tournament."
This year's team, although
decimated by injuries, has been a
good one, as evidenced by the fact
that the Cards set a school record
for most wins in one season. But
Stanford competes in the Pac-8,
which is one of the strongest
conferences in the nation.
"Year in and year out the
Pac-8 is one of the toughest
conferences in the NCAA," says
De Meo. "I think we could win a
lot of conferences, but we just
happen to have a lot of good
wrestlers in a difficult league."
Even though Stanford's team
chances are not bright, many of
the Card individuals have good
chances to place in the top four,
and advance to the NCAA's in
Ames, lowa next weekend.
