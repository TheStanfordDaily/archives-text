# Stanford Vs. Fresno State
## Spikers Set For Opener 
### MARK WHITE 
Tomorrow at 1 p.m., a mixed
squad of veterans and freshmen
opens the dual meet outdoor
track season against Fresno State
in Fresno. Stanford will be trying
to approach last year's 128-31
thrashing of Fresno, and to
increase the 25-1 record the Cards
have held over the Bulldogs since
1934.
"Overall we are a very
competitive team," said head
coach Payton Jordan, now in his
18th year as Stanford track coach.
"We started at the top last week
at El Paso, and our men
performed admirably. If we
continue to improve, some will do
well in the nationals and others
will do well in the league.
"Although we have some
weaknesses, we have strengths
also. Our men work hard and they
do so willingly. We are really
happy with their attitude. Other
teams may have individuals who
are gifted with more natural
talent, but it seems nobody works
as hard as we do. As a result,
simply to be competitive, our men
come closer to their maximum

output and I think this is quite a
tribute to them."
Youth Abounds
Cardinal reliance on youth is
reflected in the 440 relay lineup
for tomorrow's meet. Due to
graduation and injuries, not a
single member of last year's world
record 880 relay quartet will be
running in the quarter relay
against Fresno.
Instead, freshmen Scott Wingo,
Manuel Gonzalez and Marvin
Holmes will team up with Diablo
JC transfer Otto Rosner in a relay
Jordan describes as "the best
we've been able to field in years."
Wingo is a fine all-around sprinter,
having run 9.8 in the hundred,
21.9 in the 220 and 48.5 in the
quarter. Holmes is a slow starting
— but powerful — 220 specialist
who has run 21.6. Gonzales was
the class "B" champion in the
tough Los Angeles league for the
100. And Rossner, a quick starter,
was a finalist in the 1973 state JC
meet.
Behind this depth of quality
sprinters is the outstanding, but
injury-plagued Ken Curl, who has
run 9.3 in the 100. A healthy,
consistent Curl and Stanford's
wealth of newcomers will give any
opponent plenty to handle in the
springs.
Bagshaw Leads Hurdlers
Dave Bagshaw, a double winner
in his specialties last week at the
El Paso relays, leads a fine group
of hurdlers. Bagshaw's lifetime
best of 52.6 and Matt Hogsett's
53.0 in the 440 intermediates are
both among the all-time best 10
times for Cardinals. Joining
Bagshaw in the 120 highs are
Greg Densmore and football
fullback Andy Koleskinow.
Decathlon king Ken Kring will
lead Stanford's mile relay team.
Joining him will be Hogsett,
Wingo and senior John Kessel,
who has run a 47.4 leg. In the
quarter itself, Kessel and Wingo
will lead the way this week.
The distance situation has been
described by assistant coach
Marshall Clark as "promising."
Although there is some question
as to the eligibility of valuable
veteran Vernell Jackson (1:53.0)
in the 880, feisty Ben Scheible
(1:55.7) returns after a year's
absence. Art Pitch ford will also be
running the half.
Normally a two- or three-miler,
NCAA cross country finalist Tony
Sandoval will lead the Stanford
contingent in the mile. Steve
Crowley (4:11.3), Dave Allen

(4:15.0) and Jeff Parietti (4:12.0)
round out a deep, talented core of
solid milers.
Distance Threats
Mark McConnell ran a 9:02.0
in the two-mile in 1973, placing
him in the top 10 on the Stanford
list. Jack Bellah, Frank Boutin
and Jeff Norton will join
McConnell in the two-mile
tomorrow.
Doug McClean, Bob Hay man
and George Babikan round out
Stanford's distance contingent by
entering the 3000-meter
steeplechase.
In the field events, the versatile
Kring and jump-happy Mike Hall
lead the Cardinals. Kring, who
went 15-0 last week in placing
third at El Paso, will accompany
Phil Hubbard in the pole vault.
Kring then joins Hall in the long
jump, and the latter will also
compete in the high and triple
jumps. Derek Tolliver will be
hoping to improve on his fine
47-ll 1 /2 triple against Cal last
season, while Bob Laney hopes to
improve on his 6-4V& mark in the
high jump.
Provided he can run on a
recently injured ankle, Steve
Hopkins will be competing in the
javelin. His 224-9 thrown this year
marks him in the top 10 in that
event also.

tribute to them."
Youth Abounds
Cardinal reliance on youth is
reflected in the 440 relay lineup
for tomorrow's meet. Due to
graduation and injuries, not a
single member of last year's world
record 880 relay quartet will be
running in the quarter relay
against Fresno.
Instead, freshmen Scott Wingo,
Manuel Gonzalez and Marvin
Holmes will team up with Diablo
JC transfer Otto Rosner in a relay
Jordan describes as "the best
we've been able to field in years."
Wingo is a fine all-around sprinter,
having run 9.8 in the hundred,
21.9 in the 220 and 48.5 in the
quarter. Holmes is a slow starting
— but powerful — 220 specialist
who has run 21.6. Gonzales was
the class "B" champion in the
tough Los Angeles league for the
100. And Rossner, a quick starter,
was a finalist in the 1973 state JC
meet.
Behind this depth of quality
sprinters is the outstanding, but
injury-plagued Ken Curl, who has
run 9.3 in the 100. A healthy,
consistent Curl and Stanford's
wealth of newcomers will give any
opponent plenty to handle in the
springs.
Bagshaw Leads Hurdlers
Dave Bagshaw, a double winner
in his specialties last week at the
El Paso relays, leads a fine group
of hurdlers. Bagshaw's lifetime
best of 52.6 and Matt Hogsett's
53.0 in the 440 intermediates are
both among the all-time best 10
times for Cardinals. Joining
Bagshaw in the 120 highs are
Greg Densmore and football
fullback Andy Koleskinow.
Decathlon king Ken Kring will
lead Stanford's mile relay team.
Joining him will be Hogsett,
Wingo and senior John Kessel,
who has run a 47.4 leg. In the
quarter itself, Kessel and Wingo
will lead the way this week.
The distance situation has been
described by assistant coach
Marshall Clark as "promising."
Although there is some question
as to the eligibility of valuable
veteran Vernell Jackson (1:53.0)
in the 880, feisty Ben Scheible
(1:55.7) returns after a year's
absence. Art Pitch ford will also be
running the half.
Normally a two- or three-miler,
NCAA cross country finalist Tony
Sandoval will lead the Stanford
contingent in the mile. Steve
Crowley (4:11.3), Dave Allen

(4:15.0) and Jeff Parietti (4:12.0)
round out a deep, talented core of
solid milers.
Distance Threats
Mark McConnell ran a 9:02.0
in the two-mile in 1973, placing
him in the top 10 on the Stanford
list. Jack Bellah, Frank Boutin
and Jeff Norton will join
McConnell in the two-mile
tomorrow.
Doug McClean, Bob Hay man
and George Babikan round out
Stanford's distance contingent by
entering the 3000-meter
steeplechase.
In the field events, the versatile
Kring and jump-happy Mike Hall
lead the Cardinals. Kring, who
went 15-0 last week in placing
third at El Paso, will accompany
Phil Hubbard in the pole vault.
Kring then joins Hall in the long
jump, and the latter will also
compete in the high and triple
jumps. Derek Tolliver will be
hoping to improve on his fine
47-ll 1 /2 triple against Cal last
season, while Bob Laney hopes to
improve on his 6-4V& mark in the
high jump.
Provided he can run on a
recently injured ankle, Steve
Hopkins will be competing in the
javelin. His 224-9 thrown this year
marks him in the top 10 in that
event also.
Tomorrow at 1 p.m., a mixed
squad of veterans and freshmen
opens the dual meet outdoor
track season against Fresno State
in Fresno. Stanford will be trying
to approach last year's 128-31
thrashing of Fresno, and to
increase the 25-1 record the Cards
have held over the Bulldogs since
1934.
"Overall we are a very
competitive team," said head
coach Payton Jordan, now in his
18th year as Stanford track coach.
"We started at the top last week
at El Paso, and our men
performed admirably. If we
continue to improve, some will do
well in the nationals and others
will do well in the league.
"Although we have some
weaknesses, we have strengths
also. Our men work hard and they
do so willingly. We are really
happy with their attitude. Other
teams may have individuals who
are gifted with more natural
talent, but it seems nobody works
as hard as we do. As a result,
simply to be competitive, our men
come closer to their maximum

output and I think this is quite a
tribute to them."

run 9.3 in the 100. A healthy,
consistent Curl and Stanford's
wealth of newcomers will give any
opponent plenty to handle in the
springs.
Bagshaw Leads Hurdlers
Dave Bagshaw, a double winner
in his specialties last week at the
El Paso relays, leads a fine group
of hurdlers. Bagshaw's lifetime
best of 52.6 and Matt Hogsett's
53.0 in the 440 intermediates are
both among the all-time best 10
times for Cardinals. Joining
Bagshaw in the 120 highs are
Greg Densmore and football
fullback Andy Koleskinow.
Decathlon king Ken Kring will
lead Stanford's mile relay team.
Joining him will be Hogsett,
Wingo and senior John Kessel,
who has run a 47.4 leg. In the
quarter itself, Kessel and Wingo
will lead the way this week.
The distance situation has been
described by assistant coach
Marshall Clark as "promising."
Although there is some question
as to the eligibility of valuable
veteran Vernell Jackson (1:53.0)
in the 880, feisty Ben Scheible
(1:55.7) returns after a year's
absence. Art Pitch ford will also be
running the half.
Normally a two- or three-miler,
NCAA cross country finalist Tony
Sandoval will lead the Stanford
contingent in the mile. Steve
Crowley (4:11.3), Dave Allen

(4:15.0) and Jeff Parietti (4:12.0)
round out a deep, talented core of
solid milers.
Distance Threats
Mark McConnell ran a 9:02.0
in the two-mile in 1973, placing
him in the top 10 on the Stanford
list. Jack Bellah, Frank Boutin
and Jeff Norton will join
McConnell in the two-mile
tomorrow.
Doug McClean, Bob Hay man
and George Babikan round out
Stanford's distance contingent by
entering the 3000-meter
steeplechase.
In the field events, the versatile
Kring and jump-happy Mike Hall
lead the Cardinals. Kring, who
went 15-0 last week in placing
third at El Paso, will accompany
Phil Hubbard in the pole vault.
Kring then joins Hall in the long
jump, and the latter will also
compete in the high and triple
jumps. Derek Tolliver will be
hoping to improve on his fine
47-ll 1 /2 triple against Cal last
season, while Bob Laney hopes to
improve on his 6-4V& mark in the
high jump.
Provided he can run on a
recently injured ankle, Steve
Hopkins will be competing in the
javelin. His 224-9 thrown this year
marks him in the top 10 in that
event also.
Tomorrow at 1 p.m., a mixed
squad of veterans and freshmen
opens the dual meet outdoor
track season against Fresno State
in Fresno. Stanford will be trying
to approach last year's 128-31
thrashing of Fresno, and to
increase the 25-1 record the Cards
have held over the Bulldogs since
1934.
"Overall we are a very
competitive team," said head
coach Payton Jordan, now in his
18th year as Stanford track coach.
"We started at the top last week
at El Paso, and our men
performed admirably. If we
continue to improve, some will do
well in the nationals and others
will do well in the league.
"Although we have some
weaknesses, we have strengths
also. Our men work hard and they
do so willingly. We are really
happy with their attitude. Other
teams may have individuals who
are gifted with more natural
talent, but it seems nobody works
as hard as we do. As a result,
simply to be competitive, our men
come closer to their maximum

output and I think this is quite a
tribute to them."
Youth Abounds
Cardinal reliance on youth is
reflected in the 440 relay lineup
for tomorrow's meet. Due to
graduation and injuries, not a
single member of last year's world
record 880 relay quartet will be
running in the quarter relay
against Fresno.
Instead, freshmen Scott Wingo,
Manuel Gonzalez and Marvin
Holmes will team up with Diablo
JC transfer Otto Rosner in a relay
Jordan describes as "the best
we've been able to field in years."
Wingo is a fine all-around sprinter,
having run 9.8 in the hundred,
21.9 in the 220 and 48.5 in the
quarter. Holmes is a slow starting
— but powerful — 220 specialist
who has run 21.6. Gonzales was
the class "B" champion in the
tough Los Angeles league for the
100. And Rossner, a quick starter,
was a finalist in the 1973 state JC
meet.
Behind this depth of quality
sprinters is the outstanding, but
injury-plagued Ken Curl, who has
run 9.3 in the 100. A healthy,
consistent Curl and Stanford's
wealth of newcomers will give any
opponent plenty to handle in the
springs.
