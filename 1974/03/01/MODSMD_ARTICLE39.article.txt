# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Continuing an up-and-down
season that has rivaled even the
mysterious Stanford Cardinals,
the Daily's fearless forecaster
correctly predicted all eight
games last week, improving his
season record to 46-16. The
week before he was only as
reliable as a coin toss (4-4),
proving that Pacific Eight
basketball is hopelessly chaotic
and unpredictable.
The only thing that happens
each week is that two
exhausted dubs play on TV
Saturday afternoon — and the
home team always wins.
So this week, we'll start
with the automatic TV game,
USC vs. California at Harmon
Gym. Only this time the
visitors will win, giving Dick
Enberg and Dave Gambee
plenty to talk about in the
waning moments of a dull
contest.

On Friday, UCLA should
waltz past Cat at the Oakland
Coliseum and Stanford will
upset USC. Saturday, the
Bruins will edge the Cards,
Oregon will oust Washington
and OSU will handle
Washington State. Monday,
Washington will nip the
Beavers while Oregon mauls
the Cougars.
Closing with an appropraite
reminder that 11 Pac-8 games
have been decided by five
points or less — meaning that
these predictions are indeed
fallible — here is the weekly
forecast:
Stanford 72, USC 68
UCLA 85, California 61
USC 76, California 58
UCL 1 67, Stanford 61
Oregon 66, Washington 60
OSU 79, Washington St. 69
Washington 87, OSU 85
Oregon 80, Washington St. 60
