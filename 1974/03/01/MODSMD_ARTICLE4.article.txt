# County To Require Odd-Even Gas Plan
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors voted 3 to 0 yesterday to
adopt the state's proposed odd-even
gas plan on a mandatory basis
beginning Monday. All gas stations in
the Stanford-Palo Alto area will be
affected.
The plan, advocated earlier this
week by Gov. Ronald Reagan,
provides that motorists with
odd-numbered license plates will only
be able to buy gas on odd-numbered
days of the month and that motorists
with even-numbered plates will be able
to buy gas on even-numbered days.
License plates which only contain
letters are classified with
odd-numbered plates. Motorists with
out-of-state plates can buy gas on any
day.
This differs from the current
voluntary odd-even plan, instituted
Feb. 11, which recommends that
motorists with odd-numbered plates
buy gas on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays, and that motorists with even
plates buy gas on Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays.
While the current plan is only
carried out at the discretion of the
individual gas station operator or
motorist, the new mandatory plan will
make violations misdemeanors. A gas
station operator who violates the
regulations faces a fine of up to $500
or a jail sentence of up to six
months.
Other Counties
Earlier yesterday, the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors also
voted in favor of the plan. The Santa
Clara and San Mateo votes brought to
a total of nine the number of
California counties which have
adopted the plan. These include
Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano, Los
Angeles, Modoc, Orange and Santa
Cruz counties.Over half of California's
licensed drivers and vehicles are
registered in these counties.
Santa Clara County Supervisor Don

Cortese told the Daily that the Board
adopted the mandatory regulations
because "the dealers came in and told
us yesterday and again today •. . that
the voluntary plan was only 60
percent effective."
Because "all our neighboring
counties" adopted the plan, Cortese
said that if Santa Clara County
declined to approve the plan,
motorists from neighboring counties
would flock to this county to buy gas.
"We'd have open season down here,"
he explained.
Although the San Jose chapter of
the National Association of Service
Station Dealers endorsed the plan,
Cortese added that officers of the
National Association had reservations
about it.
"Their spokesmen would prefer an
appointment program," Cortese said,
"and they were asking us to hold the
plan for a few weeks" until they could
implement an appointment program
on a trial basis.
Under such a program, only a
motorist who had made an
appointment would be served at a
particular gas station.
Cortese said the Board voted to
adopt the new mandatory plan
anyway because "this plan is subject
to our reaffirmation every 14 days."
However, Cortese said the Board is
"going to ask the governor's office
whether the appointment and the
odd-even plan are compatible."
"What we'd like to do is try the
apportionment system on a trial
basis," Cortese explained, with
perhaps 10 stations in the county
using the appointment system.
Doubts Effectiveness
Ken Davis, president of the San
Jose chapter of the national gas
dealers association, said he was fully
in favor of the program, but expressed
doubts about whether the program
could be effective.
"We'll support the program,
