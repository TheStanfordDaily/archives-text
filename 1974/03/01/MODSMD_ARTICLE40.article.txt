# Cagers Hope To Salvage Season Against Los Angeles Powerhouses
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
With their hopes of post-season
play dashed by consistent
inconsistency, the Stanford
Cardinals will try to salvage a
winning season and dim someone
else's NCAA hopes when they
host USC and UCLA this weekend
at Maples Pavilion.
Two weeks ago Oregon and
Oregon State deviated from the
usual Pac-8 script when both beat
UCLA, so the Bruins now find
themselves heading north with
conference (9-2) and overall
(10-3) records that are matched
exactly by their crosstown rivals.
Stanford is the only bonafide
spoiler standing between the two
schools and their March 9 Pac-8
title bout.
Stanford enters the weekend
with a 5-6 conference record and
an 11-11 overall mark. Since only
Cal remains on the Cards'
schedule after this weekend, a win
against either southern school
would make a winning season
likely. Matching their 14-11
record of a year ago is a little
harder to picture.
When they travelled to Los
Angeles seven weeks ago, the
Cards played strongly against both
schools, but still lost twice, 64-57
to SC and 66-52 to a UCLA team
that was without Bill Walton.
Walton is not expected to be so
charitable tomorrow night.
But before worrying about
Walton et al, the Cards must
concern themselves tonight with
lOth-ranked USC. After years of
coaching in the lengthy shadow of
John Wooden, Trojan Coach Bob
Boyd finds himself with a golden
opportunity to end the Bruins'
Pac-8 domination next Saturday.
But he is far too close to that
long-elusive goal to look past
either Stanford or Cal.
Increasing Momentum
USC's momentum has been
increasing rapidly since they lost
to UCLA a month ago, and the
last two weekends the Trojans
have recorded impressive victories
over all four northern Pac-8
schools. The Trojans are led by
guards Gus Williams and Dan
Anderson, who are undoubtedly
the finest pair of backcourt men
in the league.
In their first meeting, the Cards
led SC by as many as eight points
early in the second half until the
combination of turnovers and
fouls which has plagued Stanford
all season took its toll. A repeat of
that 27-turnover performance
tonight against an obviously
improved Trojan squad would be
even harder to offset.

Against UCLA in January,
Stanford's turnovers were less
numerous than usual (17), but
still costly. The Cards had taken a
five-point lead in the first five
minutes of the game, but Stanford
soon committed four consecutive
turnovers which allowed for a
10-2 UCLA streak that put the
Bruins ahead to stay.
No Fluke
Since that time, UCLA has lost
three games and injected
excitement back into the college
basketball world. The Bruins'
vengeful crushing of Notre Dame
seemed to indicate that the earlier
loss had been a fluke, but then the
Oregon shockers occurred.
But when the Bruins romped
over Washington and Washington
State last weekend, it was obvious
that claims of a cumbled dynasty
were premature. The Bruins are
still very possibly the finest team
in the nation, but no one is about
to concede * tham an eighth
striaght NCAA title.
Regardless of the game's
outcome, the Kelley-Walton battle
promises to be a classic. Kelley
has always played well against
UCLA, and to add extra incentive
to their meeting, the two will
enter the weekend battling for the
Pac-8 scoring and rebounding
leads.
But as has been the case all
season, the key to Stanford's
success will not be its tall and
talented front line. As often as not
this year, Stanford's see-saw has
been controlled by the
performance of its guards.
Melvin Arterberry played
perhaps his finest basketball of
the season last weekend in Oregon
as he tossed in 22 important
points in addition to his usually
fine defensive play. Arterberry
and fellow guards Mark Gilberg,
Jim Montague, and Ben Bluitt will
have to play extremely strong
defense, especially against USC,
for Stanford to have much chance.
For Stanford, a season of
overwhelming frustrations could
be improved considerably with
strong performances this
weekend. And the optimism
generated by one or even two very
big victories would be greatly
increased by the fact that all five
of Stanford's probable starters
this weekend will return next
year. But if things run true to
form, Stanford will shoot 68
percent, commit 25 turnovers and
lose both games in the last two
seconds when USC and UCLA
convert two-shot flagrant
technical fouls. It's been that kind
of season.

as he tossed in 22 important
points in addition to his usually
fine defensive play. Arterberry
and fellow guards Mark Gilberg,
Jim Montague, and Ben Bluitt will
have to play extremely strong
defense, especially against USC,
for Stanford to have much chance.
For Stanford, a season of
overwhelming frustrations could
be improved considerably with
strong performances this
weekend. And the optimism
generated by one or even two very
big victories would be greatly
increased by the fact that all five
of Stanford's probable starters
this weekend will return next
year. But if things run true to
form, Stanford will shoot 68
percent, commit 25 turnovers and
lose both games in the last two
seconds when USC and UCLA
convert two-shot flagrant
technical fouls. It's been that kind
of season.
With their hopes of post-season
play dashed by consistent
inconsistency, the Stanford
Cardinals will try to salvage a
winning season and dim someone
else's NCAA hopes when they
host USC and UCLA this weekend
at Maples Pavilion.
Two weeks ago Oregon and
Oregon State deviated from the
usual Pac-8 script when both beat
UCLA, so the Bruins now find
themselves heading north with
conference (9-2) and overall
(10-3) records that are matched
exactly by their crosstown rivals.
Stanford is the only bonafide
spoiler standing between the two
schools and their March 9 Pac-8
title bout.
Stanford enters the weekend
with a 5-6 conference record and
an 11-11 overall mark. Since only
Cal remains on the Cards'
schedule after this weekend, a win
against either southern school
would make a winning season
likely. Matching their 14-11
record of a year ago is a little
harder to picture.
When they travelled to Los
Angeles seven weeks ago, the
Cards played strongly against both
schools, but still lost twice, 64-57
to SC and 66-52 to a UCLA team
that was without Bill Walton.
Walton is not expected to be so
charitable tomorrow night.
But before worrying about
Walton et al, the Cards must
concern themselves tonight with
lOth-ranked USC. After years of
coaching in the lengthy shadow of
John Wooden, Trojan Coach Bob
Boyd finds himself with a golden
opportunity to end the Bruins'
Pac-8 domination next Saturday.
But he is far too close to that
long-elusive goal to look past
either Stanford or Cal.
Increasing Momentum
USC's momentum has been
increasing rapidly since they lost
to UCLA a month ago, and the
last two weekends the Trojans
have recorded impressive victories
over all four northern Pac-8
schools. The Trojans are led by
guards Gus Williams and Dan
Anderson, who are undoubtedly
the finest pair of backcourt men
in the league.
In their first meeting, the Cards
led SC by as many as eight points
early in the second half until the
combination of turnovers and
fouls which has plagued Stanford
all season took its toll. A repeat of
that 27-turnover performance
tonight against an obviously
improved Trojan squad would be
even harder to offset.

Against UCLA in January,
Stanford's turnovers were less
numerous than usual (17), but
still costly. The Cards had taken a
five-point lead in the first five
minutes of the game, but Stanford
soon committed four consecutive
turnovers which allowed for a
10-2 UCLA streak that put the
Bruins ahead to stay.
No Fluke
Since that time, UCLA has lost
three games and injected
excitement back into the college
basketball world. The Bruins'
vengeful crushing of Notre Dame
seemed to indicate that the earlier
loss had been a fluke, but then the
Oregon shockers occurred.
But when the Bruins romped
over Washington and Washington
State last weekend, it was obvious
that claims of a cumbled dynasty
were premature. The Bruins are
still very possibly the finest team
in the nation, but no one is about
to concede * tham an eighth
striaght NCAA title.
Regardless of the game's
outcome, the Kelley-Walton battle
promises to be a classic. Kelley
has always played well against
UCLA, and to add extra incentive
to their meeting, the two will
enter the weekend battling for the
Pac-8 scoring and rebounding
leads.
But as has been the case all
season, the key to Stanford's
success will not be its tall and
talented front line. As often as not
this year, Stanford's see-saw has
been controlled by the
performance of its guards.

still very possibly the finest team
in the nation, but no one is about
to concede * tham an eighth
striaght NCAA title.
Regardless of the game's
outcome, the Kelley-Walton battle
promises to be a classic. Kelley
has always played well against
UCLA, and to add extra incentive
to their meeting, the two will
enter the weekend battling for the
Pac-8 scoring and rebounding
leads.
But as has been the case all
season, the key to Stanford's
success will not be its tall and
talented front line. As often as not
this year, Stanford's see-saw has
been controlled by the
performance of its guards.
Melvin Arterberry played
perhaps his finest basketball of
the season last weekend in Oregon
as he tossed in 22 important
points in addition to his usually
fine defensive play. Arterberry
and fellow guards Mark Gilberg,
Jim Montague, and Ben Bluitt will
have to play extremely strong
defense, especially against USC,
for Stanford to have much chance.
For Stanford, a season of
overwhelming frustrations could
be improved considerably with
strong performances this
weekend. And the optimism
generated by one or even two very
big victories would be greatly
increased by the fact that all five
of Stanford's probable starters
this weekend will return next
year. But if things run true to
form, Stanford will shoot 68
percent, commit 25 turnovers and
lose both games in the last two
seconds when USC and UCLA
convert two-shot flagrant
technical fouls. It's been that kind
of season.
