# Cards' Cool Sixth Man
## 'Mellow' Trobbe Hides Emotions 
### GLENN KRAMON 
By GLENN KRAMON

Take a look at the expression on junior
forward Scott Trobbe's face at any time
during this weekend's crucial games. Chances
are it won't display too much emotion. In
fact, from the look on his face, you might
think that Scott was downright blase, no
matter how tense the situation.
Mellow. That's how his teammates
describe his nonchalant, hang-loose style.
"Scott goes out of his way to appear carefree
and relaxed," says center Rich Kelley. "On
the court he has a loose way of playing, with
everything gangling about, but he always goes
all out."
And off the court, the 6-6 economics
major from Tiburon, an easygoing little town
just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, seems
just as casual.
His loping walk can be compared to that
of a loose giraffe — he leans forward, his arms
dangling back and forth. And he likes to
dress up, but not overdress, in big-cuffed
pants and sweaters and three-inch platform
shoes. He relaxes on the music of Brain
Auger, Joni Mitchell and Jethro Tull.
Sure he's got an eye on either law or
business school, but his prevailing attitude is
just "to let things happen. ... I have no idea
where I'll be in five years, but hopefully I'll
have been in a few places," he says.
Misleading Expressions
Often called the varsity's sixth man
because he's usually the first substitute to
enter a game, Trobbe maintains that his
carefree expression is sometimes misleading.
"It appears as though there's a lack of
emotion and interest in my facial expression,
but in my mind I'm going over the game and
concentrating hard on little items that will
help me," he says. "It's useless to show
[outwardly] too much emotion."
Maybe Scott's cool nature helps account
for some of the pressure shots he's made over
the past two seasons. Like the big rebound
shot that upset USF with only a few seconds
remaining in the first overtime period last
December. And three key baskets near the
end of the USC game in Los Angeles last
March that highlighted another upset. And
the jumper from the top of the key which
helped defeat Cal in Harmon Gym last
season.
Overall though, this season has been
somewhat disappointing for Scott, who has
averaged only 3.0 points a game after having
averaged 4.0 last season and 11.5 as a starting
forward on the powerful 1971-72 freshman

team.
Coach Howie Dallmar suggests that "what
Scott needs most is confidence. He's
somewhat of a streak shooter. With more
confidence, he'll be more consistent."
Two Positions
Dallmar adds that Scott's concentration
and ability to settle down have suffered
because of having to play two positions —
guard as well as forward. Dallmar explains
Scott's value: "there are times when we
might need help at forward in one half, and
at guard in the next half due to other men
getting in foul trouble, having a bad night or

needing a rest."
But "it's not easy to play at both guard
and forward," notes Dallmar, especially
because "he's never played at guard before
this year."
And it's even more difficult when coming
off the bench, Scott points out. Because of
the team's many strong reserves and
Dallmar's tactic of frequent substitution,
Scott says he felt more reluctant to shoot
earlier in the season because "I was afraid
that if I missed, I'd come out right away. I
was beginning to worry about playing time
and wasn't concentrating on my shots."
Since the team has begun to run and shoot
more, he says his confidence has improved.
His 17 points two weeks ago up in
Washington will attest to that.
Trobbe has always been a streak shooter,
though this year he has not taken enough
shots to enjoy the once-a-game streak to
which he was accustomed as a freshman. His
rafter-reaching shots at Maples last year
against UCLA, against whom he has always
played well, kept the Cards in the game
during the first half.
Bizarre Style
In addition to having difficulties in
playing two positions and coming off the
bench, Scott has had to endure the
inconsistency resulting from his attempt to
alter his slightly bizarre jump shot.
A right-handed shooter, he holds the ball
over his left shoulder just before release. It's
a style he could use in high school when
"there was no one tall enough to block my #
shots," but which he has tried to alter in
college to a more over-the-head shot.
Dallmar hopes that the adjustment Scott
makes will particularly improve his free
throw percentage, which at .360 is among the
lowest on the team.
Though he has suffered through a weak
shooting year, Trobbe's defensive play has
improved considerably. Assistant coach Bub
Bowling says "we like to use Scott
particularly in man-to-man defense because
of his quickness and mobility" for a man his
size. Scott showed true defensive brilliance
when he blocked two shots by USF star Phil
Smith near the end of the Cards December
victory over the Dons, and when he
effectively shut off UCLA's Keith Wilkes at
Pauley Pavilion last year.
And he'll be out there against the Bruins
tomorrow night. Watch him. If he scores the
winning basket, he may just crack a mellow
smile.
