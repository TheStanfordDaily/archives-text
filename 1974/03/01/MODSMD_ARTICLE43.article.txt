U.S., Egypt R C8utile Relations
CAIRO, Egypi — Proclaiming "a new era,"
President Anwar Sadat announced yesterday that
he is resuming full diplomatic relations with the
United States and inviting President Nixon to visit
Egypt.
He added that Arab oil ministers will meet this
month to decide whether to lift the oil embargo
against the United States.
With Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger at his
side, Sadat declared to newsmen: "As long as Dr.
Kissinger is handling the whole thing, everything is
okay."
The American secretary was in Cairo to confer
with Sadat on, among other Middle East topics,
efforts to arrange negotiations between Israel and
Syria on disengagement of their Golan Heights
forces.
Asked whether recent progress in getting the
Syrians and Israelis together enabled him to give
Kissinger cause for optimism on an end to the oil
embargo, Sadat replied:
"The oil ministers will be meeting in March and
they will take the decision. It is not my decision. It
is the decision of all the Arabs."
The main leader of the Arab oil boycott is Saudi
Arabia, a strongly Moslem country whose King
Faisal has insisted that Arabs must regain the Golan

Heights and East Jerusalem before turning the oil
spigots back on.
Rebel Police Hold Argentine City
CORDOBA, Argentina — Rebel police holding
the Cordoba governor hostage controlled the streets
of this paralyzed city yesterday with no sign of
action by federal forces flown in to calm the
uprising.
President Juan D. Peron met with Interior
Minister Benito Llambi at the presidential palace in
Buenos Aires, 450 miles southeast of Cordoba, in an
effort to defuse the crisis.
But Peron. gave his 250 federal police envoys no
immediate orders to move in against the 800
provincial policemen who revolted Wednesday night
and took over Cordoba, Argentina's second-largest
city.
The provincial police rebelled after Gov. Ricardo
Obregon Cano fired provincial Police Chief Antonio
Navarro in a local eruption of the nationwide
dispute between the left and right wings of the
Peronist movement.
Coal Miners Continue Shutdown
CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Some 17,000 southern
West Virginia coal miners continued a work boycott
yesterday in protest of short gasoline supplies as
their union leaders sought state government aid.
Most mines in southeastern Virginia were open
yesterday as emergency gasoline supplies flowed
into the area, but absenteeism remained high, mine
owners said.
The movement in West Virginia that has cost
steel mills and utilities more than 175,000 tons of
coal daily began Monday in McDowell County with
miners simply staying away from work because,
they contended, they couldn't get enough gasoline
to drive to work.
The association also said that while miners
claimed they couldn't get to work, there was no
unusual absenteeism among office and supervisory
staff members.
Nixon Plans Energy Bill Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon said
yesterday the United States is not going to have
gasoline rationing and announced he will veto the
emergency energy bill passed by Congress.
"That bill will result in longer gas lines and also
would inevitably lead to compulsory rationing in
this country, and that we are not going to have, and
we should not have," Nixon said.
It was the most unequivocal statement yet by the
President that there won't be any rationing. At a

news conference Monday night, he had said chances
were much better than 50-50 there would be no
rationing, and he had said earlier he wanted to avoid
rationing if possible.
The aspect of the bill most objected to by the
White House would roll crude oil prices back to
$5.25 a barrel but would permit increases back to
$7.09, which is still lower than some current prices.
Free Food Reaches 30,000 People
SAN FRANCISCO — As many as 30,000 persons
streamed through food banks yesterday to pick up
bags of free groceries in the mass giveaway designed
to break the silence of Patricia Hearst's terrorist
kidnapers.
Under leaden skies and heavy rain, The People in
Need operation went smoothly and without any of
the confusion and violence that marred the start of
the $2 million program last Friday.
The anxious father, Randolph A. Hearst, said he
hoped the handout would bring about negotiations
for his daughter's release.
"That's what we're hoping for," Hearst said
through a spokesman. "God knows, we're hoping."
GOP Gubernatorial Bids Filed
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke and
State Controller Houston Flournoy both officially
jumped into the Republican race for governor
yesterday.
Flournoy filed his formal declaration of
candidacy at the Los Angeles County
Registrar-Recorders Office and Reinecke filed his
declaration document at the Sacramento County
Clerk's office.
Included in the list of official Flournoy sponsors
in the June 4 GOP primary was former U.S. Sen.
Thomas Kuchel.
Reinecke said he hoped to get support from
Henry Salvatori, a wealthy Los Angeles industrialist
who was one of Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan's
earliest supporters.
"I have talked with Henry and he is sympathetic
to my candidacy. I feel very confident we can have
his support at some future time," Reinecke told
reporters.
He admitted he was worried about voter reaction
to an investigation of him in connection with an
International Telephone and Telegraph antitrust
case.

U.S., Egypt R C8utile Relations
CAIRO, Egypi — Proclaiming "a new era,"
President Anwar Sadat announced yesterday that
he is resuming full diplomatic relations with the
United States and inviting President Nixon to visit
Egypt.
He added that Arab oil ministers will meet this
month to decide whether to lift the oil embargo
against the United States.
With Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger at his
side, Sadat declared to newsmen: "As long as Dr.
Kissinger is handling the whole thing, everything is
okay."
The American secretary was in Cairo to confer
with Sadat on, among other Middle East topics,
efforts to arrange negotiations between Israel and
Syria on disengagement of their Golan Heights
forces.
Asked whether recent progress in getting the
Syrians and Israelis together enabled him to give
Kissinger cause for optimism on an end to the oil
embargo, Sadat replied:
"The oil ministers will be meeting in March and
they will take the decision. It is not my decision. It
is the decision of all the Arabs."
The main leader of the Arab oil boycott is Saudi
Arabia, a strongly Moslem country whose King
Faisal has insisted that Arabs must regain the Golan

Heights and East Jerusalem before turning the oil
spigots back on.
Rebel Police Hold Argentine City
CORDOBA, Argentina — Rebel police holding
the Cordoba governor hostage controlled the streets
of this paralyzed city yesterday with no sign of
action by federal forces flown in to calm the
uprising.
President Juan D. Peron met with Interior
Minister Benito Llambi at the presidential palace in
Buenos Aires, 450 miles southeast of Cordoba, in an
effort to defuse the crisis.
But Peron. gave his 250 federal police envoys no
immediate orders to move in against the 800
provincial policemen who revolted Wednesday night
and took over Cordoba, Argentina's second-largest
city.
The provincial police rebelled after Gov. Ricardo
Obregon Cano fired provincial Police Chief Antonio
Navarro in a local eruption of the nationwide
dispute between the left and right wings of the
Peronist movement.
Coal Miners Continue Shutdown
CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Some 17,000 southern
West Virginia coal miners continued a work boycott
yesterday in protest of short gasoline supplies as
their union leaders sought state government aid.
Most mines in southeastern Virginia were open
yesterday as emergency gasoline supplies flowed
into the area, but absenteeism remained high, mine
owners said.
The movement in West Virginia that has cost
steel mills and utilities more than 175,000 tons of
coal daily began Monday in McDowell County with
miners simply staying away from work because,
they contended, they couldn't get enough gasoline
to drive to work.
The association also said that while miners
claimed they couldn't get to work, there was no
unusual absenteeism among office and supervisory
staff members.
Nixon Plans Energy Bill Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon said
yesterday the United States is not going to have
gasoline rationing and announced he will veto the
emergency energy bill passed by Congress.
"That bill will result in longer gas lines and also
would inevitably lead to compulsory rationing in
this country, and that we are not going to have, and
we should not have," Nixon said.
It was the most unequivocal statement yet by the
President that there won't be any rationing. At a

news conference Monday night, he had said chances
were much better than 50-50 there would be no
rationing, and he had said earlier he wanted to avoid
rationing if possible.
The aspect of the bill most objected to by the
White House would roll crude oil prices back to
$5.25 a barrel but would permit increases back to
$7.09, which is still lower than some current prices.
Free Food Reaches 30,000 People
SAN FRANCISCO — As many as 30,000 persons
streamed through food banks yesterday to pick up
bags of free groceries in the mass giveaway designed
to break the silence of Patricia Hearst's terrorist
kidnapers.
Under leaden skies and heavy rain, The People in
Need operation went smoothly and without any of
the confusion and violence that marred the start of
the $2 million program last Friday.
The anxious father, Randolph A. Hearst, said he
hoped the handout would bring about negotiations
for his daughter's release.
"That's what we're hoping for," Hearst said
through a spokesman. "God knows, we're hoping."

the $2 million program last Friday.
The anxious father, Randolph A. Hearst, said he
hoped the handout would bring about negotiations
for his daughter's release.
"That's what we're hoping for," Hearst said
through a spokesman. "God knows, we're hoping."
GOP Gubernatorial Bids Filed
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke and
State Controller Houston Flournoy both officially
jumped into the Republican race for governor
yesterday.
Flournoy filed his formal declaration of
candidacy at the Los Angeles County
Registrar-Recorders Office and Reinecke filed his
declaration document at the Sacramento County
Clerk's office.
Included in the list of official Flournoy sponsors
in the June 4 GOP primary was former U.S. Sen.
Thomas Kuchel.
Reinecke said he hoped to get support from
Henry Salvatori, a wealthy Los Angeles industrialist
who was one of Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan's
earliest supporters.
"I have talked with Henry and he is sympathetic
to my candidacy. I feel very confident we can have
his support at some future time," Reinecke told
reporters.
He admitted he was worried about voter reaction
to an investigation of him in connection with an
International Telephone and Telegraph antitrust
case.

U.S., Egypt R C8utile Relations
CAIRO, Egypi — Proclaiming "a new era,"
President Anwar Sadat announced yesterday that
he is resuming full diplomatic relations with the
United States and inviting President Nixon to visit
Egypt.
He added that Arab oil ministers will meet this
month to decide whether to lift the oil embargo
against the United States.
With Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger at his
side, Sadat declared to newsmen: "As long as Dr.
Kissinger is handling the whole thing, everything is
okay."
The American secretary was in Cairo to confer
with Sadat on, among other Middle East topics,
efforts to arrange negotiations between Israel and
Syria on disengagement of their Golan Heights
forces.
Asked whether recent progress in getting the
Syrians and Israelis together enabled him to give
Kissinger cause for optimism on an end to the oil
embargo, Sadat replied:
"The oil ministers will be meeting in March and
they will take the decision. It is not my decision. It
is the decision of all the Arabs."
The main leader of the Arab oil boycott is Saudi
Arabia, a strongly Moslem country whose King
Faisal has insisted that Arabs must regain the Golan

Heights and East Jerusalem before turning the oil
spigots back on.
Rebel Police Hold Argentine City
CORDOBA, Argentina — Rebel police holding
the Cordoba governor hostage controlled the streets
of this paralyzed city yesterday with no sign of
action by federal forces flown in to calm the
uprising.
President Juan D. Peron met with Interior
Minister Benito Llambi at the presidential palace in
Buenos Aires, 450 miles southeast of Cordoba, in an
effort to defuse the crisis.
But Peron. gave his 250 federal police envoys no
immediate orders to move in against the 800
provincial policemen who revolted Wednesday night
and took over Cordoba, Argentina's second-largest
city.
The provincial police rebelled after Gov. Ricardo
Obregon Cano fired provincial Police Chief Antonio
Navarro in a local eruption of the nationwide
dispute between the left and right wings of the
Peronist movement.
Coal Miners Continue Shutdown
CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Some 17,000 southern
West Virginia coal miners continued a work boycott
yesterday in protest of short gasoline supplies as
their union leaders sought state government aid.
Most mines in southeastern Virginia were open
yesterday as emergency gasoline supplies flowed
into the area, but absenteeism remained high, mine
owners said.
The movement in West Virginia that has cost
steel mills and utilities more than 175,000 tons of
coal daily began Monday in McDowell County with
miners simply staying away from work because,
they contended, they couldn't get enough gasoline
to drive to work.
The association also said that while miners
claimed they couldn't get to work, there was no
unusual absenteeism among office and supervisory
staff members.
Nixon Plans Energy Bill Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon said
yesterday the United States is not going to have
gasoline rationing and announced he will veto the
emergency energy bill passed by Congress.
"That bill will result in longer gas lines and also
would inevitably lead to compulsory rationing in
this country, and that we are not going to have, and
we should not have," Nixon said.
It was the most unequivocal statement yet by the
President that there won't be any rationing. At a

news conference Monday night, he had said chances
were much better than 50-50 there would be no
rationing, and he had said earlier he wanted to avoid
rationing if possible.
The aspect of the bill most objected to by the
White House would roll crude oil prices back to
$5.25 a barrel but would permit increases back to
$7.09, which is still lower than some current prices.
Free Food Reaches 30,000 People
SAN FRANCISCO — As many as 30,000 persons
streamed through food banks yesterday to pick up
bags of free groceries in the mass giveaway designed
to break the silence of Patricia Hearst's terrorist
kidnapers.
Under leaden skies and heavy rain, The People in
Need operation went smoothly and without any of
the confusion and violence that marred the start of
the $2 million program last Friday.
The anxious father, Randolph A. Hearst, said he
