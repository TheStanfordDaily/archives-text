# Stanford-Berkeley Bus Cuts Back Service
## 
### 
The East Bay Commute Club will no longer be
able to transport Stanford students from the
University to Berkeley unless they are daily
commuters, according to Virginia Peterson, a
representative of the club.
Although the club has allowed anyone to ride its
chartered bus since the club's formation eight years
ago, the energy crisis has caused the bus to become
overcrowded, Peterson said.
"We used to have 20 or 30 people riding the bus
every day," Peterson explained. "Now we have 50
or 60 people riding it each day."
Approximately ten Stanford students ride the
bus every Friday evening, she stated.
"I don't want to have .to turn them away,"
Peterson said. "But we simply don't have room. I
hope to be able to accomodate them in a few weeks
when the gasoline shortage becomes less severe."
The three or four Stanford students who live in
Berkeley and commute to Stanford each day will
not be affected by the restriction on the number of
passengers, Peterson said.
The bus travels from Berkeley to Palo Alto each
weekday morning and leaves Stanford for Berkeley
five days a week at 6 p.m.
