# Frenchman's Terrace
## Palo Alto May Deny Annexation 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council might
refuse to annex the University's
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project, according to Vice
Mayor Enid Pearson.
"The project will create many
problems," Pearson said. "I can't help
but feel that the University is trying to
shuck Frenchman's Terrace off on us
because Stanford knows that the
project will cause problems."
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225 acre
unit housing project for low and
moderate income Palo Alto residents
would be built on Stanford land and
managed by the Urban Coalition. The
University has asked Palo Alto to
annex the 20 acres on which it would

be built, claiming that the city could
better provide municipal services for
the project.
Pearson claimed that the Terrace
would aggravate the traffic burden in
nearby College Terrace.
Pearson stated that she will
probably oppose annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace region until
Stanford gives up one third of an acre
of land at the corner of Stanford
Avenue and Bowdoin. Annexation of
the third of an acre would allow Palo
Alto to construct a road between
Amherst and Bowdoin across Stanford
Avenue. Pearson insists that such a
road would reduce traffic in College
Terrace.
Robert Augsburger, University vice

president for business and finance,
contends that giving up the land would
slice the greenbelts built by the
University along Stanford Avenue.
The University will not give up the
land at the corner of Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin because Stanford has
spent a considerable sum of money to
construct greenbelts in the region,
Augsburger explained.
Pearson insisted that the greenbelts
at Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin are
wider than those at other places, and a
rather wide greenbelt would be
retained even if the proposed road
were built.
Furthermore, there is no proof that
the proposed road would reduce
traffic in the Terrace, Augsburger
stated. Traffic engineers have claimed
that such a road would not solve the
College Terrace traffic problem, he
noted.
Precedent Setting
Augsburger said that if the
University yielded in this instance, it
might be asked to give up more land at
a future time. It is better never to start
giving land away, he stated.
"When Stanford and Palo Alto
compromise on an issue, it is always
Palo Alto that loses," Pearson said. "I
want to hold out this time."
Pearson especially expressed
opposition to the community center
planned for the project. "The idea of
having a community center is
ridiculous," Pearson said. "It is a waste
of space and money. There are plenty
of community social and cultural
facilities on the Stanford campus and
Palo Alto."
However, Pearson emphasized that
her main reason for opposing a
community center is that it might
keep Frenchman's Terrace residents
from integrating themselves into the
local community.
Augsburger called the community
center a "very desirable thing." He

pointed out that it would include a
day care center which would be
beneficial to the residents of the
housing project.
"It is desirable also that
Frenchman's Terrace residents
integrate themselves into the
surrounding community," Augsburger
said. "But I can see no reason why a
community center would prevent that
from occurring."
