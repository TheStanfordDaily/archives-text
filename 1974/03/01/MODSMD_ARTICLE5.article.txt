# Frenchman's Terrace
## Palo Alto May Deny Annexation 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Palo Alto City Council might
refuse to annex the University's
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project, according to Vice
Mayor Enid Pearson.
"The project will create many
problems," Pearson said. "I can't help
but feel that the University is trying to
shuck Frenchman's Terrace off on us
because Stanford knows that the
project will cause problems."
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225 acre
unit housing project for low and
moderate income Palo Alto residents
would be built on Stanford land and
managed by the Urban Coalition. The
University has asked Palo Alto to
annex the 20 acres on which it would

be built, claiming that the city could
better provide municipal services for
the project.
Pearson claimed that the Terrace
would aggravate the traffic burden in
nearby College Terrace.
Pearson stated that she will
probably oppose annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace region until
Stanford gives up one third of an acre
of land at the corner of Stanford
Avenue and Bowdoin. Annexation of
the third of an acre would allow Palo
Alto to construct a road between
Amherst and Bowdoin across Stanford
Avenue. Pearson insists that such a
road would reduce traffic in College
Terrace.
Robert Augsburger, University vice

president for business and finance,
contends that giving up the land would
slice the greenbelts built by the
University along Stanford Avenue.
The University will not give up the
land at the corner of Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin because Stanford has
spent a considerable sum of money to
construct greenbelts in the region,
Augsburger explained.
Pearson insisted that the greenbelts
at Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin are
wider than those at other places, and a
rather wide greenbelt would be
retained even if the proposed road
were built.
Furthermore, there is no proof that
the proposed road would reduce
