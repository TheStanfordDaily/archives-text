# Computer-Tutor Stimulates Student Achievement

First-grader Tommie Williams sits down at the
teletypewriter and pecks out his number, R452, and his
first name. He pauses for a moment and the machine
responds by completing his name.
"Hi. Welcome to reading," says the machine, "speaking"
through the earphones that Tommie wears.
Tommie, along with over 200 other kindergarten
through third graders at Brentwood Elementary School in
East Palo Alto, is learning to read with the assistance of a
computer with a voice.
The computer system, developed by Prof. Richard
Atkinson, chairman of the Psychology Dept., is unique in
three ways, according to Atkinson's research assistant, Olin
Campbell.
The first is the audio aspect of the computer.
"Obviously, you can't print out some instructions and ask a
kid to read them if you're trying to teach him to read,"
Campbell commented. The answer has been to analyze
speech and convert different components into digits. The
computer stores these digits and can recall and recompose
various words and phrases when necessary.
Uses Learning Theory
Another unique aspect of the program is that it
"incorporates a lot of research on learning theory," said
Campbell. This learning optimization is designed to
maximize the amount a student learns in a given amount of
time.
The third unusual aspect of the program is its complete
individualization. After the computer recognized Tommie
Williams by typing in his last name, for example, it checked
Tommie's past performance record, which lesson he had
finished the day before, and in what order the lessons
would be presented that day.
"The student doesn't have to stand up and make a fool
of himself in class," said Campbell. "We have all kinds of
rein forcers — claps and cheers and 'groovys' and 'fantastics.
That's one of the nice aspects of audio — that we can say

that rather than type it out."
Students 'Enthusiastic'
Almost all of the students seem enthusiastic about the
computer-tutor — they head straight for the terminals when
they enter the building that houses the system. However,
there have been a few problems.
Campbell cited the case of a girl who was frightened by
the computer. After the girl's older sister, who was also on
the computer assisted instructional program, reassured her,
the young girl soon lost her fear.
Positive Results
The computer program's positive results, are evidenced
by test scores published in 1972. In a study reported in the
Journal of Educational Psychology, students who used the
computer assisted instruction for five months gained five
months of reading ability over their control counterparts.
Furthermore, this difference persisted through the next
year, when neither group received computer assistance.
The reading program uses seven strands, or types of
lessons, to teach the students to read. Five of these strands
are in the area of decoding. In this stage, according to
Campbell, the student learns to look at a word and say it.
The decoding strands include letter identification,
sight-word recognition, spelling patterns, phonics, and
spelling comprehension.
The next step is communication, or "everything else that
we know of as 'reading,' " said Campbell. In this stage the
students learn word and sentence comprehension.
The lesson strands are tailored to each student's needs
and abilities. Depending on his other strong or weak points,
the student can review or skip certain lessons.
When a strand is finished, the computer types out the
student's test results — for example, "Tommie, you have
answered 80 percent correctly."
At the end of each computer session, a print out appears
of all the strands that the student passed that day. Teachers
regularly receive comprehensive printouts that show scores
for their entire classes.

ABC BY COMPUTER- Two Palo Alto third graders examine a computer that is teaching them to read. The audio
computer system is being used to help more than 200 students in Palo Alto schools to improve their reading skills. Studies
show that pupils who learn by computer are more proficient in verbal skills than students who acquire their knowledge
through more traditional methods.
