## Media Criticism 
### 
A newspaper always has the upper hand in any debate
with its readers, and editors often have to restrain
themselves from replying to a four-sentence letter with a
20-inch editorial.
Nevertheless, we find some recent letters and comments
critical of the media — here and elsewhere — somewhat
disturbing. Our concern is not that the media is being
criticized — a vigorous, critical debate over quality is healthy
for both the media and the public — but the reasons for that
criticism.
It bothers us that some readers would prefer not to be
alarmed or disturbed by facts they find distasteful. And they
sometimes blame the media for not sheltering them and
protecting them from those facts.
Even some of our own readers seem to sometimes take
this approach. If they don't care for another group's
lifestyle, or sexual habits, or politics, they'd simply rather
not hear about them.
We don't see it that way. Newspapers ought to be
dedicated to printing the news — the good, the bad and the
indifferent. And like it or not, stories about social habits in
the fraternities, or the kind of information being
disseminated by the University, are news, just as stories
about the death of a student or an award won by a Stanford
professor are news.
The fact that we print a story does not mean we approve
of the statements or trends reflected in it. In fact, much of
the material that appears in the Daily probably alarms us
just as much as it alarms you, if not more.
But we don't feel that just because we don't approve of
something, we can hide it. Pretending it isn't there won't
make it disappear.
In a community where the search for knowledge is the
one common denominator, ignorance has no place. It would
be fatal for students to fall for the same easy argument that
is resulting in sugar-coated news media elsewhere.
