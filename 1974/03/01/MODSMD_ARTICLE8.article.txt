'Lunatic Obsession'
Editor:
Daniel Bershader's response to
a letter by Lise Giraud, in the
Daily of Feb. 25, objected to
Giraud's "presumption of military
expertise relating to our
submarine launched missile
systems." Giraud had pointed out
that the U.S. government is
planning to spend $50 billion on
the Trident missile, "whose only
purpose is to kill and which
effectively adds little to the
capacity we already have for
eliminating all life on earth."
Prof. Bershader's suggestion
that nuclear policy should be left
to the experts is a chilling one.
The Polaris-Poseidon fleet has
already cost $30 billion. A single
Poseidon, armed with 160 nuclear
weapons, could effectively
destroy all of Europe, and each
new Trident will be equipped with
more than 240 nuclear weapons.
We are already able to destroy
Russia — or China — in a quarter
of an hour. To spend billions
increasing our ability to destroy
the world indicates a lunatic
obsession — either with killing, or
with profit making, or both.
Expertise is essential to
developing nuclear technology but
has nothing to do with the values
necessary for human survival. It
was experts who said we had to
send half a million U.S. troops to
Vietnam. Military experts, finding
an ideal testing ground, provided
the napalm, the "anti-personnel
devices," the hundred million
pounds of defoliants, ana the
seven million tons of bombs that
have left Indochina a social and
ecological ruin.
In her letter Giraud expressed
deep concern for Patricia Hearst
and her family. But she lamented
the fact that our national concern
does not also extend to those
millions of human beings who
continue to suffer terror and
death at the ands of the U.S.
government and its allies. It does
not take military expertise to
value life over death. Quite the
contrary.

Rabid Bats
Editor:
I would like to correct several
of the statements quoted in the
Feb. 25 article by William Ross,
"Lonely Bat Finds UGLY Perch."
(1) The bat in UGLY Saturday
night swooped down, at people
before two students were
observed throwing things at it.
(2) The July 5, 1973 issue of
Campus Report carried a story
stating that three rabid bats had
bten found on campus(two in
June and one in February). There
is a large probability that they had
infected other bats on campus.
In fact, in«this same article a
memo circulated to all
departments by Wilson is quoted
as saying, "Since our buildings
provide excellent nesting for bats,
it is imperative that everyone at
Stanford be cautious around any
bat." He is quoted in the Daily
article as saying, "Since they [the
bats] are no threat to the people
of Stanford, there is no reason to
kill them." I think this represents
a somewhat dramatic change in
attitude.
(3) From first-hand experience
working with bats I know that
Wilson's statement about rabid
bats dying rather quickly is
incorrect. I have seen them live
longer than the four day period
discussed in the article
(Wednesday-Saturday night). I
was also told by Dr. James
Simmons of the Princeton
Auditory Lab, who was in charge
of the bat project on which I
worked in Panama, that rabid bats
can live for several months.
(4) Mr. Wilson's statement
about bats biting only people who
attack them is also incorrect.
There are documented cases to
the contrary. One involved a
young boy who was bitten by a
rabid bat while asleep.
(5) As one who was bitten, by
not merely a bat, but a rabid bat
and underwent one year of
treatment for it, I am well aware
of the danger of a possibly rabid
bat. This and the lack of action on
the part of the authorities
concerned were what prompted
me to contact the Daily in the
first place.

Daniel Bershader's response to
a letter by Lise Giraud, in the
Daily of Feb. 25, objected to
Giraud's "presumption of military
expertise relating to our
submarine launched missile
systems." Giraud had pointed out
that the U.S. government is
planning to spend $50 billion on
the Trident missile, "whose only
purpose is to kill and which
effectively adds little to the
capacity we already have for
eliminating all life on earth."
Prof. Bershader's suggestion
that nuclear policy should be left
to the experts is a chilling one.
The Polaris-Poseidon fleet has
already cost $30 billion. A single
Poseidon, armed with 160 nuclear
weapons, could effectively
destroy all of Europe, and each
new Trident will be equipped with
more than 240 nuclear weapons.
We are already able to destroy
Russia — or China — in a quarter
of an hour. To spend billions
increasing our ability to destroy
the world indicates a lunatic
obsession — either with killing, or
with profit making, or both.
Expertise is essential to
developing nuclear technology but
has nothing to do with the values
necessary for human survival. It
was experts who said we had to
send half a million U.S. troops to
Vietnam. Military experts, finding
an ideal testing ground, provided
the napalm, the "anti-personnel
devices," the hundred million
pounds of defoliants, ana the
seven million tons of bombs that
have left Indochina a social and
ecological ruin.
In her letter Giraud expressed
deep concern for Patricia Hearst
and her family. But she lamented
the fact that our national concern
does not also extend to those
millions of human beings who
continue to suffer terror and
death at the ands of the U.S.
government and its allies. It does
not take military expertise to
value life over death. Quite the
contrary.

Rabid Bats
Editor:
I would like to correct several
of the statements quoted in the
Feb. 25 article by William Ross,
"Lonely Bat Finds UGLY Perch."
(1) The bat in UGLY Saturday
night swooped down, at people
before two students were
observed throwing things at it.
(2) The July 5, 1973 issue of
Campus Report carried a story
stating that three rabid bats had
bten found on campus(two in
June and one in February). There
is a large probability that they had
infected other bats on campus.
In fact, in«this same article a
memo circulated to all
departments by Wilson is quoted
as saying, "Since our buildings
provide excellent nesting for bats,
it is imperative that everyone at
Stanford be cautious around any
bat." He is quoted in the Daily
article as saying, "Since they [the
bats] are no threat to the people
of Stanford, there is no reason to
kill them." I think this represents
a somewhat dramatic change in
attitude.
(3) From first-hand experience
working with bats I know that
Wilson's statement about rabid
bats dying rather quickly is
incorrect. I have seen them live
longer than the four day period
discussed in the article
(Wednesday-Saturday night). I
was also told by Dr. James
Simmons of the Princeton
Auditory Lab, who was in charge
of the bat project on which I
