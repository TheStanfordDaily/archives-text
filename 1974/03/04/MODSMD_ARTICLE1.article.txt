# Golda Meir Announces Resignation
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Premier
Goida Meir announced yesterday she
was resigning as head of the Israeli
government, leaving the nation
floundering without a clear successor.
The 75-year-old leader, exhausted
by events of the October Middle East
war and strained by two months of
political struggle to form a new
cabinet, made the stunning
announcement at a closed meeting of
her Labor party executives, Transport
Minister Shimon Peres said.
Meir left the meeting red-eyed
among shouts from supporters urging
her to stay in power.
Observers said there was a slim
chance she might remain in office, but
it was doubtful a government could be
formed which she would agree to lead.
"I have tried to serve to the best of
my ability," the state radio quoted
Meir as saying. But she added: "It
would have been better if I had
resigned in August or September" —
before the October Middle East war.
Adamant Refusal
In late-night contacts with party
leaders, Meir reportedly remained
adamant in her refusal to head the
next government.
President Ephraim Katzir could
appoint another Labor party leader to
hammer out a new coalition, which
could pick Meir as prime minister.
Labor party officials doubted the
premier's announced resignation was a
tactic to reunite her divided party.
"It's too early to tell exactly what
Golda has on her mind," said one
political veteran, "but it sounds like
she means it."
'Final Decision'
"This is my final decision," Peres
quoted her as declaring. Peres said "it
would take a political miracle" to
persuade Meir to remain in office.
Meir's resignation — after almost
five years as head of the government —
came 48 hours after her latest round
of secret talk- with Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger on a truce with
Syria.
The Russian-born, American-reared
premier stays on as leader of the
government until a successor presents
a new cabinet to the Knesset, or
parliament.
Weaken Government
Analysts said her walkout, and the
divisions it was bound to deepen in the
Labor alignment, inevitably would
weaken the next government in
dealing with the Arabs.
"We are in a very deep crisis," a
Labor party official said.
The announcement came two
weeks after Defense Minister Moshe
Dayan, angry at party and public
criticism over his leadership in the
October war, threw the Labor
alignment into turmoil by refusing to
join the new government.
Possible Successors
Neither the party nor ministers of
the present caretaker cabinet indicated
who might take over as premier. One
of Meir's aides speculated that in the
complicated political maneuvering
Dayan could emerge as the new
government leader.
Traditionally regarded as chief
candidates to succeed Meir Finance
Minister Pinhas Sapir, Deputy Premier
Yigal Allon or Foreign Minister Abba
Eban. But political observers said her
resignation could lead to the
formation of a national unity
government with the right wing
opposition.

premier stays on as leader of the
government until a successor presents
a new cabinet to the Knesset, or
parliament.
Weaken Government
Analysts said her walkout, and the
divisions it was bound to deepen in the
Labor alignment, inevitably would
weaken the next government in
dealing with the Arabs.
"We are in a very deep crisis," a
Labor party official said.
The announcement came two
weeks after Defense Minister Moshe
Dayan, angry at party and public
criticism over his leadership in the
October war, threw the Labor
alignment into turmoil by refusing to
join the new government.
Possible Successors
Neither the party nor ministers of
the present caretaker cabinet indicated
who might take over as premier. One
of Meir's aides speculated that in the
complicated political maneuvering
Dayan could emerge as the new
government leader.
Traditionally regarded as chief
candidates to succeed Meir Finance
Minister Pinhas Sapir, Deputy Premier
Yigal Allon or Foreign Minister Abba
Eban. But political observers said her
resignation could lead to the
formation of a national unity
government with the right wing
opposition.
JERUSALEM (AP) — Premier
Goida Meir announced yesterday she
was resigning as head of the Israeli
government, leaving the nation
floundering without a clear successor.
The 75-year-old leader, exhausted
by events of the October Middle East
war and strained by two months of
political struggle to form a new
cabinet, made the stunning
announcement at a closed meeting of
her Labor party executives, Transport
Minister Shimon Peres said.
Meir left the meeting red-eyed
among shouts from supporters urging
her to stay in power.
Observers said there was a slim
chance she might remain in office, but
it was doubtful a government could be
formed which she would agree to lead.
"I have tried to serve to the best of
my ability," the state radio quoted
Meir as saying. But she added: "It
would have been better if I had
resigned in August or September" —
before the October Middle East war.
Adamant Refusal
In late-night contacts with party
leaders, Meir reportedly remained
adamant in her refusal to head the
next government.
President Ephraim Katzir could
appoint another Labor party leader to
hammer out a new coalition, which
could pick Meir as prime minister.
Labor party officials doubted the
premier's announced resignation was a
tactic to reunite her divided party.
"It's too early to tell exactly what
Golda has on her mind," said one
political veteran, "but it sounds like
she means it."
'Final Decision'
"This is my final decision," Peres
quoted her as declaring. Peres said "it
would take a political miracle" to
persuade Meir to remain in office.
Meir's resignation — after almost
five years as head of the government —
came 48 hours after her latest round
of secret talk- with Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger on a truce with
Syria.
