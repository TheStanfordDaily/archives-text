# Impeachment: Counterproductive?

It seems ironic that the very people who
are advocating the impeachment of President
Nixon tend to be the individuals whose
interests would be least served by his removal
from office.
Although I have never supported most of
Nixon's policies and am as disgusted as
anyone by the Watergate revelations, I
question the value of impeaching and
convicting the President.
Certainly the conviction of Nixon by the
Senate would be a great moral victory for
those who believe that high office should
involve public responsibility. But one must
look beyond the act of removing Nixon from
office and examine the practical
consequences that such an event would
probably engender.
If Nixon left office, he would be replaced
by a man whose rhetoric implies that the
affairs of the nation are no more important
than those of a football game. Gerald Ford's
style could be forgiven if his substance were
of higher quality, but unfortunately this is
not so.
Ford's record is largely the same as
Nixon's. He has distinguished himself as an
opponent of progressive measures. Ford
voted against plans for conservation while in
the House and opposed social welfare
programs such as workmen's compensation

for migratory laborers. He favored the SST
and ABM and functioned as an apologist for
Nixon's Indochina policies.
Clearly, the interests of the liberal forces
in America hardly would be served by Ford's
elevation to the Presidency. It is true that
Ford might be a weak leader who would
yield authority to Congress, but if the Senate
can convict Nixon, it can override his vetoes
and render him powerless. Both conviction
and veto require a two-thirds vote. While
impeachment takes only a majority of House
votes, if it could impeach Nixon, it should be
able to muster the votes to override his
vetoes. A return to a strong Congress isn't
contingent upon Nixon's removal from
office.
Furthermore, it seems evident that the
President will be in no position to allow
Watergate-type activities to recrudesce. After
his enervation by the admirable efforts of the
Watergate investigators, even Nixon would
not dare to resume his former tactics.
Worst of all, Nixon's conviction would
allow Ford to seek the Presidency as an
incumbent in 1976. Although Ford has
indicated that he won't be a candidate, this
means nothing. As an incumbent, Ford
would be virtually assured of his party's
nomination, thereby crushing the hopes of

moderate Republicans who desire to reform
the GOP. As President, Ford would enjoy
immense advantages over his Democratic
opponent. Indeed, it would seem that the
very best way to insure a continuance of
Nixonian policies into 1981 would be to
make Ford President in 1974.
Although some would argue that since
Nixon has committed criminal acts he thus
deserves to be impeached no matter what the
effect, I must point out that Ford has
defended Nixon far more than is necessary. It
would not be proper for Ford to call for
Nixon's impeachment, but the vice president
has certainly defended Nixon more than is
necessary. I find his dismissal of anti-Nixon
partisans as a small group of radicals to be
particularly extreme.
Nixon deserves to be removed from office.
But after examining the probable
consequences both of his continuance as
President and of his removal from office, I
find it difficult to decide whether he should
indeed be impeached and convicted. People
who genuinely oppose what Nixon represents
should carefully consider the consequences
of his removal from office before asserting
themselves in favor of impeachment.

probably engender.
If Nixon left office, he would be replaced
by a man whose rhetoric implies that the
affairs of the nation are no more important
than those of a football game. Gerald Ford's
style could be forgiven if his substance were
of higher quality, but unfortunately this is
not so.
Ford's record is largely the same as
Nixon's. He has distinguished himself as an
opponent of progressive measures. Ford
voted against plans for conservation while in
the House and opposed social welfare
programs such as workmen's compensation

for migratory laborers. He favored the SST
and ABM and functioned as an apologist for
Nixon's Indochina policies.
Clearly, the interests of the liberal forces
in America hardly would be served by Ford's
elevation to the Presidency. It is true that
Ford might be a weak leader who would
yield authority to Congress, but if the Senate
can convict Nixon, it can override his vetoes
and render him powerless. Both conviction
and veto require a two-thirds vote. While
impeachment takes only a majority of House
votes, if it could impeach Nixon, it should be
able to muster the votes to override his
vetoes. A return to a strong Congress isn't
contingent upon Nixon's removal from
office.
Furthermore, it seems evident that the
President will be in no position to allow
Watergate-type activities to recrudesce. After
his enervation by the admirable efforts of the
Watergate investigators, even Nixon would
not dare to resume his former tactics.
Worst of all, Nixon's conviction would
allow Ford to seek the Presidency as an
incumbent in 1976. Although Ford has
indicated that he won't be a candidate, this
means nothing. As an incumbent, Ford
would be virtually assured of his party's
nomination, thereby crushing the hopes of

moderate Republicans who desire to reform
the GOP. As President, Ford would enjoy
immense advantages over his Democratic
opponent. Indeed, it would seem that the
very best way to insure a continuance of
Nixonian policies into 1981 would be to
make Ford President in 1974.
Although some would argue that since
Nixon has committed criminal acts he thus
deserves to be impeached no matter what the
effect, I must point out that Ford has
defended Nixon far more than is necessary. It
would not be proper for Ford to call for
Nixon's impeachment, but the vice president
has certainly defended Nixon more than is
necessary. I find his dismissal of anti-Nixon
partisans as a small group of radicals to be
particularly extreme.
Nixon deserves to be removed from office.
But after examining the probable
consequences both of his continuance as
President and of his removal from office, I
find it difficult to decide whether he should
indeed be impeached and convicted. People
who genuinely oppose what Nixon represents
should carefully consider the consequences
of his removal from office before asserting
themselves in favor of impeachment.

It seems ironic that the very people who
are advocating the impeachment of President
Nixon tend to be the individuals whose
interests would be least served by his removal
from office.
Although I have never supported most of
Nixon's policies and am as disgusted as
anyone by the Watergate revelations, I
question the value of impeaching and
convicting the President.
Certainly the conviction of Nixon by the
Senate would be a great moral victory for
those who believe that high office should
involve public responsibility. But one must
look beyond the act of removing Nixon from
office and examine the practical
consequences that such an event would
probably engender.
