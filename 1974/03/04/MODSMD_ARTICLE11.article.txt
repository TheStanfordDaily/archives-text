# Arms Control And Disarmament

Bill Evers' attempt (Daily Feb.
28) to elucidate some of the
problems of national defense,
nuclear strategy, deterrence, and
disarmament presently being
discussed at high levels of
government is an oversimplified
treatment of an extremely
complex subject. As such, it
inevitably fails to elucidate
anything.
Evers paints a picture of the
strategy debate in black-and-white
terms. It can hardly be done.
Many feel that the Mutually
Assured Destruction posture
(MAD) described by Evers does
not preclude some role for a
counterforce capability.
The two are mutually
exclusive; nevertheless, an honest
treatment of the subject would
have included Henry Kissinger's
thoughts on the subject, which are
directly to this point. Kissinger at
least partially accepts MAD
posture while at the same time
advocating a limited counterforce
posture.
The debate which is going on
right now is not primarily
between two extremes, but
between varying shades of grey. A
major question is whether
targetting one's nuclear warheads
on the opponent's industrial
capacity destabilizes the nuclear
balance the same way targetting
them on his land-based missiles
does. There are no clear-cut
answers to questions such as
these, and this frustrates Evers
immensely. Evers should
emphasize this fact, rather than
look for easy answers.
In his critique of the MAD
posture (of which I am a hesitant
though unashamed advocate) he
makes a valid observation. He
states, and rightly so, that MAD
assures that innocent civilians in
both the U.S. and the Soviet
Union will suffer from the
foolishness of their leaders. They
are undefended hostages of the
opposing government. Since the
Soviet Union would automatically
lose an enormous percentage of its

population if it decided to attack
the United States with nuclear
weapons, it theoretically is
deterred from such insane
behavior.
It may be that this concept is
based, however unwisely, on the
rationality of the leaders of the
nations involved, that in principle
it is morally wrong to hold
innocent people as political pawns
in a global game of nuclear chess.
But Evers fails to mention that it
has worked with regard to
strategic nuclear confrontation
over the last three decades. The
ends never justify the means; but
no alternative doctrine has ever
been proposed which would
endanger innocent civilian
populations less than does MAD.
One additional advantage of
MAD, besides the fact that it
seems to work, is that it provides
the basis for reducing wasteful
defense spending. The strategic
nuclear weapons we have
presently, most of which are
invulnerable to a Soviet
"first-strike," are a credible
deterrent in a world in which
ballistic missile defense is a
technological impossibility. Thus,
a great deal of the rationale for
further spending on offensive
systems, such as MIRVs and the
Trident submarine, is removed.
J do not mean to suggest that
MAD is the ideal posture for the
United States to maintain. In a
fundamental sense, it is "mad," as
are all nuclear postures short of
complete disarmament. But many
people have tried for many years
to achieve the highly desirable
goal of complete disarmament
with a notable lack of success. For
Evers to suggest flippantly that all
we need in order for disarmament
to succeed is for everyone to
support it is to remain blind to a
world in which public sentiment
rarely has anything to do with
national policy.
In England, where perhaps
more than in any other country
public sentiment vocally
supported nuclear disarmament,
the government went right ahead

and adopted nuclear weapons. In
addition, a large percentage of
people in many nations would not
particularly mind seeing their
countries adopt nuclear weapons.
Even in Japan, where one
would expect to find the largest
public sentiment against adoption
of nuclear weapons, one finds
many citizens worried about the
"China threat"; a 1970 poll in
Japan found a sizable portion of
the population unusually
ambivalent about the prospect of
their country adopting nuclear
weapons. The truth of the matter
is that many people want their
countries to go nuclear, and Evers
telling them that they are wrong
probably would not change their
minds.
Arms control, as opposed to
disarmament, is beginning to
work. The SALT I talks severely

limited anti-missile missile defense
systems for a period of 30 days,
no small task considering the
domestic opposition in the U.S. to
such an agreement. Much more
needs to be done in the way of
limiting proliferation of nuclear
weapons, and reducing offensive
capabilities of all nuclear
countries.
Miracles do not occur either
frequently or without some
effort. Disarmament is a miracle
which might well occur, but it will
take many years of intense effort
to bring it about. Oversimplified
and blanket condemnations of
present efforts at arms control
and suggestions of wildly
improbable alternatives contribute
little to the cause of peace.
