# 'Honey' Reaction
## 
### 
Wendy Mortyno

A self-styled critic of Stanford
womanhood, Andy Sidaris,
recently blurted out in the pages
of Sports Illustrated his
impressions of "honey-watching"
in Northern California, indicting
the girls at Stanford for being
"relics from the War of 1812." An
insulted Stanford publicist, Bob
Murphy, defended our wounded
honor by submitting prize "honey
shots" to first the Daily, then the
Chronicle.
"Honey shots," for the
unenlightened, are photographs of
beautiful women attending
sporting events. The Stanford
women's group responded by
calling a press conference to make
clear that they would appreciate
fewer "honey shots"; more
serious coverage of women as
athletes, scholars and achieving
individuals.
The counter-reaction then
began, with letters to the editor
defending the few "dirty old
men" who were just having some
harmless fun, and characterizing
the "honey shots" issue as a trivial
incident — another excuse for
"women's lib" to sound off about
their so-called oppression.
The whole thing may seem
silly. But then, that's the saddest
part. The issue is not simply
Sidaris and his foolishness, or
Murphy's misguided defense of
Stanford women.
Important Issue
The real issue is perhaps a
peripheral one, concerning the
aftermath of this event, rather
than the incident itself. Even
more important than the feminist
stand on the "honey" issue is the
coverage it has received — the
reaction to our reaction.
The lack of understanding of
the specific issue involved — the
total amazement that we are
offended, rather than
complimented, by the "honey
shots" — reflects a more
generalized rpisunderstanding of
the women's movement itself. The
trivialization of this issue — the
news stories replete with sarcastic
comments and snide remarks —
reflects a widespread trivial ization
of the entire movement.
The feminist objection to the
"honey shots" is not difficult to
assimilate. It is simply a reaction
against the widespread
objectification of women in this
society, an objectification typified
by the portrayal of pretty faces
plastered over the news pages, by
the identification of the value of
an institution with the beaty of its
women.
Dominant Stereotypes
The "honey shots" issue is
admittedly a minor one. It gains
its significance only symbolically,
because of ways in which it
reflects the dominant cultural
stereotypes of mind as male, body
as female; the invidious contrast
between the sex-typed goals of
beauty for women, power for
men.
We are still at the point where
the significance of an event like
this must be explained patiently,
slowly, point by point. The
political assumptions of the
women's movement are so widely
misrepresented and so vaguely
understood that our reactions to
an event like this are seen as silly,
overstated and ultimately trivial.
And yet it is precisely these
seemingly trivial incidents which
most glaringly reveal the true
status of women, and the
nonconscious sexist assumptions
which govern our perceptions of
reality. It would seem ridiculous
to plaster handsome jocks all over
the news pages in an effort to
proclaim our pride in Stanford
men. Yet the same thing done to
Stanford women can actually
seem kind of cute.
Measurements And CPA
An early feminist, Mary
Wollstonecraft, warned in 1792
that "the important task of
education will never be begun
until the person of a woman is no
longer preferred to her mind."
Two centuries later, a woman's
measurements remain a more
salient statistic than her grade
point average.
We are not concerned solely
with this sad and silly incident.
"Honey shots" are not the issue —
Sidaris is no more the enemy than
Bobby Riggs. But at the same
time that we fight the larger
battles — in male legislatures and
male courts — we cannot ignore
the thousand daily manifestations
of this society's sexist thinking.
The "trivial" issue of "honey
shots" directly reflects perhaps
the most important battle we are
fighting — simply the struggle to
be taken seriously.
