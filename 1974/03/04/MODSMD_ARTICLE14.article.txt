5 What does one have to do to become a California resident? T.S. \
: Would you believe there's no clear-cut answer for that question? :
slt all depends on why you want to be a California resident, says :
sßob Bouchier, one of the lawyers in the ASSU Legal Counseling j
jOffice. i
: For example, if you want to be a California resident so you can j
igo to Berkeley and pay in-state tuition, you must show your ;
[intention to make California your permanent residence. The |
sregistrar's office at UC Berkeley said that a permanent California :
•address, payment of California income tax, voting in California :
Selections or holding an account in a California bank would be |
: enough to show your intention to make California your permanent ;
: residence.
j There are different requirements if you want to vote in j
[California or hold a driver's license here.
: Bouchier suggested that you call the office or department that :
• you are interested in (for example, the Department of Motor :
| Vehicles for a driver's license and the Registrar of Voters for voting j
• requirements) and ask them what their particular requirements are. j
| With the present concern about oil shortages, we should at least \
\have a way of recycling motor oil. Currently, gas stations and car j
• owners who change their oil just dump the used oil, aggravating our :
Ipollution problem. I remember reading somewhere, perhaps a year j
\ago, that there exist economical ways of "cleaning" used motor oil §
|so it can be reused. Are there any active projects of this nature in j
| the Bay area, and if not, this idea might make a good research \
\project for a SWOPSI chss. C.F.
i There are oil recycling projects in the Bay Area. You can either j
: participate in the ROAR (Recycle Oil And Re-refine) project in i
| Sunnyvale, or take your used motor oil to Fabian Oil Company in \
: Oakland, or Bayside Waste Oil Company in San Carlos.
{ According to Mary Anna Eklund, one of the two people who j
: began the ROAR project, there are 77 drop-off points for waste oil. :
sThey are the City Recycling Center at the corner of Caribbean and :
I Borregas in Sunnyvale, four fire stations and six service stations in :
] the Sunnyvale Area.
[ The fire stations that collect waste oil (anytime after 4 p.m.) are \
I located at Matilda and W. California; Arguez and Wolfe; Lockheed j
i Way and Matilda; and Lawrence Station and Elko.
\ The service stations are Kaifer Road Chevron (811 Kaifer Road), jj
| White Gulf Service (1240 W. El Camino), Safety Auto Service (724 j
j N Matilda), Cappy's Service (1097 E. Duane Ave.), Pete's Exxon E
\ (708 N. Fairoaks Ave.), and the Shell station at the corner of j
i Fremont and Mary.
[ According to Gary Andrews, manager of Campus Shell, all the j
j waste oil they get from oil changes is stored in large underground i
[ tanks. This oil is collected by the Bayside Waste Oil Company and :
: cleaned or "re-refined."
s Bayside Waste Oil, located at 977 Branston Road in San Carlos,:
j will accept used motor oil from individuals, as will Fabian Oil:
• Company at 4200 Alameda Ave. in Oakland.
