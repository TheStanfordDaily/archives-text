ornia's reduced traffic accident
total last month is consistent with
the lower number of vehicles on
the road due to the energy crisis,
California Highway Patrol
Commissioner Walter Pudinski
said last week.
Pudinski said January's traffic
totals, which included the state's
lowest monthly death toll in 12
years, "fell within expected
ranges."
The commissioner added:
"When decreased state highway
system mileage was considered,
accident, death and injury rates
were not significantly lower than
expected when compared to
January experience from 1969
through 1973."
He said mileage driven on
California highways last month is
estimated at eight percent lower
than comparable figures in
previous years.
January's highway death toll of
263 compared with January death
tolls of 267 in 1968, 405 in 1969,
380 in 1970, 359 in 1971, 346 in
1972 and 327 in 1973.
It was the lowest monthly toll
since 243 deaths were recorded in
February 1962.
The highest monthly death toll
ever reported on California
highways was 603 deaths in
December 1967.
