# Auto Czars Consider Minicar
## 
### 
DETROIT (AP) - Big Four
auto makers are eyeing plans to
build American-made minicars —
smaller and lighter than their
present subcompacts — to
compete with successful foreign
imports.
Spokesmen for the auto
companies are tight-lipped about
industry prospects for building
cars smaller than the present Ford
Pinto, Chevrolet Vega and
American Motors Gremlin.
But sources say top auto
executives at General Motors,
Ford, Chrysler and American
Motors are giving such plans a
close look in hopes of introducing
minicars for the 1976 or 1977
model years.
General Motors reportedly is
nearing a decision on whether to
produce a domestic version of its
popular European-made Opel
Kadett.
The four-cylinder engine Opel
is a foot shorter, 3'/2 inches
narrower and several hundred
pounds lighter than the Vega,
which at about 2400 pounds is
GM's smallest American-made car
on the market.
Small car sales accounted for
35 percent of the total U.S. auto
market last year. Predictions are
they could exceed 65 percent by
1976.
