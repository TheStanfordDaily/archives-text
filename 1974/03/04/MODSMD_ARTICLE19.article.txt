# Carpool Matching Has 650 Requests

"We have gotten over 650
responses thus far," said Frank E.
Gallagher, Jr., University
transportation coordinator, "and I
think the response is gratifying."
He was talking about the
carpool service for the Stanford
area* It is a matching service
where people going to and from
the Stanford campus regularly can
form carpools with those with
approximately the same schedules
from the same area.
The Stanford carpool has made
use of the RIDES matching
computer to process the
responses, and the "printouts
should be in sometime in early
March," continued Gallagher.
RIDES Matchups
RIDES is a Bay Area
organization designed to match up
carpoolers in the Bay area.
"Each person who responded
to the Carpool questionnaire will
receive a printout containing up
to 25 names and addresses of
people in their area who have
similar time schedules," said
Gallagher.
"They will also receive a letter
explaining the carpool, with a few
tips on picking people for the
carpool." Some things that might
be taken into consideration would
be timeliness, use of the radio,

and smoking, all of which might
be annoying to other carpoolers,
he said.
When asked who made up the
majority of the responses,
Gallagher answered, "I have the
impression that most of the
applications come from staff
members with regular hours, like
8-5. These will be most easily
matched. Students will be more
difficult to match, but not an
impossibility," he said.
"Most of the responses come
from people within 10-12 miles,"
Gallagher continued,"But we have
received applications from people
as far away as Livermore, Santa
Cruz and Moss Beach."
Carpool Incentive
"Two incentives are offered to
the carpoolers," said Gallagher.
"First, carpoolers of three or
more get preferred parking, and
second, a weekly drawing will be
held for 10 free gallons of gasoline,
donated by Campus Shell."
Some 635 applications have
already been keypunched and sent
up to RIDES for processing.
"We hope that the program can
continue indefinitely, "Gallagher
said. 'This is all part of a
nationwide program to reduce
energy consumption and to
reduce air pollution," he
said.
