# Denies USE Charge
## Barton Optimistic On Talks 
### VLAE KERSHNER DON COX 
Despite the slow pace of
negotiations, Doug Barton, the
University's chief negotiator in talks
with United Stanford Employees
(USE), thinks that the two parties can
reach an agreement in time to head off
a strike by the 1400 workers the union
represents.
USE, which won the right to
bargain for the workers in June,
presented its first set of contract
demands to the University last
November. However, talks have
proceeded slowly, and USE President
Jim Berk has repeatedly said that the
union will strike in the next few
months unless agreements are reached

more quickly.
Barton, speaking at a press
conference at KZSU Friday, refused to
agree with Berk that the University has
been "foot-dragging."
"It isn't in the University's interest
to drag this thing out" he said, because
of the complications caused by the
fact that no matter when the contract
is finally signed, the University must
give retroactive raises from Sept. 1,
1973.
The soft-spoken Barton does not
believe that progress of the
negotiations has been unusually slow.
"It's always tough to reach an
agreement in the first contract," he
said, especially bccause USE "is a large
and diversified union," containing over

80 job classifications.
"What we need is an element of
common trust. If you don't have it,
there's damn little you can put into an
agreement that is going to work," the
former National Labor Relations
Board(NLRB) lawyer said.
Despite the University's
determination "to muddle through"
the contract and avert a strike, Barton
noted "the union's position is very
different from our own," and outlined
three major areas of disagreement:
Agency Shop
—Whether USE should be protected
by an agency shop or by a
"maintenance of standards" clause.
The union's position is that USE
should have, at the least, an agency
shop, which requires all workers in the
bargaining unit to pay union dues.
The University offers only a
"maintenance of standards" clause,
which says only that all persons in the
union when a contract is negotiated
must continue to pay union dues for
the duration of the contract.
While Stanford firemen and
policemen are protected by an agency
shop, Barton said that because not all
employees in the unit represented by
USE want to join the union, "it
doesn't seem fair to use to make those
employees who came here with the
assurance that this was not a financial
obligation," pay union dues.
Standards Clause
—Whether the workers should be
protected by a "maintenance of
standards" clause, which says that no
wages, hours or working conditions
can be lowered during the duration of
a contract.
While agreeing in principle, the
University opposes such a clause
because "we don't want to enter into
an agreement that we contemplate
possibly breaking."
—Whether the contract should state
that no work normally performed by
members of the unit may be
performed by non-members.
Again, according to Barton, the
University agrees in principle that
employees' jobs should be protected.
However, the University wishes to
allow faculty members unsupported
by grants to do their own technical
work in order to save money.

agree with Berk that the University has
been "foot-dragging."
"It isn't in the University's interest
to drag this thing out" he said, because
of the complications caused by the
fact that no matter when the contract
is finally signed, the University must
give retroactive raises from Sept. 1,
1973.
The soft-spoken Barton does not
believe that progress of the
negotiations has been unusually slow.
"It's always tough to reach an
agreement in the first contract," he
said, especially bccause USE "is a large
and diversified union," containing over

80 job classifications.
"What we need is an element of
common trust. If you don't have it,
there's damn little you can put into an
agreement that is going to work," the
former National Labor Relations
Board(NLRB) lawyer said.
Despite the University's
determination "to muddle through"
the contract and avert a strike, Barton
noted "the union's position is very
different from our own," and outlined
three major areas of disagreement:
Agency Shop
—Whether USE should be protected
by an agency shop or by a
"maintenance of standards" clause.
The union's position is that USE
should have, at the least, an agency
shop, which requires all workers in the
bargaining unit to pay union dues.
The University offers only a
"maintenance of standards" clause,
which says only that all persons in the
union when a contract is negotiated
must continue to pay union dues for
the duration of the contract.
While Stanford firemen and
policemen are protected by an agency
shop, Barton said that because not all
employees in the unit represented by
USE want to join the union, "it
doesn't seem fair to use to make those
employees who came here with the
assurance that this was not a financial
obligation," pay union dues.
Standards Clause
—Whether the workers should be
protected by a "maintenance of
standards" clause, which says that no
wages, hours or working conditions
can be lowered during the duration of
a contract.
While agreeing in principle, the
University opposes such a clause
because "we don't want to enter into
an agreement that we contemplate
possibly breaking."
—Whether the contract should state
that no work normally performed by
members of the unit may be
performed by non-members.
Again, according to Barton, the
University agrees in principle that
employees' jobs should be protected.
However, the University wishes to
allow faculty members unsupported
by grants to do their own technical
work in order to save money.

LABOR NEGOTIATOR — Doug Barton discussed the University's side of the
negotiations with representatives of United Stanford Employees at a press
conference last Friday on KZSU. Barton was optimistic about reaching an
agreement in time to head off a strike.
Despite the slow pace of
negotiations, Doug Barton, the
University's chief negotiator in talks
with United Stanford Employees
(USE), thinks that the two parties can
reach an agreement in time to head off
a strike by the 1400 workers the union
represents.
USE, which won the right to
bargain for the workers in June,
presented its first set of contract
demands to the University last
November. However, talks have
proceeded slowly, and USE President
Jim Berk has repeatedly said that the
union will strike in the next few
months unless agreements are reached

more quickly.
Barton, speaking at a press
