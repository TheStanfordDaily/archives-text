# Spikers Nip Fresno For First Victory
## 
### MARK WHITE 
"The meet was much closer
than we expected." So spoke
Stanford track coach Pay ton
Jordan following his team's
narrow 82 1 /2-71 1 /2 victory over
Fresno State Saturday. Stanford
now holds a 26-1 series edge over
the Bulldogs and the Cards will
take their 1-0 1974 dual meet
record against a powerful San Jose
State team this Saturday.
From the start, things boded
poorly for Stanford. Sprinter Ken
Curl had to stay home because of
illness, and valuable hurdler Matt
Hogsett overslept and missed the
bus. The long trip to Fresno was
then lengthened when blustery
weather forced a change of
location for the meet, from
Fresno to the all-weather track at
Lemore High School 40 miles
southwest.
Then leadoff 440 relay sprinter
Manuel Gonzalez aggrevated a
groin injury and the favored Card
quintet lost. Otto Rossner, 10.3
winner in the wind-blown 100
yard dash, severely pulled a
hamstring in the 220. At one
point the Cards trailed 26-6.
"Fresno is a good team, they
are vastly improved over last
year," said Jordan. "Things were
looking bad when we were down
by 20 points. We fought back for
our lives, and I think the times are
quite good considering the
blustery weather.

"Four men did outstanding
jobs Saturday," Jordan continued.
"Scott Wingo, Ken Kring, Dave
Bagshaw and Tony Sandoval all
performed strongly. They led the
way."
Wins 440
Wingo, a freshman, led the
Stanford comeback with an
impressive 49.7 victory in the
440. Down 41-27 going into the
quarter, the Cardinal trio of
Wingo, John Kessel and Scott
Jones swept the race to bring
Stanford to within five of Fresno,
41-36.
Dave Bagshaw then followed
his windy 14.7 victory in the
highs with a 54.6 victory in the
intermediate hurdles. Versatile
Kring finished in second at 55.8,
and went on to nab needed points
with a third place in the long
jump.
Bagshaw and Kring then
teamed up with Kessel and Wingo
to take the mile relay in 3:18.7.
"At the time, Fresno thought
they would have won the meet if
they had taken the mile relay,"
said assistant coach Marshall
Clark.
Tony Sandoval had one of his
strongest performances as a
Cardinal when he showed the
versatility of a Kipcho Kenyo by
winning both the mile and

two-mile runs. Sandoval's 4:14.05
in the mile was followed by Steve
Crowley's 4:18.02 and Dave
Allen's 4:18.04 for a Stanford
sweep. Sandy led another sweep
with his fine 9:01.07 two-mile, as
Mark McConnell (9:06.9) and
Jack Bellah (9;07.0) took second
and third against a fine Fresno
challenger.
Holmes Third
Marvin Holmes closed quickly
for thirds in to the 100 and 220,
and the speedy Wingo ran a clutch
22.1 in the 220 to take second
after Rossner pulled his
hamstring. Ben Scheibel took
second in the 880 at 1:57.05 and
Bruce Wolfe followed close
behind for a third.
In the field events, Steve
Hopkins and Mike Hall provided
the points the outmanned Cards
needed for a team victory.
Hopkins overcame a sore ankle
and wet grounds in winning the
javelin at 212-2. Hall won the
triple jump at 44-4 placed
second in the high jump at 6-0
and took second in the long jump
at 22-0.
In the weight events, Fresno
swept the hammer and won both
the shotput and discus.
