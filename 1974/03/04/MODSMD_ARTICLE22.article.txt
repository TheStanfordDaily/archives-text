# Rainy Weekend Golf Brings Mixed Results
## 
### 
Stanford's golfers had a rough
time on their own in the San
Francisco City tournament over
the weekend, but the Cardinal
team was overpowering Friday in
the Cal State-Hayward
Invitational at Silverado Country
Club in Napa.
The individuals — Dave
Baskins, Conrad Nilmeier and
George Pettinger — were
eliminated from the City event in
this weekend's opening matches.
Baskins thrashed Nilmeier 5 and 4
in Saturday's first round, while
Pettinger lost to Ron Enright, 3
and 2. Sunday , Baskins was a 3
and 2 victim of Kim Flint.
The team, however, coasted to
an easy victory over a suspect
six-team field in Friday's
rain-soaked Hayward tourney. Aly
Trompas sloshed through his 18
holes in even par 72, winning the
individual title by three shots.
Tied for second at 75 were
Baskins, Pettinger and Rich Allen
of Pacific.
Stanford freshman Brent
Murray tied for seventh at 78,
giving the Cards four spots in the
top 10. Conrad Nilmeier rounded

out the Card scoring with an 81
(five scores count toward the
team total).
Stanford's team score was 381,
21 shots ahead of second place
California. Pacific (405), UC-Davis
(409), Cal State-Hayward (416)
and Nevado-Reno (422) rounded
out the field.
The tournament, originally
scheduled for 36 holes, was
shortened to 18 because of the
wet and windy conditions. One
Reno golfer said he "couldn't
hold onto the club after the sixth
hole."
Rain never played a major role
in the City tournament, but all
three Card entrants simply played
average golf. Saturday, Pettinger
was three-over-par in his loss to
Enright, who parred 14 holes,
birdied one and bogied one before
the match ended on the 16th.
Baskins was two-over-par
against his teammate Nilmeier,
who snap-hooked his way to
several disastrous holes.
Yesterday, Baskins was unable to
hold off a one-under par
performance by Flint, and lost 3
and 2.
