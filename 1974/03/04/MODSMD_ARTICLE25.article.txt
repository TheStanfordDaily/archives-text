# Frustrated Ruggers Tie USC
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Frustration is the only word
that can adequately describe
Stanford's 10-10 deadlock with
the USC rugby team on muddy
Harry Maloney Field Saturday.
"We just blew too damn many
scoring opportunities," said
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic,
whose Cards failed to capitalize
on four scoring attempts in the
first half. Stanford's best
opportunity came on an early
penetration to the Trojans' five
yard line, but Troy's scrum
prevailed.
Stanford controlled the
opening scrum, and the first five
minutes of the contest were
played in the Trojans' half of the
field. An offside penalty gave the
Cards a 15-yard penalty kick, but
Lawry Lieberman's boot was
blown to the right by gusts greater
than those which grace
Candlestick Park.
The Cards came back to play
some great defense, including a
50-yard defensive kick by Eric
Test. Test also demonstrated great
offensive skill in setting up the
Card's first score. He eluded five
Trojan defenders and then passed
to Forrie Martin, who scored the
first of his two tries. Lieberman
missed the extra point and the

Cards had to settle for a 4-0 lead
over the Trojans.
The Cards looked like they
were on their way to another
score moments later as Mike
Wood and Lieberman used some
great running to get the ball down
to the Trojans' one yard line. But
Stanford just couldn't push the
ball over the goal line.
The men of Troy scored a try
two minutes later, using great
faking. Ron Guess added the extra
point and the Trojans had a 6-4
halftime lead.
The Cards, cheered on by a
vociferous rooting section led by
injured rugger Craig Zaltosky,
played a great defensive game in
the second half. Stanford blocked
two USC defensive kicks and
frustrated the men of Troy during
most of the half, limiting them to
one score — an unconverted try
which came midway through the
half.
Test set up the Cards second
scoring drive, blocking a USC kick
and then racing downfield. Martin
took a pass from Test and scored
his second try. This time
Lieberman made the wind-aided
extra point to knot the score at
10-10.
Minutes later the Cards had the
game in their grasp when the
Trojans were called for offside.

But Lieberman missed a "gimme"
20-yard kick and time ran out.
USC coach John Petrill had
nothing but praise for the Cards.
"Their defense was great — we
were really lucky to come away
with a tie," Petrill said as the rain
which had played games with the
ruggers all day finally came down
hard. "They should really give Cal
a run for their money next week."
The Cards, now 4-3-1,
conclude the regular season next
Saturday, battling Cal for the 'Big
Scrum Axe' at Harry Lamoney
Field.

his finger elsewhere.
Frustration is the only word
that can adequately describe
Stanford's 10-10 deadlock with
the USC rugby team on muddy
Harry Maloney Field Saturday.
"We just blew too damn many
scoring opportunities," said
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic,
whose Cards failed to capitalize
on four scoring attempts in the
first half. Stanford's best
opportunity came on an early
penetration to the Trojans' five
yard line, but Troy's scrum
prevailed.
Stanford controlled the
opening scrum, and the first five
minutes of the contest were
played in the Trojans' half of the
field. An offside penalty gave the
Cards a 15-yard penalty kick, but
Lawry Lieberman's boot was
blown to the right by gusts greater
than those which grace
Candlestick Park.
The Cards came back to play
some great defense, including a
50-yard defensive kick by Eric
Test. Test also demonstrated great
offensive skill in setting up the
Card's first score. He eluded five
Trojan defenders and then passed
to Forrie Martin, who scored the
first of his two tries. Lieberman
missed the extra point and the

Cards had to settle for a 4-0 lead
over the Trojans.
The Cards looked like they
were on their way to another
score moments later as Mike
Wood and Lieberman used some
great running to get the ball down
to the Trojans' one yard line. But
Stanford just couldn't push the
ball over the goal line.
The men of Troy scored a try
two minutes later, using great
faking. Ron Guess added the extra
point and the Trojans had a 6-4
halftime lead.
The Cards, cheered on by a
vociferous rooting section led by
injured rugger Craig Zaltosky,
played a great defensive game in
the second half. Stanford blocked
two USC defensive kicks and
frustrated the men of Troy during
most of the half, limiting them to
one score — an unconverted try
which came midway through the
half.
Test set up the Cards second
scoring drive, blocking a USC kick
and then racing downfield. Martin
took a pass from Test and scored
his second try. This time
Lieberman made the wind-aided
extra point to knot the score at
10-10.
Minutes later the Cards had the
game in their grasp when the
Trojans were called for offside.

But Lieberman missed a "gimme"
20-yard kick and time ran out.
USC coach John Petrill had
nothing but praise for the Cards.
"Their defense was great — we
were really lucky to come away
with a tie," Petrill said as the rain
which had played games with the
ruggers all day finally came down
hard. "They should really give Cal
a run for their money next week."
The Cards, now 4-3-1,
conclude the regular season next
Saturday, battling Cal for the 'Big
Scrum Axe' at Harry Lamoney
Field.
