# Busy Week Awaits Baseball Team
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team
spent the weekend watching
raindrops fall, but this week —
weather permitting — the Cards
will play six games in five days.
Friday's scheduled game at
Santa Clara was rained out, as
was Saturday's double header
against Fresno State.
This week, the Cards will
face Cal State-Hay ward at
Hayward Tuesday and take on
the Pioneers again on Thursday
at Sunken Diamond.
Wednesday, Stanford travels to
Santa Clara for a game against
the Broncos, and Friday the
Cards meet San Jose State at
San Jose.
Stanford concludes its busy
week Saturday with a Sunken
Diamond doubleheader against
San Jose State.
