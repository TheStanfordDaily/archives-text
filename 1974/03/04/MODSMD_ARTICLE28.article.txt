# Cards Finish Last
## Wrestlers Stumble In Pac-8's 
### STEVE SOULE 
"It was worse than I'd imagined by quite a bit."
The speaker was Stanford wrestling coach Joe De
Meo, and he was referring to the Pacific Eight
wrestling tournament held Friday and Saturday at
Berkeley.
Stanford had entered the tournament with
realistic goals. Admittedly, the injury-ridden Cards
had no chance for the team title, but De Meo
hoped several individuals could qualify for the
NCAA's by placing in the top four. Instead, the
tournament was a total disaster, as the Cards
finished last in the team competition and no
individuals placed in the top four.
Mark Yancey (142) and Roy Tolles (190) placed
fifth individually, while heavyweight Kris
Westersund finished sixth. In the team standings,
Washington won easily, followed by Oregon and
Oregon State.
Things went wrong for Stanford before the
competition even began. First, returning
place-winner Emmett Stanton (158) re-injured his
knee and couldn't wrestle. Then, no Cardinal
wrestlers were seeded in the top four, so Stanford
had to face top-seeded wrestlers at every weight.
It didn't get better when the Cards began
wrestling. Stanford's wrestlers lost their first 15
individual matches in a row, finally winning a
match when California's heavyweight hurt his
shoulder taking down Westersund, and was unable

to continue.
Not to say that no one wrestled well for the
Cards. In the opening round, Yancey, Charlie
Masch (150) and Marc Frelier (167) had good
efforts.
Yancey lost to third-seeded Brent Jacinto of Cal
in an extremely close match. Yancey trailed 4-3,
but escaped with 22 seconds remaining to tie it up.
But Jacinto got a takedown just as the match ended
to win.
Masch apparently had Cal's third-seeded Steve
Whedbeo pinned, when Whedbee took an injury
timeout. After a long break, he seemed
unhampered by whatever injury he claimed to have,
and came back to pin Masch.
Frelier faced the number-two seed at 167, Brady
Hall of UCLA. Frelier wrestled well, but just wasn't
quick enough, losing 7-1.
De Meo explains that, "We did a good job,
considering we were missing several star wrestlers.
We went in with great wrestlers, but they're
inexperienced. These are the best wrestlers in the
United States. You can't compete with freshman,
no matter how good they are ... the only freshmen
here were ours."
About next year, he comments, "It's looking
good for next year, with six guys coming back that
weren't in there (the Pac-B's]. The kids are tough,
they work hard and they like the sport. I'm
encouraged."
