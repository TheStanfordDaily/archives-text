# Cardinal Knowledge
## Eighth Straight For UCLA 
### Stan Wilson 
After the "lost weekend" in Oregon two weeks
ago, UCLA coach John Wooden remained
confident. "We'll come back strong," he predicted.
The Bruins have made a comeback, with
impressive wins over Washington, Washington State
and California. And when they ran their lead to 15
points early in the second half against Stanford
Saturday night, they looked like the Bruins of old,
and many feared the game would become a rout.
It didn't. Tim Patterson and Melvin Arterberry
led the resurgent Cardinals offensively, and center
Rich Kelley shored up the defense. Stanford ac
tually led 55-53, and no one was happier than USC
Bob Boyd, who viewed the game from the press
box. For the first time in six years, the
championship will be decided in the final game.
Look for UCLA to make it eight conference
championships in a row, but this time around it will
be no easy task.
The Bruins emerged from Maples Pavilion
looking strangely and conspicuously mortal—like
tall skinny kids who had acne and sore knees, liked
girls and apple pie and could miss shots. They could
even lose. And Saturday night they were damn
lucky to win.
No Patience
"We simply have not played with patience,"
Wooden lamented after the game. "We were
shooting too quickly, and they kept the ball away
from Walton. Stanford shot well in the stretch."
Patterson's 'stretch' lasted 40 minutes, as he
scored a career high 26 points and grabbed eight
rebounds. The 6-11 soph turned in a Jeckyl and
Hyde performance over the weekend. He played
only 19 minutes on Friday night against USC,
grabbing only one rebound and failing to score a
point.
"Patterson looks like an Ail-American against
us," Wooden said. "If he played against us all the
time he'd be leading the conference in scoring."
And Arterberry might be second. The 6-3 junior
scored 15 points (7-10 from the floor) and grabbed
eight rebounds —a total of 34 points and 12
rebounds against two of the best teams in the
country, not bad for a guard who has trouble
drawing iron outside of 15 feet. "I always felt that
Arterberry was a very fine player," said Wooden.

But opinion is split over the championship game
this Saturday. UCLA has had trouble in nearly all
of its conference road games, but playing in the
Sports Arena in Los Angeles is hardly like playing
in Oregon's Mac Arthur Court.
"I think USC is the type of team that can give
them a good game," said Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar. "They have a lot of patience, which is
what you need against UCLA. If you can control

the ball 60 or 70 percent of the time, you don't
have to worry as much about defensing the big
guy"
Boyd felt this was the key to the Oregon and
Oregon State wins over the Bruins two weeks ago.
"They always had someone fronting Walton," he
said, and Oregon in particular usually had two or
three other players within pushing and shoving
range whenever the ball went inside to the big
redhead.
With this kind of sagging defense, UCLA has got
to get some outside shooting, but it has been
lacking. "I know [Tommy] Curtis and [Dave]
Meyers are good shooters," said Wooden, "but
they've lost confidence."
"Southern Cal has better guards," said
Arterberry, referring to veterans Dan Anderson and
Gus Williams. "They're quicker and play better
defense."
"I think it'll be a close game," said Patterson."
UCLA has a better offense, but USC is better
defensively." Junior forward Archie Dean had no
doubts. "SC's gonna beat them," he predicted.
Why the return to mortality for the Bruins
this year? Some people have conjectured that
maybe UCLA got as tired of winning as everyone
else got with seeing them win. Bill Walton hadn't
played in a losing basketball game since his junior
year in high school.
Too Conservative?
This theory is possible, but not likely. Others
had claimed that the Bruins have become 'too
conservative' since losing assistant coach Denny
Crum (Crum is now the head man at Louisville.).
People just can't understand how a team with two
returning All Americans (Walton and Keith Wilkes)
one returning starting guard (Tommy Curtin) and
another part time starter (Greg Lee), could do
anything but continue to intimidate opponents.
The Pac-8 is definitely stronger this year. It is
obvious, judging from the upsets of USC by
Washington State and the Oregon schools' wins
over UCLA, that anybody can beat anybody on any
given night, borrowing an over-worked but useful
cliche. But most importantly, UCLA is weaker this
year. Forward Larry Farmer was probably the most
underrated player in the conference last year, and
guard Larry Hollyfield, his obnoxious antics on the
court aside, was a very effective player and a fine
outside shot. These two have been more difficult to
replace than most people had anticipated.
But look for Walton and Co. to return to
dominance, starting this weekend against USC. The
road will probably be a little rougher, but NCAA
championship number 10—UCLA's eighth straight-is
just over the horizon for Wooden and the Bruins.
