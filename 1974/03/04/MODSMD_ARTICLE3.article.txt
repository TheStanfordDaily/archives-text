# Appeals Court Won't Remove Gag Order
## 
### DON COX 
The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals refused Friday to lift a gag
order on Law Prof. William Gould
prohibiting all communication about
the $50 million class action suit he has
brought against trucking firms and the
Teamsters, Gould told the Daily
yesterday.
Gould surmised that while "the
appeals court may have thought [U.S.
District Court Judge Robert]
Schnacke's gag order was
unconstitutional, in the interests of
orderly judicial administration, they
will let the lower court have full crack
at it before they intervene."
The gag order was imposed by
Schnacke following complaints from
the defendants' attorneys that Gould
was engaged in the unethical
solicitation of clients.
Gould has maintained that he was
only trying to collect evidence for the
trial of the trucking firms and unions.
They are charged in Gould's suit,
brought on the behalf of eight
minority truck drivers, as having
engaged in discriminatory hiring

practices.
Gould broke a two week silence
and lashed out at the attorneys for the
Pacific Intermountain Express (P.1.E.)
company and Teamster Union locals.
Tactics
He said "the defendants' tactics are
really the same kind of tactics used in
the Deep South against the civil rights
people in the 605."
Gould based his right to comment
now about the case on a Feb. 25 order
by Schnacke that refined the
communication ban to members of a
specific class.
"Presumably this [refers to]
applicants and employees of the
trucking companies," said Gould.
Gould said that the Feb. 25 order
was questionable in light of judicial
procedures that require specific time
periods during which objections to
motions may be filed, to precede
rulings on the motions.
He said that he had not been
informed of the motion to refine the
communication ban and the
subsequent court order doing so.
