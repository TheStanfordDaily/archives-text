# JV Cagers Reach Pinnacle Of Season
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Call it the crowd factor. Or
attribute it to an incredible
rebound advantage of 67-27. For
whatever reason, Stanford's junior
varsity cagers reached the pinnacle
of their season Saturday night
with a 103-71 win over the
Sacramento State JV before abour
1000 fans who showed up at
Maples early for the varsity's game
with UCLA.
Billy Jones' JV, now 10-6
needed the uplift of a
commanding win. The evening
before, the squad had come up
flat for a rematch with the Pacific
JV and had been handed a 62-61
loss that snapped the Cards'
six-game winning streak.
The difference in the quality of
the two opponents was negligible.
The disparity in Stanford's two
performances was staggering. On
Saturday, center Scott Russell's
new "Abdul-Jabbar" hook shot
was going in when it hadn't
before, the Cards' full-court press
was forcing turnovers where it had
only picked up fouls Friday and
team scoring leader Marty
Moroski, who admitted he "felt a
lot better," was shooting at his
old pace again.
The mechanics of Stanford's
win Saturday were simple. The
Cards blew the Hornets out early
(Stanford led 35-16 with 8:02 to
go in the first half), led by 28 at
halftime, allowed Sacramento to
pull within 16 at 9:37 to go in the
game, and then, with the regulars
still in, widened the gap back to
90-61 with 4:50 left.
Jones then flooded the lineup
with subs, and Loren Staley's six
straight points (his first of the
season) brought the Cards past the
century mark in regulation for the
first time this season.
Outstanding player for
Stanford was Warner Session,
whose finest game of the season
netted 21 points most of them on
driving layups. Session credited
his showing to "a lot of
opportunities for the fast break. I
had a lot of easy drives—that's my
kind of game."
"His kind of game," chimed in
Sven Walker, whose swan song
before his "Men" included 15
points and nine rebounds.
"Everybody played well,"
remarked assistant coach Bob
Buell afterward. "In the first half
we did everything right.
"Scott Russell played an
Intimidating game inside," Buell
continued. "He was scoring like a
machine." (Russell had 19 points
and 12 rebounds).
Buell saved highest praise for
the team's leading point man.
"Session was super-super defense,
super drives."
The locker room scene was a
far cry from the evening before,

when it had been the site of angry
comments after the Cards
dropped a one-point decision in
overtime to Pacific.
"We got screwed," excoriated
Session, referring in particular to
Pacific's winning hoop at the
buzzer by Duke Aiona, who took
"eight steps with the ball" in his
drive for the basket, according to
Buell.
Indeed, Stanford was the
victim of questionable calls all
game, prompting a terse Buell
critique of the officials: "Double
no comment."
Stanford's big three—Walker,
Russell and Moroski had fouled
out the 10:50, 6:27 and 2:04,
respectively, to go in the second
half, devastating the Cardinal
attack.
What caused Stanford to equal
its season high of fouls? "The
officials had to help," said Buell.
"There were a number of
questionable calls."
Decimated by foul-outs,
Stanford still could, and perhaps
should, have won the game. The
reason: Terry McCartin. The Card
sharpshooter scored at a slow pace
while Stanford held a slight lead
throughout most of the game, but
when Pacific moved ahead, 46-45,
with 7:30 left in the second half,
he came alive.
McCartin scored 12 of his 18
points from that time on,
including a 28-footer with 15
seconds left which tied the score
in regulation, 57-57, and a basket
which most thought would win
the game: a score with three
seconds left in overtime after a
great pass from Session.
But Stanford's 61-60 lead
would not last those final three
seconds, and the time was far past
to correct the sluggishness which
along with Dave Nunes' shooting
for Pacific had prevented the
Cards from running away with the
game in the first half.

should, have won the game. The
reason: Terry McCartin. The Card
sharpshooter scored at a slow pace
while Stanford held a slight lead
throughout most of the game, but
when Pacific moved ahead, 46-45,
with 7:30 left in the second half,
he came alive.
McCartin scored 12 of his 18
points from that time on,
including a 28-footer with 15
seconds left which tied the score
in regulation, 57-57, and a basket
which most thought would win
the game: a score with three
seconds left in overtime after a
great pass from Session.
But Stanford's 61-60 lead
would not last those final three
seconds, and the time was far past
to correct the sluggishness which
along with Dave Nunes' shooting
for Pacific had prevented the
Cards from running away with the
game in the first half.
Call it the crowd factor. Or
attribute it to an incredible
rebound advantage of 67-27. For
whatever reason, Stanford's junior
varsity cagers reached the pinnacle
of their season Saturday night
with a 103-71 win over the
Sacramento State JV before abour
1000 fans who showed up at
Maples early for the varsity's game
with UCLA.
Billy Jones' JV, now 10-6
needed the uplift of a
commanding win. The evening
before, the squad had come up
flat for a rematch with the Pacific
JV and had been handed a 62-61
loss that snapped the Cards'
six-game winning streak.
The difference in the quality of
the two opponents was negligible.
The disparity in Stanford's two
performances was staggering. On
Saturday, center Scott Russell's
new "Abdul-Jabbar" hook shot
was going in when it hadn't
before, the Cards' full-court press
was forcing turnovers where it had
only picked up fouls Friday and
team scoring leader Marty
Moroski, who admitted he "felt a
lot better," was shooting at his
old pace again.
The mechanics of Stanford's
win Saturday were simple. The
Cards blew the Hornets out early
(Stanford led 35-16 with 8:02 to
go in the first half), led by 28 at
halftime, allowed Sacramento to
pull within 16 at 9:37 to go in the
game, and then, with the regulars
still in, widened the gap back to
90-61 with 4:50 left.
Jones then flooded the lineup
with subs, and Loren Staley's six
straight points (his first of the
season) brought the Cards past the
century mark in regulation for the
first time this season.
Outstanding player for
Stanford was Warner Session,
whose finest game of the season
netted 21 points most of them on
driving layups. Session credited
his showing to "a lot of
opportunities for the fast break. I
had a lot of easy drives—that's my
kind of game."
"His kind of game," chimed in
Sven Walker, whose swan song
before his "Men" included 15
points and nine rebounds.
"Everybody played well,"
remarked assistant coach Bob
Buell afterward. "In the first half
we did everything right.
"Scott Russell played an
Intimidating game inside," Buell
continued. "He was scoring like a
machine." (Russell had 19 points
and 12 rebounds).
Buell saved highest praise for
the team's leading point man.
"Session was super-super defense,
super drives."
The locker room scene was a
far cry from the evening before,

when it had been the site of angry
comments after the Cards
dropped a one-point decision in
overtime to Pacific.
"We got screwed," excoriated
Session, referring in particular to
Pacific's winning hoop at the
buzzer by Duke Aiona, who took
"eight steps with the ball" in his
drive for the basket, according to
Buell.
Indeed, Stanford was the
victim of questionable calls all
game, prompting a terse Buell
critique of the officials: "Double
no comment."
Stanford's big three—Walker,
Russell and Moroski had fouled
out the 10:50, 6:27 and 2:04,
respectively, to go in the second
half, devastating the Cardinal
attack.
What caused Stanford to equal
its season high of fouls? "The
officials had to help," said Buell.
"There were a number of
questionable calls."

dropped a one-point decision in
overtime to Pacific.
"We got screwed," excoriated
Session, referring in particular to
Pacific's winning hoop at the
buzzer by Duke Aiona, who took
"eight steps with the ball" in his
drive for the basket, according to
Buell.
Indeed, Stanford was the
victim of questionable calls all
game, prompting a terse Buell
critique of the officials: "Double
no comment."
Stanford's big three—Walker,
Russell and Moroski had fouled
out the 10:50, 6:27 and 2:04,
respectively, to go in the second
half, devastating the Cardinal
attack.
What caused Stanford to equal
its season high of fouls? "The
officials had to help," said Buell.
"There were a number of
questionable calls."
Decimated by foul-outs,
Stanford still could, and perhaps
should, have won the game. The
reason: Terry McCartin. The Card
sharpshooter scored at a slow pace
while Stanford held a slight lead
throughout most of the game, but
when Pacific moved ahead, 46-45,
with 7:30 left in the second half,
he came alive.
McCartin scored 12 of his 18
points from that time on,
including a 28-footer with 15
seconds left which tied the score
in regulation, 57-57, and a basket
which most thought would win
the game: a score with three
seconds left in overtime after a
great pass from Session.
But Stanford's 61-60 lead
would not last those final three
seconds, and the time was far past
to correct the sluggishness which
along with Dave Nunes' shooting
for Pacific had prevented the
Cards from running away with the
game in the first half.
