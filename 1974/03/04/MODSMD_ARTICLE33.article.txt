# Trojans Survive Late Stanford Rally
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Tenth-ranked USC 62,
Stanford 59. A great, exciting
basketball game, right?
Not quite. Actually, neither
the Trojans nor the Cardinals
could find the hoop during Friday
night's battle at Maples Pavilion.
However, the 6239 fans forgot the
Cards' miscues during a thrilling
stretch drive that saw Stanford
rally from a 10-point deficit to
almost knock the Trojans out of
their first-place tie with UCLA.
With eight minutes to play,
Stanford trailed 50-40, and USC
coach Bob Boyd felt "pretty
confident."
Then Melvin Arterberry and Ed
Schweitzer took over. A 13-footer
by Arterberry, a beautiful
backdoor pass from Arterberry to
Schweitzer, a return layup by
Eddie.... Suddenly there are three
minutes to play and Stanford
trails by only three points, an
incredibly small margin
considering the fact that Rich
Kelley is barely shooting 25
percent.
Touchdown
A minute and a half later,
Stanford still trails by three,
56-53. Timeout Stanford. USC's
Mike Westra takes the ball on the
inbounds pass and fires a
length-of-the-court pass to Gus
Williams, who scores an easy
layup that makes Stanford look
foolish.
But the Cards don't give up.
Scott Trobbe, playing over half
the game as a substitute for Tim
Patterson, who couldn't score a
point, drives madly down the left
baseline for a lay-up.
Timeout Stanford. When play
resumes, Trobbe throws himself in
front of Trojan forward John
Lambert, who seconds earlier
missed a one-and-one. Lambert
does it again, and Mark Gilberg
quickly gets his fifth assist of the
night, hitting Arterberry under
the basket for an easy layup.
Timeout Stanford. The
Cardinal fans are so excited, with
their team trailing only 58-57,
that they completely forget
themselves and start rhythmically
clapping to USC's infamous fight
song. A few seconds later they
remember themselves and shower
a chorus of boos on the Trojan
band.
Westra Converts
When play resumes, Gilberg
quickly fouls Bob Trowbridge.
Trowbridge blows the
one-and-one, but Mike Westra gets
the rebound and is fouled by
Arterberry. Westra, only a 48
percent free shooter, breaks
the Trojans' jinx at the line by
hitting both halves of the
one-and-one.
Still, Stanford comes back.
Kelley takes a shot that rolls
around on the rim for a few
seconds and finally drops in. But
the official rules that Schweitzer
helped it in. Even though Ed
swears "I never touched it,"
offensive interference is called and
for all practical purposes, it's all
over.

After the game, USC coach
Bob Boyd had nothing but praise
for the way Howie Dallmar
coached the final few minutes.
"Stanford used the tools of the
game very well. They used their
timeouts well [calling four in the
final minute and a half] and
fouled the people who couldn't
shoot free throws."
But Boyd, correctly, refused to
say that Stanford played a great
game just because the Cards came
within three points of an upset.
"I'd like to give them a lot of
credit, but in truth, we took a lot
of good shots that just didn't go
in."
Trojans Cold
That was especially true in the
first half, when USC, which
normally shoots 52 percent from
the field, connected on only 38
percent of its shots.
Still, the Cards would not have
had a 29-27 halftime lead had it
not been for the amazing play of
Arterberry. The junior guard, best
known for his defensive play, hit
six of seven shots in the half.
So, at halftime, according to
Trojan guard Gus Williams, Boyd
was pretty mad. "Arterberry's the
best player on the floor right now.
What do you think you're doing?
He's only averaging five or six
points a game," the coach yelled
at Williams.
And Gus, aided by the fact
that Arterberry had to play the
entire game, came back in the
second half and played somewhat
better defense.
The other interesting individual
battle took place between Kelley
and Westra. Boyd said after the
game that "Westra is playing the
best of his career. Mike minimized
Kelley...you can't stop him."
Actually though, Kelley may
have minimized himself more than
Westra did. Stanford's junior
center frequently got the ball
inside, but hit only six of 23
shots, far below his average.
Kelley did dominate the boards,
however, grabbing 18 rebounds.
