## Trojans Squeak Past Bears 
### 
A funny thing almost
happened to the USC Trojans
Saturday on their way to next
week's climactic showdown with
UCLA.
A fired-up Cal squad battled
back from a 52-37 deficit to take
a 67-66 lead with 12 seconds left,
only to lose 70-67 when Dan
Anderson scored four points in
the last four seconds.
Leading for only the second
time in the entire contest, Cal saw
Anderson fire a 15-foot bank shot
with four seconds left to put the
Trojans back into the lead—and
possibly to put himself on the
All-Pac-8 squad.
Then the Bears called a
time-out they weren't entitled to
and Anderson converted the
technical, and scored again when
he was fouled after the in bounds
pass.

The night before, Cal had fared
substantially worse at the hands
of UCLA. Leading 34-29 at
halftime, the Bruins breezed
through the second half to score
an easy 83-60 triumph. Cal's
Brady Allen topped all scorers
with 24 points in a losing cause;
Bill Walton and Keith Wilkes
scored 17 and 19, respectively, to
pace the victors.
Although both Cal and
Stanford came close to upsets
against their southland rivals, the
only genuine upset came up in
Seattle, where Washington's Ron
Williams hit two free throws with
six seconds left in overtime to
preserve an 84-80 Husky victory
over favored Oregon.
Oregon State called on center
Doug Oxsen for a career-high 16
points—all in the first half— to
help defeat Washington State
76-63 Saturday.
