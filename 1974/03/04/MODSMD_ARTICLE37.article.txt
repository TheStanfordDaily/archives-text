Six losses by three points or
less. Two more by seven. A losing
season.
"We don't win any close
games," a weary, disappointed
Howie Dallmar sighed in the
Cardinal locker room Saturday
night. "I feel sorry for the kids —
we're just snakebitten."
Across the way, John Wooden
told reporters that Stanford is a
"very, very capable team. They've
lost some tough, close ball
games."
This one was very tough. The
Cardinals, trailing by 15 points
with 17 minutes left, rallied to a
55-53 lead 14 minutes later. But
the lead was short-lived, and when
Mark Gilberg's desperation
50-footer at the buzzer grazed the
bottom of the rim, the
third-ranked Bruins had a 62-60
victory over the stubborn
Cardinals, whose record fell to 5-8
in the league and 11-13 overall.
"Stanford refused to make
things easy for us," Wooden said.
"They shot well in the stretch."
The stretch began somewhere
around the 12-minute mark, when
Tim Patterson and Rich Kelley
decided that the Bruins could be
beaten. Three times the Cards
pulled within six points — first
when Patterson took a pass from
Kelley and flipped in a six-foot
bank shot, then on a 25-foot
Patterson bomb, then on an
electrifying reverse lay up by
Kelley.
Harried, the Bruins threw a

pass to the Stanford bench — and
a few seconds later Ed Schweitzer
scored over Keith Wilkes,
narrowing the gap to four.
UCLA next hurled a pass into
the Red Vest Band, and the Cards
had yet another opportunity.
Melvin Arterberry converted that
one, battling in the lane and
eventually tipping in an errant
Cardinal shot.
The Bruins retaliated on a
13-footer by Andre McCarter, but
Kelley once again pulled the Cards
within two with a 12-foot bank
shot, prompting one fan to
scream, "We're playing with five
guards."
Two minutes later, after
Arterberry had rebounded an
awesome Kelley rejection of a
Dave Meyers layup, Patterson
connected on an eight-foot
fallaway, tying the score at 51.
The fans were excited, Dallmar
was anxious and Wooden was
scared.
Fifth Foul
Fifteen seconds later, though,
the Crowd was hushed as referee
Booker Turner pointed an
accusing finger at Kelley, who was
sprawled on the ground after
trying to steal the ball from
McCarter. Kelley was charged
with his fifth foul, and the fans
who gave him a thunderous
standing ovation lost much of
their hope. A Bruin victory
seemed assured.
Arterberry and Patterson,
however, were not entertaining
any thoughts of defeat. After
another clutch jumper by
McCarter, Melvin stared in an
eight-footer to tie the score at 53.
Forty seconds later, Patterson fed
him perfectly underneath, and the
automatic layup put the Cards on
top for the first time since the
game's early minutes.
A three-point play by Walton
and two free throws by Wilkes put
the Bruins ahead by three, but
Scott Trobbe narrowed the gap
with a five-footer over Greg Lee.
UCLA led 58-57 with 2:06
remaining.
The Bruins went into a delay
game, which worked until
Patterson drew an offensive foul
with an Academy Award
performance. Fifteen seconds
later, though, the Cards gave the
ball back.
Last Chance
This time, UCLA held it until
the 41-second mark, when Mark
Gil berg fouled McCarter.
McCarter's first attempt on the
one-and-one was long, and
Arterberry grabbed the rebound.
Dallmar told his players to
"shoot if you have a good shot."
Scott Trobbe did, but his
16-footer fell short, as did the
brilliant Cardinal effort.
"You have to give our kids
credit," Dallmar said. "They were
15 down and battled back."
"Patterson played a fine game,
and for a guy who doesn't score a
point, Mark Gilberg does a super
job defensively and handling the

press."
Gilberg, whose only shot was
the last-second 50-footer, played a
superb floor game. And
Arterberry, who added 15 points
to his 19-point Friday effort, was
the best guard on the court both
nights.
Patterson connected on 10-15
shots from the field and 6-7 from
the line in a 26-point
performance, but more
importantly, he played with
overflowing confidence. "We've
played 'em close before," he said.
"There were times when I really
thought we'd win it."
And he wasn't hesitant or
intimidated. "If I get the shots,
I'm gonna shoot 'em. There's no
problem if I get my regular
shots."
Walton Overpowering
Still, Patterson was only the
second best big man on the floor.
Bill Walton was dominant in the
first half, scoring 16 points and
grabbing eight rebounds. He
finished with 23 points (11-12
from the floor) and 11 caroms.
"He's so quick," said an
awe-struck Dallmar. "Once he
blocked a shot on the left side of
the board and got the rebound on
the right side."
And Wilkes, Dallmar said,
"came through with some key
baskets down the stretch — like he
always does."
Wooden said, "I thought our
play was spotty, and Stanford had
a lot to do with that. Walton's
baskets were primarily off the
board — Stanford did a pretty
good job of keeping the ball away
from him."
For UCLA, Saturday's
confrontation with USC for the
Pac-8 championship lies ahead.
Stanford, win or lose against Cal
Friday, will have to replay the
countless disheartening moments
of a losing season throughout the
summer. All five Cardinal starters
return; maybe, a year's experience
and maturity will turn some of
those see-saw losses the other way
in 1974-75.
"I sure hope so," Dallmar said.

Patterson connected on 10-15
shots from the field and 6-7 from
the line in a 26-point
performance, but more
importantly, he played with
overflowing confidence. "We've
played 'em close before," he said.
"There were times when I really
thought we'd win it."
And he wasn't hesitant or
intimidated. "If I get the shots,
I'm gonna shoot 'em. There's no
problem if I get my regular
shots."
Walton Overpowering
Still, Patterson was only the
second best big man on the floor.
Bill Walton was dominant in the
first half, scoring 16 points and
grabbing eight rebounds. He
finished with 23 points (11-12
from the floor) and 11 caroms.
"He's so quick," said an
awe-struck Dallmar. "Once he
blocked a shot on the left side of
the board and got the rebound on
the right side."
And Wilkes, Dallmar said,
"came through with some key
baskets down the stretch — like he
always does."
Wooden said, "I thought our
play was spotty, and Stanford had
a lot to do with that. Walton's
baskets were primarily off the
board — Stanford did a pretty
good job of keeping the ball away
from him."
For UCLA, Saturday's
confrontation with USC for the
Pac-8 championship lies ahead.
Stanford, win or lose against Cal
Friday, will have to replay the
countless disheartening moments
of a losing season throughout the
summer. All five Cardinal starters
return; maybe, a year's experience
and maturity will turn some of
those see-saw losses the other way
in 1974-75.
"I sure hope so," Dallmar said.
Nevada-Reno 76, Stanford 69.
Kentucky 78, Stanford 77.
Oregon 48, Stanford 47.
Oregon State 56, Stanford 53.
USC 64, Stanford 57.
Oregon 72, Stanford 71.
USC 62, Stanford 59.
UCLA 62, Stanford 60.
Six losses by three points or
less. Two more by seven. A losing
season.
"We don't win any close
games," a weary, disappointed
Howie Dallmar sighed in the
Cardinal locker room Saturday
night. "I feel sorry for the kids —
we're just snakebitten."
Across the way, John Wooden
told reporters that Stanford is a
"very, very capable team. They've
lost some tough, close ball
games."
This one was very tough. The
Cardinals, trailing by 15 points
with 17 minutes left, rallied to a
55-53 lead 14 minutes later. But
the lead was short-lived, and when
Mark Gilberg's desperation
50-footer at the buzzer grazed the
bottom of the rim, the
third-ranked Bruins had a 62-60
victory over the stubborn
Cardinals, whose record fell to 5-8
in the league and 11-13 overall.
"Stanford refused to make
things easy for us," Wooden said.
"They shot well in the stretch."
The stretch began somewhere
around the 12-minute mark, when
Tim Patterson and Rich Kelley
decided that the Bruins could be
beaten. Three times the Cards
pulled within six points — first
when Patterson took a pass from
Kelley and flipped in a six-foot
bank shot, then on a 25-foot
Patterson bomb, then on an
electrifying reverse lay up by
Kelley.
Harried, the Bruins threw a

pass to the Stanford bench — and
a few seconds later Ed Schweitzer
scored over Keith Wilkes,
narrowing the gap to four.
UCLA next hurled a pass into
the Red Vest Band, and the Cards
had yet another opportunity.
Melvin Arterberry converted that
one, battling in the lane and
eventually tipping in an errant
Cardinal shot.
The Bruins retaliated on a
13-footer by Andre McCarter, but
Kelley once again pulled the Cards
within two with a 12-foot bank
shot, prompting one fan to
scream, "We're playing with five
guards."
Two minutes later, after
Arterberry had rebounded an
awesome Kelley rejection of a
Dave Meyers layup, Patterson
connected on an eight-foot
fallaway, tying the score at 51.
The fans were excited, Dallmar
was anxious and Wooden was
scared.
Fifth Foul
Fifteen seconds later, though,
the Crowd was hushed as referee
Booker Turner pointed an
accusing finger at Kelley, who was
sprawled on the ground after
trying to steal the ball from
McCarter. Kelley was charged
with his fifth foul, and the fans
who gave him a thunderous
standing ovation lost much of
their hope. A Bruin victory
seemed assured.
Arterberry and Patterson,
however, were not entertaining
any thoughts of defeat. After
another clutch jumper by
McCarter, Melvin stared in an
eight-footer to tie the score at 53.
Forty seconds later, Patterson fed
him perfectly underneath, and the
automatic layup put the Cards on
top for the first time since the
game's early minutes.
A three-point play by Walton
and two free throws by Wilkes put
the Bruins ahead by three, but
Scott Trobbe narrowed the gap
with a five-footer over Greg Lee.
UCLA led 58-57 with 2:06
remaining.
The Bruins went into a delay
game, which worked until
Patterson drew an offensive foul
with an Academy Award
performance. Fifteen seconds
later, though, the Cards gave the
ball back.
Last Chance
This time, UCLA held it until
the 41-second mark, when Mark
Gil berg fouled McCarter.
McCarter's first attempt on the
one-and-one was long, and
Arterberry grabbed the rebound.
Dallmar told his players to
"shoot if you have a good shot."
Scott Trobbe did, but his
16-footer fell short, as did the
brilliant Cardinal effort.
"You have to give our kids
credit," Dallmar said. "They were
15 down and battled back."
"Patterson played a fine game,
and for a guy who doesn't score a
point, Mark Gilberg does a super
job defensively and handling the

press."
Gilberg, whose only shot was
the last-second 50-footer, played a
superb floor game. And
Arterberry, who added 15 points
to his 19-point Friday effort, was
the best guard on the court both
nights.
Patterson connected on 10-15
shots from the field and 6-7 from
the line in a 26-point
performance, but more

overflowing confidence. "We've

any thoughts of defeat. After
another clutch jumper by
McCarter, Melvin stared in an
eight-footer to tie the score at 53.
Forty seconds later, Patterson fed
him perfectly underneath, and the
automatic layup put the Cards on
top for the first time since the
game's early minutes.
A three-point play by Walton
and two free throws by Wilkes put
the Bruins ahead by three, but
Scott Trobbe narrowed the gap
with a five-footer over Greg Lee.
UCLA led 58-57 with 2:06
remaining.
The Bruins went into a delay
game, which worked until
Patterson drew an offensive foul
with an Academy Award
performance. Fifteen seconds
later, though, the Cards gave the
ball back.
Last Chance
This time, UCLA held it until
the 41-second mark, when Mark
Gil berg fouled McCarter.
McCarter's first attempt on the
one-and-one was long, and
Arterberry grabbed the rebound.
Dallmar told his players to
"shoot if you have a good shot."
Scott Trobbe did, but his
16-footer fell short, as did the
brilliant Cardinal effort.
"You have to give our kids
credit," Dallmar said. "They were
15 down and battled back."
"Patterson played a fine game,
and for a guy who doesn't score a
point, Mark Gilberg does a super
job defensively and handling the

press."
Gilberg, whose only shot was
the last-second 50-footer, played a
superb floor game. And
Arterberry, who added 15 points
to his 19-point Friday effort, was
the best guard on the court both
nights.
Patterson connected on 10-15
shots from the field and 6-7 from
the line in a 26-point
performance, but more
importantly, he played with
overflowing confidence. "We've
played 'em close before," he said.
"There were times when I really
thought we'd win it."
And he wasn't hesitant or
intimidated. "If I get the shots,
I'm gonna shoot 'em. There's no
problem if I get my regular
shots."
Walton Overpowering
Still, Patterson was only the
second best big man on the floor.
Bill Walton was dominant in the
first half, scoring 16 points and
grabbing eight rebounds. He
finished with 23 points (11-12
from the floor) and 11 caroms.
"He's so quick," said an
awe-struck Dallmar. "Once he
blocked a shot on the left side of
the board and got the rebound on
the right side."
And Wilkes, Dallmar said,
"came through with some key
baskets down the stretch — like he
always does."
Wooden said, "I thought our
play was spotty, and Stanford had
a lot to do with that. Walton's
baskets were primarily off the
board — Stanford did a pretty
good job of keeping the ball away
from him."
For UCLA, Saturday's
confrontation with USC for the
Pac-8 championship lies ahead.
Stanford, win or lose against Cal
Friday, will have to replay the
countless disheartening moments
of a losing season throughout the
summer. All five Cardinal starters
return; maybe, a year's experience
and maturity will turn some of
those see-saw losses the other way
in 1974-75.
"I sure hope so," Dallmar said.
Nevada-Reno 76, Stanford 69.
Kentucky 78, Stanford 77.
Oregon 48, Stanford 47.
Oregon State 56, Stanford 53.
USC 64, Stanford 57.
Oregon 72, Stanford 71.
USC 62, Stanford 59.
UCLA 62, Stanford 60.
Six losses by three points or
less. Two more by seven. A losing
season.
"We don't win any close
games," a weary, disappointed
Howie Dallmar sighed in the
Cardinal locker room Saturday
night. "I feel sorry for the kids —
we're just snakebitten."
Across the way, John Wooden
told reporters that Stanford is a
"very, very capable team. They've
lost some tough, close ball
games."
This one was very tough. The
Cardinals, trailing by 15 points
with 17 minutes left, rallied to a
55-53 lead 14 minutes later. But
the lead was short-lived, and when
Mark Gilberg's desperation
50-footer at the buzzer grazed the
bottom of the rim, the
third-ranked Bruins had a 62-60
victory over the stubborn
Cardinals, whose record fell to 5-8
in the league and 11-13 overall.
"Stanford refused to make
things easy for us," Wooden said.
"They shot well in the stretch."
The stretch began somewhere
around the 12-minute mark, when
Tim Patterson and Rich Kelley
decided that the Bruins could be
beaten. Three times the Cards
pulled within six points — first
when Patterson took a pass from
Kelley and flipped in a six-foot
bank shot, then on a 25-foot
Patterson bomb, then on an
electrifying reverse lay up by
Kelley.
Harried, the Bruins threw a

pass to the Stanford bench — and
a few seconds later Ed Schweitzer
scored over Keith Wilkes,
narrowing the gap to four.
UCLA next hurled a pass into
the Red Vest Band, and the Cards
had yet another opportunity.
Melvin Arterberry converted that
one, battling in the lane and
eventually tipping in an errant
Cardinal shot.
The Bruins retaliated on a
13-footer by Andre McCarter, but
Kelley once again pulled the Cards
within two with a 12-foot bank
shot, prompting one fan to
scream, "We're playing with five
guards."
Two minutes later, after
Arterberry had rebounded an
awesome Kelley rejection of a
Dave Meyers layup, Patterson
connected on an eight-foot
fallaway, tying the score at 51.
The fans were excited, Dallmar
was anxious and Wooden was
scared.
Fifth Foul
Fifteen seconds later, though,
the Crowd was hushed as referee
Booker Turner pointed an
accusing finger at Kelley, who was
sprawled on the ground after
trying to steal the ball from
McCarter. Kelley was charged
with his fifth foul, and the fans
who gave him a thunderous
standing ovation lost much of
their hope. A Bruin victory
seemed assured.
