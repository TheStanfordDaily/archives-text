Plane Crash Kills 346
PARIS — A packed Turkish jetliner slammed into a
wooded slope and exploded north of Paris yesterday,
spewing debris and bodies for miles in the worst air disaster
in history. An airline official said all 346 aboard were
killed.
"It exploded with a great roar," said a witness.
Bodies hung from trees and parts of bodies were
scattered in the forest around the bits and pieces of the
airship. Six bodies were recovered nine miles from the site.
Argun Yelutas, European manager of Turkish Airlines,
said there were 334 passengers and 12 crewmen aboard the
tri-jet DCIO. He said between 200 and 250 names could be
British or American.
The jetliner was packed because a wildcat strike by
ground engineers at London's Heathrow Airport had forced
British Airways to cancel all its European flights. Turkish
Airlines officials said 216 passengers boarded in Paris for
the last leg of the flight.
"Probably a lot of people who would normally have
traveled with us were on the Turkish jet," a British Airways
spokesman said.
The jet had taken off from Orly Airport five minutes
earlier after a stop on its flight from Istanbul to London.
Yelutas said the takeoff was normal and the skies clear, but
when the plane reached 13,000 feet, "there was no more
news."
Several witnesses said they saw the plane burst into
flames after it crashed. Others said they heard an explosion,
but it could not be determined whether it was before or
after the wide-bodied jet hit the ground.
There was no immediate indication of sabotage,
although a Turkish official said he was not ruling it out.
Rescue workers continued poking into the turf as night
fell, finding only bright magazine pictures, electrical parts
and the endless, meaningless accessories to the lives of the
346 people.
Heath May Resign
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath has failed to
win the support he needs from the Liberal party to stay in
office, and he will resign soon, a senior politician in Heath's
Conservative party said last night.
The source, who was informed about discussions Heath
held with his cabinet, said Queen Elizabeth II is now
expected to ask Harold Wilson, leader of the opposition
Labor party, to form a government when Heath resigns.
Wilson returned from his farm outside London last night
to await a summons from the queen, perhaps as early as
today. His Labor party won the most seats in Thursday's
general election but fell short of a parliamentary majority.
The Conservative informant said Jeremy Thorpe's
Liberal party, which holds the balance of power in the new
Parliament, had rejected Heath's offer of a coalition, and
that Heath had called in senior cabinet officers last night to
inform them of the Liberals' decision.
His chances of clinging to the office appeared slim as the
British press, striking coal miners and other trade unions
began a "Heath Must Go" campaign. Four out of the seven
British national newspapers said in Sunday editorials that
Heath should quit.
Grand Jury Reports Revealed
WASHINGTON — Two subjects of the sealed grand jury
report on President Nixon involve discussion of executive
clemency and the raising of hush money, sources indicated
yesterday.
The 50-page report was handed to U.S. District Judge
John J. Sirica Friday by a grand jury that also indicted
seven former Nixon aides and campaign officials for
allegedly trying to block the investigation of the Watergate

break-in.
It was learned that the 23-member grand jury which
spent 20 months investigating the break-in and cover-up
was determined to take some action based upon its findings
concerning the President.
The panel finally voted to give a secret report to Sirica
with a recommendation he pass it to the House
impeachment inquiry. Special Watergate prosecutor Leon
Jaworski advised the jurors that the House was the proper
forum for any action against the President.
Sirica could decide as early as today whether to follow
the grand jury's recommendation.
Newsweek magazine said yesterday that Jaworski's staff
believed that Nixon, having heard discussion of the
hush-money payments, was at the very least "liable to a
charge of misprision of a felony — failing either to report or
stop the commission of a crime."
Judge to Rule on Mitchell, Stan*
NEW YORK •— A judge is expected to rule today
whether the criminal conspiracy case against former Atty.
Gen. John M. Mitchell and ex-Commerce Secretary Maurice
H. Stans should be declared a mistrial.
A motion for a mistrial was made Friday after Asst. U.S.
Attorney James W. Rayhill instructed jury members in his
opening statement they should put themselves in the place
of grand jurors who indicted the two ex-Cabinet officers.
The defense objected, contending the statement was
prejudicial in that it implied the trial jurors should infer
guilt from the indictment.
Actually, indictments are only accusations and not
findings of guilt. It is up to the prosecutor to prove guilt in
a case.
U.S. District Court Judge Lee P. Gagliardi said Rayhill's
remarks contained "apparent excesses." He ordered the
prosecutor and defense attorneys to file statements over the
weekend on the mistrial motion.
Gagliardi suspended the historic trial and continued to
sequester the jury of eight men and four women.
Announcement of last week's Watergate indictments in
Washington had been held up until the jury was sequestered
Thursday. Mitchell was named in one of these indictments.
Kissinger Arrives in Germany
BONN, Germany — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger arrived here last night, expecting a breakthrough
in the deadlocked European security conference
negotiations in Geneva.
After sue months of virtual intransigence between East
and West, both sides are not prepared to make concessions
according to a senior American official in the Kissinger
entourage.
Kissinger was to confer with Foreign Minister Walter
Scheel and Chancellor Willy Brandt.
In further developments, Brandt's Social Democratic
Party lost its majority in Hamburg's city-state parliament
for the first time since 1957 in voting yesterday.
It was the first voter test of Brandt's popularity since his
re-election in 1972.
Brandt's Socialists remain the largest party in their
traditional north German strong-hold, but lost 14 seats,
dropping to 56 seats in the 120-seat parliament.
The Socialists must now depend on their smaller but
strengthened coalition partner the Free Democratic party.
The two parties also are allied in Brandt's Bonn coalition.
