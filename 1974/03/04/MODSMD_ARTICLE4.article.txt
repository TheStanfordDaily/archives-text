# Seid Examines Asian Counseling
## 
### ED MATHENY 
Dr. Allan Seid, a Palo Alto psychiatrist who
joined the Cowell Health Center staff in January, is
conducting a six-month study to assess the need of
counseling services for Asian students. There is no
full-time Asian counselor now at Cowell.
The study is only a month old, and Seid is not
yet prepared to offer any specific conclusions.
However, after a few weeks on the project, he is
already impressed by "a very definite need" for
such counseling services.
"I don't have all the data in yet, but even in the
short time that I have been in the study of this
matter, it seems clear to me that the needs are
enormous," says Seid. "It is a wonder to me that
Stanford has not really addressed itself specifically
to these needs up to now, because I don't see that
this is a problem that just arose over the last year."
Slight Usage
To date, Asian usage of Cowell's counseling
facilities has been slight. Says Seid: "What I
understand, and these figures are rough, is that there
are about nine percent Asian students on the
campus, and only about three to four percent usage
of the counseling services by Asian students."
Seid notes this brings up the question of whether
the counseling services promote participation by
Asian students.

"I can only share some of the thoughts of some
of the contacts I've made, and it seems to me that
many of the Asian students don't feel comfortable
with some of the counselors who aren't Asians," he
says. "They seem to indicate a lack of sensitivity to
their specific presentation of the problem, a lack of
sensitivity in being able to respond in a way that's
helpful."
Need Cited
Seid cites the need for a counseling service
sensitive to the unique situations faced by both
Asian-American and foreign Asian students. "I hope
to be able to delineate in clear, specific ways what
are the unique needs of these two populations, and
maybe give some preliminary thoughts on how these
specific needs might best be addressed."
A Chinese-American born in San Francisco, Seid
spends roughly half of his working week here. Part
of his time is spent in clinical services at Cowell,
where he is a counselor for the general student
population. The remainder is used talking to Asian
students throughout the campus. Through these
interviews, he hopes to assess the need for
Asian-counseling at Cowell.
Since January, Seid has been steadily building
contact with Stanford's Asian community. Reaching
foreign Asian students is particularly difficult:
"They tend to be graduate students and they're

spread all over off campus. It's a slow process of
contacting one after another by word of mouth or
by referral," says Seid. "Thus far the contacts have
been much more with Asian American
undergraduates."
Community Service
Apart from his private practice, Seid, 38, has a
sizeable history of community service and
involvement. He is chairman of the Santa Clara
County chapter of Asian Americans for Community
Involvement, and is a commissioner for the Santa
Clara County Human Relations Commission. He has
served as a member of the Palo Alto Community
Drug Abuse Board, and has been chairman of the
Santa Clara County Medical Society Drug Abuse
Committee
Seid expects his study to be helpful in
determining the needs for Asian counseling at
Cowell. "I believe that the University, through
hiring me, is serious about attempting to find out
information concerning the counseling needs of
Asian students— it's on that premise that I decided
to come on to Stanford," says Seid."Dr. [David]
Dorosin, head of the counseling service, has spoken
to me specifically about the fact that he is planning
to use the data, so it's not going to be something to
be put on the shelf."

Seid expects his study to be helpful in
determining the needs for Asian counseling at
Cowell. "I believe that the University, through
hiring me, is serious about attempting to find out
information concerning the counseling needs of
Asian students— it's on that premise that I decided
to come on to Stanford," says Seid."Dr. [David]
Dorosin, head of the counseling service, has spoken
to me specifically about the fact that he is planning
to use the data, so it's not going to be something to
be put on the shelf."
Dr. Allan Seid, a Palo Alto psychiatrist who
joined the Cowell Health Center staff in January, is
conducting a six-month study to assess the need of
counseling services for Asian students. There is no
full-time Asian counselor now at Cowell.
The study is only a month old, and Seid is not
yet prepared to offer any specific conclusions.
However, after a few weeks on the project, he is
already impressed by "a very definite need" for
such counseling services.
"I don't have all the data in yet, but even in the
short time that I have been in the study of this
matter, it seems clear to me that the needs are
enormous," says Seid. "It is a wonder to me that
Stanford has not really addressed itself specifically
to these needs up to now, because I don't see that
this is a problem that just arose over the last year."
Slight Usage
To date, Asian usage of Cowell's counseling
facilities has been slight. Says Seid: "What I
understand, and these figures are rough, is that there
are about nine percent Asian students on the
campus, and only about three to four percent usage
of the counseling services by Asian students."
Seid notes this brings up the question of whether
the counseling services promote participation by
Asian students.

"I can only share some of the thoughts of some
of the contacts I've made, and it seems to me that
many of the Asian students don't feel comfortable
with some of the counselors who aren't Asians," he
says. "They seem to indicate a lack of sensitivity to
their specific presentation of the problem, a lack of
sensitivity in being able to respond in a way that's
helpful."
Need Cited
Seid cites the need for a counseling service
sensitive to the unique situations faced by both
Asian-American and foreign Asian students. "I hope
to be able to delineate in clear, specific ways what
are the unique needs of these two populations, and
maybe give some preliminary thoughts on how these
specific needs might best be addressed."
A Chinese-American born in San Francisco, Seid
spends roughly half of his working week here. Part
of his time is spent in clinical services at Cowell,
where he is a counselor for the general student
population. The remainder is used talking to Asian
students throughout the campus. Through these
interviews, he hopes to assess the need for
Asian-counseling at Cowell.
Since January, Seid has been steadily building
contact with Stanford's Asian community. Reaching
foreign Asian students is particularly difficult:
"They tend to be graduate students and they're

spread all over off campus. It's a slow process of
contacting one after another by word of mouth or
by referral," says Seid. "Thus far the contacts have
been much more with Asian American
undergraduates."
Community Service
Apart from his private practice, Seid, 38, has a
sizeable history of community service and
involvement. He is chairman of the Santa Clara
County chapter of Asian Americans for Community
Involvement, and is a commissioner for the Santa
Clara County Human Relations Commission. He has
served as a member of the Palo Alto Community
Drug Abuse Board, and has been chairman of the
Santa Clara County Medical Society Drug Abuse
Committee
