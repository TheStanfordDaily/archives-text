# China Seeks New Values: Prof
## PAUL LIN 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
"The change of an economic
system does not automatically spawn
new ideas and unselfish relationships,"
Professor Paul Lin said Friday night in
Annenberg Auditorium, discussing
"China's Strategy for Development
and World System."
Lin, a professor at McGill
University in Canada, taught in the
People's Republic of China and served
as a foreign policy advisor to Premier
Chou En-lai. He is a delegate to the
Chinese National People's Congress.
Lin contrasted China's stress on
human values to the economic
revolution of the Soviet Union. "It is
not only necessary to have a
revolution in economic systems; it is
also necessary to have a revolution in
values," he said.
Western attempts to understand
China, according to Lin, have recently
changed from "formulajting a policy of
dealing with China" to "regarding
China as a field of human endeavor
experimenting on a scale ... unique to
human society."
Economic Advancement
He said that the basic problems of
economic advancement are the same in
China as in the western world, but that
the goals are different in China.

China, Lin explained, is
approaching the problem of
industrialization from a lower level of
productivity and with a set of social
values which he says are more than
political rhetoric.
"Power to the People" Lin defined
as "actual and direct participation of
the people themselves in seeking
emancipation. Each individual, Lin
said, can actively make the
government work.
"The new power force should not
impose rule, but should be a leadership
which serves the people," Lin said. He
said that through this approach to
government, the Chinese people have
been able to internalize the value of
putting others' interests before their
own.
Self-Reliance
Finally, the slogan "Self-reliance"
reinforces these other values.
"Self-reliance makes it possible to
move along an independent path
without the control of a metropolitan
power," Lin said.
Lin said that this combination of
values has enabled China to deal with
the goals of creating an economic
system not based on exploitation, a
more equitable system for producing
and distributing wealth, a popular
culture in which the people

participate, and an ecologically sound
environment in the process of
industrialization.
"The change in the people is more
basic than struggles among
superpowers," said Lin. The people, he
explained, are fighting against an old
value system which blocked
advancement.
Lin described China as a complex
society in rapid transition. He said the
current movement criticizing
Confucious is "a final spurt of rational
critique to get non-progressive ideas
out of the way."
