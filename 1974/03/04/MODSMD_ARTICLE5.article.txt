# Compulsory Gas Plan Goes Into Effect Today
## 
### MEREDITH HEISER 
Starting today, a mandatory
odd-even gasoline rationing plan goes
into effect in San Mateo and Santa
Clara Counties. The purpose of the
plan is to reduce lines at service
stations.
The plan allows drivers whose
license plates end with an odd number
to purchase gas on odd-numbered days
of the month such as the first, third or
fifth. Those plates with
even-numbered final digits may buy
fuel on even-numbered days, such as
today. Zero is considered an even
number. The 31st of the month is a
"free" day when any driver may
purchase gas.
Personalized license plates which do
not end with a number are considered
odd. Cars with out-of-state licenses are

exempt from the regulations, as are
commercial and emergency vehicles.
Gas Limits
Gas will not be sold to any motorist
whose car has more than half a tank of
gas. Drivers must permit service station
attendants to check their fuel gauges.
Also, in an effort to stretch their
supply, service stations will retain the
right to impose an upper limit on the
amount of gas they will sell to a
customer.
The plan, proposed by Gov. Ronald
Reagan, has been adopted by the
boards of supervisors in San Mateo,
Santa Clara and other counties
throughout the state. Many other
states have similar plans.
If at any time local officials decide
that rationing is no longer necessary,
the county may lift the odd-even
restrictions.
Penalties
Dealers and motorists who violate
the plan will be subject to
misdemeanor prosecution with the
maximum legal penalty of a $500 fine
and six months in jail. However,
officials are encouraged to handle
cases by citation.
Gas stations are required by the
plan to post a conspicuous sign or flag
denoting whether gas is available or
not. If flags are used, green means gas
is available to the public (according to
the odd-even plan, yellow means
gasoline for emergency vehicles only
and red means no gasoline).
Local service station dealers are
extremely hopeful the plan will help
shorten lines. Campus Shell Manager

Gary Andrews reports that, "Under its
voluntary status, the odd-even plan
was followed by perhaps 40-50
percent of my customers. But after the
three-day vacation, during the last
weeks of February, the plan fell apart.
Then it was the people abiding by the
plan who were hurt."
Service Hours
A major concern of Andrews and
other station managers is how to
enforce the plan. All local station
managers are asking for customer
cooperation, to assure the plan will
run smoothly.
Andrews, who is being allotted 60
percent of the amount of fuel he used
in March 1972 for this month, is
shortening his hours to 9 a.m. to
11:30 a.m. on week days so he will
have enough gas for the whole month.
Service stations are being
encouraged to stagger their hours and
make arrangements to space out sales
so that there will not be shortages on
week ends, nights or at the end of the
month. However, the "appointment"
system being tried by various stations
throughout the county will not be
legal and will not be in effect.
The Economic Opportunity
Commission of San Mateo County has
compiled hours of operation, gas
limiting policies, and phone numbers
of nearly 100 gas stations in Redwood
City, Menlo Park and East Palo Alto.
Citizens may telephone either
365-7992 or 365-7993 to find out the
hours of gas stations in South San
Mateo County.
