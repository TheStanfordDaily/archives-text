# Local Voters Decide: School Board, Taxes
## 
### CHRIS TOREM News Analysis 
Palo Alto voters, including Stanford
students, will go to the polls tomorrow
to select a school board member from
a lot of five candidates. Dr. Royce
Cole, the incumbent, is challenged this
year by Joshua Goldstein, Paul Pease,
Alice Statton, and Claire Smith.
At the same time, the voters will
vote yes or no on a controversial tax
"override" that would add $1.5
million to the 1974-75 school budget.
The override ballot asks the district
to take advantage of declining
enrollment and rising property values
by maintaining the current education
property tax of $5.97 per $100
assessed valuation. This would mean
more money for less students. Without
the override, the state ceiling set by
Senate Bill 90 would force Palo Alto
to freeze it's expenditure per ADA and
lower its tax rate to around $5.50 per
ADA.
If the measure passes, Palo Alto will
spend $1,777 per ADA in 1974-75, a
hike of $134 from the 1972-73
expenditure of $1,642 per ADA. If the
ballot fails, the state will only allow a
riase of $30 per ADA as a partial
offset to inflation.
Mass Firings
Advocates of the override say that
if the measure fails, the Board will
have to cut $2.3 million from a
projected budget 28 million and fire

over 130 teachers, administrators, and
staff. If it passes, they say that only
$885,000 will have to be shaved.
Critics of the override point to a
financial fact sheet issued by the
Board. The Board figures, which count
on the override, include a $1 million
five percent cost-of-living pay increase
to all personnel. Because the average
teacher's salary is now $16,500, these
critics wonder why all personnel
couldn't be kept on without a raise.
Board members and School
Superintendent Harold Santee have
admitted that there is no commitment
to a five percent hike.
Then too, there is a moral issue
involved. The ceilings set by state law
on districts that spend more than a
certain foundation amount per ADA
were intended to partially equalize the
quality of statewide pubiic school
education. The foundation level for a
unified district like Palo Alto is $980
per ADA. Even without the override,
Palo Alto would be spending nearly
twice that of a foundation-level
district per ADA.
But advocates of the override have
said that the law was never intended to
destroy quality education. Its purpose
is to restrict expenditures, but also to
allow the taxpayers through "revenue
elections" to bear a greater burden for
the sake of better schools.
