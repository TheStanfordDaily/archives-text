# Local Voters Decide: School Board, Taxes
## 
### CHRIS TOREM News Analysis 
Palo Alto voters, including Stanford
students, will go to the polls tomorrow
to select a school board member from
a lot of five candidates. Dr. Royce
Cole, the incumbent, is challenged this
year by Joshua Goldstein, Paul Pease,
Alice Statton, and Claire Smith.
At the same time, the voters will
vote yes or no on a controversial tax
"override" that would add $1.5
million to the 1974-75 school budget.
The override ballot asks the district
to take advantage of declining
enrollment and rising property values
by maintaining the current education
property tax of $5.97 per $100
assessed valuation. This would mean
more money for less students. Without
the override, the state ceiling set by
Senate Bill 90 would force Palo Alto
to freeze it's expenditure per ADA and
lower its tax rate to around $5.50 per
ADA.
If the measure passes, Palo Alto will
spend $1,777 per ADA in 1974-75, a
hike of $134 from the 1972-73
expenditure of $1,642 per ADA. If the
ballot fails, the state will only allow a
riase of $30 per ADA as a partial
offset to inflation.
Mass Firings
Advocates of the override say that
if the measure fails, the Board will
have to cut $2.3 million from a
projected budget 28 million and fire

over 130 teachers, administrators, and
staff. If it passes, they say that only
$885,000 will have to be shaved.
Critics of the override point to a
financial fact sheet issued by the
Board. The Board figures, which count
on the override, include a $1 million
five percent cost-of-living pay increase
to all personnel. Because the average
teacher's salary is now $16,500, these
critics wonder why all personnel
couldn't be kept on without a raise.
Board members and School
Superintendent Harold Santee have
admitted that there is no commitment
to a five percent hike.
Then too, there is a moral issue
involved. The ceilings set by state law
on districts that spend more than a
certain foundation amount per ADA
were intended to partially equalize the
quality of statewide pubiic school
education. The foundation level for a
unified district like Palo Alto is $980
per ADA. Even without the override,
Palo Alto would be spending nearly
twice that of a foundation-level
district per ADA.
But advocates of the override have
said that the law was never intended to
destroy quality education. Its purpose
is to restrict expenditures, but also to
allow the taxpayers through "revenue
elections" to bear a greater burden for
the sake of better schools.
Since all of the candidates except
underdog Claire Smith support the

override, this year's School Board seat
is likely to go to the candidate with
the best image, who seems most
responsive to the needs of voters.
Cole, a 43-year-old conservative
Republican who ran unsuccessfully
against Rep. Paul McCloskey in the
1972 primary, has advocated budget
reductions and strongly urged that
innovative programs, such as
multi-cultural Human Relations, be
more firmly anchored in a structured
curriculum.
In answer to charges that the Board
has been unresponsive to the
community, Cole has said that he was
the only member to vote against
closed executive sessions on district
priorities.
Cooperation, not Competition
Long-haired Joshua Goldstein, a 21
year-old researcher at the Stanford
Institute for Political Studies, is the
only candidate who went through the
Palo Alto school system.
He has run a grass-roots campaign
using both volunteers and leaflets, and
his theme has been that "cooperation,
not competition" is the proper spirit
for learning. He had advocated cuts in
administration salaries and personnel,
and the use of empty classrooms for
community needs (such as senior
citizens centers and child-care) as
means of keeping the school budget

within bounds.
The campaigns of two other
candidates, Paul Pease and Alice
Stratton, have been less clearly
defined. Both are relative newcomers
to the area.
Pease, president of a local
advertising agency, has said that he
wants to serve as a representative of
the community and to support
"individualized needs" of the student
body. One of his first tasks if elected,
he has said, would be to institute a
series of studies to determine
enrollment and growth needs in the
coming years.
Social worker Stratton, like Pease,
has campaigned on a program of
greater fiscal responsibility. She has
advocated a greater role for the PTA
and a slowed-down rate of change. She
said that new programs should be
instituted "not for change's sake, but
for the child's sake."
The most radical of the
campaigners, Claire Smith, has
attacked the present school system as
being "racist" and "capitalist" because
of what she called "the absence of a
curriculum which takes into account
the history and culture of Third World
peoples." Smith, a staff member at a
Palo Alto community drug abuse
project, has said that one of her goals
would be to deal with student
alienation and powerlessness.

body. One of his first tasks if elected,
he has said, would be to institute a
series of studies to determine
enrollment and growth needs in the
coming years.
Social worker Stratton, like Pease,
has campaigned on a program of
greater fiscal responsibility. She has
advocated a greater role for the PTA
and a slowed-down rate of change. She
said that new programs should be
instituted "not for change's sake, but
for the child's sake."
The most radical of the
campaigners, Claire Smith, has
attacked the present school system as
being "racist" and "capitalist" because
of what she called "the absence of a
curriculum which takes into account
the history and culture of Third World
peoples." Smith, a staff member at a
Palo Alto community drug abuse
project, has said that one of her goals
would be to deal with student
alienation and powerlessness.
Palo Alto voters, including Stanford
students, will go to the polls tomorrow
to select a school board member from
a lot of five candidates. Dr. Royce
Cole, the incumbent, is challenged this
year by Joshua Goldstein, Paul Pease,
Alice Statton, and Claire Smith.
At the same time, the voters will
vote yes or no on a controversial tax
"override" that would add $1.5
million to the 1974-75 school budget.
The override ballot asks the district
to take advantage of declining
enrollment and rising property values
by maintaining the current education
property tax of $5.97 per $100
assessed valuation. This would mean
more money for less students. Without
the override, the state ceiling set by
Senate Bill 90 would force Palo Alto
to freeze it's expenditure per ADA and
lower its tax rate to around $5.50 per
ADA.
If the measure passes, Palo Alto will
spend $1,777 per ADA in 1974-75, a
hike of $134 from the 1972-73
expenditure of $1,642 per ADA. If the
ballot fails, the state will only allow a
riase of $30 per ADA as a partial
offset to inflation.
Mass Firings
Advocates of the override say that
if the measure fails, the Board will
have to cut $2.3 million from a
projected budget 28 million and fire

over 130 teachers, administrators, and
staff. If it passes, they say that only
$885,000 will have to be shaved.
Critics of the override point to a
financial fact sheet issued by the
Board. The Board figures, which count
on the override, include a $1 million
five percent cost-of-living pay increase
to all personnel. Because the average
teacher's salary is now $16,500, these
critics wonder why all personnel
couldn't be kept on without a raise.
Board members and School
Superintendent Harold Santee have
admitted that there is no commitment
to a five percent hike.
Then too, there is a moral issue
involved. The ceilings set by state law
on districts that spend more than a
certain foundation amount per ADA
were intended to partially equalize the
quality of statewide pubiic school
education. The foundation level for a
unified district like Palo Alto is $980
per ADA. Even without the override,
Palo Alto would be spending nearly
twice that of a foundation-level
district per ADA.
But advocates of the override have
said that the law was never intended to
destroy quality education. Its purpose
is to restrict expenditures, but also to
allow the taxpayers through "revenue
elections" to bear a greater burden for
the sake of better schools.

the best image, who seems most
responsive to the needs of voters.
Cole, a 43-year-old conservative
Republican who ran unsuccessfully
against Rep. Paul McCloskey in the
1972 primary, has advocated budget
reductions and strongly urged that
innovative programs, such as
multi-cultural Human Relations, be
more firmly anchored in a structured
curriculum.

has been unresponsive to the

the only member to vote against
closed executive sessions on district
priorities.

Long-haired Joshua Goldstein, a 21
year-old researcher at the Stanford
Institute for Political Studies, is the
only candidate who went through the
Palo Alto school system.
He has run a grass-roots campaign
using both volunteers and leaflets, and
his theme has been that "cooperation,
not competition" is the proper spirit
for learning. He had advocated cuts in
administration salaries and personnel,
and the use of empty classrooms for
community needs (such as senior
citizens centers and child-care) as
means of keeping the school budget

within bounds.
The campaigns of two other
candidates, Paul Pease and Alice
Stratton, have been less clearly
defined. Both are relative newcomers
to the area.

Long-haired Joshua Goldstein, a 21
year-old researcher at the Stanford
Institute for Political Studies, is the
only candidate who went through the
Palo Alto school system.
He has run a grass-roots campaign
using both volunteers and leaflets, and
his theme has been that "cooperation,
not competition" is the proper spirit
for learning. He had advocated cuts in
administration salaries and personnel,
and the use of empty classrooms for
community needs (such as senior
citizens centers and child-care) as
means of keeping the school budget

within bounds.
The campaigns of two other
candidates, Paul Pease and Alice
Stratton, have been less clearly
defined. Both are relative newcomers
to the area.
Pease, president of a local
advertising agency, has said that he
wants to serve as a representative of
the community and to support
"individualized needs" of the student
body. One of his first tasks if elected,
he has said, would be to institute a
series of studies to determine
enrollment and growth needs in the
coming years.
Social worker Stratton, like Pease,
has campaigned on a program of
greater fiscal responsibility. She has
advocated a greater role for the PTA
and a slowed-down rate of change. She
said that new programs should be
instituted "not for change's sake, but
for the child's sake."
The most radical of the
campaigners, Claire Smith, has
attacked the present school system as
being "racist" and "capitalist" because
of what she called "the absence of a
curriculum which takes into account
the history and culture of Third World
peoples." Smith, a staff member at a
Palo Alto community drug abuse
project, has said that one of her goals
would be to deal with student
alienation and powerlessness.
Palo Alto voters, including Stanford
students, will go to the polls tomorrow
to select a school board member from
a lot of five candidates. Dr. Royce
Cole, the incumbent, is challenged this
year by Joshua Goldstein, Paul Pease,
Alice Statton, and Claire Smith.
At the same time, the voters will
vote yes or no on a controversial tax
"override" that would add $1.5
million to the 1974-75 school budget.
The override ballot asks the district
to take advantage of declining
enrollment and rising property values
by maintaining the current education
property tax of $5.97 per $100
assessed valuation. This would mean
more money for less students. Without
the override, the state ceiling set by
Senate Bill 90 would force Palo Alto
to freeze it's expenditure per ADA and
lower its tax rate to around $5.50 per
ADA.
If the measure passes, Palo Alto will
spend $1,777 per ADA in 1974-75, a
hike of $134 from the 1972-73
expenditure of $1,642 per ADA. If the
ballot fails, the state will only allow a
riase of $30 per ADA as a partial
offset to inflation.
Mass Firings
Advocates of the override say that
if the measure fails, the Board will
have to cut $2.3 million from a
projected budget 28 million and fire

over 130 teachers, administrators, and
staff. If it passes, they say that only
$885,000 will have to be shaved.
Critics of the override point to a
financial fact sheet issued by the
Board. The Board figures, which count
on the override, include a $1 million
five percent cost-of-living pay increase
to all personnel. Because the average
teacher's salary is now $16,500, these
critics wonder why all personnel
couldn't be kept on without a raise.
Board members and School
Superintendent Harold Santee have
admitted that there is no commitment
to a five percent hike.
Then too, there is a moral issue
involved. The ceilings set by state law
on districts that spend more than a
certain foundation amount per ADA
were intended to partially equalize the
quality of statewide pubiic school
education. The foundation level for a
unified district like Palo Alto is $980
per ADA. Even without the override,
Palo Alto would be spending nearly
twice that of a foundation-level
district per ADA.
But advocates of the override have
said that the law was never intended to
destroy quality education. Its purpose
is to restrict expenditures, but also to
allow the taxpayers through "revenue
elections" to bear a greater burden for
the sake of better schools.

underdog Claire Smith support the

override, this year's School Board seat
is likely to go to the candidate with
the best image, who seems most
responsive to the needs of voters.
Cole, a 43-year-old conservative
Republican who ran unsuccessfully
against Rep. Paul McCloskey in the
1972 primary, has advocated budget
reductions and strongly urged that
innovative programs, such as
multi-cultural Human Relations, be
more firmly anchored in a structured
curriculum.
In answer to charges that the Board
has been unresponsive to the
community, Cole has said that he was
the only member to vote against
closed executive sessions on district
priorities.
