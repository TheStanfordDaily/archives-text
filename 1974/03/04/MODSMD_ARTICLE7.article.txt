Support School Measure
Editor:
The Lucille M. Nixon
Parent-Faculty Group urges all
students registered to vote in
Santa Clara County to vote YES
on the ballot measure to continue
for one year the present operating
tax rate of $5.96 to generate the
income needed to maintain Palo
Alto Unified School District
standards.
The election, to be held
Tuesday, March 5, is necessary
due to a new California law,
Senate Bill 90, which sets a
state-specified, per-pupil spending
limit for every school district.
Any monies raised beyond that
limit must be specifically
approved by the community in a
special revenue base election.
While this law guarantees districts
with low property values a "fair
shake," it allows excellent
districts such as PAUSD to retain
that excellence if residents wish to
spend the money.
If the ballot measure fails,
some $2,300,000 would have to
be cut from programs in the
District. Here are some of the
things that would be affected:
— elimination of 94
certificated and 65 classified
employees
— special programs for children
with behavioral and learning
difficulties
— at least one elementary
school might be closed and the
remaining schools might increase
class sizes to 26.5 students per
teacher as compared to the
present average of 25.5
— elimination of specialists in
physical education, art, music and
library skills who provide
instruction at the elementary
level.
The Nixon Parent Group feels
that these facts are important. 1)
The election does not raise the
Palo Alto tax rate. Only if a
property happened to be
reassessed in the coming year
would the property owner pay
more tax next year. 2) This is a
one-year measure only, which will
give the district time in which to
assess its educational priorities
and meet the demands of new
legislation. 3) If the election fails,
taxes on a $45,000 home will go
down around $40, but the effect
on PAUSD will be disastrous.

No Honey Shots
Editor:
To prevent misunderstanding,
if we can: The TV crew cruising
around the campus Tuesday and
Wednesday March 5 and 6 is not
here to get honey shots. Their
assignment is to videotape
Stanford scenes with people in
them for the Public Broadcasting
Service.
Some of these scenes, a taping
of the Stanford Chorus, and the
lecture by Prof. Vermont Royster
in Dinkelspiel on Wednesday
evening will all come together in
one of the programs for the
Distinguished Lecture Series to be
carried on National Educational
Television.
Pass the word.

Library Associates
Editor:
Recently there appeared in the
Daily an exceptionally fine article
by Cynthia Cima, detailing the
serious space and financial
problems faced by Stanford's
libraries. I would like to add a bit
more about the Library

Associates, a newly founded
support group with the potential
to help the University in a very
meaningful way.
Like most "friends" groups,
the Associates aim to help
purchase unusual research
materials which the University
could otherwise not afford. Such
rare books and manuscripts add
immeasurably to the depth which
makes ours a great research
library.
Hopefully more students (and
faculty) at all levels will take this
opportunity to help our very fine,
but fiscally beleagured library
system by joining the Associates.
The student membership fee is
$10 and can be submitted to
Ralph Hansen at the Main
Library.

SLA Article
Editor:
The article in the Feb. 21 Daily
by Smith and Garvin reflects the
growing misuse of the press by
official sources hoping to sell their
story to the public. In this case,
the authors report at length on
the claims of California prison
officials with respect to the
impact of the SLA and other
radical groups on prison inmates.
Prison officials have seized
upon the notoriety of the SLA to
spread their line that a vast radical
conspiracy to organize murderous
prison gangs is at the heart of
recent waves of prison violence. In
articles syndicated around the
country by Copley News Service
and other conservative news
sources, prison officials and the
House Internal Security
Committee have claimed that
Venceremos, actually a disbanded
radical organization, is still
secretly at work inflaming
otherwise docile prisoners and
organizing them into guerilla
bands. Garvin and Smith fail to
present any corroborating
evidence for these charges.
Should the claims of California
prison officials be taken at face
value? Not unlike the red-baiters
of the 19505, they have a
powerful vested interest in
frightening the public with their
conspiracy theories. They hope to
win greater appropriations from
the State Legislature for security.
They hope to divert public
attention from brutal prison
conditions which are made even
crueler by the present prison
lockdown. Above all, they hope
to be able to explain future
Atticas when they happen — and
they inevitably will.
Smith and Garvin would have
done Daily readers a much greater
service by asking criminologists,
sociologists, lawyers and
ex-prisoners what they considered
to be the ultimate sources of
prison violence. There is
increasing evidence that grim and
crowded prisons, indeterminate
sentences, arbitrary parole terms,
solitary confinement, and strip
cells drive prisoners to violence
and insanity. Until prison
conditions and the criminal justice
system are radically changed,
prison violence will inevitably
continue. And no amount of
inflammatory talk of prisoner
conspiracies can change that fact.

KZSU Refund
Editor:
Now that KZSU's (revised)
power increased application has
been turned down, when are they
going to refund the fee
assessments they collected to pay
for new equipment no longer
needed?
