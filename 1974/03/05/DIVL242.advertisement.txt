The search.
Some come to find meaning. Not only from the wise men with deep
answers. But from the country itself with its ancient past and new spirit, and its
JMM people in touch with others and themselves.
, Some come hungry for India's beauty.The storied art and
architecture. The pageantry. The incredible landscape.
Some come here because it's different. Or because it's far
BIHBI awa y- Or because others come here.
What are you searching for? We'll offer you everything to
Jm help you in your search. An incredibly low $577 round-trip
are om New York to Bombay or Delhi. Places to eat and
I sleep that cost less than anywhere (in India the dollar still goes
far and $5.00 a day isn't nostalgia, yet). Half fare on domestic
air, and rail travel. Wholehearted hospitality.
We've a Meet-The-People Program so that you can visit
with an Indian family if you like. A Student Program to introduce you to
Indian students on their campuses. But quite on your own you'll make friends,
be offered help and understanding, get invited places.
We enjoy having you.
