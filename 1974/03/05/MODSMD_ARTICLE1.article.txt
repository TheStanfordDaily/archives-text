# Lines Vary At Palo Alto Gas Stations
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Odd-even gasoline rationing became
law in Santa Clara county yesterday,
but local gas-station operators
disagreed over the success of the plan's
first day.
Of five Palo Alto station managers
surveyed, only one reported shorter
waiting lines, while two noticed no
change and two claimed that lines
were longer than they had been under
the old voluntary rationing plan.
A spokesperson for the county's
Emergency Services office, which is
handling information about the plan,
said that their switchboard had been
flooded all day. "Everyone's
confused," she claimed. "Most of the
service stations don't understand the
plan, so it probably won't be fully
effective for another week."
The manager of Stanford Mobil
Service on Arboretum Road reported
"much shorter" lines at his station.
"The plan really helps the lines," he
said. "There have been very few
shenanigans, because everyone knows
it's up to them to make the plan work.

Motorists may telephone the
Economic Opportunity Commission of
San Mateo County at either 365-7792
or 365-7793 to find out the operating
hours of gas stations in southern San
Mateo County.
The phone numbers printed in
yesterday's Daily were incorrect.

"I was a little worried because the
plan is working badly up in Oregon,
but I'm confident that itTl work here.
We have more gas," he added.
Stanford Union Service's manager
said waiting lines there were
substantially longer today than on
previous Mondays. "Since it's an even
day, everyone that's got an even plate
figures he'd better get gas when he
c*n," stated the manager. "I can't say
wnether the plan will work in the long
run, but it certainly made the situation
worse today."
A Campus Shell employee also
reported longer-than-usual lines this
morning. "The fact that we ran out of
gas after only an hour and a half didn't
help the situation," he noted.
"Monday is always the worst day, and
it was worse today."
"I could give you the license
number of a jerk who just tried to run
me over," claimed an employee of
Hudson Oil on El Camino. He cited
normal 15 to 20 minute waiting lines,
but also mentioned a number of irate
customers with odd-numbered
licenses.
"Most people knew about the
rationing, but we had to turn a few
away becuase of the law," he
commented. "There are always a few
ding-a-lings who never know about
anything."
Fill-'em-Fast Self-Service on El
Camino had its usual 45 to 50 minute
lines yesterday, according to its
manager. "The rationing plan sure
hasn't solved our waiting problem," he
said.
"I think we're dealing with fairly
intelligent people," he added. "Sure,
there were people who told me they
didn't remember their license plate
numbers and other such nonsense, but
most of the people we had to turn
away didn't make any fuss. We tried to
tell them before they waited too long,
and in most cases it was an honest
misunderstanding."

yesterday. The station pictured above reported little change from the 40 to 50 minute waits since the voluntary rationing
system began.
