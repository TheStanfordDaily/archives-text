# Nixon A Liability To Republicans
##

Last Friday's Watergate grand jury
indictments drew perilously close to
implicating President Nixon in clearly illegal
activities, including obstruction of justice.
The indictments — as well as the sealed,
50-page document presented to Judge Sirica
by the grand jury — may have set the stage
for a titanic struggle for political survival
between the President and leaders of his own
party.
Increasingly, Republicans are coming to
view Nixon as an extraordinary liability to
their electoral prospects both for this year
and for 1976.
Political observers regard the string of
special congressional elections being held
across the country this winter as an indicator
of how deeply the American people feel
about Watergate, Nixon, the Republican
Party and any connection between the three.
Ford's Lost Seat
The election of a Democrat to Gerald
Ford's House seat, which had been safely in
Republican hands for 60 years, seemed to
indicate that the Republicans are in deeper
trouble than many had originally believed.
Special congressional elections will be held
in two other traditionally Republican
districts today, and if the GOP loses
either one — or both — sentiment for
impeachment among House Republicans may
be bolstered significantly.
The elections — one each in California and

Ohio — will be the first since the grand jury
indictments were revealed and politicians will
probably watch each closely, hoping to
discern how significantly public opinion has
been affected.
Republicanism And Watergate
In the Ohio race, the Republican
candidate appeared to be running behind
even before the indictments, according to
The New York Times, "because many of the
voters seemed to be equating [Republican
candidate Willis D.] Gradison with
Republicanism, with the Nixon
Administration and with Watergate."
In the California election, where seven
Democrats are trying to force the lone
Republican candidate into a run-off by
denying him a majority of the votes today,
GOP State Sen. Robert J. Lagomarsino is
taking pains to disassociate himself from
Watergate: "That's not an issue here. I'm not
a part of that," he said.
If Gradison and Lagomarsino lose — or
make a poor showing in today's special
elections, it may convince leading
Republicans, both in and out of the House of
Representatives, that they can no longer
afford to keep Nixon in the White House.
In his press conference last Monday,
Nixon bluntly placed his own interests above
those of the Republican Party, saying "I
want my party to survive, but more
importantly I want the presidency to

survive."
Battle For Survival
Nixon restated his belief that he would
not be impeached and stressed that he would
not resign. And so the issue is joined: a
President and a major political party
essentially battling each other for survival.
Since all except the most die-hard
elements of the Democratic Party are
reluctant to take as drastic a step as
impeachment, Republican leaders, including
the big money men who set up Nixon's
reelection two years ago, may try to persuade
the President to resign.
If they fail, as seems likely from the
President's consistent rhetoric, an
impeachment drive led by Republicans may
be the only logical alternative.
Eight more special elections are scheduled
after today, but concerned Republicans may
not wait for the returns to come in on all of
them before making their move.
They are looking with particular anxiety
at poll results from the Michigan
congressional election which revealed that 60
percent of those who voted for the victorious
Democratic candidate did so essentially
because he was not a Republican, even
though they regarded him as less qualified
than his GOP rival.
