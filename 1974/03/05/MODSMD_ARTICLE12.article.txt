# Graduate Students And Unions
## 
### 
Raymond Meyer §

Authors as disparate as John
Cardinal Newman, Thorstein
Veblen and the students who
wrote The Other Stanford all
assume that the proper purpose of
a university is to foster
independent, critical and creative
thought.
But that attainment to the
intellectual adulthood considered
to be the true end of a university
education is by no means the rule
among undergraduate or graduate
students at Stanford will hardly
be disputed by these students or
by the faculty that teaches them.
But it might be argued, and
indeed has been argued, that it is
not in the interest of the
contemporary American
university that the students
trained and educated by it
become intellectual adults. For if
they were capable of critical and
independent thought, they might
ask themselves about the
implications of what they are
taught and may themselves
someday teach, about the
presuppositions and consequences
of the way something is taught,
and about what interests in
American society the university
actually serves.
Passivity And Alientation
But be that as it may, an
important cause, as well as a
correlate, of the intellectual
adolescence widespread among
students at all levels is certainly
the passivity and alientation that
pervades their relationship to the
courses they take, with the
teachers of these courses, with
their department and with the
university. Students seldom have
any significant say about what
will be taught or how it will be
taught.
All too often they work for the
professor, in that they offer their
work in exchange for professorial
approval, in the form of an
acceptable grade. This approval, in
the form of an acceptable grade, is
emphasized to such a degree by
the total context of

post-secondary education that
mastery of the material easily
becomes a transient and
transparent means to obtain this
end.
The issue is more pointed when
graduate students have no
effective voice in setting their
department's curriculum, no
effective voice in the hiring of
new faculty or no effective voice
in the selection of their fellow
students. Nor do graduate
students always participate in the
assignment of the teaching posts
on which many, if not most of
them, depend for their livelihood.
Self-De termination
The detrimental effect of this
alienation of students from their
own education, and the passivity
concomitant of it, is manifest.
The most effective and perhaps
the only remedy for this
undesirable situation is the
students' appropriation of their
education by achieving a
significant measure of
self-determination of their
education in all its aspects.
Enlightened faculty would
welcome student self-determina
tion and true student
participation in the affairs of the
departments and the university,
for correlative of such
self-determination and such
participation would be increased
intellectual maturity and a
heightened sense of responsibility
for the success of the scholarly
enterprise and for their own
education.
Far from being an academic
jacquerie, such an assertion of
students' rights — for that is the
only authentic form this
attainment of self-determination
can take — would be a giant stride
toward making of university
students and faculty a real
community of scholars and
seekers of knowledge and
understanding.
'Granted' Rights
The assertion of one's right to
self-determination is the only
authentic way to gain this right
because the granting of a right —

in the true sense of the word
"grant" — is in reality an implicit
annulment of that right. For the
right to grant a right implies the
right to annul that right. Indeed,
in the course of history the
"granting" of rights has been,
with very few exceptions, the
recognition of a claim to those
rights.
But the individual graduate
student obviously has no hope of
successfully asserting a right to
self-determination. Only an
organization of students can do
this effectively. And, since so
many graduate students work as
research or teaching assistants,
and as such stand in a relationship
to the university of employee to
employer, the union is the type of
organization that would best lend
itself to obtaining educational
self-determination for them. For
the union is the strongest kind of
organization available to graduate
students and would serve graduate
student needs well in other

respects.
A union would, for example,
give graduate students an effective
voice in discussing and negotiating
their financial relationship with
the university and their working
conditions. It would also enable
them to establish an efficacious
procedure for examining
grievances and obtaining their
redress.
The RA's of the Physics Dept.
therefore deserve high praise for
their initiative and courage in
undertaking to establish a union
to represent them in their dealings
with Stanford. And one can only
hope for the success of their
efforts to establish a union of
graduate students at Stanford, and
deplore the dilatory tactics with
which Stanford has responded to
the Stanford Union of Research
Physicists' efforts to obtain from
the National Labor Relations
Board a judgment on their case.

effective voice in setting their
department's curriculum, no
effective voice in the hiring of
new faculty or no effective voice
in the selection of their fellow
students. Nor do graduate
students always participate in the
assignment of the teaching posts
on which many, if not most of
them, depend for their livelihood.
Self-De termination
The detrimental effect of this
alienation of students from their
own education, and the passivity
concomitant of it, is manifest.
The most effective and perhaps
the only remedy for this
undesirable situation is the
students' appropriation of their
education by achieving a
significant measure of
self-determination of their
education in all its aspects.
Enlightened faculty would
welcome student self-determina
tion and true student
participation in the affairs of the
departments and the university,
for correlative of such
self-determination and such
participation would be increased
intellectual maturity and a
heightened sense of responsibility
for the success of the scholarly
enterprise and for their own
education.
Far from being an academic
jacquerie, such an assertion of
students' rights — for that is the
only authentic form this
attainment of self-determination
can take — would be a giant stride
toward making of university
students and faculty a real
community of scholars and
seekers of knowledge and
understanding.
'Granted' Rights
The assertion of one's right to
self-determination is the only
authentic way to gain this right
because the granting of a right —

in the true sense of the word
"grant" — is in reality an implicit
annulment of that right. For the
right to grant a right implies the
right to annul that right. Indeed,
in the course of history the
"granting" of rights has been,
with very few exceptions, the
recognition of a claim to those
rights.
But the individual graduate
student obviously has no hope of
successfully asserting a right to
self-determination. Only an
organization of students can do
this effectively. And, since so
many graduate students work as
research or teaching assistants,
and as such stand in a relationship
to the university of employee to
employer, the union is the type of
organization that would best lend
itself to obtaining educational
self-determination for them. For
the union is the strongest kind of
organization available to graduate
students and would serve graduate
student needs well in other

respects.
A union would, for example,
give graduate students an effective
voice in discussing and negotiating
their financial relationship with
the university and their working
conditions. It would also enable
them to establish an efficacious
procedure for examining
grievances and obtaining their
redress.
The RA's of the Physics Dept.
therefore deserve high praise for
their initiative and courage in
undertaking to establish a union
to represent them in their dealings
with Stanford. And one can only
hope for the success of their
efforts to establish a union of
graduate students at Stanford, and
deplore the dilatory tactics with
which Stanford has responded to
the Stanford Union of Research
Physicists' efforts to obtain from
the National Labor Relations
Board a judgment on their case.

Raymond Meyer §

Authors as disparate as John
Cardinal Newman, Thorstein
Veblen and the students who
wrote The Other Stanford all
assume that the proper purpose of
a university is to foster
independent, critical and creative
thought.
But that attainment to the
intellectual adulthood considered
to be the true end of a university
education is by no means the rule
among undergraduate or graduate
students at Stanford will hardly
be disputed by these students or
by the faculty that teaches them.
But it might be argued, and
indeed has been argued, that it is
not in the interest of the
contemporary American
university that the students
trained and educated by it
become intellectual adults. For if
they were capable of critical and
independent thought, they might
ask themselves about the
implications of what they are
taught and may themselves
someday teach, about the
presuppositions and consequences
of the way something is taught,
and about what interests in
American society the university
actually serves.
Passivity And Alientation
But be that as it may, an
important cause, as well as a
correlate, of the intellectual
adolescence widespread among
students at all levels is certainly
the passivity and alientation that
pervades their relationship to the
courses they take, with the
teachers of these courses, with
their department and with the
university. Students seldom have
any significant say about what
will be taught or how it will be
taught.
All too often they work for the
professor, in that they offer their
work in exchange for professorial
approval, in the form of an
acceptable grade. This approval, in
the form of an acceptable grade, is
emphasized to such a degree by
the total context of

post-secondary education that
mastery of the material easily
becomes a transient and
transparent means to obtain this
end.

successfully asserting a right to
self-determination. Only an
organization of students can do
this effectively. And, since so
many graduate students work as
research or teaching assistants,
and as such stand in a relationship
to the university of employee to
employer, the union is the type of
organization that would best lend
itself to obtaining educational
self-determination for them. For
the union is the strongest kind of
organization available to graduate
students and would serve graduate
student needs well in other

respects.
A union would, for example,
give graduate students an effective
voice in discussing and negotiating
their financial relationship with
the university and their working
conditions. It would also enable
them to establish an efficacious
procedure for examining
grievances and obtaining their
redress.
The RA's of the Physics Dept.
therefore deserve high praise for
their initiative and courage in
undertaking to establish a union
to represent them in their dealings
with Stanford. And one can only
hope for the success of their
efforts to establish a union of
graduate students at Stanford, and
deplore the dilatory tactics with
which Stanford has responded to
the Stanford Union of Research
Physicists' efforts to obtain from
the National Labor Relations
Board a judgment on their case.

Raymond Meyer §

Authors as disparate as John
Cardinal Newman, Thorstein
Veblen and the students who
wrote The Other Stanford all
assume that the proper purpose of
a university is to foster
independent, critical and creative
thought.
But that attainment to the
intellectual adulthood considered
to be the true end of a university
education is by no means the rule
among undergraduate or graduate
students at Stanford will hardly
be disputed by these students or
by the faculty that teaches them.
But it might be argued, and
indeed has been argued, that it is
not in the interest of the
contemporary American
university that the students
trained and educated by it
become intellectual adults. For if
they were capable of critical and
independent thought, they might
ask themselves about the
implications of what they are
taught and may themselves
someday teach, about the
presuppositions and consequences
of the way something is taught,
and about what interests in
American society the university
actually serves.
Passivity And Alientation
But be that as it may, an
important cause, as well as a
correlate, of the intellectual
adolescence widespread among
students at all levels is certainly
the passivity and alientation that
pervades their relationship to the
courses they take, with the
teachers of these courses, with
their department and with the
university. Students seldom have
any significant say about what
will be taught or how it will be
taught.
All too often they work for the
professor, in that they offer their
work in exchange for professorial
approval, in the form of an
acceptable grade. This approval, in
the form of an acceptable grade, is
emphasized to such a degree by
the total context of

post-secondary education that
mastery of the material easily
becomes a transient and
transparent means to obtain this
end.
The issue is more pointed when
graduate students have no
effective voice in setting their
department's curriculum, no
effective voice in the hiring of
new faculty or no effective voice
in the selection of their fellow
students. Nor do graduate
students always participate in the
assignment of the teaching posts
on which many, if not most of
them, depend for their livelihood.
Self-De termination
The detrimental effect of this
alienation of students from their
own education, and the passivity
concomitant of it, is manifest.
The most effective and perhaps
the only remedy for this
undesirable situation is the
students' appropriation of their
education by achieving a
significant measure of
self-determination of their
education in all its aspects.
Enlightened faculty would
welcome student self-determina
tion and true student
participation in the affairs of the
departments and the university,
for correlative of such
self-determination and such
participation would be increased
intellectual maturity and a
heightened sense of responsibility
for the success of the scholarly
enterprise and for their own
education.
Far from being an academic
jacquerie, such an assertion of
students' rights — for that is the
only authentic form this
attainment of self-determination
can take — would be a giant stride
toward making of university
students and faculty a real
community of scholars and
seekers of knowledge and
understanding.
'Granted' Rights
The assertion of one's right to
self-determination is the only
authentic way to gain this right
because the granting of a right —

in the true sense of the word
"grant" — is in reality an implicit
annulment of that right. For the
right to grant a right implies the
right to annul that right. Indeed,
in the course of history the
"granting" of rights has been,
with very few exceptions, the
recognition of a claim to those
rights.
But the individual graduate
student obviously has no hope of
successfully asserting a right to
self-determination. Only an
organization of students can do
this effectively. And, since so
many graduate students work as
research or teaching assistants,
and as such stand in a relationship
to the university of employee to
employer, the union is the type of
