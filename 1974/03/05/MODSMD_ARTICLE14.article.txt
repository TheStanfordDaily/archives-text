# ASSU History

I was most impressed by Chris
Murray's recent historical account
of today's "enfeebled" ASSU
administration, and I particularly
liked his glowing reflection of that
former ''powerful"
hero-president, Cesare Massarenti,
who was leader of the "classic 57
hours in May" which Dr. Lyman
"may never forget." It is amazing
that a person 13 years old at the
time would have so vivid a
memory.
Rather than nostalgically
longing for the days when we
could all be "right on" and pledge
our bodies to "seizing" the Old
Union, thus proving to the world
that we Stanford sophomores
knew far more about running this
University, yea the world, than
those presently in charge, I will
try to explain the transition
process in the ASSU from a more
fundamental level. There are
specific reasons for its present
form.
The problem with student
government is the fact that many,
if not most students, do not
necessarily want to be represented
or spoken for, particubrly by
someone like Cesare.
Self-Deception
With a 500 vote mandate (from
an electorate of approximately
12,000), the "president" thus
deceives only himself in
"representing" the student view.
Unfortunately, the people who
want to see the demise of the
ASSU cannot even get enough of
these disenfranchised people to
the polls to kill the thing, hence it
plods along representing only a
very small fraction of the students
and boring everyone else.
Even at that level, however, the
office takes enormous time and
jeopardizes the graduation
prospects of the current holder.
Ask Dennis Hayes about that.
The whole business boiled
down to this: one man
represented only one side of a
multi-opinioned student body, he
did nothing for the rest; if he was
disposed to carry his cross
publicly (as many were),
administration of, and help for,
the many student organizations
under ASSU was ignored; and
finally, he probably finished his
senior year with 45 units of
incomplete.
The way you want the
administration structured depends
upon what you want it to do. To
the extent that the council
method denies anyone of the
machismo of officially leading the
troops against the pigs
(administration, police, etc.), it
does provide for a lot of work to
be done in areas which would
otherwise be neglected. I found
these "other" areas generally to
be of far* more importance to
student organizations which had
programs beneficial to the entire
community than was otherwise
understood.
Division Of Duties
I was in the second such
Council, and of the four
individuals, one handled the
student Senate and the office
administration, one was
responsible for community
politics and land development
policies, one supervised student
efforts in educational reform,
handled tuition proposals and
educationally oriented projects as
well as the Academic Senate and
the fourth ran the Special Events
Program. I assure you there was
one hell of a lot of time and effort
expended in each of these areas,
though very little of it had enough
pizzazz to satisfy those who
longed for the days of Cesare.
The 1970-71 Council was also
labeled "weak" by Murray, but
in those areas where weakness was
criticized, the weakness was
planned. No seizures were led
because that council believed that
"negotiating" for the release of a
building like the Old Union was
the same type of extortion that
negotiating for the release of a
political prisoner is today.
The things that did happen
that year were not very glamorous
in themselves but these projects
and programs were beneficial to
those who needed them. There
was every bit as much dissension
within the group as I am sure
there is in this council, but we
tolerated our differences and most
often kept our sense of humor.
To what extent the present
Council is effective or
non-effective, I'm not sure.
Perhaps as Murray suggests
they should have taken a unified
position on the Row controversy.
There is comfort, however, to be
taken from the fact that at least
one of them is helping organize
and lead that issue. If I am not
mistaken, Cesare would not give a
damn if you blew up the Row
altogether.
