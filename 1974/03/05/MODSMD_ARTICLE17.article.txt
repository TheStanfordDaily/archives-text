# 'Will Rogers' U.S.A.'
## James Whitmore Recreates 'Poet Lariat' 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
I had the uncommon pleasure
of spending two hours with a
great man and spirit the other
evening. "Cowboy philosopher"
and folksy satirist, he slouched
around the stage, twirling his lasso
and offering witty words of
wisdom like a true "poet lariat."
He shared the latest news
(read: "jokes") from Washington,
quipped on the quirks of our
society, and shed some insightful
illumination on our human
foibles.
The occasion was James
Whitmore's recreation of the man
who never met a man he didn't
like, in Will Rogers' U.S.A., now
playing in a limited engagement at
A.C.T.'s Marines' Memorial
Theatre.
As coat and tie are discarded
for cowboy hat and rope, James
Whitmore ceases to be and the
legend of Will Rogers becomes
incarnate on stage. The script is
entirely Rogers, as is the mood.

He delivers one of his
spontaneous "lectures,"
deceptively like a stand-up
comedian's nightclub routine in
the abundance of laughter, but
too philosophically profound and
insightful to be classified in the
same genre as a Johnny Carson
monologue.
In his self-appointed and
universally acknowledged role of
observer-humorist of the
American scene he proceeds to
throw good-natured barbs at one
and all, but particularly the
politicians. All to soon it becomes
acutely apparent that little has
changed since the 1910s, '20s, and
'30s. His wry wit is just as relevant
as it is irreverent:
"We've got the best politicians
money can buy;" "Once a man
holds public office, he's
absolutely no good for honest
work;" "of course my little jokes
don't hurt nobody, but when
Congress makes a joke it's a law;"
"I'm not a member of any

organized party — I'm a
democrat."
The unceasing humor is
tempered with reflections of the
nature of our culture: "Half of
our life is spent trying to find
something to do with the time we
have rushed through life trying to
save." The script, adapted by Paul
Shyre, is a rich and varied
combination of moods, from
side-splitting wise crack to
poignant reminiscence.

As he thumbs through a
newspaper looking for his next
lines ("I don't make up my jokes.
I just read what happens in the
newspapers.") he seems
completely spontaneous. He uses
the audience as Rogers must
have, his timing impeccable, his
style relaxed and natural.
The audience is invited, indeed
compelled, to forget Whitmore
and see the man who is behind the
folk hero legend, a man who

radiates warmth in his jocular
digs, who provides therapy for a
world in which laughter is
necessary to survival.
In an age of faddish nostalgia
in which screen and stage are
cluttered with fond visions of the
past, Will Rogers' U.S.A. stands
far from the maudlin crowd. It is
a vivid recreation of history, to be
sure, but it is also relevant, rich,
and smashingly good
entertainment.

who never met a man he didn't
like, in Will Rogers' U.S.A., now
playing in a limited engagement at
A.C.T.'s Marines' Memorial
Theatre.
As coat and tie are discarded
for cowboy hat and rope, James
Whitmore ceases to be and the
legend of Will Rogers becomes
incarnate on stage. The script is
entirely Rogers, as is the mood.

He delivers one of his
spontaneous "lectures,"
deceptively like a stand-up
comedian's nightclub routine in
the abundance of laughter, but
too philosophically profound and
insightful to be classified in the
same genre as a Johnny Carson
monologue.
In his self-appointed and
universally acknowledged role of
observer-humorist of the
American scene he proceeds to
throw good-natured barbs at one
and all, but particularly the
politicians. All to soon it becomes
acutely apparent that little has
changed since the 1910s, '20s, and
'30s. His wry wit is just as relevant
as it is irreverent:
"We've got the best politicians
money can buy;" "Once a man
holds public office, he's
absolutely no good for honest
work;" "of course my little jokes
don't hurt nobody, but when
Congress makes a joke it's a law;"
"I'm not a member of any

organized party — I'm a
democrat."
The unceasing humor is
tempered with reflections of the
nature of our culture: "Half of
our life is spent trying to find
something to do with the time we
have rushed through life trying to
save." The script, adapted by Paul
Shyre, is a rich and varied
combination of moods, from
side-splitting wise crack to
poignant reminiscence.

As he thumbs through a
newspaper looking for his next
lines ("I don't make up my jokes.
I just read what happens in the
newspapers.") he seems
completely spontaneous. He uses
the audience as Rogers must
have, his timing impeccable, his
style relaxed and natural.
The audience is invited, indeed
compelled, to forget Whitmore
and see the man who is behind the
folk hero legend, a man who

radiates warmth in his jocular
digs, who provides therapy for a
world in which laughter is
necessary to survival.
In an age of faddish nostalgia
in which screen and stage are
cluttered with fond visions of the
past, Will Rogers' U.S.A. stands
far from the maudlin crowd. It is
a vivid recreation of history, to be
sure, but it is also relevant, rich,
and smashingly good
entertainment.


FOLKSY PHILOSOPHER—WiII Rogers is portrayed by actor James

I had the uncommon pleasure
of spending two hours with a
great man and spirit the other
evening. "Cowboy philosopher"
and folksy satirist, he slouched
around the stage, twirling his lasso
and offering witty words of
wisdom like a true "poet lariat."
He shared the latest news
(read: "jokes") from Washington,
quipped on the quirks of our
society, and shed some insightful
illumination on our human
foibles.
