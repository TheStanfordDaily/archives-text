# Pianist Seymour Bernstein Performs Uneven Concert
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Pianist Seymour Bernstein presented an unusual
and not entirely successful concert of masterpieces
and novelties to a tiny Dinkelspiel Auditorium
audience last Friday night.
The masterpieces: Beethoven's great C minor
Sonata, Opus 111, and Moussorgski's rich, effective
Pictures at an Exhibition.
Bernstein's own New Pictures at an Exhibition,
and three short pieces from his Books of Birds
might justifiably be called novelties, though they
proved attractive and technically successful
keyboard works.
Bernstein as piano-player is an unusual blend of
technical skills and occasional musical insensitivity.
A personable speaker who introduced most of the
evening's works through effective comments and
keyboard demonstrations, Bernstein is obviously
musically intelligent and interested.
Yet his performance of the Beethoven Sonata
was disappointing. Bernstein called the work
"profound" in his introductory comments, then
failed to plumb its depths in performance. The
opening "Allegro" was exaggeratedly forceful and
sentimental by turns, and the basic tempo a bit
slow in the bargain.

The celestial second movement is one of the
world's most difficult pieces of music, both to play
and comprehend. Bernstein's playing was flat and
frequently too loud, his tempo was stiff, and he
had difficulty with the infamous triple trills. Mr.
Bernstein might well listen with profit to a few
Schnabel recordings.
The pianist's own New Pictures at an Exhibition,
which concluded the program's first half, each
'describe' a famous painting; slides of the paintings
were shown and discussed by the composer before
the performance.
"I feel that the instrumentalist has an obligation
to try to create something all his own," Bernstein
told the audience â€” then demonstrated the
sincerity of his convictions.
Many of the New Pictures proved successful
miniatures, some pastiches of well-known musical
styles and tunes. "At the Moulin Rouge," for
example, quoted ragtime cliches, while "Mezzetin"
(after a painting by Watteau) sounded suspiciously
like Greensleeves.
A few of the pieces were pretentious
("Guernica," for instance), but most demonstrated
their author's neo-Romantic skills enjoyably.
