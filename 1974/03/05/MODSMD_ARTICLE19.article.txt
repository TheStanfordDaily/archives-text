# Pride Sparks 'Purlie' Cast

Productions like the Stanford

Art's Purlie are usually more
satisfying for those who make
them than for those who go to see
them. Occasionally the
satisfaction gets off the stage and
into the audience, making a
contribution to the spirit of the
entire community.
This is the case with John
Cochran's adaptation of the
Broadway musical Purlie
Victorious, now playing at the
Little Theater.
It is easy to see how much this
show means to the cast. Their
pleasure and pride in having put it
together is evident in the radiance
and animation of the faces in the
chorus, whose numbers are the
high spots of the show.
The stage fills with lovely
faces, attractive costumes and rich
melody. The opening number, in
which the chorus processes down
the side aisles humming and
singing a spiritual-like "hymn,"
actually sent chills down my neck.
The dancing is utterly free of
the usual corny artificiality of
most musical comedy. My only
regret is that there were not more
full chorus numbers.
Personal Liberation
Comedy is the transformation
of experience into laughter, and in
musical comedy the original
experience has usually been
transformed quite beyond
recognition. The "reality" out of
which this play comes is the Black
struggle for personal liberation in

the modern South.
We all know enough about that
struggle to know that most of it
isn't funny, but the point of the
play is to make us laugh, and so
the harder realities are suggested
only by a few allusions to civil
wrongs and a prop bull whip.
It's probably inappropriate to
read any kind of "message" into
the play, but one or two things
are especially interesting. For one,
the hero is a preacher; his goal is a
kind of spiritual, rather than
political or social, liberation. He
wants to buy an old church and
preach a gospel of
"here-and-now" religion.
The way to salvation,
according to the Rev. Purlie, is
through the Black power of
positive thinking. It's self esteem
the Black man needs, not a higher
standard of living and political
power.
Degenerate Landlord
Then again, it's interesting to
see how Purlie finally achieves his
victory over 01' Cap'n Cotchipee,
the degenerate landlord of
Cotchipee Plantation. It isn't
through violence, and it isn't
through non-violence. It's a virtual
deus ex machina, but the nature
of the machina makes a thought
provoking point.
Phil McGee as Purlie does a
fine job with an enormous role.
He has to do a lot of preaching
now and then, but though we've
ail heard the sermon before, it's a

good one and worth listening to
again.
Anne Kenney, as Lutiebelle
Gussie Mae Jenkins, tends to
overact her part with an excess of
enthusiasm, but the role is a hard
one and the way she handles it is
frequently effective.
Both Imani Rahu and John
McGee as Missy and Gitlow
Judson do outstanding jobs. Imani
Rahu's voice is the best in the
show, though I felt her one solo
number is not a song which makes
the most of her talent.
Rahu's duet with Purlie in
which she persuades him not to go
"up North" to find freedom
(which isn't there) but to stay
"Down Home" and help to make
it the way it ought to be is a very
fine number. John McGee as the
Uncle Tom Gitlow is very funny,
and has a good voice as well.
The most humorous song in
the play is "The Great White
Father of the Year," sung by the
trio of Purlie, Gitlo and one of the
cotton pickers. The Great White
Father, of course, is 01' Cap'n
Cotchipee, who is being flattered
by this song into releasing the
$500 inheritance Purlie needs to
buy his church.
The Cap'n, who finally gets
promoted to Colonel for doing
everybody the favor of dying, is

the one character whose portrayal
goes beyond stereotype and into
cartoon. It's difficult to do much
with such a part, but if Peter
Moore had looked less like
Colonel Sanders he could have
given the 01' Cap'n that touch of
humanity that Purlie glimpses in
his fantasy of confrontation with
the guilt ridden embodiment of
the conservative South.
The conservative South,
however, has given birth to a
liberal offspring, played by Chris
Hampton. Charlie Cotchipee is a
key role in the play, and it's a
glorious resolution when he
becomes the first White member
of Purlie's newly founded Big
Bethel Congregation.
Sylvia Cyson, as the Cap'n's
cook Odella, has a small role, but
she fills it well. In addition to
keeping the Cap'n in line, she also
serves as Charlie's music critic, as
he tries to find his way to that
magic rhythm that will ring the
liberty bell at Cotchipee Corners.
Purlie continues through
Saturday in the Little Theater.
Yes, the price is a little high —
$2.00 for students — but then so
are the vibes.
