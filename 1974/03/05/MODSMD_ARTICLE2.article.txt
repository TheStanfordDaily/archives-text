# Women's Day Fair Celebrates Feminism
## 
### WENDY QUINONES 
International Women's Day, March
8, is a holiday most Americans don't
know much about, since it's not
officially observed in this country.
But it will be celebrated at Stanford
this year with five days of lectures,
symposia, workshops, films, exhibits
and guerrilla theater, all concentrating
on women.
The International Women's Day
Fair, taking place on campus
tomorrow through Sunday, will
feature speakers such as Kate Millett,

author of Sexual Politics; Herbert
Marcuse, renowned Marxist
philosopher and author of
One-Dimensional Man; Jill Johnston,
author of Lesbian Nation; and Mary
Daly, Catholic theologian and author
of The Church and the Second Sex.
Workshops and symposia over the
five days will cover topics ranging
from legal rights, politics, career
opportunities, health care, male
feminism, Marxism and child care to
carpentry, car repair, yoga and
massage.

Highlights include: — talks by two
women political candidates, Cathy
O'Neill, running for Secretary of
State of California, and Maya Miller,
senatorial candidate in Nevada; — a
panel on women in the university with
Stanford affirmative action
administrators; — a panel on women in
the political process, with Marilyn
Patel, litigative counsel for NOW
(National Organization of Women),
and other politically active women —
and two panels on psychology
featuring local psychologists, staff
from the Transpersonal Therapy
Institute and Stanford counselors.
According to one of its organizers,
senior Liz Ditz, "The fair will be a
visible, accessible forum where people
can be exposed to the issues of
feminism, and a celebration of what
women are and have become."
Declared a holiday in 1910 by the
International Socialist Congress,
International Women's Day
commemorates a March 8,1908 strike
by New York women garment factory
workers.
Its observance in 1917 by women
workers in Petrograd, Russia, with a
strike in defiance of orders from
revolutionary leaders, started five days
of widespread strikes in Petrograd, and
the Russian Revolution was undersay.
Socialist Countries
Widely observed in socialist
countries for many years, the holiday's

recent celebrations in this country
date from 1969, when women at the
University of California in Berkeley
held a parade.
It was the first such public
observance in perhaps 20 years. Since
then, International Women's Day
activities have increased on college
campuses and in major cities all over
the United States.
Ditz and the fair's other
coordinators, Cary Ridder, Mykol
Hamilton, and ASSU Vice President
Beth Garfield, have been organizing
the fair since January with about 30
other women. Their biggest problems
have been publicity and funds, they
said.
"It was difficult to make definite
arrangements with Millett and
Johnston," Ridder explained. Without
those commitments, she continued,
publicity had to be held up, and
people were less willing to give money.
In spite of these difficulties, the
fair's organizers have amassed an
operating budget of more than $1100.
"Our money requirements were
high, because we wanted to pay
everyone," Ditz explained. "It was a
matter of principle. Women's labor is
too often unpaid and unappreciated."
Biggest Benefits
Unlike most campus women's
groups, whose reputation for
radicalism keeps participation low, the
fair has been able to attract women
