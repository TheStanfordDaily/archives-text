Meir Withdraws Resignation
JERUSALEM — Permier Golda Meir withdrew her
resignation yesterday and will try to form a new
government for Israel in the next two days, President
Ephraim Katzir announced.
Meir, who had announced Sunday she would not head
the next government, agreed to continue political
bargaining and try to form a government by a deadline set
for midnight Wednesday, Katzir said.
"Mrs. Meir informed me to my delight that she will carry
on her efforts," Katzir announced to newsmen just about
24 hours after the premier told her Labor alliance she
would not head the next government.
Labor party sources said earlier that Meir had agreed to
stay on as leader of Israel's next government after
colleagues pleaded with her to remain in power.
"I wish her success," Katzir said in a brief statement at
his presidential residence in Jerusalem.
Arabs To Resume Full Production?
WASHINGTON — The Arabs are expected to resume oil
production at pre-October levels when they lift their
embargo against the United States, probably in about a
week, authoritative sources said last night.
This assessment emerged as Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger returned from an eight-day trip to the Middle East
and Europe.
Prices are likely to drop to about $7 a barrel from the
current $11.65 and the supply will be plentiful, newsmen
were told.
Even $7 a barrel is considered to be somewhat high by
U.S. experts, but they are concerned that a lower price
could discourage development of alternative energy sources.
The price before October's Arab-Israel war was about
$3.01 a barrel. Production has been cut about 25 per cent.
Kissinger and others in his entourage are saying nothing
publicly about prospects for a lifting of the embargo and a
resumption of full production. But there is virtually no
doubt aboard his Air Force jet that the Arab oil ministers
will come through when they meet in Libya next Sunday.
Sirica To Hear Report Arguments
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica will
hold a hearing tomorrow to determine disposition of a
secret grand jury report said to deal with President Nixon's
role in Watergate.
The judge set the hearing for open court after a meeting
requested by James D. St. Clair, Nixon's lawyer in
Watergate—related matters.
"All interested counsel may state their views regarding
the disposition of the report and recommendation filed last
Friday by the 1972 grand jury," Sirica said after meeting
with St. Clair, assistant prosecutors and lawyers for H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman.
White House deputy press secretary Gerald L. Warren
confirmed St. Clair asked for Monday's meeting and added:
"Our position will be made known in open court. I have
nothing further to say at this time."

Earlier in the day Warren had said "there is no present
intention" on the part of the White House to ask that the
grand jury's report be withheld from the House
impeachment inquiry.
Asked whether the President's lawyers planned to make
any representations to Sirica, he said, "Not to my
knowledge."
After the Sirica meeting, Warren said he didn't know
that St. Clair planned to request it. "If he was," Warren
said, "he didn't tell me."
The judge's reference to the "recommendation" was the
first public confirmation that the grand jury had
accompanied its report with a suggestion of what should
become of it.
There had been published reports that the jury asked it
be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee.
'Mitchell Didn't Know Vesco'
NEW YORK — A lawyer for former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell told the jury at his client's criminal conspiracy trial
yesterday that Mitchell "didn't even know"the man who
supposedly bought his influence.
"There is not a single speck, a fragment, however you
describe it, of evidence you'll hear or could hear that John
Mitchell did anything to fix, to stop or to influence an
investigation of Robert Vesco," said Peter Fleming Jr. in a
45-minute statement before testimony began.
Mitchell and ex-Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans,
one-time stalwarts of President Nixon's re-election
campaign, are accused of accepting a secret $200,000
campaign contribution from international financier Robert
Vesco.
In return, the government charged, Mitchell and Stans
tried to impede a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation that eventually led to a $224 million civil suit,
charging Vesco with looting campanies he controlled at the
expense of stockholders.
Hayakawa Still Can't Run
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas refused on Monday to order S.I. Hayakawa's name
placed on California's ballot as a candidate for the
Republican senatorial nomination.
Douglas said that the federal issue, which would be
necessary to prompt his action, "has not yet surfaced in the
litigation ..
The former San Francisco State College president asked
Douglas to restrain state officials from refusing to accept
his nomination papers. The filing deadline is Friday.
Hayakawa's filing was refused because he has not been
registered as a Republican for 12 months.

Arabs To Resume Full Production?
WASHINGTON — The Arabs are expected to resume oil
production at pre-October levels when they lift their
embargo against the United States, probably in about a
week, authoritative sources said last night.
This assessment emerged as Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger returned from an eight-day trip to the Middle East
and Europe.
Prices are likely to drop to about $7 a barrel from the
current $11.65 and the supply will be plentiful, newsmen
were told.
Even $7 a barrel is considered to be somewhat high by
U.S. experts, but they are concerned that a lower price
could discourage development of alternative energy sources.
The price before October's Arab-Israel war was about
$3.01 a barrel. Production has been cut about 25 per cent.
Kissinger and others in his entourage are saying nothing
publicly about prospects for a lifting of the embargo and a
resumption of full production. But there is virtually no
doubt aboard his Air Force jet that the Arab oil ministers
will come through when they meet in Libya next Sunday.
Sirica To Hear Report Arguments
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica will
hold a hearing tomorrow to determine disposition of a
secret grand jury report said to deal with President Nixon's
role in Watergate.
The judge set the hearing for open court after a meeting
requested by James D. St. Clair, Nixon's lawyer in
Watergate—related matters.
"All interested counsel may state their views regarding
the disposition of the report and recommendation filed last
Friday by the 1972 grand jury," Sirica said after meeting
with St. Clair, assistant prosecutors and lawyers for H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman.
White House deputy press secretary Gerald L. Warren
confirmed St. Clair asked for Monday's meeting and added:
"Our position will be made known in open court. I have
nothing further to say at this time."

Earlier in the day Warren had said "there is no present
intention" on the part of the White House to ask that the
grand jury's report be withheld from the House
impeachment inquiry.
Asked whether the President's lawyers planned to make
any representations to Sirica, he said, "Not to my
knowledge."
After the Sirica meeting, Warren said he didn't know
that St. Clair planned to request it. "If he was," Warren
said, "he didn't tell me."
The judge's reference to the "recommendation" was the
first public confirmation that the grand jury had
accompanied its report with a suggestion of what should
become of it.
There had been published reports that the jury asked it
be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee.
'Mitchell Didn't Know Vesco'
NEW YORK — A lawyer for former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell told the jury at his client's criminal conspiracy trial
yesterday that Mitchell "didn't even know"the man who
supposedly bought his influence.
"There is not a single speck, a fragment, however you
describe it, of evidence you'll hear or could hear that John
Mitchell did anything to fix, to stop or to influence an
investigation of Robert Vesco," said Peter Fleming Jr. in a
45-minute statement before testimony began.
Mitchell and ex-Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans,
one-time stalwarts of President Nixon's re-election
campaign, are accused of accepting a secret $200,000
campaign contribution from international financier Robert
Vesco.
In return, the government charged, Mitchell and Stans
tried to impede a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation that eventually led to a $224 million civil suit,
charging Vesco with looting campanies he controlled at the
expense of stockholders.
Hayakawa Still Can't Run
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas refused on Monday to order S.I. Hayakawa's name
placed on California's ballot as a candidate for the
Republican senatorial nomination.

necessary to prompt his action, "has not yet surfaced in the
litigation ..
The former San Francisco State College president asked

the next government, agreed to continue political
bargaining and try to form a government by a deadline set

Even $7 a barrel is considered to be somewhat high by
U.S. experts, but they are concerned that a lower price
could discourage development of alternative energy sources.
The price before October's Arab-Israel war was about
$3.01 a barrel. Production has been cut about 25 per cent.
Kissinger and others in his entourage are saying nothing
publicly about prospects for a lifting of the embargo and a
resumption of full production. But there is virtually no
doubt aboard his Air Force jet that the Arab oil ministers
will come through when they meet in Libya next Sunday.
Sirica To Hear Report Arguments
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica will
hold a hearing tomorrow to determine disposition of a
secret grand jury report said to deal with President Nixon's
role in Watergate.
The judge set the hearing for open court after a meeting
requested by James D. St. Clair, Nixon's lawyer in
Watergate—related matters.
"All interested counsel may state their views regarding
the disposition of the report and recommendation filed last
Friday by the 1972 grand jury," Sirica said after meeting
with St. Clair, assistant prosecutors and lawyers for H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman.
White House deputy press secretary Gerald L. Warren
confirmed St. Clair asked for Monday's meeting and added:
"Our position will be made known in open court. I have
nothing further to say at this time."

Earlier in the day Warren had said "there is no present
intention" on the part of the White House to ask that the
grand jury's report be withheld from the House
impeachment inquiry.
Asked whether the President's lawyers planned to make
any representations to Sirica, he said, "Not to my
knowledge."
After the Sirica meeting, Warren said he didn't know
that St. Clair planned to request it. "If he was," Warren
said, "he didn't tell me."
The judge's reference to the "recommendation" was the
first public confirmation that the grand jury had
accompanied its report with a suggestion of what should
become of it.
There had been published reports that the jury asked it
be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee.
'Mitchell Didn't Know Vesco'
NEW YORK — A lawyer for former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell told the jury at his client's criminal conspiracy trial
yesterday that Mitchell "didn't even know"the man who
supposedly bought his influence.
"There is not a single speck, a fragment, however you
describe it, of evidence you'll hear or could hear that John
Mitchell did anything to fix, to stop or to influence an
investigation of Robert Vesco," said Peter Fleming Jr. in a
45-minute statement before testimony began.
Mitchell and ex-Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans,
one-time stalwarts of President Nixon's re-election
campaign, are accused of accepting a secret $200,000
campaign contribution from international financier Robert
Vesco.
In return, the government charged, Mitchell and Stans
tried to impede a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation that eventually led to a $224 million civil suit,
charging Vesco with looting campanies he controlled at the
expense of stockholders.
Hayakawa Still Can't Run
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas refused on Monday to order S.I. Hayakawa's name
placed on California's ballot as a candidate for the
Republican senatorial nomination.

necessary to prompt his action, "has not yet surfaced in the
litigation ..

his nomination papers. The filing deadline is Friday.

Meir Withdraws Resignation
JERUSALEM — Permier Golda Meir withdrew her
resignation yesterday and will try to form a new
government for Israel in the next two days, President
Ephraim Katzir announced.
Meir, who had announced Sunday she would not head
the next government, agreed to continue political
bargaining and try to form a government by a deadline set
for midnight Wednesday, Katzir said.
"Mrs. Meir informed me to my delight that she will carry
on her efforts," Katzir announced to newsmen just about
24 hours after the premier told her Labor alliance she
would not head the next government.
Labor party sources said earlier that Meir had agreed to
stay on as leader of Israel's next government after
colleagues pleaded with her to remain in power.
"I wish her success," Katzir said in a brief statement at
his presidential residence in Jerusalem.
Arabs To Resume Full Production?
WASHINGTON — The Arabs are expected to resume oil
production at pre-October levels when they lift their
embargo against the United States, probably in about a
week, authoritative sources said last night.
This assessment emerged as Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger returned from an eight-day trip to the Middle East
and Europe.
Prices are likely to drop to about $7 a barrel from the
current $11.65 and the supply will be plentiful, newsmen
were told.
Even $7 a barrel is considered to be somewhat high by
U.S. experts, but they are concerned that a lower price
could discourage development of alternative energy sources.
