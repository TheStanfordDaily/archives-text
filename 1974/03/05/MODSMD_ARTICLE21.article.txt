# Dorms To Stay Open During Spring Break
## 
### 
Students who intend to remain on
campus over spring break will be
permitted to stay in their campus
residences.
Dave Bell, assistant dean of student
affairs, said that the dorms,
fraternities, Row houses and
independent houses will officially be
closed in the sense that normal
custodial services will not be provided.
"The dorms will 'officially' be
closed, but students, who wish to, may
remain in their rooms. Services, such
as cleaning the lounges, will not be
provided," Bell stated.
The University still hopes to reduce
its heating oil consumption during the
break and minor heat shutdowns may
result, Bell said.
"The long-range weather forecast
says the end of March will be very
warm. If this warm weather fails to
materialize, we'll provide heat as
needed. We have no intention of

making the rooms unlivable," he
noted.
'Throughout the rest of the year,
we use our judgment as far as the
temperature goes, and well continue
to use our best judgment over the
spring break," he concluded.
Food services will close over the
break, as has been the practice in
previous years.
Student residences will officially
close at noon on Saturday, March 23,
and will re-open at noon on Sunday,
March 31. Many residence offices will
be closed throughout the break, with
others maintaining sporadic hours,
according to Bell.
