# Weekend Fire

### 
A small fire broke out in a
dormitory room at approximately 2
a.m. Sunday but was quickly
extinguished by the Stanford Fire
Department.
The fire occurred in the room of
senior Larry Diamond, former
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents who lives in Madera
House in Wilbur Hall, and was
apparently started by a candle
which ignited a foam floor cushion.
Firemen had to wear gas masks
because smoke from burning foam
is quite toxic. There was little
damage to the room or to
Diamond's belongings.
While firemen were responding
at Madera, three false alarms were
sounded at Stern Hall — two at
Zapata House and one at Burbank
House.
