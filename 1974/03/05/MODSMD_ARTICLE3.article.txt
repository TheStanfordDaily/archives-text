# Law School Graduate Granted New Trial
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A Phoenix judge granted a motion
for a new trial yesterday in the case of
Mick Goldstein, a 1973 Stanford Law
School graduate who was found guilty
by a federal jury in December of
harboring escaped federal prisoner
Ronald Wayne Beaty.
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E.
Craig granted the defense motion for a
new trial because he said, the jury
hadn't been told about the full
background of Beaty, the
government's leading witness.
Goldstein, along with Dr. Harry
Bishara and his wife Loraine, were
charged with hiding Beaty in Ft.
Defiance, Ariz., after Beaty escaped
from Chino State Prison in an ambush
in which a prison guard was killed.
Beaty pleaded guilty to the murder
in the case, and was sentenced to life
imprisonment. He appeared as the key
witness at the trial of Goldstein and
the Bisharas claiming that they had
harbored him. But the details regarding
his escape from Chino were kept from
the jury hearing the case.
Credibility Questioned
Craig explained that the jury's lack
of information about Beaty's
background may have affected its
ability to judge his credibility.
The judge added that he was
bothered by the government's failure
to better prove a connection between
the defendants and the militant Bay
Area group called Venceremos, which
has since claimed to have disbanded.
Goldstein was arrested while
working on a law externship on the
Navaho Indian Reservation in Ft.
Defiance, according to Chris Reif, a
special student at the Medical School
and member of the Chino Defense

Committee. The Committee formed to
aid people implicated in the escape of
Beaty from prison.
Re:f "laimcd that Goldstein and the
Bisharas had no idea that Beaty was an
escaped prisoner when he appeared at
the Bishara home in the autumn of
1972 asking for a place to stay for a
few days.
Contacted last night in Phoenix,
Goldstein stated that while he is
pleased with the judge's decision, his
apparent vindication does not
compensate for the trouble that he has
been forced to undergo since his arrest
16 months ago.
Jail
In addition to spending three days
in jail and posting $5000 bond for his
release, Goldstein said, the California
Bar held up his entry to the state legal
profession following his graduation
from law school last spring.
Goldstein, a resident of Los Altos,
has been working as a research
assistant in the Stanford Law School
since his graduation.
"The judge threw out the case
because of incompetent evidence,"
Goldstein stated in explaining the
reasons for Craig's decision. "All of
the evidence was based on what Beaty
said. Normally, hearsay evidence can't
be used against a person."
Goldstein said that he was
somewhat surprised by the judge's
decision.
"His legal grounds were strong,"
Goldstein explained. "But it is rare for
a judge to throw out of court the
decision of a jury, which is further
proof of the strength of our case."
Nevertheless, the prosecution may
request a new trial, Goldstein stated.

The judge added that he was
bothered by the government's failure
to better prove a connection between
the defendants and the militant Bay
Area group called Venceremos, which
has since claimed to have disbanded.
Goldstein was arrested while
working on a law externship on the
Navaho Indian Reservation in Ft.
Defiance, according to Chris Reif, a
special student at the Medical School
and member of the Chino Defense

Committee. The Committee formed to
aid people implicated in the escape of
Beaty from prison.
Re:f "laimcd that Goldstein and the
Bisharas had no idea that Beaty was an
escaped prisoner when he appeared at
the Bishara home in the autumn of
1972 asking for a place to stay for a
few days.
Contacted last night in Phoenix,
Goldstein stated that while he is
pleased with the judge's decision, his
apparent vindication does not
compensate for the trouble that he has
been forced to undergo since his arrest
16 months ago.
Jail
In addition to spending three days
in jail and posting $5000 bond for his
release, Goldstein said, the California
Bar held up his entry to the state legal
profession following his graduation
from law school last spring.
Goldstein, a resident of Los Altos,
has been working as a research
assistant in the Stanford Law School
since his graduation.
"The judge threw out the case
because of incompetent evidence,"
Goldstein stated in explaining the
reasons for Craig's decision. "All of
the evidence was based on what Beaty
said. Normally, hearsay evidence can't
be used against a person."
Goldstein said that he was
somewhat surprised by the judge's
decision.
"His legal grounds were strong,"
Goldstein explained. "But it is rare for
a judge to throw out of court the
decision of a jury, which is further
proof of the strength of our case."
Nevertheless, the prosecution may
request a new trial, Goldstein stated.
A Phoenix judge granted a motion
for a new trial yesterday in the case of
Mick Goldstein, a 1973 Stanford Law
School graduate who was found guilty
by a federal jury in December of
harboring escaped federal prisoner
Ronald Wayne Beaty.
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E.
Craig granted the defense motion for a
new trial because he said, the jury
hadn't been told about the full
background of Beaty, the
government's leading witness.
Goldstein, along with Dr. Harry
Bishara and his wife Loraine, were
charged with hiding Beaty in Ft.
Defiance, Ariz., after Beaty escaped
from Chino State Prison in an ambush
in which a prison guard was killed.
Beaty pleaded guilty to the murder
in the case, and was sentenced to life
imprisonment. He appeared as the key
witness at the trial of Goldstein and
the Bisharas claiming that they had
harbored him. But the details regarding
his escape from Chino were kept from
the jury hearing the case.
Credibility Questioned
Craig explained that the jury's lack
of information about Beaty's
background may have affected its
ability to judge his credibility.
