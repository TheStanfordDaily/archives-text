# Heath Bows Out; Wilson Appointed
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Conservative
Edward Heath resigned yesterday after
44 months as prime minister, and his
arch rival, Laborite Harold Wilson,
took over the task of trying to form a
new minority government.
A terse Buckingham Palace
statement announced Wilson's
appointment as prime minister. He
previously headed the British
government from 1964 until Heath's
Conservatives defeated Labor in the
1970 general elections.
The change of government became
effective from the moment Wilson
kissed Queen Elizabeth's hand in the
private audience room on the first
floor of the palace. His wife Mary
waited in a room nearby.

The Wilsons drove from the
audience directly to 10 Downing
Street, the residence of Britain's prime
ministers. Only two hours earlier
Heath had left to tender his
resignation to the queen.
"We've got a job to do," the
pipe-smoking Wilson told a crowd of
well-wishers. "We can only do that job
as one people. I'm going to do that job
now."
Moving
Moving men were taking Heath's
personal possessions out the back door
of the prime minister's residence. The
Wilsons planned to move in tomorrow.
Three days earlier, Wilson's
Laborites narrowly defeated the
Conservatives in national elections.
They took more seats in the House of
Commons than the Conservatives —
301 to 296 — but neither won enough
for a majority in the 635-seat House.
For three days Heath sought to
form a coalition government, but he
finally had to relinquish the
government when Jeremy Thorpe's
Liberals, with 14 seats, refused his
offer.
Third Victory
It was the third time Wilson led his
Laborites to victory in national
elections. He was elected leader of the
party in 1963, and one year later
Labor won a slender majority in the
House.
Wilson called new elections in 1966
and increased the margin to 100 seats,
but in 1970 he lost to Heath in what
was regarded as a major upset.
The top priority for Wilson's
government will be the coal miners'
strike menacing Britain's economy.
The reason Heath called elections in
the first place had been to win a
mandate to handle the strike, which
forced him to place the country on a
three-day work week.
Heath's Support
Heath pledged that "the new
government can be assured of my
support in whatever realistic measures
it takes in the interests of all the
people."
The next task before the new
government will be to seek massive
loans abroad to offset a trade deficit
running at an annual rate of $10
billion. Even before the election, the
British treasury said the government
would have to find more than $6.9
billion to cover the deficit and to meet
the higher costs of oil.
Party insiders said the Liberal
leaders made two major points at
yesterday's meeting. The first was that
joining a coalition with Heath would
do little to help Britain's troubles
because national divisions would
remain even if the Tories modified
some of their more controversial
policies.
Secondly, they felt that the
country's real need was a government

of national unity including both
Conservatives and Laborites in a grand
alliance, but neither Heath nor Wilson
showed the slightest interest in the
idea.
Also defecting from a potential
Tory coalition were 11 Northern
Ireland Protestants who campaigned
on a platform of unity with Britain. In
the past they functioned within the
Conservative party caucus, but they
backed out because Heath would not
give up his policy of conciliation with
Roman Catholics in Ulster.

British treasury said the government
would have to find more than $6.9
billion to cover the deficit and to meet
the higher costs of oil.
Party insiders said the Liberal
leaders made two major points at
yesterday's meeting. The first was that
joining a coalition with Heath would
do little to help Britain's troubles
because national divisions would
remain even if the Tories modified
some of their more controversial
policies.
Secondly, they felt that the
country's real need was a government

of national unity including both
Conservatives and Laborites in a grand
alliance, but neither Heath nor Wilson
showed the slightest interest in the
idea.
Also defecting from a potential
Tory coalition were 11 Northern
Ireland Protestants who campaigned
on a platform of unity with Britain. In
the past they functioned within the
Conservative party caucus, but they
backed out because Heath would not
give up his policy of conciliation with
Roman Catholics in Ulster.
LONDON (AP) — Conservative
Edward Heath resigned yesterday after
44 months as prime minister, and his
arch rival, Laborite Harold Wilson,
took over the task of trying to form a
new minority government.
A terse Buckingham Palace
statement announced Wilson's
appointment as prime minister. He
previously headed the British
government from 1964 until Heath's
Conservatives defeated Labor in the
1970 general elections.
The change of government became
effective from the moment Wilson
kissed Queen Elizabeth's hand in the
private audience room on the first
floor of the palace. His wife Mary
waited in a room nearby.

The Wilsons drove from the
audience directly to 10 Downing
Street, the residence of Britain's prime
ministers. Only two hours earlier
Heath had left to tender his
resignation to the queen.
"We've got a job to do," the
pipe-smoking Wilson told a crowd of
well-wishers. "We can only do that job
as one people. I'm going to do that job
now."
Moving
Moving men were taking Heath's
personal possessions out the back door
of the prime minister's residence. The
Wilsons planned to move in tomorrow.
Three days earlier, Wilson's
Laborites narrowly defeated the
Conservatives in national elections.
They took more seats in the House of
Commons than the Conservatives —
301 to 296 — but neither won enough
for a majority in the 635-seat House.
For three days Heath sought to
form a coalition government, but he
finally had to relinquish the
government when Jeremy Thorpe's
Liberals, with 14 seats, refused his
offer.
Third Victory
It was the third time Wilson led his
Laborites to victory in national
elections. He was elected leader of the
party in 1963, and one year later
Labor won a slender majority in the
House.
Wilson called new elections in 1966
and increased the margin to 100 seats,
but in 1970 he lost to Heath in what
was regarded as a major upset.
The top priority for Wilson's
government will be the coal miners'
strike menacing Britain's economy.
The reason Heath called elections in
the first place had been to win a
mandate to handle the strike, which
forced him to place the country on a
three-day work week.
Heath's Support
Heath pledged that "the new
government can be assured of my
support in whatever realistic measures
it takes in the interests of all the
people."
The next task before the new
government will be to seek massive
loans abroad to offset a trade deficit
running at an annual rate of $10
billion. Even before the election, the
British treasury said the government
would have to find more than $6.9
billion to cover the deficit and to meet
the higher costs of oil.
