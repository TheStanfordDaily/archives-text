# Palo Alto School Election
## Local Residents To Vote Today 
### 
Registered voters in Palo Alto and Stanford go to the
polls today to select a school board member. They will also
vote on a separate ballot issue that would add $1.5 million
to the 1974-75 school budget.
The five candidates running are Dr. Royce Cole, the
incumbent; Joshua Goldstein, a researcher at the Stanford
Institute for Political Studies; Paul Pease, an advertising
agency president; Alice Stratton, a psychiatric social
worker; and Claire Smith, a staff member at the Collective
community drug abuse project.
The ballot issue would override state-set ceilings on Palo
Alto's expenditure per ADA (Average Daily Attendence).
The ADA is a figure based on the theoretical number of
full-time students in a district, including summer school and
adult education. Under state Senate Bill 90, the ADA
determines the amount of aid poor districts get and the tax
ceilings wealthy districts like Palo Alto can raise to pay for
public education.
The override plan now being voted on would raise the
amount spent per ADA in Palo Alto from $1,642 in
1973-74 to $1,777 in 1974-75. If the override fails to pass,

then Palo Alto Unified School District would spend $1,672
per ADA.
The school board plan is to maintain the present
property tax of $5.97 per $100 assessed valuation. Without
the override, the tax would be reduced to $5.50 per $100
assessed valuation.
All of the candidates except Claire Smith have endorsed
the override.
According to the Registrar of Voter's Office, all eligible
5,542 voters on the Stanford campus have received sample
ballots by mail.
