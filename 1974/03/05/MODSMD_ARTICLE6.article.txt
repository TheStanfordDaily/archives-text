# KZSU's Campus Conference
## Lyman Won't Meet Research Aides' Reps 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
President Richard Lyman yesterday
declared that he does not plan to meet
with representatives of the Stanford
Union of Research Assistants (SURA),
an unofficial organization of graduate
students.
Speaking on a taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference, Lyman told
reporters that such a meeting might
imply official recognition of the union
and create problems with the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
"It is difficult to undertake free
discussion when a whole lot of
subjects are barred from us the minute
this unionization question comes into
play," Lyman commented. "That's
why I think it's so unfortunate that it
does come into play."
Lyman reaffirmed his wariness
about the unionization of graduate
students. He said that if they cease to
view themselves as students and start

seeing themselves as employees, this
would be a "great retrograde step."
Lyman denied charges that he
opposes unionization merely because
it would encourage an increase in
bureaucracy.
Bureaucratization
"I don't take bureaucratization as
synonymous with difficulty, or lack of
bureaucratization as synonymous with
ease," he said.
But he added that he would oppose
the creation of individual unions in
each of the individual departments
here.
Lyman reaffirmed that if the NLRB
approves the formation of a student
bargaining group, the University will
request that it be as centralized as
possible.
Poor Strategy
He remarked that formation of a
bargaining unit is a poor strategy for
graduate students to use in attempting
to increase their bargaining power.

"There have been occasions when
graduate students felt with
justification that they didn't have
enough of a hearing," Lyman said.
"But there are all sorts of ways of
doing this that have been used with
success in the academic history of this
and other universities."
Lyman said student goals might be
better accomplished without a union.
"The tradition in a university is to talk
things over freely," he explained.
"That tradition is handicapped when
you get into the unionization subject."
Annual Budget
Lyman also responded to questions
regarding the University's annual
budget, scheduled for release later this
week. Although he refused to discuss
details, he predicted that despite the
problem of inflation that is reflected
in the budget, he doubted if it would
"strike anyone as disastrous."
Lyman defended the University's
policy of not discussing the budget

until it is officially released in final
form. "It just isn't feasible to have the
entire community involved in the
technical process of producing that
budget," Lyman said.
'Far Too Ready'
"At the same time, I think people
are far too ready to throw in the towel
once it is published, far too ready to
forget that significant and
well-founded criticism of an existing
budget not only can, but will have an
impact on the budget of the
succeeding year."
Lyman emphasized that the budget
represents the best possible
accommodation of competing needs in
the University. He urged people to
study a 90-page report on the budget
that has been prepared by the
University to explain the budget in
considerable detail.
Campus Conference will be
broadcast at 7 p.m. today on KZSU.

bargaining group, the University will
request that it be as centralized as
possible.
Poor Strategy
He remarked that formation of a
bargaining unit is a poor strategy for
graduate students to use in attempting
to increase their bargaining power.

"There have been occasions when
graduate students felt with
justification that they didn't have
enough of a hearing," Lyman said.
"But there are all sorts of ways of
doing this that have been used with
success in the academic history of this
and other universities."
Lyman said student goals might be
better accomplished without a union.
"The tradition in a university is to talk
things over freely," he explained.
"That tradition is handicapped when
you get into the unionization subject."
Annual Budget
Lyman also responded to questions
regarding the University's annual
budget, scheduled for release later this
week. Although he refused to discuss
details, he predicted that despite the
problem of inflation that is reflected
in the budget, he doubted if it would
"strike anyone as disastrous."
Lyman defended the University's
policy of not discussing the budget

until it is officially released in final
form. "It just isn't feasible to have the
entire community involved in the
technical process of producing that
budget," Lyman said.
'Far Too Ready'
"At the same time, I think people
are far too ready to throw in the towel
once it is published, far too ready to
forget that significant and
well-founded criticism of an existing
budget not only can, but will have an
impact on the budget of the
succeeding year."
Lyman emphasized that the budget
represents the best possible
accommodation of competing needs in
the University. He urged people to
study a 90-page report on the budget
that has been prepared by the
University to explain the budget in
considerable detail.
Campus Conference will be
broadcast at 7 p.m. today on KZSU.

CAMPUS CONFERENCE—University President Richard Lyman, interviewed
last night on KZSU's Campus Conference, said he will not negotiate with the
unofficial graduate-level research assistants' union. The press conference will
be aired on KZSU at 7 p.m. tonight.
President Richard Lyman yesterday
declared that he does not plan to meet
with representatives of the Stanford
Union of Research Assistants (SURA),
an unofficial organization of graduate
students.
Speaking on a taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference, Lyman told
reporters that such a meeting might
imply official recognition of the union
and create problems with the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
"It is difficult to undertake free
discussion when a whole lot of
subjects are barred from us the minute
this unionization question comes into
play," Lyman commented. "That's
why I think it's so unfortunate that it
does come into play."
Lyman reaffirmed his wariness
about the unionization of graduate
students. He said that if they cease to
view themselves as students and start

seeing themselves as employees, this
would be a "great retrograde step."
Lyman denied charges that he
opposes unionization merely because
it would encourage an increase in
bureaucracy.
Bureaucratization
"I don't take bureaucratization as
synonymous with difficulty, or lack of
bureaucratization as synonymous with
ease," he said.
But he added that he would oppose
the creation of individual unions in
each of the individual departments
here.
Lyman reaffirmed that if the NLRB
approves the formation of a student
bargaining group, the University will
request that it be as centralized as
possible.
Poor Strategy
He remarked that formation of a
