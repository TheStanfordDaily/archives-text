## Kidnaping 
### 
In the one month since members of the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) allegedly kidnaped Patricia Hearst,
attention has been focused away from the crime itself and
toward the fulfillment of the kidnapers' demands.
Although some may argue that such public notice of the
social inequities of the People In Need program was designed
to counteract is healthy, no expression of social concern
should be allowed to soften our condemnation of the act of
kidnaping.
Forcible abduction is a felonious crime, whether
perpetrated by the SLA or by individuals such as Bruno
Richard Hauptmann, Richard Loeb or Nathan Leopold.
The Hearst incident presents an added danger in the
quasi-political status of the SLA. The possibility of other
groups who seek similar change in the current social order
resorting to likewise unacceptable acts is a grave prospect,
indeed. And before dismissing the likelihood of such an
occurence, we should remember that political terrorism of
this genre has become the order of the day in "democratic"
Argentina.
For these reasons, then, we refuse to look beyond the
initial act to weigh the merits of the SLA's alleged crime.
Condemnation of kidnaping cannot be mitigated by
circumstances. The act of abducting Patricia Hearst, or
anyone else, is inexcusable. Period.
