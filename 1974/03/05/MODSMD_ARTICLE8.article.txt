Russian House
Editor:
It was encouraging to read in
the Daily that a proposal to
establish a Russian Theme house
was under consideration by the
University. I wish to mention my
own profitable experience of
living in a foreign language house
at Macalester College in
Minnesota.
To its few thousand students
the college offered five
independent language houses.
These brought together students
interested in speaking and
studying Russian, French,
Spanish, Hebrew and German. I
am best acquainted with La
Maison Francaise, where I spent
three semesters.
Usually one or two native
French students or teaching
assistants resided in the house
with non-French students of
varied fluency in the language.
The house provided a good
environment for informal
conversation of day-to-day
matters or discussion of common
literature courses, for example, as
well as a center for occasional
gatherings with faculty or
community members.
A Russian house at Stanford
would provide not only a fine
opportunity for intensive and
continuous study of the language,
but also a possible center for
worthwhile interaction with the
sizeable Russian population of
both San Francisco and the
immediate community. I think
the proposal for such a residence
is one worthy of support by
Stanford's students.

It was with a great deal of
shock and disappointment that I
read the article dealing with W.
Glenn Campbell's invitation to
Alexander Solzhenitsyn to study
at the Hoover Institution.
Am I to believe this is the same
W. Glenn Campbell who, as member
of the University of California
Board of Regents, was one of the
most outspoken critics of Angela
Davis, and who did everything
within his power to deny her not
only her freedom of speech but
also her right to earn a living in
her chosen profession?
This action appears to me a
most blatant example of Dr.
Campbell's double standard — one
attitude toward outspoken
dissident black Americans, and
another special one for outspoken
dissident Soviets.
So as not to appear
narrow-minded, perhaps Dr.

Campbell might attempt to alter
his image somewhat by sending a
similar invitation to Angela.

Throughout the history of
mankind, ignorant people were
manipulated by political leaders
and the governments they
directed. The aim of a liberal arts
institution is to rid its students of
traditional ignorance and show
the methods intelligent people use
to control their lives.
Stanford is such an institution.
However, an alarming number of
students are proudly declaring
themselves to be "red-hot'' and
"pre-med." While it is true a
certain number of such students
are probably needed for
diversification, the pendulum has
swung too far. Their increasing
numbers are destroying the
character of the remaining
students.
Even President Lyman has
been forced to defend the role of
a liberal arts education. While
others try to understand the
world and enjoy themselves, these
students clamor for power,
prestige, and money. They fail to
see science in its true context.
Actually, it is relatively
unimportant. Why else are
scientific developments relegated
to the back pages of newspapers,
while political events are on the
front page?
Pre-meds profess they are
humanitarians trying to save
mankind from the scourge of
disease. Noble as this devotion
may be, it is only a small part of
the tremendous problems facing
our world today. Their role
increasingly will be that of a
technician, with little original
thought involved in their
assignments. If the intention of
the pre-med is to save the world,
he or she is in the wrong field.
What do you pay $5000 a year
for? For that price you should at
least be allowed to think. And any
thoughtful person will see the
folly of those who restrict their
energy to one limited facet of
education.
We sit in one of the great
liberal universities of our nation.
So let's be liberal. We are
supposed to get a liberal arts
education here. Remember,
change is the constant state of the
world. Organic chemistry cannot
repress it. Don't bury yourself in
technology. Others will use your
advancements to serve their own
purposes, as history has shown
only too painfully. Technology
and science have their proper
places in society; keep them there.

establish a Russian Theme house
was under consideration by the
University. I wish to mention my
own profitable experience of
living in a foreign language house
at Macalester College in
Minnesota.
To its few thousand students
the college offered five
independent language houses.
These brought together students
interested in speaking and
studying Russian, French,
Spanish, Hebrew and German. I
am best acquainted with La
Maison Francaise, where I spent
three semesters.
Usually one or two native
French students or teaching
assistants resided in the house
with non-French students of
varied fluency in the language.
The house provided a good
environment for informal
conversation of day-to-day
matters or discussion of common
literature courses, for example, as
well as a center for occasional
gatherings with faculty or
community members.
A Russian house at Stanford
would provide not only a fine
opportunity for intensive and
continuous study of the language,
but also a possible center for
worthwhile interaction with the
sizeable Russian population of
both San Francisco and the
immediate community. I think
the proposal for such a residence
is one worthy of support by
Stanford's students.

It was with a great deal of
shock and disappointment that I
read the article dealing with W.
Glenn Campbell's invitation to
Alexander Solzhenitsyn to study
at the Hoover Institution.
Am I to believe this is the same
W. Glenn Campbell who, as member
of the University of California
Board of Regents, was one of the
most outspoken critics of Angela
Davis, and who did everything
within his power to deny her not
only her freedom of speech but
also her right to earn a living in
her chosen profession?
This action appears to me a
most blatant example of Dr.
Campbell's double standard — one
attitude toward outspoken
dissident black Americans, and
another special one for outspoken
dissident Soviets.
So as not to appear
narrow-minded, perhaps Dr.

Campbell might attempt to alter
his image somewhat by sending a
similar invitation to Angela.

Throughout the history of
mankind, ignorant people were
manipulated by political leaders
and the governments they
directed. The aim of a liberal arts
institution is to rid its students of
traditional ignorance and show
the methods intelligent people use
to control their lives.
Stanford is such an institution.
However, an alarming number of
students are proudly declaring
themselves to be "red-hot'' and
"pre-med." While it is true a
certain number of such students
are probably needed for
diversification, the pendulum has
swung too far. Their increasing
numbers are destroying the
character of the remaining
students.
Even President Lyman has
been forced to defend the role of
a liberal arts education. While
others try to understand the
world and enjoy themselves, these
students clamor for power,
prestige, and money. They fail to
see science in its true context.
Actually, it is relatively
unimportant. Why else are
scientific developments relegated
to the back pages of newspapers,
while political events are on the
front page?
Pre-meds profess they are
humanitarians trying to save
mankind from the scourge of
disease. Noble as this devotion
may be, it is only a small part of
the tremendous problems facing
our world today. Their role
increasingly will be that of a
technician, with little original
thought involved in their
assignments. If the intention of
the pre-med is to save the world,
he or she is in the wrong field.
What do you pay $5000 a year
for? For that price you should at
least be allowed to think. And any
thoughtful person will see the
folly of those who restrict their
energy to one limited facet of
education.
We sit in one of the great
liberal universities of our nation.
So let's be liberal. We are
supposed to get a liberal arts
education here. Remember,
change is the constant state of the
world. Organic chemistry cannot
repress it. Don't bury yourself in
technology. Others will use your
advancements to serve their own
purposes, as history has shown
only too painfully. Technology
and science have their proper
places in society; keep them there.
