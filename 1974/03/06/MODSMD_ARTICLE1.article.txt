# Group Seeks Rent Board Initiative
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Fair Rent Committee, a Palo
Alto tenant's group, asserts it has
collected enough valid signatures to
place an initiative calling for the
establishment of a Rent Control Board
on the June primary ballot.
"There is a real housing crisis in
Palo Alto," Brad Dowden, a
coordinator of the Fair Rent
Committee stated. "There is a low
vacancy rate, and landlords rent to the
people who can pay them the most
money."
The Rent Control Board, comprised
of five members elected to four-year
terms, would give tenants the power to
set fair rents, Dowden stated. He could
appeal excessive rent to the Board,
which could fine a landlord up to
$2000.
Evictions - Major Problem
Dowden noted the Board would
have no power to deal with evictions.
"Evictions are a major problem in
Palo Alto," Dowden said. "But we
were afraid that the inclusion of
provisions for evictions would slow the
establishment of the Board. We can
foliowup on evictions later."
Except for the omission of an
eviction provision the proposed Palo
Alto board is modeled after one in
Berkeley.
Landlords
The purpose of the Board is not to
force landlords out of business,
Dowden emphasized.
"The Board would not attempt to
be unfair to landlords," Dowden said.
"Landlords deserve a fair return on
their investment in property. But too
many of them gouge their tenants by
raising rents to a maximum."
The Fair Rent Committee is
composed of members of the Palo
Alto Tenants' Union and concerned
individuals.
High Rents
The Board would not hear
complaints from tenants living in
government subsidized housing, but
Dowden claimed the Board would be
of service to University students and
staff members.
At the present time, many
University people are charged
prohibitive rents, and some are forced
to live as far away as Fremont because
they are unable to find adequate
low-cost housing in Palo Alto, Dowden
charged.
Housing Shortage
The Palo Alto housing shortage
resulted from the construction of the
Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950's
and the University's general expansion,
Dowden said.
Although Dowden guessed that
City Council members will oppose the
proposed rent control Board, he
predicted that the voters will approve
it at the election in June.
"Forty-eight percent of the
residents of Palo Alto are tenants,"
Dowden said. "The creation of the
board is in their best interests."
The initiative petition bearing
6,043 signatures was presented to the
City Clerk's office yesterday
afternoon.
Kathleen Simkins, assistant city
clerk, explained that in order for the
measure to make the June ballot, a
total of 3,497 valid signatures — or 15
percent of the votes cast in the city in
the last gubernatorial race — must be
filed.

on the June primary ballot.
"There is a real housing crisis in
Palo Alto," Brad Dowden, a
coordinator of the Fair Rent
Committee stated. "There is a low
vacancy rate, and landlords rent to the
people who can pay them the most
money."
The Rent Control Board, comprised
of five members elected to four-year
terms, would give tenants the power to
set fair rents, Dowden stated. He could
appeal excessive rent to the Board,
which could fine a landlord up to
$2000.
Evictions - Major Problem
Dowden noted the Board would
have no power to deal with evictions.
"Evictions are a major problem in
Palo Alto," Dowden said. "But we
were afraid that the inclusion of
provisions for evictions would slow the
establishment of the Board. We can
foliowup on evictions later."
Except for the omission of an
eviction provision the proposed Palo
Alto board is modeled after one in
Berkeley.
Landlords
The purpose of the Board is not to
force landlords out of business,
Dowden emphasized.
"The Board would not attempt to
be unfair to landlords," Dowden said.
"Landlords deserve a fair return on
their investment in property. But too
many of them gouge their tenants by
raising rents to a maximum."
The Fair Rent Committee is
composed of members of the Palo
Alto Tenants' Union and concerned
individuals.
High Rents
The Board would not hear
complaints from tenants living in
government subsidized housing, but
Dowden claimed the Board would be
of service to University students and
staff members.
At the present time, many
University people are charged
prohibitive rents, and some are forced
to live as far away as Fremont because
they are unable to find adequate
low-cost housing in Palo Alto, Dowden
charged.
Housing Shortage
The Palo Alto housing shortage
resulted from the construction of the
Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950's
and the University's general expansion,
Dowden said.
Although Dowden guessed that
City Council members will oppose the
proposed rent control Board, he
predicted that the voters will approve
it at the election in June.
"Forty-eight percent of the
residents of Palo Alto are tenants,"
Dowden said. "The creation of the
board is in their best interests."
The initiative petition bearing
6,043 signatures was presented to the
City Clerk's office yesterday
afternoon.
Kathleen Simkins, assistant city
clerk, explained that in order for the
measure to make the June ballot, a
total of 3,497 valid signatures — or 15
percent of the votes cast in the city in
the last gubernatorial race — must be
filed.

CANCER PATIENT — Josephine Bergman, a terminal cancer patient in Stanford
Hospital, is seeking a court order which would force the hospital to continue her
treatment with Laetrile, a controversial drug. Laetrile, also known as Vitamin
817, is illegal for use in treating cancer in California.
The Fair Rent Committee, a Palo
Alto tenant's group, asserts it has
collected enough valid signatures to
place an initiative calling for the
establishment of a Rent Control Board
on the June primary ballot.
