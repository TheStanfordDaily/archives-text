# Arms Control And Realistic Goals

In his column "Nuclear Strategy Schools
*Vrong" (Daily, Feb. 28), Bill Evers commits
some fundamental errors of fact, and despite
his noble intentions (complete multilateral
disarmament down to police levels) he
distorts and confuses an already complex
problem.
While it is true that the two American
nuclear schools of thought contain some
contradictions and ambiguities, it is an
exaggeration to label them as "rival schools,"
as they basically complement each other. The
school of assured destruction states that we
will deliver an unacceptable amount of
destruction to an aggressor if we are
sufficiently provoked (i.e. a massive nuclear
attack on the U.S. or our allies).
It is under this strategy that we maintain a
capability to destroy enemy cities and
industry even after absorbing a first strike.
Inasmuch as potential aggressors are aware of
this capability, we assume they will not
launch a massive first strike; it would mean
the end of their society as well.
This deterrence is mutual since the U.S.
knows if it launches a total nuclear attack it
would also face destruction. The SALT
agreements upheld this concept of assured
destruction by preventing both the U.S. and
the Soviet Union from establishing elaborate
defenses of their populations.
Counterforce School
The second school, that of counterforce,
believes that weapons would be aimed at
opposing weapons so in event of a limited
nuclear war more options would present

themselves than simply the total destruction
of both societies. A scenario can be
envisioned whereby the Soviets, in order to
force the U.S. to take a certain position or to
back down on a non essential interest, would
destroy a U.S. submarine base.
With a counterforce capability the U.S.
would have the option of destroying a similar
target in the Soviet Union, and would not be
faced with the choice of either not
responding at all, or destroying a Soviet city
and bringing retaliation on our own cities. It
is hoped that in a limited exchange of nuclear
weapons some sort of accommodation would
be reached before total nuclear war would
break out.
Basically then, the assured destruction
school protects essential interests and the
counterforce school protects limited
interests. It is clear that the situation that
now exists is unstable and may even be (as
Evers writes) "immoral and impractical" but
it must be understood that these schools are
merely reflecting the existing situation. In
order to better the situation, we must work
through these schools.
Disarmament Wonderful
Total and complete disarmament (as put
forth by Evers) would be a wonderful event,
but it is so far-fetched that to work directly
towards it becomes counterproductive. The
main problem hinges on verification. If in the
"world of the blind the one eyed man is
king" than in the land of conventional
weapons the nuclear power is king. Despite

what Evers writes, the Soviet Union has
consistently been against on-site inspection
and when they recently agreed to the idea of
some on-site inspection, it was at a level far
below what the U.S. would want.
The Soviet Union, being a relatively
controlled and closed society, has much more
to lose from on-site inspection than does the
U.S. Furthermore, even with large scale on
site inspection and satellite coverage the
problems of safely verifying that the other
side has absolutely no nuclear weapons are
virtually insurmountable. This is all the more
so with the growth of peaceful nuclear
energy.
Problem Not Limited
Finally, the problem is not limited to the
U.S. and the Soviet Union (who between
themselves find it extremely difficult to agree
on minor arms control steps). China, Britain
and France all possess nuclear weapons and a
half a dozen other countries are capable of
producing them. The amount of trust and
capatibility of intÂ»~e?t c of these states that
would be required for them all to disarm
simply is not forthcoming in the forseeable
future.
No one suggests that the present nuclear
situation is a good one or even the best under
the circumstances. Much progress on mutual
force reductions needs to be accomplished
but it can only proceed if it is carried out in a
realistic atmosphere with realistic goals.
