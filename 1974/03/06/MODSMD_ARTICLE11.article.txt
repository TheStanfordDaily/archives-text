Geology Wakeful
Editor:
I wish to make a public
apology to the Department of
Geology and the staff thereof. On
Feb. 7, the Daily quoted an
unfortunate statement that I had
made the night before in the.
"Progress in Medicine" lecture
series, in reference to sleepiness
and boredom; to wit, that the
study of geology is likely to make
one sleepy.
This was, on my part, an
unfortunate slip of the tongue. At
the moment of the statement, I
was actually trying to decide
which of two courses in my own
undergraduate experience was the
least exciting, a course on
geocarpology or one on
biotopology (the latter would be
quite interesting today, but 25
years ago, it was somewhat
lacking in form) and what Freud
called "condensation"
unfortunately took place,
resulting in neologistic utterance
"geology."
With regard to the fascinating
discipline of geology, I am one of
its most fervent admirers. From
my early days when I
accompanied my grandfather on
prospecting trips into the Hell's
Canyon area, my jolly college
field trips by the Columbia Basin
Badlands, up until my present
intense interest in the energy crisis
and mideastern oil crisis, I have
had nothing but the utmost
wakefulness provided by the
problems of the earth's crust.
Indeed, were it not for the fact
that my grandfather lost his shirt
when he bought the infamous
Cornucopia Mine after the vein
had petered out, thereby
establishing a lifelong family
bitterness against things mineral, I
would probably be a geologist
myself. Quite frankly, the thing
that puts me to sleep most

quickly is my own research!

Critique
Editor:
When a person reads a
newspaper review of a theatrical
production, he expects just that —
a critique of the actors'
performances and of directing
methods and technical aspects of
the production, not a lecture on
the meaning of the play. Any of
Stanford's highly literate students
can attempt an analysis of a play's
substance, but few can write a
decent review. Jennifer Randisi's
"review" of the Toyon
presentation of J.B. (Daily, Feb.
26) provided a term paper analysis
of Archibald MacLeish's play, and
an incorrect one at that.
Directed by Gioia (not Gloria)
Kelley, J.B. has much more to say
than Randisi indicated. Zuss and
Nickles only portray God and
satan. They have no real control
over J.B. All they can do is repeat
lines from the Book of Job,
comment, and watch what occurs.
In the Prologue, Zuss notes that
"there's always someone playing
Job," and later Nickles responds,
saying "Job is everywhere ...
questioning everything."
Just as Zuss and Nickles do not
control J. 8., the "offstage
prompter" (called the "Distant
Voice" by MacLeish) doesn't
control them. The Voice
disciplines them; He (the capital H
is significant) in effect tells them
not to mess around with things
they can't handle.
Part of J.B.'s epiphany at the
end of the play involves his own
words of the first scene: "Nobody
deserves it, not the world that
God has given us. .. . It's given to
us, gift on gift." J.B. puts himself
above the Giver, demanding
reasons for the revocation of
those gifts for which no promise
of permanence was ever made.
(Recall that satan took those gifts

from him, God didn't.)
After the Distant Voice shows
J.B. that fault, he "abhors
himself," asking forgiveness of a
just God, not forgiving Him. J.B.
triumphs in the end, but he does
not triumph over God. The
enormity of his faith plus his
experience of God's power and
glory are victories over Zuss, who
expected J.B. to grovel before
him.
J.B.'s desire to rebuild his
broken life is also a triumph over
both Nickles and satan. All it
takes to silence Nickles are J.B.'s
movements toward the door
behind which his returning wife
stands. "Do you hear? .. . There
is someone waiting at the door,"
says J.B. Nickles' only response is
"I know."
While a synopsis of a play's
action is necessary for a good
review, a discussion of its meaning
is not. Perhaps in the future, the
Daily's reviewers can concentrate
more on the productions instead
of on writing a C+ term paper.

Simple Plan
Editor: «
Chuck Moine's article in the
Daily, Feb. 27, offered a
reasonable suggestion, but it
didn't go far enough. To correct
this, I propose the following
simple three step plan:
1) Procure a loaded pistol;
2) Place the muzzle against
your temple;
3) Pull the trigger.
Execution of this plan should
ensure an immediate encounter
with Christ.

'Miserable Coaching'
Editor:
The reason for the Stanford
basketball team's wretched season
is not a lack of "vocal support"
from their fans as Ron Saritzky
contends (Daily, Feb. 28).
Nor is it — as the coaches
would have us believe week after
week — the refereeing to which
the team has been subjected.
(Admittedly, we have witnessed
some horrendous officiating this
season — but all teams have
suffered the same handicap.)
The most obvious assumption
from the team's dismal record —
that the team lacks talent — is
erroneous as well. (What other
NCAA team has a seven-foot
center who leads the fast-break or
a 12-year-old forward who shoots
better than 55 percent from the
floor?)
The problem is simply
miserable coaching. Like Saritzky,
Howie Dailmar has "spent too
many Friday nights sitting
around."
Until Dailmar and his
administration resign for the good
of the University, or Joe Ruetz
and the Athletic Department face
up to their responsibilities and
initiate impeachment proceedings
against these culprits, there will be
precious little to yell and cheer
about at Maples — this season or
any other.

Chuck Moine's article in the
Daily, Feb. 27, offered a
reasonable suggestion, but it
didn't go far enough. To correct
this, I propose the following
simple three step plan:
1) Procure a loaded pistol;
2) Place the muzzle against
your temple;
3) Pull the trigger.
Execution of this plan should
ensure an immediate encounter

'Miserable Coaching'
Editor:
The reason for the Stanford
basketball team's wretched season
is not a lack of "vocal support"
from their fans as Ron Saritzky
contends (Daily, Feb. 28).
Nor is it — as the coaches
would have us believe week after
week — the refereeing to which
the team has been subjected.
(Admittedly, we have witnessed
some horrendous officiating this
season — but all teams have
suffered the same handicap.)
The most obvious assumption
from the team's dismal record —
that the team lacks talent — is
erroneous as well. (What other
NCAA team has a seven-foot
center who leads the fast-break or
a 12-year-old forward who shoots
better than 55 percent from the
floor?)
The problem is simply
miserable coaching. Like Saritzky,
Howie Dailmar has "spent too
many Friday nights sitting
around."
Until Dailmar and his
administration resign for the good
of the University, or Joe Ruetz
and the Athletic Department face
up to their responsibilities and
initiate impeachment proceedings
against these culprits, there will be
precious little to yell and cheer
about at Maples — this season or
any other.

Geology Wakeful
Editor:
I wish to make a public
apology to the Department of
Geology and the staff thereof. On
Feb. 7, the Daily quoted an
unfortunate statement that I had
made the night before in the.
"Progress in Medicine" lecture
series, in reference to sleepiness
and boredom; to wit, that the
study of geology is likely to make
one sleepy.
This was, on my part, an
unfortunate slip of the tongue. At
the moment of the statement, I
was actually trying to decide
which of two courses in my own
undergraduate experience was the
least exciting, a course on
geocarpology or one on
biotopology (the latter would be
quite interesting today, but 25
years ago, it was somewhat
lacking in form) and what Freud
called "condensation"
unfortunately took place,
resulting in neologistic utterance
"geology."
With regard to the fascinating
discipline of geology, I am one of
its most fervent admirers. From
my early days when I
accompanied my grandfather on
prospecting trips into the Hell's
Canyon area, my jolly college
field trips by the Columbia Basin
Badlands, up until my present
intense interest in the energy crisis
and mideastern oil crisis, I have
had nothing but the utmost
wakefulness provided by the
problems of the earth's crust.
Indeed, were it not for the fact
that my grandfather lost his shirt
when he bought the infamous
Cornucopia Mine after the vein
had petered out, thereby
establishing a lifelong family
bitterness against things mineral, I
would probably be a geologist
myself. Quite frankly, the thing
that puts me to sleep most

quickly is my own research!

Critique
Editor:
When a person reads a
newspaper review of a theatrical
production, he expects just that —
a critique of the actors'
performances and of directing
methods and technical aspects of
the production, not a lecture on
the meaning of the play. Any of
Stanford's highly literate students
can attempt an analysis of a play's
substance, but few can write a
decent review. Jennifer Randisi's
"review" of the Toyon
presentation of J.B. (Daily, Feb.
26) provided a term paper analysis
of Archibald MacLeish's play, and
an incorrect one at that.
Directed by Gioia (not Gloria)
Kelley, J.B. has much more to say
than Randisi indicated. Zuss and
Nickles only portray God and
satan. They have no real control
over J.B. All they can do is repeat
lines from the Book of Job,
comment, and watch what occurs.
In the Prologue, Zuss notes that
"there's always someone playing
Job," and later Nickles responds,
saying "Job is everywhere ...
questioning everything."
Just as Zuss and Nickles do not
control J. 8., the "offstage
prompter" (called the "Distant
Voice" by MacLeish) doesn't
control them. The Voice
disciplines them; He (the capital H
is significant) in effect tells them
not to mess around with things
they can't handle.
Part of J.B.'s epiphany at the
end of the play involves his own
words of the first scene: "Nobody
deserves it, not the world that
God has given us. .. . It's given to
us, gift on gift." J.B. puts himself
above the Giver, demanding
reasons for the revocation of
those gifts for which no promise
of permanence was ever made.
(Recall that satan took those gifts

from him, God didn't.)
After the Distant Voice shows
J.B. that fault, he "abhors
himself," asking forgiveness of a
just God, not forgiving Him. J.B.
triumphs in the end, but he does
not triumph over God. The
enormity of his faith plus his
experience of God's power and
glory are victories over Zuss, who
expected J.B. to grovel before
him.
J.B.'s desire to rebuild his
broken life is also a triumph over
both Nickles and satan. All it
takes to silence Nickles are J.B.'s
movements toward the door
behind which his returning wife
stands. "Do you hear? .. . There
is someone waiting at the door,"
says J.B. Nickles' only response is
"I know."
While a synopsis of a play's
action is necessary for a good
review, a discussion of its meaning
is not. Perhaps in the future, the
Daily's reviewers can concentrate
more on the productions instead
of on writing a C+ term paper.

In the Prologue, Zuss notes that
"there's always someone playing
Job," and later Nickles responds,
saying "Job is everywhere ...
questioning everything."
Just as Zuss and Nickles do not
control J. 8., the "offstage
prompter" (called the "Distant
Voice" by MacLeish) doesn't
control them. The Voice
disciplines them; He (the capital H
is significant) in effect tells them
not to mess around with things
they can't handle.
Part of J.B.'s epiphany at the
end of the play involves his own
words of the first scene: "Nobody
deserves it, not the world that
God has given us. .. . It's given to
us, gift on gift." J.B. puts himself
above the Giver, demanding
reasons for the revocation of
those gifts for which no promise
of permanence was ever made.
(Recall that satan took those gifts

from him, God didn't.)
After the Distant Voice shows
J.B. that fault, he "abhors
himself," asking forgiveness of a
just God, not forgiving Him. J.B.
triumphs in the end, but he does
not triumph over God. The
enormity of his faith plus his
experience of God's power and
glory are victories over Zuss, who
expected J.B. to grovel before
him.
J.B.'s desire to rebuild his
broken life is also a triumph over
both Nickles and satan. All it
takes to silence Nickles are J.B.'s
movements toward the door
behind which his returning wife
stands. "Do you hear? .. . There
is someone waiting at the door,"
says J.B. Nickles' only response is
"I know."
While a synopsis of a play's
action is necessary for a good
review, a discussion of its meaning
is not. Perhaps in the future, the
Daily's reviewers can concentrate
more on the productions instead
of on writing a C+ term paper.

Simple Plan
Editor: «
Chuck Moine's article in the
Daily, Feb. 27, offered a
reasonable suggestion, but it
didn't go far enough. To correct
this, I propose the following
simple three step plan:
1) Procure a loaded pistol;
2) Place the muzzle against
your temple;
3) Pull the trigger.
Execution of this plan should
ensure an immediate encounter

'Miserable Coaching'
Editor:
The reason for the Stanford
basketball team's wretched season
is not a lack of "vocal support"
from their fans as Ron Saritzky
contends (Daily, Feb. 28).
Nor is it — as the coaches
would have us believe week after
week — the refereeing to which
the team has been subjected.
(Admittedly, we have witnessed
some horrendous officiating this
season — but all teams have
suffered the same handicap.)
The most obvious assumption
from the team's dismal record —
that the team lacks talent — is
erroneous as well. (What other
NCAA team has a seven-foot
center who leads the fast-break or
a 12-year-old forward who shoots
better than 55 percent from the
floor?)
The problem is simply
miserable coaching. Like Saritzky,
Howie Dailmar has "spent too
many Friday nights sitting
around."
Until Dailmar and his
administration resign for the good
of the University, or Joe Ruetz
and the Athletic Department face
up to their responsibilities and
initiate impeachment proceedings
against these culprits, there will be
precious little to yell and cheer
about at Maples — this season or
any other.

Geology Wakeful
Editor:
I wish to make a public
apology to the Department of
Geology and the staff thereof. On
Feb. 7, the Daily quoted an
unfortunate statement that I had
made the night before in the.
"Progress in Medicine" lecture
series, in reference to sleepiness
and boredom; to wit, that the
study of geology is likely to make
one sleepy.
This was, on my part, an
unfortunate slip of the tongue. At
the moment of the statement, I
was actually trying to decide
which of two courses in my own
undergraduate experience was the
least exciting, a course on
geocarpology or one on
biotopology (the latter would be
quite interesting today, but 25
years ago, it was somewhat
lacking in form) and what Freud
called "condensation"
unfortunately took place,
resulting in neologistic utterance
"geology."
With regard to the fascinating
discipline of geology, I am one of
its most fervent admirers. From
my early days when I
accompanied my grandfather on
prospecting trips into the Hell's
Canyon area, my jolly college
field trips by the Columbia Basin
Badlands, up until my present
intense interest in the energy crisis
and mideastern oil crisis, I have
had nothing but the utmost
wakefulness provided by the
problems of the earth's crust.
Indeed, were it not for the fact
that my grandfather lost his shirt
when he bought the infamous
Cornucopia Mine after the vein
had petered out, thereby
establishing a lifelong family
bitterness against things mineral, I
would probably be a geologist
myself. Quite frankly, the thing
that puts me to sleep most

quickly is my own research!

Critique
Editor:
When a person reads a
newspaper review of a theatrical
production, he expects just that —
a critique of the actors'
performances and of directing
methods and technical aspects of
the production, not a lecture on
the meaning of the play. Any of
Stanford's highly literate students
can attempt an analysis of a play's
substance, but few can write a
decent review. Jennifer Randisi's
"review" of the Toyon
presentation of J.B. (Daily, Feb.
26) provided a term paper analysis
of Archibald MacLeish's play, and
an incorrect one at that.
Directed by Gioia (not Gloria)
Kelley, J.B. has much more to say
than Randisi indicated. Zuss and
Nickles only portray God and
satan. They have no real control
over J.B. All they can do is repeat
lines from the Book of Job,
comment, and watch what occurs.
