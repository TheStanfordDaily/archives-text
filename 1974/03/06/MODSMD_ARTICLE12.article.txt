Now is the time for all good
women ... to exercise their rights
and responsibilities through
policy-making positions.
Husbands, fathers, brothers and
uncles have too long been
women's principle representatives
when elected or appointed to
guard the welfare of the entire
population.
Consequently, legislation and
policies have dealt with unrealistic
stereotypes rather than the actual
needs and issues concerning both
sexes as well as women alone.
A series of programs and panel
discussions scheduled for
Stanford's Women's Day Fair was
organized to spotlight women
involved in politics and the law.
The participants are representative
of a growing number of females
publicly recognized for their
professional acumen.
Senate Candidate
Maya Miller, Democratic
candidate for U.S. Senator from
Nevada, will address the issue of
women and politics at noon in
Cubberley Auditorium on Friday,
March 8. She believes "America
these days is half-promise,
half-threat and the feeling that all
politics is the same, that you can't
beat the big money, that the 'Old
Boys' have it all sewed up, is very
widespread."
She substantiates her claim to
fighting this malaise with a
lengthy record of participation in
White House conferences as well as
membership in the National
Women's Political Caucus,
Women's Action Alliance and the
Nevada Federal Land Law Review
Committee.
Cathy O'Neill, another
candidate for political office, is a
Democrat aspiring to become
California secretary of state. She
will speak at 4 p.m. in the Alumni
Lounge of the Club House (near
Old Union) on Friday, March 8.
Currently a lecturer at the
University of Southern California
in the Center for Urban Affairs,
she conducted a grass roots
campaign in 1972 that brought
her to within one percentage
point of becoming the first female
state senator in the history of
California.
Earlier on Friday, at 10:30 in
Tresidder 270, three members of a
feminist law firm in San Francisco
will discuss "Women's Rights in
the Courts," speaking on the
different areas of law concerning
women.
Political Process
On Wednesday, March 6, at
3:30 in Geology 230, there will be
a panel presentation on Women in
the Political Process. Panel
members include attorney Marilyn
Patel, litigation counsel for NOW,
who will speak on the Equal
Rights Amendment and Suzanne
Paizis, author of "Political
Woman's Handbook," and
chairperson of the Santa Clara
County Commission on the Status
of Women. Paizis' topic will be
the methods needed to get more
women involved in political
action.
Marian Ash, editor/publisher of
Skirting the Capitol. a
Sacramento publication dealing
with legislation concerning
women, will address the issues of
currently pending legislation and
corrective laws that have yet to be
introduced. Miriam Goodman, the
fourth panel member, is the
founder and ex-president of the
San Francisco chapter of the
Women's National Political
Caucus and producer for a
feminist radio station. Nan
Keohane, a Stanford political
science professor, will moderate.
An informal discussion with
members of The Law Commune
and representatives from
Stanford's Women's Law
Association will take place at
noon on the lawn in front of Old
Union on Wednesday. Anyone
interested in a career as a legal
worker or lawyer will have an
opportunity to speak to women
already involved in the profession.
Sex Discrimination
On Thursday, March 7, the
question of sex discrimination will
come home to roost as a pane! of
Stanford personnel and students
discuss "Women in the University:
Is There Discrimination?"
Affirmative action programs
affecting faculty, staff and
students will be analyzed at the 2
