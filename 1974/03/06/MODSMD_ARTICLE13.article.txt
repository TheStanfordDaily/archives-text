# Editor Relates Media Experience
## 
### RITA STOLLMAN 
Southern California newspaper
editor Toni Frank says she never
considered pursuing a career other
than journalism after she received
her first byline at age 10, writing a
column of grammar school news
for the Salt Lake City Tribune.
That career has included such
diverse experiences as editing the
prose of authors like William
Saroyan for Argosy magazine in
New York and hand-printing her
own Pinch Penny Press. Produced
in the wine cellar of Berkeley's
famous Pot Luck Restaurant, that
publication featured some of the
first poems by such beatnik
celebrities as Alan Ginsberg,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti and
Richard Brautigan.
The 44-year-old editor of the
award-winning "Outlook on
Living" section of the Santa
Monica Evening Outlook is the
guest of the Stanford chapter of
Women in Communications, Inc.
as part of its contribution to the
International Women's Day Fair.
Today she will meet for an
informal lunch at Tresidder with

interested Stanford journalism
students. Yesterday she held a
newspaper page make-up lab and
discussed her experiences as a
woman journalist with interested
students.
W.I.C. President
Last year Frank was president
of the Los Angeles professional
chapter of Women in
Communication during the
turmoil surrounding its name and
image change from Theta Sigma
Phi.
Until the national organization
spearheaded the name change,
Frank claims, Theta Sigma Phi
was "more a sorority than a
professional organization."
Despite a threat by what she
called "all the older,
distinguished, moneyed members"
to secede from the national
organization, Frank held the
chapter together and has since
encouraged its acceptance of
many active young women
journalists.
Growing Up
Born of Mormon parents in a
log cabin in Victor, Idaho (she

said the doctor arrived by sled),
Frank spent most of her early
years in Utah where "everybody
seemed to be related to everybody
else" becasuse of the Mormon
practice of polygamy.
Each of her grandfathers, she
says, had three wives when they
made the trek by wagon train to
settle in the state. Despite a rule
against admitting offspring of
polygamous marriages, she claims
the Daughters of the American
Revolution still allowed her to
enter its ranks.
Her membership in the D.A.R.
contrasts sharply with her early
newspaper experience when, as a
staff member of the UCLA Daily
Bruin, she was investigated for
possible communist affiliations.
One of the student editors
actually was a "card-carrying
communist," she asserts, but most
were "little kids playing politics."
In addition to her bachelor's
degree in English from UCLA in
1953, Frank received awards as
the staffs best cub editor and best
reporter.
New York Work
After a stint as a reporter for
what she describes as a "dinky
little weekly in Los Angeles," she
took off for New York City to
work for both Argosy and
Adventure magazines. These
men's publications left her first
name off the masthead so no one
would know a woman worked for
them.
At Argosy, she says,"I had the
supreme pleasure of changing a
few well-chosen words of William
Saroyan. He never missed them.
He had sent the story in to pay
for his wife's new washing
machine."
Shortly after her marriage, she
and her husband, A 1 Frank, whom
she met in New York, returned to
California to begin hand-printing
the Pinch Penny Press.

A few years later she divorced
her husband and left the Pinch
Penny Press.
LA Again
Soon after, Frank moved to
Los Angeles and began working
for $95 a week as the women's
editor of the weekly Montrose
Ledger. After six years there, she
was still working an average 60
hours a week with no overtime
pay, she says.
In 1968 Frank moved to the
Evening Outlook, where she
served as women's editor until her
section took on the name
"Outlook on Living."
Frank says she is now working
to make all wedding and
engagement stories paid
advertisements instead of free
news copy. She wants to play
down these kinds of stories so
there is more room to "tackle
some of the subjects really
bugging women today."
