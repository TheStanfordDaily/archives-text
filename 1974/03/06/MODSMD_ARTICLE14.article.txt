# Unity House To Close After PACDAB Vote
## 
### 
Palo Alto's trouble-plagued
residential treatment center for
drug addicts will close Sunday
after a vote this week by the Palo
Alto Community Drug Abuse
Board (PACDAB).
The center, known as Unity
House, was located at 851
University Ave. PACDAB had
appointed former Venceremos
Central Committee Chairman
Aaron Manganiello as Unity
House's interim director last
Wednesday in the hope that he
could resolve problems of theft
and staff absenteeism at the
center.
However, Manganiello's doctor
recently ordered him to rest for a
month to recover from placement
of a metal plate over a part of his
skull that had to be removed after
an August cycle accident.
On Friday, PACDAB's
Executive Committee
recommended to the full board
that the center be closed because
of Manganiello's incapacitation.
Before PACDAB voted Sunday
to close Unity House, staff and
board members said that there had
been recurring instances of drug
usage at the center, detected late
last month by urinalysis tests.
PACDAB was also told that

there had been times when no
staff member was on duty at the
center and that unknown parties
had stolen nearly all the loose
property and equipment in the
center after the Executive
Committee's action Friday.
Palo Alto attorney Lincoln
Mitchell, a member of PACDAB,
said the "problem of Unity House
was a matter of leadership. Aaron
[Manganiello] potentially had the
ability, the background, the
experience, the respect of the
staff and the tough mindedness"
to straighten out the center's
difficulties.
Until PACDAB hired him six
weeks ago as a $625-a-month
Unity House staff member,
Manganiello had been a staff
member in the Medical School's
Pharmacology Department. There
he had worked with Prof. Avram
Goldstein on research into opiate
addiction.
PACDAB Chairman Joel
Davidson had said that
Manganiello, 31, is "just amazing
as far as knowing about drugs."
Although the motion to close
Unity House included the word
"temporarily," PACDAB
members have no idea whether
the center will ever open again.
