# Big Band Sound Still Cooking

SAN FRANCISCO—When one
begins naming "the last of the Big
Bands," it becomes apparent that
the bands are still here, it's the
audiences that are gone.
But, upon closer examination,
one finds that most Big Bands are
definitely on their last legs; not
because of any diminishing talent,
but purely due to the sad reality
of age.
Many other groups purporting
to be Big Bands — Buddy Rich,
Woody Herman, May nerd
Ferguson, Quincy Jones — no
longer play Big Band jazz.
One hope for real Big Band
music, both music-wise and

audience-wise, is the Thad
Jones-Mel Lewis Band, who made
an infrequent West Coast stop at
the Great American Music Hall,
Friday night.
The New York-based band
sports 17 fine musicians, both
young and old, black and white,
all wearing African dashikis.
Co-leader Thad Jones (cornet) is a
member of the famous Jones
Brothers of Detroit; Elvin
(drums), Hank (piano), Eddie
(bass).
With Jones out-front, "at the
helm" so to speak, the band
jumped through ten extremely
tight arrangements in the first set.
Beginning with "Quietude,"

spotlighting pianist Roland
Hannah, the band showed that
although its basic formula is
Swing, it does more than just echo
a past era. They evoked a sort of
Modern, post-bop feeling, while
still adhearing tightly to
fundamental Swing, and without
resorting to the Big Band
rock-gibberish of Herman or
Ferguson.
The band is now heading for a
tour of Japan. Hopefully they will
make a return stop on their way
back to New York.
