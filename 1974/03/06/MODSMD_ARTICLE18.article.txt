# Presented Through SCIRE
## 'Franny and Zooey' Stages Well 
### ERIC LAYMAN 
Franny and Zooey, a novel by
J.D. Salinger, was presented as a
play in the main lounge of Toyon
Hall Sunday nite. It came off
quite well and provided an
evening of heavy drama, lightened
by some very funny scenes. The
play was put on and adapted by a
group of students in the SCIRE
program.
Salinger's story concerns the
plight of Franny Glass, the
youngest child in a family of
geniuses, who returns home for
the weekend from her exclusive
eastern college and nearly suffers
a nervous breakdown.
Despite the presence of her
chicken soup-proffering mother,
Bessie, Franny's condition
worsens.
As the story develops, we learn
of the strong influence of the
eldest Glass children, Seymour
and Buddy, on the spiritual and
religious development of Franny
and Zooey, the youngest children.
Seymour committed suicide seven
years earlier (why, we are not
told), and Buddy is living
reclusively, teaching advanced
writing in a small college.
Impasse
Franny is bogged down by the
showy intellectualism and egotism
of the students and professors at
her school and she is paralyzed by
self-preoccupation. Zooey,
although beset by many of the
same problems, is not paralyzed.
In one of his impassioned
humorous diatribes he attempts to
extricate Franny from her
impasse. The play leaves some
doubt as to whether his attempts
were successful.
This particular production was
made for a small audience, due to

the size of the Toyon lounge. The
five areas where the action took
place were spread around the
periphery of the room, except for
one in the middle and one on an
elevated platform at the top of a
flight of stairs in one corner. The
audience was seated on the floor
in the midst of the action which
created a feeling of involvement.
The acting was quite good,
especially Marvin Diogenes'
characterization of Zooey and his
articulate, humorous and incisive
jabs at Bessie, his insight into the
heart of Franny's impasse and his
very direct, almost cruel approach
to the problem. Phil Greek, as
Buddy, deserves credit for
memorizing his sizeable
monologues.

The adaption of the novel to
the play was accurate, closely
following the book.
It is hard to isolate any one of
Salinger's stories and present it as
a single entity without confusing
the audience since his stories tend
to be interdependent. Having read
A Perfect Day for Bananafish and
Seymour: an Introduction, which
deal with Seymour and his
suicide, proved to be an advantage
in understanding the sequence of
events and the history of the Glass
family.
Final Scene
The ending of the play did
cause concern. After Zooey has
spoken to Franny, he finally
leaves, seeing that he is doing her
no good. Then, in a beautiful

scene, he goes into Seymour's old
room and calls her on the
telephone, pretending to be
Buddy, the older brother. She
finally realizes it is Zooey and he
then speaks to her down the
hallway in an almost desperate,
last ditch effort to make her
accept her own humanness and
that of the people around her.
Franny meanwhile sits pensively
on the couch and when Zooey is
done, she covers herself with a
blanket and the lights go out.
But the audience is left hanging
â€” has Zooey had any effect on
her or not? This is where I feel the
adaption falls short of the book,
because Salinger leaves Kranny
with a sudden sense of peace and
understanding at the end.
