# Wants Drug Treatment Resumed
## Terminal Patient Seeks Court Order 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
A cancer patient is seeking a
temporary restraining order to force
the University Hospital to resume her
treatment with the controversial drug
Laetrile.
Josephine Bergman's suit was heard
in San Jose Monday, and Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge John
Mclnverney is expected to announce
his decision today.
Bergman's illness was diagnosed as
terminal on Jan. 14, and a week later
Dr. Stewart Jones began treating her
with Laetrile, a substance also known
as vitamin 817 which is obtained from
peach and apricot pits.
Use of the drug for treating cancer
has been outlawed by the California
Department of Health, and the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).
Halt Ordered
A resident physician alerted
hospital administrators Feb. 14 that
Laetrile was being given to Bergman,
and Jones was ordered to stop the
treatment according to John Schwartz,
special assistant to the President for
legal affairs. Jones complied
immediately, Schwartz said, and the
20th dose administered Feb. 13 was
the last one Jones gave his patient.
George Kell, Bergman's attorney,
argued in court Monday that Jones
had prescribed Laetrile merely as
"nutritional therapy," and not
specifically as a cancer cure.
California's prohibition of the drug,
Kell said, is limited only to those cases
in which Laetrile is the intended
treatment for cancer.
'Increase Well-being'
Jones said he did not administer the
drug to Bergman to cure cancer, but
rather to increase her well-being by
"building up the natural defenses of
her body in the hope that it will be
able to fight off any disease, including
cancer."
Kell also cited a 1963 Cancer
Advisory Council report which stated
that although Laetrile was without

therapeutic value as a "specific
cancer-curing agent," it did produce
"subjective improvement" in patients
treated with the drug.
Bergman had shown signs of such
improvement during the period of her
treatment, Jones said, noting that her
"since of well-being, her appetite, and
her weight all increased." Since the
interruption of the treatment,
Bergman has become progressively
weaker, Jones said.
Jones attributed Bergman's
deteriorating condition exclusively to
stopping Laetrile treatment.

"Although resumption of the
treatment would improve her," Jones
added, "how much it would reverse
her condition is a matter of
speculation."
Jones said the hospital
administration's decision to prohibit
the use of Laetrile was "not a medical
decision but a political one," and
added that its actions were "a bunch
of crooked skullduggery to squelch the
legal use of Laetrile."
Merel Glaubiger, associate staff
counsel for the Medical Center, argued
in a brief submitted to the court

Monday that any treatment with
Laetrile is explicitly prohibited by the
California Department of Health, the
FDA, and the Sherman Law.
He also cited studies by the
National Cancer Institute, the
American Cancer Society, and the
California Cancer Commission to
refute Laetrile's therapeutic value.
If the judge is convinced by
Glaubiger's argument and refuses to
issue the restraining order, Bergman
said she would travel to Mexico to
finish the treatment. "I think I'm
going to come out of this smelling like
a rose," she said.

Bergman has become progressively
weaker, Jones said.
Jones attributed Bergman's
deteriorating condition exclusively to
stopping Laetrile treatment.

"Although resumption of the
treatment would improve her," Jones
added, "how much it would reverse
her condition is a matter of
speculation."
Jones said the hospital
administration's decision to prohibit
the use of Laetrile was "not a medical
decision but a political one," and
added that its actions were "a bunch
of crooked skullduggery to squelch the
legal use of Laetrile."
Merel Glaubiger, associate staff
counsel for the Medical Center, argued
in a brief submitted to the court

Monday that any treatment with
Laetrile is explicitly prohibited by the
California Department of Health, the
FDA, and the Sherman Law.
He also cited studies by the
National Cancer Institute, the
American Cancer Society, and the
California Cancer Commission to
refute Laetrile's therapeutic value.
If the judge is convinced by
Glaubiger's argument and refuses to
issue the restraining order, Bergman
said she would travel to Mexico to
finish the treatment. "I think I'm
going to come out of this smelling like
a rose," she said.
A cancer patient is seeking a
temporary restraining order to force
the University Hospital to resume her
treatment with the controversial drug
Laetrile.
Josephine Bergman's suit was heard
in San Jose Monday, and Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge John
Mclnverney is expected to announce
his decision today.
Bergman's illness was diagnosed as
terminal on Jan. 14, and a week later
Dr. Stewart Jones began treating her
with Laetrile, a substance also known
as vitamin 817 which is obtained from
peach and apricot pits.
Use of the drug for treating cancer
has been outlawed by the California
Department of Health, and the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).
Halt Ordered
A resident physician alerted
hospital administrators Feb. 14 that
Laetrile was being given to Bergman,
and Jones was ordered to stop the
treatment according to John Schwartz,
special assistant to the President for
legal affairs. Jones complied
immediately, Schwartz said, and the
20th dose administered Feb. 13 was
the last one Jones gave his patient.
George Kell, Bergman's attorney,
argued in court Monday that Jones
had prescribed Laetrile merely as
"nutritional therapy," and not
specifically as a cancer cure.
California's prohibition of the drug,
Kell said, is limited only to those cases
in which Laetrile is the intended
treatment for cancer.
'Increase Well-being'
Jones said he did not administer the
drug to Bergman to cure cancer, but
rather to increase her well-being by
"building up the natural defenses of
her body in the hope that it will be
able to fight off any disease, including
cancer."
Kell also cited a 1963 Cancer
Advisory Council report which stated
that although Laetrile was without

therapeutic value as a "specific
cancer-curing agent," it did produce
"subjective improvement" in patients
treated with the drug.
Bergman had shown signs of such
improvement during the period of her
treatment, Jones said, noting that her
"since of well-being, her appetite, and
her weight all increased." Since the
interruption of the treatment,
Bergman has become progressively
weaker, Jones said.
