The art exhibit currently on
display in Tresidder Union is a
pleasant journey for the eye.
Photographer and Stanford
Anthropology Professor Frank
Cancian has assembled 81
charming photographs of the
Zincatesco Indians of
Southeastern Mexico, a Mayan
tribe. All photographs are in
black and white. Cancian has
used light to accentuate the
facial features of the Zincantan
People. The emphasis on darks
enhances the serenity and
subtlety of the Zincantan life
style.
Most of the photos are
candid but there are also a few
strikingly good posed shots of
nothing but the faces of the
people set against almost pitch
black backgrounds.
Professor Cancian has
collected the photographs into
a book which will be published
by Scrimshaw in April under
the title Another Place:
Photographs of a Mayan
Community.
