# De Waart 'Drives To The Cadence'
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Last Wednesday avening's San
Francisco Symphony concert was
one of the finest concerts I have
ever heard.
Edo de Waart, recently
appointed director of the
Rotterdam Philharmonic, led the
orchestra through superb
performances of Mendelssohn's
Overture to Ruy . Bias and
Dvorak's Sixth Symphony.
Keyboard master Philippe

Entremont joined de Waart and
instrumentalists in a splendid
reading of Prokofieff's Third
Piano Concerto.
Maestro de Waart is an artist —
in every sense of that word.
Winner of the Dimitri Mitropoulos
Prize in 1964, de Waart spent a
year in New York as Leonard
Bernstein's assistant before
returning to his native Holland.
His clear and sensitive
conducting technique, masterful

sense of timing and balance, and
sheer musicianship are all but
unique. He is perhaps the finest
conductor San Francisco has
heard this year — bar none.
Mendelssohn's Ruy Bias
Overture opened the program
with a surge of brass and strings.
De Waart's powerful tempo never
flagged as conductor and
orchestra drove toward a forceful
climax in a uniquely moving
performance.
Philippe Entremont then
joined the orchestra for a dazzling
performance of Prokofieff's Third
Piano Concerto. One of the finest

of modern concerti, Prokofieff's
masterpiece displays its author's
pungently ironic wit and raw
creative power.
Entremont's playing provided
everything required: strong, biting
chords and arpeggi blended with
occasional lyric passages that all
but sang. De Waart brought up the
instrumental rear in marvellous
fashion, coordinating piano and
orchestral tempi and entrances
with superlative skill and taste.
Some listeners may have found
Entremont's passage-work a bit
rushed, though speed only
highlights this work's
uncompromising technical
demands.
But that unhesitating power —
that "drive to the cadence" — that
made Maestro de Waart's
Mendelssohn and Dvorak uniquely
effective, also brought the third
movement of Prokofieff's concerto
to a blazingly colorful climax.
Dvorak's little-known Sixth
Symphony concluded the
evening's program and proved its
musical apotheosis. De Waart's
faultless leadership coaxed the
loveliest and most poignant
phrasing from the musicians under
him; intonation was
breathtakingly clear, dynamic
balances and accents electrically
exciting.
Scarcely relaxing his
appropriately driving rhythms,
Maestro de Waart nonetheless
brought every nuance of Dvorak's
first-movement sonata structure —
particularly the development — to
vivid life. The slow movement was
transparency itself, the Scherzo
and Finale brilliantly hair-raising,
awesomely effective.

Symphony concluded the
evening's program and proved its
musical apotheosis. De Waart's
faultless leadership coaxed the
loveliest and most poignant
phrasing from the musicians under
him; intonation was
breathtakingly clear, dynamic
balances and accents electrically
exciting.
Scarcely relaxing his
appropriately driving rhythms,
Maestro de Waart nonetheless
brought every nuance of Dvorak's
first-movement sonata structure —
particularly the development — to
vivid life. The slow movement was
transparency itself, the Scherzo
and Finale brilliantly hair-raising,
awesomely effective.
Last Wednesday avening's San
Francisco Symphony concert was
one of the finest concerts I have
ever heard.
Edo de Waart, recently
appointed director of the
Rotterdam Philharmonic, led the
orchestra through superb
performances of Mendelssohn's
Overture to Ruy . Bias and
Dvorak's Sixth Symphony.
Keyboard master Philippe

Entremont joined de Waart and
instrumentalists in a splendid
reading of Prokofieff's Third
Piano Concerto.
Maestro de Waart is an artist —
in every sense of that word.
Winner of the Dimitri Mitropoulos
Prize in 1964, de Waart spent a
year in New York as Leonard
Bernstein's assistant before
returning to his native Holland.
His clear and sensitive
conducting technique, masterful

sense of timing and balance, and
sheer musicianship are all but
unique. He is perhaps the finest
conductor San Francisco has
heard this year — bar none.
Mendelssohn's Ruy Bias
Overture opened the program
with a surge of brass and strings.
De Waart's powerful tempo never
flagged as conductor and
orchestra drove toward a forceful
climax in a uniquely moving
performance.
Philippe Entremont then
joined the orchestra for a dazzling
performance of Prokofieff's Third
Piano Concerto. One of the finest

of modern concerti, Prokofieff's
masterpiece displays its author's
pungently ironic wit and raw
creative power.
Entremont's playing provided
everything required: strong, biting
chords and arpeggi blended with
occasional lyric passages that all
but sang. De Waart brought up the
instrumental rear in marvellous
fashion, coordinating piano and
orchestral tempi and entrances
with superlative skill and taste.
Some listeners may have found
Entremont's passage-work a bit
rushed, though speed only
highlights this work's
uncompromising technical
demands.
But that unhesitating power —
that "drive to the cadence" — that
made Maestro de Waart's
Mendelssohn and Dvorak uniquely
effective, also brought the third
movement of Prokofieff's concerto
to a blazingly colorful climax.
Dvorak's little-known Sixth
Symphony concluded the
evening's program and proved its
musical apotheosis. De Waart's
faultless leadership coaxed the
