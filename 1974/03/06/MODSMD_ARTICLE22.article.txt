# Two Fencers Qualify For National Meet
## 
### 
VAN NUYS—Two Stanford fencers qualified for the NCAA
championships last weekend, as the fencing teams made a good
showing in the Western Intercollegiate Fencing Championships at
Los Angeles Valley College.
Seniors Phil Michael, epee, and ISthan Merritt, foil, will
represent Stanford at the NCAA meet in Baltimore over spring
vacation. Michael finished third in the individual epee finals,
while Merritt just missed the finals in foil.
The epee team of Michael, Mark Eaton and Jay Harlow
finished seventh Friday among 16 teams, with a record of 9-6. Air
Force captured the team title and the top two individual spots.
Epee captain Richard Saunders had been a leading contender for
the team's NCAA spot, but missed the Westerns due to an inury,
and Michael got the nod.
On Saturday, the foil team of Merritt, Jack Handy and David
Wong placed fifth among 19 teams, with an overall record of 13-5
in team matches. Cal State-Northridge won the team foil trophy.
Handy nearly made the individual finals with a record of 11-7.
The inexperienced sabre team was less successful Sunday. With
Lee Vanderveld as the only primarily sabre fencer on the team
and Eaton, Harlow and Wong filling out the roster, Stanford
finished 13th among 16 entrants.
This weekend, the women's foil team will participate in the
Women's WIFC meet at San Jose State. Individual events
competition is Friday, and the team event Saturday. Coach Jean
Helliwell sees "a good chance of placing" in the top three with
Cal State-Fullerton as the toughest competition.
