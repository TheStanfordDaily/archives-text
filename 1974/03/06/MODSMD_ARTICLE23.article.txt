# Frost Hurls Cards Past Hayward, 5-2
## 
### 
Stanford played errorless
baseball and Dave Frost hurled
seven strong innings yesterday as
the Cards defeated Cal
State-Hayward, 5-2, at Hayward.
Stanford, now 4-8 for the
season, travels to Santa Clara
today for a 2:30 p.m. game
against the Broncos, before
returning home tomorrow for a
Sunken Diamond rematch against
Hayward.
Yesterday, Frost allowed only
four hits and one run in his
seven-inning stint. He made up for
occasional wildness — five walks
and two wild pitches — with seven
strikeouts. Bernie Hitner picked
up the save, allowing one run and
three hits in the final two innings.
The Cards scored twice on
"almost identical plays,"
according to team statistician
John Wright. In the third and
seventh, both times with runners
on first and second. Cardinal
hitters lashed line drives that
barely stayed fair on the third
base side.
In both instances, in the third
when Ken Egusa was the hitter
and in the seventh when Jon
Crosby was at the plate, the result
was a run-scoring double. In the
third, Mark Lucich drove in the
second run of the inning with an
infield out, and in the seventh
Gary Bei's sacrifice fly increased
the Cardinal lead to 4-0.
Stanford scored its fifth run in
the eighth when Lucich walked
and stole second. He advanced to
third when Dave Baker singled,
and then scored on a catcher's
throwing error as Baker stole
second base.
For the game, Baker had two
stolen bases and Lucich added
one. "We were running

aggressively," said Wright, and
"we looked good defensively."
A 1 Arthur (0-3) is scheduled to
pitch today at Santa Clara, with
John Yandle handling the mound
chores tomorrow against
Hay ward.
This weekend the Cards play
San Jose State three times,
traveling to San Jose for a single
game Friday and hosting the
Spartans Saturday in a 12 noon
doubleheader at Sunken
Diamond.

Stanford scored its fifth run in
the eighth when Lucich walked
and stole second. He advanced to
third when Dave Baker singled,
and then scored on a catcher's
throwing error as Baker stole
second base.
For the game, Baker had two
stolen bases and Lucich added
one. "We were running

aggressively," said Wright, and
"we looked good defensively."

John Yandle handling the mound
chores tomorrow against
Hay ward.
This weekend the Cards play
San Jose State three times,

Stanford played errorless
baseball and Dave Frost hurled
seven strong innings yesterday as
the Cards defeated Cal
State-Hayward, 5-2, at Hayward.
Stanford, now 4-8 for the
season, travels to Santa Clara
today for a 2:30 p.m. game
against the Broncos, before
returning home tomorrow for a
Sunken Diamond rematch against
Hayward.
Yesterday, Frost allowed only
four hits and one run in his
seven-inning stint. He made up for
occasional wildness — five walks
and two wild pitches — with seven
strikeouts. Bernie Hitner picked
up the save, allowing one run and
three hits in the final two innings.
The Cards scored twice on
"almost identical plays,"
according to team statistician
John Wright. In the third and
seventh, both times with runners
on first and second. Cardinal
hitters lashed line drives that
barely stayed fair on the third
base side.
In both instances, in the third
when Ken Egusa was the hitter
and in the seventh when Jon
Crosby was at the plate, the result
was a run-scoring double. In the
third, Mark Lucich drove in the
second run of the inning with an
infield out, and in the seventh
Gary Bei's sacrifice fly increased
the Cardinal lead to 4-0.
Stanford scored its fifth run in
the eighth when Lucich walked
and stole second. He advanced to
