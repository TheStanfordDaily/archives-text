# Cardinal Teams Await Pac-8 Tests
## Gymnasts Hope For Second 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Stanford's gymastics team flies
to Eugene, Ore. this afternoon to
prepare for a three-day
confrontation with Pacific Eight
rivals at the conference
championships on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
The compulsories will be
contested tomorrow evening,
followed by the optionals on
Friday. The combined score from
those nights will determine the
Pac-B's representative at the
NCAA championships in April.
On Saturday, the individual
competition will be held, with the
top three in each event also going
to the NCAA meet.
The Cards, with a 1-4 dual
meet record, would seem to be
out 112 the running, especially since
the four losses were all to Pac-8
schools. However, the team hasn't
competed at full strength this
season, mainly because of sickness
and injuries to key performers.
According to coach Sadao
Hamada, though, the squad is "in
pretty good shape now" and
should be in top form for the
Pac-B's.
The concensus favorite is
California, the defending
conference champion responsible
for two of Stanford's losses this
season. The Bears combine several
excellent all-around performers
with enough specialists to provide
the depth which the Cards are
sorely lacking.
Stanford's depth problems are
most keenly felt in the parallel
bars and the high bar. The Cards
have consistently been forced to
enter only three competitors in
one or both of the events, the
minimum number to score
without giving away points.
Realistically, the possibility of
a team victory is rather slight.
Hamada is nevertheless optimistic.
"If everybody hits their routines
perfectly, we have a chance," he
said. On paper at least, it appears
the real battle will be for second,
with Stanford, Oregon,
Washington and possibly
Washington State all fairly evenly
matched.
Individually, the Cards have
several of the top gymnasts in the
conference. Stanford performers
won all but two of the six
individual events as well as
capturing the all-around in last
year's Pac-8 meet.
The all-around, parallel bars
and high bar were won by Steve
Hug. Hug also took the all-around
at the NCAA meet. Ted Marcy
won his specialty, the sidehourse,
and Howard Bessen took the rings
in the 1973 conference meet.
Shawn Skerrett was runner-up in
the vault.
Besides those four, all of whom
return this year, all-around
performer Bob Anderson is a
contender for an NCAA berth.
Anderson, who missed the last
meet of the season with a back
injury, has spent the last three
weeks recovering, and according
to Hamada is in "pretty good
shape."
Ted Miyamoto is Stanford's
third all-around man. He was
injured in a collision on the mat
last week but is expected to be
recovered by competition time.

PAC-8 HOPEFUL—Ted Miyamoto, shown here competing on the high
bar as coach Sadao Hamada looks on, will be one of Stanford's three
entrants in the all-around competition at the Pac-8 championships in
Eugene, Ore. The meet begins tomorrow and continues through
Saturday.
Stanford's gymastics team flies
to Eugene, Ore. this afternoon to
prepare for a three-day
confrontation with Pacific Eight
rivals at the conference
championships on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
The compulsories will be
contested tomorrow evening,
followed by the optionals on
Friday. The combined score from
those nights will determine the
Pac-B's representative at the
NCAA championships in April.
On Saturday, the individual
competition will be held, with the
top three in each event also going
to the NCAA meet.
The Cards, with a 1-4 dual
meet record, would seem to be
out 112 the running, especially since
the four losses were all to Pac-8
schools. However, the team hasn't
competed at full strength this
season, mainly because of sickness
and injuries to key performers.
According to coach Sadao
Hamada, though, the squad is "in
pretty good shape now" and
should be in top form for the
Pac-B's.
The concensus favorite is
California, the defending
conference champion responsible
for two of Stanford's losses this
season. The Bears combine several
excellent all-around performers
with enough specialists to provide
the depth which the Cards are
sorely lacking.
Stanford's depth problems are
most keenly felt in the parallel
bars and the high bar. The Cards
have consistently been forced to
enter only three competitors in
one or both of the events, the
minimum number to score
without giving away points.
Realistically, the possibility of
a team victory is rather slight.
Hamada is nevertheless optimistic.
"If everybody hits their routines
perfectly, we have a chance," he
said. On paper at least, it appears
the real battle will be for second,
with Stanford, Oregon,
Washington and possibly
Washington State all fairly evenly
matched.
Individually, the Cards have
several of the top gymnasts in the
conference. Stanford performers
won all but two of the six
individual events as well as
capturing the all-around in last
year's Pac-8 meet.
The all-around, parallel bars
and high bar were won by Steve
Hug. Hug also took the all-around
at the NCAA meet. Ted Marcy
won his specialty, the sidehourse,
and Howard Bessen took the rings
in the 1973 conference meet.
Shawn Skerrett was runner-up in
the vault.
Besides those four, all of whom
return this year, all-around
performer Bob Anderson is a
contender for an NCAA berth.
Anderson, who missed the last
meet of the season with a back
injury, has spent the last three
weeks recovering, and according
to Hamada is in "pretty good
shape."
Ted Miyamoto is Stanford's
third all-around man. He was
injured in a collision on the mat
last week but is expected to be
recovered by competition time.
