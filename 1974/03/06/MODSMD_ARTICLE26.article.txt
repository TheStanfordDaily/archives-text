# All-Star Teams Announced
## Kelley Honored, Snubbed 
### 
Rich Kelley was honored by
the Northern California Basketball
Writers and snubbed by United
Press International yesterday as
the first wave of post-season
All-Star teams were announced.
The seven-foot junior was
selected to the All-Northern
California first team, along with
Phil Smith and Kevin Restani of
USF, John Errecart of Pacific and
Maurice Harper of St. Mary's.
Smith was named player of the
year, and Frank LaPorte of St.
Mary's was elected coach of the
year.
UPI, meanwhile, came out with
the first All-American team, and
didn't even list Kelley among its
honorable mention choices. Bill
Walton and Keith Wilkes of UCLA
were named to the first team,
along with North Carolina State's
David Thompson, Notre Dame's
John Shumate and Providence's
Marvin Barnes. No Pac-8 players
were selected on either the second
or third teams, but Ron Lee of
Oregon and Tommy Curtis of
UCLA were honorable mention
choices.
"If Ron Lee isn't at least
second team, there's no such thing
as an All-American," said
Stanford assistant coach Billy
Jones.
The ommission of Kelley from
the honorable mention list also
seemed ridiculous, especially since
Curtis, who isn't even among the
top two guards in Los Angeles,
was named to the squad.
Sophomore Ed Schweitzer
earned a post-season honor with
his selection to the TVS Pac-8

All-Sophomore team. Lee,
Washington's Clarence Ramsey,
Cal's Rickie Hawthorne, USC's
Bob Trowbridge and Washington's
Lars Hansen joined Schweitzer on
the six-man squad.
Named to the TVS
All-Freshman team were Oregon's
Greg Ballard, UCLA's Marques
Johnson, Washington's Chester
Dorsey, Washington State's Steve
Puidokas and Oregon State's
Lonnie Shelton.

In Pac-8 action Monday night,
Oregon took advantage of Gerald
Willett's 20 points, 18 by Ron Lee
and four technical fouls by
Washington State to roll past the
Courgars, 92-61 in Pullman.
At Seattle, Larry Pounds
poured in 20 points to lead
Washington to a 68-63 victory
over Oregon State.
