## Flyers Ruin Philadelphia's Image 
### Don Tollefson 
To listen to most comedians these days,
you'd think that as soon as the energy crisis
diminishes and the gas lines decrease, they'll
be completely out of material. But we
mustn't forget that some jokes have stood
the test of time. Take Philadelphia, for
instance.
World wars have come and gone, but
Philly has continued to hang tough as the
most joked about municipality in the
country. In recent years, Philadelphia's
athletic teams have done their best to
maintain the city's image, and with a few
exceptions, they have succeeded brilliantly.
But now one Philadelphia team has the
gall to violate a sacred tradition. The Flyers
of the National Hockey League seem not
only determined to perform as well as any
NHL expansion team ever has, but they also
appear convinced they can win the Stanley
Cup. Philadelphia will never be the same.
Sunday night, Flyer goalie Bernie Parent
recorded his 11th shutout of the season as
Philly demolished the World Champion
Montreal Canadiens 6-0. Those are the same
Canadiens that last year Sports Illustrated
said "have more than enough firepower to
storm the Bastille." The Bastille perhaps, but
at least on Sunday night, not the Philadelphia
Spectrum.
Always Beat You Up
To really understand the Flyers, you have
to read beyond the scoring summaries and
look at the rundown of penalties

accumulated during a game. In an average
Flyer game, the penalty summary closely
resembles the team roster. Against Montreal,
the Flyers supplemented their six goals with
a mere 36 minutes of penalty time that
included two fighting assessments and one
game misconduct. If the Flyers can't beat
you, they'll surely beat you up. And if they
can beat you, they'll beat you up anyway.
It's a philosophy that would make Oregon
basketball coach Dick Harter proud.
Like a well-trained army, the Flyers
always attack you on two sides. On the one
side there's the scoring artillery which centers
around the bazooka-like shots of Bobby
Clarke and Rick MacLeish. Then there's the
hand-to-hand combat division spearheaded
by Bob (Hound) Kelly and Dave (Hammer)
Schultz.
Kelly epitomizes the change the
Philadelphians have undergone in the last two
seasons. He had scored a mere 14 goals
during both the '70-'7l and '71-'72 seasons
as the Flyers played a fast, Lut extremely
clean style of hockey that got them nowhere.
Then last season, Kelly and the Flyers
radically changed their hockey style and
begun to win games.
League Leader
Kelly piled up 238 penalty minutes last
season, but lost the team battle to Schultz,
who had 259. As a team, the Flyers served
1754 penalty minutes which was exactly 559
more than the second most penalized team,

the St. Louis Blues. But believe it or not, the
Flyers scored 74 power play goals, while
allowing 60.
The secret to their success is that the
Flyers rarely go to the penalty box by
themselves. In the great spirit of sharing, they
always try to take an opponent with them.
Sunday night, Montreal players spent 38
minutes in the box, which was two more
than the Flyers' total.
As one NHL player has said, "Schultz and
Kelly make the old big bad Bruins seem like a
bunch of Little Lord Fauntleroys." No one
can deny the success of Philadelphia's rough
approach. While the team was setting that
league penalty record, Clarke* was becoming
the NHL's Most Valuable Player, MacLeish
was scoring 50 goals (most ever by an
expansion-team player) and the Flyers were
playing competitively with the NHL's elite.
Team general manager Keith Allen
correctly credits the Flyers' turnaround to
"the development of a more physical brand
of hockey that would make us respected
everywhere we played in the NHL."
Those who feel the Flyers should revert to
their low-key style of mediocre hockey really
don't understand the sport. Ice hockey is an
extremely fast sport which is inevitably full
of considerable physical contact.
Intimidation and contact are integral parts of
the sport and players accept this atmosphere
of controlled conflict just as race drivers
accept the danger inherent in their sport.

Flyers scored 74 power play goals, while
allowing 60.
The secret to their success is that the
Flyers rarely go to the penalty box by
themselves. In the great spirit of sharing, they
always try to take an opponent with them.
Sunday night, Montreal players spent 38
minutes in the box, which was two more
than the Flyers' total.
As one NHL player has said, "Schultz and
Kelly make the old big bad Bruins seem like a
bunch of Little Lord Fauntleroys." No one
can deny the success of Philadelphia's rough
approach. While the team was setting that
league penalty record, Clarke* was becoming
the NHL's Most Valuable Player, MacLeish
was scoring 50 goals (most ever by an
expansion-team player) and the Flyers were
playing competitively with the NHL's elite.
Team general manager Keith Allen
correctly credits the Flyers' turnaround to
"the development of a more physical brand
of hockey that would make us respected
everywhere we played in the NHL."
Those who feel the Flyers should revert to
their low-key style of mediocre hockey really
don't understand the sport. Ice hockey is an
extremely fast sport which is inevitably full
of considerable physical contact.
Intimidation and contact are integral parts of
the sport and players accept this atmosphere
of controlled conflict just as race drivers
accept the danger inherent in their sport.
To listen to most comedians these days,
you'd think that as soon as the energy crisis
diminishes and the gas lines decrease, they'll
be completely out of material. But we
mustn't forget that some jokes have stood
the test of time. Take Philadelphia, for
instance.
World wars have come and gone, but
Philly has continued to hang tough as the
most joked about municipality in the
country. In recent years, Philadelphia's
athletic teams have done their best to
maintain the city's image, and with a few
exceptions, they have succeeded brilliantly.
But now one Philadelphia team has the
gall to violate a sacred tradition. The Flyers
of the National Hockey League seem not
only determined to perform as well as any
NHL expansion team ever has, but they also
appear convinced they can win the Stanley
Cup. Philadelphia will never be the same.
Sunday night, Flyer goalie Bernie Parent
recorded his 11th shutout of the season as
Philly demolished the World Champion
Montreal Canadiens 6-0. Those are the same
Canadiens that last year Sports Illustrated
said "have more than enough firepower to
storm the Bastille." The Bastille perhaps, but
at least on Sunday night, not the Philadelphia
Spectrum.
Always Beat You Up
To really understand the Flyers, you have
to read beyond the scoring summaries and
look at the rundown of penalties

accumulated during a game. In an average
Flyer game, the penalty summary closely
resembles the team roster. Against Montreal,
the Flyers supplemented their six goals with
a mere 36 minutes of penalty time that
included two fighting assessments and one
game misconduct. If the Flyers can't beat
you, they'll surely beat you up. And if they
can beat you, they'll beat you up anyway.
It's a philosophy that would make Oregon
basketball coach Dick Harter proud.
Like a well-trained army, the Flyers
always attack you on two sides. On the one
side there's the scoring artillery which centers
around the bazooka-like shots of Bobby
Clarke and Rick MacLeish. Then there's the
hand-to-hand combat division spearheaded
by Bob (Hound) Kelly and Dave (Hammer)
Schultz.
Kelly epitomizes the change the
Philadelphians have undergone in the last two
seasons. He had scored a mere 14 goals
during both the '70-'7l and '71-'72 seasons
as the Flyers played a fast, Lut extremely
clean style of hockey that got them nowhere.
Then last season, Kelly and the Flyers
radically changed their hockey style and
begun to win games.
League Leader
Kelly piled up 238 penalty minutes last
season, but lost the team battle to Schultz,
who had 259. As a team, the Flyers served
1754 penalty minutes which was exactly 559
more than the second most penalized team,

the St. Louis Blues. But believe it or not, the
Flyers scored 74 power play goals, while
allowing 60.
The secret to their success is that the
Flyers rarely go to the penalty box by
