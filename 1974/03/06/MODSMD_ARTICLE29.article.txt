# Swimmers Face Final Warmup For NCAA's
## 
### STEVE BAKER 
The Stanford swimming team
travels to Seattle today for the
Pacific Eight Championships.
Hosted by the Washington
Huskies, the Pac-8 is the final step
in preparation for the NCAA's.
And while its significance
compared to the NCAA's is
miniscule, the swimmers and
coaches will be taking each race
very seriously. The fact that this is
the last meet before the NCAA's
gives it plenty of importance.
The conference championships,
which begin tomorrow and
continue through Saturday should
be dominated by USC. Winner in
11 of the last 13 seasons, the
Trojans rank second in the nation.
Some of SC's greatest strength
comes from its freshmen
swimmers. Three post the best
college times in the nation this
year â€” Joe Bottom in the 50-yard
freestyle, Scott Brown in the
200-yard individual medley and
John Naber in the 200-yard
backstroke.
Host Washington has three
outstanding freshmen of its own.
Rick DeMont, Robin Backhaus
and Doug Northway were each
members of the 1972 Olympic
Team. DeMont leads the nation in
the 1000 free while Backhaus
ranks number-one in the 200
butterfly.
Stanford will be led by
Olympians John Hencken and
Dave Fairbank and two
outstanding relays. However, most

Cards will be swimming
"through" the conference
championships, aiming for the
NCAA's. In fact, coach Jim
Gaughran doesn't plan to rest his
charges at all. While in Seattle, he
plans to have a four to five
thousand-yard workout each
morning before the meet.
Qualifying Standards
The only Cards who will be
completely rested are those trying
to make the standards for the
national championships. Richard
Cook, Jack Deppe, Rick Gebers,
Rick Lambert and Ron Longinotti
have peaked and should be well
rested.
Diver Wayne Wager will be
hoping to score high on the
three-meter board to qualify for
the nationals. Earlier this year,
Wayne qualified for the
one-meter. A freshman from
Bellvue, Wash. Wayne should
place high this weekend.
Two of the biggest success
stories of the year are Steve
Strong and Terry Sutton.
Competing in both the 500 and
the 1000, Steve and Terry have
provided an awesome one-two
punch, scoring many key points in
dual meets this year. Probably
their greatest moment in dual
meet competition came against
UCLA this year when they swept
the 1000.
Outstanding Times
Strong, a sophomore from
Tucson, has clocked a 4:41.1 in
the 500 and a 9:42 in the 1000.
Sutton, a senior from Cincinnati,
has done a 4:41.7 and a 9:36.26.
Both are confident of even greater
success at the NCAA's.
While USC should take this
weekend's meet going away, the
battle for second and third should
be close. Stanford defeated both
Washington and UCLA In dual
meets, but the concensus is that
Washington's depth will carry the
Huskies to a second place Pac-8
finish.
It is debatable, however, who
will finish third between Stanford
and UCLA. Both teams are aiming
for the NCAA's, but the battle for
third place remains important.

Swimming Notes: After leading
the nation all year, John Hencken
was ousted from his first place
ranking in the 200 breaststroke
last week by Miami's David
Wilkie.... The Cards compiled a
7-1 dual meet record, their only
loss coming to USC by the score
of 82-31.
