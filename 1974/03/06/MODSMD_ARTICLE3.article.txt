# Cole Defeats Goldstein For School Board Seat
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
Dr. Royce Cole won reelection to
the Palo Alto school board last night
by a plurality of more than 1000 votes
over runner-up Joshua Goldstein.
District voters also voted
overwhelmingly to pass a tax override
which adds $1.5 million to the
1974-75 Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) budget.
Approximately 70 percent of the
voters supported the measure and 30
percent were opposed.
The override maintains the current
property tax rate for education at
$5.97 per $100 assessed valuation and
increases the expenditure per ADA
(Average Daily Attendance) $134 over
the current rate of $1642. The ADA is
a figure based on theoretical number
of full-time students in a district.
State law calculates the amount a
district can spend by its ADA. Because
Palo Alto is losing 400 students per
year, the district would have had to
lower its tax rate and to reduce its
t'idget — without the local override.
Cole, running for his second

five-year term, surmounted a strong
showing by Goldstein a researcher at
the Stanford Institute for Political
Studies. With 35 out of 38 precincts
reporting, Cole had captured 5192 (43
percent) votes to Goldstein's 3951 (32
percent). Paul Pease, an advertising
agency president, ran a distant third
with 2028 (18 percent) of the 12,115
votes reported.
Alice Stratton garnered 865 votes
(six percent) of the total, and Claire
Smith ran last with 159 votes (one
percent).
The five Stanford precincts backed
the override by a huge margin of 1055
votes to 185. Most campus voters gave
their support in the school board
election to Goldstein. The final count
for Stanford was 772 for Goldstein,
202 for Cole, 199 for Pease, 60 for
Stratton and 16 for Smith.
Early returns in scattered Palo A '*"
precincts gave Goldstein an earl'
but Cole's strongholds in Credent
Park and Walter Hays precincts began
to report in.
In addition, incumbent Cole easily

carried most of the "swing" precincts,
such as El Carmelo, De Anza, and
Jordan which some observers had
thought could go to either candidate.
Cole soon surged to a 10 percent lead
over Goldstein and held it through the
rest of the evening.
The voters supported the
controversial tax override to a greater
extent than even its advocates had
hoped for. Before the revenue
election, several key backers of the
revenue-based ballot, including School
Board President Donald Hammond,
had said that the expenditure increase
might not pass. They cited voter
dissatisfaction with high school taxes
and with school priorities set by the
administration as reasons for a
potential backlash against more school
spending.
~ Richard Smallwood, chairman
the Committee for Adequate
School Education, a strong proponent
of the override, said that the high
margin of passage indicated that the
voters were willing to give the school
district what it asked for: one year in
which to plan priorities for the future.
However, a Palo Alto high school
student felt that most voters gave the
plan grudging approval. He said that
many people voted for the override to
prevent what they feared were cuts in
educational quality.
The Board had campaigned for the
override on the grounds that without
it, $2.3 million would have to be cut
from the projected 1974-75 budget of
$28 million.
Such cuts would necessitate the
firing of 130 personnel, including
many young untenured teachers, and
the dropping of a number of
innovative school programs, the Board
had said.
According to the Board figures, the
passage of the override means that
only $885,000 will have to be
trimmed and that all personnel will
probably get some kind of a
cost-of-living raise.

the Palo Alto school board last night
by a plurality of more than 1000 votes
over runner-up Joshua Goldstein.
District voters also voted
overwhelmingly to pass a tax override
which adds $1.5 million to the
1974-75 Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) budget.
Approximately 70 percent of the
voters supported the measure and 30
percent were opposed.
The override maintains the current
property tax rate for education at
$5.97 per $100 assessed valuation and
increases the expenditure per ADA
(Average Daily Attendance) $134 over
the current rate of $1642. The ADA is
a figure based on theoretical number
of full-time students in a district.
State law calculates the amount a
district can spend by its ADA. Because
Palo Alto is losing 400 students per
year, the district would have had to
lower its tax rate and to reduce its
t'idget — without the local override.
Cole, running for his second

five-year term, surmounted a strong
showing by Goldstein a researcher at
the Stanford Institute for Political
Studies. With 35 out of 38 precincts
reporting, Cole had captured 5192 (43
percent) votes to Goldstein's 3951 (32
percent). Paul Pease, an advertising
agency president, ran a distant third
with 2028 (18 percent) of the 12,115
votes reported.
Alice Stratton garnered 865 votes
(six percent) of the total, and Claire
Smith ran last with 159 votes (one
percent).
The five Stanford precincts backed
the override by a huge margin of 1055
votes to 185. Most campus voters gave
their support in the school board
election to Goldstein. The final count
for Stanford was 772 for Goldstein,
202 for Cole, 199 for Pease, 60 for
Stratton and 16 for Smith.
Early returns in scattered Palo A '*"
precincts gave Goldstein an earl'
but Cole's strongholds in Credent
Park and Walter Hays precincts began
to report in.
In addition, incumbent Cole easily

carried most of the "swing" precincts,
such as El Carmelo, De Anza, and
Jordan which some observers had
thought could go to either candidate.
Cole soon surged to a 10 percent lead
over Goldstein and held it through the
rest of the evening.
The voters supported the
controversial tax override to a greater
extent than even its advocates had
hoped for. Before the revenue
election, several key backers of the
revenue-based ballot, including School
Board President Donald Hammond,
had said that the expenditure increase
might not pass. They cited voter
dissatisfaction with high school taxes
and with school priorities set by the
administration as reasons for a
potential backlash against more school
spending.
~ Richard Smallwood, chairman
the Committee for Adequate
School Education, a strong proponent
of the override, said that the high
margin of passage indicated that the
voters were willing to give the school
district what it asked for: one year in
which to plan priorities for the future.
However, a Palo Alto high school
student felt that most voters gave the
plan grudging approval. He said that
many people voted for the override to
prevent what they feared were cuts in
educational quality.
The Board had campaigned for the
override on the grounds that without
it, $2.3 million would have to be cut
from the projected 1974-75 budget of
$28 million.
Such cuts would necessitate the
firing of 130 personnel, including
many young untenured teachers, and
the dropping of a number of
innovative school programs, the Board
had said.
According to the Board figures, the
passage of the override means that
only $885,000 will have to be
trimmed and that all personnel will
probably get some kind of a
cost-of-living raise.
