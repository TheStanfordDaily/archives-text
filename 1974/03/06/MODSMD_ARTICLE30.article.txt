# Winter Net Schedule Ends With Easy Wins
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
concluded its leisurely winter
quarter schedule with a pair of 8-1
wins over UC-Irvine and San Jose
State Monday and yesterday.
All but one of the Cardinals'
top 12 players saw some action
during the two matches, in
keeping with coach Dick Gould's
policy of rotating his lineup. That
one, Sandy Mayer, hasn't exactly
been loafing, though.
Mayer, won the U.S. Lawn
Tennis Federation tournament at
Paramus, N.J. last weekend,
beating Jeff Austin, lan Fletcher
and Jurgen Fassbender in the final
three rounds. Mayer now ranks
second in the USLTA standings,
behind only Jimmy Connors, and
would have won $17,975 if he
hadn't decided to remain an
amateur.
Of the other 11 players, all
won at least once over the
two-day span. Pat DuPre made his
season debut against Irvine here,
the NCAA College Division
champion, by beating Bob
Chappell 6-4, 6-2 at first singles.
Chappel knocked off Rick Fisher
when the two teams met last year.
Other singles winners included
John Whitlinger, Mark Mitchell,
Chico Hagey, Gene Mayer and
Chip Fisher, while
DuPre-Whitlinger and Nick

Saviano-Paul Sidone won at
doubles. Only the third doubles
team of Craig Johnson-Jake Warde
lost a match.
The highlight of yesterday's
match at San Jose may have been
the unexpected presence of Jim
Delaney at first singles. Delaney,
hurriedly called in to replace
Mitchell, who is ill, responded
with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Andy
Moffat. Gene Mayer, Fisher,
Hagey and Johnson all won at
second through fifth singles. The
only loss of the day came at the
final singles slot, where Bruce
Antal knocked off Warde 6-4, 6-4.
Delaney, who'll play doubles
with NCAA championship partner
Sandy Mayer once the season
starts in earnest, had little trouble
winning at second doubles
yesterday with Sandy's brother
Gene.
Other wins came from
Hagey-Fisher at first doubles and
Johnson-Warde at the third
doubles slot.
While there are no more
official matches until April, Gould
is sending three teams to the
Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
tournament in LaJolla this
weekend. Two fairly experienced
teams Hagey-Fisher and
DuPre-Whitlinger are entered,
along with Mitchell-Gene Mayer.

Mitchell, who is ill, responded
with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Andy
Moffat. Gene Mayer, Fisher,
Hagey and Johnson all won at
second through fifth singles. The
only loss of the day came at the
final singles slot, where Bruce
Antal knocked off Warde 6-4, 6-4.
Delaney, who'll play doubles
with NCAA championship partner
Sandy Mayer once the season
starts in earnest, had little trouble
winning at second doubles
yesterday with Sandy's brother
Gene.
Other wins came from
Hagey-Fisher at first doubles and
Johnson-Warde at the third
doubles slot.
While there are no more
official matches until April, Gould
is sending three teams to the
Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
tournament in LaJolla this
weekend. Two fairly experienced
teams Hagey-Fisher and
DuPre-Whitlinger are entered,
along with Mitchell-Gene Mayer.
Stanford's varsity tennis team
concluded its leisurely winter
quarter schedule with a pair of 8-1
wins over UC-Irvine and San Jose
State Monday and yesterday.
All but one of the Cardinals'
top 12 players saw some action
during the two matches, in
keeping with coach Dick Gould's
policy of rotating his lineup. That
one, Sandy Mayer, hasn't exactly
been loafing, though.
Mayer, won the U.S. Lawn
Tennis Federation tournament at
Paramus, N.J. last weekend,
beating Jeff Austin, lan Fletcher
and Jurgen Fassbender in the final
three rounds. Mayer now ranks
second in the USLTA standings,
behind only Jimmy Connors, and
would have won $17,975 if he
hadn't decided to remain an
amateur.
Of the other 11 players, all
won at least once over the
two-day span. Pat DuPre made his
season debut against Irvine here,
the NCAA College Division
champion, by beating Bob
Chappell 6-4, 6-2 at first singles.
Chappel knocked off Rick Fisher
when the two teams met last year.
Other singles winners included
John Whitlinger, Mark Mitchell,
Chico Hagey, Gene Mayer and
Chip Fisher, while
DuPre-Whitlinger and Nick

Saviano-Paul Sidone won at
doubles. Only the third doubles
team of Craig Johnson-Jake Warde
lost a match.
The highlight of yesterday's
match at San Jose may have been
the unexpected presence of Jim
Delaney at first singles. Delaney,
hurriedly called in to replace
Mitchell, who is ill, responded
with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Andy
Moffat. Gene Mayer, Fisher,
Hagey and Johnson all won at
second through fifth singles. The
only loss of the day came at the
final singles slot, where Bruce
Antal knocked off Warde 6-4, 6-4.
