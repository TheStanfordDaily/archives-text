Oil Embargo May End Soon
WASHINGTON — Optimism that the Arabs will
/mpletely lift their oil embargo against the United
tates continued here yesterday as Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger briefed President Nixon on
his Middle East trip.
Kissinger spent 45 minutes with Nixon at the
White House. Afterward, Gerald L. Warren, the
deputy press secretary turned aside all questions
with the comment, "the embargo is a matter for the
Arab countries to address."
However, other U.S. officials said any
assumption other than they are hoping for a
removal when the Arab oil ministers meet Sunday in
Libya "would be absurd."
An early end to the Arab oil embargo might ease
the threat of gasoline rationing but would not
necessarily bring a quick return to business as usual.
It probably would take at least a month for
tankers carrying Arab oil to begin reaching the
United States once the embargo is lifted, and it
could be several weeks more before the rate of
imports increased to pre-embargo levels.
Authoritative U.S. sources, hoping that a meeting
of Arab oil ministers scheduled for next Sunday
would bring an end to the embargo, nevertheless
seemed to think it would not lead to unrestrained
production.
Instead, the expectation appeared to lean toward
a return to pre-embargo production levels, requiring
continued U.S. conservation efforts.
Lawyers Request Meeting
WASHINGTON - White House lawyers
reportedly have asked for a meeting with the House
Judiciary Committee staff to discuss the
committee's request for evidence for its
impeachment inquiry. Committee sources say James
D. St. Clair, in charge of the President's
impeachment defense, asked to meet today with
committee lawyers.
Yesterday the White House asked for one more
day to respond to the committee's request for
evidence for its impeachment inquiry, averting an
immediate resort by the committee to its subpoena
power.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., left little
doubt, however, that a subpoena will be issued if
the White House fails to deliver the requested
material on schedule.
"The committee is of a mind to exercise its
power of subpoena if there is a refusal to honor our
request for information," Rodino said at a news
conference after a closed session of the committee.
The issuance of a subpoena could raise a serious
constitutional question if President Nixon invokes
his presidential powers to resist the congressional
power of impeachment.
Rodino said the committee also feels that its
constitutional authority to conduct impeachment
proceedings is sufficient to give it access to the
secret evidence and findings delivered to U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica by the Watergate grand

jury, if it bears on the investigation.
Republican Wins House Race
VENTURA — A Republican bucked a trend of
Democratic Congressional upsets yesterday and
swept to victory in a long-help GOP House seat in
Southern California.
State Senator Robert J. Lagomarsino, 47, of
Ojai, compiled an overwhelming lead over a cluster
of seven Democratic challengers who campaigned on
the Watergate issue in varying degrees.
Of four special Congressional elections held so
far this year, all in previously Republican districts, it
was the first in which a Republican won.
With 407 of 480 precincts reporting,
Lagomarsino had 42,135 to 36,977 for all seven
Democrats combined, a margin of 53 percent. His
nearest rival, James Loebl, had 15,514 votes.
Lagomarsino was the only Republican on the
ballot.
Lagomarsino outdistanced all of his challengers
in California's 13th Congressional District with
more than 50 percent of the vote to win the seat of
the late Rep. Charles M. Teague, a Republican who
represented the district in Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties for 19 years.
The Democrats hoped to consolidate the vote,
partly with the Watergate issue, to force
Lagomarsino into an April 2 runoff. But with his
sweeping victory, Lagomarsino will take his seat in
Washington within a few days.
Democrat Wins Ohio Seat
CINCINNATI, Ohio — Democrat Thomas A.
Luken defeated Republican Willis D. Gradison Jr. in
an Ohio congressional election yesterday.
Republican leaders, some openly and some
privately, blamed Watergate and President Nixon for
the defeat.
Voters in the traditionally Republican Ist
District turned their backs on the Republican
candidate for only the fourth time this century.
In 1972, President Nixon polled 67 percent of
the district's vote, and William J. Keating, whose
resignation created the congressional vacancy,
polled 70 percent.
Wilson Picks Left-Wing Cabinet
LONDON — Prime Minister Harold Wilson chose
a new cabinet with a left-wing look yesterday and
ordered swift action to tackle Britain's gravest
economic crisis since World War 11.
He aimed first at settling the strike of the
nation's 280,000 coal miners so that the country
can get back to full-time work. Other key goals in
his program were arrangements to set up billions of
dollars worth of foreign credit to keep Britain
solvent and steps toward renegotiating terms of
Britain's membership in the European Common
Market.
Brokers, bankers and businessmen appeared

relieved that a phase of uncertainty and instability
now seemed to be ending. Shares on the London
stock market surged forward at the prospect of an
end to the three-day workweek and reopening of
the coal mines. The pound jumped up an initial four
cents to $2.3220, a show of reviving international
confidence.
Meir Continues As Premier
JERUSALEM — Premier Golda Meir announced
yesterday she will serve another term in office and
Moshe Dayan will continue as defense minister in
her next government.
A communique from Meir's office said she would
meet President Ephraim Katzir tomorrow to
announce her decision formally.
The communique said Meir "intends to complete
her efforts concerning the formation of a new
government. The defense minister, Dayan, informed
the prime minister that he is ready to serve in the
next government in his present post."
The dramatic turnabout came at an
extraordinary meeting of the cabinet called to
discuss a security matter. Well-informed sources said
an important development may have cropped up on
the Middle East scene that prompted Dayan to
retract his decision to stay out of the next cabinet.
The official announcement, however, gave no
hint of an impending national emergency. It said
Meir "responded to the Labor party executive's
plea" to remain as head of the government.
Food Giveaway Truck Hijacked
SAN FRANCISCO — A truck laden with free
food to be given to the needy at the demand of
Patricia Hearst's kidnapers was hijacked at gunpoint
yesterday on the way to a distribution center,
marring a handout to more than 30,000 persons.
People in Need organizer A. Ludlow Kramer told
reporters only that guns were involved in the
hijacking of a meat truck. But news sources said
between $34,000 and $60,000 worth of meat,
vegetables and poultry were stolen.
The San Francisco police robbery detail said 12
hours after the stickup that no report had been
made on the heist and police did not intend to press
the matter under order from "high up."
News reports quoted the driver of the truck as
saying the rig, with food enough for 4000 people,
was stopped shortly after 7 a.m. just two blocks
short of the PIN distribution center in San
Francisco's Hunters Point section. The driver, who
was not identified, said he was ordered from the
truck at gunpoint.
Today's Weather

the White House fails to deliver the requested
material on schedule.
"The committee is of a mind to exercise its
power of subpoena if there is a refusal to honor our
request for information," Rodino said at a news
conference after a closed session of the committee.
The issuance of a subpoena could raise a serious
constitutional question if President Nixon invokes
his presidential powers to resist the congressional
power of impeachment.
Rodino said the committee also feels that its
constitutional authority to conduct impeachment
proceedings is sufficient to give it access to the
secret evidence and findings delivered to U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica by the Watergate grand

jury, if it bears on the investigation.
Republican Wins House Race
VENTURA — A Republican bucked a trend of
Democratic Congressional upsets yesterday and
swept to victory in a long-help GOP House seat in
Southern California.
State Senator Robert J. Lagomarsino, 47, of
Ojai, compiled an overwhelming lead over a cluster
of seven Democratic challengers who campaigned on
the Watergate issue in varying degrees.
Of four special Congressional elections held so
far this year, all in previously Republican districts, it
was the first in which a Republican won.
With 407 of 480 precincts reporting,
Lagomarsino had 42,135 to 36,977 for all seven
Democrats combined, a margin of 53 percent. His
nearest rival, James Loebl, had 15,514 votes.
Lagomarsino was the only Republican on the
ballot.
Lagomarsino outdistanced all of his challengers
in California's 13th Congressional District with
more than 50 percent of the vote to win the seat of
the late Rep. Charles M. Teague, a Republican who
represented the district in Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties for 19 years.
The Democrats hoped to consolidate the vote,
partly with the Watergate issue, to force
Lagomarsino into an April 2 runoff. But with his
sweeping victory, Lagomarsino will take his seat in
Washington within a few days.
Democrat Wins Ohio Seat
CINCINNATI, Ohio — Democrat Thomas A.
Luken defeated Republican Willis D. Gradison Jr. in
an Ohio congressional election yesterday.
Republican leaders, some openly and some
privately, blamed Watergate and President Nixon for
the defeat.
Voters in the traditionally Republican Ist
District turned their backs on the Republican
candidate for only the fourth time this century.
In 1972, President Nixon polled 67 percent of
the district's vote, and William J. Keating, whose
resignation created the congressional vacancy,
polled 70 percent.
Wilson Picks Left-Wing Cabinet
LONDON — Prime Minister Harold Wilson chose
a new cabinet with a left-wing look yesterday and
ordered swift action to tackle Britain's gravest
economic crisis since World War 11.
He aimed first at settling the strike of the
nation's 280,000 coal miners so that the country
can get back to full-time work. Other key goals in
his program were arrangements to set up billions of
dollars worth of foreign credit to keep Britain
solvent and steps toward renegotiating terms of
Britain's membership in the European Common
Market.
Brokers, bankers and businessmen appeared

relieved that a phase of uncertainty and instability
now seemed to be ending. Shares on the London
stock market surged forward at the prospect of an
end to the three-day workweek and reopening of
the coal mines. The pound jumped up an initial four
cents to $2.3220, a show of reviving international
confidence.
Meir Continues As Premier
JERUSALEM — Premier Golda Meir announced
yesterday she will serve another term in office and
Moshe Dayan will continue as defense minister in
her next government.
A communique from Meir's office said she would
meet President Ephraim Katzir tomorrow to
announce her decision formally.
The communique said Meir "intends to complete
her efforts concerning the formation of a new
government. The defense minister, Dayan, informed
the prime minister that he is ready to serve in the
next government in his present post."
The dramatic turnabout came at an
extraordinary meeting of the cabinet called to
discuss a security matter. Well-informed sources said
an important development may have cropped up on
the Middle East scene that prompted Dayan to
retract his decision to stay out of the next cabinet.
The official announcement, however, gave no
hint of an impending national emergency. It said
Meir "responded to the Labor party executive's
plea" to remain as head of the government.
Food Giveaway Truck Hijacked
SAN FRANCISCO — A truck laden with free
food to be given to the needy at the demand of
Patricia Hearst's kidnapers was hijacked at gunpoint
yesterday on the way to a distribution center,
marring a handout to more than 30,000 persons.
People in Need organizer A. Ludlow Kramer told
reporters only that guns were involved in the
hijacking of a meat truck. But news sources said
between $34,000 and $60,000 worth of meat,
vegetables and poultry were stolen.
The San Francisco police robbery detail said 12
hours after the stickup that no report had been
made on the heist and police did not intend to press
the matter under order from "high up."
News reports quoted the driver of the truck as
saying the rig, with food enough for 4000 people,
was stopped shortly after 7 a.m. just two blocks
short of the PIN distribution center in San
Francisco's Hunters Point section. The driver, who
was not identified, said he was ordered from the
truck at gunpoint.
Today's Weather
Fair except low clouds in the morning. Increasing
cloudiness this afternoon with chance of rain

Oil Embargo May End Soon
WASHINGTON — Optimism that the Arabs will
/mpletely lift their oil embargo against the United
tates continued here yesterday as Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger briefed President Nixon on
his Middle East trip.
Kissinger spent 45 minutes with Nixon at the
White House. Afterward, Gerald L. Warren, the
deputy press secretary turned aside all questions
with the comment, "the embargo is a matter for the
Arab countries to address."
However, other U.S. officials said any
assumption other than they are hoping for a
removal when the Arab oil ministers meet Sunday in
Libya "would be absurd."
An early end to the Arab oil embargo might ease
the threat of gasoline rationing but would not
necessarily bring a quick return to business as usual.
It probably would take at least a month for
tankers carrying Arab oil to begin reaching the
United States once the embargo is lifted, and it
could be several weeks more before the rate of
imports increased to pre-embargo levels.
Authoritative U.S. sources, hoping that a meeting
of Arab oil ministers scheduled for next Sunday
would bring an end to the embargo, nevertheless
seemed to think it would not lead to unrestrained
production.
Instead, the expectation appeared to lean toward
a return to pre-embargo production levels, requiring
continued U.S. conservation efforts.
Lawyers Request Meeting
WASHINGTON - White House lawyers

committee's request for evidence for its

Yesterday the White House asked for one more

partly with the Watergate issue, to force
Lagomarsino into an April 2 runoff. But with his
sweeping victory, Lagomarsino will take his seat in
Washington within a few days.
Democrat Wins Ohio Seat
CINCINNATI, Ohio — Democrat Thomas A.
Luken defeated Republican Willis D. Gradison Jr. in
an Ohio congressional election yesterday.
Republican leaders, some openly and some
privately, blamed Watergate and President Nixon for
the defeat.
Voters in the traditionally Republican Ist
District turned their backs on the Republican
candidate for only the fourth time this century.
In 1972, President Nixon polled 67 percent of
the district's vote, and William J. Keating, whose
resignation created the congressional vacancy,
polled 70 percent.
Wilson Picks Left-Wing Cabinet
LONDON — Prime Minister Harold Wilson chose
a new cabinet with a left-wing look yesterday and
ordered swift action to tackle Britain's gravest
economic crisis since World War 11.
He aimed first at settling the strike of the
nation's 280,000 coal miners so that the country
can get back to full-time work. Other key goals in
his program were arrangements to set up billions of
dollars worth of foreign credit to keep Britain
solvent and steps toward renegotiating terms of
Britain's membership in the European Common
Market.
Brokers, bankers and businessmen appeared

relieved that a phase of uncertainty and instability
now seemed to be ending. Shares on the London
stock market surged forward at the prospect of an
end to the three-day workweek and reopening of
the coal mines. The pound jumped up an initial four
cents to $2.3220, a show of reviving international
confidence.
Meir Continues As Premier
JERUSALEM — Premier Golda Meir announced
yesterday she will serve another term in office and
Moshe Dayan will continue as defense minister in
her next government.
A communique from Meir's office said she would
meet President Ephraim Katzir tomorrow to
announce her decision formally.
The communique said Meir "intends to complete
her efforts concerning the formation of a new
government. The defense minister, Dayan, informed
the prime minister that he is ready to serve in the
next government in his present post."
The dramatic turnabout came at an
extraordinary meeting of the cabinet called to
discuss a security matter. Well-informed sources said
an important development may have cropped up on
the Middle East scene that prompted Dayan to
retract his decision to stay out of the next cabinet.
The official announcement, however, gave no
hint of an impending national emergency. It said
Meir "responded to the Labor party executive's
plea" to remain as head of the government.
Food Giveaway Truck Hijacked
SAN FRANCISCO — A truck laden with free
food to be given to the needy at the demand of
Patricia Hearst's kidnapers was hijacked at gunpoint
yesterday on the way to a distribution center,
marring a handout to more than 30,000 persons.
People in Need organizer A. Ludlow Kramer told
reporters only that guns were involved in the
hijacking of a meat truck. But news sources said
between $34,000 and $60,000 worth of meat,
vegetables and poultry were stolen.
The San Francisco police robbery detail said 12
hours after the stickup that no report had been
made on the heist and police did not intend to press
the matter under order from "high up."
News reports quoted the driver of the truck as
saying the rig, with food enough for 4000 people,
was stopped shortly after 7 a.m. just two blocks
short of the PIN distribution center in San
Francisco's Hunters Point section. The driver, who
was not identified, said he was ordered from the
truck at gunpoint.
Today's Weather
Fair except low clouds in the morning. Increasing
cloudiness this afternoon with chance of rain
tonight and tomorrow. Cooler tomorrow.
Oil Embargo May End Soon
WASHINGTON — Optimism that the Arabs will
/mpletely lift their oil embargo against the United
tates continued here yesterday as Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger briefed President Nixon on
his Middle East trip.
Kissinger spent 45 minutes with Nixon at the
White House. Afterward, Gerald L. Warren, the
deputy press secretary turned aside all questions
with the comment, "the embargo is a matter for the
Arab countries to address."
However, other U.S. officials said any
assumption other than they are hoping for a
removal when the Arab oil ministers meet Sunday in
Libya "would be absurd."
An early end to the Arab oil embargo might ease
the threat of gasoline rationing but would not
necessarily bring a quick return to business as usual.
It probably would take at least a month for
tankers carrying Arab oil to begin reaching the
United States once the embargo is lifted, and it
could be several weeks more before the rate of
imports increased to pre-embargo levels.
Authoritative U.S. sources, hoping that a meeting
of Arab oil ministers scheduled for next Sunday
would bring an end to the embargo, nevertheless
seemed to think it would not lead to unrestrained
production.
Instead, the expectation appeared to lean toward
a return to pre-embargo production levels, requiring
continued U.S. conservation efforts.
Lawyers Request Meeting
WASHINGTON - White House lawyers
reportedly have asked for a meeting with the House
Judiciary Committee staff to discuss the
committee's request for evidence for its
impeachment inquiry. Committee sources say James
D. St. Clair, in charge of the President's
impeachment defense, asked to meet today with
committee lawyers.
Yesterday the White House asked for one more
day to respond to the committee's request for
evidence for its impeachment inquiry, averting an
immediate resort by the committee to its subpoena
power.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., left little
doubt, however, that a subpoena will be issued if
the White House fails to deliver the requested
material on schedule.
"The committee is of a mind to exercise its
power of subpoena if there is a refusal to honor our
request for information," Rodino said at a news
conference after a closed session of the committee.
The issuance of a subpoena could raise a serious
constitutional question if President Nixon invokes
his presidential powers to resist the congressional
power of impeachment.
Rodino said the committee also feels that its
constitutional authority to conduct impeachment
proceedings is sufficient to give it access to the
secret evidence and findings delivered to U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica by the Watergate grand

jury, if it bears on the investigation.
Republican Wins House Race
VENTURA — A Republican bucked a trend of
Democratic Congressional upsets yesterday and
swept to victory in a long-help GOP House seat in
Southern California.
State Senator Robert J. Lagomarsino, 47, of
Ojai, compiled an overwhelming lead over a cluster
of seven Democratic challengers who campaigned on
the Watergate issue in varying degrees.
Of four special Congressional elections held so
far this year, all in previously Republican districts, it
was the first in which a Republican won.
With 407 of 480 precincts reporting,
Lagomarsino had 42,135 to 36,977 for all seven
Democrats combined, a margin of 53 percent. His
nearest rival, James Loebl, had 15,514 votes.
Lagomarsino was the only Republican on the
ballot.
Lagomarsino outdistanced all of his challengers
in California's 13th Congressional District with
more than 50 percent of the vote to win the seat of
the late Rep. Charles M. Teague, a Republican who
represented the district in Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties for 19 years.
The Democrats hoped to consolidate the vote,
partly with the Watergate issue, to force
Lagomarsino into an April 2 runoff. But with his
sweeping victory, Lagomarsino will take his seat in

meet President Ephraim Katzir tomorrow to
announce her decision formally.
The communique said Meir "intends to complete
her efforts concerning the formation of a new
government. The defense minister, Dayan, informed
the prime minister that he is ready to serve in the
next government in his present post."
The dramatic turnabout came at an
extraordinary meeting of the cabinet called to
discuss a security matter. Well-informed sources said
an important development may have cropped up on
the Middle East scene that prompted Dayan to
retract his decision to stay out of the next cabinet.
The official announcement, however, gave no
hint of an impending national emergency. It said
Meir "responded to the Labor party executive's
plea" to remain as head of the government.
Food Giveaway Truck Hijacked
SAN FRANCISCO — A truck laden with free
food to be given to the needy at the demand of
Patricia Hearst's kidnapers was hijacked at gunpoint
yesterday on the way to a distribution center,
marring a handout to more than 30,000 persons.
People in Need organizer A. Ludlow Kramer told
reporters only that guns were involved in the
hijacking of a meat truck. But news sources said
between $34,000 and $60,000 worth of meat,
vegetables and poultry were stolen.
The San Francisco police robbery detail said 12
hours after the stickup that no report had been
made on the heist and police did not intend to press
the matter under order from "high up."
News reports quoted the driver of the truck as
saying the rig, with food enough for 4000 people,
was stopped shortly after 7 a.m. just two blocks
short of the PIN distribution center in San
Francisco's Hunters Point section. The driver, who
was not identified, said he was ordered from the
truck at gunpoint.
Today's Weather
Fair except low clouds in the morning. Increasing
cloudiness this afternoon with chance of rain
tonight and tomorrow. Cooler tomorrow.
Oil Embargo May End Soon
WASHINGTON — Optimism that the Arabs will
/mpletely lift their oil embargo against the United
tates continued here yesterday as Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger briefed President Nixon on
his Middle East trip.
Kissinger spent 45 minutes with Nixon at the
White House. Afterward, Gerald L. Warren, the
deputy press secretary turned aside all questions
with the comment, "the embargo is a matter for the
Arab countries to address."
However, other U.S. officials said any
assumption other than they are hoping for a
removal when the Arab oil ministers meet Sunday in
Libya "would be absurd."
An early end to the Arab oil embargo might ease
the threat of gasoline rationing but would not
necessarily bring a quick return to business as usual.
It probably would take at least a month for
tankers carrying Arab oil to begin reaching the
United States once the embargo is lifted, and it
could be several weeks more before the rate of
imports increased to pre-embargo levels.
Authoritative U.S. sources, hoping that a meeting
of Arab oil ministers scheduled for next Sunday
would bring an end to the embargo, nevertheless
seemed to think it would not lead to unrestrained
production.
Instead, the expectation appeared to lean toward
a return to pre-embargo production levels, requiring
continued U.S. conservation efforts.
Lawyers Request Meeting
WASHINGTON - White House lawyers
reportedly have asked for a meeting with the House
Judiciary Committee staff to discuss the
committee's request for evidence for its
impeachment inquiry. Committee sources say James
D. St. Clair, in charge of the President's
impeachment defense, asked to meet today with
committee lawyers.
Yesterday the White House asked for one more
day to respond to the committee's request for
evidence for its impeachment inquiry, averting an
immediate resort by the committee to its subpoena
power.
Chairman Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J., left little
doubt, however, that a subpoena will be issued if
the White House fails to deliver the requested
material on schedule.
"The committee is of a mind to exercise its
power of subpoena if there is a refusal to honor our
request for information," Rodino said at a news
conference after a closed session of the committee.
The issuance of a subpoena could raise a serious
constitutional question if President Nixon invokes
his presidential powers to resist the congressional
power of impeachment.
Rodino said the committee also feels that its
constitutional authority to conduct impeachment
proceedings is sufficient to give it access to the
secret evidence and findings delivered to U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica by the Watergate grand

jury, if it bears on the investigation.
Republican Wins House Race
VENTURA — A Republican bucked a trend of
Democratic Congressional upsets yesterday and
swept to victory in a long-help GOP House seat in
Southern California.
State Senator Robert J. Lagomarsino, 47, of
Ojai, compiled an overwhelming lead over a cluster
of seven Democratic challengers who campaigned on
the Watergate issue in varying degrees.
Of four special Congressional elections held so
far this year, all in previously Republican districts, it
was the first in which a Republican won.
With 407 of 480 precincts reporting,
Lagomarsino had 42,135 to 36,977 for all seven
Democrats combined, a margin of 53 percent. His
nearest rival, James Loebl, had 15,514 votes.
Lagomarsino was the only Republican on the
ballot.
Lagomarsino outdistanced all of his challengers
in California's 13th Congressional District with
more than 50 percent of the vote to win the seat of
the late Rep. Charles M. Teague, a Republican who
represented the district in Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties for 19 years.
The Democrats hoped to consolidate the vote,
partly with the Watergate issue, to force
Lagomarsino into an April 2 runoff. But with his
sweeping victory, Lagomarsino will take his seat in
Washington within a few days.
Democrat Wins Ohio Seat
CINCINNATI, Ohio — Democrat Thomas A.
Luken defeated Republican Willis D. Gradison Jr. in
an Ohio congressional election yesterday.
Republican leaders, some openly and some
privately, blamed Watergate and President Nixon for
the defeat.
Voters in the traditionally Republican Ist
District turned their backs on the Republican
candidate for only the fourth time this century.
In 1972, President Nixon polled 67 percent of
the district's vote, and William J. Keating, whose
resignation created the congressional vacancy,
polled 70 percent.
Wilson Picks Left-Wing Cabinet
LONDON — Prime Minister Harold Wilson chose
a new cabinet with a left-wing look yesterday and
ordered swift action to tackle Britain's gravest
economic crisis since World War 11.
He aimed first at settling the strike of the
nation's 280,000 coal miners so that the country
can get back to full-time work. Other key goals in
his program were arrangements to set up billions of
dollars worth of foreign credit to keep Britain
solvent and steps toward renegotiating terms of
Britain's membership in the European Common
Market.
Brokers, bankers and businessmen appeared

relieved that a phase of uncertainty and instability
now seemed to be ending. Shares on the London
stock market surged forward at the prospect of an
end to the three-day workweek and reopening of
the coal mines. The pound jumped up an initial four
cents to $2.3220, a show of reviving international
confidence.
Meir Continues As Premier
JERUSALEM — Premier Golda Meir announced
yesterday she will serve another term in office and
Moshe Dayan will continue as defense minister in
her next government.
A communique from Meir's office said she would
meet President Ephraim Katzir tomorrow to
announce her decision formally.
The communique said Meir "intends to complete
her efforts concerning the formation of a new
