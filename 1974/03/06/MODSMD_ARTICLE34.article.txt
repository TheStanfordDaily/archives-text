# Information Access Debated By Senate
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
The ASSU Senate last night
debated the recommendations of a
special committee urging changes in
the selection and supervision of
student members of University
committees.
Debate centered on the proposal
that the information given to President
Richard Lyman for consideration of
student nominees on residential
advisory committees be limited to
matters of "public information."
Name, address, telephone number,
class and past committee experience
constitute public information.
Lyman has requested that he also
see a statement of qualifications for

each prospective committee member.
The President's Office is holding up
the confirmation of four nominees
pending the outcome of discussion
with the ASSU Senate and the Council
of Presidents.
Student members of presidential
committees which are nominated by
the ASSU Nominations Committee,
are confirmed by the student senate
and by Lyman.
Asst. to the Dean of Student
Affairs Dale Snape explained Lyman
doesn't want to accept a "blank slate"
when he considers student nominees.
Snape said Lyman wants to make sure
nominees really want to serve on the
committees for which they're
nominated, but "he doesn't want to
meddle in their politics."
Many senators, including Mike
Amylon, disagreed with Snape.
"Lyman has no right to know
anything about students on
committees except that they've been
nominated. It's our job to see the
student representatives do a good job,
not Lyman's," Amylon said.
ASSU Vice President Beth Garfield
said that she did not want Lyman to
reject nominees because of
information in their applications.
However, she said, Lyman has not
rejected nominees in the past.
Garfield said that Lyman's request
for a report on sex and racial makeup
of the applicant pool was "ridiculous."
She claimed there was a scarcity of
this information on sex and racial
makeup of University committees
which students do not serve on.
Garfield urged the Senate to take
action on the proposal as soon as
possible because the President's office
decision to hold up four nominees.
The Senate, however, postponed
action on the proposal so its members
can study the matter further.
The special Senate committee also
recommended that a procedure be
developed for removing student
members of University committees
who don't attend meetings or perform
their duties poorly.
There is presently no way to
remove a student if he consistently
misses meetings.
The special committee also
recommended that the ASSU Senate
elections be held in the second week
of spring quarter. Senate elections now
are held in autumn quarter.

their duties poorly.
There is presently no way to
remove a student if he consistently
misses meetings.
The special committee also
recommended that the ASSU Senate
elections be held in the second week
of spring quarter. Senate elections now
are held in autumn quarter.
The ASSU Senate last night
debated the recommendations of a
special committee urging changes in
the selection and supervision of
student members of University
committees.
Debate centered on the proposal
that the information given to President
Richard Lyman for consideration of
student nominees on residential
advisory committees be limited to
matters of "public information."
Name, address, telephone number,
class and past committee experience
constitute public information.
Lyman has requested that he also
see a statement of qualifications for

each prospective committee member.
The President's Office is holding up
the confirmation of four nominees
pending the outcome of discussion
with the ASSU Senate and the Council
of Presidents.
Student members of presidential
committees which are nominated by
the ASSU Nominations Committee,
are confirmed by the student senate
and by Lyman.
Asst. to the Dean of Student
Affairs Dale Snape explained Lyman
doesn't want to accept a "blank slate"
when he considers student nominees.
Snape said Lyman wants to make sure
nominees really want to serve on the
committees for which they're
nominated, but "he doesn't want to
meddle in their politics."
Many senators, including Mike
Amylon, disagreed with Snape.
"Lyman has no right to know
anything about students on
committees except that they've been
nominated. It's our job to see the
student representatives do a good job,
not Lyman's," Amylon said.
ASSU Vice President Beth Garfield
said that she did not want Lyman to
reject nominees because of
information in their applications.
However, she said, Lyman has not
rejected nominees in the past.
Garfield said that Lyman's request
for a report on sex and racial makeup
of the applicant pool was "ridiculous."
She claimed there was a scarcity of
this information on sex and racial
makeup of University committees
which students do not serve on.
Garfield urged the Senate to take
action on the proposal as soon as
possible because the President's office
decision to hold up four nominees.
The Senate, however, postponed
action on the proposal so its members
can study the matter further.
The special Senate committee also
recommended that a procedure be
developed for removing student
members of University committees
who don't attend meetings or perform
their duties poorly.
