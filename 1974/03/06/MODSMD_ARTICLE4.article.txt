# Frenchman's Terrace
## Occupancy Issue Splits P.A. City Council 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Members of the Palo Alto City
Council disagree on whether the
University should be allowed to
allocate half of the units in the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project to its own employees.
James Price, area director of the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), announced last
week he may oppose occupancy
priority to members of the Stanford
community.
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225-unit
project, would be built on University
land with funds from HUD. The
University has asked Palo Alto to
annex the area and provide municipal
services for the project.
Vice Mayor Enid Pearson expressed
her agreement with Price. "I have
opposed quotas since the beginning of
the planning for the project," Pearson
declared. "There is no reason why the
project can't be open to the general
community."
Robert Augsburger, University vice

president for business and finance,
holds that since the University would
make the land available for the
project, it should have the right to
allocate half of the units to Stanford
employees.
One-fourth of the units would be
allocated to employees of companies
located on land belonging to the
University, he said. One fourth would
be open to the general public, he
added.
"Many Stanford employees need
housing that is close to campus,"
Augsburger stated. "The project is
being built to accommodate them, and I
don't believe that it is unreasonable to
promise them special priority."
On the other hand, Councilman
Richard Rosenbaum stated that there
should be no occupancy restrictions,
since Frenchman's Terrace is being
built with federal money.
"I have always objected to these
Restrictions," Rosenbaum said. "They
are unfair. Federal money is derived
from the taxpayers and everyone

should be allowed to benefit from it."
Rosenbaum claimed that the
University originally hadn't intended
to allow even one fourth of the units
to be open to the general public.
"That was a concession to Palo Alto by
the University," he stated.
Rosenbaum also expressed
disapproval of the plans to include 225
units in the project.
There would be more open space if
all the market price units were
eliminated, leaving only 180 low
income units, he said.
Councilman Roy Clay disagreed with
Rosenbaum. "People of different
incomes should be mixed together in
Frenchman's Terrace," he said. "The
only thing that separates them is their
income, not their character."
Clay said that he supports the
occupancy restrictions because they
insure that people will be allowed to
live near their places of work.
As for annexing the Terrace to Palo
Alto, most city council members took
a "wait and see" attitude.

Vice Pearson insisted that among
other things, she is hesitant to vote for
annexation because the project might
add to the traffic problems of nearby
College Terrace.
But Clay contended that
construction of the project might
actually reduce traffic in the College
Terrace area.
He explained that many of the
commuters who now use College
Terrace as a thorough way would move
to Frenchman's Terrace, and therefore
no longer would pass through College
Terrace on their way to work.
Pearson also contended that
Frenchman's Terrace as presently
planned would be an unpleasant, noisy
place for people to live because the
units are not set back far enough from
the road.
Rosenbaum disagreed, pointing out
the project would be constructed 65
feet from the road and would
probably be blocked off by a high
masonry wall.
