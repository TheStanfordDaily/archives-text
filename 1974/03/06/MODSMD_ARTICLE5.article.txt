# Promoter Of 'Topless' Entertains Class
## 
### GEORGE TIBBITS 
Normally, the speakers who address Prof. William
River's class in "Problems of the Mass Media" are
people distinguished in the field of communication
— Fred Friendly, Howard Simons, Hilda
Himmelweit — well respected researchers and
journalists.
Yesterday's speaker, Davey Rosenberg, is also
respected, but not exactly in the same way.
Rosenberg, 37, is considered one of the top
promoters in the country. Specifically, he promotes
breasts — female breasts, or more accurately,
glimpses of breasts belonging to dancers who work
in the North Beach clubs in San Francisco.
Rosenberg modestly bills himself "the world's
greatest press agent," and handles publicity for the
Condor, El Cid, Big Al's, and other Broadway Strip
nightspots. "I personally am responsible for the
name 'topless entertainment,'" he once told a
Playboy interviewer. "I personally put 'topless' in
the dictionary."
Streaking Incident
One-half hour before speaking to the
communication class, Rosenberg staged a
"streaking" incident outside of Redwood Hall with
female impersonator Lee Garland and dancers Chip
Lopez and Cindy Francis, all from El Cid.
Garland, dressed in his "Mae West" outfit —
padded white satin evening gown, diamond bodice
and ostrich feather headpiece — stood a few feet in

front of Rosenberg's car with Lopez behind him,
holding Garland's ermine and diamond stole.
Francis took off her blouse and knelt a few feet
away. Rosenberg then gathered a crowd to watch
and had his cameraman take pictures.
•Cut It Off'
"The only place where entertainment is being
censored is where alcohol is being served," referring
to the state law prohibiting bottomless performers
in clubs selling liquor. "We're still allowed to show
the upper part of the female body or the male, but
bottomless — we have to just cut if off."
In San Francisco, he said, "We can't use words
like 'nude,' 'bottomless,' 'naked' or anything that
implies bareness on signs [outside the nightclubs]."
He pointed out that while an art gallery can display
a nude in its window and can use the word nude to
advertise a show, a nightclub cannot.
He also complained that movies such as The
Exorcist are shown with only an "R" rating, while
clubs have restrictions on semi-nude performers. "If
anything is done in bad taste, that is," he said. "The
garbage pit is Hollywood."
Criticism
Rosenberg was vehement in his criticism of
Nixon and Watergate. "What's taken place in the
last year in this country is unbelievable," he said.
"If this were Mexico, we wouldn't have to worry
now."
He criticized the American Medical Association
for being opposed to acupuncture, claimed the big

oil companies were to blame for the fuel shortage,
and criticized the American Bar Association for
suspending Melvin Belli.
After Rosenberg finished, he introduced one
dancer, Lopez, who was now wearing a sailor suit.
To a tape of Bette Mitler singing "In the Mood,"
Lopez began tap dancing in a cleared-off area in the
center of the room.
Lopez, who recently quit El Cid to enter the
Academy of Art in San Francisco to study
advertising and education, did an imitation of Gene
Kelly, and received a strong round of applause.
Rosenberg then introduced the "star of the
show," Lee Garland. "This is what's called a female
impersonator," he said. "I don't think a female
impersonator has ever appeared at a university."
Mae West
Garland, now completely in his Mae West role,
sedately strolled into the room and picked up a
microphone. He cracked a few jokes ("I have a role
in a new movie. I come down the stairs wearing a
two-piece costume — gloves."), then swung into a
rendition of "Frankie and Johnnie."
"I feel like Virginia Mayo when she was working
her way through college," he said between verses.
After the song, Garland answered a few questions
about his profession. His best impersonation, he
said, was Judy Garland. "Out of drag, I look like
Liza Minelli," he said. "In drag, I look like Judy
Garland."

Rosenberg was vehement in his criticism of
Nixon and Watergate. "What's taken place in the
last year in this country is unbelievable," he said.
"If this were Mexico, we wouldn't have to worry
now."
He criticized the American Medical Association
for being opposed to acupuncture, claimed the big

oil companies were to blame for the fuel shortage,
and criticized the American Bar Association for
suspending Melvin Belli.
After Rosenberg finished, he introduced one
dancer, Lopez, who was now wearing a sailor suit.
To a tape of Bette Mitler singing "In the Mood,"
Lopez began tap dancing in a cleared-off area in the
center of the room.
Lopez, who recently quit El Cid to enter the
Academy of Art in San Francisco to study
advertising and education, did an imitation of Gene
Kelly, and received a strong round of applause.
Rosenberg then introduced the "star of the
show," Lee Garland. "This is what's called a female
impersonator," he said. "I don't think a female
impersonator has ever appeared at a university."
Mae West
Garland, now completely in his Mae West role,
sedately strolled into the room and picked up a
microphone. He cracked a few jokes ("I have a role
in a new movie. I come down the stairs wearing a
two-piece costume — gloves."), then swung into a
rendition of "Frankie and Johnnie."
"I feel like Virginia Mayo when she was working
her way through college," he said between verses.
After the song, Garland answered a few questions
about his profession. His best impersonation, he
said, was Judy Garland. "Out of drag, I look like
Liza Minelli," he said. "In drag, I look like Judy
Garland."

MAE WEST? - No, female inpersonator Lee Garland who, along with night club
promotor Davey Rosenberg, entertained students of Prof. William Rivers'
communication class, "Problems of the Mass Media" yesterday.
Normally, the speakers who address Prof. William
River's class in "Problems of the Mass Media" are
people distinguished in the field of communication
— Fred Friendly, Howard Simons, Hilda
Himmelweit — well respected researchers and
journalists.
Yesterday's speaker, Davey Rosenberg, is also
respected, but not exactly in the same way.
Rosenberg, 37, is considered one of the top
promoters in the country. Specifically, he promotes
breasts — female breasts, or more accurately,
glimpses of breasts belonging to dancers who work
in the North Beach clubs in San Francisco.
Rosenberg modestly bills himself "the world's
greatest press agent," and handles publicity for the
Condor, El Cid, Big Al's, and other Broadway Strip
nightspots. "I personally am responsible for the
name 'topless entertainment,'" he once told a
Playboy interviewer. "I personally put 'topless' in
the dictionary."
Streaking Incident
One-half hour before speaking to the
communication class, Rosenberg staged a
"streaking" incident outside of Redwood Hall with
female impersonator Lee Garland and dancers Chip
Lopez and Cindy Francis, all from El Cid.
Garland, dressed in his "Mae West" outfit —
padded white satin evening gown, diamond bodice
and ostrich feather headpiece — stood a few feet in

front of Rosenberg's car with Lopez behind him,
holding Garland's ermine and diamond stole.
Francis took off her blouse and knelt a few feet
away. Rosenberg then gathered a crowd to watch
and had his cameraman take pictures.
•Cut It Off'
"The only place where entertainment is being
censored is where alcohol is being served," referring
to the state law prohibiting bottomless performers
in clubs selling liquor. "We're still allowed to show
the upper part of the female body or the male, but
bottomless — we have to just cut if off."
In San Francisco, he said, "We can't use words
like 'nude,' 'bottomless,' 'naked' or anything that
implies bareness on signs [outside the nightclubs]."
He pointed out that while an art gallery can display
a nude in its window and can use the word nude to
advertise a show, a nightclub cannot.
He also complained that movies such as The
Exorcist are shown with only an "R" rating, while
clubs have restrictions on semi-nude performers. "If
anything is done in bad taste, that is," he said. "The
garbage pit is Hollywood."
Criticism
Rosenberg was vehement in his criticism of
Nixon and Watergate. "What's taken place in the
last year in this country is unbelievable," he said.
"If this were Mexico, we wouldn't have to worry
now."
