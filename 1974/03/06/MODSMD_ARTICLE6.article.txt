# Wascher Wrong

Ch ris Murray

In the Feb. 26 Daily, Jim
Wascher unleashed in his article
"Chris Murray and Student
Power" what can only be
considered a personal attack. The
article was reminiscent of his
earlier article cutting ASSU
Vice President Jim Friend,
entitled "Friend: Too Little, Too
Late." His Feb. 26 article was
lacking in fact as much as it was in
objectivity.
During the summer of 1973 I
conferred with a number of
members of the ASUCLA at the
University of California in Los
Angeles. I took time to review the
student government situation at
USC, which disbanded its system
in 1969 but was just beginning to
set-up a new system for this
academic year. I talked with a
number of students from San
Jose, UC Berkeley, Princeton, and
Harvard, and tried to get a feel for
what was happening on these
campuses.
I also did some research on the
government system of an eastern
school which most resembles
Stanford, Cornell University. The
general impression that I was
given was that student apathy was
at an all-time high, and that there
was a great deal of
experimentation going on with
regard to student government
structuring.
ASSA Guidelines
If- Wascher had taken the time
to look in the Student Activities
guide published by the ASSU for
1973-74, he would have found the
guidelines I laid down for the
Associated Stanford Students for
Action (ASSA) in October: "This
is an organization bent on finding
ways to upgrade and effectively
strengthen college student
governance."
The more complete version
given to every ASSU Senator Oct.
29, went on to say, "This
organization's purpose will be to
gather ideas, initiatives, and
innovations for the consideration
of the ASSU and College Student
Governments in general across the
country."

However, like most of the 100
other organizations on campus,
the ASSA had to consider
available financial resources and
general student apathy. Both have
proved formidable problems for
the ASSA. Presently with a
membership of 27, and
insufficient funding, the ASSA is
inoperative as an organization.
Snape Concerned
During a meeting Jan. 26,
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Dale Snape and I discussed the
problem. At that time Dale
expressed his concern over the
possibility of the ASSA becoming
"partisan prior to the ASSU
Spring Elections," and over my
"high visibility."
At that time we agreed that
any "serious consideration" of
funding the ASSA would have to
come about "after the elections."
Feb. 15, I received a letter from
the Dean of Student Affairs
Office inviting me to apply for the
Spring fee assessment.
Wascher has accused me of
"merely using the ASSA to
further [my] own political
ambitions;" I would very blandly
tell him to go home and look in
the mirror. As of late he has taken
to the practice of cutting into the
most visible student leaders on
campus, merely for the purpose of
getting cheap publicity.
General Rule
I broke a general personal rule
here and engaged in personalities;
as this is the first time, I intend to
make it the last. I'm willing to
talk about problems facing our
University, all of us as humans,
and the world, but not those of
Jim Wascher's.
As for "Student Power" — if
wishing to give Stanford students
more voice in the decision-making
process is a crime, then I plead
guilty. If wanting a more
effective, more workable, student
government puts me on Jim
Wascher's enemies list, or that of
the Faculty or Administration —
what can I say but that I'm sorry?
