# 'White Terror'?

"Investigators say that
members of Venceremos have
divided themselves into small,
terrorist groups spread across the
country.' "
"Sources say Venceremos was
allied with gangs dealing in
homosexual prostitution and the
rackets, based in the L.A. and
Central valley areas â€” 'Plums the
revolutionaries are anxious to
pick,' as they put it."
"Correction officials say they
intercepted a magazine letter in
which radicals advocated
chopping off the heads of children
and leaving them in front of
prison gates."
"Investigators say that
ex-Venceremos members are 'as
dangerous as the most viscious
guerillas in history' [emphasis
added in all cases]
These statements were some of
many made by anonymous police
sources that were published in
California papers, including the
Palo Alto Times. They appeared
one week after the prosecution of
two ex-Venceremos members
began in San Bernardino.
Daily Follows Suit
Now the Daily has followed
suit. Glenn Garvin, ex-editor of
the Arena, and Kevin Smith have
written a two part series on
Venceremos and the SLA in
which every quoted statement,
with the exception of Bruce
Franklin's, is based on anonymous
police sources. "Officials say,"
"authorities believe,"
"radical-watchers advise" goes the
article.
It is not Garvin's or Smith's

journalism that bothers us, but
the barrage of police quotes
hitting the press. The police knew
exactly what the Venceremos
organization's politics were. We
were very open about them.
We think, in fact, there could
be a purpose to their statements.
They could be paving the way for
a roundup of radicals, not only
those they think are connected
with the SLA, but any open,
active revolutionaries, both in and
out of prison they'd like an
excuse to get at.
'White Terror'
We believe further, this "white
terror" might not be the old,
open, massive shoot-outs used
against the Black Panthers.
Instead, they're obtaining
convictions of revolutionaries,
especially those connected with
the prison movement, based on
her/his politics rather than
evidence. As one juror in the
Chino Trial of two revolutionaries
later commented, "the defendants
were capable of committing the
act, therefore probably did."
All of this points up the
dangers of the SLA's
"adventurism." Not only are
individual acts of kidnap and
assassination futile in bringing
about revolution, but they are
used as an excuse by the
government to try and tighten its
reigns further.
