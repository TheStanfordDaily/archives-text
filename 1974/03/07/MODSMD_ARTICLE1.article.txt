## Equipment: How Not To Get Burned 
### RANDY BAKER 
Buying a stereo system is not
easy. The prospective buyer is
faced with dozens of stereo stores,
dozens of stereo brands, each
claiming to be the best. It is easy
to be confused, easy to be misled,
easy to be ripped off unless you
know exactly what you're doing.
The first rule of stereo buying
is to learn about equipment. This
can be done with the aid of hi-fi
magazines and consumer
magazines. Also, one should not
underestimate the value of
friends' advice.
The second rule of stereo

buying is to find a dealer with
whom you are comfortable. Don't
be afraid to shop around; it can
often save you large amounts of
money. But try to find a store
with:
—courteous salespeople —
people who will answer your
questions and, rather than
pressuring you, will help you find
the system best for you;
—a good service department;
—a wide selection of brands.
The third rule of stereo buying
is to set a price. It is probably
impossible nowadays to buy a
good-quality system for under

$300. Face up to this, and then
try to decide how much more you
are willing to spend.
At the heart of any stereo
system is the receiver. This unit
consists of an amplifier, pre-amp,
and radio tuner. While some
purists may argue that these
components should be bought
separately, receivers are now
widely accepted. Buying a receiver
is both more common and less
expensive than buying the
separate components.
Match Components
When shopping for a receiver,
be sure to match it with the

speakers you plan to get. Also,
don't be fooled by the number of
controls and dials; often they are
there only to catch your eye.
Don't be fooled by the various
power ratings; they can be quite
deceptive. RMS power is an
industry-wide standard and the
most reliable measure.
Among the most popular
receiver brands are Pioneer,
Sherwood, Sony and Marantz.
They will all give you good value
for your money.
Check Speaker Efficiency
In choosing speakers, take care

to match them to your receiver.
The more efficient a speaker is,
the less power it takes to drive it.
Thus, ten watts put into a highly
efficient speaker may fill a room,
whereas ten watts put into a
speaker of low efficiency might
hardly produce a whisper. You
should also make sure that your
speakers can handle at least ten
percent more wattage then your
amp can put out, to avoid damage
to the speakers.
Other than these technical
guidelines, the only way to truly

judge a speaker is to listen to it. It
is purely a matter of personal
taste. You might like one
company's $50 speaker better
than another company's $150
speaker.
Reputable manufacturers of
speakers include Altec, JBL,
Advent, Marantz, KLH and
AR.
When buying a turntable, try
to avoid the lower priced Garrard
and BSR models if at all possible.
Although these are the most
popular, they are not very good.
A truly good turntable/changer
costs at least $100. Among the

better brands in this price range
are Dual, Garrard, BSR and AR. If
you wish to save some money,
and are willing to forego the
convenience of an automatic
changer, the AR Model XA
manual turntable is an excellent
buy.
Cassette vs. Reel-to-Reel Tape
You may also wish to add a
tape deck to your system.
Reel-to-reel tape has long been
considered by audiophiles to be
the ultimate in high fidelity
sound. However, with the advent
of the Dolby noise reduction
system, the sound of cassettes is
virtually as good as that of
reel-to-reel. Cassettes are both
more convenient and less
expensive than reel-to-reel. Some
of the best manufacturers of tape
machines are Teac, Revox, Sony
and Tandberg. Avoid 8-track
systems; both reel-to-reel and
cassettes are far superior.
A final thing you may wish to
consider is the purchase of
headphones. They offer the twin
advantages of not disturbing
roommates and giving fine sound
cheaply. A good pair of
stereophones can give you fidelity
approaching that of the best
speakers, and for only $40!
Among the most popular
stereophone models are the Koss
Pro 4AA, the Sennheiser HD 414
and the Superex ST PRO-BV. Of
course, like speakers, the selection
of headphones should be a matter
of personal taste.
Of course, once you have spent
several hundred dollars on a
receiver, speakers, turntable, tape
machine, and headphones, you
will still have to select the most
important component of all: the
music.
