# FM Faces Social Changes; Open Programs Questioned
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
FM radio originally attracted its listeners by
providing better fidelity and playing the music its
audience wanted to hear. But now, according to
afficials at several Bay Area FM stations, the new
medium of the mid-1960s has gained greater
acceptance, so FM stations must now be more
concerned with laying claim to a niche in the
existing market.
This concern with staking a claim to a certain
part of the FM audience has lead many stations to
become more standardized or organized, depending
on one's frame of reference.
During fall quarter, KZSU-FM changed to a
more organized format, with disc jockeys required
to play cuts from best-selling albums. This move
away from a more free-form format caused some
people to question if the move was in the best
interests of the primarily Stanford audience.

Free-Form Days Gone?
This question of standardized/organized
programming versus no play list and free form
programming has given news and program directors
of other Bay Area stations some food for thought,
too. Employees of three FM stations each had
somewhat differing opinions about the future
direction of FM radio, but all agreed that the 1960s
are definitely over, and stations had to become
more organized to generate enough income to
continue in the 19705.
But there is still room at the other end of the
spectrum for a totally volunteer,
community-oriented non-commercial radio station,
where people and ideas literally walk in off the
street.
KPOO-FM In San Francisco is that freest form
of station, supported and programmed by listeners
