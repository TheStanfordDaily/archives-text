# FM Faces Social Changes; Open Programs Questioned
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
FM radio originally attracted its listeners by
providing better fidelity and playing the music its
audience wanted to hear. But now, according to
afficials at several Bay Area FM stations, the new
medium of the mid-1960s has gained greater
acceptance, so FM stations must now be more
concerned with laying claim to a niche in the
existing market.
This concern with staking a claim to a certain
part of the FM audience has lead many stations to
become more standardized or organized, depending
on one's frame of reference.
During fall quarter, KZSU-FM changed to a
more organized format, with disc jockeys required
to play cuts from best-selling albums. This move
away from a more free-form format caused some
people to question if the move was in the best
interests of the primarily Stanford audience.

Free-Form Days Gone?
This question of standardized/organized
programming versus no play list and free form
programming has given news and program directors
of other Bay Area stations some food for thought,
too. Employees of three FM stations each had
somewhat differing opinions about the future
direction of FM radio, but all agreed that the 1960s
are definitely over, and stations had to become
more organized to generate enough income to
continue in the 19705.
But there is still room at the other end of the
spectrum for a totally volunteer,
community-oriented non-commercial radio station,
where people and ideas literally walk in off the
street.
KPOO-FM In San Francisco is that freest form
of station, supported and programmed by listeners


WHICH ONE? â€” A sound equipment shopper is faced with an array of

24 hours a day. According to Sue Rice, who works
in the station's news department, the cost of
keeping KPOO on the air averages from $30 to $40
a day. This money is raised from listeners through
donations and enables the station to "program the
unprogrammable," Rice said.
'Alternative Radio'
Although she thinks the term "alternative radio"
has become a cliche just as stale as the
"underground press," Rice can't think of any
better way to describe the "total free-form" format
of the station.
But even this 250-watt station, which has only
been on the air since last June 6, does have some
scheduling necessities. Broadcasting many meetings
of San Francisco's local governing bodies live does
put a bit of rigidity into the station's operation.
Basically, though, KPOO remains totally dependent
on its "from two to 2,000 listeners" for every facet
of its existence, from money to staff.
Such is not the case for two FM giants, KSAN in
San Francisco and KSJO in San Jose. These
stations' advertising revenue has shown
improvement, as has most FM ad income
throughout the country.
But KSAN Program Director Tom O'Hare does
not feel that advertisers have gained inordinate
control over programming decisions on his station.
Social Changes
A broadening of advertisers and products
offered over the FM airwaves shows the station is
"responsible to social pressures," O'Hare said.
People were tired of "lying around their pad,
thinking the revolution was going to come after the
next joint." All the talk about the immediacy of
some fundamental changes in society "proved to be

turkey turds," O'Hare stated.
Since many of KSAN's listeners have decided to
go out and get a piece of the materialistic society,
KSAN has to keep appealing to listeners by
advertising a broader range of products. The
station, however, is still walking the delicate line
between organization and standardization.
KSAN does have organization, but operates with
no play list for disc jockeys, with certain popular
programs scheduled at regular times. According to
O'Hare, this format is "the freest you're going to
get." The station is a money-maker, and as long as
that continues, KSAN gets no hassles from
Metromedia, the parent company.
Playing To Audience
News director Dana Jang of KSJO-FM in San
Jose echoed many of O'Hare's sentiments, but
didn't seem as defensive as O'Hare about changing
expectations of the 18 to 34-year-old audience.
"People got tired of a loaded-sounding disc
jockey letting a record track," he said. Instead,
Jang felt that FM audiences today want station
personnel to show they "have an audience in
mind," therefore there's a trend to more
"organized" programming. What the audience
wants to hear is determined at KSJO by rating
surveys, record sales, phone conversations with
listeners and attendence at musical events, Jang
stated.
Jang also expressed a strong belief in the
continuing place of community-oriented, free-form
staions like KPOO and KKUP-FM in Cupertino,
which he helped organize. But on balance, the rest
of the 1970s will probably see a variety of stations
offering a wide range of programs, with more
organization (but not necessarily standardization)
of program material.
