# K- 101 To Test 'Quad' FM
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Not long after quadrophonic
recording and playback
techniques made the news in the
sound industry, someone got the
idea of four-channel FM radio
broadcasting. Among those who
became interested in the problem
was James Gabbert, a former
Stanford student who founded
and now owns K-101 in San
Francisco.
The National Quadrophonic
Radio Commission (NQRC), set
up to investigate and evaluate
proposed quad broadcast systems,
has selected K-101 as the national
test station for the most
promising setups.
When speaking of quad
broadcasting. Gabbert makes it
clear that he means discrete
four-channel sound. (For an
explanation of quad systems, see
related story on page 8.) Disrete
quad broadcast is a 4-4-4 system
(four channels recorded, four
broadcast, four received) as
opposed to a matrix or 4-2-4
process with a decoder in the
receiver.
Split Signal
Gabbert explains that stereo
broadcasting involves a normal
FM signal which alternates
between two channels at a
frequency of 38 KHz. The two
channels are heard as continuous
sound, just like a motion picture
camera creates a seemingly
continuous image.
In order to get four channels, a
station merely has to split once
again, to a frequency of 76 KHz,

and a quad receiver will receive
four-channel sound. This process,
known as the Dorren system, is
the simplest and most logical
choice, according to Gabbert. He
added that a nearly identical
system has been proposed by GE,
because "this is the way to do it —
Dorren just thought of it first."
The cost of conversion to the
Dorren 4-4-4 system would be
minimal, according to Gabbert.
"We're talking about $500 to
$2000 for an average station," he
said.
Field Testing Soon
Under NQRC supervision,
K-101 will conduct field tests of
the Dorren system in its present

form beginning in April or May,
said Gabbert. Tests will include
signal separation, reception in
moving vehicles and other
measures similar to those used to
evaluate experiments in stereo
broadcasting several years ago.
Gabbert is enthusiastic about
the prospects of quad sound and
quad broadcasting, especially its
ability to totally involve the
listener in the sound as stereo
cannot. He emphasized that quad
broadcasts would be perfectly
compatible with existing
monaural or stereo systems, just
as stereo FM works well on mono
receivers.

the simplest and most logical
choice, according to Gabbert. He
added that a nearly identical
system has been proposed by GE,
because "this is the way to do it —
Dorren just thought of it first."
The cost of conversion to the
Dorren 4-4-4 system would be
minimal, according to Gabbert.
"We're talking about $500 to
$2000 for an average station," he
said.
Field Testing Soon
Under NQRC supervision,
K-101 will conduct field tests of
the Dorren system in its present

form beginning in April or May,
said Gabbert. Tests will include
signal separation, reception in
moving vehicles and other
measures similar to those used to
evaluate experiments in stereo
broadcasting several years ago.
Gabbert is enthusiastic about
the prospects of quad sound and
quad broadcasting, especially its
ability to totally involve the
listener in the sound as stereo
cannot. He emphasized that quad
broadcasts would be perfectly
compatible with existing
monaural or stereo systems, just
as stereo FM works well on mono
receivers.
Not long after quadrophonic
recording and playback
techniques made the news in the
sound industry, someone got the
idea of four-channel FM radio
broadcasting. Among those who
became interested in the problem
was James Gabbert, a former
Stanford student who founded
and now owns K-101 in San
Francisco.
The National Quadrophonic
Radio Commission (NQRC), set
up to investigate and evaluate
proposed quad broadcast systems,
has selected K-101 as the national
test station for the most
promising setups.
When speaking of quad
broadcasting. Gabbert makes it
clear that he means discrete
four-channel sound. (For an
explanation of quad systems, see
related story on page 8.) Disrete
quad broadcast is a 4-4-4 system
(four channels recorded, four
broadcast, four received) as
opposed to a matrix or 4-2-4
process with a decoder in the
receiver.
Split Signal
Gabbert explains that stereo
broadcasting involves a normal
FM signal which alternates
between two channels at a
frequency of 38 KHz. The two
channels are heard as continuous
sound, just like a motion picture
camera creates a seemingly
continuous image.
In order to get four channels, a
station merely has to split once
again, to a frequency of 76 KHz,

and a quad receiver will receive
four-channel sound. This process,
known as the Dorren system, is
the simplest and most logical
choice, according to Gabbert. He
added that a nearly identical
system has been proposed by GE,
because "this is the way to do it —
Dorren just thought of it first."
The cost of conversion to the
Dorren 4-4-4 system would be
minimal, according to Gabbert.
