# Once Around The Turntable
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN DOUG SMITH JAY HARLOW DAN FORTE 
Perhaps the best thing that can
be said for Jesse Colin Young's
Song For Juli is that it brings him
another step closer to establishing
himself as one of the truly fine
individual performers in
country-rock music.
The album is pleasant,
enjoyable, tuneful, but far from
perfect. Although Young and the
other musicians deliver generally
fine music, the album suffers from
occasional lapses in creativity.
Even so. Young's style at
several points in the album can be
very favorably compared to James
Taylor. The former's music is
keenly individual, peaceful,
mellow and the album provides
the same balance between slow,
melodious cuts and upbeat,
jazz-oriented songs as the latter's
Sweet Baby James.
Young, too, seems enchanted
with strong horn backgrounds and
adds them liberally throughout
the disc. The trumpets, saxes and
trombones add a great deal to the
album, but are especially fine in
setting the backdrops for some
beautiful music in "Country
Home" and "Morning Sun."
Tempo Changes
Tempos change widely and
often in Young's music. For
example, in "Miss Hesitation," the
music starts with a brisk 4/4,
changes to a smooth waltz,
switches back to 4/4, waltz and
finally slides into a good
old-fashioned dixieland feel.
While the tempo changes are
exciting and well-executed, Jesse
Colin Young's vocals and
particularly his lyrics leave a bit to
be desired in certain songs.
Young strains his voice so
much in T-Bone Walker's "T-Bone
Shuffle" that it almost seems like
he is in the wrong key. He has a
good, smooth voice, but in that
song, at least, his vocal comes off
as unnatural.
The same problem afflicts
portions of the recently
overrecorded "Jambalaya (On the
Bayou)." Young's version is not
much better than either the
Carpenters' or John Fogerty's
remakes of the same song,
although again, the horn
arrang are a big plus on the
Young version.
The ideas behind Young's
lyrics are practically
interchangeable in four of the six
songs he composed for the record.
"Morning Sun," "Ridgetop,"
"Evenin' " and "Country Home"
all show his love for his home and
the beautiful surroundings and
people there.
Unlikely Rhymes
Young loses another point for
non-creative lyricisism in "Miss
Hesitation," as the words sound
like he plucked likely pairs out of
the thesaurus without giving
thought to meaning or purpose in
the song:
"Miss Hesitation

Lord, you are a sweet temptation
And you've got a look like suction
Mama can I get an introduction."
Warner Brothers should give
this album free to anyone who
can define " a look like suction."
Noah Webster probably turned
over in his grave a couple of times
for that one.
The album also comes out on
the short end musically when the
musicians attempte styles that are
out of their range of competence.
The shuffle piano in "T-Bone
Shuffle" is styleless, monotonous,
played as if the pianist, Scott
Lawrence, were just learning the
basics of boogie woogie
improvisation.
The sax solo which comprises
the last half of "Ridgetop" is fair
musically, yet overdone in length.
As a result, the song sounds like a
filler, dragging on lifelessly to take
up space on the record.
Overall, the record is fine. The
negative points of the album are
much less apparent to a casual
listener than to one who has heard
the record over and over,
emjoying it each time it is played.
If Song For Juli is to be a
milestone in Jesse Cofin Young's
career, it could be the turning
point of his career, the threshold
to superstardom. However, this
album is only a beginning for him;
it is not the final work which will
catapult him onto center stage.

Singing has always been a
problem for Leo Kottke, and on
this new album, for some reason,
he does more of it than he ever
has. As a result, there is less of
Kottke's fine 12-string guitar
work and more of his uninspired
vocals on Ice Water than on his
earlier collections. The result is
unsatisfying.
For this album, Kottke adds a
backup band which features Cal
Hand on dobro and steel guitar.
Unfortunately, the whole group
seems at best mediocre, so they
lend almost no variety to the
album. Most of the time the four
backup players make a negligible
contribution: it sounds like a solo
album.
The album's best tracks are,
not surprisingly, the
instru mentals. "A Good Egg"
presents the kind of lively
country-flavored guitar work that
Kottke does best. Also notable is
"Short Stories," a medley on
which Cal Hand gives his only
significant performance of the
album on steel guitar.
Kottke's songs are, for the
most part, a disaster. Not only are
his lyrics uniformly forgettable,
but they are also set to
insignificant tunes. Kottke's guitar
breaks salvage a few of his
compositions, but they remain a
waste of time.
"You Tell Me Why" and "Born

to Be with You," two country
standbuys, are acceptable vocal
tracks, but Kottke's singing is
dull. It is unfortunate that he does
not use his instrumental talents to
back a good country vocalist or to
work with other musicians of his
caliber. As long as he insists on
doing everything on his albums,
he will continue to produce fair
but disappointing records like Ice
Water.

Despite initial unfavorable
reviews (notably one in Rolling
Stone) and an unbelievable
$11.98 list price, Elton John's
latest double-album release,
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, has
proved itself a smash hit.
During its first few weeks of
release the album kept its critics
guessing. Some rock analysts
pegged lyrics like "You know you
can't hold me forever/ I didn't
sign up with you" and "I've
finally decided my future lies
beyond the yellow brick road" as
meaning Elton was fed up with
the lights and the glitter and had
decided to quit.
Others supposed the lyrics
spelled a split between John and
Bernie Taupin, his lyricist and
close personal friend.
All poppycock. "That must be
a promotional gimmick," said the
wife of an MCA exec at a party.
Change, Not End
What Goodbye Yellow Brick
Road symbolizes more than the
end of John's, or maybe more
correctly the John-Taupin,
musical career is Elton's farewell
forever to the quiet, reflective,
moving music and the
introspective, starry lyrics that
launched the British
pianist-composer to superstardom
only four years ago.
In contrast to his seven
previous albums, Yellow Brick
Road can be summarized in one
word â€” vulgar.
The depravity in the album
centers mostly around the lyrical
subjects and the actual lines of the
songs. The two discs contain tunes
centered around: a funeral, a
suicide (actress Marilyn Monroe),
a bisexual rock group advocating
street violence against parents, an
erotic Jamaican dance, a
prostitute, a gangster shotgunned
to death, a girl who hasn't bathed
in years, a 16 year-old lesbian, a
juvenile delinquent who loves to
get drunk and fight and "a
genuine example of a social
disease."
Not exactly your average
family album song themes. Nor is
the music your average Elton John
with its basically straight
rock'n'roll emphasis and heavy
use of Davey Johnstone's electric
guitar.
Some Of His Best
Strangely enough, the coarse
words and the sometimes coarse.

sometimes beautiful music
actually come together superbly.
The album sings with some of the
finest material Elton John has
released to date.
Songs such as "Saturday
Night's Alright For Fightin' " and
the title cut have become popular
with top-40 listeners who have
hated Elton's music before, while
others such as the magnificent
"Funeral For A Friend/ Love Lies
Bleeding" medley and "Candle In
The Wind" have served as fine FM
fare.
Only those who enjoyed Elton
solely for the quiet songs like
"Your Song," "Sixty Years On,"
"Tiny Dancer" and "Rocket
Man" will be disappointed by
Yellow Brick Road. The slow
tunes on this album such as
"Harmony" and "I've Seen That
Movie Too" are miserably
uninspired and disappointing.
And the only word for the
popular "Bennie and the Jets" in
which Elton stutters through a
half dozen "B-b-b-bennies" is
b-b-b-bad.
Even for the $11.98 list price
(you can buy it most anywhere
for $7.98), Goodbye Yellow Brick
Road is well worth the expense if
both your solid rock'n'roll
enjoyment level and your
"gross-out" level are high. Or just
ignore the words.
-M.S.

It is hard to avoid overworked
adjectives like "important" and
"influential" to describe the
Buffalo Springfield. During the
band's few years together in the
60s, they produced three albums
which are memorable both in
their own right and as indicators
of popular music trends which
followed.
Most of the material on these
three albums has now been
re-released on a double album.
Buffalo Springfield: is not just
another "greatest hits" album, for
it includes more material than it
excludes.
The only feature of this
package which is new to
Springfield fans is a nine-minute
version of "Bluebird." Before you
rush out to buy the album to hear
this never-recorded piece, be
advised: it is actually the version
from which the track on Buffalo
Springfield Again was cut. At the
point where the latter breaks to
the banjo part, this version splits
to an extended jam punctuated by
Stills' voice at its raunchiest. The
instrumental is in the style of live
Springfield, rather loose and free
for its time. However, only the
most voracious fans of the band
will find it sufficient reason to
buy this album; all of the other
cuts are here intact.
The real value of this album is
that it assembles essentially all of

the recordings of one of the rock
groups of the late 60s. For those
who have only recently discovered
these musicians through such
groups as Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young, Poco, and Loggins and
Messina, the old Springfield
material offers an extended look
at their musical growth.
This collection also shows the
Springfield's anticipation of many
musical trends of subsequent
years. A country influence is
present as early as the first album.
Stills brought Latin influences to
the band, especially on Last Time
Around. But the predominant
sound which the group added to
the musical scene was the mixture
of acoustic and electric guitars
which made tunes like "Bluebird"
and "For What It's Worth"
distinctive.
Jean-Charles Costa's liner notes
are a nice addition to the album.
His history of the band is brief
but informative, especially on the
formation of the group (yes, the
name did come from the back of a
steamroller on the L.A. streets).

McCartney Matures

Paul McCartney, Linda McCartney,
Denny Laine:
Band on the Run
Apple SO 3415
Paul McCartney's latest release,
Band on the Run, is one of the
most innovative and enjoyable
albums to hit the market in the
last few months.
Surprisingly devoid of the
top-40 teeny-boppin' saccharine
music that has characterized the
McCartney of recent years, Band
on the Run makes an honest
attempt to please its audience
with mature, well-written and
well-performed songs.
Paul, wife Linda and Denny
Laine are particularly apt in laying
down some fine harmonies, and
even though the lyrics seem to get
in the way at points, the
McCartney and Wings vocals make
them more than palatable.
McCartney experiments with a
wide range of instruments on the
album, incuding synthesizer, tenor
sax and clarinet. The synthesizer
work on the album is especially
noteworthy because it blends in
well with the musical themes and
is not employed as a gimmick.
The album vibrates with solid
rock 4 n' roll, reminiscent of the
energy Beatle albums had. "Helen
Wheels" is an especially fine
rockin' cut.
The album stalls only with
"Mamunia," a light but
meaningless ditty that launches
side two. Parts of "Picasso's Last
Words" drag, while a chorus of
"ho hey ho" is really annoying in
"Mrs. Vanderbilt." Other than
those minor points, the album
sings.
McCartney is mystic as ever in
his lyrics, talking about a "major
(who) was a lady suffragette."
And whoever heard of a band on
the run from some evil force
(remember the Beatles' Help)?
"I can't get excited over
McCartney anymore," a friend of
mine said after hearing snatches of
Band on the Run.
Well, believe it or not, it's time
to get excited about Paul again.
This album is the best he's put out
since forming Wings, and it's darn
good.

lOcc Debut A Dud

10 cc:
10 cc
UK (London): UKS 53105
lOcc's first effort has to be the
most overrated work to hit the
record scene in recent months.
Rock music critics from both
Europe and the U.S. have
acclaimed the British quartet's
album as "deftly hilarious,"
"highly original and extremely
eclectic," "daffy, dazzling,"
"simply great."
These rave reviews might spur
you to rush out and buy this
"fantastic" album, but don't
waste your money. Listen to it
and you'll be extremely
disappointed.
The best one can say about
lOcc is that it is different. The
group displays momentary lapses
into brilliance, however most of
the alleged humor in the lyrics
falls flat.
While Britishers may go wild
over "bombshell hits" about a
96-pound weakling, an
over-ambitious "headline
hustling" journalist or a lonely
frustrated patient stuck in a
hospital bed, these songs are duds
here in the States.
The only single to make any
noice in the U.S. was "Rubber
Bullets," an imaginative Beach
Boys parody that came off very
well.
Other satires on early 60s
grease rock don't do so well.
"Johnny Don't Do It"and
"Donna" seem to lack the energy
to make them hits here even
though "Donna" was a number
one smash in Britain.
The group's music succeeds at
times only because all four
musicians play together with a
tight sound. Not one of them
displays tremendous individual
musical or vocal talent.
More than one critic has
favorably compared lead guitarist
Eric Stewart's style with that of
George Harrison. If Stewart is that

good, he certainly exhibits very
little of his talent on the album.
Bassist Graham Gouldman has
composed several worthwhile hit
songs for other British groups â€”
"For Your Love" for the
Yardbirds, "No Milk Today" for
Herman's Hermits and "Bus Stop"
for the Hollies. However for 10
cc, Gouldman as well as Stewart,
drummer Kevin Godley and
keyboards/vocalist Lol Creme
muster only one really fine work
for all their creative talents.
"Our songs are a bit crazy,"
Creme admitted. The band
attempts to combine zany humor
and good rock music, but the
humor is often sick and the music
suffers from real lack of
commitment.
It's really difficult to take a
band seriously when its musicians
don't take their own music
seriously.

Alexander's Blues:
Uptown, Downhome

Dave Alexander:
The Dirt On The Ground
Arhoolie 1071

Jazz-blues pianist Dave
Alexander's second LP for
Berkeley's Arhoolie label deserves
to be named the best blues record
of 1973. Not because it's just
good blues (which it is), but
because it's one of the most
innovative, "newest" things to
come to blues music since Little
Walter decided to blow his
harmonica through an amplifier.
Shades of Mose Allison, Horace
Silver, Nat Cole, Ray Charles and
Art Tatum are all blended into
Alexander's piano and vocal work.
That highly influential art form
known as the blues is finally
recycling itself through jazz back
into its own music, but now in a
newer, much-changed form.
Along with the jazzier
influences, Alexander also relies
heavily on the sounds of Muddy
Waters, 8.8. King, Otis Spann

and other blues giants for support.
All of the selections on the LP
are originals, with the exception
of the standard "St. James
Infirmary," which is revived with
new intensity in Alexander's
hands.
The album opens with "The
Hoodoo Man, The Voodoo
Woman, and The Witch Doctor,"
which is based on jazz pianist
Horace Silver's "Senor Blues."
Alexander wrote the tune at the
Ann Arbor Blues Festival of 1970,
when he was the "house pianist"
for the festival.
Some of the tunes were written
even earlier, and it has taken
Alexander this long to put them
on wax.
All ten of the songs on the LP
are excellent, and each is unique.
The title song, "The Dirt On The
Ground," is a 3/4 waltz about a

black cowboy, "Jimmy, Is That
You" is a tribute to the early
Chicago pianist Jimmy Yancey,
"Strange Woman" adds a touch of
soul.
The best number is "Suffering
With The Lowdown Blues" which,
unlike the title might suggest, is a
bouncy sort of shuffle.
Alexander's piano work is
amazing throughout, far
surpassing his earlier works for
Arhoolie on The Rattler (1067).

After 15 years of kicking
around the Bay Area, jamming
with every blues and jazz musician
that came to town, Alexander has
finally found his groove. He is
possibly the best, most versatile,
most creative pianist currently
playing blues.
His slightly "uptown" vocal
style is also quite a nice chnage
from the basic blues shouting, of
which there are so many
followers.
