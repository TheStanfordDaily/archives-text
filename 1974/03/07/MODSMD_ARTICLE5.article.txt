## Rachmanioff's 'Bells' Head New Releases 
### KIP CRANNA BRUCE LAMOTT 
Rachmaninoff: The Bells, Op. 35;
Three Russian Songs, Op. 41
Phyllis Curtin, soprano; George
Shirley, tenor; Michael Devlin,
baritone; Temple University
Chors, Robert Page, director;
Philadelphia Orchestra, Eugene
Ormandy, conductor.
RCA Victor ARLII-0193S

Though he is best known for
his piano music, last year's
centennial celebration of
Rachmaninoff's birth has directed
deserved attention to some of his
other compositions, a fine
sampling of which can be found in
this lavish recording of his choral
"symphony," The Bells. Based on
a Russian translation of Poe's
famous poem, the four
movements of the work chime
their way through a musical
lifetime, from youthful sleighbells
to desolate funeral bells.
Resisting the temptation to
resort to the literal sound-painting
of percussion instruments,
Rachmaninoff relies chiefly on
voices and standard orchestral
instruments in his sweeping,
operatic-style setting. The
approach is a histrionic and
romantic one which chooses to
ignore the relentless rhythms and
compelling repetition of Poe's
poetry, inclining instead toward
an expansive, exultant wallowing
in the rich sounds conjured up by
the bells. (One can easily imagine
how differently another Russian,
Stravinsky, would have set such a
text.)
The Three Russian Songs,
featuring alto and bass voices
singing largely in unison to
intricate orchestral
accompaniment, are strongly
folk-like in character, with
plaintive, pseudo-modal melodies.
The Temple University Chors

perform with remarkable
precision and maturity of sound,
and the soloists are first-rate.
Ormandy leads the Philadelphia
Orchestra with his customary
excellence.
Though all the works are sung
in English (in re-translation in the
case of The Bells), the sound is
often a bit too big for clarity, but
no printed texts are provided.
Alas, one can't have everything.

Mahler: Symphony of a Thousand
Joyce Barker, Elizabeth Simon,
Norma Burrowes, Joyce
Black ham, Af f reda Hodgson, John
Mitchinson, Raymond Myers,
Gwynne Howell, soloists; various
choruses; Symphonica of London,
Wyn Morris, conductor.
RCA CRL 2 0359

Don't let the obscurity of
groups such as the Finchley
Children's Music Group and the
Orpington Junior Singers, not to
mention the soloists and
conductor, lead you to
conclusions about the quality of
this budget-label issue. Though
the mammoth forces required for
the Mahler Eighth make a
potential pitfall in each additional
performing ensemble, this
performance is a compelling,
grandiose reading of Mahler's
apotheosis of the creative genius.
The adult choruses — the New
Philharmonia Chorus,
Bruckner-Mahler Choir of
London and Ambrosian Singers —
reflect the vigorous choral
tradition of the Britons, and the
whole is brought together with
sweeping impact from the first
chord of "Veni Creator Spiritus."
Conductor Morris favors an
expansive, sometimes
cumbersome interpretation, but
one which exploits the sumptuous

orchestration of the score. The
most conspicuous loss of energy
comes when he overrides the
metric transformation which
climaxes and .concludes the first
movement. However, he
commands a fine ensemble, which
was first heard in 1972.
Sopranos Barker, Simon and
Burrowes are outstanding in
contending with nearly
insurmountable lines, though the
other soloists have some difficulty
in coordinating ensemble in spots.
The two-disc recording gives
suitable, if somewhat reverberant
support to the multitude, allowing
an overwhelming score to do just
that.
The New Age Of Bel Canto
Opera arias by Rossini, Donizetti,
Bellini, and Verdi sung by Caballe,
Callas, de los Angeles, Frenzi,
Gedda and Sills.
Angel S-36933
The florid Italian vocal
technique known as bel canto
(literally "beautiful singing")
dominated the operatic repertoire
of the nineteenth century until
the onset (or onslaught) of the
Wagnerian style. Recently a
generation of opera superstars
have initiated a revival of this
literature — operas in which vocal
agility and virtuosity often
outweight dramatic substance.
This sampler of Angel
recordings, the latest installment
in the Angel Voices series, offers a
variety of artists, orchestras, and
composers, giving the listener a
chance to compare some
prominent voices as well as
speculate on the nature of the
ephemeral bel canto technique.
Certainly the repertoire itself does
not make a bel canto singer, as the
embarassing Callas excerpts from
Lucia di Lammermoor and La

Generentola prove. In contrast to
her clumsy and uneven
performance is the grace and
fluidity of Mirella Frenzi singing
"Qui la voce" from I Puritani, an
outstanding selection.
Nicolai Gedda's "Una furtiva
lagrima" has a luxuriant tone,
tenderly restrained. But the
dramatic variegation of Monserrat
Caballe's scene from' II Pirata
shows that the repertoire is not
dependent on technique alone.
Surprising disappointing are
the contributions of Victoria de
los Angeles and Beverly Sills.
Though vocally superb, de los
Angeles gives a minimum of
characterization to "Una voce
poco fa," and Sills' "Addio del
Passato" from La Traviata
concludes the album with a
painfully flat fortissimo.
Considering the diversity of
sources, the album jacket would
well have included the recording
dates, if only in fairness to the
performers.

Luciano Berio:
Recital I (For Cathy)
Cathy Berberian, soprano; The
London Sinfonietta, Luciano
Berio, conductor.
RCA Victor ARL 1-0036S
"Life is only accumula
tion. ..declares the singer
halfway through this high-strung
collage of words and sounds, and
that fairly well sums up the
essense of the composition. Based
on methods already employed
with success in his
much-acclaimed Sinfonia of 1968,
Italian-born composer Luciano
Berio's new creation offers a
stream-of-consciousness blend of
random spoken statements of his
own composition, mixed with
snatches of songs by composers

ranging from Stavinsky to Purcell.
Soprano Cathy Berberian
displays her remarkable vocal and
dramatic talents amidst a
mult-barreled barrage of
accompaniment, including a
harpsichord, three pianos, a
chamber orchestra and assorted
electronic groans and chirps. The
spoken text, though often
hovering just below the level of
total coherenence, offers
moments of intensity and
profound impact, as well as some
amusing self-deprecation ("... if a
musician talks instead of playing
he becomes socially
embarassing..
Most avant-garde works of this
type seem to require the
assistance of detailed
program-note explanations of
what's happening, and these are
amply provided for here in liner
notes by Misha Donat. Recital I is
a "theater piece," and with the
recorded version we miss some
apparently important visual
effects (including a modified
version of musical chairs played
by five masked musicians).
The work is hardly easily
listening — at first reaction it may
sound like background music for
an exoricsm — but if a listener is
in the mood to concentrate he
will find some absorbing sounds
here, splendidly recorded and
with some ear-catching stereo
effects. It's the kind of record
that should be listened to in the
dark.

Handel: Favorite Music From
Handel's Messiah
Jennifer Vyvyan, Monica Sinclair,
Jon Wickers, Giorgio Tozzi,
soloists; Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra and Chorus; Sir Thomas
Beech am, conductor.
RCA CRL 2-0192
This reissue of the late Sir
Thomas Beecham's performance
in a two-record budget album
shows little faith in the composer
and underestimates the attentive
capacity of the listener. Although
Beecham's 1959 essay appearing
on the jacket contains an apologia
for the orchestration by Sir
Eugene Goossens in the interest of
"reviving" Handel for the modern
audience, the continuous tradition
of Messiah performances would
hardly find it in need of revival.
Moreover, "orchestration" is
barely adequate to describe the
incursions of piccolo, snare drum,
cymbals and triangle into the
"Hallelujah Chorus," of harp and
clarinet into the Overture, not to
mention the banishment of the
continuo organ . and/or
harpsichord altogether.
Leaving matters of
ornamentation, ensemble balance
and consistency aside, what
results in this interpretation is
more Sousa than Handel. If
monotony were as problematic as
Beecham claimed, the remedy lay
more in reviving his ponderous
tempos than in kaleidoscopic
instrumentation.
The soloists are appropriate to
the performance, heroic and
lugubrious. The recording itself
shows similar questionable
judgment in separating the
contralto recitative, "Behold a
virgin shall conceive" from its aria
by a change of record.
