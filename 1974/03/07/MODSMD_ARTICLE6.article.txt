# The 						Well-Tempered Record Buyer
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
The classical record buyer who comes
home from a concert determined to have
that Mozart symphony and the rock freak
who just grooved out on a new release in
the top 40 will find themselves in quite
different situations in the record store the
next day. Watching the freak smugly head
for the checkstand with his new album,
taken from a stack of a hundred of the
same, the concertgoer stares in dismay at a
bin of twenty different recordings at four
different prices — all containing that
cherished symphony.
How can the buyer tell which is the
"best" recording? Which one will duplicate
the same musical experience he had in the
concert hall last night? What do the prices
— which vary as much as 100 percent — tell
him about his purchase? From someone
whose record shelf is stocked with enough
turkeys to prove that there are no
foolproof answers, here are a few
considerations for the prospective shopper.
Know what you want. In case you hear
it on the radio, listen carefully for the
composer, title, and performer; you can
then locate the recording in the Schwann
catalog. If you miss this announcement,
note the exact time of day and call the
station; they'll be happy to know that you
were listening. Live performances present
the problem of choosing an acceptable
interpretation, but for starters, not the
specific title, including opus number and
key, which appears on the program.
Know what you like. Herein lies the

problem of the "best" recording of any
work. Remember that it is your record you
are buying, and although your musical
taste will be affected by hearing it
repeatedly, it is your taste which should
determine the interpretation you select.
Record reviews and opinions from
musicians may be more informed about the
specifics of musical interpretation, but take
these opinions for what they say about the
album itself; a good review or opinion will
describe the performance as well as
evaluate it. If a critic's "bombastic,
hysterical Mahler" or "cerebral Bach"
appeals to you, don't let his invective deter
you. He won't be listening to your
collection.
Money is no object. There is little
correlation between quality performances
and the great price disparity you find in
classical albums; date and country of origin
have far more effect on price than artistic
concerns. Remember that vintage
recordings rereleased on budget labels
often contain superb interpretations
unequalled by newer releases, but be ready
to tolerate less effective technical
engineering.
It is fairly safe to assume that current
releases, regardless of price, are technically
acceptable to all but the zealot audiophile
— who should be listening to the music
instead of the distortion anyway. However,
you may expect some inconsistency in
excerpted or "sampler" recordings
compiled from several sources. Remember
that a "live, in concert" recording may

compensate in spontaneity and freshness
what it lacks in engineered perfection.
What's in a name? The classical world
has its superstars, too — many with
deserved reputations. But there are many
other performers who, by limiting output
to quality or specialization, have produced
masterworks in relative obscurity.
Remember that musical artistry is seldom
newsworthy; a colorful temperament,
torrid love affair, or musico-political
triumph say little about musicianship.
Become familiar with a performer's special
interests and proficiencies; it is highly
unlikely, unless you go in for the
personality cult, that you will find any
artist who performs or conducts all styles
of music equally well.
One place where some name-dropping
will save you from a bad buy, however, is
in chamber music. Unless you are certain
of a particular performance by a dark
horse, sticking with ensembles of known
reputation will spare you the expense of an
album which you might endure but once.
Hermann Hortzendorf may do just fine
playing fourth-stand second violin in your
recording of the Klagenfurter
Musikfreunde, but when he's performing a
solo sonata, you may be playing
budget-label roulette! The same holds for
singers.
You may also want to identify with a
style or ensemble for Early Music — up to
and including the Baroque. The variety of
interpretations exercised in the relatively
recent study of performance practice is

considerable and startlingly divergent.
Though there is some good reason for
preferring the more recent productions in
this area, the listener should pay special
attention to the performing ensemble, the
instruments used, and the performance
practice often described on the jacket.
If some is good, more is not always
better. Before you buy that complete set
of anyone's works for anything, be sure
that you really want all that it offers. If
you want a particular Beethoven piano
sonata, is it likely that you will listen to
the other thirty-one and be satisfied with
one interpretation? Even though the
price-per-disc is lower on boxed sets, the
totalv rarely equals what you would pay
for the music you were after. By the same
token, though, be aware of what you are
getting for your money; will a budget-label
opera without libretto really suit your
needs?
Above all, listen to organic music
without preservatives. Rather than turning
your living room into a concert hall, take
the cheaper route and turn yourself into
the nearest concert hall. You can attend a
whole year-full of live performances for
less than it would cost to add that extra
two inches to your woofers. Remember
that recordings, for all their value, are
compilations of numerous performances
made by virtuoso sound engineers. Though
they provide essential access to a repertoire
far beyond that encountered in any one
cultural area, they do not substitute for the
live musical experience sought by any true
well-tempered listener.
