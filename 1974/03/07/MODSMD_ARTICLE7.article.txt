# Four-Channel Sound Growing
## 'Quad' Is Here To Stay 
### JAY HARLOW 
Stereophonic recording was
invented because people have two
ears, so quadrophonic is for
people with four ears, right?
Wrong.
One of the major innovations
in sound reproduction in the last
few decades, quad adds another
dimension to stereo, and allows a
much wider range of effects. Its
enthusiasts claim that quad is a
greater improvement over stereo
than stereo was over monaural.
Briefly, here is the difference:
monaural sound has a single
channel, and sound emanates
from a single point, namely the
speaker. Stereo involves a
two-part signal, and splitting the
sound between two speakers adds
a linear dimension. Quad
recording adds a second
dimension of depth to the sound
reproduction.
There are two approaches to
the use of quad, which can be
illustrated by the example of a
symphony orchestra. One method
is to try to reproduce the ambient
quality of the concert hall, by
using the rear channels to capture
the reverberations from the walls.
By playing back directly what is
heard from the front and from the
back of the hall, the listener gets
the effect of sitting in the middle
of the hall.
'Involvement' Of Listener
A second, "involvement"
approach proportions the sound
among the four channels in order
to give the listener the effect of
being right in the middle of the
orchestra, perhaps on the
conductor's stand.
While ambient quality is most
satisfactory for symphonic
recording, the involvement
approach offers space for
creativity in rock and
experimental music. Special stereo
effects are relatively common in
current music, and the addition of
another dimension offers record
producers a greatly expanded
playground. Proportioning sound
among the four channels, the

producer can place any
instrument or voice anywhere in
the room.
Attempts at four-channel
sound reproduction began in the
early 1970s with the matrix or
"SQ" system developed by
Columbia Records. This system
involves a phase-delay process in
the playback system, where a
two-channel (stereo) signal is
mechanically delayed before being
played through the rear speakers.
The SQ system requires no special
equipment other than a
four-channel amplifier with a
"matrix decoder" delay system.
Discrete Four-Channel
The other system, which has
been adopted by most major
record manufacturers, is the
discrete or "Quadradisc" process
developed by RCA. In this
system, four discrete channels are
recorded on the record grooves. A
special Shabata split stylus is
required, as each channel is
carried by either horizontal or
vertical movements on one side of
the groove. The cartridge requires
four sets of wires rather than two,
which necessitates redesign or
rewiring of stereo turntables.
Stereo records can be played on a
Quadradisc turntable, and
manufacturers claim the sound is
better than normal stereo due to
the sensitivity of the Shabata
stylus.
Several equipment
manufacturers have produced
components for each system.
Dynaco, Fischer, Sony and
Marantz marketed matrix-decoder
systems soon after the technique
was developed. Panasonic and
Marantz among others have since
produced amps which can handle
either discrete or matrix
quadrophonic sound.
In addition to amplifiers and
turntables, other quad accessories
have recently appeared on the
market. One of the most
intriguing developments is quad
headphones. Koss and Stanton
have recently come out with

headphones which have two
separate drivers (speakers) in each
earpiece. These allow for a
spectrum of sound forward to
back as well as side to side.
At present, it appears that the
two systems will both be around
for some time. While most of the
major record firms are producing
discrete records, Columbia is
maintaining its interest in matrix
discs, as these are more
compatible with existing stereo
systems.


WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? — There are two major systems calling
themselves quadrophonic sound on the market. Neither is the definite
winner yet, so some manufacturers have equipment to handle both SQ
and discrete four-channel sound.

systems.


WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? — There are two major systems calling
themselves quadrophonic sound on the market. Neither is the definite
winner yet, so some manufacturers have equipment to handle both SQ
and discrete four-channel sound.
Stereophonic recording was
invented because people have two
ears, so quadrophonic is for
people with four ears, right?
Wrong.
One of the major innovations
in sound reproduction in the last
few decades, quad adds another
dimension to stereo, and allows a
much wider range of effects. Its
enthusiasts claim that quad is a
greater improvement over stereo
than stereo was over monaural.
Briefly, here is the difference:
monaural sound has a single
channel, and sound emanates
from a single point, namely the
speaker. Stereo involves a
two-part signal, and splitting the
sound between two speakers adds
a linear dimension. Quad
recording adds a second
dimension of depth to the sound
reproduction.
There are two approaches to
the use of quad, which can be
illustrated by the example of a
symphony orchestra. One method
is to try to reproduce the ambient
quality of the concert hall, by
using the rear channels to capture
the reverberations from the walls.
By playing back directly what is
heard from the front and from the
back of the hall, the listener gets
the effect of sitting in the middle
of the hall.
'Involvement' Of Listener
A second, "involvement"
approach proportions the sound
among the four channels in order
to give the listener the effect of
being right in the middle of the
orchestra, perhaps on the
conductor's stand.
While ambient quality is most
satisfactory for symphonic
recording, the involvement
approach offers space for
creativity in rock and
experimental music. Special stereo
effects are relatively common in
current music, and the addition of
another dimension offers record
producers a greatly expanded
playground. Proportioning sound
among the four channels, the

producer can place any
instrument or voice anywhere in
the room.
Attempts at four-channel
sound reproduction began in the
early 1970s with the matrix or
"SQ" system developed by
Columbia Records. This system
involves a phase-delay process in
the playback system, where a
two-channel (stereo) signal is
mechanically delayed before being
played through the rear speakers.
The SQ system requires no special
equipment other than a
four-channel amplifier with a
"matrix decoder" delay system.
Discrete Four-Channel
The other system, which has
been adopted by most major
record manufacturers, is the
discrete or "Quadradisc" process
developed by RCA. In this
system, four discrete channels are
recorded on the record grooves. A
special Shabata split stylus is
required, as each channel is
carried by either horizontal or
vertical movements on one side of
the groove. The cartridge requires
four sets of wires rather than two,
which necessitates redesign or
rewiring of stereo turntables.
Stereo records can be played on a
Quadradisc turntable, and
manufacturers claim the sound is
better than normal stereo due to
the sensitivity of the Shabata
stylus.
Several equipment
manufacturers have produced
components for each system.
Dynaco, Fischer, Sony and
Marantz marketed matrix-decoder
systems soon after the technique
was developed. Panasonic and
Marantz among others have since
produced amps which can handle
either discrete or matrix
quadrophonic sound.
In addition to amplifiers and
turntables, other quad accessories
have recently appeared on the
market. One of the most
intriguing developments is quad
headphones. Koss and Stanton
have recently come out with

headphones which have two
separate drivers (speakers) in each
earpiece. These allow for a
spectrum of sound forward to
back as well as side to side.
At present, it appears that the
two systems will both be around
for some time. While most of the
major record firms are producing
discrete records, Columbia is
maintaining its interest in matrix
discs, as these are more
compatible with existing stereo
systems.
