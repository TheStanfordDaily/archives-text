"In 1951 an inspired piece of casting brought Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn together
in The African Queen...Bogart and Hepburn played together with an ease and humor that makes
their love affair-the mating of a forbidding ironclad spinster and a tough, gin soaked riverboat
captain-seem not only inevitable but perfect..This is a comedy, a love story, and a tale of adven
ture, and it is one of the most charming and entertaining movies ever made.. "—Pauline Kael
