Our Officer Selection Officers are looking for a few good college men—
maybe 3 out of 100—who will make good Marine officers. If you're one of
them, we'll give you a chance to prove it during summer training at Quan
tico, Virginia.
Our program is Platoon Leaders Class, PLC. With ground, air and law
options. You might even qualify for up to $2,700 to help you through college.
But if money is all you're looking for, don't waste your time.
The challenge is leadership. If you want it, work for it. If you've got it,
show us. It's one hell of a challenge. But we're looking for one hell of a man.
