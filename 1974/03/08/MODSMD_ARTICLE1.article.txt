# $80 Million Budget Unveiled; Report Seeks Tenure Guidelines
## 
### DIANE NORBURG 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
received two documents destined to be
potent forces in the University's
future. Details of the Proposed
Operating Budget Guidelines for
1974-75 and the Report of the
Committee on the Professoriate at
Stanford were made public for the
first time.
Provost William Miller led the
presentation of background
information and recommendations for
next year's operating budget, totaling
$80 million. Miller explained the
operating budget represents only 34
percent of the University's
consolidated budgets and includes all

of the unrestricted funds available to
the University.
Included in the operating budget
are the basic expenses of schools and
departments, student services,
libraries, administration, operations
and maintenance, development and
the unrestricted portions of student
aid.
(The operating budget does not
include federally sponsored research
grants or contracts, residences and
dining halls, Tresidder, intercollegiate
athletics, the University Press,
Stanford Hospital, SLAC or service
centers. Each of these is financially
self-contained or falls into the
consolidated budget pool.)
Goes To Trustees Next Week
The operating budget
recommendations are to be presented
to the Board of Trustees on Monday
and Tuesday for approval. Research
and preparation of next year's budget
by members of the central
administration, deans and other
administrative officers began in July,
1973.
The primary goal of the 1974-75
budget is to achieve a balanced
operating budget after working with a
deficit for several years, President
Richard Lyman said in his
introductory remarks.
Lyman explained that the fifth and
final year of the Budget Adjustment

Program (BAP-5), the Campaign for
Stanford and reallocation efforts
within departments combine with the
proposed budget to protect "the
long-run equilibrium of the
University's financial situation."
Endowment Crucial
Lyman also noted, "We are more
conscious of the importance of
endowment to the University than
ever before." The report shows that
although an increased total
endowment is expected, the
percentage of unrestricted endowment
will go down.
Also scheduled to increase is tuition
income, with a $240 tuition rate rise
per student and a greater number of
full-time graduate students causing the
upswing.
A substantial increase in gifts and
grants to the University is also
expected, primarily due to increased
gifts to the School of Medicine and the
success of the Campaign for Stanford.
A critical aspect of the budget
proposals is the use of BAP-5 to
eliminate budget deficits and reduce
the rate of expenditure increase in the
operating budget. A faculty and
student committee reviewed BAP-5
recommendations from various
departments and administrators before
inclusion in the report.
Med, Biz School Cutbacks
BAP-5 recommendations include

reduction of support from the
operating budget for the Schools of
Medicine and Business (whose cuts will
be absorbed by increased reliance on
restricted funds), and an approximate
$60,000 cut in both research and
library funding.
Of special note to students is the
BAP-5 proposal to cut $30,000 in
expenses by eliminating photo student
identification cards and trimming the
ASSU and Cowell Health Center
budgets.
By far the greatest proposed cut is
to fall in the administrative sector,
where $191,000 is to be eliminated,
mostly through staff reductions.
The expenditure side of the
1974-75 budget shows a net increase
of $6.4 million. Increases relevant to
undergraduate education will include
support of the Human Biology
program, $33,000 to women's
intercollegiate athletic competition
and teaching appointments in art and
history.
More Graduate Fellowships
Significant increases in
expenditures are also planned with a
$140,000 contribution to graduate
fellowships. Costs will also rise for
planned additional teaching assistant
positions, the residence counseling
program and the Departments of
Athletics and Public Events, among

other areas.
Increases to the continuing faculty
salary base are slated for six percent,
meaning that the salary increases will
be distributed within departments as a
function of merit, promotions and
special circumstances. Faculty salary
increases were computed with the rise
in the consumer price index and
comparisons with other universities in
mind, Miller said.
Significant increases in expenditure
are also charted for management and
maintenance.
Professoriate Report
The other important document,
presented to the Senate by Human
Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh, was an
extensive set of recommendations for
the future of the professoriate here.
Distilling the 150-page report into a
half-hour presentation, Pittendrigh
said the committee's single most
important conclusion is that the
University should develop handbooks
for each school or department,
describing processes of appointment,
promotion and tenure.
"There is a pervasive source of
uneasiness among the junior faculty
and staff when the rules of the game
are not fully known," Pittendrigh said.
There is a clear need for publication
of the criteria used in faculty
appointment and promotion, he
added. For those who are not awarded
tenure, the committee urges that the
reasons should be available in writing
upon the candidate's request.
Relocation Period
The report calls for a one-year
relocation period for persons not

awarded tenure. The committee's
recommendations include a rejection
of a five-year renewable contract
system and a tenure quota system as
possible alternatives to the present
tenure system, which the report called
"indispensable."
Pittendrigh said a major effort
involved the definition of the
professoriate. The report concludes
that the Academic Council should be
exactly equal to the "professoriate"
and both should be enlarged to include
senior research associates and senior
lecturers.
One of the most controversial
aspects of the report is a
recommendation for a substantially
larger clinical professoriate in the
School of Medicine. To minimize the
impact of the proposed 100-member
faculty growth in medicine, the
committee urges a revision of the
Academic Council voting structure.
A copy of the report is scheduled
to be mailed to each current Academic
Council member next Friday.

percent of the University's
consolidated budgets and includes all

of the unrestricted funds available to
the University.
Included in the operating budget
are the basic expenses of schools and
departments, student services,
libraries, administration, operations
and maintenance, development and
the unrestricted portions of student
aid.
(The operating budget does not
include federally sponsored research
grants or contracts, residences and
dining halls, Tresidder, intercollegiate
athletics, the University Press,
Stanford Hospital, SLAC or service
centers. Each of these is financially
self-contained or falls into the
consolidated budget pool.)
Goes To Trustees Next Week
The operating budget
recommendations are to be presented
to the Board of Trustees on Monday
and Tuesday for approval. Research
and preparation of next year's budget
by members of the central
administration, deans and other
administrative officers began in July,
1973.
The primary goal of the 1974-75
budget is to achieve a balanced
operating budget after working with a
deficit for several years, President
Richard Lyman said in his
introductory remarks.
Lyman explained that the fifth and
final year of the Budget Adjustment

Program (BAP-5), the Campaign for
Stanford and reallocation efforts
within departments combine with the
proposed budget to protect "the
long-run equilibrium of the
University's financial situation."
Endowment Crucial
Lyman also noted, "We are more
conscious of the importance of
endowment to the University than
ever before." The report shows that
although an increased total
endowment is expected, the
percentage of unrestricted endowment
will go down.
Also scheduled to increase is tuition
income, with a $240 tuition rate rise
per student and a greater number of
full-time graduate students causing the
upswing.
A substantial increase in gifts and
grants to the University is also
expected, primarily due to increased
gifts to the School of Medicine and the
success of the Campaign for Stanford.
A critical aspect of the budget
proposals is the use of BAP-5 to
eliminate budget deficits and reduce
the rate of expenditure increase in the
operating budget. A faculty and
student committee reviewed BAP-5
recommendations from various
departments and administrators before
inclusion in the report.
Med, Biz School Cutbacks
BAP-5 recommendations include

reduction of support from the
operating budget for the Schools of
Medicine and Business (whose cuts will
be absorbed by increased reliance on
restricted funds), and an approximate
$60,000 cut in both research and
library funding.
Of special note to students is the
BAP-5 proposal to cut $30,000 in
expenses by eliminating photo student
identification cards and trimming the
ASSU and Cowell Health Center
budgets.
By far the greatest proposed cut is
to fall in the administrative sector,
where $191,000 is to be eliminated,
mostly through staff reductions.
The expenditure side of the
1974-75 budget shows a net increase
of $6.4 million. Increases relevant to
undergraduate education will include
support of the Human Biology
program, $33,000 to women's
intercollegiate athletic competition
and teaching appointments in art and
history.
More Graduate Fellowships
Significant increases in
expenditures are also planned with a
$140,000 contribution to graduate
fellowships. Costs will also rise for
planned additional teaching assistant
positions, the residence counseling
program and the Departments of
Athletics and Public Events, among

other areas.
Increases to the continuing faculty
salary base are slated for six percent,
meaning that the salary increases will
be distributed within departments as a
function of merit, promotions and
special circumstances. Faculty salary
increases were computed with the rise
in the consumer price index and
comparisons with other universities in
mind, Miller said.
Significant increases in expenditure
are also charted for management and
maintenance.
Professoriate Report
The other important document,
presented to the Senate by Human
Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh, was an
extensive set of recommendations for
the future of the professoriate here.
Distilling the 150-page report into a
half-hour presentation, Pittendrigh
said the committee's single most
important conclusion is that the
University should develop handbooks
for each school or department,
describing processes of appointment,
promotion and tenure.
"There is a pervasive source of
uneasiness among the junior faculty
and staff when the rules of the game
are not fully known," Pittendrigh said.
There is a clear need for publication
of the criteria used in faculty
appointment and promotion, he
added. For those who are not awarded
tenure, the committee urges that the
reasons should be available in writing
upon the candidate's request.
Relocation Period
The report calls for a one-year
relocation period for persons not

awarded tenure. The committee's
recommendations include a rejection
of a five-year renewable contract
system and a tenure quota system as
possible alternatives to the present
tenure system, which the report called
"indispensable."
Pittendrigh said a major effort
involved the definition of the
professoriate. The report concludes
that the Academic Council should be
exactly equal to the "professoriate"
and both should be enlarged to include
senior research associates and senior
lecturers.
One of the most controversial
aspects of the report is a
recommendation for a substantially
larger clinical professoriate in the
School of Medicine. To minimize the
impact of the proposed 100-member
faculty growth in medicine, the
committee urges a revision of the
Academic Council voting structure.
A copy of the report is scheduled
to be mailed to each current Academic
Council member next Friday.
The Faculty Senate yesterday
received two documents destined to be
potent forces in the University's
future. Details of the Proposed
Operating Budget Guidelines for
1974-75 and the Report of the
Committee on the Professoriate at
Stanford were made public for the
first time.
Provost William Miller led the
presentation of background

self-contained or falls into the
consolidated budget pool.)
Goes To Trustees Next Week
The operating budget
recommendations are to be presented
to the Board of Trustees on Monday
and Tuesday for approval. Research
and preparation of next year's budget
by members of the central
administration, deans and other
administrative officers began in July,
1973.
The primary goal of the 1974-75
budget is to achieve a balanced
operating budget after working with a
deficit for several years, President
Richard Lyman said in his
introductory remarks.
Lyman explained that the fifth and
final year of the Budget Adjustment

Program (BAP-5), the Campaign for
Stanford and reallocation efforts
within departments combine with the
proposed budget to protect "the
long-run equilibrium of the
University's financial situation."
Endowment Crucial
Lyman also noted, "We are more
conscious of the importance of
endowment to the University than
ever before." The report shows that
although an increased total
endowment is expected, the
percentage of unrestricted endowment
will go down.
Also scheduled to increase is tuition
income, with a $240 tuition rate rise
per student and a greater number of
full-time graduate students causing the
upswing.
A substantial increase in gifts and
grants to the University is also
expected, primarily due to increased
gifts to the School of Medicine and the
success of the Campaign for Stanford.
A critical aspect of the budget
proposals is the use of BAP-5 to
eliminate budget deficits and reduce
the rate of expenditure increase in the
operating budget. A faculty and
student committee reviewed BAP-5
recommendations from various
departments and administrators before
inclusion in the report.
Med, Biz School Cutbacks
BAP-5 recommendations include

reduction of support from the
operating budget for the Schools of
Medicine and Business (whose cuts will
be absorbed by increased reliance on
restricted funds), and an approximate
$60,000 cut in both research and
library funding.
Of special note to students is the
BAP-5 proposal to cut $30,000 in
expenses by eliminating photo student
identification cards and trimming the
ASSU and Cowell Health Center
budgets.
By far the greatest proposed cut is
to fall in the administrative sector,
where $191,000 is to be eliminated,
mostly through staff reductions.
The expenditure side of the
1974-75 budget shows a net increase
of $6.4 million. Increases relevant to
undergraduate education will include
support of the Human Biology
program, $33,000 to women's
intercollegiate athletic competition
and teaching appointments in art and
history.
More Graduate Fellowships
Significant increases in
expenditures are also planned with a
$140,000 contribution to graduate
fellowships. Costs will also rise for
planned additional teaching assistant
positions, the residence counseling
program and the Departments of
Athletics and Public Events, among

other areas.
Increases to the continuing faculty
salary base are slated for six percent,
meaning that the salary increases will
be distributed within departments as a
function of merit, promotions and
special circumstances. Faculty salary
increases were computed with the rise
in the consumer price index and
comparisons with other universities in
mind, Miller said.
Significant increases in expenditure
are also charted for management and
maintenance.
Professoriate Report
The other important document,
presented to the Senate by Human
Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh, was an
extensive set of recommendations for
the future of the professoriate here.
Distilling the 150-page report into a
half-hour presentation, Pittendrigh
said the committee's single most
important conclusion is that the
University should develop handbooks
for each school or department,
describing processes of appointment,
promotion and tenure.
"There is a pervasive source of
uneasiness among the junior faculty
and staff when the rules of the game
are not fully known," Pittendrigh said.
There is a clear need for publication
of the criteria used in faculty
appointment and promotion, he
added. For those who are not awarded
tenure, the committee urges that the
reasons should be available in writing
upon the candidate's request.
Relocation Period
The report calls for a one-year
relocation period for persons not

awarded tenure. The committee's
recommendations include a rejection
of a five-year renewable contract
system and a tenure quota system as
possible alternatives to the present
tenure system, which the report called
"indispensable."
Pittendrigh said a major effort
involved the definition of the
professoriate. The report concludes
that the Academic Council should be
exactly equal to the "professoriate"
and both should be enlarged to include
senior research associates and senior
lecturers.
One of the most controversial
aspects of the report is a
recommendation for a substantially
larger clinical professoriate in the
School of Medicine. To minimize the
impact of the proposed 100-member
faculty growth in medicine, the
committee urges a revision of the
Academic Council voting structure.
A copy of the report is scheduled
to be mailed to each current Academic
Council member next Friday.
The Faculty Senate yesterday
received two documents destined to be
potent forces in the University's
future. Details of the Proposed
Operating Budget Guidelines for
1974-75 and the Report of the
Committee on the Professoriate at
Stanford were made public for the
first time.
Provost William Miller led the
presentation of background
information and recommendations for
next year's operating budget, totaling
$80 million. Miller explained the
operating budget represents only 34
percent of the University's
consolidated budgets and includes all

of the unrestricted funds available to
the University.
Included in the operating budget
are the basic expenses of schools and
departments, student services,
libraries, administration, operations
and maintenance, development and
the unrestricted portions of student
aid.
(The operating budget does not
include federally sponsored research
grants or contracts, residences and
dining halls, Tresidder, intercollegiate
athletics, the University Press,
Stanford Hospital, SLAC or service
centers. Each of these is financially
self-contained or falls into the
consolidated budget pool.)
