# Facts About Legalized Abortion
## 
###

As International Women's Day approaches
and the women and men of the Stanford
community are discussing feminism in all its
breadth, there are activities in our federal and
state legislatures that urgently require our
attention.
I am referring to the numerous
constitutional amendments currently under
consideration which would effectively repeal
or dilute the Supreme Court abortion
decision of January, 1973. There have
already been nearly 40 such amendments
introduced in Congress, and at least 12 states
have adopted resolutions supporting them.
The imminent danger to feminine freedom
of choice can hardly be exaggerated. The
amendments proposed have been of two
types: (1) to return the decision regarding
abortion to the states, or (2) to declare that
no state may deprive the fetus, from the
moment of conception, of life without due
process of law.
Would Nullify Decision
Either of these amendments would
completely nullify the Supreme Court
decision, and would again force women into
the jaws of illegal, criminal abortions.
The real political influence of the
supporters of these amendments is
frightening. Their spokesman is the national
Right to Life Committee, strongly backed by
the National Catholic Conference of Bishops.
They are an extremely well-organized and
well-financed lobby, and their tenacity is
astounding. They produce pamphlet after
pamphlet, illustrated with disintegrating
fetuses and packed with misinformation
about the safety and consequences of
abortion.
Vocal Following
And most importantly, their following is

extremely vocal. Day after day their letters
pour into Washington, with most
Congressmen's mail running at least 10 to
one against abortion.
This is hi spite of a Harris Survey of April
1973 which showed that fully 53 percent of
the population favored the Supreme Court
decision!
Clearly it is a situation of almost complete
non-action on the part of the supporters of
legalized abortion. It is precisely this lack of
action which is going to allow the
anti-abortionist minority to force its opinion
upon every American woman.
Issue Extremely Emotional
The issue of abortion can be an extremely
emotional one, and the anti-abortionists have
exploited this to their utmost advantage. It
can only be countered by revealing the facts
about legalized abortion.
First of all, the risk of maternal death
from early legal abortion, during the first 12
weeks, is actually less than that from
pregnancy and childbirth (eight per 100,000
from abortion in the U.S., compared to
20-60 p6r 100,000 from pregnancy and
childbirth).
Furthermore, illegal abortions accounted
for the greatest single cause of maternal
deaths in California and New York, and these
abortion-related deaths have decreased by
more than 50 percent since abortion was
legalized in those states.
Fewer Welfare Births
Legalized abortion has also contributed
significantly to a decline in out-of-wedlock
births (iong associated with low birthweight

and higher infant mortali'ty), and a decrease
in the number of children born to welfare
families.
Unfortunately, the psychological stress
placed upon an unwanted child and his or her
mother cannot easily be quantified, but
observation shows such stress is significant.
On the other hand, studies done so far
suggest that legal abortion is usually
accompanied by few, if any, negative
psychological consequences.
Most Are Replacements
Probably the most important fact to note
is that legal abortions, contrary to common
belief, today are mostly replacements for
what would have been illegal ones.
A study done by the Biomedical Division
of the Population Council concluded that in
the time since abortion liberalization in New
York, seven of every 10 legal abortions
actually replaced illegal procedures.
The threat to the woman's right to make
her own decision about abortion is very real.
"Right to Life" groups are putting constant
pressure on Congressmen, and anti-abortion
amendments are continually being tacked
onto federal bills which have nothing to do
with abortion.
One-Sided View
Legislators are currently receiving an
almost exclusively one-sided view of the
opinions of their constituents. If those who
support legalized abortion continue to
remain silent, legislators will assume that
anti-abortion is the majority opinion, and we
will have effectively relinquished our
freedom of choice.
Action is imperative. Write your
Congressman and Senators immediately.

exploited this to their utmost advantage. It
can only be countered by revealing the facts
about legalized abortion.
First of all, the risk of maternal death
from early legal abortion, during the first 12
weeks, is actually less than that from
pregnancy and childbirth (eight per 100,000
from abortion in the U.S., compared to
20-60 p6r 100,000 from pregnancy and
childbirth).
Furthermore, illegal abortions accounted
for the greatest single cause of maternal
deaths in California and New York, and these
abortion-related deaths have decreased by
more than 50 percent since abortion was
legalized in those states.
Fewer Welfare Births
Legalized abortion has also contributed
significantly to a decline in out-of-wedlock
births (iong associated with low birthweight

and higher infant mortali'ty), and a decrease
in the number of children born to welfare
families.
Unfortunately, the psychological stress
placed upon an unwanted child and his or her
mother cannot easily be quantified, but
observation shows such stress is significant.
On the other hand, studies done so far
suggest that legal abortion is usually
accompanied by few, if any, negative
psychological consequences.
Most Are Replacements
Probably the most important fact to note
is that legal abortions, contrary to common
belief, today are mostly replacements for
what would have been illegal ones.
A study done by the Biomedical Division
of the Population Council concluded that in
the time since abortion liberalization in New
York, seven of every 10 legal abortions
actually replaced illegal procedures.
The threat to the woman's right to make
her own decision about abortion is very real.
"Right to Life" groups are putting constant
pressure on Congressmen, and anti-abortion
amendments are continually being tacked
onto federal bills which have nothing to do
with abortion.
One-Sided View
Legislators are currently receiving an
almost exclusively one-sided view of the
opinions of their constituents. If those who
support legalized abortion continue to
remain silent, legislators will assume that
anti-abortion is the majority opinion, and we
will have effectively relinquished our
freedom of choice.
Action is imperative. Write your
Congressman and Senators immediately.

As International Women's Day approaches
and the women and men of the Stanford
community are discussing feminism in all its
breadth, there are activities in our federal and
state legislatures that urgently require our
attention.
I am referring to the numerous
constitutional amendments currently under
consideration which would effectively repeal
or dilute the Supreme Court abortion
decision of January, 1973. There have
already been nearly 40 such amendments
introduced in Congress, and at least 12 states
have adopted resolutions supporting them.
The imminent danger to feminine freedom
of choice can hardly be exaggerated. The
amendments proposed have been of two
types: (1) to return the decision regarding
abortion to the states, or (2) to declare that
no state may deprive the fetus, from the
moment of conception, of life without due
process of law.
Would Nullify Decision
Either of these amendments would
completely nullify the Supreme Court
decision, and would again force women into
the jaws of illegal, criminal abortions.
The real political influence of the
supporters of these amendments is
frightening. Their spokesman is the national
Right to Life Committee, strongly backed by
the National Catholic Conference of Bishops.
They are an extremely well-organized and
well-financed lobby, and their tenacity is
astounding. They produce pamphlet after
pamphlet, illustrated with disintegrating
fetuses and packed with misinformation
about the safety and consequences of
abortion.
Vocal Following
And most importantly, their following is

extremely vocal. Day after day their letters
pour into Washington, with most
Congressmen's mail running at least 10 to
one against abortion.
This is hi spite of a Harris Survey of April
1973 which showed that fully 53 percent of
the population favored the Supreme Court
decision!
Clearly it is a situation of almost complete
non-action on the part of the supporters of
legalized abortion. It is precisely this lack of
action which is going to allow the
anti-abortionist minority to force its opinion
upon every American woman.

The issue of abortion can be an extremely
emotional one, and the anti-abortionists have
