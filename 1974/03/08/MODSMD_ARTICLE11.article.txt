# Pre-Meds And Liberal Education
## 
### 
Dennis Seymour

I have read John Siirila's letter
(Daily, March 5) several times in
utter amazement and still can't
believe what I am reading. In this
letter he is denouncing the
"pre-meds" and calling for a
return to a "liberal" education.
He introduces his letter saying
"The aim of, a liberal art
institution is to rid its students of
traditional ignorance and show
the methods intelligent people use
to control their lives. Stanford is
such an institution.
"However," he writes, the
"numbers |of pre-medical
students] are destroying the
character of the remaining
students," a non-sequitur to
which I object in three ways.
First, he assumes that pre-meds
are not receiving a "liberal arts
education," which I know not to
be the case from talking to many
pre-medical students.
Pre-Meds ignorant'?
Second, eve » if a pre-med is
not getting a liberal arts
education, how can Mr. Siirila
imply that they are "ignorant"
and can't "control their lives"?
Third, how can he say that
pre-meds are "destroying the
character of the remaining
students?" I doubt that the
character of non-pre-medical
Stanford students is so weak as to
be destroyed by a plethora of
pre-medical students.
The third paragraph is classic.
He writes that the pre-meds
"clamor for power, prestige, and
money. They fail to see science in
its true context. Actually, it is
relatively unimportant." Flow can
one categorize all pre-medical
students as wanting "power,
prestige, and money"?
'Craving Power'
That is like categorizing all
students of political science,
including John Siirila, as craving
for the power, prestige, and

money that accompany a lucrative
law or government position. (I
might add that I did not see any
doctors named in the recent
Watergate indictments; if I recall
correctly, all indicted were
lawyers and government
employees.)
Besides this, how can Siirila
dismiss the last three hundred
years of science as
"unimportant"?
Any student of history or
philosophy could tell you how
important science has been in the
shaping of the modern mentality,
a study which I am sure Siirila
would deem important in a liberal
arts education. Science has been
monumental in its influence on
Western civilization, and to
dismiss that influence is ludicrous.
Save Mankind
In the fourth paragraph Siirila
claims "Pre-meds profess they are
humanitarians trying to save
mankind from the scourge of
disease. ... If the intention of
the pre-med is to save the world,
he or she is in the wVong field."
Notice he makes statement
after writing that students
clamor for power, prestige, and
money."
What is the pre-med, a Faustus
or a Christ? I venture to say that
he is neither. I doubt that
pre-meds are either clamoring for
power, prestige, and money or
trying to save the world, an
impossible feat as we all know.
It seems that many pre-medical
students' attitudes are somewhat
in the middle — they are idealistic
and want to help people, but they
are also cognteant of the many
benefits which accompany the
practice of medicine.
See The Folly
Siirila ends his letter by writing
"any thoughtful person will see
the folly of those who restrict
their energy to one limited facet

of education. . . . We are supposed
to get a liberal education here." I
agree.
However, Siirila still has to
present some solid evidence that
pre-meds are not getting a liberal
education. Moreover, I argue that
many non-science students are
denying themselves a liberal
education.
By not taking science,
technology, and mathematics
courses, they are closing
themselves off from an important,
as well as interesting, component
of a truly liberal education,
whatever that nebulous,
American-pie-in-the-sky term
means.
It seems that too many
students I have encountered have

favored greatly a liberal education
except when it comes to
mathematics or science, which
they consider dull or too difficult.
Two Sides Of Coin
These students don't realize
what they are missing. There are
two sides to the coin, arts and
science, in the quest for a liberal
education.
In closing, all I ask of Siirila is
that he keep an open mind, refrain
from making such generalizations
about a group of students, and he
talk to as many pre-medical and
medical students as possible.
I think his attitudes will change
drastically.

impossible feat as we all know.
It seems that many pre-medical
students' attitudes are somewhat
in the middle — they are idealistic
and want to help people, but they
are also cognteant of the many
benefits which accompany the
practice of medicine.
See The Folly
Siirila ends his letter by writing
"any thoughtful person will see
the folly of those who restrict
their energy to one limited facet

of education. . . . We are supposed
to get a liberal education here." I
agree.
However, Siirila still has to
present some solid evidence that
pre-meds are not getting a liberal
education. Moreover, I argue that
many non-science students are
denying themselves a liberal
education.
By not taking science,
technology, and mathematics
courses, they are closing
themselves off from an important,
as well as interesting, component
of a truly liberal education,
whatever that nebulous,
American-pie-in-the-sky term
means.
It seems that too many
students I have encountered have

favored greatly a liberal education
except when it comes to
mathematics or science, which
they consider dull or too difficult.
Two Sides Of Coin
These students don't realize
what they are missing. There are
two sides to the coin, arts and
science, in the quest for a liberal
education.
In closing, all I ask of Siirila is
that he keep an open mind, refrain
from making such generalizations
about a group of students, and he
talk to as many pre-medical and
medical students as possible.
I think his attitudes will change
drastically.

I have read John Siirila's letter
(Daily, March 5) several times in
utter amazement and still can't
believe what I am reading. In this
letter he is denouncing the
"pre-meds" and calling for a
return to a "liberal" education.
He introduces his letter saying
"The aim of, a liberal art
institution is to rid its students of
traditional ignorance and show
the methods intelligent people use
to control their lives. Stanford is
such an institution.
"However," he writes, the
"numbers |of pre-medical
students] are destroying the
character of the remaining
students," a non-sequitur to
which I object in three ways.
First, he assumes that pre-meds
are not receiving a "liberal arts
education," which I know not to
be the case from talking to many
pre-medical students.
Pre-Meds ignorant'?
Second, eve » if a pre-med is
not getting a liberal arts
education, how can Mr. Siirila
imply that they are "ignorant"
and can't "control their lives"?
Third, how can he say that
pre-meds are "destroying the
character of the remaining
students?" I doubt that the
character of non-pre-medical
Stanford students is so weak as to
be destroyed by a plethora of
pre-medical students.
The third paragraph is classic.
He writes that the pre-meds
"clamor for power, prestige, and
money. They fail to see science in
its true context. Actually, it is
relatively unimportant." Flow can
one categorize all pre-medical
students as wanting "power,
prestige, and money"?
'Craving Power'
That is like categorizing all
students of political science,
including John Siirila, as craving
for the power, prestige, and

money that accompany a lucrative
law or government position. (I
might add that I did not see any
doctors named in the recent
Watergate indictments; if I recall
correctly, all indicted were
lawyers and government
employees.)
Besides this, how can Siirila
dismiss the last three hundred
years of science as
"unimportant"?
Any student of history or
philosophy could tell you how
important science has been in the
shaping of the modern mentality,
a study which I am sure Siirila
would deem important in a liberal
arts education. Science has been
monumental in its influence on
Western civilization, and to
dismiss that influence is ludicrous.
Save Mankind
In the fourth paragraph Siirila
claims "Pre-meds profess they are
humanitarians trying to save
mankind from the scourge of
disease. ... If the intention of
the pre-med is to save the world,
he or she is in the wVong field."
Notice he makes statement
after writing that students
clamor for power, prestige, and
money."
What is the pre-med, a Faustus
or a Christ? I venture to say that
he is neither. I doubt that
pre-meds are either clamoring for
power, prestige, and money or
trying to save the world, an
impossible feat as we all know.

"clamor for power, prestige, and
money. They fail to see science in
its true context. Actually, it is
relatively unimportant." Flow can
one categorize all pre-medical
students as wanting "power,
prestige, and money"?
'Craving Power'
That is like categorizing all
students of political science,
including John Siirila, as craving
for the power, prestige, and

money that accompany a lucrative
law or government position. (I
might add that I did not see any
doctors named in the recent
Watergate indictments; if I recall
correctly, all indicted were
lawyers and government
employees.)
Besides this, how can Siirila
dismiss the last three hundred
years of science as
"unimportant"?
Any student of history or
philosophy could tell you how
important science has been in the
shaping of the modern mentality,
a study which I am sure Siirila
would deem important in a liberal
arts education. Science has been
monumental in its influence on
Western civilization, and to
dismiss that influence is ludicrous.
Save Mankind
In the fourth paragraph Siirila
claims "Pre-meds profess they are
humanitarians trying to save
mankind from the scourge of
disease. ... If the intention of
the pre-med is to save the world,
he or she is in the wVong field."
Notice he makes statement
after writing that students
clamor for power, prestige, and
money."
What is the pre-med, a Faustus
or a Christ? I venture to say that
he is neither. I doubt that
pre-meds are either clamoring for
power, prestige, and money or
trying to save the world, an
impossible feat as we all know.
It seems that many pre-medical
students' attitudes are somewhat
in the middle — they are idealistic
and want to help people, but they
are also cognteant of the many
benefits which accompany the
practice of medicine.
See The Folly
Siirila ends his letter by writing
"any thoughtful person will see
the folly of those who restrict
their energy to one limited facet

of education. . . . We are supposed
to get a liberal education here." I
agree.
However, Siirila still has to
present some solid evidence that
pre-meds are not getting a liberal
education. Moreover, I argue that
many non-science students are
denying themselves a liberal
education.
By not taking science,
technology, and mathematics
courses, they are closing
themselves off from an important,
as well as interesting, component
of a truly liberal education,
whatever that nebulous,
American-pie-in-the-sky term
means.
It seems that too many
students I have encountered have

favored greatly a liberal education
except when it comes to
mathematics or science, which
they consider dull or too difficult.
Two Sides Of Coin
These students don't realize
what they are missing. There are
two sides to the coin, arts and
science, in the quest for a liberal
education.
In closing, all I ask of Siirila is
that he keep an open mind, refrain
from making such generalizations
about a group of students, and he
talk to as many pre-medical and
medical students as possible.
I think his attitudes will change
drastically.
