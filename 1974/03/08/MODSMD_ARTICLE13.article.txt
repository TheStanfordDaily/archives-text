# On Film Reviews

It seems apparent that neither
the press nor the film business
have given much serious thought
to their relationship. 1 review
movies because they represent to
me a microcosm of what modern
life is all about.
I think you can get a better
overview of where our whole
culture is right now from the
movies than from any other
medium this side of divine
revelation. Furthermore, you can
talk about the really "heavy"
topics of life more freely when
discussing them in the context of
movies than you can through
conventional contrivances of
conversation.
Many Courses
Many major universities,
including Stanford, have a wide
variety of courses on the movies â€”
studying everything from how to
make them to their cultural
impact. Yet the press, not
excluding the Daily, sees film as
almost exclusively an
entertainment medium, a means
of diversion.
Film reviews are always
relegated to the entertainment
pages, and then used only if there
is "room," the assumption being
that nobody really takes film
seriously. And of course there is
room only if there is enough
theater advertising to make an
extra page in the paper two or
three times a week.
That's how the press
misunderstands the movies, but
what's worse is how the movies
misunderstand the press.
Wanted Reviewer's Pass
The run-in was over whether I
would get a reviewer's pass to see
a particular new film. It seemed
obvious that the manager resented
the idea that the press was a
privileged segment of society that
had the audacity to call up and
ask for free passes.
His mistake, shared by many in
his position, I think, comes from
assuming we are such a privileged
class and therefore entitled to
deferential treatment. Maybe
around small-time politicians
members of the press deserve
honor based on their power and
influence, but there is not the
reasbn they should get passes to
the movies.
The reason ought to be that
press reviewers represent the
public which reads them, and
those readers have a right to
know, before plunking down their
three dollars, what a movie is
going to be like, and some clues to
what it is saying and how well it
speaks.
Role of Press
The role of the press ought to
be to communicate from those
who have something to offer the
public (the theaters, in this case)
to those who are looking for that
kind of commodity (the patrons
of films).
The theater manager who
thinks he is doing a reviewer a
favor by giving him a pass is just
as ignorant of the role of the
media as is the public official who
thinks he is giving the media a
break by calling a press
conference. Neither owes the ;
press a thing; both owe the public,
which gives them the approval
which lets them keep their jobs,
an accounting.
SWOPSI Course
My SWOPSI course,
"Movements and Minorities in the
Movies," has as its purpose
discovering how to view films
from a basis of ethnic,
philosophical and religious roots.
The thesis is that in addition to
"the" public served by the mass
media, there is also a Black public,
a Native American public, an
Asian public, a Jewish public, a
student public.
The course proposes to help
the students do for their own
ethnic group or movement what
my reviews attempt for the true
Christian minority.
This is a radical concept both
in society and the church itself,
which isn't quite ready to admit
being another minority within the
American way of life it has so
long tried to dominate.
Major Medium
I maintain that those whose
presuppositions are Biblical
deserve, at least every now and
then, to have someone looking at
film their way, and helping them
understand it as a major medium
affecting their lives, just as secular
humanists and pagans deserve and
now get film reviews from their
religious perspectives. And I think
the Daily is an appropriate
channel for such cultural
surveillance, for such Christians
are a major segment of its public.
