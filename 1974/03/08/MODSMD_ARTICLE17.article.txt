# King Donovan, Imogene Coca
## 'Prisoner' Lacks Spark 
### 
By GEORGE POWELL
CUPERTINO - What do The
Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
have in common with Neil
Simon's The Prisoner of Second
Avenue?
Appearing in all three, but in a
starring role Tuesday evening at
'Flint Center was King Donovan,
who just happens to be married to
lmogene Coca, the female lead in
the evening's stage production.
Coca, of course, is most
famous for her role in television
with Sid Ceasar on Your Show of
Shows, while Donovan has been
primarily a bit player in movies
and TV.
Surprisingly, though, Donovan
outshone his wife throughout the
rather leaden rendering of one of
Simon's less-funny plays. The
humorous lines were there, but
not delivered with the same style
and wit that marked other Simon
successes like Barefoot in the Park
and The Odd Couple.
One of the problems with The
Prisoner of Second Avenue is lack
of sustained physical excitement.
Although there are a couple of
sock-it-to-me type tricks with
pails of water, the entire play

seemed devoid of any physical
spark to compliment the oft-times
witty dialogue.
Donovan had most of the
witticisms, portraying Mel Edison,
a typical upper-middle-class New
Yorker who sees his city and
himself slowly declining into
insanity.
"The country's being buried in
garbage," he intones in the first
act, burdened by a serio-comic
angst that keeps him awake
nights.
As Mel's wife Edna, Coca has
little chance to use her
considerable physical comedic
talents, instead progressing from a
vacuous naivete into the stoical
crazy mental state of her husband.
Simon uses this device of the
wife following in her husband's
footsteps to make a variety of
comments on the problems,
foibles and complications of life
in New York City.
Mel and Edna's apartment is
robbed. Mel is fired from his job.
Edna goes to work to pay the
bills. Mel has a mental breakdown.
Both characters alternate
scenes of being incredibly uptight
with ones of resigned diffidence

to the situation. These
uptight/diffident confrontations
and one scene with three
god-awful actresses posing as Mel's
Jewish sisters provide all the
friction for biting commentary on
the New York scene.
From the play, it seems like
New Yorkers love to complain
about the city, but wouldn't live
anywhere else; hence the title,
Prisoner of Second Avenue. But
such a premise is a flimsy floor on
which to build a two-hour plus
comedy, and, unable to bear the
weight of the static structure, the
play collapses into a rubble of
boredom by the last half hour.
Although Donovan does by far
the best job with the material,
Coca seems unable to sustain any
emotion much longer than a Show
of Shows skit. On this particular
evening, her performance was
tired and lifeless, and for the
prices being charged, the audience
should have expected much more.
Although there may be other
technical and physical reasons
why touring companies are flat
some nights and vibrant the next,
it was quite enough to have
Simon's play imprisoned for only
one night in Cupertino.

New Yorkers love to complain
about the city, but wouldn't live
anywhere else; hence the title,
Prisoner of Second Avenue. But
such a premise is a flimsy floor on
which to build a two-hour plus
comedy, and, unable to bear the
weight of the static structure, the
play collapses into a rubble of
boredom by the last half hour.
Although Donovan does by far
the best job with the material,
Coca seems unable to sustain any
emotion much longer than a Show
of Shows skit. On this particular
evening, her performance was
tired and lifeless, and for the
prices being charged, the audience
should have expected much more.
Although there may be other
technical and physical reasons
why touring companies are flat
some nights and vibrant the next,
it was quite enough to have
Simon's play imprisoned for only
one night in Cupertino.

CUPERTINO - What do The
Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
have in common with Neil
Simon's The Prisoner of Second
Avenue?
Appearing in all three, but in a
starring role Tuesday evening at
'Flint Center was King Donovan,
who just happens to be married to
lmogene Coca, the female lead in
the evening's stage production.
Coca, of course, is most
famous for her role in television
with Sid Ceasar on Your Show of
Shows, while Donovan has been
primarily a bit player in movies
and TV.
Surprisingly, though, Donovan
outshone his wife throughout the
rather leaden rendering of one of
Simon's less-funny plays. The
humorous lines were there, but
not delivered with the same style
and wit that marked other Simon
successes like Barefoot in the Park
and The Odd Couple.
One of the problems with The
Prisoner of Second Avenue is lack
of sustained physical excitement.
Although there are a couple of
sock-it-to-me type tricks with
pails of water, the entire play

seemed devoid of any physical
spark to compliment the oft-times
witty dialogue.
Donovan had most of the
witticisms, portraying Mel Edison,
a typical upper-middle-class New
Yorker who sees his city and
himself slowly declining into
insanity.
"The country's being buried in
garbage," he intones in the first
act, burdened by a serio-comic
angst that keeps him awake
nights.
As Mel's wife Edna, Coca has
little chance to use her
considerable physical comedic
talents, instead progressing from a
vacuous naivete into the stoical
crazy mental state of her husband.
Simon uses this device of the
wife following in her husband's
footsteps to make a variety of
comments on the problems,
foibles and complications of life
in New York City.
Mel and Edna's apartment is
robbed. Mel is fired from his job.
Edna goes to work to pay the
bills. Mel has a mental breakdown.
Both characters alternate
scenes of being incredibly uptight
with ones of resigned diffidence

to the situation. These
uptight/diffident confrontations
and one scene with three
god-awful actresses posing as Mel's
Jewish sisters provide all the
friction for biting commentary on
the New York scene.
