# Marxist Sees Feminist Society
## Marcuse Cites Radical Movement 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
The women's liberation movement
is "perhaps the most important and
potentially the most radical political
movement we have, even if
consciousness of that fact has not
penetrated the movement as a whole,"
Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse
said yesterday.
"Achieving the liberation of women
will be a painful process, but it is a
vital stage in the transition to a better
society for men and women," he said.
Marcuse, 75, a professor of
philosophy at the University of
California at San Diego, lectured on
"Marxism and Feminism" to a
Memorial Auditorium audience of
1500. His appearance was sponsored
by the Center for Research on Women
as part of this week's Women's Day
Fair.
"Many feminine characteristics are
socially conditioned," Marcuse noted.
"However, the effects of thousands of

years of male domination cannot be
changed merely by the establishment
of alternative institutions. The goals of
the women's movement require
changes of such enormity, in material
as well as intellectual culture, that
they can be obtained only by virtue of
a change in the entire social system."
The "first level" of women's
liberation, Marcuse said, is "the
struggle for full economic, social and
cultural equality. I can see no
economic reasons why this goal should
not be achieved within a capitalist
framework —but within a greatly
modified capitalist framework."
Freudian Concept
Referring to the Freudian concept
of a "reality principle" — the sum of
society's constraints and influences on
individual behavior — the Berlin-born
philosopher outlined a second level of
the women's movement.
This level, he said, "transcends the
first, inasmuch as the liberation of

women implies the construction of a
society governed by a different reality
principle — a society where the
established dichotomy between men
and women is overcome in social and
individual relationships between
human beings."
"Thus within the movement itself is
contained the image not only of new
social institutions, but the image of a
new society," he added.
"This," Marcuse said, "means not
only a commitment to socialism, but
also to a specific form of socialism"—
"feminist socialism."
Surplus Aggression
"Patriarchal civilization," he said,
uses "governing values" of
productivity, "functional rationality,"
the work ethic, and the will to power
as repressive mechanisms which
activate and channel "surplus
aggression" in directions useful to the
established order.
"Socialism must embody the
antithesis of the aggressive and
repressive needs and values of
capitalist society as a form of
male-dominated culture," Marcuse
continued.
The "maturing" of economic
conditions, he said, has enabled the
ascent of characterises like
receptivity, sensitivity, non-violence
and tenderness which "have been
attributed to the female and not to the
male.
"These characteristics appear as the
opposite of domination and
exploitation. On the psychological
level, they pertain to the domain of
Eros, the life instinct, as opposed to
the death and aggressive instincts."
A socialist society, he said, would
"universalize" the best "feminine"
characteristics.
Liberation, he concluded, "must
emerge in individuals. The liberation
of women begins at home, before it
can enter the society at large." In what
he called "a personal note," Marcuse
said "We must pay for the sins of
patriarchal civilization, and for our
tyranny of power."
