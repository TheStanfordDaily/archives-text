# Nevelson Finds 'New Image' In Wood
## 
### KARIN MUELLO 
SAN FRANCISCO - Her
hands are the blunt articulate
hands of a laborer, and when she
is not using them to explain an
idea, Louise Nevelson gently
smooths the veined fingers and
calloused palms. Fifty years of
painting and sculpture have gone
into the shaping of those hands.
You can watch Louise
Nevelson's articulate hands reflect
on her work in a taped interview
shown every hour at the San
Francisco Art Museum. It's all
part of the retrospective exhibit
of Nevelson's wood scultpures on
view through Sunday.
"Why wood?" she is asked,
"when so many contemporary
artists were experimenting with
the metal and plastics of Pop Art
suburbia?"
"Because it's so immediate,"
she answers. "I can complete a
thought and see its effect
immediately. Living so changes a
person from day to day; any
longer process would jumble my
first intent."
'New Relationships'
Nevelson has been working in
wood since 1940. The process is
peculiarly her own — "the art of
fitting together parts and pieces,"
she explains, to make new
relationships between familiar
objects.

She is a well-known sight
around her New York
neighborhood, scrounging odd
chunks of wood, cast-off
balustrades, used shipping crates.
These and other treasures she
brings home to her studio to fit
together in patterns within boxes
or shallow frames.
She then paints the whole,
usually black, sometimes white,
rarely gold, to neutralize and
integrate the found objects in
their new framework.
"These are not recognizable
objects to me once I finish," she
says in the interview. Each
element is fundamentally changed
through its relationships with the
other elements. For us, the
finished effect is like being let
loose to rummage through an attic
full of old trunks and forgotten
bric-a-brac.
Organizing Clutter
The titles of the pieces are
important. They provide a
direction for approaching, a
pattern for organizing the clutter
of information in each work.
"I want things to relate to us,"
says Nevelson. After taking those

ingredients she wants from the
world, stripping them of their old
associations and organizing them
into new patterns, she gives them
back to us with her stamp on
them. The title is our password.
Night Music, Dawn's Wedding
Chapel I, Young Shadows,
Tropical Garden 1, Tide I Tide —
each title sets up a mysterious
new chain of associations that
animates her sculptures.
Each piece is alive with
textures, shadows, shapes. A
strong sense of shape is evident
even in the earlier line drawings
Nevelson did under Hans Hoffman
and Diego Rivera in the 20s, and
the cubist terra-cotta sculptures
she tried in the 30s. When
Nevelson started using boxes and
shallow frames as settings for her
found objects, she added textures
of light and shadows to the
shapes.
Space Expands
Space — its creation and
definition — is the most exciting
quality to emerge in her work of
the last 30 years. Beginning with
table-top size "landscapes" —
selected and arranged wooden

objects such as chair backs,
carpenter's lathes, newel posts —
Nevelson's use of space expands
out and up.
Objects are crammed into
intriguing "Dream Houses," nailed
onto shallow hanging reliefs, shot
straight upwards in tall spiky
columns, totems, personnages.
In the 50s Nevelson began
organizing separate boxes and
columns into entire walls. They're
big — 9 feet high, 6 to 18 feet
wide.
These walls are the most
absorbing pieces of the exhibit.
They are invitations to enter
another new space. Through their
sheer expanse, Nevelson's walls
reach out to engulf you in her
inner space people with
transformed yet familiar objects.
It's like looking into the minds's
compartments.
An irresistable feeling of
rhythm exudes from her pieces of
the 60s, especially when Nevelson
begins to use standardized prefab
boxes to arrange her walls in
symmetrical grids. By picking up
and repeating the object
relationships in one box

throughout a wall, as in Night
Focus Dawn, Nevelson creates
moving rhythmic patterns for the
eye.
Clattering Computer
Sometimes these patterns
frighten, as in her Endof-Day
Nightscapes, where shafts of wood
jut out of the intensely fine grid
of type-setter's cases, like so much
clattering information from a
computer.
The art of assembling and
transforming information which
characterizes her work makes
Nevelson much more a/: architect
than a sculptor. "An architect of
shadows ... an architect of
reflections," she has called herself.
"My total conscious search in
life has been for a new seeing, a
new image, a new insight. This
search not only includes the
object, but the in-between places,
the dawns and the dusks, the
objective world, the heavenly
spheres, the places between the
land and the sea. ..."
Her sculptures absorb us
because they are those mysterious
in-between places. Half-forgotten,
half-remembered, they take us in.

It's like looking into the minds's
compartments.
An irresistable feeling of
rhythm exudes from her pieces of
the 60s, especially when Nevelson
begins to use standardized prefab
boxes to arrange her walls in
symmetrical grids. By picking up
and repeating the object
relationships in one box

throughout a wall, as in Night
Focus Dawn, Nevelson creates
moving rhythmic patterns for the
eye.
Clattering Computer
Sometimes these patterns
frighten, as in her Endof-Day
Nightscapes, where shafts of wood
jut out of the intensely fine grid
of type-setter's cases, like so much
clattering information from a
computer.
The art of assembling and
transforming information which
characterizes her work makes
Nevelson much more a/: architect
than a sculptor. "An architect of
shadows ... an architect of
reflections," she has called herself.
"My total conscious search in
life has been for a new seeing, a
new image, a new insight. This
search not only includes the
object, but the in-between places,
the dawns and the dusks, the
objective world, the heavenly
spheres, the places between the
land and the sea. ..."
Her sculptures absorb us
because they are those mysterious
in-between places. Half-forgotten,
half-remembered, they take us in.


ARCHITECT OF SHADOWS—Sculptor-painter Louise Nevelson
dresses in tapestry and fur as part of her commitment to texture. Her
wood scultpures, fashioned from scraps and packing boxes, are on
display at the San Francisco Museum of Art through Sunday. This
show includes a videotape interview with the artist.
SAN FRANCISCO - Her
hands are the blunt articulate
hands of a laborer, and when she
is not using them to explain an
idea, Louise Nevelson gently
smooths the veined fingers and
calloused palms. Fifty years of
painting and sculpture have gone
into the shaping of those hands.
You can watch Louise
Nevelson's articulate hands reflect
on her work in a taped interview
shown every hour at the San
Francisco Art Museum. It's all
part of the retrospective exhibit
of Nevelson's wood scultpures on
view through Sunday.
"Why wood?" she is asked,
"when so many contemporary
artists were experimenting with
the metal and plastics of Pop Art
suburbia?"
"Because it's so immediate,"
she answers. "I can complete a
thought and see its effect
immediately. Living so changes a
person from day to day; any
longer process would jumble my
first intent."
'New Relationships'
Nevelson has been working in
wood since 1940. The process is
peculiarly her own — "the art of
fitting together parts and pieces,"
she explains, to make new
relationships between familiar
objects.

She is a well-known sight
around her New York
neighborhood, scrounging odd
chunks of wood, cast-off
balustrades, used shipping crates.
These and other treasures she
brings home to her studio to fit
together in patterns within boxes
or shallow frames.
She then paints the whole,
usually black, sometimes white,
rarely gold, to neutralize and
integrate the found objects in
their new framework.
"These are not recognizable
objects to me once I finish," she
says in the interview. Each
element is fundamentally changed
through its relationships with the
other elements. For us, the
finished effect is like being let
loose to rummage through an attic
full of old trunks and forgotten
bric-a-brac.
Organizing Clutter
The titles of the pieces are
important. They provide a
direction for approaching, a
pattern for organizing the clutter
of information in each work.
"I want things to relate to us,"
says Nevelson. After taking those

ingredients she wants from the
world, stripping them of their old
associations and organizing them
into new patterns, she gives them
back to us with her stamp on
them. The title is our password.
Night Music, Dawn's Wedding
Chapel I, Young Shadows,
Tropical Garden 1, Tide I Tide —
each title sets up a mysterious
new chain of associations that
animates her sculptures.
Each piece is alive with
textures, shadows, shapes. A
strong sense of shape is evident
even in the earlier line drawings
Nevelson did under Hans Hoffman
and Diego Rivera in the 20s, and
the cubist terra-cotta sculptures
she tried in the 30s. When
Nevelson started using boxes and
shallow frames as settings for her
found objects, she added textures
of light and shadows to the
shapes.
Space Expands
Space — its creation and
definition — is the most exciting
quality to emerge in her work of
the last 30 years. Beginning with
table-top size "landscapes" —
selected and arranged wooden

objects such as chair backs,
carpenter's lathes, newel posts —
Nevelson's use of space expands
out and up.
Objects are crammed into
intriguing "Dream Houses," nailed
onto shallow hanging reliefs, shot
straight upwards in tall spiky
columns, totems, personnages.
In the 50s Nevelson began
organizing separate boxes and
columns into entire walls. They're
big — 9 feet high, 6 to 18 feet
wide.
These walls are the most
absorbing pieces of the exhibit.
They are invitations to enter
another new space. Through their
sheer expanse, Nevelson's walls
reach out to engulf you in her
inner space people with
transformed yet familiar objects.

Night Music, Dawn's Wedding
Chapel I, Young Shadows,
Tropical Garden 1, Tide I Tide —
each title sets up a mysterious
new chain of associations that
animates her sculptures.
Each piece is alive with
textures, shadows, shapes. A
strong sense of shape is evident
even in the earlier line drawings
Nevelson did under Hans Hoffman
and Diego Rivera in the 20s, and
the cubist terra-cotta sculptures
she tried in the 30s. When
Nevelson started using boxes and
shallow frames as settings for her
found objects, she added textures
of light and shadows to the
shapes.
Space Expands
Space — its creation and
definition — is the most exciting
quality to emerge in her work of
the last 30 years. Beginning with
table-top size "landscapes" —
selected and arranged wooden

objects such as chair backs,
carpenter's lathes, newel posts —
Nevelson's use of space expands
out and up.
Objects are crammed into
intriguing "Dream Houses," nailed
onto shallow hanging reliefs, shot
straight upwards in tall spiky
columns, totems, personnages.
In the 50s Nevelson began
organizing separate boxes and
columns into entire walls. They're
big — 9 feet high, 6 to 18 feet
wide.
These walls are the most
absorbing pieces of the exhibit.
They are invitations to enter
another new space. Through their
sheer expanse, Nevelson's walls
reach out to engulf you in her
inner space people with
transformed yet familiar objects.
It's like looking into the minds's
compartments.
An irresistable feeling of
rhythm exudes from her pieces of
the 60s, especially when Nevelson
begins to use standardized prefab
boxes to arrange her walls in
symmetrical grids. By picking up
and repeating the object
relationships in one box

throughout a wall, as in Night
Focus Dawn, Nevelson creates
moving rhythmic patterns for the
eye.
Clattering Computer
Sometimes these patterns
frighten, as in her Endof-Day
Nightscapes, where shafts of wood
jut out of the intensely fine grid
of type-setter's cases, like so much
clattering information from a
computer.
The art of assembling and
transforming information which
characterizes her work makes
Nevelson much more a/: architect
than a sculptor. "An architect of
shadows ... an architect of
reflections," she has called herself.
"My total conscious search in
life has been for a new seeing, a
new image, a new insight. This
search not only includes the
object, but the in-between places,
the dawns and the dusks, the
objective world, the heavenly
spheres, the places between the
land and the sea. ..."
Her sculptures absorb us
because they are those mysterious
in-between places. Half-forgotten,
half-remembered, they take us in.


ARCHITECT OF SHADOWS—Sculptor-painter Louise Nevelson
dresses in tapestry and fur as part of her commitment to texture. Her
wood scultpures, fashioned from scraps and packing boxes, are on
display at the San Francisco Museum of Art through Sunday. This
show includes a videotape interview with the artist.
SAN FRANCISCO - Her
hands are the blunt articulate
hands of a laborer, and when she
is not using them to explain an
idea, Louise Nevelson gently
smooths the veined fingers and
calloused palms. Fifty years of
painting and sculpture have gone
into the shaping of those hands.
You can watch Louise
Nevelson's articulate hands reflect
on her work in a taped interview
shown every hour at the San
Francisco Art Museum. It's all
part of the retrospective exhibit
of Nevelson's wood scultpures on
view through Sunday.
"Why wood?" she is asked,
"when so many contemporary
artists were experimenting with
the metal and plastics of Pop Art
suburbia?"
"Because it's so immediate,"
she answers. "I can complete a
thought and see its effect
immediately. Living so changes a
person from day to day; any
longer process would jumble my
first intent."
'New Relationships'
Nevelson has been working in
wood since 1940. The process is
peculiarly her own — "the art of
fitting together parts and pieces,"
she explains, to make new
relationships between familiar
objects.

She is a well-known sight
around her New York
neighborhood, scrounging odd
chunks of wood, cast-off
balustrades, used shipping crates.
These and other treasures she
brings home to her studio to fit
together in patterns within boxes
or shallow frames.
She then paints the whole,
usually black, sometimes white,
rarely gold, to neutralize and
integrate the found objects in
their new framework.
"These are not recognizable
objects to me once I finish," she
says in the interview. Each
element is fundamentally changed
through its relationships with the
other elements. For us, the
finished effect is like being let
loose to rummage through an attic
full of old trunks and forgotten
bric-a-brac.
Organizing Clutter
The titles of the pieces are
important. They provide a
direction for approaching, a
pattern for organizing the clutter
of information in each work.
"I want things to relate to us,"
says Nevelson. After taking those

ingredients she wants from the
world, stripping them of their old
associations and organizing them
into new patterns, she gives them
back to us with her stamp on
them. The title is our password.
