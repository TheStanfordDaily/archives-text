# American Ballet Theatre
## Russian Makarova Disappoints 
### JOY WESTON 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” The American Ballet
Theatre's Monday night performance at the
War Memorial Opera House was a pleasing
display of the Company's combination of
verve and technical brilHance.
Unfortunately, the guest appearance of
Russian Ballerina Natalia Makarova was not
what it could have been. Her role as Caroline
in Antony Tudor's Jardin aux Lilas gave her
little room for more than some expressive
romantic drama, and her solo as Terpsichore
in Balanchine's Apollo was appealing but not
great.
Certainly Makarova's coming performance
as Odette-Odile in Swan Lake on Thursday
and as Princess Aurora in The Sleeping
Beauty next Tuesday will give her an
opportunity to show her undoubted
expertise.
Laurels for the evening went to Cynthia
Gregory and Ted Kivitt in Grand Pas
Classique. The choreography by Victor
Gsovsky allowed both dancers to
demonstrate their considerable skills.
Ease, Bravura
Gregory, lovely in every limb, executed
her part with ease and bravura. Kivitt, known
for his technical brilliance, showed us just
that; he was supportive yet strong in the pas
de deux and excellent in his solo. His
elevation is particularly impressive, and
together the two did wonderful work which

both they and the audience thoroughly
enjoyed.
The second high spot of the evening was
Harold Lander's Etudes. This ballet
"illustrates the complete development of
classical ballet from the basic five positions
to pure virtuosity."
Starting with the appealing demonstration
by five baby ballerinas (ages 3 to 9,
probably) of the five ballet positions, the
piece builds nicely, both musically and
choreographically, through the barre work,
which was cleverly lighted and impeccably
performed by the full corps.
Next came the center work, and finally
demonstrations of ballet's most difficult
steps, turns, and leaps.
Particularly outstanding were Eleanor
D'Antuono, as the prima ballerina, and
Fernando Bujones, who, with Jonas Kage,
danced the male soloist roles.
Amazing Turns
D'Antuono, petitte and sprightly, was
most effective in her multiple pirouettes and
in her lightening grand jettes. Bujones, a
small, lithe dancer, was simply brilliant. His
turns were amazingly accurate and numerous,
and his elevation incredible.
By contrast, Jonas Kage, who also played
the lead in the opening piece, Apollo, seemed
regrettably earth-bound, especially for a god.
Although he looks the role, and though his
use of arms was effective, on the whole he
was not up to the part.

Apollo, in fact, despite some interesting
Balanchine choreography, was a
disappointment. Although there were some
nice moments between Apollo and his three
muses (such as the ballerinas' unusual
successive low-level turns, the solos were not
particularly inspired, and the piece fell rather
flat.
The show was soon revived by the Grand
Pas Classique, but all too soon let down again
by Jardin aux Lilas. This ultra-romantic
ballet is based on an intricate tangle of
relationships revealed at a garden party.
Unhappy 'Jardin'
First presented in 1938, it is more of an
historical curiosity than a solid piece of
choreography. Inconclusive and diffuse, the
movement followsone couple after another as
they demonstrate their unhappy love. The
long skirts of the ladies were rather
detrimental to the line, and despite
competent performances by Bujones and
Bonnie Mathis, Jardin was quite
uninteresting.
The final piece, Etudes, with its
culmination in a full-force, full company
finale, was a vigorous conclusion. The low
spots of the evening were due more to
uninspired choreography than to any lapse in
technique.
Indeed, except for Kage's lack of energy
in Apollo, the dancing was excellent
throughout. The high spots, when they came,
made for a memorable performance.
