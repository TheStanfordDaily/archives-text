# Musselwhite Pleases Large Blues Crowd
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Monday night "The History of
the Blues" presented its third live
blues program of the quarter, with
blues harpist Charlie Musselwhite.
An audience of almost 200
crowded Tresidder Union's small
lounge to hear an informal
sampling of tunes by one of the
most gifted contemporary blues
harmonica players.
Musselwhite performed many
songs from his regular repertoire
spanning six LPs, accompanied
only by guitarist Tim Kaihatsu
who appears on three of those
LPs. Mussel white's usual line-up
includes guitar, piano, bass and
drums.
The two schools of
contemporary' blues harp align
themselves with the late Little
Walter Jacobs and the late Sonny
Boy Williamson. Musselwhite
exhibited proficiency at both
styles, starting with Little Walter's
"Everything's Gonna Be Alright"
and "Everybody Needs
Somebody," and also including
Sonny Boy's slow "Decoration
Day"and the classic "Help Me."
Accustomed to playing for
drinking, dancing, hollering
audiences in bars and dance halls,
Musselwhite was somewhat
apprehensive at first to be playing
for a group that was interested in
listening.
After playing about five
numbers and taking a short break,
he was visibly looser in the second
half, later noting that he was
"very impressed with the
audience. They were really

listening hard, concentrating,
wanting to hear the blues."
Kaihatsu, playing a Fender
Telecaster through an amplifier at
low volume, was originally a
folk-type guitarist before joining
Musselwhite. He seemed more at
home playing John Lee Hooker
and Muddy Waters style back-up
Monday night than he does when
playing single-note lead breaks
with the full band.
Musselwhite gave the audience
a rare treat by playing a little
guitar himself. He is a very
talented slide guitarist, but
unfortunately was playing a
borrowed guitar which he was not
comfortable with, and quit after
one tune.
Musselwhite sings in such a soft
voice, almost a whisper, that it
was necessary for him to sing
through the amplifier to be heard.
Although he just recently
turned 30, Musselwhite plays and
sings with the authority one
would expect from a much older,
more established bluesman such as
Muddy Waters.
This is reflective of his long
association with numerous
bluesmen in both Chicago and
Memphis.
Musselwhite said he is looking
forward to returning next quarter.

lounge to hear an informal
sampling of tunes by one of the
most gifted contemporary blues
harmonica players.
Musselwhite performed many
songs from his regular repertoire
spanning six LPs, accompanied
only by guitarist Tim Kaihatsu
who appears on three of those
LPs. Mussel white's usual line-up
includes guitar, piano, bass and
drums.
The two schools of
contemporary' blues harp align
themselves with the late Little
Walter Jacobs and the late Sonny
Boy Williamson. Musselwhite
exhibited proficiency at both
styles, starting with Little Walter's
"Everything's Gonna Be Alright"
and "Everybody Needs
Somebody," and also including
Sonny Boy's slow "Decoration
Day"and the classic "Help Me."
Accustomed to playing for
drinking, dancing, hollering
audiences in bars and dance halls,
Musselwhite was somewhat
apprehensive at first to be playing
for a group that was interested in
listening.
After playing about five
numbers and taking a short break,
he was visibly looser in the second
half, later noting that he was
"very impressed with the
audience. They were really

listening hard, concentrating,
wanting to hear the blues."
Kaihatsu, playing a Fender
Telecaster through an amplifier at
low volume, was originally a
folk-type guitarist before joining
Musselwhite. He seemed more at
home playing John Lee Hooker
and Muddy Waters style back-up
Monday night than he does when
playing single-note lead breaks
with the full band.
Musselwhite gave the audience
a rare treat by playing a little
guitar himself. He is a very
talented slide guitarist, but
unfortunately was playing a
borrowed guitar which he was not
comfortable with, and quit after
one tune.
Musselwhite sings in such a soft
voice, almost a whisper, that it
was necessary for him to sing
through the amplifier to be heard.
Although he just recently
turned 30, Musselwhite plays and
sings with the authority one
would expect from a much older,
more established bluesman such as
Muddy Waters.
This is reflective of his long
association with numerous
bluesmen in both Chicago and
Memphis.
Musselwhite said he is looking
forward to returning next quarter.
