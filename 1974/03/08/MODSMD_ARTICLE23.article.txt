# Cards Hope To Regain Scrum Axe
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The Stanford rugby team will
try to regain possession of the
"Big Scrum Axe" tomorrow at
1:30 p.m., when the Cards meet
California in Memorial Coliseum
at Berkeley.
Cal, 6-2 for the season,
dropped its first game, and then
went on to win six straight before
losing 22-3 to Sydney University.
The Bears also beat USC, while
Stanford could only manage to tie
the Trojans 10-10 last week.
Trojan head coach John Petri 11,
however, was unimpressed by the
Bears. "Stanford should really
give Cal a hard time," he said.
The Cards have been missing
several close scoring
opportunities, and three
consecutive losses have dropped
their record to 4-3-1. "We just
played some better teams in those
three losses," coach Pete
Kmetovic explained, "but that
USC tie was a game we should
have won."
Kmetovic has a definite
formula for a Cardinal victory
tomorrow. "We're going to have
to pass a lot better and hope some
of those near misses become
tries," he said. "We also can't miss
easy penalty kicks."
Stanford will be playing
without the services of Forrie
Martin and Jack Schultz, both of
whom are out with injuries, so the
Card defense will have a tough
time containing the explosive
Bears. Cal scored 22 points against
USC, and put three points on the
board against the Sydney team
which shut the Cards out.
Stanford hopes to rekindle its
lost offense, as the Monterey
Tournament approaches in two
weeks. "With 32 teams in the
tourney it will be a real struggle,"
Kmetovic said. "We've got to start
some offense against Cal and hope
that it carries over to the
tournament."
