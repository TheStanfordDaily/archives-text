# Stanford Meets San Jose State
## Track Record In Jeopardy 
### MARK WHITE 
Weakened by injuries and
hampered by lack of depth in the
field events, Stanford's track team
will put its perfect 1-0 dual meet
record on the line and in serious
jeopardy tomorrow when theCards
meet San Jose State at 11 a.m. on
the Bud Spencer Memorial Held
in San Jose.
Considered one of the nation's
powerhouse track contingents, the
Spartan team should have few
problems duplicating last year's
87-58 victory over the Cards.
While early season injuries and
graduations have made Stanford
weaker, San Jose has grown

stronger since 1973 through
seasoning and recruiting.
"In the last six years Stanford
has had some down years, but this
year Payton Jordan [Stanford
track coach] has a real challenge
on his hands," said San Jose State
coach Ernießullard. "Injuries and
the loss of |shotputtci' Terry]
Albritton have really hurt them.
"On paper we're stronger and
we should do well if we compete
like we did last year. But we can't
lie back and relax; Payton is a real
competitor and he'll have his team
ready to make it a traditionally
competitive Stanford-San Jose
State meet.
"We feel our strength is on the
track — in all areas — because we
have strength and depth in most
events. Our jumps are good, but
we do have some depth problems.
We are weak in the weight events,
but that won't hurt us too much
against Stanford because they're
even weaker."
Ron Whittaker is one reason
the Spartans are so strong on the
track. Last year Whittaker won
the prep state 440 title in 47.0,
went undefeated in 100 and 220

competition in dual meets and has
turned a 45.2 on a mile relay leg.
Whittaker is injured and won't
compete this week, but behind
him is junior Ton* Briddel, a
Spartan who went undefeated in
the 220 during dual meets last
year. Briddel, who was fourth in
the NCAA 220 finals last year, is a
consistent 9.4 hundred and 20.9
220 sprinter. "They are two
outstanding sprinters"Bullardsaid.
Middle distance ace Mark
Schilling leads a talented corps of
Spartan distance runners
seasoned in international
competition. Schilling was sixth in
the NCAA mile last year at
3:58.6, and won the World Games
880 title last year at 1:50.6. Glen
Hearnatz is j another half-miler
with impressive international
credentials; he was Maccabeah
Games champion in the 800
meters at 1:50.3.
One of the best matchups of
the meet will be in the 120 high
hurdles when Stanford's
undefeated Dave Bagshaw, who
has run 14.0, faces SJS's Greg
Tinnin. Tinnin was a finalist in the
NCAA's last year, running 13.6.

Ron Whittaker is one reason
the Spartans are so strong on the
track. Last year Whittaker won
the prep state 440 title in 47.0,
went undefeated in 100 and 220

competition in dual meets and has
turned a 45.2 on a mile relay leg.
Whittaker is injured and won't
compete this week, but behind
him is junior Ton* Briddel, a
Spartan who went undefeated in
the 220 during dual meets last
year. Briddel, who was fourth in
the NCAA 220 finals last year, is a
consistent 9.4 hundred and 20.9
220 sprinter. "They are two
outstanding sprinters"Bullardsaid.
Middle distance ace Mark
Schilling leads a talented corps of
Spartan distance runners
seasoned in international
competition. Schilling was sixth in
the NCAA mile last year at
3:58.6, and won the World Games
880 title last year at 1:50.6. Glen
Hearnatz is j another half-miler
with impressive international
credentials; he was Maccabeah
Games champion in the 800
meters at 1:50.3.
One of the best matchups of
the meet will be in the 120 high
hurdles when Stanford's
undefeated Dave Bagshaw, who
has run 14.0, faces SJS's Greg
Tinnin. Tinnin was a finalist in the
NCAA's last year, running 13.6.

SCRUM AXE AT STAKE—The rugby action should be typically intense tomorrow as Stanford meets
California for the "Big Scrum Axe ' at 12:30 p.m. in Berkeley. Above, Stanford and Sydney University
players battle for the ball in a game two weeks ago.
Weakened by injuries and
hampered by lack of depth in the
field events, Stanford's track team
will put its perfect 1-0 dual meet
record on the line and in serious
jeopardy tomorrow when theCards
meet San Jose State at 11 a.m. on
the Bud Spencer Memorial Held
in San Jose.
Considered one of the nation's
powerhouse track contingents, the
Spartan team should have few
problems duplicating last year's
87-58 victory over the Cards.
While early season injuries and
graduations have made Stanford
weaker, San Jose has grown

stronger since 1973 through
seasoning and recruiting.
"In the last six years Stanford
has had some down years, but this
year Payton Jordan [Stanford
track coach] has a real challenge
on his hands," said San Jose State
coach Ernießullard. "Injuries and
the loss of |shotputtci' Terry]
Albritton have really hurt them.
"On paper we're stronger and
we should do well if we compete
like we did last year. But we can't
lie back and relax; Payton is a real
competitor and he'll have his team
ready to make it a traditionally
competitive Stanford-San Jose
State meet.
"We feel our strength is on the
track — in all areas — because we
have strength and depth in most
events. Our jumps are good, but
we do have some depth problems.
We are weak in the weight events,
but that won't hurt us too much
against Stanford because they're
even weaker."
