## The 						Nuances Of No-Ad 
### Vlae Kershner 
Last year at this time, the possibility of a drastic
change in collegiate tennis rules seemed as
farfetched as gasoline rationing. But, to most
everyone's surprise, the NCAA moguls decided to
throw out all that 15, 30, 40 deuce, ad
gobbledygook they figured had been cluttering up
the game for years. The result was no-ad scoring.
So, if you venture over to the Varsity Courts
some afternoon, you'll see the new system being
played, even in practice. Unfortunately, perhaps,
no-ad seems quarantined to those courts, as few
other players around here use it.
Here's a brief description of no-ad. The first
player to win four points wins each game. Points
are counted in what is a revolutionary manner for
the staid game of lawn tennis — love, one, two,
three, four. If the score is tied at three-all, the
receiver has the right to choose which court he'll
return service in for the seventh and deciding point.
According to members of Stanford's tennis
team, no-ad scoring has its advantages and
disadvantages.
Aids Scheduling
One of the things coach Dick Gould likes about
no-ad is that it greatly aids scheduling matches.
This speed-up of play is especially important in
college tennis, where one player frequently must
play both a singles and a doubles match in the
limited time between the beginning of the match
and nightfall.
Another advantage is that both in-person crowds
and TV audiences like to see many different players
perform for a shorter period of time each. As tennis
rapidly becomes a mass audience sport, what the
crowd wants becomes more and more important to
promoters, players and others who have a financial
interest in the sport.
Finally, some players, such as Mark Mitchell,
like playing under the pressure of no-ad, and figure
that the new system is to the advantage of
the player who can avoidchoking on key points.
On the other hand, Chip Fisher, a tennis writer

as well as player, laments some of the changes that
no-ad has brought about.
'Flqualizer'
"It's an equalizer," Fisher says. In other words,
the weaker player has a better chance of winning
each game when he's playing no-ad and only has to
win one point instead of two-in-a-row.
Also, according to Fisher, no-ad, by speeding up
play (sets are rarely longer than a half hour)
lessens the need for players to be in good physical
condition.
A final possible disadvantage is that no-ad
scoring generally hurts servers and specifically hurts
those players who serve better to one side of the
court than the other.
Like it or not, if no-ad scoring works well in its
trial this year, chances are good that pretty soon it
will be as universally used as that amazing invention
of a few seasons ago — the tiebreaker.
You'll Be Playing
So its a pretty good bet that sooner or later
you'll be playing no-ad. And knowing the
intricacies of the system could put you at a great
advantage.
For example, suppose you're waiting for a court,
and you're too polite to tell the people on court
three that their hour is up and if they don't get off
soon you'll bash their heads in with your racket.
Just tell them to play no-ad, and that last
interminable set will soon be over.
Or suppose you've always wanted to play mixed
doubles with a person who couldn't return a
beachball. Now you can invite him or her to play
with you, only making sure that you get to return
all the seventh points. If you win all your returns,
you can win the game no matter how
uncoordinated your partner.
I enjoyed no-ad when I first played it a couple
weeks ago, and I recommend that everyone at least
try it. With one modification. Count the first three
points 15, 30, 40, just like always.
Tradition isn't all bad.
