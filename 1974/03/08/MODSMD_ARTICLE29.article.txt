# Surprising JV Season Winds Up
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Billy Jones' junior varsity
cagers close out a surprisingly
successful season tonight with a 6
p.m. meeting with the California
JV at Berkeley's Harmon Gym.
Says Jones of Cal, "They're
about the second best JV around
â€” San Jose and then them." What
the overly modest coach fails to
mention, however, is that his
Stanford squad has beaten both.
The Cards ripped the bumbling
Bears, 82-68, five weeks ago at
Maples.
In that game, Cal exceeded
Stanford in turnovers and
personal fouls by 10 each,
enabling the Cards to win handily
despite shooting only .464 from
the floor. Jones says his team
must shoot with more accuracy
and play better defense tonight.
The only bright spot of the
Bears' trip to The Farm was Pat
Motola's 25 points. The 6-8,
220-pound sophomore center
"beat us to death inside," Jones
says. "We didn't defense him
well." The Cardinal coach
promises "a little more pressure"
on Motola this time.
For his own team, now 10-6,
Jones plans the same lineup that
scored 103 points against
Sacramento State last Saturday.
Scott Russell, averaging 12.3
points and 11.1 rebounds per
game, will start at center; Ken
Jurgensen (3.8, 2.8) and Sven
Walker (12.0, 7.1) at the wings;
and Terry McCartin (11.5, 2.5)
and Warner Session (6.8, 1.8) at
the guards.
Stanford's leading scorer,
Marty Moroski, will enter the
game as usual about five minutes
into the first half and try to
maintain his 14.7 scoring average
and take the Cardinal point title
back to Palo Alto.
Assistant coach Bob Buell last
Saturday was already forecasting a
tough game with the Bears, so
overconfidence should not be too
serious a handicap for Stanford.
Still, if the Cards play up to their
recent standards, they should
prove more than a match for their
counterparts from Berkeley.

JV Jots: In his last four games,
Session is 24-39 from the
f100r.... The Cards need a
victory tonight to avoid tying last
vear's JV total of seven losses.
