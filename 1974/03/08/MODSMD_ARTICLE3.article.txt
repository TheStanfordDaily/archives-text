# Parents' Petition Asks New Child Care Site
## 
### AMY SABRIN 
Parents who run the Children's
Center of the Stanford Community
(CCSC) yesterday initiated a petition
to the University to provide them with
new facilities.
The Old Elementary School which
currently houses the CCSC is
scheduled to be torn down to make
room for the proposed faculty housing
project on the Row.
The fate of the CCSC will not be
clear until the University makes a final
decision on the location of the project,
which is currently under
reconsideration.
CCSC staff members soliciting
signatures at the CCSC booth at the
Women's Day Fair reported that the
petition will be sent to President
Richard Lyman, Provost William Miller
and others in the administration. It
asks them to ensure new facilities
because "the students, faculty and
staff of Stanford need full-time,
low-cost, on-campus, parent controlled
and financed quality childcare."
Staff Cites Waiting List
Ann Jones, a CCSC staff member,
said the petition "is just an indication
that people do want day care on
campus that's low-cost and
high-quality — and that's what the
CCSC offers now." There is presently
a waiting list of parents who want to
enroll their children in the center.
"The people who make decisions
about money need to be aware of our
need for convenient day care so that
we can participate fully in the
community," said Jones. If there is no
action taken by next month, she
reported, the parents might take more
"direct action."
Phyllis Craig, consultant to the
dean of student affairs on child care,
doesn't feel such pressure is needed.
'This is not a pressure thing for the
University. They know what their
obligations are and they're doing
everything they can to rehouse the
center," she said.
Ryan Suggested
The University Ifas already offered
the CCSC the only vacant building on
campus as a possible site, the Ryan
Lab on Stanford Avenue. Jones said
that parts of the lab are radioactive,
and even though the University said it
could be decontaminated, the
building's location is inconvenient and
the lay-out unsuitable for child care
facilities.
Furthermore, she said, parents are
beginning to feel the University is

offering "the Ryan Lab or nothing
else. A lot of the parents are getting to
the point where we can't accept the all
or nothing proposition of Ryan Lab.
We feel the University has to change
its priorities to include child care," she
said.
Craig denied this. She said, "Ryan
Lab is only one of the options. There
are other options still." She included
pre-fabricated modules among these.
"We are just beginning to get estimates
on the modules. There is no clear way
of knowing the comparative cost
between that and fixing up the Ryan
Lab."
Estimates on the cost of the needed
modules range from $92,500
according to the CCSC to $280,000
