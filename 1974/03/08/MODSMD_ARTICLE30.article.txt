# 'Big Sail' Set For Lake Lag
## 
### 
It won't be Busch Gardens, but
the beer will be flowing freely
tomorrow afternoon when the
Stanford and California sailing
teams meet in the "Big Sail" on
Lake Lagunita.
Before the races here, the
teams will compete for the
California team racing
championship in San Francisco.
Because neither of the Southern
California schools that qualified
are willing to make the trip, the
regatta will end quickly and the
teams will arrive at Stanford in
time to start the informal Big Sail
races on the lake at 2 p.m.
The Big Sail has taken place
intermittently since 1941. There
is a lot at stake, including a
trophy provided by sailing
alumnus Robert M. Allan. A keg
of beer and the bizarre winds of
Lagunita should make the races a
challenge.
Stanford has been busy
preparing for the Kennedy Cup,
the nation's most prestigious
sailing regatta. The team will
travel to Annapolis, Md. for that
event on April 19-21.
Stanford won the Kennedy
Cup both in 1967 and '68, but
this will be the Cards' first
appearance in the regatta since
1971.
