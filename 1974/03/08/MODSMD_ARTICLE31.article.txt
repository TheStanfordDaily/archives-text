# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
The Pacific Eight publicity
office kindly interpreted the
confusing conference season in
its press release this week.
Besides distributing the regular
team and individual statistics,
the release included a new set
of facts - the "dose" game
records.
In games decided by five
points or less, USC and Oregon
are most successful with
records of 2-0 and 4- /
respectively. UCLA is 3-2,
Washington 1-1, Washington
State 1-1, Oregon State 1-2 and
Stanford a convincing last at
1-5.
This week, the Pac 8 should
feature two dose games up
north and two romps in

California. Stanford will end a
frustrating season on a winning
note with an easy victory over
California, and UCLA will
burst sensationally out of its
recent doldrums with a
convincing win over USC in the
Pac-8 championship decider.
Saturday's game at the
Sports Arena represents the
first time since the Pac-8
conference was formed in 1959
that the league race has been
tied going into the final week
of conference play. The game
will be televised nationally
beginning at 8:40 p.m.
Stanford 83, Cat 64
UCLA 77, USC 65
Oregon 69, Oregon St. 63
Washington 80, Wash. St. 77
