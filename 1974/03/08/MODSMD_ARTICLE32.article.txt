# Mann Concludes Confusing Career
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
For a quick, tall forward, the development
of Mike Mann as a basketball player has been
strangely reminiscent of the painful growing
process of many a slow, short guard.
As a sophomore, Mann showed flashes of
brilliance. As a junior he was less spectacular
but more consistent. As a senior he has been
consistently inactive from his seat on the
bench.
The regression is similar to the
omnipresent slow, short guard, who stars as a
high school sophomore because of his
fundamentals and maturity, plays average
basketball as a junior as his teammates
gradually pass him by and languishes on the
bench his senior year, watching the taller,
quicker players display talents he never
dreamed of.
It hasn't been quite that simple for Mann,
who concludes a confusing three-year career
tonight against California. The analogy,
though, remains fitting.
There have been days in those three years,
when Mike Mann has been simply awesome.
On Jan. 8, 1972, for instance, he scored 18
points, grabbed 13 rebounds and rejected 12
shots against the Washington Huskies.lt was
the kind of performance that made fans
cheer, scream, jump—and then stare blankly
at each other in sheer awe.
Other Times
Against Air Force that same year he
scored 22 points, and in a rematch with the
Huskies at Seattle, he turned in a 26-point
effort on regional television.
There have been other times, though,
when Mike Mann seemed to lack the
fundamentals of most Pee-Wee Leaguers. He
would look lost on the court, pivoting with
the wrong foot, throwing bad passes and
committing turnovers. The weird shooting
form fans gladly endured when the shots
were dropping looked cockeyed and

uncoordinated as Mann's shots glanced off
the rim.
Mann was never a polished player in high
school, but his undisputed natural talents
attracted recruiters from most California
colleges. He was a high school center but
most coaches agreed he was a natural
forward. He smoothly achieved the transition
in his first year at Stanford, leading the
freshman team in scoring from his forward
position as Bub Bowling's squad ran up an
impressive 15-2 record.
Nearly Drowned
The next year, though, Mann nearly
drowned during his varsity baptism. After the
play of lovable Jack Loomis proved
inadequate at the post, Mann moved to
center, where he matched his 6-9, 187-pound
frame against the likes of Bill Walton. "He
always had to take the opposing center,"
recalls Cardinal coach Howie Dallmar,
"which meant he was often giving up 40-60
pounds. It took a lot out of him defensively,
which probably led to the ups and downs."
Mann admits he had to learn post defense
"pretty fast," especially since his high school
team used a zone defense exclusively. "I
blocked Walton's first two shots," Mann
remembers, "but then he got 37 points. I got
sucked up pretty badly— I learned fast that I
couldn't play behind a good center."
Later that season, despite the fact that he
was always "pushed, bumped and joggled
inside," came the outstanding efforts against
Washington and Air Force. Mike finished the
year as Stanford's second leading scorer
(behind Claude Terry), averaging 11.2 points
in addition to his 7.2 rebounding average.
Last year, Dallmar says, things "were a lot
easier for Mike because he was able to
complement [Rich] Kelley instead of
assuming all the inside burden himself."
Mann once again finished the season as
Stanford's second leading scorer (this time

behind Kelley), averaging 8.9 points a game.
This season has been a continual
disappointment, starting with November
knee surgery that slowed him down the early
part of the season. Then, after "he was so
dedicated about getting his knee back in
shape," according to Dallmar, he injured his
other knee against Ohio State over Christmas
vacation. The improved play of Ed
Schweitzer and Tim Patterson, has made it
hard for Mann to break back into the lineup.
'Hell Of A Job'
"I think Mike does a hell of a job," said
assistant coach Billy Jones. "I seriously think
that if he hadn't been injured he'd be starting
now."
Mann, who will enter medical school
next year either at Stanford or Washington
University in St. Louis, says "it's been a
strange feeling to be out of the mainstream,
especially because its been such a frustrating
season. I really think I'm improved—that
every individual has improved—but we've
made enough key mistakes to lose.
"If we win tonight we'll have two more
wins (12) than my sophomore year, which is
just ridiculous. Especially because that year
was such a bumper season for the Pac-8."
Why the lack of improvement, despite the
obviously improved talent? "In general I
think its because there are other things to do
here—there's not a total dedication to
athletics. Guys are more intelligent here.
They go to school, enjoy the sun ..."
Mann admits that he has enjoyed those
diversions. Basketball, in fact, has become a
diversion from his studies, but he emphasizes
that "I've enjoyed Stanford basketball."
And nothing would be more enjoyable for
Mann than to close out his senior season
tonight with one of those awesome
shot-blocking, scoring and rebounding
performances. Fans may be sorry that
tonight is his last game.

disappointment, starting with November
knee surgery that slowed him down the early
part of the season. Then, after "he was so
dedicated about getting his knee back in
shape," according to Dallmar, he injured his
other knee against Ohio State over Christmas
vacation. The improved play of Ed
Schweitzer and Tim Patterson, has made it
hard for Mann to break back into the lineup.
'Hell Of A Job'
"I think Mike does a hell of a job," said
assistant coach Billy Jones. "I seriously think
that if he hadn't been injured he'd be starting
now."
Mann, who will enter medical school
next year either at Stanford or Washington
University in St. Louis, says "it's been a
strange feeling to be out of the mainstream,
especially because its been such a frustrating
season. I really think I'm improved—that
every individual has improved—but we've
made enough key mistakes to lose.
"If we win tonight we'll have two more
wins (12) than my sophomore year, which is
just ridiculous. Especially because that year
was such a bumper season for the Pac-8."
Why the lack of improvement, despite the
obviously improved talent? "In general I
think its because there are other things to do
here—there's not a total dedication to
athletics. Guys are more intelligent here.
They go to school, enjoy the sun ..."
Mann admits that he has enjoyed those
diversions. Basketball, in fact, has become a
diversion from his studies, but he emphasizes
that "I've enjoyed Stanford basketball."
And nothing would be more enjoyable for
Mann than to close out his senior season
tonight with one of those awesome
shot-blocking, scoring and rebounding
performances. Fans may be sorry that
tonight is his last game.

THE LAST HURRAH—Seniors Mike Mann (left) and Jim Montague will be playing in their final game for Stanford when the Cards travel to
Berkeley tonight for an 8:05 p.m. game against California. Howie Dallmar plans to start both players, along with juniors Rich Kelley and Melvin
Arterberry and sophomore Tim Patterson.
For a quick, tall forward, the development
of Mike Mann as a basketball player has been
strangely reminiscent of the painful growing
process of many a slow, short guard.
As a sophomore, Mann showed flashes of
brilliance. As a junior he was less spectacular
but more consistent. As a senior he has been
consistently inactive from his seat on the
bench.
The regression is similar to the
omnipresent slow, short guard, who stars as a
high school sophomore because of his
fundamentals and maturity, plays average
basketball as a junior as his teammates
gradually pass him by and languishes on the
bench his senior year, watching the taller,
quicker players display talents he never
dreamed of.
It hasn't been quite that simple for Mann,
who concludes a confusing three-year career
tonight against California. The analogy,
though, remains fitting.
There have been days in those three years,
when Mike Mann has been simply awesome.
On Jan. 8, 1972, for instance, he scored 18
points, grabbed 13 rebounds and rejected 12
shots against the Washington Huskies.lt was
the kind of performance that made fans
cheer, scream, jump—and then stare blankly
at each other in sheer awe.
Other Times
Against Air Force that same year he
scored 22 points, and in a rematch with the
Huskies at Seattle, he turned in a 26-point
effort on regional television.
There have been other times, though,
when Mike Mann seemed to lack the
fundamentals of most Pee-Wee Leaguers. He
would look lost on the court, pivoting with
the wrong foot, throwing bad passes and
committing turnovers. The weird shooting
form fans gladly endured when the shots
were dropping looked cockeyed and

uncoordinated as Mann's shots glanced off
the rim.
Mann was never a polished player in high
school, but his undisputed natural talents
attracted recruiters from most California
colleges. He was a high school center but
most coaches agreed he was a natural
forward. He smoothly achieved the transition
in his first year at Stanford, leading the
freshman team in scoring from his forward
position as Bub Bowling's squad ran up an
impressive 15-2 record.
Nearly Drowned
The next year, though, Mann nearly
drowned during his varsity baptism. After the
play of lovable Jack Loomis proved
inadequate at the post, Mann moved to
center, where he matched his 6-9, 187-pound
frame against the likes of Bill Walton. "He
always had to take the opposing center,"
recalls Cardinal coach Howie Dallmar,
"which meant he was often giving up 40-60
pounds. It took a lot out of him defensively,
which probably led to the ups and downs."
Mann admits he had to learn post defense
"pretty fast," especially since his high school
team used a zone defense exclusively. "I
blocked Walton's first two shots," Mann
remembers, "but then he got 37 points. I got
sucked up pretty badly— I learned fast that I
couldn't play behind a good center."
Later that season, despite the fact that he
was always "pushed, bumped and joggled
inside," came the outstanding efforts against
Washington and Air Force. Mike finished the
year as Stanford's second leading scorer
(behind Claude Terry), averaging 11.2 points
in addition to his 7.2 rebounding average.
Last year, Dallmar says, things "were a lot
easier for Mike because he was able to
complement [Rich] Kelley instead of
assuming all the inside burden himself."
Mann once again finished the season as
Stanford's second leading scorer (this time

behind Kelley), averaging 8.9 points a game.
This season has been a continual
disappointment, starting with November

the wrong foot, throwing bad passes and
committing turnovers. The weird shooting
form fans gladly endured when the shots
were dropping looked cockeyed and

uncoordinated as Mann's shots glanced off
the rim.
Mann was never a polished player in high
school, but his undisputed natural talents
attracted recruiters from most California
colleges. He was a high school center but
most coaches agreed he was a natural
forward. He smoothly achieved the transition
in his first year at Stanford, leading the
freshman team in scoring from his forward
position as Bub Bowling's squad ran up an
impressive 15-2 record.
Nearly Drowned
The next year, though, Mann nearly
drowned during his varsity baptism. After the
play of lovable Jack Loomis proved
inadequate at the post, Mann moved to
center, where he matched his 6-9, 187-pound
frame against the likes of Bill Walton. "He
always had to take the opposing center,"
recalls Cardinal coach Howie Dallmar,
"which meant he was often giving up 40-60
pounds. It took a lot out of him defensively,
which probably led to the ups and downs."
Mann admits he had to learn post defense
"pretty fast," especially since his high school
team used a zone defense exclusively. "I
blocked Walton's first two shots," Mann
remembers, "but then he got 37 points. I got
sucked up pretty badly— I learned fast that I
couldn't play behind a good center."
Later that season, despite the fact that he
was always "pushed, bumped and joggled
inside," came the outstanding efforts against
Washington and Air Force. Mike finished the
year as Stanford's second leading scorer
(behind Claude Terry), averaging 11.2 points
in addition to his 7.2 rebounding average.
Last year, Dallmar says, things "were a lot
easier for Mike because he was able to
complement [Rich] Kelley instead of
assuming all the inside burden himself."
Mann once again finished the season as
Stanford's second leading scorer (this time

behind Kelley), averaging 8.9 points a game.
This season has been a continual
disappointment, starting with November
knee surgery that slowed him down the early
part of the season. Then, after "he was so
dedicated about getting his knee back in
shape," according to Dallmar, he injured his
other knee against Ohio State over Christmas
vacation. The improved play of Ed
Schweitzer and Tim Patterson, has made it
hard for Mann to break back into the lineup.
'Hell Of A Job'
"I think Mike does a hell of a job," said
assistant coach Billy Jones. "I seriously think
that if he hadn't been injured he'd be starting
now."
Mann, who will enter medical school
next year either at Stanford or Washington
University in St. Louis, says "it's been a
strange feeling to be out of the mainstream,
especially because its been such a frustrating
season. I really think I'm improved—that
every individual has improved—but we've
made enough key mistakes to lose.
"If we win tonight we'll have two more
wins (12) than my sophomore year, which is
just ridiculous. Especially because that year
was such a bumper season for the Pac-8."
Why the lack of improvement, despite the
obviously improved talent? "In general I
think its because there are other things to do
here—there's not a total dedication to
athletics. Guys are more intelligent here.
They go to school, enjoy the sun ..."
Mann admits that he has enjoyed those
diversions. Basketball, in fact, has become a
diversion from his studies, but he emphasizes
that "I've enjoyed Stanford basketball."
And nothing would be more enjoyable for
Mann than to close out his senior season
tonight with one of those awesome
shot-blocking, scoring and rebounding
performances. Fans may be sorry that
tonight is his last game.

THE LAST HURRAH—Seniors Mike Mann (left) and Jim Montague will be playing in their final game for Stanford when the Cards travel to
Berkeley tonight for an 8:05 p.m. game against California. Howie Dallmar plans to start both players, along with juniors Rich Kelley and Melvin
Arterberry and sophomore Tim Patterson.
For a quick, tall forward, the development
of Mike Mann as a basketball player has been
strangely reminiscent of the painful growing
process of many a slow, short guard.
As a sophomore, Mann showed flashes of
brilliance. As a junior he was less spectacular
but more consistent. As a senior he has been
consistently inactive from his seat on the
bench.
The regression is similar to the
omnipresent slow, short guard, who stars as a
high school sophomore because of his
fundamentals and maturity, plays average
basketball as a junior as his teammates
gradually pass him by and languishes on the
bench his senior year, watching the taller,
quicker players display talents he never
dreamed of.
It hasn't been quite that simple for Mann,
who concludes a confusing three-year career
tonight against California. The analogy,
though, remains fitting.
There have been days in those three years,
when Mike Mann has been simply awesome.
On Jan. 8, 1972, for instance, he scored 18
points, grabbed 13 rebounds and rejected 12
shots against the Washington Huskies.lt was
the kind of performance that made fans
cheer, scream, jump—and then stare blankly
at each other in sheer awe.
Other Times
Against Air Force that same year he
scored 22 points, and in a rematch with the
Huskies at Seattle, he turned in a 26-point
effort on regional television.
