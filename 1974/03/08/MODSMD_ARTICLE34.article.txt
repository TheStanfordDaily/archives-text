# Frustrated Cards, Bears Square Off In Season Finale
## 
### STAN WILSON 
"No one seems to blow them
out," said Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar, reflecting upon the
Cards' final game of the season
against Cal tonight in Harmon
Gymnasium.
The close game is something
Dallmar understands. The Cards
have lost their last three games by
a total of six points, as well as a
plethora of other close
disappointing games. Two of
those losses came last weekend
against nationally-ranked USC and
UCLA.
"We played two of the best
teams in the country to a
standstill over the weekend and
easily could have won both
games," lamented Dallmar.
"I don't think I have ever felt
more sorry for a team than I did
this past weekend. Our guys just
never give up."
Cal coach Dick Edwards can
easily empathize with Dallmar.
His Bears were thrashed by UCLA
on Friday night, but came back
strong the next afternoon,
battling USC even only to watch a
last second desperation banker by
guard Dan Anderson clank
through the nets to give the
Trojans a one-point win.
Typical
"The USC game typifies our
season," said Edwards. "We
played hard and we came close,
but not close enough."
Edwards has been
experimenting all season with a
variety of lineups, but one thing
that hasn't changed is the guard
duo of senior Brady Allen and
sophomore Rickie Hawthorne.
"The key is the two guards,"
explained Dallmar. "Allen is one
of the best defensive guards in the
conference, and Hawthorne can
give you trouble if he gets a good
start â€” we've got to get on him
early."
Hawthorne got a good start
against the Trojans last week,
scoring 25 points. A second team
all-Pac-8 selection last season,
Hawthorne scored 18 of those
points in the second half
comeback.
Allen had a pretty good
weekend himself. He scored 40
points, and was named Northern
California player of the week.
Starting Lineup
Joining Allen and Hawthorne
in the starting lineup will
probably be 6-10 freshman center
Rock Lee, senior Carl Meier (6-8)
at one forward, and either 6-5
junior John Terry or 6-7 freshman
Doug Vilotti at the other forward
spot.
The Cards will counter with
dependable center Rich Kelley,
senior forward Mike Mann,
sophomore 6-11 sharpshooter Tim
Patterson, senior guard Jim
Montague, and junior Melvin
Arterberry.
Kelley continues to lead
Stanford in just about every
statistical category, including,

unfortunately, fouls. The agile
seven-footer has averages of 17.9
points and 12.2 rebounds per
game. Although only a junior,
Kelley ranks 16th on the list of
all-time Stanford career scorers.
Oregon's Ron Lee moved ahead of
Kelley last weekend on the Pac-8
scoring list with a 52-point
weekend against the Washington
schools.
The Cards' most improved
player is Arterberry, who scored
34 points last weekend and
grabbed 12 rebounds, raising his
averages to 6.7 and 4.5.
