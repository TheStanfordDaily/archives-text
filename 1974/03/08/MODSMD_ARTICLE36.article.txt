# Cover Boy Lucich Avoids Jinx
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Ever hear of the Sports Illustrated jinx, where
the person, team or thing — Secretariat, for
example — is pictured on the cover. Invariably
something devastating happens.
Well, meet Mark Lucich, who graces the cover of
the Stanford baseball press book. But don't try to
put him in the same class with the Sports
Illustrated bunch because, contray to them, he
hopes to go places.
"I've got to prove I can play this season," said
the 6-3, 200-pound senior first baseman, who hopes
to be drafted in the next major league canvass of
college talent.
A fine season is most important to Lucich, who
was an All-Pacific Eight selection as a freshman,
because "I've made a lot of sacrifices to play. When
you add them all up it comes to quite a bit."
So far this season, Lucich has played with
renewed confidence, hitting well ovei .300 and
leading the team in extra base hits with six — two
home runs, two triples and two doubles. He has 10
runs batted in.
Considering the season statistics Lucich had last
year, it seems that No. 20 is off to a good start. "I
kind of proved a lot to myself last summer playing
up in Fairbanks," he said.
Dim Outlook
Last year at Stanford, Lucich hit .280 and
batted in just 26 runs in 54 games, disappointing
statistics for him. "I never did feel right the whole
school year. Nothing the coaches told me helped. It
kind of made my outlook dimmer."
Then Lucich went north and worked out his
problems with the Goldpanners, two-time National
Baseball Congress semi-pro champs. "The assistant
coach up there pointed out a minor flaw in my
swing. After that everything kind of fell into place.
I've always had a tendency to be a sweeper with the
bat; especially when trying to hit the long ball.
The whole year they [the coaches] told me my
bat was slow. I began to swing too early, which
resulted in five strikeouts in six at bats at Fresno.
The coach at Fairbanks told me to bring the bat
through then snap the wrists. The difference can be
seen when the ball jumps off the bat."
The batting tip obviously helped the psychology
major from Eureka hit .373 for the summer.
Changed Philosophy
Another reason for Lucich's good start this
season is a change in his hitting philosophy,
-omething that Stanford head coach Ray Young

would like to see in all of his players. "In the past,
I've been pretty much a defensive hitter trying to
wait for a good pitch," said Lucich. "This year I'm
trying to hit the pitch when it comes in the strike
zone."
Whenever the Card coaches refer to Lucich they
glow over his fine defensvie ability, one factor that
will help him when the pros draft in the spring.
"Defense has always been easy for me," said
Lucich. "If you concentrate you can be fairly
consistent. But a first baseman has to hit. If you
can play defense at least you know you can help
the team win."
Lucich was an outstanding athlete at Eureka
High, "the only one in town." He lettered in
football, basketball and of course in baseball. He
was the team's starting halfback or split end,
depending on the offensive formation. "We had a
great offense. I was the one who varied in the
offense. It was fun."
Picked By Giants
When Lucich graduated from high school he was
drafted in the fourth round by'the San Francisco
Giants. But he wanted to get a college eduction.
"At Stanford, I'm over my head with
schoolwork and trying to play baseball at the same
time," he said. "I kind of like the situation now
where a major league team will let you go to college
and play during the summer."
"It's been good here but I haven't gotten
everything out of my education. If I was drafted
and signed this summer. I'd probably come back
here next autumn to finish my degree
requirements," he said.

Diamond Notes: Junior Varsity coach Bill
McMonigle will not be able to stay with the squad
next quarter because of personal reasons. His
assistant Mike Higgins, a former Card pitcher,
reports to spring training with the Los Angeles
Dodger organization March 17, leaving the squad in
the hands of the varsity coaches. ... A Stanford
pitcher actually got to swing the bat this week. Max
Goldstein pinch hit safely in the ninth inning
against Santa Clara Wednesday. He drilled a line
drive off the glove of opposing pitcher Frank
O'Connor, then went to second when O'Connor
threw the ball into the stands. .. . The Cardinals
showed up at Buck Shaw Stadium minus balls, bats
and helmets which were left behind in the Stanford
locker room.
