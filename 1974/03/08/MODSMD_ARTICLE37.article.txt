## 
### 
After dropping a 2-1
heartbreaker to Santa Clara
Wednesday, Stanford's baseball
team is scheduled to play San Jose
State this afternoon at 2:30 p.m.
in San Jose Municipal Stadium.
The Cards are slated to host
the Spartans in a doubleheader
beginning at 12 noon in Sunken
Diamond tomorrow. A game
scheduled against Hayward State
yesterday was cancelled because
of wet grounds.
A two-out double by Santa
Clara's Jim Wilhelm at Buck Shaw
Stadium sent home Stanford's A 1
Arthur with his fourth loss in as
many decisions Wednesday and
lowered the Card record to 4-9.
Arthur's performance was
deserving of victory. He walked
three batters, one of those
intentionally, and struck out three
while keeping the Broncos in
check most of the way.
However, one of those walks
led to a run in the first inning.
Phil Convertino walked, stole
second and third, and scored on a
deep fly ball to the left field by
Gene Delyon.
The Cards knotted the score in
the seventh when Baker walked,
was moved to second on a
sacrifice bunt by Kevin Sullivan,
went to third on a ground ball and
scored on John Burtchaell's single.
Stanford 000 000 100 — 1 4 1
Santa Clara 100 000 01X —2 6 3
WP — O'Connor. LP — Arthur (0-4).
Leading hitters — Bartell (SC) 2-3.
