Witness Links Vesco, Mitchell
NEW YORK — A government witness testified
yesterday that hours after financier Robert Vesco
made a $200,000 cash contribution to President
Nixon's re-election campaign, then Atty. Gen. John
N. Mitchell set up a "very productive" meeting
between Vesco's lawyer and the head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Vesco aide Harry Sears testified in United States
District Court that the meeting which Vesco had
been trying to arrange for months jelled quickly
once the cash was delivered to former Commerce
Secretary Maurice H. Stans, who was then Nixon's
re-election finance chairman.
The jury of eight men and four women and the
packed courtroom hung on Sears' every word as he
testified for a third day in the criminal conspiracy
trial of former Cabinet members Mitchell and Stans.
In return for Vesco's contribution, the
government claims, Mitchell and Stans sought to
impede an SEC fraud investigation of Vesco's
far-flung corporate empire.
Despite the meeting with then-SEC Chairman
William Casey and a number of other high-level
conclaves, three months after the contribution
Vesco was discouraged over his legal battles with the
federal investigators and ready to appeal to Stans
for aid, Sears said.
When he argued against such a course of action,
Sears testified, Vesco exploded: "My God, I gave all
that money!"
Simon Raises Gas Allotments
WASHINGTON — Federal energy chief William
E. Simon tapped gasoline stocks yesterday to
increase distribution in March and keep
service-station waiting lines from getting as long as
in February.
Simon announced increases in March averaging
only about 2.9 million gallons per day — an
improvement of about one percent over February —
but the increases were concentrated most heavily in
states with poor supplies, and improvements there
should be more marked.
The increases were distributed so that no state
would receive less than 85 percent of its March,
1972, gasoline supply, adjusted for growth of motor
vehicle registrations since then.
Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute
API reported that gasoline production decreased
about two percent last week, matching a decrease in
refinery operations.
Arab Oil Meeting Disputes Delay
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt has asked a planned
meeting of Arab oil producing countries to lift the

five-month-old embargo against the United States,
an Oil Ministry official said yesterday. But a dispute
apparently was developing over where and when the
meeting will be held.
Egypt said the meeting would be on Sunday in
Cairo. But the Algerian Ministry of Industry and
Energy said Egypt's request for a transfer had been
denied and the meeting would be held as planned in
Tripoli, Libya. Algeria added that the session may
be delayed until March 13.
Arab conferences often reflect the views of the
host country, and a shift back to Libya could
indicate a delay in lifting the oil ban. Libyan
strongman Moammar Khadafy is among the most
militant leaders in the Arab world and there was
speculation the original plan to switch the meeting
site to Cairo grew from resistance on his part to
lifting the embargo.
Algeria, Iraq and the Palestinian guerrillas also
are known to oppose resumption of oil shipments to
the United States. Kuwait is reportedly willing, like
Egypt, to drop the ban.
The ministry officials in Algiers said Egypt asked
Algeria to change the site from Tripoli to Cairo, but
Industry and Energy Minister Belaid Abdessalam
refused. Algeria hosted the last Arab summit
conference and thus President Houair Boumedienne
is current chairman of the Arab League.
British 3-Day Work Week Ends
LONDON — Britain's new Labor government
told the nation's industries yesterday to get back to
full-time work following the settlement of a miners'
strike that forced factories into a three-day week.
Energy Secretary Eric Varley decreed factories
would resume a normal work week at midnight
today after 68 days on part time. That will signal
the end of the grave industrial crisis that
contributed to the downfall of Edward Heath's
Conservative government.
Coal shipments started moving yesterday from
pits to power stations and state-owned steel plants
on which much of industry depends for its raw
materials. The shipments were the first since the
280,000 miners launched a nationwide strike for
more money a month ago.
Varley said industry should get back to a full
production "pretty quickly." However, the
secretary appealed to Britons to continue to cut
electricity consumption in their homes to speed the
return to normality in industry.
Varley said the three-day week had cost about
$4.6 billion in lost production and unemployment
payments to temporarily laid-off workers.
The government's swift settlement came as coal
stocks neared the danger level.

SLA Members Offer Aid
HILLSBOROUGH — Two imprisoned
Syntiionese Liberation Army members claim they
want to save kidnaped heiress Patricia Hearst and
want a nationally televised news conference to
outline their suggestions. There was no immediate
response yesterday to their request. Patricia's SLA
kidnapers continually have linked her fate to that of
the two SLA "soldiers" who now say they may hold
the key to her freedom: Joseph Remiro, 27, and
Russell Little, 24.
Little and Remiro did not elaborate on their
suggestions except to say they "might possibly be
acceptable to the SLA, FBI and the Hearst family
and which could result, if accepted, in the release of
Patricia Hearst."
The young woman's father, Randolph A. Hearst,
president and editor of the San Francisco Examiner,
said yesterday he had no comment as of yet on the
prisoners' letter which was delivered Wednesday
night to Berkeley radio station KPFA.
The two men are charged with the cyanide-bullet
assassination of Oakland Schools Supt. Marcus
Foster - a crime for which the SLA claims
responsibility. They are being held at San Quentin
Prison.
Spanish Church-State Tie To End
MADRID — Dissident Bishop Antonio Anoveros
was summoned to Vatican talks in Madrid yesterday
while the government denied reports it was prepared
to terminate its 1953 Church-state concordat over
the bishop's actions.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the
unconfirmed reports from Church sources were
"false" and "lacked foundation."
The Vatican made no comment on a possible
rupture between the Roman Catholic Church and
the Spanish government.
The break, if it developed, would leave the
government free to try the bishop for what it called
"a grave attack on national unity" by urging more
freedom for the Basque minority. It would also
mark the lowest point in Church-state relations
since the end of the civil war in 1939.
The concordat, attacked by both the Church and
state as an anachronism in recent years bars trial or
arrest of bishops without permission of the Vatican.
