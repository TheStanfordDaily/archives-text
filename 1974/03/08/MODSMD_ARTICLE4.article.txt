# Van Den Haag Supports Stricter Punishment As Crime Deterrent
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The threat of punishment is an effective deterrent to
crime, Ernest van den Haag, author and professor of social
philosophy at New York University, told a Stanford
audience last night.
"Human law has to be enforced by punishment," van
den Haag stated. "Otherwise the whole regulation of human
life would be futile."Van den Haag addressed 200 people in
Bishop Auditorium as part of series of talks by conservative
thinkers sponsored by the Conservative Forum.
Blaming the nation's rising crime rate on the laxity of its
law enforcement, van den Haag noted that less than one
percent of all crimes committed in the United States lead to
any time in jail.
"We have a situation in which crime pays," van den Haag
said. In this sense, crime is rational." If crime is rational, it
cannot be reduced, he said.
Either heavier penalties or stricter application of existing
penalties would reduce crime, van den Haag insisted.
Emphasizes Deterrent
But van den Haag emphasized that the purpose of stiff
penalties is not rehabilitate the criminal, but rather to deter
other people from committing crimes.
"At this time, we do not know how to rehabilitate at
all," van den Haag commented.
Statistics show that rates of recidivism are not changed
by harsh penalties, light penalties, psychiatric treatment or
counselling services, van den Haag claimed.
"It does not matter what you do with a convict as far as
his future behavior is concerned," van den Haag insisted.
'Statistics Distorted'
He pointed out that statistics regarding the rehabilitation
of criminals can be and often are distorted. For example, it
has been shown that many criminals reform after years of
rehabilitation. But such statistics do not take into account
that after a certain age, a criminal's inclination towards

crime declines regardless of his treatment.
Van den Haag declared that if statistics are properly
read, they confirm his views about the need for a tough
approach to crime.
Although van den Haag emphasized the need to balance
justice with punishment, he affirmed that "justice is never
an alternative to order."
Society must be utilitarian in its approach to crime, van
den Haag said. Although it is perhaps more just to punish a
person who wilfully commits a homicide than to punish
one who kills by drunken driving, it would be more
practical to impose stricter penalties on the drunken driver,
he noted.
Laws Discriminatory
Justice also involves making the laws as fair to all people
as is possible, he stated. But laws cannot help but to
discriminate against people who are inclined to crimes, and
therefore can never serve all people equally, he remarked.
Van den Haag's speech was followed by a panel
discussion involving Stanford professors.
Barbara Babcock, professor of law, argued that crime is
often its own punishment. "It is a life alienated from
society and divorced from hope," she said.
Van den Haag expressed agreement with this
observation, but noted that his point was never that
punishment changes the convicted criminal, but rather that
it deters the potential offender.
Babcock added that she doubted that crime has actually
risen very much in this century as penalties have declined.
Van den Haag pointed out that he never claimed that
crime has been increased over a long period of time. But
the crime rate in the nation has risen in the past ten
years as law enforcement has grown lax, he stated. This
further substantiates the contention that threat of
punishment deters crime, he said.

his future behavior is concerned," van den Haag insisted.
'Statistics Distorted'
He pointed out that statistics regarding the rehabilitation
of criminals can be and often are distorted. For example, it
has been shown that many criminals reform after years of
rehabilitation. But such statistics do not take into account
that after a certain age, a criminal's inclination towards

crime declines regardless of his treatment.
Van den Haag declared that if statistics are properly
read, they confirm his views about the need for a tough
approach to crime.
Although van den Haag emphasized the need to balance
justice with punishment, he affirmed that "justice is never
an alternative to order."
Society must be utilitarian in its approach to crime, van
den Haag said. Although it is perhaps more just to punish a
person who wilfully commits a homicide than to punish
one who kills by drunken driving, it would be more
practical to impose stricter penalties on the drunken driver,
he noted.
Laws Discriminatory
Justice also involves making the laws as fair to all people
as is possible, he stated. But laws cannot help but to
discriminate against people who are inclined to crimes, and
therefore can never serve all people equally, he remarked.
Van den Haag's speech was followed by a panel
discussion involving Stanford professors.
Barbara Babcock, professor of law, argued that crime is
often its own punishment. "It is a life alienated from
society and divorced from hope," she said.
Van den Haag expressed agreement with this
observation, but noted that his point was never that
punishment changes the convicted criminal, but rather that
it deters the potential offender.
Babcock added that she doubted that crime has actually
risen very much in this century as penalties have declined.
Van den Haag pointed out that he never claimed that
crime has been increased over a long period of time. But
the crime rate in the nation has risen in the past ten
years as law enforcement has grown lax, he stated. This
further substantiates the contention that threat of
punishment deters crime, he said.

PUNISHMENT DEFENDED — Ernest van den Haag, conservative sociologist and
author, told Stanford students last night that stiff penalties deter crime. Van den
Haag later debated Stanford professors and answered questions from the
audience.
The threat of punishment is an effective deterrent to
crime, Ernest van den Haag, author and professor of social
philosophy at New York University, told a Stanford
audience last night.
"Human law has to be enforced by punishment," van
den Haag stated. "Otherwise the whole regulation of human
life would be futile."Van den Haag addressed 200 people in
Bishop Auditorium as part of series of talks by conservative
thinkers sponsored by the Conservative Forum.
Blaming the nation's rising crime rate on the laxity of its
law enforcement, van den Haag noted that less than one
percent of all crimes committed in the United States lead to
any time in jail.
"We have a situation in which crime pays," van den Haag
said. In this sense, crime is rational." If crime is rational, it
cannot be reduced, he said.
Either heavier penalties or stricter application of existing
penalties would reduce crime, van den Haag insisted.
Emphasizes Deterrent
But van den Haag emphasized that the purpose of stiff
penalties is not rehabilitate the criminal, but rather to deter
other people from committing crimes.
"At this time, we do not know how to rehabilitate at
all," van den Haag commented.
Statistics show that rates of recidivism are not changed
by harsh penalties, light penalties, psychiatric treatment or
counselling services, van den Haag claimed.
"It does not matter what you do with a convict as far as
his future behavior is concerned," van den Haag insisted.
