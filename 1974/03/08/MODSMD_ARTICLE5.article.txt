# Ehrlichman Indicted Again
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - John D.
Ehrlichman, already charged with
conspiring in the Watergate cover-up,
was indicted again yesterday, this time
for allegedly sending White House
agents to rifle a psychiatrist's office
and lying about it later.
The federal grand ju»y charged
Ehrlichman, along with fjciavi 'VvX-.
House aide Charles W. Colson and four
men tied to the Watergate burglary,
with conspiring to violate the rights of
Dr. Lewis J. Fielding of Los Angeles.
The felony indictment said the
intent was "to search for confidential
information concerning Daniel
Ellsberg" in the September 1971
break-in.
Ehrlichman Denials
Ehrlichman, who resigned as
President Nixon's top domestic adviser
last April 30, had denied knowing in
advance about the Fielding break-in
but said national security could justify
it.
The White House special
investigations unit, nicknamed "the
plumbers," had been put in his charge
by President Nixon.
The conspiracy charge, carrying a
maximum 10 years in prison and a
$10,000 fine, named Ehrlichman,
Colson, G. Gordon Liddy, Bernard L.
Barker, Felipe DeDiego and Eugenio
R. Martinez.
Additionally Ehrlichman alone was
charged in one count of lying to the
FBI and three of lying to the grand

jury. Each carries a maximum five-year
prison term and a $10,000 fine.
If convicted on all counts in the
Watergate cover-up and Ellsberg case
indictments, Ehrlichman would be
liable for a 55-year prison term. He
also is scheduled for trial April 15 on
conspiracy, burglary and perjury
ciiaiges in Los Angeles.
Second Indictment
Colson, facing his second
indictment in six days, restated his
innocence and said, "There is much
the public has not been told about
circumstances surrounding this matter.
A great deal more may be revealed in
the course of this proceeding." Colson
formerly was special counsel to Nixon.
Barker and Martinez pleaded guilty
to breaking into the Watergate office
building quarters of the Democratic
National Committee. Martinez was
released on parole hours before
yesterday's indictment. Barker is free
on appeal.
G. Gordon Liddy, the stoic
mastermind of the Watergate break-in
and a team leader in the Ellsberg
foray, was charged also in a separate
indictment yesterday with two counts
of refusing to testify or produce
papers when he was called before a
House committee last July.
Bay Of Pigs
DeDiego, along with Barker and
Martinez from Miami's Cuban
community-and like them a veteran of
the Bay of Pigs invasion-was indicted
for the first time.
But he was named in the
Liddy-James W. McCord Watergate
trial as one of the men who broke into
Watergate some three weeks before the
others were arrested inside.
Barker heard of the indictment at a
Spanish-language radio station in

Miami where he was to broadcast an
appeal to the Cuban community to
attend an airport "welcome home"
ceremony for Martinez and Virgilio
Gonzalez, another of the Watergate
burglars paroled yesterday.
"We will fight this indictment and
we will plead innocent," Barker said.
"I speak for DeDiego, Martinez and
myself."
Yesterday's indictment was
returned by a grand jury impaneled in
August 1973, a time when the original
Watergate grand jury had its hands full
with investigations.
It named Egil Krogh Jr., E. Howard
Hunt Jr. and David R. Young as
co-conspirators in the Ellsberg case,
but did not indict them.
Hunt and Young were given
immunity in return for their testimony
before various forums and therefore
were not charged, but Young remains
a defendant in California.
As the court indicted Ehrlichman
and Colson, the House Judiciary
Committee considered President
Nixon's offer to turn over the same
evidence in the Watergate case that he
had given a grand jury.

a defendant in California.
As the court indicted Ehrlichman
and Colson, the House Judiciary
Committee considered President
Nixon's offer to turn over the same
evidence in the Watergate case that he
had given a grand jury.
WASHINGTON (AP) - John D.
Ehrlichman, already charged with
conspiring in the Watergate cover-up,
was indicted again yesterday, this time
for allegedly sending White House
agents to rifle a psychiatrist's office
and lying about it later.
The federal grand ju»y charged
Ehrlichman, along with fjciavi 'VvX-.
House aide Charles W. Colson and four
men tied to the Watergate burglary,
with conspiring to violate the rights of
Dr. Lewis J. Fielding of Los Angeles.
The felony indictment said the
intent was "to search for confidential
information concerning Daniel
Ellsberg" in the September 1971
break-in.
Ehrlichman Denials
Ehrlichman, who resigned as
President Nixon's top domestic adviser
last April 30, had denied knowing in
advance about the Fielding break-in
but said national security could justify
it.
The White House special
investigations unit, nicknamed "the
plumbers," had been put in his charge
by President Nixon.
The conspiracy charge, carrying a
maximum 10 years in prison and a
$10,000 fine, named Ehrlichman,
Colson, G. Gordon Liddy, Bernard L.
Barker, Felipe DeDiego and Eugenio
R. Martinez.
Additionally Ehrlichman alone was
charged in one count of lying to the
FBI and three of lying to the grand

jury. Each carries a maximum five-year
prison term and a $10,000 fine.
If convicted on all counts in the
Watergate cover-up and Ellsberg case
indictments, Ehrlichman would be
liable for a 55-year prison term. He
also is scheduled for trial April 15 on
conspiracy, burglary and perjury
ciiaiges in Los Angeles.
Second Indictment
Colson, facing his second
indictment in six days, restated his
innocence and said, "There is much
the public has not been told about
circumstances surrounding this matter.
A great deal more may be revealed in
the course of this proceeding." Colson
formerly was special counsel to Nixon.
Barker and Martinez pleaded guilty
to breaking into the Watergate office
building quarters of the Democratic
National Committee. Martinez was
released on parole hours before
yesterday's indictment. Barker is free
on appeal.
G. Gordon Liddy, the stoic
mastermind of the Watergate break-in
and a team leader in the Ellsberg
foray, was charged also in a separate
indictment yesterday with two counts
of refusing to testify or produce
papers when he was called before a
House committee last July.
Bay Of Pigs
DeDiego, along with Barker and
Martinez from Miami's Cuban
community-and like them a veteran of
the Bay of Pigs invasion-was indicted
for the first time.
But he was named in the
Liddy-James W. McCord Watergate
trial as one of the men who broke into
Watergate some three weeks before the
others were arrested inside.
Barker heard of the indictment at a
Spanish-language radio station in

Miami where he was to broadcast an
appeal to the Cuban community to
attend an airport "welcome home"
ceremony for Martinez and Virgilio
Gonzalez, another of the Watergate
burglars paroled yesterday.
"We will fight this indictment and
we will plead innocent," Barker said.
"I speak for DeDiego, Martinez and
myself."
Yesterday's indictment was
returned by a grand jury impaneled in
August 1973, a time when the original
Watergate grand jury had its hands full
with investigations.
It named Egil Krogh Jr., E. Howard
Hunt Jr. and David R. Young as
co-conspirators in the Ellsberg case,
but did not indict them.
Hunt and Young were given
immunity in return for their testimony
before various forums and therefore
were not charged, but Young remains
a defendant in California.
