# On Impeachment

Richard Fall 1

There appear to be several
rather fallacious arguments in the
column by Bill Ross in the Daily,
March 4, concerning the
impeachment of Richard Nixon.
These should not be allowed to
stand unchallenged.
First of all, there seems to be a
general impression on the part of
Ross that the people who want to
see Nixon impeached (if indeed he
is guilty) are all liberals. While this
generalization does tend to hold
true, there are also many
conservatives who would like to
see him out of office.
But the more important point
is that there are those of us who,
while liberal in political outlook,
would rather have an honest (if
not altogether intelligent)
politician than a dishonest one in
the office of the President, no
matter what side of the political
fence he is on.
Obvious Fallacy
Ross also tries to make the
point that if the Congress can
muster the votes to impeach
Nixon, it also can raise the
necessary votes to override any
veto he should attempt to sustain.
This is a fairly obvious fallacy.
How can the impeachment of a
President be compared to the

everyday work of passing
legislation?
The Congress will be much less
likely to vote along party lines in
the case of an impeachment (if
there is fairly reasonable evidence
of guilt) than in that of legislating.
Finally, it is not true, as Ross
states, that the position of the
President after this affair will
preclude events such as this from
occurring again. Nixon still
appears quite active at the present
in his efforts to cover up the affair
and stall the legal proceedings.
If Affair Dies
And if the affair died down,
while he remained in office, what
would keep this same type of
affair from occurring again?
Ross suggests that we look at
the logical consequences of
removing Richard Nixon from
office, and he has an excellent
point in doing so. But may I
suggest to him that he also try to
look at the even more deadly
consequences of leaving a man
who has possibly committed
criminal acts (and most certainly
has broken his oath to uphold the
Constitution) in that same office.
This is why so many of us are
in favor of impeachment.
