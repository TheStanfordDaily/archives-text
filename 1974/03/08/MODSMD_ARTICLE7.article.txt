TA Union 'Destructive'
Editor:
Raymond Meyer (Daily, March
4) is very confused about the
student's basic relation to the
faculty or the University.
In standard philosophical
terms, one becomes a Master only
by the assumption of total
responsibility. In military terms,
this means the acceptance of total
risk in a crucial encounter with
death.
In spiritual or intellectual
terms, the equivalent is a
profound psychic adventure
resulting in a "master-piece;"
there are "horizontal" equivalents
to this in the form of prolonged
labors.
It is precisely the fact that the
apprentice has not yet crossed the
Ifne of final trial, or initiation,
that gives him his sense of
direction, his reason for striving.
Accordingly, the faculty must
refuse him the status of equal
rights; the alternative, directly
contrary to what Meyer believes,
is spiritual castration.
The relation to the
Administration is corollary to the
above. Just as the student is
spiritually mediated by and
dependent upon the faaekv
models, so is he financially
dependent upon the University as
a fiscal, or "physical," body. He is
far from being self-supporting,
even with TA work.
Of course there are gradations,
practical accommodations, etc., in
these relations: I am simply
speaking of principles which
cannot be violated without
destructive effect. A graduate
student union would be
destructive in this sense.

Dallmar's Coaching
Editor:
After watching Stanford's
basketball games against USC and
UCLA last weekend, I feel
compelled to comment on the
coaching ability of Howie
Dallmar.
Year after year. Coach Dallmar

has led Stanford teams to
mediocre if not miserable seasons,
and contrary to what some people
may think, Stanford teams are not
"snake bitten" or "just plain
unlucky."
The fact is, that for the past
two years at least, Stanford has
had some excelllent basketball
players and potentially great
basketball teams.
Why then do Stanford teams
continue to lose the "big games"
and continue to end up with
mediocre seasons?
In my opinion, one look at the
way Dallmar has coached this past
season, and particularly the way
he coached the USC and UCLA
games, is enough to answer that
question.
I believe that anyone with even
the slightest knowledge of
basketball, would agree with the
things I have mentioned and since
the Athletic Department has
continued to remain silent
concerning this matter, I feel that
it is up to the fans, and
particularly the players, to speak
out on the coaching situation that
exists on Stanford's basketball
team.

Chivalry Lives
Editor:
In this age of strident
liberationists, it's a miracle that
chivalry hasn't perished along
with chauvinism.
Indeed, chivalry is alive and
well at a local ga;> station.
A charming service station
attendant allowed me to slip into
line in front of the "no more gas
today" sign during my last endless
wait for precious petrol.
I doubt that any of the
liberated women who objected to
the infamous "honey shots"
would have refused such a sexist
favor from a man.
Obviously, there are still some
things that only a young woman's
smile can buy.
