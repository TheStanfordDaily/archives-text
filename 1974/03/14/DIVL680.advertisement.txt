REPORT ON STUDENT DISCIPLINARY ACTION
DOS A Case No. 29, October 23, 1V73, Assault
The University Administration filed charges for a
violation of the Fundamental Standard against a student
who physically assaulted another student.
The student asked the Dean of Student Affairs to
hear the case, and the dean agreed to do so.
The dean observed that ordinarily the penalty for
assault should be at least one quarter's suspension.
However, because of substantial extenuating circum
stances, he recommended in this case that the student
complete a work fine of 140 hours prior to June 6,
1974; that the student accept the stipulation that the
privilege oi operating a motor vehicle on the campus be
withdrawn until June 6, 1974; and that the student
agree to abstain from the use of any intoxicating agents
while on campus and refrain from coming onto the
campus while under the influence of such agents.
Failure to abide by these conditions will constitute
cause to consider the student's immediate suspension
from the University. This recommendation was approved
by the President of the University.
Space paid by Stanford News and Publications service.
