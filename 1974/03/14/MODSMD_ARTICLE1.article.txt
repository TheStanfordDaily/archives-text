# Report Says Embargo To End
## 
### 
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — The Arab
oil ministers ended a one-day meeting
here late yesterday, and a high Libyan
official said they had decided to lift
the oil embargo against the United
States.
The official added they would not
officially announce it in Tripoli,
however.
There is speculation that the
decision was not announced in Tripoli
because the panel felt it should be
announced elsewhere, since Libya has
opposed the lifting of the embargo
until now.
The oil ministers adjourned their
closed meeting without announcing
any decision. The Libyan official said
the meeting would be resumed in
Vienna, Austria, on Sunday.
The ban has been in effect since the
October Middle East war.
Pressure From Sadat
Egypt's President Anwar Sadat had
pressed the Arab oil exporters for
weeks to lift the embargo in
recognition of American efforts to
obtain an Israeli withdrawal from the
Suez Canal.
The Tripoli meeting ended at 11:30
p.m. — 2:30 p.m. PDT — less than six
hours after it began. Algerian Industry
Minister Belaid Abdesselam chaired
the session. He is current president of
he Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries.

The Arab oil ministers' meeting was
the third attempt to bring Arab oil
producers together to consider an
Egyptian-backed request for an end to
the oil embargo.
Opposition To Meeting
The meeting was first scheduled for
Feb. 14 but did not take place then
because of Algerian and Libyan
opposition. A meeting in Cairo last
Sunday also was blocked by the two
holdout nations.
The Arab meeting in Vienna will be
held the day after ministers of the

Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries — OPEC — meet there to set
new prices for oil from the Persian
Gulf, Libya and Algeria. Observers in
Vienna say the outcome of that
meeting is "entirely unpredictable."
Earlier, the Egyptian press had
reported that the Tripoli conference
would lift the embargo and resume full
production of oil.
Newspaper Reports
A 1 Ahram, Egypt's leading paper
which often reflects official views,
reported from Tripoli that the ban

against the United States and the
Netherlands would be lifted and
production cutbacks amounting to 25
percent or more would be ended.
Whenever the embargo ends, the
direct relief will not be felt here
immediately.
It will take about one month for
the first tanker of Arab oil to reach
the United States from the Persian
Gulf.
The embargo and cutbacks were
ordered during the October war in the
Middle East to pressure oil importing
nations to withdraw support for Israel.
Conference Communique
A 1 Ahram said the conference
would issue a communique reviewing
effectiveness of the oil weapon and
explaining the decision to put it aside.
It said the conference would recognize
the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger in working out a
Middle East settlement.
Unless Arab production were
increased to pre-embargo levels and
perhaps higher, petroleum supplies in
the United States would remain tight
and allow no flexibility for economic
growth. That might well require
continued fuel-conservation efforts.
Federal energy officials
acknowledge it would be wise to
restrain the growth of oil demand to
prevent U.S. dependence on Arab oil
from getting much larger before the
United States can develop new energy
resources of its own.
Even if the Arabs provide all the oil
the United States wants, the
international oil price would remain a
problem. The more foreign oil the
United States imports, the greater the
problem would become as payments
for that oil drain dollars from the
domestic economy.
Last September, the typical posted
price of Arab oil was $3.01 per barrel;
now it is $11.65.
Meanwhile, Deputy Federal energy
chief John C. Sawhill said yesterday
the administration will release reserve
petroterum supplies to give the
economy a quick boost once Middle
East oil begins flowing.
And President Nixon met with key
advisers on energy problems.
The White House, however, played
down the importance of Nixon's
meeting with his Emergency Energy
Action Group.

TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — The Arab
oil ministers ended a one-day meeting
here late yesterday, and a high Libyan
official said they had decided to lift
the oil embargo against the United
States.
The official added they would not
officially announce it in Tripoli,
however.
There is speculation that the
decision was not announced in Tripoli
because the panel felt it should be
announced elsewhere, since Libya has
opposed the lifting of the embargo
until now.
The oil ministers adjourned their
closed meeting without announcing
any decision. The Libyan official said
the meeting would be resumed in
Vienna, Austria, on Sunday.
The ban has been in effect since the
October Middle East war.
Pressure From Sadat
Egypt's President Anwar Sadat had
pressed the Arab oil exporters for
weeks to lift the embargo in
recognition of American efforts to
obtain an Israeli withdrawal from the
Suez Canal.
The Tripoli meeting ended at 11:30
p.m. — 2:30 p.m. PDT — less than six
hours after it began. Algerian Industry
Minister Belaid Abdesselam chaired
the session. He is current president of
he Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries.

The Arab oil ministers' meeting was
the third attempt to bring Arab oil
producers together to consider an
Egyptian-backed request for an end to
the oil embargo.
Opposition To Meeting
The meeting was first scheduled for
Feb. 14 but did not take place then
because of Algerian and Libyan
opposition. A meeting in Cairo last
Sunday also was blocked by the two
holdout nations.
The Arab meeting in Vienna will be
held the day after ministers of the

Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries — OPEC — meet there to set
new prices for oil from the Persian
Gulf, Libya and Algeria. Observers in
Vienna say the outcome of that
meeting is "entirely unpredictable."
Earlier, the Egyptian press had
reported that the Tripoli conference
would lift the embargo and resume full
production of oil.
Newspaper Reports
A 1 Ahram, Egypt's leading paper
which often reflects official views,
reported from Tripoli that the ban

against the United States and the
Netherlands would be lifted and
production cutbacks amounting to 25
percent or more would be ended.
Whenever the embargo ends, the
direct relief will not be felt here
immediately.
It will take about one month for
the first tanker of Arab oil to reach
the United States from the Persian
Gulf.
The embargo and cutbacks were
ordered during the October war in the
Middle East to pressure oil importing
nations to withdraw support for Israel.
Conference Communique
A 1 Ahram said the conference
would issue a communique reviewing
effectiveness of the oil weapon and
explaining the decision to put it aside.
It said the conference would recognize
the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger in working out a
Middle East settlement.
Unless Arab production were
increased to pre-embargo levels and
perhaps higher, petroleum supplies in
the United States would remain tight
and allow no flexibility for economic
growth. That might well require
continued fuel-conservation efforts.
Federal energy officials
acknowledge it would be wise to
restrain the growth of oil demand to
prevent U.S. dependence on Arab oil
from getting much larger before the
United States can develop new energy
resources of its own.
Even if the Arabs provide all the oil
the United States wants, the
international oil price would remain a
problem. The more foreign oil the
United States imports, the greater the
problem would become as payments
for that oil drain dollars from the
domestic economy.
Last September, the typical posted
