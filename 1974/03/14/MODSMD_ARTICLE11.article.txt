# SLA And Revolutionary Strategy

In her letter to the people,
Nancy Ling Perry points out:
"The government is now in the
rapid and steady process of
removing the means of survival
from the lower class" and in a
sense "giving these benefits to the
middle class in an effort to rally
support from them." It is
polarizing the working class and
races into two parts: a lower
income and often unemployed
part, forced to take the brunt of
our economic crisis, and a higher
paid part, afraid of losing what it
has and encouraged to blame its
troubles on the poor, blacks and
welfare.
The highest paid section, the
"labor aristocracy," is bought off
and often used against the others.
So we see higher paid Teamsters
vamp on farmworkers. In turn, we
see the unemployed rip-off their
employed neighbors, and blacks
turn against whites instead of the
real source of their troubles, the
"ruling class" â€” those who

literally own most of the nation's
corporations, banks and wealth
and for whom most everyone else
works.
Working Class Split
In 1932 in Germany,
confidential letters sent to the
heads of industries laid out the
strategy of dividing the working
class and bringing in fascism." In
a real depression, they wrote, "the
only possible means of saving
bourgeois rule from the abyss is to
effect the splitting of the working
class by other and more direct
means. Herein lies the positive
possibilities and the tasks of
National Socialism (Nazism)."
This is a goocl' time for the
ruling class here to tighten its
reins likewise, and, in fact, we see
signs of it every day. For a
moment "the Movement" is
disorganized and parts of it are
retreating. This is exactly the time
we cannot afford to make a
mistake in revolutionary strategy,
and the SLA is making a big one.

Its strategy is that military actions
without the support and
participation of the people can
help bring about revolution,
strategy is that third world and
white groups will send delegates
to a War Council to build a
military alliance. "Let the voices
of their guns express the words of
freedom," they say.
The only way our guns are
going to change things, in fact, is
if we use the right strategy. That
must be to help build a
revolutionary party based in the
working class which will bring the
divided workers together, link the
third world and working class
movements together and build a
revolutionary army.
Link With People
The issue here isn't whether
that army is aboveground or
underground, or now or later. The
issue is that it must be linked with
the people. That army, however,
will have to use violent tactics.
"It has been the history of
many political leaders ... to
pretend that people will somehow
achieve their liberation without
revolutionary violence, as the SLA
puts it. This is the view that the
ruling class will let itself be slowly
reformed, or voted or pressured
with strikes to relinquish its
immense political and financial
power; that the ruling class can be
peacefully persuaded to give back
their immense wealth to the
workers who produce it. This view
is called "reformism" and is, in
the long run, more deadly than
the SLA's "adventurism."
In 1920 workers seized

factories in Italy. They established
their own workers' committees
and armed guards, and the
government was powerless
because the army wouldn't move
against them. It was the reformist
Confederation of labor that did
what the ruling class could not: it
got the workers to lay down their
arms, to evacuate the factories, to
"take their grievances through
legitimate channels" (like
elections), and to settle for a 20
percent wage increase and more
worker control of the factories.
Ruling Class Victory
That was in September. In
November the fascists launched
their first attack and killed
workers and burned union halls.
Within one year the ruling class
had smashed them. Not only were
the promised reforms forgotten,
but the workers were forced to
take the brunt of the depression.
The same thing happened in
Germany, and has happened over
and over until this year again in
Chile.
The irony is that reformist
leaders (like Chile's Allende, or
England's Harold Wilson, or the
Communist Party) who appear so
reasonable, so responsible and so
cautious in fact lead workers into
a bloody trap, militarily
unprepared and even unarmed
against a ruling class which has
shown no limits to its brutality
when threatened.
In the long run, it is this kind
of mistake more than the SLA's
adventurism we will have to fight
the hardest.
