# Pre-Med Studies

In response to John Siiiila's
letter of March 5, I would admit
that he wrote two reasonable
lines: liberal arts institutions can
serve to show students
"the methods intelligent people
use to control their lives," and for
$5000 a year students "should be
allowed to think." However, these
don't at all apply to his arguments
against pre-meds.
I'm a pre-med and I don't feel
the least bit "buried in
technology." To fulfill med
school requirements I have to take
two years of unconcentrated
science courses, and I have plenty
of time to take history and french
courses that suffice to "rid
[students] of traditional
ignorance."
Many pre-meds I know also
take plenty of non-science
courses. In fact, the science
majors I know take far more
humanities courses than
humanities majors take science
courses. This shows a wider range
of academic pursuit in pre-meds
than in pre-laws, who rarely
encounter real science courses and
profit from the mental exercise
required to solve a scientific
research problem.
And it's not pre-meds who
"clamor for power, prestige, and
money." I submit as evidence
such former pre-laws as Herbert
Kalmbach, John Mitchell, Richard
Nixon, etc. Are they the ones
busy combatting "the tremendous
problems facing our world
today"? Nor can I accept Siirila's
assumption that technology has
such a minor importance in
society.
As a poli-sci major he might
know that Marxian theory
maintains that changes in modes
of production, based on
technology that science majors
study, are a major influence on
man's relationship to society.
This, and advances in medical
technology, do a lot to help
mankind. Scientists have done a
lot more for the world in the last
several decades than have well
trained political scientists
(including the good of a H<>nry
Kissinger and the bad of
technologically advanced
warfare).
I really don't think that our
"increasing numbers are
destroying the character of the
remaining student*,"' hut if they
are, then it doesn't speak well for
those students' tolerance or
intelligence. I don't propose
technological takeover, but
neither do I advocate the training
of too many political scientists
who think only they know the
way populations should be
proportioned among teachers and
scientists and politicians and
doctors.
