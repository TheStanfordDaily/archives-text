# Science And Specialization

John Smillie

Throughout the history of education, people
like John Siirila (Daily, March 5) have assumed that
only the subjects that they could comprehendi
were important subjects. Siirila's ignorance is more
unfortunate than most, however, because his
criticism of the trend towards pre-med
specialization is worth listening to.
The problem with Siirila is that he is a perfect
example of the narrow-mindedness of the opposite
kind of specializationâ€”specialization in the social
sciences.
Siirila's claim that the number of pre-meds on
campus "destroys the character of the remaining
students," seems to reveal only insecurity on his
part. I certainly agree with him that there is folly in
the educational priorities of those who "restrict
their energy to one limited facet of education."
Character Not Destroyed
It certainly bothers me to see people that seem
to me to be "wasting their time here." I am critical
of them. But they don't, in any way, destroy my
character.
Siirila's anti-pre-med prejudice, however, does
not show his ignorance, but merely his lack of tact.
His ignorance shows in his apparent desire to rid
the University of scientific study. What could be
more ludicrous than to assess the importance of
science by the position of science news in the
newspaper?
To assert that science is "relatively
unimportant" would be dangerous if it were
believed by anyone other than Siirila himself. It
would be interesting to see social scientists
accomplishing (or trying to accomplish) what they
are accomplishing today without the assistance of
mdoern mathematical and scientific developments.
I'd do everything I could to keep Siirila from
making important "political science" decisions
concerning nuclear power without some knowledge
of elementary nuclear physics.
Responsibilities of Medicine
Siirila's assertion that the doctors of the future
will be little more than technicians, with no original
thought required in their decision-making, shows
little recognition of the responsibilities inherent in

the medical profession.
His assertion that a "liberal arts education"
excludes the natural sciences also seems to have
been made with undue haste, at the very least. I
believe Siirila himself is a student of the
"School of Humanities and Sciences." His semantic
connection of "this great liberal university" with
liberal attitudes towards politics and curricula
indicates either ignorance of the various meanings
of the word, "liberal," or an unconscious flwre for
the comic.
What is saddest of all is Siirila's own
closed-mindedness, and the narrowness of his
educational philosophy. I would think that anyone
who desired a well-rounded education, as he
professes he does, would take some science courses
and might discover the importance of science.
Lesson From Enlightenment
Siirila's misuse of historical arguments is also
unfortunate. He begins and ends his letter with
historical defenses of his argument, but ignores a
lesson that he might have learned from the
Enlightenment. The scientific discoveries of
Newton and his contemporaries led to the
liberation of Europe from the chains of religious
superstition and monarchist denomination; Siirila
would know this if he had a passing knowledge of
the Enlightenment.
Siirila's own interest in social science was
inherited from the Englihtenment philosophers'
desire to apply Newtonian principles and the spirit
of scientific discovery to the study of man, in order
to discover the laws that govern his actions.
"Change is the constant state of the world," as Mr.
Siirila points out, and science plays (and has
played) an important part in that change.
I share completely Siirila's anxiety over the
restricted field of interest that seems to be
characterisitc of many pre-meds. However, his
sweeping generalizations and pat criticisms are not
going to persuade anyone to broaden their
horizons. Certainly no one will be influenced by his
example.
