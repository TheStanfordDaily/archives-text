# College Terrace Traffic
## 
### 
During the current discussion
of the College Terrace traffic
problem, the impression
sometimes is given that Stanford
has been a passive and uncaring
witness to a worsening situation in
that neighborhood. In actuality,
the reverse has been true.
To begin with, the University's
policy of housing large numbers
of students, faculty and staff on
the campus has helped reduce the
commute flow. Student housing
has increased 44 percent since
1957-58, and faculty-staff housing
by 250 percent, both at a far
faster rate than the increase in size
of those bodies. The 225-unit
Frenchman's Terrace
low-moderate income housing
project also lies ahead, as does a
100-unit emeritus housing
development.
More directly, Stanford has
developed a road system over the
past several years that has helped
protect College Terrace from cars
destined for the campus. Before
1964, the major entrance and exit
from the east was by way of
Escondido Road, directly across
Stanford Avenue from College
Terrace. This meant that virtually
all traffic approaching the
University from that area had to
go through or close by College
Terrace.
In 1964, the first of two new
routes to the north and south of
that neighborhood was opened
when Serra Street was extended
from Campus Drive to El Camino
Real. A total of 2210 vehicles a
day used the new entrance that
year; seven years later, the count
was up to 8440.
Traffic Jump
In 1967, Bowdoin Street was
extended from Stanford Avenue
to Campus Drive, near the south
end of College Terrace. Traffic
there jumped from 850 cars a day
during the first year to 7500 in
1973.
As more vehicles began using
the entrances to the campus at the
"ends" of College Terrace, the
number using the entrance at the
"middle" — Escondido Road —
dropped form 5500 cars a day in
1964 to 4100 in 1973. With the
University's closure of that road
last year to protect the schools
and student residential areas on
either side, even those 4100
vehicles are now forced to find
access to the campus elsewhere,
still further reducing the impact
on the College Terrace.
Least Possible Impact
The University's actions of
course have been taken to handle
traffic with the least possible
impact upon student and
faculty-staff residential areas. At
the same time, however, those
steps have benefitted our

neighbors to the east.
University representatives also
have worked carefully with Palo
Alto over the years on traffic and
related matters. The construction,
extension and blocking of campus
streets affecting the city are
discussed well in advance with
city planners and engineers.
When the University proposed
the Frenchman's Hill faculty-staff
subdivision in 1967, only Santa
Clara County approval of the
project was required. The
University called a meeting for
College Terrace residents,
however, and took the plans to
the City Planning Commission and
City Council as a courtesy. As a
result of those meetings, changes
were made in the design of
Stanford Avenue and Peter Coutts
Road in the subdivision.
New Intersection Resisted
It is true that the University
has resisted construction of a new
intersection at Bowdoin and
Stanford that would divert all, or
most, Stanford Avenue traffic
onto the campus. The University
has done so for several reasons:
1. The problem that the
intersection originally was
proposed to correct in 1967 — the
possible heavy flow of traffic
from the campus, across Stanford
Avenue and onto Bowdoin in
College Terrace — did not
materialize.
2. No evidence has been
provided to show that an
intersection that did not divert all
Stanford Avenue traffic onto the
campus would be any more
effective in reducing traffic on
that street than presently available
means such as traffic lights and
stop signs.
3. Any plan to divert all
Stanford Avenue traffic onto the
campus would be highly unfair.
Most vehicles on Stanford Avenue
wish to travel to El Camino Real
or Junipero Serra Boulevard. To
force them to drive through
campus residential areas would
also be illogical and dangerous.
4. The intersection as proposed
would have cut far into a
greenbelt near campus homes.
5. The proposed Frenchman's
Terrace housing project would not
add enough traffic to require the
intersection, according to a City
study in 1972.
Substantial Problem
All of this is not to minimize
the traffic problem which still
remains in College Terrace, for it
is a substantial one. Hopefully
current plans to reduce traffic
there with new controls, and to
divert some Industrial Park traffic,
will be successful.
What this does report is the
many steps that have been taken

Andrew Doty

over the years to facilitate the
flow of students, staff, residents
and visitors to and from the
campus, and how those steps have
helped ease the problem in
College Terrace. At the same time,
the University has been willing to
accept its share of transient traffic
as motorists "vote with their
steering wheels" at Stanford and
Bowdoin. It indicates that
Stanford has taken the position it
has regarding the proposed
Stanford-Bowdoin intersection
not out of apathy or
intransigence, but rather for
reasons that probably would
prove persuasive to any other
community finding itself faced
with the same request.

3. Any plan to divert all
Stanford Avenue traffic onto the
campus would be highly unfair.
Most vehicles on Stanford Avenue
wish to travel to El Camino Real
or Junipero Serra Boulevard. To
force them to drive through
campus residential areas would
also be illogical and dangerous.
4. The intersection as proposed
would have cut far into a
greenbelt near campus homes.
5. The proposed Frenchman's
Terrace housing project would not
add enough traffic to require the
intersection, according to a City
study in 1972.
Substantial Problem
All of this is not to minimize
the traffic problem which still
remains in College Terrace, for it
is a substantial one. Hopefully
current plans to reduce traffic
there with new controls, and to
divert some Industrial Park traffic,
will be successful.
What this does report is the
many steps that have been taken

Andrew Doty

over the years to facilitate the
flow of students, staff, residents
and visitors to and from the
campus, and how those steps have
helped ease the problem in
College Terrace. At the same time,
the University has been willing to
accept its share of transient traffic
as motorists "vote with their
steering wheels" at Stanford and
Bowdoin. It indicates that
Stanford has taken the position it
has regarding the proposed
Stanford-Bowdoin intersection
not out of apathy or
intransigence, but rather for
reasons that probably would
prove persuasive to any other
community finding itself faced
with the same request.

University community relations.)
During the current discussion
of the College Terrace traffic
problem, the impression
sometimes is given that Stanford
has been a passive and uncaring
witness to a worsening situation in
that neighborhood. In actuality,
the reverse has been true.
To begin with, the University's
policy of housing large numbers
of students, faculty and staff on
the campus has helped reduce the
commute flow. Student housing
has increased 44 percent since
1957-58, and faculty-staff housing
by 250 percent, both at a far
faster rate than the increase in size
of those bodies. The 225-unit
Frenchman's Terrace
low-moderate income housing
project also lies ahead, as does a
100-unit emeritus housing
development.
More directly, Stanford has
developed a road system over the
past several years that has helped
protect College Terrace from cars
destined for the campus. Before
1964, the major entrance and exit
from the east was by way of
Escondido Road, directly across
Stanford Avenue from College
Terrace. This meant that virtually
all traffic approaching the
University from that area had to
go through or close by College
Terrace.
In 1964, the first of two new
routes to the north and south of
that neighborhood was opened
when Serra Street was extended
from Campus Drive to El Camino
Real. A total of 2210 vehicles a
day used the new entrance that
year; seven years later, the count
was up to 8440.
Traffic Jump
In 1967, Bowdoin Street was
extended from Stanford Avenue
to Campus Drive, near the south
end of College Terrace. Traffic
there jumped from 850 cars a day
during the first year to 7500 in
1973.
As more vehicles began using
the entrances to the campus at the
"ends" of College Terrace, the
number using the entrance at the
"middle" — Escondido Road —
dropped form 5500 cars a day in
1964 to 4100 in 1973. With the
University's closure of that road
last year to protect the schools
and student residential areas on
either side, even those 4100
vehicles are now forced to find
access to the campus elsewhere,
still further reducing the impact
on the College Terrace.
Least Possible Impact
The University's actions of
course have been taken to handle
traffic with the least possible
impact upon student and
faculty-staff residential areas. At
the same time, however, those
steps have benefitted our

neighbors to the east.
University representatives also
have worked carefully with Palo
Alto over the years on traffic and
related matters. The construction,
extension and blocking of campus
streets affecting the city are
discussed well in advance with
city planners and engineers.
When the University proposed
the Frenchman's Hill faculty-staff
subdivision in 1967, only Santa
Clara County approval of the
project was required. The
University called a meeting for
College Terrace residents,
however, and took the plans to
the City Planning Commission and
City Council as a courtesy. As a
result of those meetings, changes
were made in the design of
Stanford Avenue and Peter Coutts
Road in the subdivision.
New Intersection Resisted
It is true that the University
has resisted construction of a new
intersection at Bowdoin and
Stanford that would divert all, or
most, Stanford Avenue traffic
onto the campus. The University
has done so for several reasons:
1. The problem that the
intersection originally was
proposed to correct in 1967 — the
possible heavy flow of traffic
from the campus, across Stanford
Avenue and onto Bowdoin in
College Terrace — did not
materialize.
2. No evidence has been
provided to show that an
intersection that did not divert all
Stanford Avenue traffic onto the
campus would be any more
effective in reducing traffic on
that street than presently available
means such as traffic lights and
stop signs.

impact upon student and
faculty-staff residential areas. At
the same time, however, those
steps have benefitted our

neighbors to the east.
University representatives also
have worked carefully with Palo
Alto over the years on traffic and
related matters. The construction,
extension and blocking of campus
streets affecting the city are
discussed well in advance with
city planners and engineers.
When the University proposed
the Frenchman's Hill faculty-staff
subdivision in 1967, only Santa
Clara County approval of the
project was required. The
University called a meeting for
College Terrace residents,
however, and took the plans to
the City Planning Commission and
City Council as a courtesy. As a
result of those meetings, changes
were made in the design of
Stanford Avenue and Peter Coutts
Road in the subdivision.
New Intersection Resisted
It is true that the University
has resisted construction of a new
intersection at Bowdoin and
Stanford that would divert all, or
most, Stanford Avenue traffic
onto the campus. The University
has done so for several reasons:
1. The problem that the
intersection originally was
proposed to correct in 1967 — the
possible heavy flow of traffic
from the campus, across Stanford
Avenue and onto Bowdoin in
College Terrace — did not
materialize.
2. No evidence has been
provided to show that an
intersection that did not divert all
Stanford Avenue traffic onto the
campus would be any more
effective in reducing traffic on
that street than presently available
means such as traffic lights and
stop signs.
3. Any plan to divert all
Stanford Avenue traffic onto the
campus would be highly unfair.
Most vehicles on Stanford Avenue
wish to travel to El Camino Real
or Junipero Serra Boulevard. To
force them to drive through
campus residential areas would
also be illogical and dangerous.
4. The intersection as proposed
would have cut far into a
greenbelt near campus homes.
5. The proposed Frenchman's
Terrace housing project would not
add enough traffic to require the
intersection, according to a City
study in 1972.
Substantial Problem
All of this is not to minimize
the traffic problem which still
remains in College Terrace, for it
is a substantial one. Hopefully
current plans to reduce traffic
there with new controls, and to
divert some Industrial Park traffic,
will be successful.
What this does report is the
many steps that have been taken

Andrew Doty

over the years to facilitate the
flow of students, staff, residents
and visitors to and from the
campus, and how those steps have
helped ease the problem in
College Terrace. At the same time,
the University has been willing to
accept its share of transient traffic
as motorists "vote with their
steering wheels" at Stanford and
Bowdoin. It indicates that
Stanford has taken the position it
has regarding the proposed
Stanford-Bowdoin intersection
not out of apathy or
intransigence, but rather for
reasons that probably would
prove persuasive to any other
community finding itself faced
with the same request.

University community relations.)
During the current discussion
of the College Terrace traffic
problem, the impression
sometimes is given that Stanford
has been a passive and uncaring
witness to a worsening situation in
that neighborhood. In actuality,
the reverse has been true.
To begin with, the University's
policy of housing large numbers
of students, faculty and staff on
the campus has helped reduce the
commute flow. Student housing
has increased 44 percent since
1957-58, and faculty-staff housing
by 250 percent, both at a far
faster rate than the increase in size
of those bodies. The 225-unit
Frenchman's Terrace
low-moderate income housing
project also lies ahead, as does a
100-unit emeritus housing
development.
More directly, Stanford has
developed a road system over the
past several years that has helped
protect College Terrace from cars
destined for the campus. Before
1964, the major entrance and exit
from the east was by way of
Escondido Road, directly across
Stanford Avenue from College
Terrace. This meant that virtually
all traffic approaching the
University from that area had to
go through or close by College
Terrace.
In 1964, the first of two new
routes to the north and south of
that neighborhood was opened
when Serra Street was extended
from Campus Drive to El Camino
Real. A total of 2210 vehicles a
day used the new entrance that
year; seven years later, the count
was up to 8440.
Traffic Jump
In 1967, Bowdoin Street was
extended from Stanford Avenue
to Campus Drive, near the south
end of College Terrace. Traffic
there jumped from 850 cars a day
during the first year to 7500 in
1973.
As more vehicles began using
the entrances to the campus at the
"ends" of College Terrace, the
number using the entrance at the
"middle" — Escondido Road —
dropped form 5500 cars a day in
1964 to 4100 in 1973. With the
University's closure of that road
last year to protect the schools
and student residential areas on
either side, even those 4100
vehicles are now forced to find
access to the campus elsewhere,
still further reducing the impact
on the College Terrace.
Least Possible Impact
The University's actions of
course have been taken to handle
traffic with the least possible
impact upon student and
faculty-staff residential areas. At
the same time, however, those
steps have benefitted our

neighbors to the east.
