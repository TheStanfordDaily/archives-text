# ASSU Election Proposals
## 
### 
MiJce Herman

At the March 5 ASSU Senate meeting, a report
was presented by the students composing the ASSU
Committee on Committees, charged with
investigating means by which student participation
within the University committee structure could be
improved and by which the contact between
student committee members and elected student
leaders could be increased.
The committee produced four recommendations
to facilitate the desired end.
The first two proposals relate directly to
prospective changes by the Nominations
Committee in its procedure for selecting students
to serve on University committees; they are changes
which last year's Nominations Committee deemed
necessary for smoother operation. The third
proposal would establish the office of
Committee-Staff Assistance, a coordinator of
informational flow between the ASSU governing
bodies and student members on University
committees; this is a concept that has been widely
endorsed, in spirit at least, by student leaders for
some time.
Rejection Desired
The final recommendation, however, should not
only stir up debate in the Senate but, hopefully,
will be rejected in light of objections against which
it should prove indefensible. The proposal amounts
to a revision of the ASSU electoral calendar, the
most significant change being the transfer of
senatorial elections from Autumn to Spring to
coincide with the presidential election and the
selection of a majority of the Nominations
Committee.
While the three other proposals received little
opposition in committee, there are enough defects
in this one that I could not support it .
The benefits enumerated by the proposal's
proponents amoung to the following: first, that
there would be "a closer and more responsible
relationship between the Senate, the members of
the Nominations Committee and the student
members on university committees; second, that
there would exist "a more responsible ASSU Senate
whose members are able to gain the necessary
expertise during the summer to be more effective";
finally, that there would be "a financial saving

without the separate election in the Fall."
Unsupportable Restatement
The first of these alleged benefits is merely a
restatement of what the committee was established
to create; it is unsupported and, indeed, appears
relatively unsuppor table. The increased expertise of
the Senate through its summer training is both
impractical and ridiculous, for historically, ASSU
senators have followed their constitutents in
departing shortly after the end of finals in June;
those remaining are confronted with such little
work pertaining to the ASSU that expertise is in no
way probable.
Rather, I see three disadvantages to the
proposal, any one of which is of more substnace
than any one of the supposed benefits. First, by
placing the Senatorial elections in the Spring, the
recommendation would, in effect, disenfranchise
one class (incoming freshmen) which will be
affected by the theoretically representative Senate,
while allowing another class (graduating seniors) to
vote for a body with which it will have only brief
association.
Secondly, there is the basic philosophical
question of whether the Nominations Committee
should be quite so dominated by and associated
with the Council of Presidents and the Senate. It is,
after all, the students on committees With whom
more interchange should be encouraged rather than
the body that places them there. In theory, at least,
the Nominations Committee is charged with
recommending the best candidates possible to sit
on University committees and not necessarily
friends of the Council of Presidents or of the
Senate or those members themselves.
Disastrous Effect
Finally, the psychological effect of having two
major elections compressed into one would be
disastrous to the ASSU in general and to the Senate
in particular. It is difficult to conceive of a marked
increase in the number of those voting in one large
election over the number in separate elections. The
opposite effect might be created: the vast amoung
of politicking by 60 to 70 Senate candidates and any
number of presidential slates would no doubt
nauseate more students than it would interest.

Unsupportable Restatement
The first of these alleged benefits is merely a
restatement of what the committee was established
to create; it is unsupported and, indeed, appears
relatively unsuppor table. The increased expertise of
the Senate through its summer training is both
impractical and ridiculous, for historically, ASSU
senators have followed their constitutents in
departing shortly after the end of finals in June;
those remaining are confronted with such little
work pertaining to the ASSU that expertise is in no
way probable.
Rather, I see three disadvantages to the
proposal, any one of which is of more substnace
than any one of the supposed benefits. First, by
placing the Senatorial elections in the Spring, the
recommendation would, in effect, disenfranchise
one class (incoming freshmen) which will be
affected by the theoretically representative Senate,
while allowing another class (graduating seniors) to
vote for a body with which it will have only brief
association.
Secondly, there is the basic philosophical
question of whether the Nominations Committee
should be quite so dominated by and associated
with the Council of Presidents and the Senate. It is,
after all, the students on committees With whom
more interchange should be encouraged rather than
the body that places them there. In theory, at least,
the Nominations Committee is charged with
recommending the best candidates possible to sit
on University committees and not necessarily
friends of the Council of Presidents or of the
Senate or those members themselves.
Disastrous Effect
Finally, the psychological effect of having two
major elections compressed into one would be
disastrous to the ASSU in general and to the Senate
in particular. It is difficult to conceive of a marked
increase in the number of those voting in one large
election over the number in separate elections. The
opposite effect might be created: the vast amoung
of politicking by 60 to 70 Senate candidates and any
number of presidential slates would no doubt
nauseate more students than it would interest.

At the March 5 ASSU Senate meeting, a report
was presented by the students composing the ASSU
Committee on Committees, charged with
investigating means by which student participation
within the University committee structure could be
improved and by which the contact between
student committee members and elected student
leaders could be increased.
The committee produced four recommendations
to facilitate the desired end.
The first two proposals relate directly to
prospective changes by the Nominations
Committee in its procedure for selecting students
to serve on University committees; they are changes
which last year's Nominations Committee deemed
necessary for smoother operation. The third
proposal would establish the office of
Committee-Staff Assistance, a coordinator of
informational flow between the ASSU governing
bodies and student members on University
committees; this is a concept that has been widely
endorsed, in spirit at least, by student leaders for
some time.
Rejection Desired
The final recommendation, however, should not
only stir up debate in the Senate but, hopefully,
will be rejected in light of objections against which
it should prove indefensible. The proposal amounts
to a revision of the ASSU electoral calendar, the
most significant change being the transfer of
senatorial elections from Autumn to Spring to
coincide with the presidential election and the
selection of a majority of the Nominations
Committee.
While the three other proposals received little
opposition in committee, there are enough defects
in this one that I could not support it .
The benefits enumerated by the proposal's
proponents amoung to the following: first, that
there would be "a closer and more responsible
relationship between the Senate, the members of
the Nominations Committee and the student
members on university committees; second, that
there would exist "a more responsible ASSU Senate
whose members are able to gain the necessary
expertise during the summer to be more effective";
finally, that there would be "a financial saving

without the separate election in the Fall."
