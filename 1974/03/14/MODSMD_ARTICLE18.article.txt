# Big Oil's Charade
## 
### 
Gregory Davis

The wealth, special privileges,
and power of Big Oil in the
United States are unmatched by
any other interests. The top 33 oil
companies in the top 500 U.S.
corporations constitute one-third
of the total earnings of this group.
In 1973, corporate profits in the
U.S. rose 27 percent, oil profits
55 percent!
These profits are based on
special privileges which have been
obtained by amazingly effective
political clout. Until the quotas
on what used to be cheaper
foreign crude oil were recently
removed, American consumers
had to fork out an extra $5 billion
per year for artificially
higher-priced U.S. oil.
The petroleum industry also
benefits from the famous
depletion rilowance, which in the
1960's deprived the government of
nearly $1.3 billion in tax revenue
yearly. The foreign tax credit
allows U.S. oil companies to write
off, dollar for dollar, royalties
paid to foreign governments as
"taxes" (in 1970 $2.3 billion in
U.S. tax revenue was lost).
Generally, oil companies have a
tax rate 50 percent less than that
of other manufacturing firms.
Profiteering And Pollution
While making fantastic profits
and exploiting the U.S. consumer
with monopoly prices, the oil
companies pollute our coastal
waters and seas, lobby against
rapid transit legistlation which
would lessen dependence on the
automobile, bankroll pro-oil
political candidates ($5 million to
Nixon in 1972), and use their
enormous resources to block
proposed anti-pollution laws and
initiatives. Oil profits are more
important than public health.
There is much evidence that
the "energy crisis" (which the oil
companies "announced" several
times and without significant
success before the War of Yom
Kippur) is a phony, massive
swindle perpetrated on the
American people. Senate
investigation has shown that oil
companies deliberately cut back
on refining output to cause
shortages in 1972 and 1973.
Evidence was also found which
indicated the famous international
cartel (five out of seven members
are American firms) conspired to
limit production abroad. The
press reported U.S. crude oil
imports for the period
October-December were higher
than in 1972, although the Arab
embargo on exports was blamed
for shortages.
Huge Charade
This huge charade is beginning
to bear fruit. The Nixon
Administration has called for a

1000 percent increase in offshore
drilling; has approved
construction of the Alaska
pipleine; has announced plans to
lease shale oil tracts in Utah,
Wyoming, and Colorado; has
asked Congress to approve a
multi-million dollar public subsidy
for "energy research" to the oil
companies; and has generally
helped organize the myth of the
"energy crisis" among the
merican people. In a remarkable
display of doublethink logic,
Nixon announced that he had
vetoed a gasoline price rollback
"because it would cause long gas
lines."
American oil companies are
really energy companies. They
already account for 25 percent of
U.S. coal production (U.S. coal
reserves are estimated at five times
world oil reserves) and own 48
percent of the world's uranium
reserves. The purpose of the
"energy crisis" is to drive up oil
prices and increase public
financial support for oil
companies to finance expanded
operations in the petroleum area
and conversion to other forms of
energy.
If crude oil sells at eight to 10
dollars a barrel, extraction of
shale oil and automated
extraction and distillation of coal
will be profitable. Conversion into
other energy fields is also to be
financed by billions of taxpayer
dollars, allocated in the federal
budget to oil companies.
Greedy Plunder
This greedy and selfish plunder
of American resources and
Americans' earnings must be
stopped. Although the ultimate
solution to our reckless waste of
natural resources involves new
values and a new life style and
institutions, a more immediate
solution imposes itself as far as
the oil companies are concerned.
They must be nationalized as
soon as possible, and progressive
politicians must be encouraged to
work for this goal. A federal
disclosure law (at present only the
oil companies know how much oil
they have), or creation of a
government petroleum
corporation to "compete" with
the oil companies are only
half-measures which the oil
companies themselves will
ultimately support to pacify an
angry but credulous citizenry.
If the American people do not
face up to Big Oil now, they can
expect to be subjected more
frequently to the same kind of
blackmail by other powerful
corporate interests also
controlling essential commodities
or services.

Wyoming, and Colorado; has
asked Congress to approve a
multi-million dollar public subsidy
for "energy research" to the oil
companies; and has generally
helped organize the myth of the
"energy crisis" among the
merican people. In a remarkable
display of doublethink logic,
Nixon announced that he had
vetoed a gasoline price rollback
"because it would cause long gas
lines."
American oil companies are
really energy companies. They
already account for 25 percent of
U.S. coal production (U.S. coal
reserves are estimated at five times
world oil reserves) and own 48
percent of the world's uranium
reserves. The purpose of the
"energy crisis" is to drive up oil
prices and increase public
financial support for oil
companies to finance expanded
operations in the petroleum area
and conversion to other forms of
energy.
If crude oil sells at eight to 10
dollars a barrel, extraction of
shale oil and automated
extraction and distillation of coal
will be profitable. Conversion into
other energy fields is also to be
financed by billions of taxpayer
dollars, allocated in the federal
budget to oil companies.
Greedy Plunder
This greedy and selfish plunder
of American resources and
Americans' earnings must be
stopped. Although the ultimate
solution to our reckless waste of
natural resources involves new
values and a new life style and
institutions, a more immediate
solution imposes itself as far as
the oil companies are concerned.
They must be nationalized as
soon as possible, and progressive
politicians must be encouraged to
work for this goal. A federal
disclosure law (at present only the
oil companies know how much oil
they have), or creation of a
government petroleum
corporation to "compete" with
the oil companies are only
half-measures which the oil
companies themselves will
ultimately support to pacify an
angry but credulous citizenry.
If the American people do not
face up to Big Oil now, they can
expect to be subjected more
frequently to the same kind of
blackmail by other powerful
corporate interests also
controlling essential commodities
or services.

The wealth, special privileges,
and power of Big Oil in the
United States are unmatched by
any other interests. The top 33 oil
companies in the top 500 U.S.
corporations constitute one-third
of the total earnings of this group.
In 1973, corporate profits in the
U.S. rose 27 percent, oil profits
55 percent!
These profits are based on
special privileges which have been
obtained by amazingly effective
political clout. Until the quotas
on what used to be cheaper
foreign crude oil were recently
removed, American consumers
had to fork out an extra $5 billion
per year for artificially
higher-priced U.S. oil.
The petroleum industry also
benefits from the famous
depletion rilowance, which in the
1960's deprived the government of
nearly $1.3 billion in tax revenue
yearly. The foreign tax credit
allows U.S. oil companies to write
off, dollar for dollar, royalties
paid to foreign governments as
"taxes" (in 1970 $2.3 billion in
U.S. tax revenue was lost).
Generally, oil companies have a
tax rate 50 percent less than that
of other manufacturing firms.
Profiteering And Pollution
While making fantastic profits
and exploiting the U.S. consumer
with monopoly prices, the oil
companies pollute our coastal
waters and seas, lobby against
rapid transit legistlation which
would lessen dependence on the
automobile, bankroll pro-oil
political candidates ($5 million to
Nixon in 1972), and use their
enormous resources to block
proposed anti-pollution laws and
initiatives. Oil profits are more
important than public health.
There is much evidence that
the "energy crisis" (which the oil
companies "announced" several
times and without significant
success before the War of Yom
Kippur) is a phony, massive
swindle perpetrated on the
American people. Senate
investigation has shown that oil
companies deliberately cut back
on refining output to cause
shortages in 1972 and 1973.
Evidence was also found which
indicated the famous international
cartel (five out of seven members
are American firms) conspired to
limit production abroad. The
press reported U.S. crude oil
imports for the period
October-December were higher
than in 1972, although the Arab
embargo on exports was blamed
for shortages.
Huge Charade
This huge charade is beginning
to bear fruit. The Nixon
Administration has called for a

1000 percent increase in offshore
drilling; has approved
construction of the Alaska
pipleine; has announced plans to
lease shale oil tracts in Utah,
Wyoming, and Colorado; has
asked Congress to approve a
multi-million dollar public subsidy

companies; and has generally

on what used to be cheaper
foreign crude oil were recently
removed, American consumers
had to fork out an extra $5 billion
per year for artificially
higher-priced U.S. oil.
The petroleum industry also
benefits from the famous
depletion rilowance, which in the
1960's deprived the government of
nearly $1.3 billion in tax revenue
yearly. The foreign tax credit
allows U.S. oil companies to write
off, dollar for dollar, royalties
paid to foreign governments as
"taxes" (in 1970 $2.3 billion in
U.S. tax revenue was lost).
Generally, oil companies have a
tax rate 50 percent less than that
of other manufacturing firms.
Profiteering And Pollution
While making fantastic profits
and exploiting the U.S. consumer
with monopoly prices, the oil
companies pollute our coastal
waters and seas, lobby against
rapid transit legistlation which
would lessen dependence on the
automobile, bankroll pro-oil
political candidates ($5 million to
Nixon in 1972), and use their
enormous resources to block
proposed anti-pollution laws and
initiatives. Oil profits are more
important than public health.
There is much evidence that
the "energy crisis" (which the oil
companies "announced" several
times and without significant
success before the War of Yom
Kippur) is a phony, massive
swindle perpetrated on the
American people. Senate
investigation has shown that oil
companies deliberately cut back
on refining output to cause
shortages in 1972 and 1973.
Evidence was also found which
indicated the famous international
cartel (five out of seven members
are American firms) conspired to
limit production abroad. The
press reported U.S. crude oil
imports for the period
October-December were higher
than in 1972, although the Arab
embargo on exports was blamed
for shortages.
Huge Charade
This huge charade is beginning
to bear fruit. The Nixon
Administration has called for a

1000 percent increase in offshore
drilling; has approved
construction of the Alaska
pipleine; has announced plans to
lease shale oil tracts in Utah,
Wyoming, and Colorado; has
asked Congress to approve a
multi-million dollar public subsidy
for "energy research" to the oil
companies; and has generally
helped organize the myth of the
"energy crisis" among the
merican people. In a remarkable
display of doublethink logic,
Nixon announced that he had
vetoed a gasoline price rollback
"because it would cause long gas
lines."
American oil companies are
really energy companies. They
already account for 25 percent of
U.S. coal production (U.S. coal
reserves are estimated at five times
world oil reserves) and own 48
percent of the world's uranium
reserves. The purpose of the
"energy crisis" is to drive up oil
prices and increase public
financial support for oil
companies to finance expanded
operations in the petroleum area
and conversion to other forms of
energy.
If crude oil sells at eight to 10
dollars a barrel, extraction of
shale oil and automated
extraction and distillation of coal
will be profitable. Conversion into
other energy fields is also to be
financed by billions of taxpayer
dollars, allocated in the federal
budget to oil companies.
Greedy Plunder
This greedy and selfish plunder
of American resources and
Americans' earnings must be
stopped. Although the ultimate
solution to our reckless waste of
natural resources involves new
values and a new life style and
institutions, a more immediate
solution imposes itself as far as
the oil companies are concerned.
They must be nationalized as
soon as possible, and progressive
politicians must be encouraged to
work for this goal. A federal
disclosure law (at present only the
oil companies know how much oil
they have), or creation of a
government petroleum
corporation to "compete" with
the oil companies are only
half-measures which the oil
companies themselves will
ultimately support to pacify an
angry but credulous citizenry.
If the American people do not
face up to Big Oil now, they can
expect to be subjected more
frequently to the same kind of
blackmail by other powerful
corporate interests also
controlling essential commodities
or services.
