Marxist Courses
Editor:
In reference to the question of
Stanford's course offerings in
Marxist theory, I have checked
this year's courses in the
departments of economics,
philosophy, and political science
against those currently offered in
these same departments at
Berkeley and Harvard. The results
are as follows:
Berkeley: the best
inter-departmental balance of the
three schools, with one
undergraduate course each in
economics and philosophy, and a
graduate course in political
science. Total: three courses.
Harvard: nothing in philosophy
or political science, but two
undergraduate and one graduate
course in economics. Total:
three courses.
Stanford: nothing in
philosophy, one graduate course
(open to undergraduates) in
political science, and two courses
(one undergraduate, one graduate)
in economics, both taught by
Professor Gurley. Total:
three courses.
If f.nd when Professor Gurley's
courses are eliminated, as is
threatened, this University's
offerings in Marxist theory will
total one course. Stanford will
then rank on a par with the
University of Mississippi, which
offers a graduate philosophy
course in Marxism and
Democratic Theory, and with
Louisiana State Univeristy, which
offers an undergraduate
economics course in The
Economics of Collectivism
(including the Marxist theory of
capitalism).
This state of affairs, for a
university with pretensions to
greatness, will be, I submit, a
scandal.

Abortion
Editor:
I applaude the article by Eila
Skinner |Daily, March 81 for her

raising of a point which I believe
has been neglected from the
beginning of the abortionissue.
Concern, or lack thereof, seems to
be focused on the rights of the
fetus. No one asks about the
woman who must endure the nine
months of gestation and its
accompanying side effects.
There are valid arguments on*
both sides of the issue, but neither
side has taken the time to
consider that their wrong might
not be with determining the
appropriate regulative state of
abortion. Rather they are making
an attempt to force their personal
beliefs on antoher individual.
Abortion should be available to
any woman on demand. Particular
attention should be paid to the
word "available," this places
abortion in the category of an
option. There would be no
mandatory nature to the issue.
With this state of affairs a woman
may simply choose whether or
not to use the procedure; in
conjunction with her own beliefs
and not those of some imposed
system.
The concurrence of a qualified
gynecologist should be the
solitary restriction placed on this
freedom. The setting up of such a
state will avoid external politics
and emotional feelings so that
women would gain the degreee of
bodily freedom they wish.

Heckled Heckler
Editor:
While Kate Millett's talk last
week was excellent, the presence
of the woman who interrupted
her told as much about the
condition of women in our
society as Millett's words. One
young man commented, "Well,
she'd obviously blown a fuse."
The questions we need to ask
ourselves are what was the woman
really saying, and what did the
various reactions to her tell us
about what's going on?
While I didn't agree with the
words the woman spoke, I did see
in her an obvious need. She was
clearly unhappy with her life and
frustrated by her inability to do
anything about it. She needed,
like most people, to be
recognized, listened to, and
sympathized with — not simply
on her political viewpoints but
more on her personal life
frustrations. Millett was good; she
listened and made an attempt to
answer the woman's questions and
accusations. The audience,
however, was another story.
From the beginning, the
audience booed and hissed at the
woman. By the time Millett called
afor questions and the woman
began to talk, the audience was
aggressively and violently shouting
at her to "shut up."
This was clearly not an isolated
incident — this woman was all

women and her situation that
night was our situation every day.
Her treatment was an immediate
example of the isolation and
hostility of the society about
which Millett spoke (and about
which the audience chuckled and
nodded knowingly).
The woman needed to be heard
and the audience suppressed her.
Even more insidious, she was
casually dismissed as crazy. She
was a victim of the intolerant
forces in society and few people
caught it.
Our struggle is obviously a
deep one — one of oppressive
attitudes entrenched even in the
audience last week which one
would suppose consisted of those
people most sympathetic to
feminism and social change.

Cohn And Competition
Editor:
With reference to Prof. Cohn's
remarks in the March 7 Daily, I
think it important to note that
while the benefits of competition
for the advancement of society in
a purely technological sense are
hard to refute, certainly any
reasonable man, with the
spectacle now before him of the
awful havoc wrought by
unprincipled men of unbridled
competitiveness, should begin to
doubt how sound be the values
instilled by such a system of
competition.

Joshua Goldstein may be right
to suggest that educational
systems now switch their
emphasis from competition to
cooperation. Certainly when one
set of values breaks down, there
would appear to be less harm in
trying something new than in
persisting with the old way.
I cannot help adding, as an
aside, how appalling it is to see
such petty slogans and trite slurs
as those which drop from the pen
of the distinguished Stanford
professor. Perhaps just one further
indication that the competitive
system in use until now has not
educated people in some of the
finer points of discourse.

Frisbee Correction
Editor:
Several weeks ago, an article
appeared in the Daily about me
concerning Ultimate Frisbee. In
the article, I was quoted as saying
that "Wham-0 stole our game."
At the time, I did not think of
writing a disclaimer, as the Daily
is a relatively small newspaper
with a rather limited circulation.
However, I have recently found
out that the managers of Wham-0
Manufacturers, Inc. were very
upset by the article.
I would like to say that the
above quote was false. What I told
the reporter was that Wham-0
came out with a game very similar

to ours the same year that we came
out with ours. If 1 in any way
seemed to imply that they "stole
our game," I would like to
apologize.
Thank you.

Actions, Not Promises
Editor:
I find Bill Evers' naivete
concerning Soviet disarmament
proposals (Daily, March 7) a little
hard to believe. I guess it's
because I've always viewed actions
and not promises as reliable
indicators of character, whether
of people or of governments. And
the actions of the Soviet
government have made it a little
hard for me to believe that they
have any higher interest than the
maintenance and expansion of
their authoritarian rule, using
military and secret police power.
I remember actions like those
in Hungary. I remember
Czechoslovakia. I remember the
Baltic countries. I remember the
Russian Jews and Alexander
Solzheinitsyn. All these things say
something important to me about
the character of the Soviets.
Certainly I'd like to see bilateral
disarmament, but I'm honestly
not very hopeful.
I'm afraid I'm not as
enthusiastic as Evers seems to be
about dismantling our defense
system on the Soviet promise that
they will follow suit. It's all a
little suspicious when the Soviet
Defense Minister states that "the
Soviet Union should remain wary
of East-West detente and increase
spending on its military might"
(same March 7 issue).
I have to admit some personal
prejudice in the matter. Although
I'm too young to have
experienced in myself, my parents
were Latvian refugees who fled
Soviet oppression during World
War 11. They have some
interesting stories to tell. I would
suggest that Evers sometime take

a few minutes to talk with people
like my parents who have had
more than a little personal
experience with the
trustworthiness of Soviet
promises.

Daily Litter
Editor:
The Stanford Daily is a
litterbug! Bundles of newspapers
are dropped in front of buildings
all over campus, no matter the
wind or weather. The front of the
R&D Center, for example, looks
like a trash heap due to the
accumulation of newsprint strewn
by gentle California winds. Surely
it must be possible to provide
some sort of racks to stop
polluting with papers.

Band Cheer
Editor:
During the recent USC
basketball game, I was witness to
a LSJUMB salute which I
would like explained.
Either it was a reconstructed
Nazi salute which would be
deplorable, or it was the Klingon
war salute, in which case I shall
cheer even at the price of four to
six dollars each day for a week.
Please clarify.

Caves And Berries
Editor:
If it were not for
"unimportant" scientists and
engineers, fuzzy-studies types like
John Siirila (Daily, March 5)
would be out on their bare asses,
living in caves and eating berries.
