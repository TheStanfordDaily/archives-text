# University To Discard Photo IDs
## 
### RONALD BECK 
The Stanford picture card ID will
be eliminated in fall quarter, 1974.
According to Registrar Sally Mahoney,
budgetary limitations necessitate the
change to a simpler card.
For r>rpserfr academic year,
i ,U L > i, CI Lj yLu
picture IDs for students, each costing
over $1. Next year's budget provides
substantially less money for the IDs.
Mahoney says that, "At a time
when we are having an acute shortage
of money to spend, cutting out the
picture ID card seems like a practical
idea."
The present picture ID has been in
use for four years. A "fairly simple"
ID was used before. "We've explored
the uses of the ID card, and found that
there was no University service other
than Food Services that really had a
need for a picture ID," Mahoney says.
She adds that the cost of a picture ID
"will have to be absorbed within their
[Food Services] own budget."
Maxine Anderson, Manager of
University Food Services, admits that
a picture card is an "absolute
necessity" for Food Service
subscribers. Food Services has no
alternative but to put out a picture
card for their subscribers, according to
Anderson.
Anderson estimates that five or six
thousand dollars will be added yearly
to the Food Services budget to finance
the cards. $1200 previously spent on
labels for student IDs would
compensate for part of the cost, the
rest supported by a price rise in the
meal plans.
According to Mahoney, the picture
IDs were instituted four years ago to
facilitate student identification by
libraries, the athletic department, the
campus bank, bookstore, and food
services. The only services which
presently prefer the picture ID are the
bank, bookstore and food service.
But Mahoney contends that every
student who does business with them
can present other identification. "In
California, anyone who doesn't have a
driver's license for identification can
go to the Department of Motor
Vehicles and get a valid non-driver's
California identification card," she
says.
The libraries want a charge card
type ID, and "as long as that's not
what we have, they don't really care,"
according to Mahoney.
As it stands now, the actual details
of the card are yet to be determined.
However, Mahoney maintains, "There
will definitely be a Stanford student
body ID card. The card will be
changed every quarter for the general
student body, and every semester for
the law school, because of its different
schedule."

Vehicles and get a valid non-driver's
California identification card," she
says.
The libraries want a charge card
type ID, and "as long as that's not
what we have, they don't really care,"
according to Mahoney.
As it stands now, the actual details
of the card are yet to be determined.
However, Mahoney maintains, "There
will definitely be a Stanford student
body ID card. The card will be
changed every quarter for the general
student body, and every semester for
the law school, because of its different
schedule."
The Stanford picture card ID will
be eliminated in fall quarter, 1974.
According to Registrar Sally Mahoney,
budgetary limitations necessitate the
change to a simpler card.
For r>rpserfr academic year,

picture IDs for students, each costing
over $1. Next year's budget provides
substantially less money for the IDs.
Mahoney says that, "At a time
when we are having an acute shortage
of money to spend, cutting out the
picture ID card seems like a practical
idea."
The present picture ID has been in
use for four years. A "fairly simple"
ID was used before. "We've explored
the uses of the ID card, and found that
there was no University service other
than Food Services that really had a
need for a picture ID," Mahoney says.
She adds that the cost of a picture ID
"will have to be absorbed within their
[Food Services] own budget."
Maxine Anderson, Manager of
University Food Services, admits that
a picture card is an "absolute
necessity" for Food Service
subscribers. Food Services has no
alternative but to put out a picture
card for their subscribers, according to
Anderson.
Anderson estimates that five or six
thousand dollars will be added yearly
to the Food Services budget to finance
the cards. $1200 previously spent on
labels for student IDs would
compensate for part of the cost, the
rest supported by a price rise in the
meal plans.
According to Mahoney, the picture
IDs were instituted four years ago to
facilitate student identification by
libraries, the athletic department, the
campus bank, bookstore, and food
services. The only services which
presently prefer the picture ID are the
bank, bookstore and food service.
But Mahoney contends that every
student who does business with them
can present other identification. "In
California, anyone who doesn't have a
driver's license for identification can
go to the Department of Motor
Vehicles and get a valid non-driver's
California identification card," she
says.
The libraries want a charge card
type ID, and "as long as that's not
what we have, they don't really care,"
according to Mahoney.
As it stands now, the actual details
of the card are yet to be determined.
However, Mahoney maintains, "There
will definitely be a Stanford student
body ID card. The card will be
