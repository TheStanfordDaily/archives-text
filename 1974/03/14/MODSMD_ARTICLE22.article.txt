# Women's Day Fair Spans Wide Range Of Interests
## 
### 
Last week's International
Women's Day Fair brought both
elation and some disappointment
to its organizers.
"I think it was a great success,"
said Cary Ridder, a coordinator
for the fair's five days of
activities. ASSU Vice President
Beth Garfield agreed.
But both women expressed
disappointment that more
Stanford undergraduate women
had not participated. "I think
Stanford women still think
they're going to make it," Ridder
speculated. "It's not until you've
been out in the world for a while
that you see what you're really up
against."
The fair's varied events
included speeches by such
nationally prominent figures as
Kate Millett and Herbert Marc use,
as well as other speeches,
workshops and discussions with
individuals in a wide range of
professions and life situations.
Speeches
In a speech Thursday night, Jill
Johnston, author of Lesbian
Nation, said all women are both
mothers and daughters. Today's
lesbian movement, she said, is the
first collective effort to take the
part of the daughter.
Johnston said she no longer
discusses the women's movement
with men. "The only political
tactic I find viable is for women
to commit themselves to other
women," she said.
Mary Daly, associate professor
of theology at Boston College,
said in her Friday speech that
America is "a rapist society.
Women, she insisted, can only
survive by bonding together.
"The women's revolution is a
covenant, an agreement based on
a promise in ourselves," she said.
"It is a 'sisterhood of man,' a
non-rapist relationship to our
self."
Panels
In two panels on psychology,
"Women in Psychotherapy" and
"Dimensions in Transpersonal
Psychology," panelists spoke of
the failure of traditional therapy
in treating women. Therapy
groups, functioning as both
political and therapeutic tools,
have been one reaction to this
failure.
In Saturday's "Working
Women's Roundtable Discussion,"
panelists, all union members,
distinguished between the goals of
working women and those of
what one panelist called the
largely middle-class,
professionally-oriented women's
liberation movement.
But the women's movement
has affected working women, the
panelists agreed. Nellie Ward,
describing the six-month-old Sears
strike, said, "Seventy-five percent
of the strikers are women. A
couple of years ago I don't think
they would have stuck it out."
Members of the feminist law
firm of Davis, Dunlap & Williams
urged women to seek remedies to
discrimination through the courts
in the "Women's Rights in the
Courts" conference. They
cautioned women against thinking
of others before considering their
own rights. "Being nice is such a
detrimental thing," said Nancy
Davis, a partner in the San
Francisco firm.
University Women
The closed world of
professional cliques, poor
counseling, the implicit bias of
male interviewers seeking "their
own kind" and unliberated friends

were named as agents of
discrimination at the panel
discussion "Women in the
University: Is There
Discrimination?"
Diane Fields, second year law
student and former ASSU
co-president, suggested that
friends who have accepted
stereotypes discourage minority
women seeking to break out of
them.
Provost William Miller pointed
out that men also faced social
pressure from friends, but
suggested better counseling at the
university would lead to more
women in the professions.
Ann Miner, Stanford
affirmative action officer, listed
three main types of discrimination
she believes hold back qualified
women. She said "institutional
non-policy" permits the informal
exclusion of females because there
is no explicit hiring policy.
Discrimination also occurs when
job opportunities are known only
to a closed group of professionals
who perceive the hiree as a
"bright young man." Other
discriminatory practices denying
jobs to women stem directly from
stereotypes, she said.
Breaking Into Polities
"The first thing you have to
understand about women in
politics is that women are not in
politics," Miriam Goodman,
founder of the San Francisco
chapter of the Women's National
Political Caucus, told the audience
at a panel on "Women and the
Political Process."
This fact was reiterated by her
fellow panelists on Wednesday
and in separate talks by two
female political candidates on
Friday. The office seekers and
panelists focused on two main
issues which they said could help
women break the power barrier:
internal party reform, and
campaign financing and spending
restrictions.
Female political hopefuls must
overcome such obstacles as lack of
money, lack of political acumen,
the attitude of the press, their
own conditioning, and the fact
that they must often run against
incumbents. This list was
corroborated by Cathy O'Neill,
candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Secretary of State
in California, Suzanne Paizis, who
ran for state Senate in 1972, and
Maya Miller, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senator from Nevada.
Miller said, "Money goes where
backers think success is. They do
not advance money on idealism."
According to O'Neill, "Money
is the single most important factor

in state elections. Incumbents
raise 300 percent more money
than the challenger, and 98
percent of the incumbents are
men," She, like most of the
speakers, advocated public
financing and spending limits for
campaigns, which would aid
low-budget candidates such as
women.
Another difficulty facing
women office seekers is the press,
the speakers said. When O'Neill,
who sits on a state commission, a
Los Angeles city commission, the
Board of Directors of the state
Democratic Party, and teaches at
USC, announced her candidacy,
one paper headlined,
"Homemaker Seeks State Post."
"The news media often ask
questions of women candidates
they would never ask men,"
O'Neill said, "such as 'What will
happen to your children if you are
elected?' "
In order to overcome such
public scepticism, Paizis asserted,
"women have to be twice as good.
They have to have the statistics,
the data, do their homework."
It is precisely this kind of
doing "their homework" that has
given women what little political
leverage they have so far,
according to Miller. Nearly 40
percent of the delegates at the
1972 Democratic National
Convention were women because,
"We actually read the rules. The
very fact that we knew what was
in those rules constituted the
power to put them into effect,"
she said.
Marian Ash, Sacramento
lobbyist and editor of Skirting the
Capitol, a newsletter about
legislation relating to women,
insisted women do have influence
with male politicians. She said 50
male legislators had contacted her
to help draft a women's bill for
them to propose. Paizis added,
"Just the fact that women run
against them has made these men
believers."
Panel participants agreed that
social conditioning made women
shy away from the "dirty
business" of partisan politics.
"Qualities of leadership are male
qualities. That does mean women
have to change," said Goodman.
However, panelists added, an
injection of women into
government would probably
change politics as much as it
would change women. "We have
the potential for absolutely
tremendous political power,"
Paizis said, "And what that power
can do is make this country a
better place to live."
Lesbian Life
"We have found a more

comfortable home in the women's
movement than in the gay
movement," said Del Martin
during a Saturday night discussion
of "The Realities of
Homosexuality." Martin and
Phyllis Lyon, co-authors of
Lesbian Woman, were part of a
six-person discussion panel.
"There is a split between gay
men and gay women, just as
between straight men and straight
women," said Lyon. "As lesbians,
we also have the problem of being
discriminated against as women."
"What our liberation
movements are trying to do is say
that we're diverse people," added
Lyon. Each person has something
to contribute to society, and the
diversity only enriches human
potential, the panelists said.
This theme was also
emphasized by Dr. Don Clark, a
clinical psychologist specializing
in counseling gay men. "Gay is an
ability, not a disability. It is
something you can do, not
something you can't do," he said.
In a society which he said

values conformity more than
individuality, "the love possible
between women and the love
possible between men is
dangerous to the power
structure ... It leaves us
vulnerable to a world of
co-operation and peace."
Women As Prisoners
The oppressive injustices
women suffer in prison are merely
a magnification of the injustices
women in society are made to
bear, said the panelists in a
conference on women in prison
Saturday.
Improving the conditions for
women in prison, agreed the
panelists, are always considered as
an afterthought. Only concerted
community action can bring
about effective substantive
changes, they said.
The panelists were all involved
with Elmwood Correctional
Institute in Milpitas, the only
women's facility in Santa Clara
County, a maximum security
prison for sentenced and

unsentenced women charged with
felonies or misdemeanors.
Although drug-related crimes
are the most common causes of
arrest, there are no drug
detoxification or rehabilitation
programs at Elmwood, panelists
reported. Leslie Nassan, an
ex-inmate, said prisoners also
"need education to understand
why they are there in the first
place."
Dr. June Fisher, the only
woman on the six-doctor
committee investigating medical
conditions in the jails, said the full
horror of the situation could only
be comprehended by visiting the
jail.
Prisoners who are mothers, as
are 90 percent of Elmwood's
inmates, suffer additional
restrictions, said Fisher. Some
have not seen their children for 18
months; only one visit every six
months is permitted. Some
women have borne children while
they were incarcerated only to
have them immediately taken
away.

Women are also denied the
contact visiting privileges, wprk
furloughs, and other rights which
male prisoners have, said
Elizabeth Cobey, an attorney.
It is very difficult, said Cobey,
for women to be released on their
own recognizance, although it is
not for men.
The Felony Tank at Elmwood,
for women who cannot afford
bail, is not only inhumane,
charged Cobey, but also illegal.
Women live in tiny, windowless
cells with bolted-down furniture,
and are denied mail and phone
calls for as long as nine or 10
months, she said.
Cari Beauchamp, a legal
investigator, said the class action
suit on the inhumane conditions
in the Santa Clara jails, has been
in the courts for three years. A
few changes have been made as a
result, such as the provision of
24-hour nursing care.

felonies or misdemeanors.
Although drug-related crimes
are the most common causes of
arrest, there are no drug
detoxification or rehabilitation
programs at Elmwood, panelists
reported. Leslie Nassan, an
ex-inmate, said prisoners also
"need education to understand
why they are there in the first
place."
Dr. June Fisher, the only
woman on the six-doctor
committee investigating medical
conditions in the jails, said the full
horror of the situation could only
be comprehended by visiting the
jail.
Prisoners who are mothers, as
are 90 percent of Elmwood's
inmates, suffer additional
restrictions, said Fisher. Some
have not seen their children for 18
months; only one visit every six
months is permitted. Some
women have borne children while
they were incarcerated only to
have them immediately taken
away.

Women are also denied the
contact visiting privileges, wprk
furloughs, and other rights which
male prisoners have, said
Elizabeth Cobey, an attorney.
It is very difficult, said Cobey,
for women to be released on their
own recognizance, although it is
not for men.
The Felony Tank at Elmwood,
for women who cannot afford
bail, is not only inhumane,
charged Cobey, but also illegal.
Women live in tiny, windowless
cells with bolted-down furniture,
and are denied mail and phone
calls for as long as nine or 10
months, she said.
Cari Beauchamp, a legal
investigator, said the class action
suit on the inhumane conditions
in the Santa Clara jails, has been
in the courts for three years. A
few changes have been made as a
result, such as the provision of
24-hour nursing care.

Last week's International
Women's Day Fair brought both
elation and some disappointment
to its organizers.
"I think it was a great success,"
said Cary Ridder, a coordinator
for the fair's five days of
activities. ASSU Vice President
Beth Garfield agreed.
But both women expressed
disappointment that more
Stanford undergraduate women
had not participated. "I think
Stanford women still think
they're going to make it," Ridder
speculated. "It's not until you've
been out in the world for a while
that you see what you're really up
against."
The fair's varied events
included speeches by such
nationally prominent figures as
Kate Millett and Herbert Marc use,
as well as other speeches,
workshops and discussions with
individuals in a wide range of
professions and life situations.
Speeches
In a speech Thursday night, Jill
Johnston, author of Lesbian
Nation, said all women are both
mothers and daughters. Today's
lesbian movement, she said, is the
first collective effort to take the
part of the daughter.
Johnston said she no longer
discusses the women's movement
with men. "The only political
tactic I find viable is for women
to commit themselves to other
women," she said.
Mary Daly, associate professor
of theology at Boston College,
said in her Friday speech that
America is "a rapist society.
Women, she insisted, can only
survive by bonding together.
"The women's revolution is a
covenant, an agreement based on
a promise in ourselves," she said.
"It is a 'sisterhood of man,' a
non-rapist relationship to our
self."
Panels
In two panels on psychology,
"Women in Psychotherapy" and
"Dimensions in Transpersonal
Psychology," panelists spoke of
the failure of traditional therapy
in treating women. Therapy
groups, functioning as both
political and therapeutic tools,
have been one reaction to this
failure.
In Saturday's "Working
Women's Roundtable Discussion,"
panelists, all union members,
distinguished between the goals of
working women and those of
what one panelist called the
largely middle-class,
professionally-oriented women's
liberation movement.
But the women's movement
has affected working women, the
panelists agreed. Nellie Ward,
describing the six-month-old Sears
strike, said, "Seventy-five percent
of the strikers are women. A
couple of years ago I don't think
they would have stuck it out."
Members of the feminist law
firm of Davis, Dunlap & Williams
urged women to seek remedies to
discrimination through the courts
in the "Women's Rights in the
Courts" conference. They
cautioned women against thinking
of others before considering their
own rights. "Being nice is such a
detrimental thing," said Nancy
Davis, a partner in the San
Francisco firm.
University Women
The closed world of
professional cliques, poor
counseling, the implicit bias of
male interviewers seeking "their
own kind" and unliberated friends

were named as agents of
discrimination at the panel
discussion "Women in the
University: Is There
Discrimination?"
Diane Fields, second year law
student and former ASSU
co-president, suggested that
friends who have accepted
stereotypes discourage minority
women seeking to break out of
them.
Provost William Miller pointed
out that men also faced social
pressure from friends, but
suggested better counseling at the
university would lead to more
women in the professions.
Ann Miner, Stanford
affirmative action officer, listed
three main types of discrimination
she believes hold back qualified
women. She said "institutional
non-policy" permits the informal
exclusion of females because there
is no explicit hiring policy.
Discrimination also occurs when
job opportunities are known only
to a closed group of professionals
who perceive the hiree as a
"bright young man." Other
discriminatory practices denying
jobs to women stem directly from
stereotypes, she said.
Breaking Into Polities
"The first thing you have to
understand about women in
politics is that women are not in
politics," Miriam Goodman,
founder of the San Francisco
chapter of the Women's National
Political Caucus, told the audience
at a panel on "Women and the
Political Process."
This fact was reiterated by her
fellow panelists on Wednesday
and in separate talks by two
female political candidates on
Friday. The office seekers and
panelists focused on two main
issues which they said could help
women break the power barrier:
internal party reform, and
campaign financing and spending
restrictions.
Female political hopefuls must
overcome such obstacles as lack of
money, lack of political acumen,
the attitude of the press, their
own conditioning, and the fact
that they must often run against
incumbents. This list was
corroborated by Cathy O'Neill,
candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Secretary of State
in California, Suzanne Paizis, who
ran for state Senate in 1972, and
Maya Miller, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senator from Nevada.
Miller said, "Money goes where
backers think success is. They do
not advance money on idealism."
According to O'Neill, "Money
is the single most important factor

in state elections. Incumbents
raise 300 percent more money
than the challenger, and 98
percent of the incumbents are
men," She, like most of the
speakers, advocated public
financing and spending limits for
campaigns, which would aid
low-budget candidates such as
women.
Another difficulty facing
women office seekers is the press,
the speakers said. When O'Neill,
who sits on a state commission, a
Los Angeles city commission, the
Board of Directors of the state
Democratic Party, and teaches at
USC, announced her candidacy,
one paper headlined,
"Homemaker Seeks State Post."
"The news media often ask
questions of women candidates
they would never ask men,"
O'Neill said, "such as 'What will
happen to your children if you are
elected?' "
In order to overcome such
public scepticism, Paizis asserted,
"women have to be twice as good.
They have to have the statistics,
the data, do their homework."
It is precisely this kind of
doing "their homework" that has
given women what little political
leverage they have so far,
according to Miller. Nearly 40
percent of the delegates at the
1972 Democratic National
Convention were women because,
"We actually read the rules. The
very fact that we knew what was
in those rules constituted the
power to put them into effect,"
she said.
Marian Ash, Sacramento
lobbyist and editor of Skirting the
Capitol, a newsletter about
legislation relating to women,
insisted women do have influence
with male politicians. She said 50
male legislators had contacted her
to help draft a women's bill for
them to propose. Paizis added,
"Just the fact that women run
against them has made these men
believers."
Panel participants agreed that
social conditioning made women
shy away from the "dirty
business" of partisan politics.
"Qualities of leadership are male
qualities. That does mean women
have to change," said Goodman.
However, panelists added, an
injection of women into
government would probably
change politics as much as it
would change women. "We have
the potential for absolutely
tremendous political power,"
Paizis said, "And what that power
can do is make this country a
better place to live."
Lesbian Life
"We have found a more

comfortable home in the women's
movement than in the gay
movement," said Del Martin
during a Saturday night discussion
of "The Realities of
Homosexuality." Martin and
Phyllis Lyon, co-authors of
Lesbian Woman, were part of a
six-person discussion panel.
"There is a split between gay
men and gay women, just as
between straight men and straight
women," said Lyon. "As lesbians,
we also have the problem of being
discriminated against as women."
"What our liberation
movements are trying to do is say
that we're diverse people," added
Lyon. Each person has something
to contribute to society, and the
diversity only enriches human
potential, the panelists said.
This theme was also
emphasized by Dr. Don Clark, a
clinical psychologist specializing
in counseling gay men. "Gay is an
ability, not a disability. It is
something you can do, not
something you can't do," he said.
In a society which he said

values conformity more than
individuality, "the love possible
between women and the love
possible between men is
dangerous to the power
structure ... It leaves us
vulnerable to a world of
co-operation and peace."
Women As Prisoners
The oppressive injustices
women suffer in prison are merely
a magnification of the injustices
women in society are made to
bear, said the panelists in a
conference on women in prison
Saturday.
Improving the conditions for
women in prison, agreed the
panelists, are always considered as
an afterthought. Only concerted
community action can bring
about effective substantive
changes, they said.
The panelists were all involved
with Elmwood Correctional
Institute in Milpitas, the only
women's facility in Santa Clara
County, a maximum security
prison for sentenced and

unsentenced women charged with
felonies or misdemeanors.
Although drug-related crimes
are the most common causes of
arrest, there are no drug
detoxification or rehabilitation
programs at Elmwood, panelists
reported. Leslie Nassan, an
ex-inmate, said prisoners also
"need education to understand
why they are there in the first

better place to live."
Lesbian Life
"We have found a more

comfortable home in the women's
movement than in the gay
movement," said Del Martin
during a Saturday night discussion
of "The Realities of
Homosexuality." Martin and
Phyllis Lyon, co-authors of
Lesbian Woman, were part of a
six-person discussion panel.
"There is a split between gay
men and gay women, just as
between straight men and straight
women," said Lyon. "As lesbians,
we also have the problem of being
discriminated against as women."
"What our liberation
movements are trying to do is say
that we're diverse people," added
Lyon. Each person has something
to contribute to society, and the
diversity only enriches human
potential, the panelists said.
This theme was also
emphasized by Dr. Don Clark, a
clinical psychologist specializing
in counseling gay men. "Gay is an
ability, not a disability. It is
something you can do, not
something you can't do," he said.
In a society which he said

values conformity more than
individuality, "the love possible
between women and the love
possible between men is
dangerous to the power
structure ... It leaves us
vulnerable to a world of
co-operation and peace."
Women As Prisoners
The oppressive injustices
women suffer in prison are merely
a magnification of the injustices
women in society are made to
bear, said the panelists in a
conference on women in prison
Saturday.
Improving the conditions for
women in prison, agreed the
panelists, are always considered as
an afterthought. Only concerted
community action can bring
about effective substantive
changes, they said.
The panelists were all involved
with Elmwood Correctional
Institute in Milpitas, the only
women's facility in Santa Clara
County, a maximum security
prison for sentenced and

unsentenced women charged with
felonies or misdemeanors.
Although drug-related crimes
are the most common causes of
arrest, there are no drug
detoxification or rehabilitation
programs at Elmwood, panelists
reported. Leslie Nassan, an
ex-inmate, said prisoners also
"need education to understand
why they are there in the first
place."
Dr. June Fisher, the only
woman on the six-doctor
committee investigating medical
conditions in the jails, said the full
horror of the situation could only
be comprehended by visiting the
jail.
Prisoners who are mothers, as
are 90 percent of Elmwood's
inmates, suffer additional
restrictions, said Fisher. Some
have not seen their children for 18
months; only one visit every six
months is permitted. Some
women have borne children while
they were incarcerated only to
have them immediately taken
away.

Women are also denied the
contact visiting privileges, wprk
furloughs, and other rights which
male prisoners have, said
Elizabeth Cobey, an attorney.
It is very difficult, said Cobey,
for women to be released on their
own recognizance, although it is
not for men.
The Felony Tank at Elmwood,
for women who cannot afford
bail, is not only inhumane,
charged Cobey, but also illegal.
Women live in tiny, windowless
cells with bolted-down furniture,
and are denied mail and phone
calls for as long as nine or 10
months, she said.
Cari Beauchamp, a legal
investigator, said the class action
suit on the inhumane conditions
in the Santa Clara jails, has been
in the courts for three years. A
few changes have been made as a
result, such as the provision of
24-hour nursing care.

Last week's International
Women's Day Fair brought both
elation and some disappointment
to its organizers.
"I think it was a great success,"
said Cary Ridder, a coordinator
for the fair's five days of
activities. ASSU Vice President
Beth Garfield agreed.
But both women expressed
disappointment that more
Stanford undergraduate women
had not participated. "I think
Stanford women still think
they're going to make it," Ridder
speculated. "It's not until you've
been out in the world for a while
that you see what you're really up
against."
The fair's varied events
included speeches by such
nationally prominent figures as
Kate Millett and Herbert Marc use,
as well as other speeches,
workshops and discussions with
individuals in a wide range of
professions and life situations.
Speeches
In a speech Thursday night, Jill
Johnston, author of Lesbian
Nation, said all women are both
mothers and daughters. Today's
lesbian movement, she said, is the
first collective effort to take the
part of the daughter.
Johnston said she no longer
discusses the women's movement
with men. "The only political
tactic I find viable is for women
to commit themselves to other
women," she said.
Mary Daly, associate professor
of theology at Boston College,
said in her Friday speech that
America is "a rapist society.
Women, she insisted, can only
survive by bonding together.
"The women's revolution is a
covenant, an agreement based on
a promise in ourselves," she said.
"It is a 'sisterhood of man,' a
non-rapist relationship to our
self."
Panels
In two panels on psychology,
"Women in Psychotherapy" and
"Dimensions in Transpersonal
Psychology," panelists spoke of
the failure of traditional therapy
in treating women. Therapy
groups, functioning as both
political and therapeutic tools,
have been one reaction to this
failure.
In Saturday's "Working
Women's Roundtable Discussion,"
panelists, all union members,
distinguished between the goals of
working women and those of
what one panelist called the
largely middle-class,
professionally-oriented women's
liberation movement.
But the women's movement
has affected working women, the
panelists agreed. Nellie Ward,
describing the six-month-old Sears
strike, said, "Seventy-five percent
of the strikers are women. A
couple of years ago I don't think
they would have stuck it out."
Members of the feminist law
firm of Davis, Dunlap & Williams
urged women to seek remedies to
discrimination through the courts
in the "Women's Rights in the
Courts" conference. They
cautioned women against thinking
of others before considering their
own rights. "Being nice is such a
detrimental thing," said Nancy
Davis, a partner in the San
Francisco firm.
University Women
The closed world of
professional cliques, poor
counseling, the implicit bias of
male interviewers seeking "their
own kind" and unliberated friends

were named as agents of
discrimination at the panel
discussion "Women in the
University: Is There
Discrimination?"
Diane Fields, second year law
student and former ASSU
co-president, suggested that
friends who have accepted
stereotypes discourage minority
women seeking to break out of
them.
Provost William Miller pointed
out that men also faced social
pressure from friends, but
suggested better counseling at the
university would lead to more
women in the professions.
Ann Miner, Stanford
affirmative action officer, listed
three main types of discrimination
she believes hold back qualified
women. She said "institutional
non-policy" permits the informal
exclusion of females because there
is no explicit hiring policy.
Discrimination also occurs when
job opportunities are known only
to a closed group of professionals
who perceive the hiree as a
"bright young man." Other
discriminatory practices denying
jobs to women stem directly from
stereotypes, she said.
Breaking Into Polities
"The first thing you have to
understand about women in
politics is that women are not in
politics," Miriam Goodman,
founder of the San Francisco
chapter of the Women's National
Political Caucus, told the audience
at a panel on "Women and the
Political Process."
This fact was reiterated by her
fellow panelists on Wednesday
and in separate talks by two
female political candidates on
Friday. The office seekers and
panelists focused on two main
issues which they said could help
women break the power barrier:
internal party reform, and
campaign financing and spending
restrictions.
Female political hopefuls must
overcome such obstacles as lack of
money, lack of political acumen,
the attitude of the press, their
own conditioning, and the fact
that they must often run against
incumbents. This list was
corroborated by Cathy O'Neill,
candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Secretary of State
in California, Suzanne Paizis, who
ran for state Senate in 1972, and
Maya Miller, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senator from Nevada.
Miller said, "Money goes where
backers think success is. They do
not advance money on idealism."
According to O'Neill, "Money
is the single most important factor

in state elections. Incumbents
raise 300 percent more money
than the challenger, and 98
percent of the incumbents are
men," She, like most of the
speakers, advocated public
financing and spending limits for
campaigns, which would aid
low-budget candidates such as
women.
Another difficulty facing
women office seekers is the press,
the speakers said. When O'Neill,
who sits on a state commission, a
Los Angeles city commission, the
Board of Directors of the state
Democratic Party, and teaches at
USC, announced her candidacy,
one paper headlined,
"Homemaker Seeks State Post."
"The news media often ask
questions of women candidates
they would never ask men,"
O'Neill said, "such as 'What will
happen to your children if you are
elected?' "
In order to overcome such
public scepticism, Paizis asserted,
"women have to be twice as good.
They have to have the statistics,
the data, do their homework."
It is precisely this kind of
doing "their homework" that has
given women what little political
leverage they have so far,
according to Miller. Nearly 40
percent of the delegates at the
1972 Democratic National
Convention were women because,
"We actually read the rules. The
very fact that we knew what was
in those rules constituted the
power to put them into effect,"
she said.
Marian Ash, Sacramento
lobbyist and editor of Skirting the
Capitol, a newsletter about
legislation relating to women,
insisted women do have influence
with male politicians. She said 50
male legislators had contacted her
to help draft a women's bill for
them to propose. Paizis added,
"Just the fact that women run
against them has made these men
believers."
Panel participants agreed that
social conditioning made women
shy away from the "dirty
business" of partisan politics.
"Qualities of leadership are male
qualities. That does mean women
have to change," said Goodman.
However, panelists added, an
injection of women into
government would probably
change politics as much as it
would change women. "We have
the potential for absolutely
tremendous political power,"
Paizis said, "And what that power
can do is make this country a
better place to live."
Lesbian Life
"We have found a more

comfortable home in the women's
movement than in the gay
movement," said Del Martin

who sits on a state commission, a
Los Angeles city commission, the
Board of Directors of the state
Democratic Party, and teaches at
USC, announced her candidacy,
one paper headlined,
"Homemaker Seeks State Post."
"The news media often ask
questions of women candidates
they would never ask men,"
O'Neill said, "such as 'What will
happen to your children if you are
elected?' "
In order to overcome such
public scepticism, Paizis asserted,
"women have to be twice as good.
They have to have the statistics,
the data, do their homework."
It is precisely this kind of
doing "their homework" that has
given women what little political
leverage they have so far,
according to Miller. Nearly 40
percent of the delegates at the
1972 Democratic National
Convention were women because,
"We actually read the rules. The
very fact that we knew what was
in those rules constituted the
power to put them into effect,"
she said.
Marian Ash, Sacramento
lobbyist and editor of Skirting the
Capitol, a newsletter about
legislation relating to women,
insisted women do have influence
with male politicians. She said 50
male legislators had contacted her
to help draft a women's bill for
them to propose. Paizis added,
"Just the fact that women run
against them has made these men
believers."
Panel participants agreed that
social conditioning made women
shy away from the "dirty
business" of partisan politics.
"Qualities of leadership are male
qualities. That does mean women
have to change," said Goodman.
However, panelists added, an
injection of women into
government would probably
change politics as much as it
would change women. "We have
the potential for absolutely
tremendous political power,"
Paizis said, "And what that power
can do is make this country a
better place to live."
Lesbian Life
"We have found a more

comfortable home in the women's
movement than in the gay
movement," said Del Martin
during a Saturday night discussion
of "The Realities of
Homosexuality." Martin and
Phyllis Lyon, co-authors of
Lesbian Woman, were part of a
six-person discussion panel.
"There is a split between gay
men and gay women, just as
between straight men and straight
women," said Lyon. "As lesbians,
we also have the problem of being
discriminated against as women."
"What our liberation
movements are trying to do is say
that we're diverse people," added
Lyon. Each person has something
to contribute to society, and the
diversity only enriches human
potential, the panelists said.
This theme was also
emphasized by Dr. Don Clark, a
clinical psychologist specializing
in counseling gay men. "Gay is an
ability, not a disability. It is
something you can do, not
something you can't do," he said.
In a society which he said

values conformity more than
individuality, "the love possible
between women and the love
possible between men is
dangerous to the power
structure ... It leaves us
vulnerable to a world of
co-operation and peace."
Women As Prisoners
The oppressive injustices
women suffer in prison are merely
a magnification of the injustices
women in society are made to
bear, said the panelists in a
conference on women in prison
Saturday.
Improving the conditions for
women in prison, agreed the
panelists, are always considered as
an afterthought. Only concerted
community action can bring
about effective substantive
changes, they said.
The panelists were all involved
with Elmwood Correctional
Institute in Milpitas, the only
women's facility in Santa Clara
County, a maximum security
prison for sentenced and

unsentenced women charged with
felonies or misdemeanors.
Although drug-related crimes
are the most common causes of
arrest, there are no drug
detoxification or rehabilitation
programs at Elmwood, panelists
reported. Leslie Nassan, an
ex-inmate, said prisoners also
"need education to understand
why they are there in the first
place."
Dr. June Fisher, the only
woman on the six-doctor
committee investigating medical
conditions in the jails, said the full
horror of the situation could only
be comprehended by visiting the
jail.
Prisoners who are mothers, as
are 90 percent of Elmwood's
inmates, suffer additional
restrictions, said Fisher. Some
have not seen their children for 18
months; only one visit every six
months is permitted. Some
women have borne children while
they were incarcerated only to
have them immediately taken
away.

Women are also denied the
contact visiting privileges, wprk
furloughs, and other rights which
male prisoners have, said
Elizabeth Cobey, an attorney.
It is very difficult, said Cobey,
for women to be released on their
own recognizance, although it is
not for men.
The Felony Tank at Elmwood,
for women who cannot afford
bail, is not only inhumane,
charged Cobey, but also illegal.
Women live in tiny, windowless
cells with bolted-down furniture,
and are denied mail and phone
calls for as long as nine or 10
months, she said.
Cari Beauchamp, a legal
investigator, said the class action
suit on the inhumane conditions
in the Santa Clara jails, has been
in the courts for three years. A
few changes have been made as a
result, such as the provision of
24-hour nursing care.

Last week's International
Women's Day Fair brought both
elation and some disappointment
to its organizers.
"I think it was a great success,"
said Cary Ridder, a coordinator
for the fair's five days of
activities. ASSU Vice President
Beth Garfield agreed.
But both women expressed
disappointment that more
Stanford undergraduate women
had not participated. "I think
Stanford women still think
they're going to make it," Ridder
speculated. "It's not until you've
been out in the world for a while
that you see what you're really up
against."
The fair's varied events
included speeches by such
nationally prominent figures as
Kate Millett and Herbert Marc use,
as well as other speeches,
workshops and discussions with
individuals in a wide range of
professions and life situations.
Speeches
In a speech Thursday night, Jill
Johnston, author of Lesbian
Nation, said all women are both
mothers and daughters. Today's
lesbian movement, she said, is the
first collective effort to take the
part of the daughter.
Johnston said she no longer
discusses the women's movement
with men. "The only political
tactic I find viable is for women
to commit themselves to other
women," she said.
Mary Daly, associate professor
of theology at Boston College,
said in her Friday speech that
America is "a rapist society.
Women, she insisted, can only
survive by bonding together.
"The women's revolution is a
covenant, an agreement based on
a promise in ourselves," she said.
"It is a 'sisterhood of man,' a
non-rapist relationship to our
self."
Panels
In two panels on psychology,
"Women in Psychotherapy" and
"Dimensions in Transpersonal
Psychology," panelists spoke of
the failure of traditional therapy
in treating women. Therapy
groups, functioning as both
political and therapeutic tools,
have been one reaction to this
failure.
In Saturday's "Working
Women's Roundtable Discussion,"
panelists, all union members,
distinguished between the goals of
working women and those of
what one panelist called the
largely middle-class,
professionally-oriented women's
liberation movement.
But the women's movement
has affected working women, the
panelists agreed. Nellie Ward,
describing the six-month-old Sears
strike, said, "Seventy-five percent
of the strikers are women. A
couple of years ago I don't think
they would have stuck it out."
Members of the feminist law
firm of Davis, Dunlap & Williams
urged women to seek remedies to
discrimination through the courts
in the "Women's Rights in the
Courts" conference. They
cautioned women against thinking
of others before considering their
own rights. "Being nice is such a
detrimental thing," said Nancy
Davis, a partner in the San
Francisco firm.
University Women
The closed world of
professional cliques, poor
counseling, the implicit bias of
male interviewers seeking "their
own kind" and unliberated friends

were named as agents of
discrimination at the panel
discussion "Women in the
University: Is There
Discrimination?"
Diane Fields, second year law
student and former ASSU
co-president, suggested that
friends who have accepted
stereotypes discourage minority
women seeking to break out of
them.
Provost William Miller pointed
out that men also faced social
pressure from friends, but
suggested better counseling at the
university would lead to more
women in the professions.
Ann Miner, Stanford
affirmative action officer, listed
three main types of discrimination
she believes hold back qualified
women. She said "institutional
non-policy" permits the informal
exclusion of females because there
is no explicit hiring policy.
Discrimination also occurs when
job opportunities are known only
to a closed group of professionals
who perceive the hiree as a
"bright young man." Other
discriminatory practices denying
jobs to women stem directly from
stereotypes, she said.
Breaking Into Polities
"The first thing you have to
understand about women in
politics is that women are not in
politics," Miriam Goodman,
founder of the San Francisco
chapter of the Women's National
Political Caucus, told the audience
at a panel on "Women and the
Political Process."
This fact was reiterated by her
fellow panelists on Wednesday
and in separate talks by two
female political candidates on
Friday. The office seekers and
panelists focused on two main
issues which they said could help
women break the power barrier:
internal party reform, and
campaign financing and spending
restrictions.
Female political hopefuls must
overcome such obstacles as lack of
money, lack of political acumen,
the attitude of the press, their
own conditioning, and the fact
that they must often run against
incumbents. This list was
corroborated by Cathy O'Neill,
candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Secretary of State
in California, Suzanne Paizis, who
ran for state Senate in 1972, and
Maya Miller, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senator from Nevada.
Miller said, "Money goes where
backers think success is. They do
not advance money on idealism."
According to O'Neill, "Money
is the single most important factor

in state elections. Incumbents
raise 300 percent more money
than the challenger, and 98
percent of the incumbents are
men," She, like most of the
speakers, advocated public
financing and spending limits for
campaigns, which would aid
low-budget candidates such as
women.
Another difficulty facing
women office seekers is the press,
the speakers said. When O'Neill,
who sits on a state commission, a
Los Angeles city commission, the
Board of Directors of the state
Democratic Party, and teaches at
USC, announced her candidacy,

job opportunities are known only
to a closed group of professionals
who perceive the hiree as a
"bright young man." Other
discriminatory practices denying
jobs to women stem directly from
stereotypes, she said.
Breaking Into Polities
"The first thing you have to
understand about women in
politics is that women are not in
politics," Miriam Goodman,
founder of the San Francisco
chapter of the Women's National
Political Caucus, told the audience
at a panel on "Women and the
Political Process."
This fact was reiterated by her
fellow panelists on Wednesday
and in separate talks by two
female political candidates on
Friday. The office seekers and
panelists focused on two main
issues which they said could help
women break the power barrier:
internal party reform, and
campaign financing and spending
restrictions.
Female political hopefuls must
overcome such obstacles as lack of
money, lack of political acumen,
the attitude of the press, their
own conditioning, and the fact
that they must often run against
incumbents. This list was
corroborated by Cathy O'Neill,
candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Secretary of State
in California, Suzanne Paizis, who
ran for state Senate in 1972, and
Maya Miller, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senator from Nevada.
Miller said, "Money goes where
backers think success is. They do
not advance money on idealism."
According to O'Neill, "Money
is the single most important factor

in state elections. Incumbents
raise 300 percent more money
than the challenger, and 98
percent of the incumbents are
men," She, like most of the
speakers, advocated public
financing and spending limits for
campaigns, which would aid
low-budget candidates such as
women.
Another difficulty facing
women office seekers is the press,
the speakers said. When O'Neill,
who sits on a state commission, a
Los Angeles city commission, the
Board of Directors of the state
Democratic Party, and teaches at
USC, announced her candidacy,
one paper headlined,
"Homemaker Seeks State Post."
"The news media often ask
questions of women candidates
they would never ask men,"
O'Neill said, "such as 'What will
happen to your children if you are
elected?' "
In order to overcome such
public scepticism, Paizis asserted,
"women have to be twice as good.
They have to have the statistics,
the data, do their homework."
It is precisely this kind of
doing "their homework" that has
given women what little political
leverage they have so far,
according to Miller. Nearly 40
percent of the delegates at the
1972 Democratic National
Convention were women because,
"We actually read the rules. The
very fact that we knew what was
in those rules constituted the
power to put them into effect,"
she said.
Marian Ash, Sacramento
lobbyist and editor of Skirting the
Capitol, a newsletter about
legislation relating to women,
insisted women do have influence
with male politicians. She said 50
male legislators had contacted her
to help draft a women's bill for
them to propose. Paizis added,
"Just the fact that women run
against them has made these men
believers."
Panel participants agreed that
social conditioning made women
shy away from the "dirty
business" of partisan politics.
"Qualities of leadership are male
qualities. That does mean women
have to change," said Goodman.
However, panelists added, an
injection of women into
government would probably
change politics as much as it
would change women. "We have
the potential for absolutely
tremendous political power,"
Paizis said, "And what that power
can do is make this country a
better place to live."
Lesbian Life
"We have found a more

comfortable home in the women's
movement than in the gay
movement," said Del Martin
during a Saturday night discussion
of "The Realities of
Homosexuality." Martin and
Phyllis Lyon, co-authors of
Lesbian Woman, were part of a
six-person discussion panel.
"There is a split between gay
men and gay women, just as
between straight men and straight
women," said Lyon. "As lesbians,
we also have the problem of being
discriminated against as women."
"What our liberation
movements are trying to do is say
that we're diverse people," added
Lyon. Each person has something
to contribute to society, and the
diversity only enriches human
potential, the panelists said.
This theme was also
emphasized by Dr. Don Clark, a
clinical psychologist specializing
in counseling gay men. "Gay is an
ability, not a disability. It is
something you can do, not
something you can't do," he said.
In a society which he said

values conformity more than
individuality, "the love possible
between women and the love
possible between men is
dangerous to the power
structure ... It leaves us
vulnerable to a world of
co-operation and peace."
Women As Prisoners
The oppressive injustices
women suffer in prison are merely
a magnification of the injustices
women in society are made to
bear, said the panelists in a
conference on women in prison
Saturday.
Improving the conditions for
women in prison, agreed the
panelists, are always considered as
an afterthought. Only concerted
community action can bring
about effective substantive
changes, they said.
The panelists were all involved
with Elmwood Correctional
Institute in Milpitas, the only
women's facility in Santa Clara
County, a maximum security
prison for sentenced and

unsentenced women charged with
felonies or misdemeanors.
Although drug-related crimes
are the most common causes of
arrest, there are no drug
detoxification or rehabilitation
programs at Elmwood, panelists
reported. Leslie Nassan, an
ex-inmate, said prisoners also
"need education to understand
why they are there in the first
place."
Dr. June Fisher, the only
woman on the six-doctor
committee investigating medical
conditions in the jails, said the full
horror of the situation could only
be comprehended by visiting the
jail.
Prisoners who are mothers, as
are 90 percent of Elmwood's
inmates, suffer additional
restrictions, said Fisher. Some
have not seen their children for 18
months; only one visit every six
months is permitted. Some
women have borne children while
they were incarcerated only to
have them immediately taken
away.

Women are also denied the
contact visiting privileges, wprk
furloughs, and other rights which
male prisoners have, said
Elizabeth Cobey, an attorney.
It is very difficult, said Cobey,
for women to be released on their
own recognizance, although it is
not for men.
The Felony Tank at Elmwood,
for women who cannot afford
bail, is not only inhumane,
charged Cobey, but also illegal.
Women live in tiny, windowless
cells with bolted-down furniture,
and are denied mail and phone
calls for as long as nine or 10
months, she said.
Cari Beauchamp, a legal
investigator, said the class action
suit on the inhumane conditions
in the Santa Clara jails, has been
in the courts for three years. A
few changes have been made as a
result, such as the provision of
24-hour nursing care.

Last week's International
Women's Day Fair brought both
elation and some disappointment
to its organizers.
"I think it was a great success,"
said Cary Ridder, a coordinator
for the fair's five days of
activities. ASSU Vice President
Beth Garfield agreed.
But both women expressed
disappointment that more
Stanford undergraduate women
had not participated. "I think
Stanford women still think
they're going to make it," Ridder
speculated. "It's not until you've
been out in the world for a while
that you see what you're really up
against."
The fair's varied events
included speeches by such
nationally prominent figures as
Kate Millett and Herbert Marc use,
as well as other speeches,
workshops and discussions with
individuals in a wide range of
professions and life situations.
Speeches
In a speech Thursday night, Jill
Johnston, author of Lesbian
Nation, said all women are both
mothers and daughters. Today's
lesbian movement, she said, is the
first collective effort to take the
part of the daughter.
Johnston said she no longer
discusses the women's movement
with men. "The only political
tactic I find viable is for women
to commit themselves to other
women," she said.
Mary Daly, associate professor
of theology at Boston College,
said in her Friday speech that
America is "a rapist society.
Women, she insisted, can only
survive by bonding together.
"The women's revolution is a
covenant, an agreement based on
a promise in ourselves," she said.
"It is a 'sisterhood of man,' a
non-rapist relationship to our
self."
Panels
In two panels on psychology,
"Women in Psychotherapy" and
"Dimensions in Transpersonal
Psychology," panelists spoke of
the failure of traditional therapy
in treating women. Therapy
groups, functioning as both
political and therapeutic tools,
have been one reaction to this
failure.
In Saturday's "Working
Women's Roundtable Discussion,"
panelists, all union members,
distinguished between the goals of
working women and those of
what one panelist called the
largely middle-class,
professionally-oriented women's
liberation movement.
But the women's movement
has affected working women, the
panelists agreed. Nellie Ward,
describing the six-month-old Sears
strike, said, "Seventy-five percent
of the strikers are women. A
couple of years ago I don't think
they would have stuck it out."
Members of the feminist law
firm of Davis, Dunlap & Williams
urged women to seek remedies to
discrimination through the courts
in the "Women's Rights in the
Courts" conference. They
cautioned women against thinking
of others before considering their
own rights. "Being nice is such a
detrimental thing," said Nancy
Davis, a partner in the San
Francisco firm.
University Women
The closed world of
professional cliques, poor
counseling, the implicit bias of
male interviewers seeking "their
own kind" and unliberated friends

were named as agents of
discrimination at the panel
discussion "Women in the
University: Is There
Discrimination?"
Diane Fields, second year law
student and former ASSU
co-president, suggested that
friends who have accepted
stereotypes discourage minority
women seeking to break out of
them.
Provost William Miller pointed
out that men also faced social
pressure from friends, but
suggested better counseling at the
university would lead to more
women in the professions.
Ann Miner, Stanford
affirmative action officer, listed
three main types of discrimination
she believes hold back qualified
women. She said "institutional
non-policy" permits the informal
exclusion of females because there
is no explicit hiring policy.
Discrimination also occurs when
job opportunities are known only
to a closed group of professionals
who perceive the hiree as a
"bright young man." Other
discriminatory practices denying
jobs to women stem directly from
stereotypes, she said.
