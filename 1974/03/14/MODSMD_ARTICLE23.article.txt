June Harvey Siena, 43, community leader and wife of James V.
Siena, legal adviser to President Richard W. Lyman, died in her sleep
at their campus home late Saturday.
She had been in ill health for some time with a respiratory disease.
She was widely known within the campus community for her work
for planned parenthood, fair housing and schools, and her supportive
personal counseling of individuals.
"She couldn't touch anything without great energy, commitment
and delight," one friend recalled. Through her interest, her family
became deeply involved in Gilbert & Sullivan productions by the
Stanford Savoyards last year.
Born Jan. 26, 1931, in Evanston, Illinois, she graduated from New
Trier Township High School in Winnetka, 111. She received her
bachelor of arts degree at Dennison University, Ohio, where she
majored in drama. She later taught school in Cleveland Heights. Her
educational interests continued at Stanford in her volunteer support
of Nixon School and Gunn High School, where her three children
were enrolled.
They are Katherine, 18; James, 16; and Margaret, 10. A brother,
Robert Harvey, of Reno, Nevada, also survives.
