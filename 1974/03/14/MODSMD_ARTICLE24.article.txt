# Despite Other Duties
## Craig's Priorities: Teaching, Teaching 
### J.R. SULLIVAN 
Among the many priorities
that command the attention of
Gordon A. Craig, chairman of the
History Department, two stand
out: teaching and teaching.
'The most important thing in
my mind is teaching
undergraduates," he says,"and
second to that is teaching
graduates. If that teaching
function were cut out of me, I'd
really be nothing; I would be
insensible of feeling and
enthusiasm."
The enthusiasm that Craig's
teaching generates has made him
one of the most popular
professors in the University. At
Princeton, where he taught for 20
years before coming West, he was
rated the most successful teacher
in student polls. Craig has received
the Dinkelspiel Award for
outstanding teaching here,
evidence that his success
continues.
"There's no doubt about it
that anyone who teaches is a bit
of a ham," he states. "He likes to
have a popular response."
His colleagues have an equally
high regard for him. "Prof. Craig
is innovative, he loves to teach,"
says Wayne Vucinich, professor of
Eastern European history. "He
both publishes and teaches in a
high quality manner."
Honorary Post
Craig, whose field is modern
Germany, is an authority of such
stature that since 1962 he has
been honorary professor of
modern European history at the
Free University of Berlin. Every
few years, he teaches there for six
months, and takes time to
research and write.
"He is at first intimidating,"
asserts a former student, "but you
have to get by that." Walter
Lohnes, chairman of German
Studies, says, "Once you
penetrate that exterior, he is a
very warm human being."
Craig answers a knock on his
office door with a
furniture-rattling "Come in!" The
room is large and newer-looking
than most offices in the history
corner. Hundreds of books line
the walls, making the office seem
like a private library.

Craig has made changes felt far
beyond history corner. He was
chairman of the International
Relations Committee in the late
1960s that turned into the IR
undergraduate studies program.
Lohnes of German Studies
considers him to be "a member of
the department. There would be
no German Studies as we know it
without Prof. Craig."
"I really think we're headed in
the direction of interdisciplinary
studies," says Craig. "In this age
you really do have to tear the
walls between departments down.
This compartimentalization makes
you very parochial. I would hope
that this whole tendency to
co-operate goes much further."
Never Parochial
Craig's life has never given him
the opportunity to be parochial.
Born in Glasgow, Scotland, 60
years ago, to a Scot printer, he
was brought to Canada when he
was six months old. His family
later moved to Jersey City, and at
the height of the Depression in
1932, Craig came to Princeton for
the first time.
"1 always thought when I was
going to Princeton that I was
going to be a lawyer," says Craig.
He headed a debate society, and
the issues were always domestic
politics. But the influence of
several history teachers, especially
Raymond Sontag in European
history, caused Craig to consider
becoming an historian.
When he received a Rhodes
scholarship, the matter was
decided. Since he couldn't study
American law at Oxford, he
committed himself to history.
"Once I made up my mind to be
an historian, I was oriented to
German history from the start."
Germany became much more
immediate to Craig when he went
to Oxford. "The image of the
Hitler threat was very remote
until '36, really." The gloom that
settled on Europe after the Nazis
marched into the Rhineland "had
the curious effect of making life
at Oxford very gay and rather
frantic, in the best sense of the
word."
Craig came back to Princeton
that Fall to obtain his masters. He
was engaged at the time to Phyllis

Halcomb, but the small print in
the fellowship he was awarded
"said I couldn't get married." So
the marriage took place the next
year, when he was teaching at
Yale.
Back At Princeton
In 1941, Craig found himself
back at Princeton, having taken
the place of Sontag, who had left
for Berkeley. When the war broke
out, he joined the Marine Reserves
and went to work in Washington
in the office of Coordinator of
Information (which later became
the Office of Strategic Services).
He was put in the Mediterranean
Section, where his boss was also a
Princeton professor.
"When I got out of the war, I
said no one should ever be
allowed to teach social science in
the university if he hadn't had
some government experience, and
that he really should keep some
contact with government."
Although he doesn't believe that

should be the rule now, he follows
his own dictum by serving on
government boards such as the
Advisory Board on Social Science
of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.
Still, Craig's major concern is
teaching and innovation in
cirriculum. A History Department
legend holds that last year, during
one of Craig's colloquia, his
secretary opened the door and
entered the room. Craig looked up
with a harsh expression on his
face. "There's a long-distance
phone call for you," the secretary
said.
"Well, don't you know that
when I'm in the middle of a class
you're supposed to take a
message?" Craig demanded. "Tell
the person I'll call him back."
"It's Dr. Kissinger," replied the
awed secretary.
Without blinking an eye, Craig
responded, "Well, tell him I'll call
him back."

FIRST THINGS FIRST — Although chairman of the History
Department, Gordon Craig is careful not to neglect his teaching. Ask
the History Department secretaries — or perhaps Henry Kissinger.
