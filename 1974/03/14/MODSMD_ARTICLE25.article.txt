# Thai Official Wants 'Zone Of Peace'

On a long-term basis Thailand
would like to see Southeast Asia
become a "zone of peace and
neutrality," with the total
withdrawal of all foreign military'
forces from the region, Thai
Ambassador to the U.S. Anand
Panyarchun said here Tuesday.
But in the short run the U.S.
"could stage another coup" via
the CIA, one of Thailand's leading
social critics, Sulak Sivaraksa, told
an audience of 150 at a Tresidder

Memorial Union panel session.
Sulak "perhaps exaggerated the
effectiveness of the CIA," the
ambassador replied a few minutes
later in a friendly exchange. "In
any case it's up to the government
to see that the CIA presence is not
used to jeopardize national
integrity or the survival of a
civilian government."
With several other panelists,
the ambassador predicted a
"lessening of military
cooperation" with the U.S. and

greater emphasis on economic and
social programs.
While Thailand is currently
exploring trade relations with
China, he emphasized that "we
want to be masters of our own
destiny. We want to make sure
that the future of our economy is
not left in the hands of the
Chinese, as in the past, or in the
hands of the Japanese, Taiwanese
or Americans in the future."
While American foreign policy
reflected the influence of John

Foster Dulles for "too many
years," Thailand remains
"reluctant and apprehensive"
about China and has not
established formal diplomatic
relations with Peking, he noted.
"We're exploring deeper contacts
in our own way," perhaps starting
with "people-to-people" relations.
There's "no doubt" Thailand
wants to maintain its "deep, firm"
friendship with America, the
ambassador added.
Sulak, in good humor,
observed that "what [the
ambassador] really meant was
that he didn't know what policy
was going to be" until a new
government is elected. Until then,
foreign policy will be "nice and
vague" or what Americans might
call "mystical," he added
whimsically.
Because Thailand was
accustomed to strong, centralized
leadership "we want to have a
man on a white horse to lead the
country," he observed. Instead,
"we ought to unite ourselves,
preserve our freedom. ... explain
to [government] technocrats they
must be patient and tell students
that freedom can only be enjoyed
with security," not turmoil.
Following last October's
revolution, which was sparked by
student protests, Thailand has had
a caretaker government with "the
ex-head of the Buddhist
Association running the country.
He couldn't even run the Buddhist
Associationâ€”but he's a very nice
man," Sulak said warmly.
The ambassador noted that
"self-criticism is a virtue" and that
a few years ago Sulak probably
would not have been allowed to
leave Thailand.
Ob Vasurat, president of the
Thai Businessman's Association,
predicted that his country would
"enter in trade initiatives with
China not too far in the future,"
expecially since it could realize
savings of 25-30% on certain
imported goods. At the same time
Thailand wants to keep its trade
with China in balance, he said.
