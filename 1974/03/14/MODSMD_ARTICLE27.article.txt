# Wallace Sterling—Giant Of Two Stanford Decades
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Wallace Sterling is a giant — a giant who
leaves his office in Meyer Library at noon
each day unnoticed by the students he passes
on the way to his car parked in a nearby lot.
Few students would even recognize his name
if he stopped to introduce himself.
But during the 19 years in which Wallace
Sterling served as president of Stanford
University, he enjoyed the almost universal
devotion of Stanford's students, faculty and
staff. "Everybody from the receptionist to the
provost was really devoted to him," according
to Harvey Hall, who served as registrar under
Sterling.
Perhaps this was because the entire
community shared the sense of excitement
created by Sterling's dynamic and often risky
campaign to advance Stanford into the first
rank of American universities. A 1968 Daily
editorial pointed out that it was Sterling "who
made Stanford worth worrying about."
"He looked big, he thought big, he talked
big and he was big," says History Prof.
Emeritus Thomas A. Bailey, who has known
Sterling for about 40 years.
Sterling, who has been University
chancellor since his retirement from the
presidency on Sept. 1, 1968, continues to
have major responsibilies here as national
co-chairman of the Campaign for Stanford
and as a member of the Board of Trustees.
President Richard W. Lyman says that
Sterling remains "a very active fund raiser,"
encountering considerable success because of
his "great personal charm and experience. He
knows virtually everyone who has ever had
something to do with Stanford," Lyman adds.
Attracts Immense Donations
Sterling's personal ability to attract
immense donations for the University from
individuals, corporations and foundations was
"enormously responsible" for Stanford's
growth during his presidency, according to
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, his vice president
for finance.
Sterling himself says that as president "I
started from the proposition that the way to
improve the University is to get better
students and faculty." According to Sterling,
"one cannot attract an outstanding student
body or hire distinguished faculty without
money."
His ability to fund raise was enhanced by a
career which spanned many fields outside of
academia. Born John Ewart Wallace Sterling
on Aug. 6, 1906 in Linwood, Ontario, the
future Stanford president received his
undergraduate training at the University of
Toronto while playing intercollegiate football
and basketball.
Sterling earned a master's degree in history
at the University of Alberta, where he served
as director of physical education and as a
teaching assistant in history. In December
1930, shortly after his marriage to Anne Marie
Shaver, he enrolled here in pursuit of his
doctorate.
Hired By Hoover Institution
The Hoover Institution hired Sterling as a
research assistant in 1932 and he worked
there until 1937. From 1935 until 1937, he
also served as a history instructor.
Industrial Engineering Prof. Robert V.
Oakford, who was in Sterling's 1936 Western
Civilization section, recalls that "he was really
very excellent. My impression was that he
knew his subject very, very well. He didn't
just lecture to us," Oakford says,"he could
really lead a discussion, ask some questions
and get people to talk."
University Director of Government
Relations Robert E. Freelen, who took the
decision-making seminar which Sterling taught
for many years as president, says Sterling
"was a penetrating person in the classroom
who was very challenging in terms of focusing
questions."
Freelen adds that the president "had the
unique ability as a speaker and lecturer to
turn just the right phrase when he was trying
to make a point."
On Cal Tech Faculty
Sterling received his Ph.D. in January
1938, shortly after assuming an assistant
professorship in history at the California
Institute of Technology. Within seven years,
he held Cal Tech's Edward S. Harkness
Professorship in History and Government and
was chairman of the faculty.
Employed by the CBS Radio Network
from 1942 until 1948, Sterling "was a great
success at news analysis and commentary,"
Bailey says. Sterling covered the major
political parties' national conventions and the
formation of the ' United Nations in San
Francisco. Bailey says "this brought him a
good deal of favorable public attention."
The Henry E. Huntington Library and Art
Gallery in San Marino, Calif, hired Sterling as
its director in July 1948, only to lose him
when Stanford Board of Trustees President
Paul C. Edwards called upon him four months
later.

When the Board elected Sterling president
on Nov. 19, 1948, to succeed the late Donald
B. Tresidder, morale was low throughout the
University community.
'Stanford Family Unhappy'
"The Stanford family was an unhappy
family at the time Sterling came in," recalls
his provost, Frederick E. Terman. "There was
a lot of discontent among the faculty, the
alumni were unhappy and the students were
becoming disaffected."
Terman believes that Sterling "did a most
magnificent job in that first year or so of
settling things down. He must have sensed the
situation," Terman adds.
"It's hard to put your finger on what he
did, but everything he did was just right. The
institution relaxed and the atmospehre
changed," Terman says.
Academic Secretary H. Donald Winbigler,
who served as Sterling's dean of students, says
that the president's own personality was, in
large part, responsible for this relaxation of
tensions. "He was very gracious, very open,
very friendly, very much concrned about
getting acquainted with the faculty and the
students," Winbigler says.
'Completely Innocent'
Sterling himself recalls that when he
arrived here in April 1949, "I was completely
innocent. I had very little executive
experience, and I felt I had to know a lot
more about the University than I did before I
made any moves."
But at least one major University problem
could not wait until Sterling had gained that
knowledge. As Stanford's president, Sterling
was also chairman of the board of the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Soon after
his arrival, he discovered that SRI was $1.1
million in debt, owing about half that sum to
the University.
"I spent as much, if not more, time on SRI
matters than on University matters during the
summer of 1949," Sterling says. Within a year
after he became president, SRI was in the
black again. (The University severed all ties
with SRI in 1969 after widespread student
protests.)
"The other problem that emerged very
soon after I arrived," Sterling says, "was the
question of what to do with the Medical
School." At the time he took over, the
Medical School was located in antiquated
facilities in San Francisco.
'Sapping University's Lifeblood'
According to a Dec. 3, 1960 article in the
Saturday Evening Post, the school "was
sapping the university's lifeblood by
devouring one sixth of the total annual budget
to train just 240 out of Stanford's 8700
students. The situation was so bad that many
faculty members urged Sterling to abandon
the training of doctors."
Sterling, however, believed it was the
University's obligation to keep the Medical
School open. Asking the Board of Trustees to
move the Medical School onto the main
campus was "a major decision and a tough
one, battled by good men," according to
Frederic O. Glover, then assistant to the
president.
In addition to the bitter opposition of a
majority of the Medical School faculty,
Sterling was also faced with the seemingly
impossible task of raising $21 million for the
construction of the new school. Critics
promptly labeled the project "Wally's Folly."
The Board of Trustees approved the move
in June 1953 and Sterling spent nearly all of
the next year leading a drive to raise the
funds. Receiving a $3 million unrestricted
endowment from the Ford Foundation and
$4 million from federal agencies under the
Health Research Facilities Act of 1953, the
University also procured $6 million from
alumni and other foundations.
Palo Alto Contributions
The city of Palo Alto came up with $4
million to replace its old hospital with a new
wing in the Medical Center and Sterling's
gamble turned out to be a tremendous
success. "In retrospect," Sterling says,"I
think it was a wise move because it brought
the Medical School closer to the physical and
social sciences, with which it has interacted
for their mutual benefit."
When the new Medical Center opened in
1958, many of the old faculty resigned rather
than make the move from San Francisco. This
gave Sterling and Terman one of many
opportunities to upgrade the prestige of
Stanford's faculty.
Cuthbertson recalls that Sterling's offer of
a position at Stanford was the "kind of
invitation you couldn't turn down. Without in
any sense overselling the University or what
he was trying to do," Cuthbertson says,"he
made it seem so important that anyone asked
to become involved couldn't turn it down."
Winbigler agrees that "it was often a talk
with Sterling which convinced distinguished
professors from the East that Stanford was
where they should be."

Sterling's efforts to raise money for the
refurbishing of the Quad was another key
factor in the recruitment of faculty. "A lot of
people today would be shocked at the
condition of the physical plant which he
inherited in 1949," Winbigler says.
So many new buildings popped up during
Sterling's presidency that Glover refers to the
era as "Sterling's second stone age." Bailey
believes that "at no time during his entire
incumbency was there not a major building
under construction."
In addition to building new facilities to
attract prestigious professors, Sterling also
authorized a 60 percent increase in faculty
salaries during his first ten years on the job.
Finally, he armed Terman with "The Fighting
Fund," which the Saturday Evening Post
described as "an emergency war chest from
which Provost Terman (could] immediately
match bids of other institutions."
Stanford was now able to attract a larger,
brighter, more cosmopolitan student body
because, according to Hall, Sterling and
Terman "Went out and brought in
outstanding professors who could offer
instruction at all levels," rather than
concentrating solely upon graduate
instruction or research.
Undergraduate Review
Soon after he became president, Sterling
discovered that the University's undergraduate
curriculum "had never been reviewed as a
whole at one time." A faculty committee had
recently recommended sweeping changes in
the undergraduate program, but the full
faculty "turned down these recommendations
virtually out of hand."
Sterling says "this made it rather natural
that I should take notice of the matter. I also
had a direct and personal interest in this
becaue I loved the classroom and I loved to
teach."
Despite having "no way of knowing" how
the faculty would respond, Sterling launched
the Stanford Study of Undergraduate
Education in 1954. Hall calls the study "a
monumental revaluation of the University. It
was Sterling's idea and he got it funded from
the outside."
"I thought the way to proceed," Sterling
says, "was to get as much faculty
participation in the preliminary discussion as
possible," So, as the study's staff came up
with proposals they asked fellow faculty
members out to lunch and then "tested on
these people the ideas that were being put
forth in the study's committees."
Study's Recommendations
The study's staff issued its report in 1956,
recommending: a University-wide requirement
of one full year of freshman English; that each
student "be automatically freed from the
requirements within that area — the natural
sciences, the social sciences, or the humanities
— in which he majors"; and reduced unit
requirements in the other two areas.
Sterling recalls that when these proposals
came before the Academic Council, they were
passed "inside of an hour." He believes that
the widespread participation of the faculty in
the study made this easy approval possible.
Less than a year later, German Prof.
Friedrich W. Strothmann suggested to Sterling
a most unique innovation in undergraduate
education: an overseas study center in
Germany. Glover says that Strothmann "went
over to Germany with Sterling's blessing" to
search for a suitable site. He eventually settled
upon Beutelsbach, where the Stanford center
opened in the autumn of 1959.
The idea proved so successful that Stanford
opened centers in Florence, Italy; Tours,
France; Vienna, Austria and Cliveden,
England. Glover says it was Sterling "who
approved the idea and who played a major
role in persuading the European governments
to cooperate with us."
Sterling's Popularity Grows
Sterling's success in developing Stanford
academically corresponded with the growth of
his popularity among faculty and students
alike.
To honor Sterling on the 10th anniversary
of his assuming the presidency, the faculty set
out to raise $10,000 as a gift of appreciation
to him. Political Science Prof. James T.
Watkins IV and English Prof. John W. Dodds
actually collected $18,000 from their fellow
faculty members.
"I don't know of any other university
president in the history of American
education to whom this has happened,"
Bailey says. Although Sterling was free to use
the money for any purpose he chose, he
donated it to buy the books which formed the
basis of the collection at Meyer Library.
A Daily editorial published on Sterling's
10th anniversary here, said "President Sterling
has achieved something more — a special kind
of personal relationship with the Stanford
students. With all of the burden of

responsibility that is involved in the office of
President, Dr. Sterling still finds time to teach
a course, chat informally with this and that
group of students and give a friendly world of
advice to the student who wanders into his
office."
Hoover Institution Controversies
Despite his personal popularity, Sterling
soon encountered the most serious faculty
opposition of his presidency over the future
of the Hoover Institution and the
appointment of Dr. W. Glenn Campbell as its
new director.
When Dr. C. Easton Rothwell resigned as
director of the Hoover Institution in June
1959 to assume the presidency of Mills
College, Sterling appointed Philip H.
Rhinelander, then dean of humanities and
sciences, as acting director.
Rhinelander says that faculty members in
the School of Humanities and Sciences
formed "an informal search committee" with
Sterling's knowledge to consider candidates
for permanent director. Rhinelander says that
the committee regarded this as "an
opportunity for a really first-class
appointment."
Suddenly, On Nov. 19, 1959, Sterling
announced the appointment of Campbell,
then research director of the American
Enterprise Association, as new Hoover
director. Members of the ad hoc faculty
committee were stunned. "This really
bothered me," Rhinelander says."I felt that
as acting director I should at least have been
kept in touch with these things."
'Hoover Had Dictated It'
According to Rhinelander, Sterling had
earlier promised that "I won't appoint
anybody I don't approve of." Neverleless,
Rhinelander says that "Wally took the
position that Mr. Hoover [Institution founder
and former President Herbert Hoover] had
dictated Campbell's appointment and that he
couldn't resist it."
Rhinelander says that "there was a
brouhaha over the appointment. The fact that
so important a post should be dictated from
outside was something that a good many
people regretted," he explains.
"This had nothing to do with Campbell as
a person," Rhinelander emphasizes. Instead,
"this had to do with University
independence." Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier recalls that "Sterling was
embarrassed. I think it was one of the first
times that he felt beleagured," he adds.
At about the same time, the faculty
learned of a preamble written by Herbert
Hoover for the May 21, 1959 Board of
Trustees resolution redefining the relationship
between the University and the Institution.
Doctrines Of Marx
In part, the preamble read: "the purpose of
this Institution must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx—whether Communism,
Socialism, economic materialism, or
atheism—thus to protect the American way of
life from such ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the American
system."
Hall says that many faculty members "felt
the Hoover Institution shouldn't fight for or
against anything and should engage only in
research." Dealing with Hoover over this issue,
according to Hall, was one of Sterling's "most
difficult problems."
Drekmeier says that "at the time, the
faculty was particularly sensitive about the
symbolic power of the Hoover Institution,"
which was then a dominant factor in
enhancing the University's national
reputation.
Sterling shared many of the faculty's
misgivings and told the Academic Council on
April 1, 1960 that "the well established and
honored principle is that no research that is
bona fide and worthy of the name can be
undertaken with predetermined conclusions.
Sterling Shares Misgivings
"Certainly it is my judgment that it
cannot," Sterling added, "This judgment has
been vigorously enunciated both to the
Founder and to the new Director, as well as to
the Trustees."
He also emphasized that Hoover's preamble
"is, from the point of view of the Trustees,
simply a matter of record. It is not a formal
part of the Trustee resolution of 21 May
1959."
Despite his feeling that Sterling "was more
under Mr. Hoover's thumb in this matter than
most of us would have liked," Rhinelander
says most pressures upon the University from
the outside during this period were handled
well by the Sterling administration.
"As far as resisting McCarthyism went, I
don't think there is any evidence that
Stanford ever weakened," Rhinelander says.
Defends Academic Freedom
Glover calls Sterling "a very strong
defender of academic freedom." He says
"there were a number of instances where we
defended faculty members with Stanford
attorneys" against the "absolutely incredible
charges" made against them by the state
legislature's un-American activities committee.
Although some have charged that Sterling
and Glover were not sufficiently supportive of
controversial professors such as the late
Marxist economist, Paul Baran, the Academic
Council praised Sterling in 1968 because he
"vigorously championed the autonomy of the
university's values and fought repeatedly in
most difficult times for the preservation and
extension of academic freedom."
As president of the American Association
of Universities (AAU) from 1961 to 1963,
Sterling fashioned an AAU statement on
academic freedom which won national
acclaim.
While the Hoover Institution controversies
raged among the faculty, Sterling and
Cuthbertson discovered that Stanford would
have insufficient resources to meet its needs in
the 60s. Cuthbertson was the principal author
of the so-called "Red Book," which made
long-term .forecasts of the University's
minimum, moderate and maximum financial
needs.
Officials of the Ford Foundation visited
Stanford late in 1959 and inquired whether
the University's administration had planned
for its next 10 years. Sterling and Cuthbertson
showed the a "Red Book" and the Ford

officials were so favorably impressed that they
asked Stanford to design the format under
which other universities would request special
program funding from the foundation.
$25 Million Grant
In September 1960, Ford Foundation
President Henry T. Heald announced a total
of $46 million in matching special program
grants to five universities. Stanford received
$25 million over a five year period; the next
largest grant was $6 million.
Under the terms of the grant, Stanford had
to raise $75 million from private sources to
match Ford's $25 million.
Sterling says "what we had already done in
terms of self-help" played a considerable role
in securing so large an amount for Stanford.
The development under Sterling of significant
portions of the University's 8200 acres of land
holdings represented one of the most unusual
aspects of Stanford's "self-help" efforts.
Along with the SRI financial situation in
1949, the review of undergraduate education
and the Hoover Institution controversies.
Sterling says that the land development was
one of "four problems that were rather
conspicuous" during his presidency.
Industrial Park Established
Under Sterling, Stanford established the
nation's first science-based industrial park in
1951. Covering 481 acres of leased University
land, the Industrial Park now houses 75
companies or firms in nearly 100 facilities.
Four years after establishing the Industrial
Park, Stanford opened a shopping center
adjacent to the Medical School. The shopping
Center now serves 53 tenants on a total of 81
acres of leased land. Sterling says these
developments immediately "began to produce
income which was unrestricted as to use."
However, even before Stanford received
the incentive grant from the Ford
Foundation, Sterling realized that "we would
have to step up our fund-raising effort" to
supplement the income from land
development and federal grants and contracts.
On April 18, 1961, he announced the
three-year, $100 million Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era (PACE) drive with the Ford
grant as a base. "This campaign is our boldest
venture since the University was founded,"
Sterling said.
'An Historic Opportunity'
"This objective places Stanford in the grip
of an historic opportunity. . further to
enhance her growing strength and to scale new
peaks of excellence," Sterling said.
Oakford says that Sterling himself "did a
magnificent job of fund-raising" during the
PACE drive. Terman says of Sterling, "to the
public, he was the image of Stanford. He was
skillful in fund-raising which wasn't
high-pressure promotion. People just had a

way of doing things for Wally," Terman
recalls.
The successful completion of the PACE
drive in 1964 set a new record for private
support in capital campaigns of American
universities (sll4 million). Sterling says the
PACE drive allowed Stanford to meet the
"urgent needs whose solutions had been
postponed" throughout the Great Depression
and World War 11.
At the conclusion of the PACE drive, a
survey released by the American Council on
Education (ACE) revealed the results of
Sterling's work toward building the quality of
Stanford's faculty.
Improvement Over 1957
Terman, who was equally responsible for
this improvement, says that "in 1964,
Stanford showed more improvement than any
other university over the 1957 survey"
commissioned by the University of
Pennsylvania.
"We tended to move up all across the
board," Terman says, "in the sciences, in
medicine, in the humanities and in the social
sciences."
The 1964 ACE survey of more than 4000
department chairmen and professors ranked
Stanford as the third "best balanced
distinguished university in the country,"
behind UC Berkeley and Harvard. The 1957
survey had ranked Stanford 15th.
The most remarkable improvement in the
quality of Stanford's faculty was shown in
departments such as chemistry (ranked 15th
in 1957 and fifth in 1964) and English and
history (both ranked 15th in 1957 and
seventh in 1964).
Further Improvement
Terman says that Stanford showed further
improvement in a 1969 ACE survey.
Sterling has always insisted that his
fund-raising activities were designed "to
achieve an academic objective." He points out
that "if the idea you have is to enhance the
prestige of the University, you've got to
finance it."
Terman says the survey results proved that
"we were coming through on what Sterling

STANFORD'S GlANT—Wallace Sterling, who
has served as University chancellor since 1968,
previously held the presidency here for 19
years. He is now a member of the Board of
Trustees and national co-chairman of the
Campaign for Stanford.
