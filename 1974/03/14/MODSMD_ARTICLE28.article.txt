### 
Chemistry Prof. Eric Hutchinson will

Sept. 1, President Richard W. Lyman

for the Faculty Senate and Academic
Council.
Hutchinson will succeed H. Donald
Winbigler, who will retire Aug. 31 after 34
years service to the University, including
seven as Academic Secretary.
Religious Studies Prof. William Clebsch,
former Senate chairman who headed the
search committee, said Hutchinson has all the
personal qualifications needed in the job —
"love of the University, the wide

acquaintance and confidence of the faculty,
command of the English language and the
ability to be influential without being highly
visible."
Holder of three degrees from Cambridge
University, Hutchinson currently heads both
the Committee on Interdepartmental Majors
and the University Lecture Committee. Last
spring he served on the Faculty Senate
Steering Committee.
Through the years he has served on
committees concerned with Rhodes scholars,
the School of Humanities and Sciences,
external financial awards, undergraduate
housing, religious affairs, student services,
undergraduate education and the University
Press.
From 1964 until last year he directed the

Public Affairs Fellowship program, which
brings government employees to the
University for further study at mid-career. He
currently serves on the working group for
Values, Technology, and • Society, an
interdepartmental academic program.
Hutchinson is former editor of the Journal
of Colloid Science, and author of more than
35 professional papers and four books.
One of his popular classes is calligraphy,
offered through the Undergraduate Specials
Department. His most widely noticed works
include the University and School heraldic
banners regularly used at commencement and
other major ceremonies since 1967.
Hutchinson and Winbigler plan to work
together as much as possible between now
and September to provide a smooth
transition for the office.
