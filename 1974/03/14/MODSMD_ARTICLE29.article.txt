State Burglary Charges Dropped
LOS ANGELES — California burglary and conspiracy
charges against John D. Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy and
David R. Young Jr. in the Ellsberg burglary case were
dismissed yesterday in favor of allowing federal prosecution
of the case to proceed.
The order came after attorneys for Ehrlichman and
Liddy objected to the dismissal procedures.
Ehrlichman and Liddy were indicted last week under
similar charges in a federal court in Washington, D.C., and
those charges are not affected by yesterday's state-level
action.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer granted a motion
by the Los Angeles district attorney to allow the
indictment of Ehrlichman to stand for one charge of
perjury. The judge said he expected the perjury trial to
proceed quickly, perhaps in April.
At the request of Ehrlichman's attorney, Ringer vacated
a subpoena that had commanded President Nixon to appear
at a pretrial hearing and at the April 15 trial. Attorney
Douglas Dalton, representing Ehrlichman, reserved the right
to seek another such subpoena if Nixon's testimony is seen
as material to the perjury charge.
Attorneys for both Liddy and Ehrlichman contended
that the dismissal in Los Angeles was engineered to give an
advantage to the federal government in prosecuting the two
former White House employees.
Panel Seeks Impeachment Material
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee said yesterday everything it has requested from
the White House for its impeachment inquiry is relevant
and should be supplied.
Responding to White House criticism of the request,
Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., said the committee is prepared
to subpoena the evidence if the White House refuses to
supply it.
Rodino's hard stand in favor of the committee's right to
evidence for its impeachment inquiry was fully supported
by Rep. Edward Hutchinson, R-Mich., the committee's
ranking Republican.
"The requests made to date are very reasonable," said
Hutchinson at a joint news conference with Rodino. "The
White House should be totally cooperative with us."
The two leaders of the impeachment panel said it was
their hope a confrontation with the White House over the
furnishing of evidence could be avoided, but that the
constitutional authority the committee is operating under
leaves the White House no room to refuse its request.
Senate Passes Death Penalty Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to restore
the death penalty for espionage, treason and certain other
federal crimes such as kidnaping and airplane hijacking that
result in death.
The vote was 54 to 33.
The bill, modified somewhat by amendments, now goes
to the House, where no early action on it is in prospect.
Urged by President Nixon a year ago, the bill is designed
to overcome a 1972 Supreme Court decision that the death
penalty, as applied under existing laws, was
unconstitutional.
The bill lists a number of aggravating factors which
would make the death penalty mandatory.
However, if any mitigating factors existed, such as being
under 18 years of age or having significantly impaired
mental capacity, a death sentence would be barred.
Other mitigating factors set out in the bill are acting

under unusual or substantial duress, being a relatively minor
participant in a crime, and not having been reasonably able
to foresee that one's conduct would cause a risk of death to
another.
SF Employees Continue To Picket
SAN FRANCISCO — Striking city workers threw up
new picket lines yesterday as police held off on arrests
ordered by a judge. Union negotiators rejected a new city
wage offer.
About 380,000 commuters were left without public
transit. The unions halted the normal daily flow of 500
buses across San Francisco Bay because bus drivers refused
to cross picket lines at the downtown East Bay terminal on
the strike's seventh day.
City buses, trolleys and cable cars were shut down last
Friday by pickets who also closed sewage plants and the
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) subway in San Francisco.
Lt. William O'Connor said police were studying a cou«-t
injunction received Tuesday night by Chief Don Scott. It
directs police to arrest pickets at sewage plants, the public
transit system terminals and two public hospitals.
Prisoners Ask Judge For TV Time
HILLSBOROUGH — A judge took under advisement
yesterday a request to give two prisoners a nationally
televised appearance which they claim could help save the
life of kidnaped heiress Patricia Hearst.
Attorneys for Russell Little, 24, and Joseph Remiro, 27,
asked Sam Hall to permit their clients to make an
appearance on television for five to 10 minutes. They said it
would be in a courtroom with only one camera and one
reporter present.
The judge said he would make a decision on Monday.
Attorneys later said he seemed reluctant to comply with
their request.
Remiro and Little, charged in Alameda County with
murdering Oakland School Supt. Marcus Foster, also are
charged in Contra Costa County with attempted murder
stemming from a shootout with police on Jan. 10.
Judge Hall said his decision would be based on the
Contra Costa case alone.
Reinecke Drops From Public View
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke slipped out of
public sight again yesterday.
If anyone knew where he was, they weren't saying.
"We don't have that information," said a secretary who
works for Reinecke's press aide, Earl Parker.
"He isn't in the office," said a secretary in Reinecke's
own office in the Capitol.
The new "disappearance" of the Republican candidate
for governor was similar to one last month when Reinecke
made a secret trip to Washington in an effort to "clear my
name" in the ITT scandal.
Speculation that he might have gone back to Washington
in that pursuit could not be substantiated.
One source said Reinecke was seen in his Capitol office
during the morning, but Reinecke aides refused to discuss
his whereabouts.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair tonight but with patchy morning low clouds.
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow. Slightly warmer days.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the
60s. Light variable winds becoming mostly westerly 5 to 15
mph afternoons.

SAN FRANCISCO — Striking city workers threw up
new picket lines yesterday as police held off on arrests
ordered by a judge. Union negotiators rejected a new city
wage offer.
About 380,000 commuters were left without public
transit. The unions halted the normal daily flow of 500
buses across San Francisco Bay because bus drivers refused
to cross picket lines at the downtown East Bay terminal on
the strike's seventh day.
City buses, trolleys and cable cars were shut down last
Friday by pickets who also closed sewage plants and the
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) subway in San Francisco.
Lt. William O'Connor said police were studying a cou«-t
injunction received Tuesday night by Chief Don Scott. It
directs police to arrest pickets at sewage plants, the public
transit system terminals and two public hospitals.
Prisoners Ask Judge For TV Time
HILLSBOROUGH — A judge took under advisement
yesterday a request to give two prisoners a nationally
televised appearance which they claim could help save the
life of kidnaped heiress Patricia Hearst.
Attorneys for Russell Little, 24, and Joseph Remiro, 27,
asked Sam Hall to permit their clients to make an
appearance on television for five to 10 minutes. They said it
would be in a courtroom with only one camera and one
reporter present.
The judge said he would make a decision on Monday.
Attorneys later said he seemed reluctant to comply with
their request.
Remiro and Little, charged in Alameda County with
murdering Oakland School Supt. Marcus Foster, also are
charged in Contra Costa County with attempted murder
stemming from a shootout with police on Jan. 10.
Judge Hall said his decision would be based on the
Contra Costa case alone.
Reinecke Drops From Public View
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke slipped out of
public sight again yesterday.
If anyone knew where he was, they weren't saying.
"We don't have that information," said a secretary who
works for Reinecke's press aide, Earl Parker.
"He isn't in the office," said a secretary in Reinecke's
own office in the Capitol.
The new "disappearance" of the Republican candidate
for governor was similar to one last month when Reinecke
made a secret trip to Washington in an effort to "clear my
name" in the ITT scandal.
Speculation that he might have gone back to Washington
in that pursuit could not be substantiated.
One source said Reinecke was seen in his Capitol office
during the morning, but Reinecke aides refused to discuss
his whereabouts.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair tonight but with patchy morning low clouds.
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow. Slightly warmer days.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the
60s. Light variable winds becoming mostly westerly 5 to 15
mph afternoons.
State Burglary Charges Dropped
LOS ANGELES — California burglary and conspiracy
charges against John D. Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy and
David R. Young Jr. in the Ellsberg burglary case were
dismissed yesterday in favor of allowing federal prosecution
of the case to proceed.
The order came after attorneys for Ehrlichman and
Liddy objected to the dismissal procedures.
Ehrlichman and Liddy were indicted last week under
similar charges in a federal court in Washington, D.C., and
those charges are not affected by yesterday's state-level
action.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer granted a motion
by the Los Angeles district attorney to allow the
indictment of Ehrlichman to stand for one charge of
perjury. The judge said he expected the perjury trial to
proceed quickly, perhaps in April.
At the request of Ehrlichman's attorney, Ringer vacated
a subpoena that had commanded President Nixon to appear
at a pretrial hearing and at the April 15 trial. Attorney
Douglas Dalton, representing Ehrlichman, reserved the right
to seek another such subpoena if Nixon's testimony is seen
as material to the perjury charge.
Attorneys for both Liddy and Ehrlichman contended
that the dismissal in Los Angeles was engineered to give an
advantage to the federal government in prosecuting the two
former White House employees.
Panel Seeks Impeachment Material
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee said yesterday everything it has requested from
the White House for its impeachment inquiry is relevant
and should be supplied.
Responding to White House criticism of the request,
Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., said the committee is prepared
to subpoena the evidence if the White House refuses to
supply it.
Rodino's hard stand in favor of the committee's right to
evidence for its impeachment inquiry was fully supported
by Rep. Edward Hutchinson, R-Mich., the committee's
ranking Republican.
"The requests made to date are very reasonable," said
Hutchinson at a joint news conference with Rodino. "The
White House should be totally cooperative with us."
The two leaders of the impeachment panel said it was
their hope a confrontation with the White House over the
furnishing of evidence could be avoided, but that the
constitutional authority the committee is operating under
leaves the White House no room to refuse its request.
Senate Passes Death Penalty Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to restore
the death penalty for espionage, treason and certain other
federal crimes such as kidnaping and airplane hijacking that
result in death.
The vote was 54 to 33.
The bill, modified somewhat by amendments, now goes
to the House, where no early action on it is in prospect.
Urged by President Nixon a year ago, the bill is designed
to overcome a 1972 Supreme Court decision that the death
penalty, as applied under existing laws, was
unconstitutional.
The bill lists a number of aggravating factors which
would make the death penalty mandatory.
However, if any mitigating factors existed, such as being
under 18 years of age or having significantly impaired

State Burglary Charges Dropped
LOS ANGELES — California burglary and conspiracy
charges against John D. Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy and
David R. Young Jr. in the Ellsberg burglary case were
dismissed yesterday in favor of allowing federal prosecution
of the case to proceed.
The order came after attorneys for Ehrlichman and
Liddy objected to the dismissal procedures.
Ehrlichman and Liddy were indicted last week under
similar charges in a federal court in Washington, D.C., and
those charges are not affected by yesterday's state-level
action.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer granted a motion
by the Los Angeles district attorney to allow the
indictment of Ehrlichman to stand for one charge of
perjury. The judge said he expected the perjury trial to
proceed quickly, perhaps in April.
At the request of Ehrlichman's attorney, Ringer vacated
a subpoena that had commanded President Nixon to appear
at a pretrial hearing and at the April 15 trial. Attorney
Douglas Dalton, representing Ehrlichman, reserved the right
to seek another such subpoena if Nixon's testimony is seen
as material to the perjury charge.
Attorneys for both Liddy and Ehrlichman contended
that the dismissal in Los Angeles was engineered to give an
advantage to the federal government in prosecuting the two
former White House employees.
Panel Seeks Impeachment Material
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee said yesterday everything it has requested from
the White House for its impeachment inquiry is relevant
and should be supplied.
Responding to White House criticism of the request,
Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., said the committee is prepared
to subpoena the evidence if the White House refuses to
supply it.
Rodino's hard stand in favor of the committee's right to
evidence for its impeachment inquiry was fully supported
by Rep. Edward Hutchinson, R-Mich., the committee's
ranking Republican.
"The requests made to date are very reasonable," said
Hutchinson at a joint news conference with Rodino. "The
White House should be totally cooperative with us."
The two leaders of the impeachment panel said it was
their hope a confrontation with the White House over the
furnishing of evidence could be avoided, but that the
constitutional authority the committee is operating under
leaves the White House no room to refuse its request.
Senate Passes Death Penalty Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to restore
the death penalty for espionage, treason and certain other
federal crimes such as kidnaping and airplane hijacking that
result in death.
The vote was 54 to 33.
The bill, modified somewhat by amendments, now goes
to the House, where no early action on it is in prospect.
Urged by President Nixon a year ago, the bill is designed
to overcome a 1972 Supreme Court decision that the death
penalty, as applied under existing laws, was
unconstitutional.
The bill lists a number of aggravating factors which
would make the death penalty mandatory.
However, if any mitigating factors existed, such as being
under 18 years of age or having significantly impaired
mental capacity, a death sentence would be barred.
Other mitigating factors set out in the bill are acting

under unusual or substantial duress, being a relatively minor
participant in a crime, and not having been reasonably able
to foresee that one's conduct would cause a risk of death to
another.
SF Employees Continue To Picket
SAN FRANCISCO — Striking city workers threw up
new picket lines yesterday as police held off on arrests
ordered by a judge. Union negotiators rejected a new city
wage offer.
About 380,000 commuters were left without public
transit. The unions halted the normal daily flow of 500
buses across San Francisco Bay because bus drivers refused
to cross picket lines at the downtown East Bay terminal on
the strike's seventh day.
City buses, trolleys and cable cars were shut down last
Friday by pickets who also closed sewage plants and the
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) subway in San Francisco.
Lt. William O'Connor said police were studying a cou«-t
injunction received Tuesday night by Chief Don Scott. It
directs police to arrest pickets at sewage plants, the public
transit system terminals and two public hospitals.
Prisoners Ask Judge For TV Time
HILLSBOROUGH — A judge took under advisement
yesterday a request to give two prisoners a nationally
televised appearance which they claim could help save the
life of kidnaped heiress Patricia Hearst.
Attorneys for Russell Little, 24, and Joseph Remiro, 27,
asked Sam Hall to permit their clients to make an
appearance on television for five to 10 minutes. They said it
would be in a courtroom with only one camera and one
reporter present.
The judge said he would make a decision on Monday.
Attorneys later said he seemed reluctant to comply with
their request.
Remiro and Little, charged in Alameda County with
murdering Oakland School Supt. Marcus Foster, also are
charged in Contra Costa County with attempted murder
stemming from a shootout with police on Jan. 10.
Judge Hall said his decision would be based on the
Contra Costa case alone.
Reinecke Drops From Public View
SACRAMENTO — Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke slipped out of
public sight again yesterday.
If anyone knew where he was, they weren't saying.
"We don't have that information," said a secretary who
works for Reinecke's press aide, Earl Parker.
"He isn't in the office," said a secretary in Reinecke's
own office in the Capitol.
The new "disappearance" of the Republican candidate
for governor was similar to one last month when Reinecke
made a secret trip to Washington in an effort to "clear my
name" in the ITT scandal.
Speculation that he might have gone back to Washington
in that pursuit could not be substantiated.
One source said Reinecke was seen in his Capitol office
