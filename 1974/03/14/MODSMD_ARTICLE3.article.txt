# For Local Gas Stations
## Uniform Hours Asked 
### DAVID SMITH 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, three state legislators
and high-ranking members of the
National Service Station Dealers
Association (NSSDA) have proposed
that all San Mateo and Santa Clara
County gas stations be required to
open for two uniform periods
beginning at 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
and lasting at least one hour each.
The proposal was contained »n
letters delivered Monday to the boards
of supervisors of the two counties. It
grew out of a stormy "fact-finding"
meeting of local gas dealers,
government officials and oil-company
representatives summoned by
McCloskey last Friday afternoon in
Palo Alto.
At that meeting, McCloskey cited
three major gas-related problems for
local areas: apparently inequitable
distribution of gasoline within the
state, unfair distribution of gasoline
among individual stations and long
waiting lines at stations.
Two-Hour Meeting
He and the three state lawmakers,
Sen. Arlen Gregorio, D-San Mateo,
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R-Redwood City and Assemblyman
Louis Papan, D-Daly City, promised to
sup'poft the proposal a.' ti, oni
station operators, but the dealers and
local officials could agree on almost
nothing during the two-hour meeting.
The proposal that all stations be
open at uniform times, strongly
advocated by NSSDA President Don

Prince and NSSDA San Jose chapter
President Ken Davis, met opposition
from several service-station operators,
who proposed staggered-hours and
appointment plans instead. "I'm for a
call-in and walk-in appointment plan,"
stated a local dealer.
Several other dealers joined him in
voicing allegations that the oil
companies were holding back gas from
the dealers because of low prices.
"If the IRS can hit the service
stations, let them hit the oil
companies," Davis said. "I
surely think the possibility of
collusion between the Federal
government and the big oil companies
exists," said Arnett.
"We have no tankers laying
offshore, and our gas inventories are
no higher now than they were two
years ago," claimed Union Oil
company's manager of operations for
Northern California, one of only two
oil-company representatives at the
meeting.
"We're not a bit happy about the
shortage," said Ron Miller of Shell Oil.
"We were just forced to sell 180
million gallons of gas to the
government, and lots of our oil, undet
the law, is going to our competitors —
at rock-bottom prices."
That's the only way to avoid
lines." McCloskey noted that several
such plans had been ruled
discriminatory and illegal by courts.
