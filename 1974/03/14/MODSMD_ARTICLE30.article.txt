# Symposium To Honor Ellington
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Late in April, Stanford will honor
the great jazz musician Duke Ellington
in a four day symposium culminating
with his appearance (on his 75th
birthday) to present the American
premier of his third "Sacred Concert,"
ASSU Special Events Director Dan
Scher told the Daily yesterday.
The symposium, sponsored by
Special Events and beginning Friday,
April 26, will feature individual
presentations aimed at "pinpointing
Ellington's contributions, providing a
chronological sketch of the man,"
according to Scher.
Scher emphasizes that the
symposium features "a lot of free
admission events." On Friday, Phillip
Ellwood, KPFA radio personality, San
Francisco Chronicle film critic, and
owner of the country's most complete
Ellington record collection, will speak
about "Ellington on Record" and will
play selections.
On Saturday, Jon Hendricks, vocal
soloist in Ellington's first "Sacred
Concert" will perform in "Hendricks
Sings Ellington." There will be a $2
student admission charge.
On Sunday afternoon, Ernie Smith,

a noted private film collector, will
present "rare footage of Ellington,"
according to Scher, in "Ellington on
Film." In the evening, Stanley Dance,
a personal friend of Ellington since
1933, will speak on "The World Of
Duke Ellington."
The symposium's six events, will
reach fruition with the American
premiere of Ellington's third "Sacred
Concert" on Monday. The concert, to
be held in Memorial Church, will
feature the entire Ellington Orchestra
and the sixty voice Stanford choir.
The "Sacred Concert" is "not a jazz
mass but a concert of sacred music,
things he's most sensitive to,"
according to Scher. "He is very
religious and this is his offering."
Ellington presented the first "Sacred
Concert" at Glide Memorial Church in
1965 and this concert had its world
premiere last November before the
Queen of England at Westminster
Abbey.
Two performances of the third
"Sacred Concert" will be presented.
The afternoon performance, Scher
says, is aimed at students and will cost
$2.50. The evening performance is
aimed at the entire community and
admission is $10.

Scher points out that Ellington's
appearance at Stanford is truly a
special event, commenting, "We
weren't the only place that wanted
him." Scher emphasizes that "Duke"
celebrated his 70th birthday at the
White House.
Scher expects the program to "do
very well. The University is very
excited about it too," he says. He is
also preparing a commermorative
program, "featuring contributions
from major jazz writers, musicians and
theologiansâ€”people influenced by
Duke, like Basie, Woody Herman, and
Leonard Bernstein."
