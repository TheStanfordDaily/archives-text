# Freshman Streakers Strike Golden Gate Bridge
## The 						Stanford Daily 
### RONALD BECK 
Golden Gate Bridge commuters were
treated to a special surprise last Friday
afternoon when a group of about 45 Branner
iall freshmen streaked alongside them.
"Stanford may not be number one in
basketball or football, but we're number one
in streaking," said one of the streakers.
The Branner Hall group, who call
themselves "Bay Area Runners Extraordinaire
-Association of Stanford Streakers"
(BARE-ASS) ran almost two-thirds of a mile
across the famous span. Clad only in hats,
shoes and Stanford regalia, the streakers
pulled off one of the most imaginative
streaking stunts of the evidently recently

opened streaking season.
Making sure that they had good press
coverage before they made the trek up to San
Francisco, BARE-ASS handed out press
release previews at the run.
Streak Route
The streakers then unclothed at the north
tower of the bridge, ran almost a third of a
mile to Vista Point on the Marin County side,
made a turnaround so that cameramen could
get some printable pictures, and returned to
the tower.
The Golden Gate streakers caused a traffic
jam of "massive" proportions, according to
one California Highway Patrol officer. He
added that he wished the streakers would have

picked some time other than rush hour to "do
their thing," but officers made no arrests.
One of the streakers, Lynn de Paur, said
that she had never seen anything like it.
"People were stopping on the middle of the
bridge to take pictures and watch."
"One truck driver, who was going the
opposite way, blasted one of those big air
horns at us for about a minute. People were
laughing, smiling, shaking their fists, and
yelling at us during the whole streak."
The organization's press release announced
that BARE-ASS was trying to put Stanford at
the top of the list of streaking schools. The
press release specifically issued a challenge to
"Harvard, Yale, and the Cal Berkeley weenies"
to try and top the "imagination and heroics"
of the deed.
Campus Streakers
The campus also had its share of streakers.
Two male and two female streakers hit White
Plaza during the crowded noon hour last
Friday.
Meanwhile, a streaking party of about 25
Theta Delts blitzed through several campus
parties and six guys streaked in the daylight in
front of Memorial Auditorium.
The White Plaza streakers, attempting to
attract attention, got little notice from the
uninterested crowds. One of the bystanders
commented that, "They weren't much to look
at."
The Theta Delts made sure they got
noticed. "We g6t back from this party," one
Theta Delt said, "and we were all a bit rowdy,
so someone said 'Hey, let's streak,' and we
were off."
Their streaking led them through a Phi Delt
party, a Sigma Chi party at which all the
streakers got cornered at an end of the
building and were forced to jump out of a
high window, a run through both floors of the
women's dorm in Florence Moore, and finally
through another party at Gavilan.
Flicks Streak
Other streakers warned ASSU Flicks
personnel that they were going to streak

through last Sunday's movies, but that run
never materialized — at least not inside
Memorial Auditorium.
Before the early show, six Lagunita
residents ran right in front of people waiting
to buy tickets. Their streak occurred so fast
that only a few of the people noticed them.

And it looks as if streaking will be here at
least a little while longer. BARE-ASS
organizers won't commit themselves to any
future streak, but one of them admits that
they are at least thinking about doing
something "even more spectacular than the
Golden Gate streak, if that's possible."

Golden Gate Bridge commuters were
treated to a special surprise last Friday
afternoon when a group of about 45 Branner
iall freshmen streaked alongside them.
"Stanford may not be number one in
basketball or football, but we're number one
in streaking," said one of the streakers.
The Branner Hall group, who call
themselves "Bay Area Runners Extraordinaire
-Association of Stanford Streakers"
(BARE-ASS) ran almost two-thirds of a mile
across the famous span. Clad only in hats,
shoes and Stanford regalia, the streakers
pulled off one of the most imaginative
streaking stunts of the evidently recently

opened streaking season.
Making sure that they had good press
coverage before they made the trek up to San
Francisco, BARE-ASS handed out press
release previews at the run.
Streak Route
The streakers then unclothed at the north
tower of the bridge, ran almost a third of a
mile to Vista Point on the Marin County side,
made a turnaround so that cameramen could
get some printable pictures, and returned to
the tower.
The Golden Gate streakers caused a traffic
jam of "massive" proportions, according to
one California Highway Patrol officer. He
added that he wished the streakers would have

picked some time other than rush hour to "do
their thing," but officers made no arrests.
One of the streakers, Lynn de Paur, said
that she had never seen anything like it.
"People were stopping on the middle of the
bridge to take pictures and watch."
"One truck driver, who was going the
opposite way, blasted one of those big air
horns at us for about a minute. People were
laughing, smiling, shaking their fists, and
yelling at us during the whole streak."
The organization's press release announced
that BARE-ASS was trying to put Stanford at
the top of the list of streaking schools. The
press release specifically issued a challenge to
"Harvard, Yale, and the Cal Berkeley weenies"
to try and top the "imagination and heroics"
of the deed.
Campus Streakers
The campus also had its share of streakers.
Two male and two female streakers hit White
Plaza during the crowded noon hour last
Friday.
Meanwhile, a streaking party of about 25
Theta Delts blitzed through several campus
parties and six guys streaked in the daylight in
front of Memorial Auditorium.
The White Plaza streakers, attempting to
attract attention, got little notice from the
uninterested crowds. One of the bystanders
commented that, "They weren't much to look
at."
The Theta Delts made sure they got
noticed. "We g6t back from this party," one
Theta Delt said, "and we were all a bit rowdy,
so someone said 'Hey, let's streak,' and we
were off."
Their streaking led them through a Phi Delt
party, a Sigma Chi party at which all the
streakers got cornered at an end of the
building and were forced to jump out of a
high window, a run through both floors of the
women's dorm in Florence Moore, and finally
through another party at Gavilan.
Flicks Streak
Other streakers warned ASSU Flicks
personnel that they were going to streak

through last Sunday's movies, but that run
never materialized — at least not inside
Memorial Auditorium.
Before the early show, six Lagunita
residents ran right in front of people waiting
to buy tickets. Their streak occurred so fast
that only a few of the people noticed them.

And it looks as if streaking will be here at
least a little while longer. BARE-ASS
organizers won't commit themselves to any
future streak, but one of them admits that
they are at least thinking about doing
something "even more spectacular than the
Golden Gate streak, if that's possible."
