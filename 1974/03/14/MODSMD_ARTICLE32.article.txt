# Econ Students Again Demand Expanded Marxian Program
## 
### JOHN FREED CHESS ERWIN 
Charging that faculty members have
been "unresponsive," economics
students supporting a Marxian
economics program have repeated
their demands for further expansion of
the program.
The Union for Radical Political
Economics (URPE), representing the
dissatisfied students, last week released
a statement attacking
recommendations made last month by
faculty members. The guidelines
would establish a graduate field in
"alternative approaches to economic
analysis."
Economics department chairman
Moses Abramovitz implied that
URPE's action is premature.
No Patience
"URPE is showing no patience," he
noted, adding that they have
circumvented the normal flow of ideas
through departmental machinery.
But Don Harris, visiting economics
professor and advocate of radical
economics, suggested that the faculty
recommendations hadn't really met
the students' original demands.
"[The proposals] are biased
towards the graduate students.
Undergrads have, to some degree, been
left out. The alternative approaches'
proposal is clearly directed to the
graduates," Harris observed.
More Manpower
"If the real objective is to provide a
broad-based undergraduate program in
Marxian economics, the department is
going to need some more manpower,"
he added.
Abramovitz, pointing to the faculty
decision to search for an economist
who would add strength to the

"alternative approaches" field, argued
that the department would be getting
needed manpower.
URPE maintains that the
manpower increase will not be
sufficient to handle the increasing
workload. Presently, Prof. John
Gurley is the only tenured professor
here with experience in that field.
Abramovitz contended the faculty
action will allow Gurley to devote
more time to both graduates and
undergraduates.
Gurley 'Freer'
"Jack Gurley will be freer [next
year]he stated.
URPE has argued that Gurley
customarily devotes full time to
teaching undergraduate courses and
cannot be expected to increase his
teaching load.
In addition, URPE claims that
faculty members reject Marxian
economist on ideological grounds,

Harris commented.
"I have heard no worthwhile
arguments against Marxian economics.
[Other faculty members] view all
other approaches as inferior to their
own. There has really been no serious
discussion of alternatives," such as
Marxian economics, Harris stated.
'Long-Term Interests'
Abramovitz countered by saying
faculty members keep in mind the
"long-term interests" of the
department in making decisions on
curriculum. Many steps have already
been taken to expand the field of
radical economics, he added.
"A great deal has been done to
replay to graduates in getting facilities
to study Marxian economics;
"For example, the Marxian
economics workshop that is now a
regular departmental seminar, a
graduate theory course on Marx, Don

Harris' courses, and the recently
approved graduate field of study in
'alternative approaches to economic
analysis,' " Abramovitz observed.
Abramovitz further acused URPE
of trying to "needle the faculty" on
the issue.
One of URPE's responses to the
faculty decisions has been to try to
establish two seminars concerning the
conflict between so-called
"neo-classical" or orthodox
economics, and radical economics.
URPE issued a statement lamenting
faculty apathy toward the programs.
Neo-classicists have refused to attack
Marxian economics in this forum,
according to URPE. This occurs
because faculty members view radical
economics as inferior, they claim.
"This is an objectionable judgment
which is made out of ignorance of the
historical background and traditions of
Marxian economics. Such ignorance is
self-replicating through the training
that the graduate students receive,"
Harris contended.

he added.
Abramovitz, pointing to the faculty
decision to search for an economist
who would add strength to the

"alternative approaches" field, argued
that the department would be getting
needed manpower.
URPE maintains that the
manpower increase will not be
sufficient to handle the increasing
workload. Presently, Prof. John
Gurley is the only tenured professor
here with experience in that field.
Abramovitz contended the faculty
action will allow Gurley to devote
more time to both graduates and
undergraduates.

URPE has argued that Gurley
customarily devotes full time to
teaching undergraduate courses and

In addition, URPE claims that
faculty members reject Marxian
economist on ideological grounds,

Harris commented.
"I have heard no worthwhile
arguments against Marxian economics.
[Other faculty members] view all
other approaches as inferior to their
own. There has really been no serious
discussion of alternatives," such as
Marxian economics, Harris stated.
'Long-Term Interests'
Abramovitz countered by saying
faculty members keep in mind the
"long-term interests" of the
department in making decisions on
curriculum. Many steps have already
been taken to expand the field of
radical economics, he added.

Neo-classicists have refused to attack

students supporting a Marxian
economics program have repeated
their demands for further expansion of
the program.
The Union for Radical Political
Economics (URPE), representing the
dissatisfied students, last week released
a statement attacking
recommendations made last month by
faculty members. The guidelines
would establish a graduate field in

noted, adding that they have
