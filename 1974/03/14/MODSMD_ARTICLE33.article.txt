# Rhinelander: 'Norms Useful'
## Prof Defends Social Authority 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Freedom for individuals is best
insured by the existence of social
authority, Philip Rhinelander,
emeritus professor of humanities and
philosophy, declared in a speech
Tuesday evening.
Addressing 250 people in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Rhinelander
defended the usefulness of social
norms, calling them the strongest
defense against tyranny. Rhinelander
spoke as part of the Tuesday Evening
Lecture Series.
"All norms function as guides to
conduct and only secondarily as
punishment for misconduct,"
Rhinelander stated. "They allow us to
do what we could not otherwise do."
Language
Rhinelander cited language as an
example of a system that people
follow willingly in order to facilitate
certain goals.
The concept of the usefulness of
norms can be applied to authority
within a university, Rhinelander
stated. In order to disseminate
knowledge, professors with superior
experience must be deferred to in
questions involving intellectual
matters, he explained.
'The very concept of community
entails the acceptance of certain
norms," Rhinelander declared. "A
community without norms is a
contradiction in terms."

Rhinelander noted that the norms
of American society have often been
criticized and admitted that many
such complaints are justifiable.
Better Norms
But the only way to remedy a bad
norm is to replace it with a better one,
he insisted.
The extent to which sanctions are
needed to enforce the norms depends
upon one's view of human nature,
Rhinelander contended. Although the
term 'human nature' seems to refer to

a nebulous concept, lawmakers and
philosophers must not be afraid to
define it, he said. Only when it is
defined can the proper degree of
sanctions be imposed upon society.
Rhinelander expressed
disagreement with the definition of
man as basically a good creature, as
propounded by Rousseau and
generations of anarchists. But he also
criticized the view of man as
intrinsically evil, as propounded by
Hobbes and authoritarian societies.
Constitution
Human nature lies between the two
concepts, Rhinelander stated. The
American Constitution, as interpreted
by the Supreme Court, seems to agree
with this contention, he noted.
Hence, the belief in norms and
sanctions to enforce them is consistent
with the principles upon which the
nation is founded, he stated. The
American philosophical tradition of
pragmatism as articulated by Dewey,
James and Whitehead also recognizes
this fact, Rhinelander emphasized.
Pragmatism teaches that freedom is
a valid concept only as far as it can be
obtained. The only rational way to
obtain it is through the imposition of
certain controls, Rhinelander argued.
Expressing concern over the current
mood of national cynicism toward
national institutions, Rhinelander said
that when authority breaks down, the
way is open for a dictator.

entails the acceptance of certain
norms," Rhinelander declared. "A
community without norms is a
contradiction in terms."

Rhinelander noted that the norms
of American society have often been
criticized and admitted that many
such complaints are justifiable.
Better Norms
But the only way to remedy a bad
norm is to replace it with a better one,
he insisted.
The extent to which sanctions are
needed to enforce the norms depends
upon one's view of human nature,
Rhinelander contended. Although the
term 'human nature' seems to refer to

a nebulous concept, lawmakers and
philosophers must not be afraid to
define it, he said. Only when it is
defined can the proper degree of
sanctions be imposed upon society.
Rhinelander expressed
disagreement with the definition of
man as basically a good creature, as
propounded by Rousseau and
generations of anarchists. But he also
criticized the view of man as
intrinsically evil, as propounded by
Hobbes and authoritarian societies.
Constitution
Human nature lies between the two
concepts, Rhinelander stated. The
American Constitution, as interpreted
by the Supreme Court, seems to agree
with this contention, he noted.
Hence, the belief in norms and
sanctions to enforce them is consistent
with the principles upon which the
nation is founded, he stated. The
American philosophical tradition of
pragmatism as articulated by Dewey,
James and Whitehead also recognizes
this fact, Rhinelander emphasized.
Pragmatism teaches that freedom is
a valid concept only as far as it can be
obtained. The only rational way to
obtain it is through the imposition of
certain controls, Rhinelander argued.
Expressing concern over the current
mood of national cynicism toward
national institutions, Rhinelander said
that when authority breaks down, the
way is open for a dictator.

PHILIP RHINELANDER
Freedom for individuals is best
insured by the existence of social
authority, Philip Rhinelander,
emeritus professor of humanities and
philosophy, declared in a speech
Tuesday evening.
Addressing 250 people in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Rhinelander
defended the usefulness of social
norms, calling them the strongest
defense against tyranny. Rhinelander
spoke as part of the Tuesday Evening
Lecture Series.
"All norms function as guides to
conduct and only secondarily as
punishment for misconduct,"
Rhinelander stated. "They allow us to
do what we could not otherwise do."
Language
Rhinelander cited language as an
example of a system that people
follow willingly in order to facilitate
certain goals.
The concept of the usefulness of
norms can be applied to authority
within a university, Rhinelander
stated. In order to disseminate
knowledge, professors with superior
experience must be deferred to in
questions involving intellectual
matters, he explained.
'The very concept of community
entails the acceptance of certain
norms," Rhinelander declared. "A
community without norms is a
contradiction in terms."

Rhinelander noted that the norms
of American society have often been
criticized and admitted that many
such complaints are justifiable.
