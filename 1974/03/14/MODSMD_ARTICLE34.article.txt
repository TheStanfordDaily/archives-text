# Publisher Analyzes Media Problems

### NANCI COLVERT 
"We, the press, have not been as
right [in Watergate] as we've been
given credit for. If we crow about it, it
will come back to haunt us."
Speaking to a group of about 60
students in Communication 2258
Tuesday afternoon, Los Angeles Times
publisher Otis Chandler expressed this
as one of his concerns about the
present state of the mass media.
"In my opinion, if and when Nixon
leavps office there will be a depression
because the problems of
unemployment, the energy crisis and

the Middle East will remain.
"People will want a new scapegoat
and they'll turn on the press because
we are the ones who damaged the
office of the presidency," Chandler
said.
Uneasiness Over Case
He also expressed uneasiness over a
case currently before the U.S.
Supreme Court which, if upheld,
would give public access to the press in
sweeping terms.
The case involves the Miami Herald
which was sued by the loser of a local
election whom the paper had not

endorsed. The legality of the suit was
upheld in the lower courts which
maintained that the unendorsed
candidate had, under an old state
statute, a legal right of reply which the
Herald had refused to grant.
If upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court, it would mean that every time a
newspaper endorsed a candidate, it
would be required to give all other
candidates equal space and equal play
in its pages, Chandler said.
"It would be government
intervention in what we print that
might extend to the coverage of issues
and even what we print in our news
columns. This would force us to print
facts only â€” births, deaths, fires and so
on.
No News Analysis
"It would force us to take out any
investigative reporting or news analysis
as well as our editorial pages.
Otherwise, we would have to
completely fill our pages with replies,"
he said.
Speaking about the growing trend
towards media concentration,
Chandler estimated that the 10 largest
media conglomerates in the United
States own 80 percent of the media
outlets.
He cited the example of Western
Germany where one man owns both
the country's major serious and
popular papers, as well as hard and
soft cover publishing concerns and
electronic media holdings.
Closer to home, he mentioned
Cheyenne, Wyo., where the local
newspaper, television, AM and FM
radio stations and CATV channel are
all jointly owned.
New Newspaper
Chandler also expressed concern
over the efforts of Rupert Murdock,
an Australian, who currently has
substantial newspaper holdings in
England, to start a new national
newspaper here in the U.S. The paper
aims to cover the less educated and
middle class market which papers like
the Wall Street Journal and New York
Times miss, he said.
It would be along the lines of the
National Enquirer, "only worse,"
Chandler remarked.
Named The Star, the paper's first
edition sold nearly 1.5 million issues

on the north east coast, and Murdock
expects to reach a national circulation
of 5 million in six months.
"His theory that the market for
such a paper exists has already been
partially proven by the New York
Daily News which has the largest daily
circulation in the country at over two
million.
The Star would be a weekly of
approximately 26 pages, and would
sell for 25 cents.
Chandler sees the newsstand price
of most daily newspapers also rising to
25 cents in the near future.
