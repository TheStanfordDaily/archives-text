# Mancall Shows Optimism About Overseas Plan

Mark Mancall, director of the
overseas studies office, said Tuesday
that while administrative problems
have increased with the addition of
many new programs, the programs are
still "educationally valid" and the
problems can be overcome.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, prerecorded Tuesday
morning, Mancall said greater
problems have arisen as the overseas
office extends itself into new
programs, but "they aren't going to
kill us and we'll just learn to live with
them."
Following the release of the new
overseas programs some faculty
expressed concern that the overseas
office might be overextending itself.
Mancall defended the new slate of
programs on the grounds that
programs before "have been incredibly
Eurocentric."
Non-European Areas
"Non-European areas are becoming
increasingly more important. We are
short-changing the University as a
whole not to have available facilities in
these new areas," he said.
"You can only stick your head in
the sand for so long."
Mancall said that the overseas office
was looking into plans to increase the
accessibility of the overseas programs
to students currently unable to
participate because of financial
limitations.
"We are profoundly committed
that the programs must be available to
all students," said Mancall.
'Province of Wealthy'
Mancall said he hoped the overseas
programs would never become a
"province of the wealthy."
"I would not administer such a
situation," he added.
Mancall said there was a
misunderstanding among faculty and
students with respect to language
proficiency requirements coupled to
the new programs.
"We are concerned that students
gain a knowledge of a new language
and learn it as well as they can," he
said.
Mancall said that language programs

here and overseas needed an "injection
of realism."
The number of quarters a student
studies a language is not meaningful,
he said. "I don't think academic
bookkeeping will tell us the amount of
knowledge on his head."
Mancall said there was the
possibility of overseas programs for
alumni in the future.
"What we're thinking of is utilizing
overseas campuses when it is possible,

for alumni programs," he said.
"We are quite committed to the
concept of continuing education. It
does not end when you graduate."
Mancall said that doctors might be
interested in going to the
Stanford-in-Britain campus at Clivedon
to study alternative health care
systems.
Mancall said such programs might
be possible since students found it
difficult to go overseas during the
summer and the campuses did not fill.
