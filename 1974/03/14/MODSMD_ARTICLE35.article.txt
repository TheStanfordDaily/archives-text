# Mancall Shows Optimism About Overseas Plan

Mark Mancall, director of the
overseas studies office, said Tuesday
that while administrative problems
have increased with the addition of
many new programs, the programs are
still "educationally valid" and the
problems can be overcome.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, prerecorded Tuesday
morning, Mancall said greater
problems have arisen as the overseas
office extends itself into new
programs, but "they aren't going to
kill us and we'll just learn to live with
them."
Following the release of the new
overseas programs some faculty
expressed concern that the overseas
office might be overextending itself.
Mancall defended the new slate of
programs on the grounds that
programs before "have been incredibly
Eurocentric."
Non-European Areas
"Non-European areas are becoming
increasingly more important. We are
short-changing the University as a
whole not to have available facilities in
these new areas," he said.
"You can only stick your head in
the sand for so long."
Mancall said that the overseas office
was looking into plans to increase the
accessibility of the overseas programs
to students currently unable to
participate because of financial
limitations.
"We are profoundly committed
that the programs must be available to
all students," said Mancall.
'Province of Wealthy'
Mancall said he hoped the overseas
programs would never become a
"province of the wealthy."
