# Van Den Haag Opposes Impeachment Of President
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Sufficient grounds do not exist to
justify the impeachment of President
Nixon, Ernest van den Haag, author
and professor of social philosophy at
New York University, told an audience
of 75 in the Meyer Library Forum
Room Friday.
"When the Constitution refers to
'high crimes' as grounds for
impeachment, it does not mean
displeasing Congress, dipping into
petty cash or not filling out tax
forms," van den Haag stated. "Rather,
'high crimes' refers to treason or
dictatorship."
Van den Haag spoke as a guest of
the Conservative Forum. His remarks
were followed by a panel discussion
featuring Bill Evers, research assistant
at Hoover Institution, and Brent
Appel, former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents*.
No Justification
"We don't know how true the
accusations against the President are,"
van den Haag explained in his speech.
"There is no indication that the
President has been involved [in the
Watergate scandal]. Even if he were
involved, there would be no
justification for the drastic measure of
impeachment."
Van den Haag called Nixon the
"most effective President in 50 years."
He praised Nixon's accomplishments

in promoting world peace and
domestic harmony. Even if a President
stole a million dollars, he should be
retained in office if he could make
correct decisions regarding the
allocation of ten billion dollars, van
den Haag argued.
Surveillance
In the panel discussion, Evers
pointed out that Nixon's approval of
the Huston Plan, and of a system for
the implementation of extensive
electronic surveillance seems to
constitute 'high crimes.' A President is
in a unique position to carry out
invasions of privacy, he noted.
Evers also cited Nixon's alleged
setting of milk import quotas in return
for campaign contributions as evidence
of 'high crimes.'
But van den Haag insisted that
extensive electronic surveillance was
carried out under the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations. "Sometimes
it is necessary to invade privacy to
stop crimes."
Van den Haag contended that the
contributions of the milk producers to
Nixon's reelection campaign were not
necessarily the result of the favorable
milk quotas set by the Nixon
Administration.
Appel argued that although Nixon
may be innocent of criminal acts, he
deserves a hearing.
"I am asking that we give Nixon the
due process of law," Appel said.
"Impeachment is the only
constitutional vehicle for due
process."
Appel cited numerous examples of
the subversion of the Bill of Rights by
the Nixon administration such as the
break-in at Daniel Ellsbeig's
psychiatrist's office.
"Nixon doesn't react to
constitutional restraints," Appel
stated. "That is why I am surprised
that a conservative such as Mr. van den
Haag is not calling for his
impeachment."
In reply, van den Haag claimed that
the present investigation of the
Watergate affair by a Senate
committee is a proper way to give the
President due process.
The institution of the Presidency
would be harmed by the impeachment
of Nixon, van den Haag said.

contributions of the milk producers to
Nixon's reelection campaign were not
necessarily the result of the favorable
milk quotas set by the Nixon
Administration.
Appel argued that although Nixon
may be innocent of criminal acts, he
deserves a hearing.
"I am asking that we give Nixon the
due process of law," Appel said.
"Impeachment is the only
constitutional vehicle for due
process."
Appel cited numerous examples of
the subversion of the Bill of Rights by
the Nixon administration such as the
break-in at Daniel Ellsbeig's
psychiatrist's office.
"Nixon doesn't react to
constitutional restraints," Appel
stated. "That is why I am surprised
that a conservative such as Mr. van den
Haag is not calling for his
impeachment."
In reply, van den Haag claimed that
the present investigation of the
Watergate affair by a Senate
committee is a proper way to give the
President due process.
The institution of the Presidency
would be harmed by the impeachment
of Nixon, van den Haag said.
Sufficient grounds do not exist to
justify the impeachment of President
Nixon, Ernest van den Haag, author
and professor of social philosophy at
New York University, told an audience
of 75 in the Meyer Library Forum
Room Friday.
"When the Constitution refers to
'high crimes' as grounds for
impeachment, it does not mean
displeasing Congress, dipping into
petty cash or not filling out tax
forms," van den Haag stated. "Rather,
'high crimes' refers to treason or
dictatorship."
Van den Haag spoke as a guest of
the Conservative Forum. His remarks
were followed by a panel discussion
featuring Bill Evers, research assistant
at Hoover Institution, and Brent
Appel, former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents*.
No Justification
"We don't know how true the
accusations against the President are,"
van den Haag explained in his speech.
"There is no indication that the
President has been involved [in the
Watergate scandal]. Even if he were
involved, there would be no
justification for the drastic measure of
impeachment."
Van den Haag called Nixon the
"most effective President in 50 years."
He praised Nixon's accomplishments

in promoting world peace and
domestic harmony. Even if a President
stole a million dollars, he should be
retained in office if he could make
correct decisions regarding the
allocation of ten billion dollars, van
den Haag argued.
Surveillance
In the panel discussion, Evers
pointed out that Nixon's approval of
the Huston Plan, and of a system for
the implementation of extensive
electronic surveillance seems to
constitute 'high crimes.' A President is
in a unique position to carry out
invasions of privacy, he noted.
Evers also cited Nixon's alleged
setting of milk import quotas in return
for campaign contributions as evidence
of 'high crimes.'
But van den Haag insisted that
extensive electronic surveillance was
carried out under the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations. "Sometimes
it is necessary to invade privacy to
stop crimes."
Van den Haag contended that the
contributions of the milk producers to
Nixon's reelection campaign were not
necessarily the result of the favorable
milk quotas set by the Nixon
Administration.
Appel argued that although Nixon
may be innocent of criminal acts, he
