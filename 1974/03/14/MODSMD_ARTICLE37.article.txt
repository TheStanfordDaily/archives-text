# Ravi Shankar Shows Rare Genius
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO - "Mr.
Shankar has requested that there
be no smoking, no picture taking,
and no sound recording during the
performance."
Only one flashless camera
clicks during the next three hours,
and the only smoke in Masonic
Auditorium drifts up from the
incense burning within a golden
circle of light at center stage.
As one member of the
audience said after Ravi Shankar's
performance, "He demands
attention, and he gets it."
It is difficult to imagine Ravi
Shankar demanding attention or
anything else. Preceded by his two
accompanists — if tabla master
Alia Rakha can be called such a
thing — Shankar walks quietly
onto the stage dressed in white
except for a dark vest.
Daisies, Roses
Bowing to his audience,
Shankar sits crosslegged between
his fellow musicians on an Indian
carpet. In front of the carpet are
daisies, roses, and one fresh
pineapple that members of the
audience have brought for the
master.
Shankar explains that the first

raga is a late evening raga with a
seven beat tala, or rhythmic cycle,
divided three-two-two.
As a description of what is to
follow, Shankar's words are as
effective as trying to describe
color to a blind man. The music
must be heard.
The lyric prelude of the raga,
the alap, combines rapid melodies
from Shankar's sitar with the
hypnotic drone of the tamboura,
a four-stringed background
instrument. The inter-twining,
slow, invocative beginning gains
speed, and crescendoes toward the
gat, the rhythmic second section
of the raga.
Rakha Bored
Throughout the a alap Alia
Rakha looks bored, sitting behind
the tabla, two drums tuned to a
tonic, dominant, or sub-dominant
and a bass tone. As he awaits his
entrance, Rakha tunes the
higher-pitched drum with a small
hammer.
Rakha and Shankar begin a
disagreement over when Rakha
should enter the raga. Shankar
builds to crescendo, glances
sideways at Rakha, who taps his
drums once or twice and then
stops. Shankar pounds his foot on

the floor in anticipation, yet
Rakha waits.
Throughout the evening, the
two masters attempt to trick each
other, playing an elaborate
musical game. Shankar plays a
pattern which he dares Rakha to
duplicate on the tabla, and Rakha
follows effortlessly. Like the very
best of jazz musicians, the two
improvise as though they have
only one mind.
Shankar and Rakha finally
combine on the gat, and build to
an overwhelming climax which
brings thunderous applause from
the audience. The applause seems
even louder because it begins so
suddenly and spontaneously,
shattering the silence following
the last note.
Spring Festival
The second raga is Raga
Mishrakafi, dedicated to the
Indian spring festival which
commemorates an evening 5000
years ago when Lord Krishna
made love to 10,000 lovely
milkmaids by the light of the lull
moon. This raga is amazingly
happy with a certain soaring
loveliness.
The second half of the program
begins with an amazing tabla solo
by Rakha in jhaptala, or a
two-five-two-five 10 beat cycle,
Shankar claps out and explains
the rhythm to the audience.

pounding his foot on the floor to
emphasize the sum, the first beat
of each cycle.
Rakha, aside from being
perhaps the world's foremost
tabla player, is probably Indian
music's foremost ham. He first
sings a rhythmic section, gesturing
to Shankar as if to say, "You just
think I can't play that." Rakha
then proceeds to duplicate both in
rhythm and tone what he has
sung. It is an amazing
demonstration of both the
instrument and the musician.
Rakha leaves the stage as
Shankar explains that the next
raga came to him as an inspiration
as he was traveling to the grave of
his guru for a memorial
celebration. It is the first public
performance of the piece.
Dark, Foreboding
Without the rhythmic
accompaniment of the tabla,
Shankar demonstrates his solo
playing in a three section raga
which communicates both dark,
foreboding longing and a flight of
the soul. Interlaced between the
two moods are moments of
profound peace.
The final notes of the raga fade
slowly, and the audience
maintains the silence Shankar has
asked for to follow his tribute.
The final raga is a dhun, an air
or melody from Indian folk music

put into classical style. Shankar's
dhun floats gracefully and leaves
the audience high. After the
darkness of the preceding piece,
the feeling is welcome.
Toward the end of the gat,
Shankar and Rakha trade solos.
Shankar first plays a rapid
sequence on the si tar, and Rakha
follows with a near imitation on
the tabla. This rapid crossfire
between the two musicians is
tremendously impressive, and
makes the climax of the evening
that much more exhilarating.
The standing ovation was
immediate and long, and the
audience left the auditorium
slowly. Three hours in the
presence of one of the world's
absolute musical geniuses left
some giddy, some tranquil, some
silent, and probably left all
grasping for some way to define
the excellence they had just
heard.

and no sound recording during the
performance."
Only one flashless camera
clicks during the next three hours,
and the only smoke in Masonic
Auditorium drifts up from the
incense burning within a golden
circle of light at center stage.
As one member of the
audience said after Ravi Shankar's
performance, "He demands
attention, and he gets it."
It is difficult to imagine Ravi
Shankar demanding attention or
anything else. Preceded by his two
accompanists — if tabla master
Alia Rakha can be called such a
thing — Shankar walks quietly
onto the stage dressed in white
except for a dark vest.
Daisies, Roses
Bowing to his audience,
Shankar sits crosslegged between
his fellow musicians on an Indian
carpet. In front of the carpet are
daisies, roses, and one fresh
pineapple that members of the
audience have brought for the
master.
Shankar explains that the first

raga is a late evening raga with a
seven beat tala, or rhythmic cycle,
divided three-two-two.
As a description of what is to
follow, Shankar's words are as
effective as trying to describe
color to a blind man. The music
must be heard.
The lyric prelude of the raga,
the alap, combines rapid melodies
from Shankar's sitar with the
hypnotic drone of the tamboura,
a four-stringed background
instrument. The inter-twining,
slow, invocative beginning gains
speed, and crescendoes toward the
gat, the rhythmic second section
of the raga.
Rakha Bored
Throughout the a alap Alia
Rakha looks bored, sitting behind
the tabla, two drums tuned to a
tonic, dominant, or sub-dominant
and a bass tone. As he awaits his
entrance, Rakha tunes the
higher-pitched drum with a small
hammer.
Rakha and Shankar begin a
disagreement over when Rakha
should enter the raga. Shankar
builds to crescendo, glances
sideways at Rakha, who taps his
drums once or twice and then
stops. Shankar pounds his foot on

the floor in anticipation, yet
Rakha waits.
Throughout the evening, the
two masters attempt to trick each
other, playing an elaborate
musical game. Shankar plays a
pattern which he dares Rakha to
duplicate on the tabla, and Rakha
follows effortlessly. Like the very
best of jazz musicians, the two
improvise as though they have
only one mind.
Shankar and Rakha finally
combine on the gat, and build to
an overwhelming climax which
brings thunderous applause from
the audience. The applause seems
even louder because it begins so
suddenly and spontaneously,
shattering the silence following
the last note.
Spring Festival
The second raga is Raga
Mishrakafi, dedicated to the
Indian spring festival which
commemorates an evening 5000
years ago when Lord Krishna
made love to 10,000 lovely
milkmaids by the light of the lull
moon. This raga is amazingly
happy with a certain soaring
loveliness.
The second half of the program
begins with an amazing tabla solo
by Rakha in jhaptala, or a
two-five-two-five 10 beat cycle,
Shankar claps out and explains
the rhythm to the audience.

pounding his foot on the floor to
emphasize the sum, the first beat
of each cycle.
Rakha, aside from being
perhaps the world's foremost
tabla player, is probably Indian
music's foremost ham. He first
sings a rhythmic section, gesturing
to Shankar as if to say, "You just
think I can't play that." Rakha
then proceeds to duplicate both in
rhythm and tone what he has
sung. It is an amazing
demonstration of both the
instrument and the musician.
Rakha leaves the stage as
Shankar explains that the next
raga came to him as an inspiration
as he was traveling to the grave of
his guru for a memorial
celebration. It is the first public
performance of the piece.
Dark, Foreboding
Without the rhythmic
accompaniment of the tabla,
Shankar demonstrates his solo
playing in a three section raga
which communicates both dark,
foreboding longing and a flight of
the soul. Interlaced between the
two moods are moments of
profound peace.
The final notes of the raga fade
slowly, and the audience
maintains the silence Shankar has
asked for to follow his tribute.
The final raga is a dhun, an air
or melody from Indian folk music

put into classical style. Shankar's
dhun floats gracefully and leaves
the audience high. After the
darkness of the preceding piece,
the feeling is welcome.
Toward the end of the gat,
Shankar and Rakha trade solos.
Shankar first plays a rapid
sequence on the si tar, and Rakha
follows with a near imitation on
the tabla. This rapid crossfire
between the two musicians is
tremendously impressive, and
makes the climax of the evening
that much more exhilarating.
The standing ovation was
immediate and long, and the
audience left the auditorium
slowly. Three hours in the
presence of one of the world's
absolute musical geniuses left
some giddy, some tranquil, some
silent, and probably left all
grasping for some way to define
the excellence they had just
heard.

Auditorium drifts up from the
incense burning within a golden
circle of light at center stage.
As one member of the
audience said after Ravi Shankar's
performance, "He demands
attention, and he gets it."
It is difficult to imagine Ravi
Shankar demanding attention or
anything else. Preceded by his two
accompanists — if tabla master
Alia Rakha can be called such a
thing — Shankar walks quietly
onto the stage dressed in white
except for a dark vest.
Daisies, Roses
Bowing to his audience,
Shankar sits crosslegged between
his fellow musicians on an Indian
carpet. In front of the carpet are
daisies, roses, and one fresh
pineapple that members of the
audience have brought for the
master.
Shankar explains that the first

raga is a late evening raga with a
seven beat tala, or rhythmic cycle,
divided three-two-two.
As a description of what is to
follow, Shankar's words are as
effective as trying to describe
color to a blind man. The music
must be heard.
The lyric prelude of the raga,
the alap, combines rapid melodies
from Shankar's sitar with the
hypnotic drone of the tamboura,
a four-stringed background
instrument. The inter-twining,
slow, invocative beginning gains
speed, and crescendoes toward the
gat, the rhythmic second section
of the raga.
Rakha Bored
Throughout the a alap Alia
Rakha looks bored, sitting behind
the tabla, two drums tuned to a
tonic, dominant, or sub-dominant
and a bass tone. As he awaits his
entrance, Rakha tunes the
higher-pitched drum with a small
hammer.
Rakha and Shankar begin a
disagreement over when Rakha
should enter the raga. Shankar
builds to crescendo, glances
sideways at Rakha, who taps his
drums once or twice and then
stops. Shankar pounds his foot on

the floor in anticipation, yet
Rakha waits.
Throughout the evening, the
two masters attempt to trick each
other, playing an elaborate
musical game. Shankar plays a
pattern which he dares Rakha to
duplicate on the tabla, and Rakha
follows effortlessly. Like the very
best of jazz musicians, the two
improvise as though they have
only one mind.
Shankar and Rakha finally
combine on the gat, and build to
an overwhelming climax which
brings thunderous applause from
the audience. The applause seems
even louder because it begins so
suddenly and spontaneously,
shattering the silence following
the last note.
Spring Festival
The second raga is Raga
Mishrakafi, dedicated to the
Indian spring festival which
commemorates an evening 5000
years ago when Lord Krishna
made love to 10,000 lovely
milkmaids by the light of the lull
moon. This raga is amazingly
happy with a certain soaring
loveliness.
The second half of the program
begins with an amazing tabla solo
by Rakha in jhaptala, or a
two-five-two-five 10 beat cycle,
Shankar claps out and explains
the rhythm to the audience.

pounding his foot on the floor to
emphasize the sum, the first beat
of each cycle.
Rakha, aside from being
perhaps the world's foremost
tabla player, is probably Indian
music's foremost ham. He first
sings a rhythmic section, gesturing
to Shankar as if to say, "You just
think I can't play that." Rakha
then proceeds to duplicate both in
rhythm and tone what he has
sung. It is an amazing
demonstration of both the
instrument and the musician.
Rakha leaves the stage as
Shankar explains that the next
raga came to him as an inspiration
as he was traveling to the grave of
his guru for a memorial
celebration. It is the first public
performance of the piece.
Dark, Foreboding
Without the rhythmic
accompaniment of the tabla,
Shankar demonstrates his solo
playing in a three section raga
which communicates both dark,
foreboding longing and a flight of
the soul. Interlaced between the
two moods are moments of
profound peace.
The final notes of the raga fade
slowly, and the audience
maintains the silence Shankar has
asked for to follow his tribute.
The final raga is a dhun, an air
or melody from Indian folk music

put into classical style. Shankar's
dhun floats gracefully and leaves
the audience high. After the
darkness of the preceding piece,
the feeling is welcome.
Toward the end of the gat,
Shankar and Rakha trade solos.
Shankar first plays a rapid
sequence on the si tar, and Rakha
follows with a near imitation on
the tabla. This rapid crossfire
between the two musicians is
tremendously impressive, and
makes the climax of the evening
that much more exhilarating.
The standing ovation was
immediate and long, and the
audience left the auditorium
slowly. Three hours in the
presence of one of the world's
absolute musical geniuses left
some giddy, some tranquil, some
silent, and probably left all
grasping for some way to define
the excellence they had just
heard.
SAN FRANCISCO - "Mr.
Shankar has requested that there
be no smoking, no picture taking,
and no sound recording during the
performance."
