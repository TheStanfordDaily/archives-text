# Seven File For House Seat
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Four Democrats and three
Republicans have filed to run in the
June 4 primary in the newly created
12th Congressional District.
The 12th District, which includes
Stanford, consists largely of the same
area that previously was included in
the 17th District.
Candidates for the Democratic
nomination are Gary Gillmor, Herbert
Rhodes, Thomas Skornia and
Lawrence L. Spitter. The Republican
candidates are Paul McCloskey,
congressman for the 17th District,
John Fredrich and J. Gordon Knapp.
"It looks as if it will be a close
campaign for the Republican
nomination," McCloskey stated.
Noting that he received only 43
percent of the vote in the 1972
Republican primary, McCloskey
explained that he won the nomination
because the majority was split between
two conservative candidates.
Chris Hocker, press
secretary for Knapp, agreed that the
race for the GOP nomination would be

close. But he expressed the belief that
Knapp is likely to unite conservative
voters to defeat McCloskey. '
Youth Support
McCloskey explained that although
he enjoys overwhelming support
among young voters, most of them are
registered as Democrats and thus
cannot vote for him in the primary.
Although McCloskey disassociated
himself from the Nixon
Administration several years ago, he
predicted that Watergate will hurt all
incumbents.
"Watergate has grown to the point
where many voters don't want to
reelect anyone," he said. "The effect
on the Republican candidates has been
incredible. Voters are disgusted with
Watergate and in recent congressional
elections in state after state the
message has come through like a
blockbuster.
But as a result of this, the next
Congress will consist of a better group
of people, even though some of us
may get washed out."

Anti-Nixon
Hocker predicted that McCloskey's
anti-Nixon views will hurt him in the
primary. "Most Republican voters are
still loyal to Nixon," Hocker stated.
Knapp, a Peninsula businessman, is
stressing the need for a reduction in
federal spending, according to Hocker.
If elected, Knapp would attempt to
maximize the efficiency of
government spending in an effort to
reduce inflation, Hocker said.
Both McCloskey and Knapp agree
on the need for a balanced budget as a
means of reducing government
spending. "Big deficits are the primary

cause of inflation," McCloskey said.
Fredrick, an unemployed Palo Alto
carpenter, is emphasizing the need to
reduce the nation's defense budget.
Frederick filed claims that he could
not afford to pay the $425 filing fee.
In order to get his name on the ballot,
he was forced to swear a pauper's
oath.
Inflation and Integrity
In the Democratic race, the
candidates generally agree that
inflation and the lack of integrity
among government officials are the
leading issues in the campaign.
Rhodes, an employment
representative at the University,
advocates a balanced budget, and
claims that he could represent the
working people of the district because
he is one of them.
"The people of the middle and
lower income brackets are being
squeezed by unethical corporations,"
Rhodes said. "I understand these
frustrations because I have to live with
them also."
Not An Inventory
Rhodes remarked that people want
a representive who "won't store
consituents as inventory for the next
election."
Skornia stated that he is stressing
the need for public financing of

political campaigns in his campaign.
He is also emphasizing the need for
solution to the problems of energy and
the economy, and is a proponent of
equal rights for women.
Skornia stated that the electorate is
seeking men of high integrity this year.
Although he called McCloskey a man
"of pristine image" whose "integrity
is obvious," Skornia emphasized that
it is all the more important for the
Democrats to run a man whose honesty
is unquestioned.
If Skornia is nominated, he said he
looks forward to a campaign in which
both candidates engage in serious
discussion of issues rather than in
attempts to question the integrity of
each other.
Gillmor, mayor of Santa Clara, is
emphasizing the need of the 12th
District for a congressman who will
grapple with the problems of the area.
Spitters is a Palo Alto businessman
and the co-founder of Memorex
Corporation. He could not be reached
for comment.
In addition to the University, the
12th District includes Palo Alto, East
Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Los Altos, Los
Altos Hills, Santa Clara, Mountain
View, and part of Redwood City. The
largest city in the district is Sunnyvale,
a suburban community with a
population of approximately 100,000.
