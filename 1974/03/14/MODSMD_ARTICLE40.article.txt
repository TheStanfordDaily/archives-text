# All-Junipero Cast, Crew
## House Sparkles In 'Li'l Abner' 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
In this age of overnight waits
for gasoline, it's great to find
entertainment in your own
backyard. And when the
entertainment is an excellent
musical production done by a
group of happy and enthusiastic
amateurs, the result can be
fantastic.
And if the admission is free —
but the truth is that Junipero
House could have charged
admission for its production of
Li'l Abner last Saturday, because
director Susie Malouf brought
together a group of amateurs from
a single dorm and turned out a
professional production.
Rick Everist starred as the
adorable and eternal bachelor
Abner Yokum, pursued by Sue
Stanaway as the lovely Daisy Mae.
Stanaway's soprano voice was the
only truly professional sound in
the cast, yet she managed to
escape the image of prima donna
amid amateurs that can destroy
small productions.
Pouting, Shouting
Stanaway not only sang well,
but her acting was excellent. Her
flirtations with Abner and her
pouting and shouting spells were
all convincing and — if this isn't
too corny a term — rather
endearing.
Everist has an incredible boyish
charm and good looks that made
his role as Abner the type-cast of
the century. Although his singing
wasn't operatic, it was perfect for
his part. His acting, particularly in
his scene facing the president and
his scenes alone with Daisy Mae,
was very good.
Everist combined with
Marryin' Sam (Jeff Ogden) for
one of the musical highlights of
the show, "The Country's In The
Very Best Of Hands." This song
was altered to include two
Watergate verses that delighted
the audience, and Everist and
Ogden delivered the song with
style.
Arch-Matriarch
Jan Grassmuck was the
character actor of the show with
her amusing portrayal of
arch-matriarch Mammy Yokum.
Delivering lines and then stuffing
her pipe in her mouth for
punctuation, Grassmuck's
physical comedy was superb.
After Grassmuck dominated
the meek and mild-mannered
Pappy Yokum (Ted Ong) through
most of the play, the pair brought
cheers and wild applause from
males in the audience as Pappy

took charge of things in the next
to last scene and dragged Mammy
off stage by an ear.
Other notable characters in the
production were Rick Katz as the
hard-hearted scientist Dr.
Finsdale; Don Lum as the
combination Lon Chaney-Peter
Lorre hunchback Dr. Smithborn;
and Barb Hoey as general's
girlfriend Appasionata.
Half-Truth Whammy
Whammy wizard Evil Eyed
Fleagle was played perfectly by
Bob Hay man, who bounced
around the stage energetically and
eyed Appasionata constantly.
Asked by the evil General
Bullmoose (Bill Wernecke) if there
was such a thing as a half-truth
whammy, Fleagle replied cooly,

"Sure. It's very big in
Washington."
Wernecke's B id l moose and
John Goepp as Senator Jack S.
Phogbound were both excellent;
Wernecke as a power hung*y
member of the military
establishment, and Goepp as his
congressional lackey were amiable
if misguided villians.
The mock-villian Earthquake
McGoon played by Jeff Prater was
powerful yet smooth, and
ultimately too likeable to be any
kind of true villian.
Lively Chorus Dancers
Outstanding individual
performances in even the smallest
roles were combined with lively
choral and dance numbers which
showed the enthusiasm the

members of Junipero felt for this
project. The "Jubilation T.
Cornpone" production number
was especially lively, and the girls
in "Put 'em Back" were very
good.
It's always most enjoyable to
watch a production in which the
cast enjoys what it does as much
as the audience does. Junipero
House is to be congratulated for
giving their audience a chance to
share in their fun.

BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE?—Appassionata Von Climax is
threatened with a return to her old line of work "scooping those 31
flavors" if she fails to ensnare the innocent and totally unwilling
Abner Yokum in Junipero's production of Li'l Abner. Barb Hoey in
her role as the sultry Appassionata gained approving glances from
many men in the audience, as well as hisses from some of the females.

Stanaway's soprano voice was the
only truly professional sound in
the cast, yet she managed to
escape the image of prima donna
amid amateurs that can destroy
small productions.
Pouting, Shouting
Stanaway not only sang well,
but her acting was excellent. Her
flirtations with Abner and her
pouting and shouting spells were
all convincing and — if this isn't
too corny a term — rather
endearing.
Everist has an incredible boyish
charm and good looks that made
his role as Abner the type-cast of
the century. Although his singing
wasn't operatic, it was perfect for
his part. His acting, particularly in
his scene facing the president and
his scenes alone with Daisy Mae,
was very good.
Everist combined with
Marryin' Sam (Jeff Ogden) for
one of the musical highlights of
the show, "The Country's In The
Very Best Of Hands." This song
was altered to include two
Watergate verses that delighted
the audience, and Everist and
Ogden delivered the song with
style.
Arch-Matriarch
Jan Grassmuck was the
character actor of the show with
her amusing portrayal of
arch-matriarch Mammy Yokum.
Delivering lines and then stuffing
her pipe in her mouth for
punctuation, Grassmuck's
physical comedy was superb.
After Grassmuck dominated
the meek and mild-mannered
Pappy Yokum (Ted Ong) through
most of the play, the pair brought
cheers and wild applause from
males in the audience as Pappy

took charge of things in the next
to last scene and dragged Mammy
off stage by an ear.
Other notable characters in the
production were Rick Katz as the
hard-hearted scientist Dr.
Finsdale; Don Lum as the
combination Lon Chaney-Peter
Lorre hunchback Dr. Smithborn;
and Barb Hoey as general's
girlfriend Appasionata.
Half-Truth Whammy
Whammy wizard Evil Eyed
Fleagle was played perfectly by
Bob Hay man, who bounced
around the stage energetically and
eyed Appasionata constantly.
Asked by the evil General
Bullmoose (Bill Wernecke) if there
was such a thing as a half-truth
whammy, Fleagle replied cooly,

"Sure. It's very big in
Washington."
Wernecke's B id l moose and
John Goepp as Senator Jack S.
Phogbound were both excellent;
Wernecke as a power hung*y
member of the military
establishment, and Goepp as his
congressional lackey were amiable
if misguided villians.
The mock-villian Earthquake
McGoon played by Jeff Prater was
powerful yet smooth, and
ultimately too likeable to be any
kind of true villian.
Lively Chorus Dancers
Outstanding individual
performances in even the smallest
roles were combined with lively
choral and dance numbers which
showed the enthusiasm the

members of Junipero felt for this
project. The "Jubilation T.
Cornpone" production number
was especially lively, and the girls
in "Put 'em Back" were very
good.
It's always most enjoyable to
watch a production in which the
cast enjoys what it does as much
as the audience does. Junipero
House is to be congratulated for
giving their audience a chance to
share in their fun.

BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE?—Appassionata Von Climax is
threatened with a return to her old line of work "scooping those 31
flavors" if she fails to ensnare the innocent and totally unwilling
Abner Yokum in Junipero's production of Li'l Abner. Barb Hoey in
her role as the sultry Appassionata gained approving glances from
many men in the audience, as well as hisses from some of the females.
In this age of overnight waits

House could have charged
admission for its production of
Li'l Abner last Saturday, because
director Susie Malouf brought
