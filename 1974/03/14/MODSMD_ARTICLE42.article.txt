# Boz Scaggs Hits Oakland In Tuxedo
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
OAKLAND — As a concert, it
was successful. As an indication of
social trends, it was hard to
explain. Whatever it was, the
appearance of Boz Scaggs and his
orchestra Friday at Oakland's
Paramount Theatre of the Arts
was perhaps the first of its kind —
a black-tie rock concert.
The fun began, of course, long
before a note was heard. All sorts
of freaks in varying degrees of
formal wear (everything from
suits to dinner jackets to top hats
and tails) strutted for one another

and the occasional older members
of the opening-night audience.
(An interesting observation: with
only a few noticeable exceptions,
the men definitely out-dressed the
women.)
The Art-Deco surroundings of
the Paramount were the ideal
setting for everyone's flight of
elegant if slightly decadent fancy.
Tuxedoed Boz
Oh yes, the music. The curtain
rose on a rock band fronting
generous string, reed and horn
sections, all in concert dress. Then
a tuxedoed Boz Scaggs strode to

the center-stage microphone,
strapped on his guitar and began
with "Now That I've Found
You," complete with three female
backup singers.
This and the next number,
"Just Don't Want To Be Lonely,"
generally set the pace for the
evening: tight ensemble playing
with luxurious orchestral backup,
always highlighting Boz' voice.
"Runnin' Blues," with Box
playing some nice blues lead
guitar, was a bit looser, sounding
more like a rock band. One of the
evening's best rocking tunes,
"Monkey Time," featured Les
Dudeck on slide guitar. A popular
rock critic to the contrary, he
does not sound enough like the
late Duane Allman to be his ghost,
but he is awfully good. The
general careful orchestration of
the concert didn't allow him as
much space as he obviously could
have filled.
Dudeck Young
Dudeck and Joachim Young on
keyboards did an excellent job
providing the fill-ins and
embellishments which can
complement a singer so well.
The first set concluded with
a couple of old Box Scaggs
standbys, "Might Have To Cry"
and "Dinah Flo." Again, the

emphasis was on the singing, with
band, orchestra and singers geared
toward making the song effective.
Boz returned for the second set
in a red velvet jacket and an
open-necked shirt, and spoke to
the audience for the first time. He
explained that he would be
introducing several songs from his
new album Slow Dancer, and that
he wanted to produce on stage
"the same concept" as on the
album.
Indeed, the concert had the
feel and sound of a well-produced
— perhaps a bit over-produced —
record, which is consistent with
his earlier works. Often the sound
was reminiscent of Motown
arrangements, especially on
"Angel Lady" and "There Is
Someone Else In My Life."
Still Rock
Some of the new tunes rock
with the best of the old ones, too.
"Let it Happen" featured some
fine Dixie guitar from Dudeck,
and "Hercules" reminded
everyone that this was a rock
concert.
The finale, "I'll Be Long
Gone," was a good rendition of
one of Boz' better tunes. Many in
the crowd called for "Loan Me A
Dime" as an encore, but instead,
Boz introduced Johnny Bristol,

producer of the new album, and
together they sang the latter's "I
Got Your Number." The two
obviously enjoy the song, for they
went through it at least twice.
Then, with the band and orchestra
keeping up the background riff,
they departed up the center aisle
of the auditorium.
Without the bow ties, velvet
seats and champagne down at the
bar, the concert might have been
less than successful. Rather than
adding to it, the formal air seemed
to substitute for some of the sheer
excitement of a genuine rock
concert. Bill Graham has
tentatively scheduled two more
black-tie concerts: the Pointer
Sisters in April at the Opera
House, perhaps with the San
Francisco Symphony; and back at
the Paramount in May, Graham
Nash "and some of his friends."
