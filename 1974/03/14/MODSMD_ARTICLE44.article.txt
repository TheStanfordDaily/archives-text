# Spring Opera Revives 'L'Ormindo'
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
SAN FRANCISCO - Though
the Opera House was dark on
Friday night due to the city
employees' strike, the Spring
Opera Theater was holding forth
uptown in the Curran with a
colorful and lively production of
Francesco Cavalli's L'Ormindo.
Though first performed in
1644 and promptly forgotten
thereafter, the work — performed
in the realization by Raymond
Leppard with an effective English
translation by Geoffrey Dunn — is
no relic. Rather it is a convincing
and engaging comedy, welcome in
the tired repertoire of operatic
reruns.
The plot centers on an eternal
triangle between Erisbe, Queen of
Morrocco, and her two suitors,
the Princes Ormindo and Amida.
This takes on further geometrical
dimensions with the addition of
King Ariadeno, her aging husband,
and the disguised return of
Princess Side, Amida's jilted
lover.
Tragic Poisoning
Add to this an entourage of
courtly attendants, each with an
opinion on the state of love, and a
tragic poisoning of hero and
heroine (yes, it takes them just as
long to die as it does in operas
two hundred years later!), and
figure out the rest.
The opera gains substance
dramatically from the sharp
contrast of mood between the
brilliant and vivacious first act and
the pathos of Act 11. The arias are
short and abound with beautiful
melodies. The tyranny of the da
capo which immobilized opera
scria of subsequent generations
has not yet taken hold, allowing a
brisk pace and great variety
characterization.

Grayson Hirst sang the title
role in a smooth, lyric tenor
providing the most poignant
moment of the performance in
the aria, "Lament, ye cupids" in
the second act. Barbara Hendricks
as Queen Erisbe was a beautiful
match, singing with clarity and
control.
Sumptuous Duet
Mezzo Maria Eqing was
distinguished both dramatically
and vocally as Princess Side,
singing a sumptuous duet with
baritone Stephen Mosel (Amida)
on their reunited love.
Philip Booth played the elderly
king with hilarious pomposity, his
lustrous bass compensating for
some dramatic excesses. He saved
the role from the ridiculous,
however, by a touching and
sympathetic performance in Act
11.
Of the buffo characters, Orva
Hoskinson carried on in the
transvestite role of Erice, Side's
old nurse, with style that would
shame Charles Pierce. His antics
are a credit to his longtime
association with Gilbert and
Sullivan productions.
Clear Diction
Filling out the consistently fine
cast were Donna Petersen as
Melide, Gwendolyn Jones as
Mirinda, John Miller as Osmano,
and Janice Felty as Nerillo.
The problems of performing a
seventeenth century Venetian
opera are myriad, but the
production by Bill Francisco kept
the stage active without the
mechanical contrivances for which
its historical antecedents were
famous.
Conductor Andrew Metzler
kept rhythmic vitality throughout
the ensemble, which — though
lacking woodwinds saved the

baroque organ continuo —
included harp, guitar, two lutes,
theorbo, and two harpsichords in
addition to a considerable string
complement. Most objectionalbe
is the harp, which in dominating
the other plucked instruments,
lends an unwanted touch of
Ravel.Only the recitatives seemed
encumbered by the orchestration.

hindering the singers in the free
declamation of their lines.
Nonetheless, this production
has rejuvenated a forgotten work
with energy and vitality as a
worthy contribution to the
modern opera repertoire, not as
an antique stuffed and mounted.
One performance remains,
Saturday March 16, at 8 p.m.
