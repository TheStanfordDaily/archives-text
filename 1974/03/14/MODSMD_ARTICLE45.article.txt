# Salgo Directs 'Ninth'
## 
### DOUG ARCHERD 
The Stanford Symphony
Orchestra, the Memorial Church
Choir, the University Chorus, and
the Stanford Chorale combined to
give a dramatic and polished
performance of two works of
Beethoven Sunday.
The Founders' Day program
held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
was directed by Stanford
Symphony Conductor Sandor
Salgo. The works were the
"Fantasy" Opus 80, with the
Ninth Symphony following as the
main work.
Choral director Harold
Schmidt provided nearly every
singer in the University to ensure
enough fullness and volume for
the Ninth Symphony's choral
section in the final movement.
Powerful Voices
There were so many people on
the stage once both the orchestra
and the chorus had assembled that
some singers were very nearly lost
in the wings of the not overlarge
Dinkelspiel stage. The huge throng
achieved its purpose, though, for
the voices came through
powerfully yet well balanced with
the orchestra.
The soloists were for the most
part up to the task as well, with
an especially fine opening
recitative by bass Marc Clemens.
All in all, the vocal work was
quite impressive.
The orchestra, while it shone
brilliantly throughout most of the
performance, had some weak
moments, though these may have
been accented by the otherwise
outstanding quality.
Polished, Professional
Particularly in the first and
fourth movements of the 9th,
they produced a polished,
professional sound which was

pleasantly surprising to one used
to the usual quality of college
orchestras.
The second movement, the
faster scherzo of the 9th, was also
quite clear and precise, though
only after a somewhat shaky start.
The third movement was
plainly disappointing, especially in
light of the quality before and
after, for the normally excellent
strings simply were not really
together throughout most of the
movement.
Looking Forward
The third is the slow, tranquil
movement, and there are very few
fast passages which compare with
the difficulty of those in the first
or second movements. The only
explanation which one could
hazard is that the orchestra was
already looking forward to the
fourth movement and simply lost
concentration.
By the end of the fourth
movement, though, the orchestra
definitely thrust aside any
criticisms in the audiences mind.
While there were some very shaky
points in this movement as well,
the sheer drama and power of a
stage full of people singing and
playing what is indisputably one
of the finest pieces of music ever
composed brought the audience
to its feet at the end for a great
deal of genuine and well deserved
applause.
Even the faults with the fourth
movement seem to have been due
to the musicians own enthusiasm.
Twice the orchestra started to run
away with the tempo, but Salgo
was able to keep it within bounds
both times. Salgo did a fine job of
coordinating the huge crowd of
performers, and his silver hair
flying about under the spotlight
did nothing to detract from the

tire and drama ot Beethoven.
Nicely Performed
The Fantasy, while it is not the
absolute masterpiece the 9th is,
was very nicely performed, and
gave an opportunity for some very
good performances. The work is
divided into an adagio for piano,
which featured Helen Wickett,
and a finale for piano, orchestra,
and chorus, which featured the
Stanford Chorale, together with
some members of the Chorus.
Wickett possesses a sensitive,
delicate touch which was a delight
to hear. Possibly because of the
flat acoustics of the hall,
compounded by nearly
wall-to-wall people, the louder
sections lacked power, though,
which was unfortunate for she is
otherwise an excellent pianist.
The entrance of the orchestra
pinpointed the woodwinds, which
were superb throughout the whole
performance. The Chorale is also
certainly worthy of notice,
though the orchestra was a bit
overpowering.
High Quality
All in all, the quality of both
works was high, and both Salgo
and Schmidt may take great pride
in their achievement. The
audience, of its part, was party to
a dramatically moving experience.
It is a pleasure indeed when a
work as powerful and
awe-inspiring as the Ninth
Symphony can be performed with
such drama, precision, and
sensitivity.

applause.

movement seem to have been due
to the musicians own enthusiasm.
Twice the orchestra started to run
away with the tempo, but Salgo
was able to keep it within bounds
both times. Salgo did a fine job of
coordinating the huge crowd of
performers, and his silver hair
flying about under the spotlight
did nothing to detract from the

tire and drama ot Beethoven.
Nicely Performed
The Fantasy, while it is not the
absolute masterpiece the 9th is,
was very nicely performed, and
gave an opportunity for some very
good performances. The work is
divided into an adagio for piano,
which featured Helen Wickett,
and a finale for piano, orchestra,
and chorus, which featured the
Stanford Chorale, together with
some members of the Chorus.
Wickett possesses a sensitive,
delicate touch which was a delight
to hear. Possibly because of the
flat acoustics of the hall,
compounded by nearly
wall-to-wall people, the louder
sections lacked power, though,
which was unfortunate for she is
otherwise an excellent pianist.
The entrance of the orchestra
pinpointed the woodwinds, which
were superb throughout the whole
performance. The Chorale is also
certainly worthy of notice,
though the orchestra was a bit
overpowering.
High Quality
All in all, the quality of both
works was high, and both Salgo
and Schmidt may take great pride
in their achievement. The
audience, of its part, was party to
a dramatically moving experience.
It is a pleasure indeed when a
work as powerful and
awe-inspiring as the Ninth
Symphony can be performed with
such drama, precision, and
sensitivity.
The Stanford Symphony
Orchestra, the Memorial Church
Choir, the University Chorus, and
the Stanford Chorale combined to
give a dramatic and polished
performance of two works of
Beethoven Sunday.
The Founders' Day program
held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
was directed by Stanford
Symphony Conductor Sandor
Salgo. The works were the
"Fantasy" Opus 80, with the
Ninth Symphony following as the
main work.
Choral director Harold
Schmidt provided nearly every
singer in the University to ensure
enough fullness and volume for
the Ninth Symphony's choral
section in the final movement.
Powerful Voices
There were so many people on
the stage once both the orchestra
and the chorus had assembled that
some singers were very nearly lost
in the wings of the not overlarge
Dinkelspiel stage. The huge throng
achieved its purpose, though, for
the voices came through
powerfully yet well balanced with
the orchestra.
The soloists were for the most
part up to the task as well, with
an especially fine opening
recitative by bass Marc Clemens.
All in all, the vocal work was
quite impressive.
The orchestra, while it shone
brilliantly throughout most of the
performance, had some weak
moments, though these may have
been accented by the otherwise
outstanding quality.
Polished, Professional
Particularly in the first and
fourth movements of the 9th,
they produced a polished,
professional sound which was

pleasantly surprising to one used
to the usual quality of college
orchestras.
The second movement, the
faster scherzo of the 9th, was also
quite clear and precise, though
only after a somewhat shaky start.
The third movement was
plainly disappointing, especially in
light of the quality before and
after, for the normally excellent
strings simply were not really
together throughout most of the
movement.
Looking Forward
The third is the slow, tranquil
movement, and there are very few
fast passages which compare with
the difficulty of those in the first
or second movements. The only
explanation which one could
hazard is that the orchestra was
already looking forward to the
fourth movement and simply lost
concentration.
By the end of the fourth
movement, though, the orchestra
definitely thrust aside any
criticisms in the audiences mind.
While there were some very shaky
points in this movement as well,
the sheer drama and power of a
stage full of people singing and
playing what is indisputably one
of the finest pieces of music ever
composed brought the audience
to its feet at the end for a great

applause.
