# Kelley-Walton: The Last Battle
## 
### 
During the 1974-75 Pacific Eight basketball season, the heavy
burden of Bill Walton will finally be lifted from the shoulders of
Stanford's Rich Kelley.
In his three-year career at UCLA, Walton set four Pac-8
records. As a sophomore he established single season marks in
total rebounds (239) and rebounding average (17.1). This year he
cracked the single season field goal percentage record, hitting
69.4 percent of his shots. His fourth mark is career rebounding
average (16.0).
Walton collected 640 rebounds in 40 career conference games,
missing the Pac-8 record of 646 set by Doug Smart of Washington
in 1957-59. His career field goal percentage of 64.1 percent fell
barely short of the 64.2 mark set by Lew Alcindor (now Karcem
Abdul-Jabbar) of UCLA in 1967-69.
Compiling those amazing statistics seemed effortless for
Walton except in his battles with Kelley. Stanford's talented
junior center twice joined Walton on the All-Conference team,
and the two seven-footers have engaged in several classic duels,
including the March 2 game at Maples Pavilion pictured on this
page.
"Outside of Walton, Kelley's the best player on the Coast,"
Washington coach Marv Harshman has often said. Next year,
Kelley may simply be the best.
