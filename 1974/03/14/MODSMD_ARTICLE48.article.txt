# Narrow Loss To Cal Caps Season Of Frustration
## Kelley's Heroics Wasted As Bears Upset Cards 
### STAN WILSON 
BERKELEY—For seniors Jim
Montague and Mike Mann it was a
frustrating end. Coach Howie
Dallmar hopes that for his 10
returning cagers it was an end to
the frustration.
The game was a disappointing
finale to a dismal conference
season, which began with four
straight losses and ended the same
way. It didn't seem to matter that
those last four losses were by a
total of only nine points.
Few found comfort in the
knowledge that the tall Cards
would have all five starters back
next year. Five starters returned
this season—from a team which
finished 14-11, the first winning
record in five years of Stanford
basketball. And with wins in four
of its last five games a year ago,
things promised to get even
better.
They didn't. Three free throws
in the last minute by California
guard Brady Allen insured the
final loss for Stanford, and
flip-flopped the Cardinal record to
11-14. A driving lay-in by junior
guard Melvin Arterberry closed
the margin to 71-68, but with
only three seconds on the clock
the vocal Harmon Gymnasium
crowd celebrated Cal's third Pac-8
victory. Most importantly, the
cellar-dwelling Bears had salvaged
a bit of pride.
"Stanford was kind of cold,"
explained Allen. "They didn't
look like they were up for the
game. We battled hard. We wanted
to show we could do it."
The Cards were definitely cold,
but dependable Rich Kelley, and

Arterberry, who has shown
remarkable improvement in his
offensive play, carried the load as
they have for most of Stanford's
last half-dozen games.
Kelley, who usually devastates
Cal single-handedly, almost did it
again. Stanford's junior center
scored a game-high 29 points,
grabbed 17 rebounds, contributed
four assists and rejected five field
goal attempts. Arterberry chipped
in 17 points and nine rebounds,
but their efforts weren't enough.
"We had a bad spell the last
five minutes of the first half,"
Dallmar understated. The Cards,
with the exception of Arterberry
and Kelley, shot a microscopic
1-19 in the first period.
The Bears scored the last six
points of the half, but led only
35-26 at the intermission.
Stanford came back, and actually
led 60-58 on an assist by Mark
Gilberg and a fadeaway jumper by
Tim Patterson with 5:31
remaining. Cal's Carl Meier tied
the game with a 14-footer, and
overrated sophomore Rickie
Hawthorne, who had allowed the
Cards to get back in the game
with his poor shot selection,
finally canned*u 22-footer for the
go-ahead bucket. A steal and a
pair of free throws by Allen gave
the Bears some breathing room.
"I'm tickled for the kids," said
jubilant Cal coach Dick Edwards.
"They never quit—they've had so
many frustrations."
And Edwards praised the
performances of Meier and Allen,
whose parents were given flowers
and introduced at the beginning
of the game along with the other
graduating Bear seniors.
"Ain't that a way to go out?"
Edwards exclaimed. "We're gonna
miss them both." Meier finished
the game with 20 points and 15
rebounds, while Allen led Cal
scorers with 22 points.

Cardinal Notes: According to
Daily fashion editor Nancy Ditz,
Billy Jones overwhelmed Bub
Bowling, 7-4, in the Second
Annual Coaches Dressing
Competition. Head Coach Howie
Dallmar and freshman assistant
Bob Buell finished in a scoreless
tie for last. Bowling, who won last
year's contest by a narrow margin,
was unavailable for
comment... On the basketball
scene, it is worthwhile to note
that Arterberry, who was 4-18 in
his first two games this season,
finished eighth in the Pac-8 in
field goal percentage at .524. The
soft-spoken junior averaged 14.6
points per game in his last six
conference games, and finished as
the team's number-three
rebounder with 118(4.7 per game
average). More importantly,
Arterberry edged Patterson by
two caroms in their personal
rebounding duel (although he
played in one more game) ...
Kelley, with 892 points in two
years of varsity basketball,
currently ranks 15tli on the list of
all-time Stanford scorers.

TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE-Rich Kelley, who committed a good
number of fouls this year but was charged with several he didn't
deserve, reluctantly raises his hand and offers the ball to referee
Booker Turner. Kelley fouled out nine times this season, often
languishing on the bench during the waning moments of tight games.

IN THE THICK OF THINGS—One of the bright spots in a dismal season was the aggressive play of
sophomore forward Ed Schweitzer. 'Easy Eddie, shown here sandwiched between USC's Bob Trowbridge
(left) and John Lambert, averaged 12.0 points and 7.8 rebounds per game.
