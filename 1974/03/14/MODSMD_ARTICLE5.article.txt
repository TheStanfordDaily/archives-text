# 'Had Enough War,' Arab Diplomat Says
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
"We have not been afraid to face
the Israelis on the battlefield, and we
are not afraid to face them at the
conference table; but we have had
enough of war," said Egyptian
Ambassador to the United States
Ashraf Ghorbal before a crowd of 200
in Tresidder lounge Tuesday night.
The ambassador outlined three
conditions for a permanent peace:
total Israeli withdrawal from all
occupied Arab lands, an independent
state for the Palestinian refugees and
existence for the state of Israel.
"There can be no peace in the
Middle East without the Palestinians
taking part in the agreement," stated
Ghorbal. "No one can speak for the
Palestinians but their own elected
representatives, who must take part in
the Geneva Convention if it is to
produce a just settlement.
Policy Toward Israel
"We are not anxious to wither away
the state of Israel," he continued. "No
one would allow us to do this even if
we wanted — not the Soviets, not the
U.S."
Ghorbal, appointed last year as
Egypt's first ambassador to the U.S.
since the 1967 Six-Day War,
emphasized the need for "positiveness
and constructiveness" in U.S.-Egyptian
relations.
"We could never allow ourselves to
become a satellite of the U.S., just as
we never allowed the Soviets to
dominate our policy. I think the U.S.
government realizes our position now
and understands that we have no
designs to crush Israel," he said.
Turning to the oil crisis, Ghorbal
declared, "The Arab embargo may be
an annoyance to some, but perhaps it
has saved many lives. We knew that we
had to use all the means in our power

to regain our occupied territority; we
showed the world that the Arab
nations have powerful economic cards
to play."
Ghorbal spoke a day before Arab
countries announced they had lifted
the embargo.
Second Thoughts
"I think the Israeli leadership now
has second thoughts about their policy
of occupation," he added. "In the
years after the 1967 war they sold
themselves the idea that their security
relied on holding Arab territory, in the
Sinai, the Golan Heights and
elsewhere.
"In 1971 they rejected a peace
settlement in exchange for the
territory, but in October last year they
learned the hard way that their
position was unjust," he noted.
Noting that the Suez Canal would
soon be opened, Ghorbal said, "As
long as Israel holds our territory or
that of any Arab state, and as long as
there is no Palestinian state, we could
not allow Israeli ships to pass through
the canal. Only when there is lasting
peace can we allow the Israeli flag to
fly there."
Ghorbal cited recent instability in
the Israeli government as a sign that
"things have changed." He stated,
"People used to say that the Arabs
were hopelessly disorganized, but now
the tables are turned. Today the Arab
nations are firmly united, and we
cannot allow the internal squabbles of
Israel to interfere with the Geneva
peace talks. Those problems aren't our
fault."
"We Arabs aren't as sophisticated as
the Israelis in the business of public
relations and propaganda," he added.
"But we say, Met the facts speak for
themselves.' We are gaining the
approval of world opinion."

"things have changed." He stated,
"People used to say that the Arabs
were hopelessly disorganized, but now
the tables are turned. Today the Arab
nations are firmly united, and we
cannot allow the internal squabbles of
Israel to interfere with the Geneva
peace talks. Those problems aren't our
fault."
"We Arabs aren't as sophisticated as
the Israelis in the business of public
relations and propaganda," he added.
"But we say, Met the facts speak for
themselves.' We are gaining the
approval of world opinion."

OIL DIPLOMACY — Egyptian Ambassador to the United States Ashraf Ghorbal
outlined his country's requirements for a permanent peace in a speech here
Tuesday. Ghorbal listed three conditions: total Israeli withdrawal from occupied
Arab lands, an independent state for the Palestinian refugees and existence for
the state of Israel.
"We have not been afraid to face
the Israelis on the battlefield, and we
are not afraid to face them at the
conference table; but we have had
enough of war," said Egyptian
Ambassador to the United States
Ashraf Ghorbal before a crowd of 200
in Tresidder lounge Tuesday night.
The ambassador outlined three
conditions for a permanent peace:
total Israeli withdrawal from all
occupied Arab lands, an independent
state for the Palestinian refugees and
existence for the state of Israel.
"There can be no peace in the
Middle East without the Palestinians
taking part in the agreement," stated
Ghorbal. "No one can speak for the
Palestinians but their own elected
representatives, who must take part in
the Geneva Convention if it is to
produce a just settlement.
Policy Toward Israel
"We are not anxious to wither away
the state of Israel," he continued. "No
one would allow us to do this even if
we wanted — not the Soviets, not the
U.S."
Ghorbal, appointed last year as
Egypt's first ambassador to the U.S.
since the 1967 Six-Day War,
emphasized the need for "positiveness
and constructiveness" in U.S.-Egyptian
relations.
"We could never allow ourselves to
become a satellite of the U.S., just as
we never allowed the Soviets to
dominate our policy. I think the U.S.
government realizes our position now
and understands that we have no
designs to crush Israel," he said.
Turning to the oil crisis, Ghorbal
declared, "The Arab embargo may be
an annoyance to some, but perhaps it
has saved many lives. We knew that we
had to use all the means in our power

to regain our occupied territority; we
showed the world that the Arab
nations have powerful economic cards
to play."
Ghorbal spoke a day before Arab
countries announced they had lifted
the embargo.
Second Thoughts
"I think the Israeli leadership now
has second thoughts about their policy
of occupation," he added. "In the
years after the 1967 war they sold
themselves the idea that their security
relied on holding Arab territory, in the
Sinai, the Golan Heights and
elsewhere.
"In 1971 they rejected a peace
settlement in exchange for the
territory, but in October last year they
learned the hard way that their
position was unjust," he noted.
Noting that the Suez Canal would
soon be opened, Ghorbal said, "As
long as Israel holds our territory or
that of any Arab state, and as long as
there is no Palestinian state, we could
not allow Israeli ships to pass through
the canal. Only when there is lasting
peace can we allow the Israeli flag to
fly there."
Ghorbal cited recent instability in
the Israeli government as a sign that
"things have changed." He stated,
"People used to say that the Arabs
were hopelessly disorganized, but now
the tables are turned. Today the Arab
nations are firmly united, and we
cannot allow the internal squabbles of
Israel to interfere with the Geneva
peace talks. Those problems aren't our
fault."
