## Stanford Will Rise Again 
### Dave Robinson 
Stanford's season of false hope came to an
appropriately dismal close Friday night at Berkeley,
leaving fans in a quandary about whether to
maintain any hope at all for next year.
The tall, talented and hopelessly inconsistent
Cardinals, picked at the start of the season to finish
anywhere from second to fourth in the Pacific
Eight, ended the season in sixth place with a 5-9
league record.
It's true that the Cardinals lost seven games by
three points or less. It's true that Stanford nearly
defeated UCLA, USC twice and Oregon. But it's
also true that the Cards lost by 17 points to Air
Force, a team whose tallest starter measured a mere
6-6. Predictably, Stanford was outre bounded by
the Falcons.
Other games brought similar disappointments. It
all started with a lackluster performance against a
mediocre Nevada-Reno team. One sportswriter was
particularly perceptive in assessing the 76-69 loss.
"Playing as if it were their first practice instead of
their first game... ."
Three nights later the Cards reversed gears in a
63-61 upset over eventual WCAC champion USF.
Three more victories followed before the Cards
were victimized by a set of twins wearing striped
shirts in Lexington, Ky. Willard and Wayne Smith
blew their whistles often enough to foul out three
Cardinal starters and insure a 78-77 win for the
host Wildcats.
Little Consolation
Stanford then lost its opener in the ECAC
Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden, earning
the dubious distinction of meeting St. Louis in a
10:30 a.m. consolation game before 100 sleepy
fans. It was little consolation that the Cards
triumphed 76-63, especially since six straight losses
followed.
The Cards then managed to win six of their
next seven games before ending the season with
four conference losses by a total of nine points. It
all added up to 11 victories, 14 losses and
considerable frustration.
Several years ago, an 11-14 season would hardly
be a cause for alarm. This year, though, fans who
foresee further disaster have reacted indignantly.
Irate letters to the editor calling for the resignation
of coach Howie Dallmar have frequented the Daily
opinions page, and one "frustrated Stanford
rooter" has addressed the Daily sports department
with two tirades.
"As long as Dallmar is (coach?) the Stanford
players are being short-changed," charged the
anonymous critic. "Lack of help from the coach in
game situations, poor recruiting effort, iack of
warmth, concem with academic and personal
problems and communication are Stanford's

problems. ... Our patience with Dallmar is at an
end."
Another Chance
Even tasteless KPIX-TV sportscaster Milt Kahn
indicated Friday night that Dallmar should be
replaced. That condemnation, however, may
represent the best case for giving Dallmar another
chance.
By his own admission, Stanford's 1973-74
season was "obviously disappointing." But the fault
may not lie with Dallmar. As contrived as it sounds,
the Cards were indeed "snakebitten" in several
games, losing to Kentucky, Oregon and UCLA
despite sensational efforts. Dallmar was certainly
not responsible for the fact that several officials
were intimidated by rabid home court fans, or that
Ron Lee sank a miraculous 27-foot jump shot at
the buzzer to sink the Cards in Eugene.
Despite the disappointments, Dallmar has
maintained his unusually mature attitude. Poring
over a recruiting chart in his office this week, he
expressed the belief that this season's
disappointments won't affect next year's team
psychologically. "We're just going to start a whole
new year. We'll start with a positive approach."
Recruiting Needs
For now, Dallmar and assistant coaches Bub
Bowling and Billy Jones are off recruiting,
presumably looking for a complete guard and a
quick forward who could help the Cardinals
immediately in 1974-75, when Dallmar begins his
21st season as Stanford's head coach.
If next year's season follows the pattern of the
previous two — if the outstanding talent of the
Class of '75 never reaches its full potential — there
will be a case for Dallmar's dismissal.
Next year, though, will be a unique season for
the Pac-8. UCLA, which loses two first-team
All-Americans, will be legitimately vulnerable for
the first time in eight years. Oregon will be strong,
as will Oregon State, USC and Washington, but the
strongest team should be the Stanford Cardinals.
Howie Dallmar will continue to sit rather
passively on the Stanford bench. He won't scream
incessantly at referees and teach his players dirty,
cheap tricks like Oregon's Dick Harter. He won't
bait opposing players verbally from his seat on the
bench like John Wooden, who somehow masks
such behavior with his outwardly genteel
appearance.
Dallmar will continue to coach with a maturity
often mistaken for indifference, quietly making up
for the horrors of the past two seasons.
Stanford will win the Pac-8 championship in
1975, and Dallmar's critics will be forced to eat
their words.
