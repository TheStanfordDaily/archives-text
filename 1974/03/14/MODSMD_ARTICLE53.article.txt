# Routine Win Caps JV Season
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
BERKELEY—A season which
began with little hope for victories
of any sort ended here Friday
night when the Stanford junior
varsity cagers scored a routine,
true-to-form 72-62 win over the
California JV to finish an 11-6
campaign.
The Cardinals' eighth win in
their last nine games was achieved
with the same steady dominance
that characterized the other
victories in a skien which rescued
the JV's from what appeared last
January to be an exercise in
mediocrity.
Cal fell because Stanford
center Scott Russell, who "didn't
feel too good," controlled the
boards and led the Card scoring
attack (13 rebounds and 19
points). The Bears lost because
Terry McCartin had regained his
hot hand (16 points), and because
Sven Walker did what he had done
all season: give Russell help on the
boards (seven caroms), and
provide a solid scoring punch (11
points).
In short, Cal lost its second
game to the Cards this season
because Stanford played the kind
of basketball of which it has been
capable since Billy Jones turned
this group of walk-ons into a
cohesive unit.
Late Arrival
The Bears made a fight of the
contest for a while this time,
thanks mainly to the fact the
Cards arrived at Harmon Gym just
10 minutes before tip-off. "They
jammed us up a little bit this
trip," said Jones. "We had no
warmup— we spent the first 15
minutes [of the game] tryin' to
get ready."
Indeed, Cal held a 27-26 lead
after Mike Ferreboeul had scored
three straight baskets with 20
seconds left in the first half, but

STANFORD JV (72)— Walker 11,
Jurgensen 6, Russell 19, Session 10,
McCartin 16, Moroski 9, Brain 0,
Bowen 0, Power l.Oshetsky O.Turner
0. FG 29, FT 14, PF 15.
CALIFORNIA JV (62)— Olds 25,
Ferreboeuf 8, Cole 6, Maxwell 2, Hill
8, Davis 4, Finkle 6, Kramer 3. FG 29,
FT 4, PF 22.
Halftime score: Stanford 28,
California 27.

McCartin took the advantage
away just before the buzzer with a
hoop which made Stanford a
28-27 leader.
The Cards never trailed from
that point, launching a blitz early
in the second period which
provided a 44-33 lead six minutes
into the half.
The Bears closed to within
50-47 at the nine-minute mark,
relying on 6-4'/2 center Gerry
Olds' scoring and rebounding (25
points and 13 caroms) to stifle
the Cards. Cal played without Pat
Motola, whose 25 points kept the
Bears close in their 82-68 loss to
Stanford last January.
'They Were Worse'
As a team, however, Cal didn't
look much better this time
around. "They were worse," said
customarily frank Cardinal guard

Warner Session, who scored 10
points.
Cal lacked depth, with only
three substitutes on the Bear
bench compared to Stanford's 10,
and the Berkeleyites tired as the
game dragged on, committing a
multitude of fouls. Stanford led
by 18 when Jones filled the lineup
with subs with two minutes left.
Friday's game allowed three
Cardinals to pass the 200-point
mark for the season. Russell,
Walker, and McCartin finished
first, second and fourth in total
team scoring, but Marty Moroski's
nine points gave him a 14.3
average, tops for the JV this
season.
Despite their surprising
showing for the year, most JV
cagers were not optimistic over
their chances for filling spots on
the beleaguered Stanford varsity
next season, believing that Howie
Dallmar's staff will look elsewhere
for new prospects.
Jones, however, earlier had
pinpointed Russell and McCartin
as possibilities for varsity play.
Moroski practiced and
occasionally traveled with the
varsity this season.

FT 4, PF 22.
Halftime score: Stanford 28,
California 27.

McCartin took the advantage
away just before the buzzer with a
hoop which made Stanford a
28-27 leader.
The Cards never trailed from
that point, launching a blitz early
in the second period which
provided a 44-33 lead six minutes
into the half.
The Bears closed to within
50-47 at the nine-minute mark,
relying on 6-4'/2 center Gerry
Olds' scoring and rebounding (25
points and 13 caroms) to stifle
the Cards. Cal played without Pat
Motola, whose 25 points kept the
Bears close in their 82-68 loss to
Stanford last January.
'They Were Worse'
As a team, however, Cal didn't
look much better this time
around. "They were worse," said
customarily frank Cardinal guard

Warner Session, who scored 10
points.
Cal lacked depth, with only
three substitutes on the Bear
bench compared to Stanford's 10,
and the Berkeleyites tired as the
game dragged on, committing a
multitude of fouls. Stanford led
by 18 when Jones filled the lineup
with subs with two minutes left.
Friday's game allowed three
Cardinals to pass the 200-point
mark for the season. Russell,
Walker, and McCartin finished
first, second and fourth in total
team scoring, but Marty Moroski's
nine points gave him a 14.3
average, tops for the JV this
season.
Despite their surprising
showing for the year, most JV
cagers were not optimistic over
their chances for filling spots on
the beleaguered Stanford varsity
next season, believing that Howie
Dallmar's staff will look elsewhere
for new prospects.
Jones, however, earlier had
pinpointed Russell and McCartin
as possibilities for varsity play.
Moroski practiced and
occasionally traveled with the
varsity this season.
BERKELEY—A season which
began with little hope for victories
of any sort ended here Friday
night when the Stanford junior
varsity cagers scored a routine,
true-to-form 72-62 win over the
California JV to finish an 11-6
campaign.
The Cardinals' eighth win in
their last nine games was achieved
with the same steady dominance
that characterized the other
victories in a skien which rescued
the JV's from what appeared last
January to be an exercise in
mediocrity.
Cal fell because Stanford
center Scott Russell, who "didn't
feel too good," controlled the
boards and led the Card scoring
attack (13 rebounds and 19
points). The Bears lost because
Terry McCartin had regained his
hot hand (16 points), and because
Sven Walker did what he had done
all season: give Russell help on the
boards (seven caroms), and
provide a solid scoring punch (11
points).
In short, Cal lost its second
game to the Cards this season
because Stanford played the kind
of basketball of which it has been
capable since Billy Jones turned
this group of walk-ons into a
cohesive unit.
Late Arrival
The Bears made a fight of the
contest for a while this time,
thanks mainly to the fact the
Cards arrived at Harmon Gym just
10 minutes before tip-off. "They
jammed us up a little bit this
trip," said Jones. "We had no
warmup— we spent the first 15
minutes [of the game] tryin' to
get ready."
Indeed, Cal held a 27-26 lead
after Mike Ferreboeul had scored
three straight baskets with 20
seconds left in the first half, but

STANFORD JV (72)— Walker 11,
Jurgensen 6, Russell 19, Session 10,
