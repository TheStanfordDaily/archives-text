## NBA Showdown 
### Don Tollefson 
Like distant relatives who forgot each other at Christmas time, the
Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers both seem intent on
presenting the other with the NBA Pacific Division crown as a belated
gift.
For weeks, the two have prolonged the title race with
performances that can only be desribed as schizoid. As easily as
either team will beat a Boston or Milwaukee on one night, they will
lose to a Portland or Cleveland the next.
Such inconsistency has almost eliminated the possibility of both
the Lakers and Warriors making the playoffs, since Detroit, the third
place team in the Midwest Division, needs only two more victories to
finish the season with a better percentage than either West Coast
aggregation pos r ibly can.
So the two teams, who are separated by less than a game, must
meet twice this weekend to decide who is the most charitable. When
the two met in their last battle, both seemed intent on losing. Rick
Barry's shooting was as cold as the stare he melts referees with and yet
the Lakers barely hung on for a victory that was accomplished
without any finesse.
When the teams meet again tomorrow night in Los Angeles and
Saturday night in Oakland, Warrior center Nate Thurmond will more
than likely join Jerry West on the sidelines.Thurmond sustained an
arch injury a week ago against Milwaukee and he is a doubtful
performer — though not nearly as doubtful as West, who may not play
again this season, if ever.
With each team missing a superstar, the contests this weekend will
depend more than ever on the performances of their other resident
superstars — Rick Barry for the Warriors and Gale Goodrich for the
Lakers. As Barry and Goodrich go, so will their respective teams.
Rick Barry has remained something of a mystery ever since his
return from exile last season. He has always been a player of
undeniably massive talent which has often been neutralized by his
similarly healthy supply of moodiness. His 29 years do not seem to
have matured him all that much and he still gets fined for pushing
referees.
After Thurmond was injured in the second quarter of that
Milwaukee game a week ago, the Warriors seemed on the verge of a
disastrous slide since they were just beginning a brutal five-game road
trip. But Barry, with a ferocity unbefitting his styled hair, stemmed
the tide.
First Barry hit a 22-foot shot at the buzzer that night to give the
locals a 97-95 win over the hated Bucks. The following night he rallied
the Warriors from an early deficit, and with the help of guard Jim
Barnett led them to a 106-96 win over Philadelphia.
Sunday Rick scored 30, but the Warriors still fell to Capital, and as
if blaming himself for that loss, Barry upped his total to 40 the next
night, as Golden State shocked Detroit 120-108. Tuesday night he had
a poor second half as the Pistons avenged their loss, 113-108. Still,
because of Barry primarily, the Warriors returned home having won
three of five on a trip that could have easily shattered their playoff
hopes.
Goodrich, who always played in West's sizeable shadow, has had
some equally impressive recent performances for the Lakers. Typical
of them was his 34-point effort Tuesday night which led Los Angeles
to a 109-102 upset of the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
Critics have often said that Goodrich scored prolifically in the past
only because other teams had to overplay West. But the former UCLA
star has done much to still the skeptics this season. The Lakers will
also need a strong performance down the stretch from Connie
Hawkins, who is one of the few players in the league who can match
Barry, both in talent and in moodiness.
After they face each other this weekend, the Warriors will have
seven games left and the Lakers will have five. Golden State must face
Milwaukee next Tuesday and Buffalo next Thursday, but both of
those are home games and the other five contests are against Portland
(2), Seattle (2) and Phoenix.
The Lakers obviously have the tougher assignment facing New
York, Milwaukee, Chicago, Buffalo and Seattle, but quality of
opposition is amazingly deceiving with both the Warriors and the
Lakers.
A prediction in this weekend's games is almost suicidal since
neither team has peformed logically this year. The most appropriate
outcome would be for each to forfeit a game. It is safe to predict that
whichever team makes the playoffs will be a decided underdog. But
given their disposition to continually confound the experts, that team
just might win the whole thing. Who knows how mad Rick Barry can
get?

Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers both seem intent on
presenting the other with the NBA Pacific Division crown as a belated
gift.
For weeks, the two have prolonged the title race with
performances that can only be desribed as schizoid. As easily as
either team will beat a Boston or Milwaukee on one night, they will
lose to a Portland or Cleveland the next.
Such inconsistency has almost eliminated the possibility of both
the Lakers and Warriors making the playoffs, since Detroit, the third
place team in the Midwest Division, needs only two more victories to
finish the season with a better percentage than either West Coast
aggregation pos r ibly can.
So the two teams, who are separated by less than a game, must
meet twice this weekend to decide who is the most charitable. When
the two met in their last battle, both seemed intent on losing. Rick
Barry's shooting was as cold as the stare he melts referees with and yet
the Lakers barely hung on for a victory that was accomplished
without any finesse.
When the teams meet again tomorrow night in Los Angeles and
Saturday night in Oakland, Warrior center Nate Thurmond will more
than likely join Jerry West on the sidelines.Thurmond sustained an
arch injury a week ago against Milwaukee and he is a doubtful
performer — though not nearly as doubtful as West, who may not play
again this season, if ever.
With each team missing a superstar, the contests this weekend will
depend more than ever on the performances of their other resident
superstars — Rick Barry for the Warriors and Gale Goodrich for the
Lakers. As Barry and Goodrich go, so will their respective teams.
Rick Barry has remained something of a mystery ever since his
return from exile last season. He has always been a player of
undeniably massive talent which has often been neutralized by his
similarly healthy supply of moodiness. His 29 years do not seem to
have matured him all that much and he still gets fined for pushing
referees.
After Thurmond was injured in the second quarter of that
Milwaukee game a week ago, the Warriors seemed on the verge of a
disastrous slide since they were just beginning a brutal five-game road
trip. But Barry, with a ferocity unbefitting his styled hair, stemmed
the tide.
First Barry hit a 22-foot shot at the buzzer that night to give the
locals a 97-95 win over the hated Bucks. The following night he rallied
the Warriors from an early deficit, and with the help of guard Jim
Barnett led them to a 106-96 win over Philadelphia.
Sunday Rick scored 30, but the Warriors still fell to Capital, and as
if blaming himself for that loss, Barry upped his total to 40 the next
night, as Golden State shocked Detroit 120-108. Tuesday night he had
a poor second half as the Pistons avenged their loss, 113-108. Still,
because of Barry primarily, the Warriors returned home having won
three of five on a trip that could have easily shattered their playoff
hopes.
Goodrich, who always played in West's sizeable shadow, has had
some equally impressive recent performances for the Lakers. Typical
of them was his 34-point effort Tuesday night which led Los Angeles
to a 109-102 upset of the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
Critics have often said that Goodrich scored prolifically in the past
only because other teams had to overplay West. But the former UCLA
star has done much to still the skeptics this season. The Lakers will
also need a strong performance down the stretch from Connie
Hawkins, who is one of the few players in the league who can match
Barry, both in talent and in moodiness.
After they face each other this weekend, the Warriors will have
seven games left and the Lakers will have five. Golden State must face
Milwaukee next Tuesday and Buffalo next Thursday, but both of
those are home games and the other five contests are against Portland
(2), Seattle (2) and Phoenix.
The Lakers obviously have the tougher assignment facing New
York, Milwaukee, Chicago, Buffalo and Seattle, but quality of
opposition is amazingly deceiving with both the Warriors and the
Lakers.
A prediction in this weekend's games is almost suicidal since
neither team has peformed logically this year. The most appropriate
outcome would be for each to forfeit a game. It is safe to predict that
whichever team makes the playoffs will be a decided underdog. But
given their disposition to continually confound the experts, that team
just might win the whole thing. Who knows how mad Rick Barry can
get?
