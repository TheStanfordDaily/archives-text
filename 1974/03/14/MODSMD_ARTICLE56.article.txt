# Hug, Marcy Victorious
## Gymnasts Win Pac-8 Events 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Stanford's gymnastics team finished third in the
Pacific Eight championships at Eugene last
weekend, as Steve Hug won the all-around title in
the team competition and Ted Marcy scored a
sensational 19.25 sidehorse victory.
Five Cardinal gymnasts qualified for the NCAA
meet on April 4-6 at Penn State by placing in the
top three at Eugene. Besides Hug and Marcy, Bob
Anderson qualified in floor exercise, Shawn
Skerrett in the vault and Howard Bessen on the
rings.
California successfully defended its team title,
winning the meet with a 320.5 total for the
compulsory and optional competitions. Oregon was
a close second with a surprising 319.25, and
Stanford followed at 313.3.
Hug surprised no one by defending his
all-around title, taking the compulsories with a 54.5
total and the optionals with 53.6. Anderson, who
has been troubled by back problems most of the
season, managed eighth in the all-around with
scores of 49.85 and 51.25.
Coach Sadao Hamada was generally pleased with
his squad's performance. This was his second
straight third place finish as the Cardinal
gymnastics mentor.
High Bar Disaster
"As a team we did very well," Hamada said. "We
were leading in the compulsories up to the parallel
bars, but lost some ground there and then the high
bar was a disaster. If we'd had one or two more it
might have been a different story."
Hamada was surprised by high level of
competition at this year's meet. "The teams on the
whole are much, much better than last year.
Oregon has really improved." (The Ducks finished

last in 1973.)
Though the Cards only finished third as a team,
Hamada feels that individually Stanford's gymnasts
are the best in the league. In the individual
competition Saturday, the squad proved him right
by taking two firsts and four seconds to add to
Hug's all-around title.
Anderson led off by grabbing a second in floor
exercise with an 18.275 total. In the individual
finals, the compulsory and optional scores are
averaged and then added to the third routine's
score.
Best Of Meet
Marcy followed Anderson with his amazing
19.25 win on the sidehorse, highlighted by a 9.65
routine on Saturday â€” the high mark of the meet.
Bessen missed a chance for the rings title, falling to
Cal's Mark Lundy with an 18.575 score for second.
Skerrett barely qualified for the finals in the
vault, but got off a couple of beautiful leaps
Saturday and moved into second place at 17.975.
Hug was not content to rest on his laurels after
grabbing the all-around title. He picked up some of
the slack in Stanford's weak events, taking the
parallel bars with an 18.7 score and finishing
second in the high bar with an 18.125 total.
The five NCAA qualifiers will spend the next
three weeks "polishing up every move and getting
more consistency into their routines" according to
Hamada.
The coach feels that all five have a chance of
placing, although only Hug and Marcy placed last
year. Hug will be going after an unprecedented
third national crown in the all-around. He was also
individual champion in the parallel bars and high
bar last year. Marcy will be out to take the
sidehorse after a fourth place finish in 1973.
