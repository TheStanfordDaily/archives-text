## Plumbers Triumph 
### PETE BHATIA 
Cool heads and dominating
rebounding were the keys Sunday
as the Plumbers took the
intramural "A" division basketball
title, 43-40, over the Theta Delts.
The Theta Delts took an early
2-0 lead on Steve Hoch's two free
throws but three straight
three-point plays and two Theta
Delt technicals gave the Plumbers
a 15-8 lead midway through the
first half. The trend continued as
Plumbers Dan Broderick and Ed
McKinley controlled the boards
and the Theta Delts picked up
another technical to give the
Plumbers a 24-15 halftime bulge.
The Plumbers came out
smoking in the second half and
spurted to a 35-20 lead with seven
minutes to play. Mark Sweeney
had seven points in the Plumber
outburst, six coming on
long-range set shots.
But the Plumbers were up to
their usual tricks, racing out into
the lead and almost getting caught
in the end. After taking time out
with six minutes to play, the
Plumbers went to sleep and the
Theta Delts caught fire. The Axe
Thefts outscored the Plumbers
20-7 during that stretch, largely

on the hot outside shooting of
Shaun Sullivan.
The lead was then cut to 41-40
with a minute to go on a Terry
Winsor hook shot, but Plumber
center Broderick got behind the
scrambling Theta Delt defense for
a layin with 32 seconds to play to
insure the victory.
Sullivan was the game's high
scorer with 16 points, all but four
coming in the second half.
Broderick and Rob Quick led the
Plumbers with 10 apiece.
Theta Delt coach and author of
this article Pete Bhatia, who
needed a victory to become the
nation's winningest coach on the
basis of won-loss percentage, said,
"Two things made the difference.
First, they controlled the boards
more than we would have liked
them to. Second, we didn't keep
our heads on the court. Granted
the officiating was terrible and
one ref was obviously out to get
us, but there is still no excuse for
getting three technicals in any
game — let alone the
championship game."
Plumber coach Stan Wilson
agreed. "Our board play was
excellent. We had a slight height
advantage but they are a great
jumping team. I was very pleased
with our board effort. Its fun to
watch Pete [Bhatia] get mad and
kick his chair into the stands."
It was the fourth trip in a row
into the basketball finals for the
Theta Delts and the third in a row
for Broderick. Ironically,
Broderick's two previous
appearances were for the Theta
Delts. He chose not to play for
the house this year.

In Sunday's "B" finals, Tony
Brisco's hot outside shooting and
Gerald Wilson's drives paced Sixth
Ward's 42-34 triumph over Otero.
Otero took the early lead but
Sixth Ward's aggressive board play

proved too much. The Ward ran
away in the second half after
enjoying a slim 22-21 halftime
advantage. Brisco finished with a
game-high 16 points, while
Wilson, a safety on the football
team, recorded 12. Alex Battey
led Otero with 12.

spurted to a 35-20 lead with seven
minutes to play. Mark Sweeney
had seven points in the Plumber
outburst, six coming on
long-range set shots.
But the Plumbers were up to
their usual tricks, racing out into
the lead and almost getting caught
in the end. After taking time out
with six minutes to play, the
Plumbers went to sleep and the
Theta Delts caught fire. The Axe
Thefts outscored the Plumbers
20-7 during that stretch, largely

on the hot outside shooting of
Shaun Sullivan.
The lead was then cut to 41-40
with a minute to go on a Terry
Winsor hook shot, but Plumber
center Broderick got behind the
scrambling Theta Delt defense for
a layin with 32 seconds to play to
insure the victory.
Sullivan was the game's high
scorer with 16 points, all but four
coming in the second half.
Broderick and Rob Quick led the
Plumbers with 10 apiece.
Theta Delt coach and author of
this article Pete Bhatia, who
needed a victory to become the
nation's winningest coach on the
basis of won-loss percentage, said,
"Two things made the difference.
First, they controlled the boards
more than we would have liked
them to. Second, we didn't keep
our heads on the court. Granted
the officiating was terrible and
one ref was obviously out to get
us, but there is still no excuse for
getting three technicals in any
game — let alone the
championship game."
Plumber coach Stan Wilson
agreed. "Our board play was
excellent. We had a slight height
advantage but they are a great
jumping team. I was very pleased
with our board effort. Its fun to
watch Pete [Bhatia] get mad and
kick his chair into the stands."
It was the fourth trip in a row
into the basketball finals for the
Theta Delts and the third in a row
for Broderick. Ironically,
Broderick's two previous
appearances were for the Theta
Delts. He chose not to play for
the house this year.

In Sunday's "B" finals, Tony
Brisco's hot outside shooting and
Gerald Wilson's drives paced Sixth
Ward's 42-34 triumph over Otero.
Otero took the early lead but
Sixth Ward's aggressive board play

proved too much. The Ward ran
away in the second half after
enjoying a slim 22-21 halftime
advantage. Brisco finished with a
game-high 16 points, while
Wilson, a safety on the football
team, recorded 12. Alex Battey
led Otero with 12.

a layin with 32 seconds to play to
insure the victory.
Sullivan was the game's high
scorer with 16 points, all but four
coming in the second half.
Broderick and Rob Quick led the
Plumbers with 10 apiece.
Theta Delt coach and author of
this article Pete Bhatia, who
needed a victory to become the
nation's winningest coach on the
basis of won-loss percentage, said,
"Two things made the difference.
First, they controlled the boards
more than we would have liked
them to. Second, we didn't keep
our heads on the court. Granted
the officiating was terrible and
one ref was obviously out to get
us, but there is still no excuse for
getting three technicals in any
game — let alone the
championship game."
Plumber coach Stan Wilson
agreed. "Our board play was
excellent. We had a slight height
advantage but they are a great
jumping team. I was very pleased
with our board effort. Its fun to
watch Pete [Bhatia] get mad and
kick his chair into the stands."
It was the fourth trip in a row
into the basketball finals for the
Theta Delts and the third in a row
for Broderick. Ironically,
Broderick's two previous
appearances were for the Theta
Delts. He chose not to play for
the house this year.

In Sunday's "B" finals, Tony
Brisco's hot outside shooting and
Gerald Wilson's drives paced Sixth
Ward's 42-34 triumph over Otero.
Otero took the early lead but
Sixth Ward's aggressive board play

proved too much. The Ward ran
away in the second half after
enjoying a slim 22-21 halftime
advantage. Brisco finished with a
game-high 16 points, while
Wilson, a safety on the football
team, recorded 12. Alex Battey
led Otero with 12.

Cool heads and dominating
rebounding were the keys Sunday
as the Plumbers took the
intramural "A" division basketball
title, 43-40, over the Theta Delts.
The Theta Delts took an early
2-0 lead on Steve Hoch's two free
throws but three straight
three-point plays and two Theta
Delt technicals gave the Plumbers
a 15-8 lead midway through the
first half. The trend continued as
Plumbers Dan Broderick and Ed
McKinley controlled the boards
and the Theta Delts picked up
another technical to give the
Plumbers a 24-15 halftime bulge.
The Plumbers came out
smoking in the second half and
spurted to a 35-20 lead with seven
minutes to play. Mark Sweeney
had seven points in the Plumber
outburst, six coming on
long-range set shots.
But the Plumbers were up to
their usual tricks, racing out into
the lead and almost getting caught
in the end. After taking time out
with six minutes to play, the
Plumbers went to sleep and the
Theta Delts caught fire. The Axe
Thefts outscored the Plumbers
20-7 during that stretch, largely

on the hot outside shooting of
Shaun Sullivan.
The lead was then cut to 41-40
with a minute to go on a Terry
Winsor hook shot, but Plumber
center Broderick got behind the
scrambling Theta Delt defense for
a layin with 32 seconds to play to
insure the victory.
Sullivan was the game's high
scorer with 16 points, all but four
coming in the second half.
