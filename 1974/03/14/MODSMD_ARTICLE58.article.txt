# Tough Field Tests Cardinal Golfers
## 
### 
"Stanford's defense of the Pacific Coast Invitational golf title over
spring break will be tougher than coach Bud Finger expected.
"I didn't anticipate a very good field," Finger said. It turns out,
however, that USC, Arizona State, Long Beach State and Fresno
State—all national powers—are entered in the second annual event
March 28-29 at the Sandpiper Golf Course in Goleta (near Santa
Barbara).
So now, Finger says, the Cards will have to play outstanding golf to
win their second straight title.
USC, which features U.S. Amateur champion Craig Stadler and
Pacific Eight title-holder Mark Pfeil, ranks as the favorite in the
24-team field. Stanford, with consistent juniors Aly Trompas, Dave
Baskins, George Pettinger and Conrad Nilmeier, should challenge the
Trojans. Those four players currently sport competitive averages
ranging from 72.0 to 74.3.

Last year, Trompas finished
second in the individual
competition, trailing Stadler by
seven strokes.
Saturday, Stanford improved
its dual match record to 5-1 with
an easy 25'/2-l 1 /2 victory over the
Stanford Golf Club on the
Stanford course. All six Card
golfers shot 74 or better, paced by
Nilmeier's one-under-par 70.
Freshmen Brent Murray and
Glenn Goethels, who will travel to
Goleta as Stanford's fifth and
sixth men, contributed impressive
scores of 71 and 72. Murray's
round included a three-under-par
32 on the back nine.
Before the Pacific Coast
tourney, Stanford will compete in
the Confidence Open on March
22-24 at Half Moon Bay. The
Cards will enter a six-man team in
the hastily organized collegiate
division, but the main purpose of
the event is to provide top-flight
individual competition.
