# Trustees Approve $80 Million Operating Budget For 1974-75

### DON COX 
The Stanford Board of Trustees Tuesday approved
guidelines for a balanced operating budget of $80.3 million
in 1974-75.
The 1974-75 guidelines are the product of the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP), a program in its fifth and final
year designed originally to slow the growth rate of
University expenditures and achieve a balanced budget in
1974-75.
A key element in BAP was a faculty and student
advisory committee which functioned as a critical jury of
the budgetary recommentations forwarded by departmental
deans and administrative officers.
The committee considered the consequences of
alternative income adjustments and budget reductions and
recommended to the Provost those with the least severe
consequences.
Continued Program
While BAP formally ends next year. Provost William
Miller told the Faculty Senate last week that Stanford faces
the "real possibility" that it will need a continuous
reallocation program to make the best long-term use of its
resources.
Vice Provost Raymond Bacchetti, in a briefing last week,
outlined the "decentralization" of the reallocation process
and the increased role of the departmental deans in
budgetary decisions.
Bacchetti acknowledged the end of student input into
the reallocation program.
"There is a concious effort to have the decisions made at
a level where they are best and most appropriately made,"
he said.
Tuition Hike
To help achieve a balanced budget, tuition rates are
being hiked $240 next year.
Among the reasons behind the increase was an estimated
growth in parental incomes and a higher, more accurate
assessment of parental income expectations.

The latter is attributed to the establishment of income
estimate validation by means of certified income tax forms
for students on financial aid.
The Office of Financial Aids, which conducted a study
of the variations between the estimated and reported family
incomes of undergraduates receiving financial aid, found
$250,000 of unjustified disparities.
Worrying About 'Gap'
Deputy Vice President Kenneth Creighton said that the
tuition gap between Stanford and California state schools
"is beginning to worry us."
Vice President Robert Augsburger recognized this gap
but noted California scholarships many Stanford students
receive are increasing in value and that this will help offset
the tuition hikes.
The large number of tenured professors "will make life a
little more expensive" for the University, said Bacchetti.
"We're doing what we can to smooth this out," although
the awkward age distribution of the faculty makes this
difficult he added.
Faculty salary increases average six percent although the
funds are distributed as a function of merit, promotions,
and special circumstances within the different departments.
Endowment Increase
One of the principal objectives of the University's
financial managers is to increase the endowment and to
reduce the payout from the endowment.
President Richard Lyman said that most
universities-including Stanford-have been using too much of
their endowment.
The endowment is a collection of investments, valued at
$356 million at the end of 1972-73, whose interest makes
up about 20 percent of the operating budget income.
While the Dow Jones stock market indicator dropped
13.6 percent last year, Augsburger said the University has
"come out reasonably whole."
"While we're poorer than a year ago, we are a lot less
poorer than many others," he said.
