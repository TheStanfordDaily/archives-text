# Women Face Fast Swimming Field
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
In swimming most records are improved a fraction of a second at a
time. Today through Saturday Stanford's women swimmers will be
competing in a national championship where in one year qualifying
times dropped by a startling 11 seconds in the 400 freestyle.
Proportionately faster times were required in qualify for all events,
said senior Sue Trupin, a member of both the 1973 and 1974 teams.
Stanford's seven-member team will face a field of swimmers from
more than 80 schools in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (AIAW) competition at Penn State University in
University Park, Pa. Last year's four-woman team placed 40th among
the 80 schools participating in Moscow, Idaho, but Trupin feels
Stanford is in good shape to better its 1973 finish.
She sees the faster qualifying times as a consequence of improved
collegiate swimming programs and young college swimmers continuing
in the spirit of earlier AAU training. The Stanford team bears out
both of these observations.

Freshmen Vicki Hays, Nan Leuschel and Diane Dillon represent the
youthful majority. Sophomores Jackie Brink and Kathi Heinze are
veterans of the 1973 nationals. Malasian Olympian Mei Ong, who
qualified for last year's meet but was unable to make the trip, is the

only junior on the team.
It is a young but confident
squad. Most of the women have
AAU experience. Hays, who
attended the World Acquatic
Championships in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia last summer, is looking
beyond the AIAW meet to the
AAU nationals in April.
Heinze and Brink agree that
the team's training and attitude
are markedly better than they
were last year. Everyone
expressed the belief that early
morning workouts with the men's
team and individual attention
from men's coaches Jim Gaughran
and Jeff Hammett were big
factors in improving
performances.
Trupin echoed the sentiments
of other swimmers when she said,
"The women's program just isn't
meeting our needs, even with two
coaches."
However, the cooperation of
Gaughran and Hammett and the
individual commitment of team
members have overcome program
shortcomings, leaving the seven
optimistic. Hopes are particularly
high for the 200 and 400-meter
medley relays. Hays, Ong, Trupin
and Leuschel will swim the 200
while Heinze will replace Leuschel
in the 400.
Coach Betsy Weeks points out
that Arizona State, the AIAW
champion for the last three years
and winner of Stanford's
February Invitational, will be the
team to beat. Brink adds UCLA,
Princeton and Florida to the list
of tough competitors. "It would
be fantastic if we could come in
10th," she said.

Stanford is in good shape to better its 1973 finish.
She sees the faster qualifying times as a consequence of improved
collegiate swimming programs and young college swimmers continuing
in the spirit of earlier AAU training. The Stanford team bears out
both of these observations.

Freshmen Vicki Hays, Nan Leuschel and Diane Dillon represent the
youthful majority. Sophomores Jackie Brink and Kathi Heinze are
veterans of the 1973 nationals. Malasian Olympian Mei Ong, who
qualified for last year's meet but was unable to make the trip, is the

only junior on the team.
It is a young but confident
squad. Most of the women have
AAU experience. Hays, who
attended the World Acquatic
Championships in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia last summer, is looking
beyond the AIAW meet to the
AAU nationals in April.
Heinze and Brink agree that
the team's training and attitude
are markedly better than they
were last year. Everyone
expressed the belief that early
morning workouts with the men's
team and individual attention
from men's coaches Jim Gaughran
and Jeff Hammett were big
factors in improving
performances.
Trupin echoed the sentiments
of other swimmers when she said,
"The women's program just isn't
meeting our needs, even with two
coaches."
However, the cooperation of
Gaughran and Hammett and the
individual commitment of team
members have overcome program
shortcomings, leaving the seven
optimistic. Hopes are particularly
high for the 200 and 400-meter
medley relays. Hays, Ong, Trupin
and Leuschel will swim the 200
while Heinze will replace Leuschel
in the 400.
Coach Betsy Weeks points out
that Arizona State, the AIAW
champion for the last three years
and winner of Stanford's
February Invitational, will be the
team to beat. Brink adds UCLA,
Princeton and Florida to the list
of tough competitors. "It would
be fantastic if we could come in
10th," she said.

SET FOR THE NATlONALS—Stanford's Mei Ong will compete in four events today through Saturday at
the Women's national collegiate swimming meet at Penn State. Ong, a member of the 1972 Malaysian

In swimming most records are improved a fraction of a second at a
time. Today through Saturday Stanford's women swimmers will be
competing in a national championship where in one year qualifying
times dropped by a startling 11 seconds in the 400 freestyle.
Proportionately faster times were required in qualify for all events,
said senior Sue Trupin, a member of both the 1973 and 1974 teams.
Stanford's seven-member team will face a field of swimmers from
more than 80 schools in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (AIAW) competition at Penn State University in
University Park, Pa. Last year's four-woman team placed 40th among
the 80 schools participating in Moscow, Idaho, but Trupin feels
