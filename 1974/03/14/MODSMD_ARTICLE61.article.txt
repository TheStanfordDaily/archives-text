# Ruggers Set For Monterey
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's rugby team will bt
looking for its ninth Monterey
National Rugby Tournament
Championship on March 23, when
the ruggers face Montana in the
first game of the tourney at 8 a.m.
in Pebble Beach.
The Cards are coming off a 6-3
upset victory over California last
Saturday in Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium. The Cards fell behind
early in the contest when Steve
Montgomery picked up a Stanford
fumble and scored a drop goal to
give Cal a 3-0 halftime lead. But a
determined Card defense shut the
Bears out for the rest of the
contest and brought the "Scrum
Axe" back to the Farm.
Stanford missed two penalty
kicks in the first half, so Stanford
coach Pete Kmetovic decided to
make a change, inserting Chris
Spieller in the lineup to handle
the kicking duties.
Spieller responded by booting
two out of three penalty kicks to
give the Cards a 6-3 victory. "I
really think we were fired up in
the second half," said Kmetovic.
"I hope some of this spirit will
carry over to Monterey."
The spirit that Kmetovic spoke
of had best carry over, for the
ruggers face an uphill battle in the
tournament. The Cards are in the
top bracket of the 32-team affair,
so if Stanford beats Montana in
the first round, the Cards will
probably face top-seeded Santa
Monica Rugby Club in the second
game.
Tournament rules provide for
three games the first day with the
top two teams meeting in the
finals the next day. The games are
shorter than regulation play, with
the first game 24 minutes long
and the other games slightly
longer.
Kmetovic feels that the kicking
game will be the key to a Stanford
victory, "We can't afford to miss
the easy kicks. Since the games
are shorter, we can't miss any
scoring opportunities." Kmetovic
is planning to use Spieller for the
kicking chores. "He seems to have
his confidence, so I'm going to go
with him," the coach said.
The Cards have not won the
tourney since 1971. Before that
they had run up a string of five
consecutive championships.
