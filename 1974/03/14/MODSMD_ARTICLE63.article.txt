# Riverside Tourney Approaches
## Cards Fight Hitting Recession 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Stanford's baseball team,
floundering in the midst of Phase
Two, hopes to break out of a
hitting recession next week at the
eighth annual Riverside
Tournament.
The Cards (5-11) began the
season tearing the cover off the
ball, averaging nearly eight runs
per game and batting almost .300
as a team. However, the pitching
staff during that period couldn't
find the plate so the Cards were
giving up more runs than they
could score.
Well, guess what? The pitching
has come around but take a look
at the slumping Stanford batting
average.
In the last eight games
(including a three-game series
against San Jose State last
weekend), Stanford pitching has
improved to such an extent that
the runs scored to runs allowed
ratio is nearly equal. However, the
batting statistics have dropped
considerably. Stanford was
batting .297 two weeks ago. Right
now the Cards have tailed off to
.252.
"The players are down a little
bit because of not hitting," said
head coach Ray Young. "We were
hitting the fast ball early in the
season. But now we're seeing a lot
of curve balls. The pitchers are
starting to catch up with the
hitters."
Tulane In Opener
Stanford takes on Tulane in
the first round of the Riverside
Tournament Monday. Then the
Cards play Wisconsin, UCLA,
Brigham Young, Oregon, Arizona
State and UC—Riverside
throughout the week.
The Cards finished second to
USC in the Gold Division last year
with a 4-3 mark. USC went on to
win the tournament with a 6-1
record. However, the Trojans are
not entered this year.
Stanford has won the
tournament twice, 1971 and
1972, beating Arizona State both
years. The Cards have won 20 out
of 30 games in the tourney.
Card shortstop Steve Davis,
who earned a spot on the
All-Tournament team as a
freshman last year, will try to
make it two straight.
"There are a lot of little things
that have to be worked out," said
Young. "I'm only trying to
approach them from the positive
side."
Baker Running
Sophomore catcher Dave Baker
leads the team in stolen bases

(6-10), hits (19) and average
(.328). He is second to Bob
Hampton in runs batted in with
11. Hampton has 12.
Stanford is just 11 stolen bases
short of matching last year's total
of 39. The Cards have stolen
safely 28 times in 42 attempts.
Against Santa Clara last week,
Stanford runners were thrown out
three straight times trying to steal.
"We came right back though,"
said Young. "We're still running
on our own trying to make the
other team make the play."
The pitching department's
figures have decreased
significantly in the earned run
average category. The staff E.R.A.
is down to 4.66 from 6.34 two
weeks ago.
"Our pitching will get nothing
but better," said Young. "It's
going to come together. I've got
to believe that."
Stanford 3, San Jose St. 1
Mike Williamson, who
currently leads the Cards in wins
(2-0) and E.R.A. (2.77), survived
a shaky start in the first inning,
giving up a run. Then he limited
the Spartans to just four hits in
going the route for a 3-1 victory
at San Jose Municipal Stadium
last Friday.
Gary Bei collected two hits to
lead the Card offense.
San Jose St. 7, Stanford 4
The Spartans came back on
Saturday to knock out Dave Frost
(2-2) in the sixth inning in a 7-4
win at Sunken Diamond.
San Jose tallied six runs off the
Stanford ace, who has a career
record of 12-2.
"Dave's back was just killing
him," said Baker. "The discs were
really grinding the hamburger."
Trailing 7-3 going into the
bottom of the seventh (last)
inning, the Cards loaded the bases
with no outs but could score only
once on a wild pitch.
San Jose St. 1, Stanford 0
In the nightcap, Bernie Hittner
looked fabulous, allowing just two
hits but losing a 1-0 heartbreaker
before 610 spectators.
The lone run Hittner gave up
was unearned. San Jose's Dave lus
walked in the third inning,
advanced to second on an error by
Kim Hannaford and scored on a
single by Mark Carroll.
The only Card chance to score
was in the fourth when Joe
Lamoure tripled to right center
field and to lead off the inning.
Then, he gambled on a sharp
ground ball to third base — but
was gunned down at the plate.

The Cards (5-11) began the
season tearing the cover off the
ball, averaging nearly eight runs
per game and batting almost .300
as a team. However, the pitching
staff during that period couldn't
find the plate so the Cards were
giving up more runs than they
could score.
Well, guess what? The pitching
has come around but take a look
at the slumping Stanford batting
average.
In the last eight games
(including a three-game series
against San Jose State last
weekend), Stanford pitching has
improved to such an extent that
the runs scored to runs allowed
ratio is nearly equal. However, the
batting statistics have dropped
considerably. Stanford was
batting .297 two weeks ago. Right
now the Cards have tailed off to
.252.
"The players are down a little
bit because of not hitting," said
head coach Ray Young. "We were
hitting the fast ball early in the
season. But now we're seeing a lot
of curve balls. The pitchers are
starting to catch up with the
hitters."
Tulane In Opener
Stanford takes on Tulane in
the first round of the Riverside
Tournament Monday. Then the
Cards play Wisconsin, UCLA,
Brigham Young, Oregon, Arizona
State and UC—Riverside
throughout the week.
The Cards finished second to
USC in the Gold Division last year
with a 4-3 mark. USC went on to
win the tournament with a 6-1
record. However, the Trojans are
not entered this year.
Stanford has won the
tournament twice, 1971 and
1972, beating Arizona State both
years. The Cards have won 20 out
of 30 games in the tourney.
Card shortstop Steve Davis,
who earned a spot on the
All-Tournament team as a
freshman last year, will try to
make it two straight.
"There are a lot of little things
that have to be worked out," said
Young. "I'm only trying to
approach them from the positive
side."
Baker Running
Sophomore catcher Dave Baker
leads the team in stolen bases

(6-10), hits (19) and average
(.328). He is second to Bob
Hampton in runs batted in with
11. Hampton has 12.
Stanford is just 11 stolen bases
short of matching last year's total
of 39. The Cards have stolen
safely 28 times in 42 attempts.
Against Santa Clara last week,
Stanford runners were thrown out
three straight times trying to steal.
"We came right back though,"
said Young. "We're still running
on our own trying to make the
other team make the play."
The pitching department's
figures have decreased
significantly in the earned run
average category. The staff E.R.A.
is down to 4.66 from 6.34 two
weeks ago.
"Our pitching will get nothing
but better," said Young. "It's
going to come together. I've got
to believe that."
Stanford 3, San Jose St. 1
Mike Williamson, who
currently leads the Cards in wins
(2-0) and E.R.A. (2.77), survived
a shaky start in the first inning,
giving up a run. Then he limited
the Spartans to just four hits in
going the route for a 3-1 victory
at San Jose Municipal Stadium
last Friday.
Gary Bei collected two hits to
lead the Card offense.
San Jose St. 7, Stanford 4
The Spartans came back on
Saturday to knock out Dave Frost
(2-2) in the sixth inning in a 7-4
win at Sunken Diamond.
San Jose tallied six runs off the
Stanford ace, who has a career
record of 12-2.
"Dave's back was just killing
him," said Baker. "The discs were
really grinding the hamburger."
Trailing 7-3 going into the
bottom of the seventh (last)
inning, the Cards loaded the bases
with no outs but could score only
once on a wild pitch.
San Jose St. 1, Stanford 0
In the nightcap, Bernie Hittner
looked fabulous, allowing just two
hits but losing a 1-0 heartbreaker
before 610 spectators.
The lone run Hittner gave up
was unearned. San Jose's Dave lus
walked in the third inning,
advanced to second on an error by
Kim Hannaford and scored on a
single by Mark Carroll.
The only Card chance to score
was in the fourth when Joe
Lamoure tripled to right center
field and to lead off the inning.
Then, he gambled on a sharp
ground ball to third base — but
was gunned down at the plate.

find the plate so the Cards were
giving up more runs than they
could score.
Well, guess what? The pitching
has come around but take a look
at the slumping Stanford batting
average.
In the last eight games
(including a three-game series
against San Jose State last
weekend), Stanford pitching has
improved to such an extent that
the runs scored to runs allowed
ratio is nearly equal. However, the
batting statistics have dropped
considerably. Stanford was
batting .297 two weeks ago. Right
now the Cards have tailed off to
.252.
"The players are down a little
bit because of not hitting," said
head coach Ray Young. "We were
hitting the fast ball early in the
season. But now we're seeing a lot
of curve balls. The pitchers are
starting to catch up with the
hitters."
Tulane In Opener
Stanford takes on Tulane in
the first round of the Riverside
Tournament Monday. Then the
Cards play Wisconsin, UCLA,
Brigham Young, Oregon, Arizona
State and UC—Riverside
throughout the week.
The Cards finished second to
USC in the Gold Division last year
with a 4-3 mark. USC went on to
win the tournament with a 6-1
record. However, the Trojans are
not entered this year.
Stanford has won the
tournament twice, 1971 and
1972, beating Arizona State both
years. The Cards have won 20 out
of 30 games in the tourney.
Card shortstop Steve Davis,
who earned a spot on the
All-Tournament team as a
freshman last year, will try to
make it two straight.
"There are a lot of little things
that have to be worked out," said
Young. "I'm only trying to
approach them from the positive
side."
Baker Running
Sophomore catcher Dave Baker
leads the team in stolen bases

(6-10), hits (19) and average
(.328). He is second to Bob
Hampton in runs batted in with
11. Hampton has 12.
Stanford is just 11 stolen bases
short of matching last year's total
of 39. The Cards have stolen
safely 28 times in 42 attempts.
Against Santa Clara last week,
Stanford runners were thrown out
three straight times trying to steal.
"We came right back though,"
said Young. "We're still running
on our own trying to make the
other team make the play."
The pitching department's
figures have decreased
significantly in the earned run
average category. The staff E.R.A.
is down to 4.66 from 6.34 two
weeks ago.
"Our pitching will get nothing
but better," said Young. "It's
going to come together. I've got
to believe that."
Stanford 3, San Jose St. 1
Mike Williamson, who
currently leads the Cards in wins
(2-0) and E.R.A. (2.77), survived
a shaky start in the first inning,
giving up a run. Then he limited
the Spartans to just four hits in
going the route for a 3-1 victory
at San Jose Municipal Stadium
last Friday.
Gary Bei collected two hits to
lead the Card offense.
San Jose St. 7, Stanford 4
The Spartans came back on
Saturday to knock out Dave Frost
(2-2) in the sixth inning in a 7-4
win at Sunken Diamond.
San Jose tallied six runs off the
Stanford ace, who has a career
record of 12-2.
"Dave's back was just killing
him," said Baker. "The discs were
really grinding the hamburger."
Trailing 7-3 going into the
bottom of the seventh (last)
inning, the Cards loaded the bases
with no outs but could score only
once on a wild pitch.
San Jose St. 1, Stanford 0
In the nightcap, Bernie Hittner
looked fabulous, allowing just two
hits but losing a 1-0 heartbreaker
before 610 spectators.
The lone run Hittner gave up
was unearned. San Jose's Dave lus
walked in the third inning,
advanced to second on an error by
Kim Hannaford and scored on a
single by Mark Carroll.
The only Card chance to score
was in the fourth when Joe
Lamoure tripled to right center
field and to lead off the inning.
Then, he gambled on a sharp
ground ball to third base — but
was gunned down at the plate.
