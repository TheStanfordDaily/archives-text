# 'Maximum Performances' Not Enough
## Spartans Defeat Spirited Spikers 
### MARK WHITE 
SAN JOSE—Stanford's track
team failed to pull off an upset,
but the Cards gave track
powerhouse San Jose State a
spirited fight before succumbing
to the stronger Spartans 85-60
Saturday. Individual Cardinals
established seven lifetime bests in
tuning up for the highly
competitive Easter Relays to be
held March 23 in Santa Barbara.
"It was the best performance
we could expect," said Stanford
coach Payton Jordan. "We got
maximum performances from
several men, and this is
represented in the number of
lifetime bests we got. We were
outmanned, but we were not
out-competed.
"For us the standout of the
meet was Matt Hogsett. He ran his
best today. I also liked the
competitive toughness of [sprinter
Marvin] Holmes; he comes to
run."
Hogsett, a sophomore from
Newport Harbor, shaved over a
second off his previous best in the
440 intermediate hurdles, winning
in an excellent 51.7 — the second
fastest in Stanford history.
San Jose State's Lloyd Kaster
took the lead at the 330 mark on
the backstretch, but gave way to a
late surge by Hogsett after the
final hurdle. Stanford's Dave
Bagshaw was close behind in
third, also running a lifetime best.
Bagshaw's 52.2 places him two
notches behind Hogsett at fourth
on the all-time Stanford list.
Blistering Leg
Forty-five minutes later
Hogsett opened the mile relay
with a blistering 48.6 leg. Hogsett
made up the difference in the
staggered lanes after running 150
yards, and passed a 30-yard lead
to Ken Kring on the first baton
exchange. Kring and third man
John Kessel had trouble with the
second exchange, but Kessel went
on to lengthen Stanford's lead to
40 yards. Freshman Scott Wingo
breezed to victory on the final leg
as the Cards established a season
best 3:15.3.
Another Cardinal who rose to
Spartan challenges in two races
was Marvin Holmes. Holmes came
back from fourth place at the
75-yard mark in the 100-yard

dash to close for a second behind
SJS NCAA finalist Vince Briddell,
who won in 9.8 going into a wind.
In the 220 Holmes got an
unusually decent start and led
most of the race until a late burst
by Briddell nipped him by a foot.
Both were timed in 21.7.
Possibly the best race of the
day followed the 220. Marc
Genet, a sophomore who was
ineligible for the meet and hence
ran unattached, won a personal
duel with Stanford's Tony
Sandoval when he ran the fastest
two-mile for SJS in 10 years.
Couldn't Shake Genet
Sandoval took over the lead
from teammate Mark McConnell
on the third lap en route to a 4:26
first mile in which he tried to
break contact with the field. But
Sandy could not shake Genet,
who pulled up on Sandoval's
shoulder at the beginning of the
sixth lap.
"I let him (Sandoval] do all
the work", Genet said afterwords.
"I had to hang with him, so I just
leached off him."
Sandoval's attempts to pull
away from Genet failed, and as
they entered the final lap the pair
was neck and neck. Genet then
kicked home with a 63-second
final quarter, which left Sandy
behind by 35 yards. Genet's 8:51
was among the four best times
recorded for SJS. Sandy's 8:56.2
was also a personal best, and
placed him second on the all-time
Stanford list. McConnel finished
third with a lifetime best in third
at 8:56.6.
'Unsung Heroes'
In the field events, three
Cardinals established lifetime
Standards. Steady senior Jim
Royer won the discus in 166-5,
one inch better than his mark of
last year. Mike Hall, described by
close team observers as "an
unsung hero," continued his
valuable development with a
lifetime best 48-5 in the triple
jump for second place. Hall also
came up with needed points in the
long jump with a 22-8 leap, good
for second.
Steve Hopkins continued his
mastery in the javelin with a
victory sling of 214-0. Freshman
John Olenchalk showed more

progress in the shotput, taking
second at 48-9'/2, also a personal
best. Tom Banducci nabbed thirds
in both the javelin and shotput.
Kring took second in the pole
vault at 14-0.
Vernell Jackson showed he was
rounding into good condition
when he ran a steady 1:53.0,
tying his lifetime best in the 880
for second place. Spartan Chris
Giannoulas finished strong at
1:52.3 to win. Bagshaw and
Wingo also picked up seconds in
their specialties, Bagshaw closing
fast in the 120 high in 14.6
behind undefeated Spartan Greg
Tinnin, while Wingo was
outkicked by SJS's Tom Sprink in
the 440.

40 yards. Freshman Scott Wingo
breezed to victory on the final leg
as the Cards established a season
best 3:15.3.
Another Cardinal who rose to
Spartan challenges in two races
was Marvin Holmes. Holmes came
back from fourth place at the
75-yard mark in the 100-yard

dash to close for a second behind
SJS NCAA finalist Vince Briddell,
who won in 9.8 going into a wind.
In the 220 Holmes got an
unusually decent start and led
most of the race until a late burst
by Briddell nipped him by a foot.
Both were timed in 21.7.
Possibly the best race of the
day followed the 220. Marc
Genet, a sophomore who was
ineligible for the meet and hence
ran unattached, won a personal
duel with Stanford's Tony
Sandoval when he ran the fastest
two-mile for SJS in 10 years.
Couldn't Shake Genet
Sandoval took over the lead
from teammate Mark McConnell
on the third lap en route to a 4:26
first mile in which he tried to
break contact with the field. But
Sandy could not shake Genet,
who pulled up on Sandoval's
shoulder at the beginning of the
sixth lap.
"I let him (Sandoval] do all
the work", Genet said afterwords.
"I had to hang with him, so I just
leached off him."
Sandoval's attempts to pull
away from Genet failed, and as
they entered the final lap the pair
was neck and neck. Genet then
kicked home with a 63-second
final quarter, which left Sandy
behind by 35 yards. Genet's 8:51
was among the four best times
recorded for SJS. Sandy's 8:56.2
was also a personal best, and
placed him second on the all-time
Stanford list. McConnel finished
third with a lifetime best in third
at 8:56.6.
'Unsung Heroes'
In the field events, three
Cardinals established lifetime
Standards. Steady senior Jim
Royer won the discus in 166-5,
one inch better than his mark of
last year. Mike Hall, described by
close team observers as "an
unsung hero," continued his
valuable development with a
lifetime best 48-5 in the triple
jump for second place. Hall also
came up with needed points in the
long jump with a 22-8 leap, good
for second.
Steve Hopkins continued his
mastery in the javelin with a
victory sling of 214-0. Freshman
John Olenchalk showed more

progress in the shotput, taking
second at 48-9'/2, also a personal
best. Tom Banducci nabbed thirds
in both the javelin and shotput.
Kring took second in the pole
vault at 14-0.
Vernell Jackson showed he was
rounding into good condition
when he ran a steady 1:53.0,
tying his lifetime best in the 880
for second place. Spartan Chris
Giannoulas finished strong at
1:52.3 to win. Bagshaw and
Wingo also picked up seconds in
their specialties, Bagshaw closing
fast in the 120 high in 14.6
behind undefeated Spartan Greg
Tinnin, while Wingo was
outkicked by SJS's Tom Sprink in
the 440.

440 intermediate hurdles, winning
in an excellent 51.7 — the second

third with a lifetime best in third
at 8:56.6.
'Unsung Heroes'
In the field events, three
Cardinals established lifetime
Standards. Steady senior Jim
Royer won the discus in 166-5,
one inch better than his mark of
last year. Mike Hall, described by
close team observers as "an
unsung hero," continued his
valuable development with a
lifetime best 48-5 in the triple
jump for second place. Hall also
came up with needed points in the
long jump with a 22-8 leap, good
for second.
Steve Hopkins continued his
mastery in the javelin with a
victory sling of 214-0. Freshman
John Olenchalk showed more

progress in the shotput, taking
second at 48-9'/2, also a personal
best. Tom Banducci nabbed thirds
in both the javelin and shotput.
Kring took second in the pole
vault at 14-0.
Vernell Jackson showed he was
rounding into good condition
when he ran a steady 1:53.0,
tying his lifetime best in the 880
for second place. Spartan Chris
Giannoulas finished strong at
1:52.3 to win. Bagshaw and
Wingo also picked up seconds in
their specialties, Bagshaw closing
fast in the 120 high in 14.6
behind undefeated Spartan Greg
Tinnin, while Wingo was
outkicked by SJS's Tom Sprink in
the 440.

Track Notes: Jordan will lead a
20-man contingent to the Easter
Relays at Santa Barbara in nine
days. Of the major track powers
competing— USC, Cal and
Washington— Jordan feels the
Trojans should be favored.
Sprinter Otto Rossner, who has
been recuperating from a pulled
hamstring, will be slated to enter
the sprints with teammates
Holmes and Ken Curl.
Those three will have their
hands full, however, against San
Diego State's Steve Williams.
Williams, who ran an easy 9.3
century dash last week, co-world
record-holder in the event at 9.1.
SAN JOSE—Stanford's track
team failed to pull off an upset,
but the Cards gave track
powerhouse San Jose State a
spirited fight before succumbing
to the stronger Spartans 85-60
Saturday. Individual Cardinals
established seven lifetime bests in
tuning up for the highly
competitive Easter Relays to be
held March 23 in Santa Barbara.
"It was the best performance
we could expect," said Stanford
coach Payton Jordan. "We got
maximum performances from
several men, and this is
represented in the number of
lifetime bests we got. We were
outmanned, but we were not
out-competed.
"For us the standout of the
meet was Matt Hogsett. He ran his
best today. I also liked the
competitive toughness of [sprinter
Marvin] Holmes; he comes to
run."
Hogsett, a sophomore from
Newport Harbor, shaved over a
second off his previous best in the
440 intermediate hurdles, winning
in an excellent 51.7 — the second
fastest in Stanford history.
San Jose State's Lloyd Kaster
took the lead at the 330 mark on
the backstretch, but gave way to a
late surge by Hogsett after the
final hurdle. Stanford's Dave
Bagshaw was close behind in
third, also running a lifetime best.
Bagshaw's 52.2 places him two
notches behind Hogsett at fourth
on the all-time Stanford list.
Blistering Leg
Forty-five minutes later
Hogsett opened the mile relay
with a blistering 48.6 leg. Hogsett
made up the difference in the
staggered lanes after running 150
yards, and passed a 30-yard lead
to Ken Kring on the first baton
exchange. Kring and third man
John Kessel had trouble with the
second exchange, but Kessel went
on to lengthen Stanford's lead to
40 yards. Freshman Scott Wingo
breezed to victory on the final leg
as the Cards established a season
best 3:15.3.
Another Cardinal who rose to
Spartan challenges in two races
was Marvin Holmes. Holmes came
back from fourth place at the
75-yard mark in the 100-yard

dash to close for a second behind
SJS NCAA finalist Vince Briddell,
who won in 9.8 going into a wind.
In the 220 Holmes got an
unusually decent start and led
most of the race until a late burst
by Briddell nipped him by a foot.
Both were timed in 21.7.
Possibly the best race of the
day followed the 220. Marc
Genet, a sophomore who was
ineligible for the meet and hence
ran unattached, won a personal
duel with Stanford's Tony
Sandoval when he ran the fastest
two-mile for SJS in 10 years.
Couldn't Shake Genet
Sandoval took over the lead
from teammate Mark McConnell
on the third lap en route to a 4:26
first mile in which he tried to
break contact with the field. But
Sandy could not shake Genet,
who pulled up on Sandoval's
shoulder at the beginning of the
sixth lap.
"I let him (Sandoval] do all
the work", Genet said afterwords.
"I had to hang with him, so I just
leached off him."
Sandoval's attempts to pull
away from Genet failed, and as
they entered the final lap the pair
was neck and neck. Genet then
kicked home with a 63-second
final quarter, which left Sandy
behind by 35 yards. Genet's 8:51
was among the four best times
recorded for SJS. Sandy's 8:56.2
was also a personal best, and
placed him second on the all-time
Stanford list. McConnel finished
third with a lifetime best in third
at 8:56.6.
