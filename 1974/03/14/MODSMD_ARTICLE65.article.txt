# Recruiting Ends, New Search Begins
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Just as Stanford football coach Jack Christiansen concluded one
search — the one for new talent to put on the field — he's had to begin
another.
Stanford announced Tuesday the list of the 17 high school and
nine junior college recruits who've signed letters of intent to come
here next fall. But the school must now find a new linebacker coach
following the resignation of Ray Handley, also announced on
Tuesday.
"You'd have to say we were pleased by our recruiting this year,"
Christiansen said of the group, which includes three high school
All-Americans. "As usual, we got a few people USC and UCLA were
after, and we lost a few."
The three All-Americans are Ray Cardinalli, a 5-11, 210 pound

linebacker from Monterey High
School; James Lofton (6-3, 180),
a receiver and defensive back from
Washington High School in Los
Angeles; and Dan McCann (6-3,
220), a linebacker from North
Hollywood High School.
The remaining signees include
players at nearly all positions,
with all but two of the JC
transfers being linemen. Of the
total of 26 recruits, all but five are
from California.
The departure of Handley took
place after he was offered a head
coaching position at the new Reed
High School in his home town of
Reno. Handley came here in 1971
as a graduate assistant following a
year as an assistant coach at Reno
High School, and stayed at
Stanford to be linebacker coach
this past two seasons.
Handley was a star running
back at Stanford 1963-65 and will
receive his master's degree in June.
"We're really sorry to lose Ray,"
Christiansen said.
Christiansen hopes to find a
replacement for Handley within
the next couple of weeks.
Otherwise, JV coach Gunther
Cunningham will take Handley's
place during spring drills, which
begin April 6.
In other Stanford football
news, quarterback Mike Boryla
has signed a multi-year contract
with the Philadelphia Eagles of
the NFL. The Eagles obtained the
rights to Boryla in a trade with
the Cincinnati Bengals last week.
Boryla was a fourth-round
choice of the Bengals as well as a
first-round choice of the New
York franchise in the fledgling
World Football League. He chose
the NFL because "I want to play
with the best and against the
best."
The only other announced
signing so far is of center Bill Reid
with the Southern California Sun
of the WFL. Former Stanford
linebacker Don Parish, who has
played with three NFL clubs, has
also signed with the Sun.

Stanford announced Tuesday the list of the 17 high school and
nine junior college recruits who've signed letters of intent to come
here next fall. But the school must now find a new linebacker coach
following the resignation of Ray Handley, also announced on
Tuesday.
"You'd have to say we were pleased by our recruiting this year,"
Christiansen said of the group, which includes three high school
All-Americans. "As usual, we got a few people USC and UCLA were
after, and we lost a few."
The three All-Americans are Ray Cardinalli, a 5-11, 210 pound

linebacker from Monterey High
School; James Lofton (6-3, 180),
a receiver and defensive back from
Washington High School in Los
Angeles; and Dan McCann (6-3,
220), a linebacker from North
Hollywood High School.
The remaining signees include
players at nearly all positions,
with all but two of the JC
transfers being linemen. Of the
total of 26 recruits, all but five are
from California.
The departure of Handley took
place after he was offered a head
coaching position at the new Reed
High School in his home town of
Reno. Handley came here in 1971
as a graduate assistant following a
year as an assistant coach at Reno
High School, and stayed at
Stanford to be linebacker coach
this past two seasons.
Handley was a star running
back at Stanford 1963-65 and will
receive his master's degree in June.
"We're really sorry to lose Ray,"
Christiansen said.
Christiansen hopes to find a
replacement for Handley within
the next couple of weeks.
Otherwise, JV coach Gunther
Cunningham will take Handley's
place during spring drills, which
begin April 6.
In other Stanford football
news, quarterback Mike Boryla
has signed a multi-year contract
with the Philadelphia Eagles of
the NFL. The Eagles obtained the
rights to Boryla in a trade with
the Cincinnati Bengals last week.
Boryla was a fourth-round
choice of the Bengals as well as a
first-round choice of the New
York franchise in the fledgling
World Football League. He chose
the NFL because "I want to play
with the best and against the
best."
The only other announced
signing so far is of center Bill Reid
with the Southern California Sun
of the WFL. Former Stanford
linebacker Don Parish, who has
played with three NFL clubs, has
also signed with the Sun.
Just as Stanford football coach Jack Christiansen concluded one
search — the one for new talent to put on the field — he's had to begin
another.
