# Trojan Duo Slops Cards In Net Final
## 
### 
For Stanford's doubles team of
Pat DuPre-John Whitlinger, last
weekend marked a strange turn of
events.
Last year, DuPre-Whitlinger
almost singlehandedly won the
Ojai tournament for Stanford by
beating Sashi Menon-John
Andrews of USC in the semifinals
of the tournament.
Then, later in the year,
DuPre-Whitlinger contributed
heavily to the downfall of
Stanford in the Pacific Eight
meet, losing to Brian
Teacher-Steve Mott of UCLA.
It was just the opposite last
weekend in the 85th Pacific Coast
Doubles Tournament at LaJolla.
DuPre-Whitlinger avenged their
defeat to Teacher-Mott, beating
them 7-6, 6-1, 5-7, 7-6 in the
semifinals.
But then Menon-Andrews
avenged themselves against Whit
and Dupes, beating them
decisively, 6-2, 7-6, 6-2 in the
finals.
Previously, the two Los
Angeles teams had eliminated
both other Stanford entries in the
LaJolla tourney. Mott-Teacher
downed Stanford's newest team,
Mark Mitchell-Gene Mayer, in the
first round by a 6-4, 6-1, 6-3
score.
Menon-Andrews took care of
Chico Hagey-Chip Fisher in a
semifinal straight-set match, 6-4,
6-1, 6-3.
In other Stanford tennis action
last weekend, freshman Nick
Saviano reached the finals of the
Camellia Festival Tournament in
Sacramento, bowing to Alex
Olmedo of Beverly Hills 3-6, 7-5,
6-4 in the finals
