# Despite Poor Pac-8 Showing
## Swimmers 'On Schedule' 
### STEVE BAKER 
In something of a disappointment, Stanford's
swimming team placed fifth at the Pacific Eight
championships in Seattle last weekend. The Cards
trailed USC, Washington, UCLA and Oregon.
While their performances might seem
discouraging, the swimmers aren't panicking. Coach
Jim Gaughran's team swam through the conference
meet in anticipation of the NCAA's. "We're right
on schedule," Gaughran said confidently.
Those swimmers who had already qualified for
the nationals worked out each day before the meet.
Gaughran indicated that many swimmers from
other schools peaked for the Pac-B's. This
combination of a tired squad facing well-rested and
psyched opposition resulted in the Cards'
unsatisfying finish.
One individual, however, defied all analysis at
the conference meet. The amazing John Hencken,
in the best swim meet of his collegiate career, broke
two American records in the 100 and 200-yard
breaststroke. Clocking a 56.23 in the 100 and a
2:02.00 in the 200, the sophomore superstar easily
won both races.
While the Pac-B's aren't that important, Hencken
said, he felt relaxed and ready. "There wasn't a
need to go fast, but I wanted to."
John didn't limit himself to the breaststroke
events. In the 200 individual medley, he recorded
his best time (1:54.03), set a new school record and
placed second behind Washington's Stan Carper. In
the 400-yard medley relay, he split a 55.8.
Other Cards did well at the meet. The distance
men, Steve Strong and Terry Sutton, had good
times in the 1650. Strong swam a 16:17.12 while
Sutton placed seventh in 16:09.64. Rick Gebers

placed sixth in the 100 backstroke and Dave
Fairbank took second in the 50 free (21.18) and
third in the 100 free (46.31). Paul Clark was
exceptional in the 200 fly.
Now the swimmers are confronted with the
NCAA's in Long Beach. Two weeks from today is
the culmination of their entire season. At the
NCAA's everything is on the line. There will be no
holding back. Everybody will be peaked.
Stanford, rated sixth in the nation, will be
hoping to improve on its sixth place finish of last
year. Gaughran said, "We're trying to get third
place. The toughest of the top teams to beat are
Washington, Tennessee and UCLA."
Whatever the outcome between these teams, the
battle for first will be between Indiana and USC.
The Hoosiers, winners of the NCAA crown for six
consecutive years, are favored to win again this
year. But a strong group of Trojan freshmen may
pose a serious threat to Indiana.
Stanford's hopes will be resting on each
individual. Hencken, Fairbank and the relays
should provide the bulk of the attack as they have
all year. The efforts of Strong, Sutton and Craig
Van Zandt in the distances and Rick Gebers and
Randy Whitchurch in the backstroke will be
important as well. Sprinters Dean Anderson, Bruce
Goodwin and Martin Pedley, and individual
medleyist Paul Clark could also provide some
essential points.
It is not often that each individual of a team
performs his best at the same meet. Stanford has
gotten that total team effort several times this year,
including the successful dual meets against
Washington and UCLA. The Cards will need one
again at the NCAA's.
