# Placement Center Head Hopeful Despite Job Crunch
## 
### JEFFREY HALL 
Director of Career Planning and
Placement Ralph Keller is "optimistic"
about job opportunities for this year's
Stanford graduates, although he
warned that those entering the job
market will face "a severe economic
crunch that will extend into the next
decade."
He reported that during the 19705,
approximately 10 million new college
graduates will enter the labor market,
but that only 3.3 million will leave the
labor force as a result of retirement or
other reasons.
Minority graduates will also be
critically affected, Keller told a section
meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science last
week in San Francisco, because their
career goals will put them into direct
competition with whites in fields
where the competition is already
fierce, such as medicine and law.
Keller noted that currently,
non-white students aspire to more
years of education than whites. Thus,
minority graduates "may become the
victims of a new set of societal
frustrations brought on by
unemployment among college
graduates."
Salvador Sanchez, special assistant
to President Lyman and former
assistant to the President for chicano
affairs, agreed that things are "getting
tougher all the time." Getting the ideal
job will be harder for minorities, he
said.
lighter Market
'There is a tighter market, no
doubt about it,"he continued.

Securing jobs might not be too
difficult, Sanchez concluded, "but
whether or not minorities can enter
the level where high-level decisions are
made is another question."
Keller observed that black students
have shown little interest in
engineering, which he called
"unfortunate." He said a shortage of
engineers is predicted, and less than

one percent of U.S. engineers are now
blacks. He attributed this to
inadequate preparation in math and
science while in high school.
A national study of 30,000
non-white students who graduated in
1965 and 1970 revealed that career
interests among minorities shifted
significantly toward the professions,
while those of whites remained steady.
'Exceptionally WelP
Last year's Stanford graduates as a
whole did "exceptionally well" in the
job market, according to Keller.
Placements increased 16 percent over
the previous year.
While nationally there was a
decrease of nine percent in the
placement of liberal arts graduates
(from 47 percent to 38 percent),
Stanford was able to place 56 percent
of its liberal arts students who sought
the aid of the center.
The number of college degrees
conferred have increased five times
since 1940, Keller said. However, there
has only been an 18 percent increase
in the sorts of jobs thought suitable
for college graduates.
'Hiring Down'
Part of the problem is that firms are
"hiring down," that is, hiring people
with only a high school or community
college-level education. A recent study
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
showed that "a high school education
will be sufficient for eight out of 10
jobs" that will be opening up in the
coming years.
One reason why Stanford graduates
have fared better than the national
average, asserted Keller, is that

"Stanford picks primarily students
who will succeed."
"The quality of the student body is
high," he claimed, and "students are
exposed to an excellent faculty."
'Hoover Tower Syndrome'
According to Keller, one problem
group in terms of placement are those
graduates who suffer from the
"Hoover Tower Syndrome" â€”
students "who don't want to leave the
shadow of it." There are limited
opportunities in this area, he said, and
students who seek jobs away from the
Peninsula will have more luck.
Keller said that in today's world a
person needs some training in
numerical skills, as well as competency
in the use of the English language.
"My only gripe," he said, "is that too
many students specialize in one
narrow area, while they should be
educating themselves more generally."

Economics classes are very variable, he
said, and added that a student should
know some basic psychology.
Outlook Mixed
On the graduate level, there is a
mixed outlook. Arjay Miller, dean of
the Graduate School of Business, said
"things are still looking great for us."
To date, 206 companies have signed
up with the business school to recruit
graduates, Miller noted. This compares
to 185 last year. "Companies facing
less prosperous times tend to recruit at
fewer schools, but Stanford will still
be on that list."
The School of Education has also
been able to report success in placing
its graduates despite a national
oversupply of teachers.
Keller remarked that Stanford's
poorest performance in the job market
was among doctoral candidates who
didn't finish their dissertations.
