The March 7 Daily editorial
about KZSU was based on at least
two factual errors that could have
been avoided had the Daily
editorial writers read their own
files. The editorial discusses
KZSU's 1972-73 fee assessment,
which brought the station about
$39,500.
The most prominent error is to
say that KZSU should not have
asked for student money until we
had the power increase that the
money was to finance. There are
two problems.
First, we had to have the
money in hand before we could
ask for more power. We had to be
able to show the FCC that we had
the money to do what we were
asking for. Second, even had we
been able to wait until we had
approval to ask for the money, we
only needed about $3500. Fee
assessments come in $11,000
increments. The university
computers won't let us ask for
only 25 cents from each student.
So we couldn't have done it the
way the Daily suggests, even had
it been legal.
The Daily knew all this in 1972
when they endorsed our fee
assessment. They understood then
that higher power was not a sure
thing, but they also understood
that there was no other way.
Believe me, KZSU is not happy
that an old campaign promise is
unfilled. But the Daily's current
suggestion that we should have
waited for approval before asking
for money is both illegal and
impractical.
Wrong Implication
The second big error is to say
that the 1972 fee assessment was
only for going to a higher power
and for converting to stereo. The
implication is that, because we
haven't received a power increase,
half of the money has been
wasted, and the students deceived.
In fact, as the Daily reported at
the time, and has often reported
since, about $18,000 (46 percent)
went to operating expenses for
1972-73. Another $18,000 went
to converting to stereo (we had to
rewire the entire station, buy
stereo equipment, etc.). Only
about $3500, or about seven
percent, went to the costs of
higher power. This information
was presented to the students in
1972, and the Daily had that
information when they endorsed
our 1972 fee referendum.
The Daily asks, "Would
students have voted through
$39,000 simply for the station to
go stereo?" The students knew
then, if they cared, that most of
the money was going for
operating expenses and stereo. We
did not deceive them. Had the

Daily editorialist checked his files
he would realize that we hadn't
deceived the Daily, either.
Money Needed
Furthermore, KZSU was well
aware in 1972 that we might not
receive a power increase. That
question came up at the meeting
in which the Daily decided to
endorse our fee assessment. The
Daily was aware then, but
apparently has now forgotten,
that we had to have the money in
hand before we could ask the FCC
for more power. They were aware
then, but have forgotten now,
that higher power was a relatively
small portion of the fee
assessment package.
KZSU has made mistakes,
certainly. In retrospect, it now
appears that it may have been a
mistake to purchase the $3500 of
equipment for higher power.At the
time, it looked like a good
decision. It turns out that the
FCC had been wrong when they
accepted our application last
March, an event that virtually
always means approval. But we
had no way of knowing that they
had been wrong.
At the time, with the
information that we had, buying
the equipment was a good
decision, one that will save us over
$1000 should we yet get a power
increase.
However, to imply that KZSU
deceived the students in 1972 is
just plain wrong. It implies that
the Daily helped deceive the
students by endorsing us, yet
nowhere in last week's editorial
did the Daily admit its own
previous errors.
Money Not Wasted
Just as it is impossible to
collect only 25 cents from each
student, so it is impossible for us
to return 25 cents to each
student. The money has not been
wasted. The $3500 equipment is
currently unused, but we will sell
it if it ever becomes apparent that
we will never be able to use it.
The only way we can pay back
the students is through an
improvement in our services. If we
have to sell our new equipment,
you may rest assured that the
money will not be squandered.
Next month KZSU will be
asking for a fee assessment for
1974-75, for $20,000, like the
one that students are currently
paying. This money will cover our
basic operating expenses.When the
voters look at our request, I hope
that they will judge it on its
merits, not on the basis of the
misinformation included in last
week's editorial.

$39,500.
The most prominent error is to
say that KZSU should not have
asked for student money until we
had the power increase that the
money was to finance. There are
two problems.
First, we had to have the
money in hand before we could
ask for more power. We had to be
able to show the FCC that we had
the money to do what we were
asking for. Second, even had we
been able to wait until we had
approval to ask for the money, we
only needed about $3500. Fee
assessments come in $11,000
increments. The university
computers won't let us ask for
only 25 cents from each student.
So we couldn't have done it the
way the Daily suggests, even had
it been legal.
The Daily knew all this in 1972
when they endorsed our fee
assessment. They understood then
that higher power was not a sure
thing, but they also understood
that there was no other way.
Believe me, KZSU is not happy
that an old campaign promise is
unfilled. But the Daily's current
suggestion that we should have
waited for approval before asking
for money is both illegal and
impractical.
Wrong Implication
The second big error is to say
that the 1972 fee assessment was
only for going to a higher power
and for converting to stereo. The
implication is that, because we
haven't received a power increase,
half of the money has been
wasted, and the students deceived.
In fact, as the Daily reported at
the time, and has often reported
since, about $18,000 (46 percent)
went to operating expenses for
1972-73. Another $18,000 went
to converting to stereo (we had to
rewire the entire station, buy
stereo equipment, etc.). Only
about $3500, or about seven
percent, went to the costs of
higher power. This information
was presented to the students in
1972, and the Daily had that
information when they endorsed
our 1972 fee referendum.
The Daily asks, "Would
students have voted through
$39,000 simply for the station to
go stereo?" The students knew
then, if they cared, that most of
the money was going for
operating expenses and stereo. We
did not deceive them. Had the

Daily editorialist checked his files
he would realize that we hadn't
deceived the Daily, either.
Money Needed
Furthermore, KZSU was well
aware in 1972 that we might not
receive a power increase. That
question came up at the meeting
in which the Daily decided to
endorse our fee assessment. The
Daily was aware then, but
apparently has now forgotten,
that we had to have the money in
hand before we could ask the FCC
for more power. They were aware
then, but have forgotten now,
that higher power was a relatively
small portion of the fee
assessment package.
KZSU has made mistakes,
certainly. In retrospect, it now
appears that it may have been a
mistake to purchase the $3500 of
equipment for higher power.At the
time, it looked like a good
decision. It turns out that the
FCC had been wrong when they
accepted our application last
March, an event that virtually
always means approval. But we
had no way of knowing that they
had been wrong.
At the time, with the
information that we had, buying
the equipment was a good
decision, one that will save us over
$1000 should we yet get a power
increase.
However, to imply that KZSU
deceived the students in 1972 is
just plain wrong. It implies that
the Daily helped deceive the
students by endorsing us, yet
nowhere in last week's editorial
did the Daily admit its own
previous errors.
Money Not Wasted
Just as it is impossible to
collect only 25 cents from each
student, so it is impossible for us
to return 25 cents to each
student. The money has not been
wasted. The $3500 equipment is
currently unused, but we will sell
it if it ever becomes apparent that
we will never be able to use it.
The only way we can pay back
the students is through an
improvement in our services. If we
have to sell our new equipment,
you may rest assured that the
money will not be squandered.
Next month KZSU will be
asking for a fee assessment for
1974-75, for $20,000, like the
one that students are currently
paying. This money will cover our
basic operating expenses.When the
voters look at our request, I hope
that they will judge it on its
merits, not on the basis of the
misinformation included in last
week's editorial.

money in hand before we could
ask for more power. We had to be
able to show the FCC that we had
the money to do what we were
asking for. Second, even had we
been able to wait until we had
approval to ask for the money, we
only needed about $3500. Fee
assessments come in $11,000
increments. The university
computers won't let us ask for
only 25 cents from each student.
So we couldn't have done it the
way the Daily suggests, even had
it been legal.
The Daily knew all this in 1972
when they endorsed our fee
assessment. They understood then
that higher power was not a sure
thing, but they also understood
that there was no other way.
Believe me, KZSU is not happy
that an old campaign promise is
unfilled. But the Daily's current
suggestion that we should have
waited for approval before asking
for money is both illegal and
impractical.
Wrong Implication
The second big error is to say
that the 1972 fee assessment was
only for going to a higher power
and for converting to stereo. The
implication is that, because we
haven't received a power increase,
half of the money has been
wasted, and the students deceived.
In fact, as the Daily reported at
the time, and has often reported
since, about $18,000 (46 percent)
went to operating expenses for
1972-73. Another $18,000 went
to converting to stereo (we had to
rewire the entire station, buy
stereo equipment, etc.). Only
about $3500, or about seven
percent, went to the costs of
higher power. This information
was presented to the students in
1972, and the Daily had that
information when they endorsed
our 1972 fee referendum.
The Daily asks, "Would
students have voted through
$39,000 simply for the station to
go stereo?" The students knew
then, if they cared, that most of
the money was going for
operating expenses and stereo. We
did not deceive them. Had the

Daily editorialist checked his files
he would realize that we hadn't
deceived the Daily, either.
Money Needed
Furthermore, KZSU was well
aware in 1972 that we might not
receive a power increase. That
question came up at the meeting
in which the Daily decided to
endorse our fee assessment. The
Daily was aware then, but
apparently has now forgotten,
that we had to have the money in
hand before we could ask the FCC
for more power. They were aware
then, but have forgotten now,
that higher power was a relatively
small portion of the fee
assessment package.
KZSU has made mistakes,
certainly. In retrospect, it now
appears that it may have been a
mistake to purchase the $3500 of
equipment for higher power.At the
time, it looked like a good
decision. It turns out that the
FCC had been wrong when they
accepted our application last
March, an event that virtually
always means approval. But we
had no way of knowing that they
had been wrong.
At the time, with the
information that we had, buying
the equipment was a good
decision, one that will save us over
$1000 should we yet get a power
increase.
However, to imply that KZSU
deceived the students in 1972 is
just plain wrong. It implies that
the Daily helped deceive the
students by endorsing us, yet
nowhere in last week's editorial
did the Daily admit its own
previous errors.
Money Not Wasted
Just as it is impossible to
collect only 25 cents from each
student, so it is impossible for us
to return 25 cents to each
student. The money has not been
wasted. The $3500 equipment is
currently unused, but we will sell
it if it ever becomes apparent that
we will never be able to use it.
The only way we can pay back
the students is through an
improvement in our services. If we
have to sell our new equipment,
you may rest assured that the
money will not be squandered.
Next month KZSU will be
asking for a fee assessment for
1974-75, for $20,000, like the
one that students are currently
paying. This money will cover our
basic operating expenses.When the
voters look at our request, I hope
that they will judge it on its
merits, not on the basis of the
misinformation included in last
week's editorial.

The March 7 Daily editorial
about KZSU was based on at least
two factual errors that could have
been avoided had the Daily
editorial writers read their own
files. The editorial discusses
KZSU's 1972-73 fee assessment,
which brought the station about
$39,500.
The most prominent error is to
say that KZSU should not have
asked for student money until we
had the power increase that the
money was to finance. There are
two problems.
First, we had to have the
money in hand before we could
ask for more power. We had to be
able to show the FCC that we had
the money to do what we were
asking for. Second, even had we
been able to wait until we had
approval to ask for the money, we
only needed about $3500. Fee
assessments come in $11,000
increments. The university
