# Union Bargaining Issues

The recent Daily arti- le
concerning the progress of
negotiations between the
University and United Stanford
Employees accurately reflects the
general tone of my remarks; it is
inaccurate with respect to a
number of specifics. Union
representation is a relatively new
development in University life and
concerns procedures and concepts
which are complex and difficult
to understand. For this reason,
and because the inaccuracies
concern issues of considerable
importance, 1 would like to set
forth here what I did say on
Friday.
I should reiterate at the outset
what I stressed on Friday: The
University is obliged by law to
bargain with USE as the exclusive
representative of the 1400
employees within the bargaining
unit. It would be unlawful and
certainly detrimental for the

University to deal directly with
employees in the bargaining unit
rather than with the USE
negotiators.
This limitation on University
communication is important to
understand because it helps to put
in context my remarks about the
issues which ahve been covered at
the bargaining table. Many
important issues, such as wages
and benefits, simply have not yet
been reached in negotiations and
consequently are not appropriate
subjects for public discussion by
the University.
Closed Shop Issue
One issue which I discussed
concerns the union proposal to
restrict people outside the
bargaining unit from regularly
performing work normally
performed by employees within
the bargaining unit. I did not say
that the University agreed with
this principle. I stressed, however,
that such an approach was simply

unworkable within a University
because of a number of very
substantial, yet competing,
interests.
I spoke specifically of two such
interests. One is the very common
and necessary involvement of
faculty and professors outside the
bargaining unit in work similar to
that of technicians in academic
research. In the University's view
there is simply no question that
professors must be able to set up
their own experiments, try out
new techniques and generally
enjoy the freedom they now have
to design their own projects.
A related interest concerns
student employment provided by
the University as a form of
financial aid and involving, in a
number of cases, the performance
of work similar to that performed
by members of the bargaining
unit. Continuation of such
employment opportunities for
students is critical, of course, yet
student employees who work less
than half time were excluded
from the bargaining unit by the
NLRB.
Standards
The second issue which I
discussed concerned the Union's
proposal for a "maintenance of
standards" clause. This is a clause
which provides that wages, hours
and working conditions will not
be reduced below the level
prevailing at the time of execution
of the contract. The Daily article
does not accurately convey my
explanation of the University's
position with respect to such a
clause.
I did not say the University
agreed in principle with such a
clause. I did say the University
had no intention of systematically
worsening working conditions for
employees in the bargaining unit.
I pointed out, however, that a
serious consequence of a
maintenance of standards clause is
that it can prohibit changes which
are terribly important to the
University as a whole but which
have relatively minor impact on
working conditions.
I discussed on Friday one

example which had been discussed
at the bargaining table to illustrate
the problem. The example
concerned a University decision to
build a building on a parking lot,
the result of which might require
some employees to walk a bit
further to work. That might be
considered a worsening of
working conditions. When the
University bargaining team raised
this example at the bargaining
table, USE agreed that that was in
fact the kind of worsening of
working conditions which they
intended to bar by the inclusion
of a "maintenance of standards"
clause.
Bog Down
I stated on Friday, as I have
stated at the bargaining table, that
it is the University's position that
we ought not to get bogged down
in such restrictions which can
seriously affect the vitality of the
institution, a vitality which is
important for the entire
community including members of
the bargaining unit.
In concluding, I wish to stress
the important point which the
Daily article does accurately
record. It certainly isn't true that
the University is trying to drag
out negotiations or has an interest
in doing so. The University is
committed to achieving a fair and
equitable settlement at the
bargaining table as expeditiously
as possible. The University is
committed to this objective not
simply because it is consistent
with University interests, which it
is, but also because it is the only
appropriate attitude for either
party at the bargaining table.
The issues are complex and the
competing interests frequently
quite real. Certainly, the
negotiations, if they are to be
successful in finding ways of
appropriately accommodating and
harmonizing these interests, are
necessarily long and detailed. So
long, however, as both sides
continue to bargain earnestly,
candidly, and in good faith, I am
confident that a satisfactory
resolution can be achieved.
