Ombudsman's Search Committee
seeks nominees until April 11
Harvey Hall, former Stanford registrar and the first person to hold the position of
University ombudsman for more than a calendar year, will retire this June.
Nominations and applications for the 1974-75 ombudsman are now being sought by a
search committee headed by Prof. Alberta Siegel, psychologist in the Department of
Psychiatry.
Other members of the search committee include Sally Mahoney, University
registrar; Beth Garfield, Associated Students Council of Presidents; Lincoln Moses,
graduate dean; and Paul Seaver, associate professor of history.
Their recommendations are expected to be forwarded to President Richard W.
Lyman by the end of next month. The deadline for nominations and applications is
April 11.
While the ombudsman ordinarily investigates grievances on request from in
dividuals, the person in this position may also initiate independent action on per
ceived inconsistencies or unfairness in the life of the University.
The power of the office rests on its reputation for fairness, objectivity, tact, and
respectful concern for the welfare of all members of the University community and
for the well-being of the institution.
The ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries into the issues involved,
and makes recommendations for suitable action. Given access on a confidential basis
to all official University records, the ombudsman's remedial powers include per
suasion and private or public criticism.
The current opening will run from Sept. 15, 1974, to June 15, 1975, on a 60 percent
time basis. Individuals seeking further information should contact Siegel at ext. 5343.
