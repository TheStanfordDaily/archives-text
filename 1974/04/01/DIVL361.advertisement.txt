STUDENTS RESIDENCE
STAFF POSITIONS,
1974-75
The Dean of Student Affairs Office has scheduled three in
formal discussion sessions for students interested in applying
for student residence staff positions for 1974-75. These sessions
will be held in the Tresidder Small Lounge Tuesday, April 2,
through Thursday, April 4, from 7-9:00 p.m.
Interested persons may attend any one of the three meetings,
but in order to keep the meetings as small as possible it is
suggested that those whose last names begin with A-J attend on
Tuesday, K —R on Wednesday, and S—Z on Thursday. A current
Resident Fellow or Director, some student staff members, and a
member of the Dean of Student Affairs staff will be available to
gove a brief presentation about student staff jobs and to answer
questions. We hope these meetings will help students decide
whether or not they wish to apply for a residence staff position.
Applications and written materials will be available at the
meetings. All students, both graduate and undergraduate, are
urged to apply.
Although all students are urged to attend one of the in
formational meetings and to pick up applications there,
beginning April 5 written information and applications will be
available from the reception desk of the Residential Education
Division of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, 3rd floor,
