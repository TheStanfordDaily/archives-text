# Alioto Says Brown Hid Source Of Gift
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
Friday night accused Secretary of
State Edmund G. Brown Jr. of
deliberately concealing the fact that he
received a $21,000 campaign
contribution from an oil company.
Speaking at a press conference
preceeding a fundraising banquet at
Palo Alto's Cabana Hyatt House,
Alioto accused his fellow Democratic
gubernatorial aspirant of "actively
concealing" the source of the
contribution by listing it as "Perta
Marketing Co." instead of by its full
name, Perta Oil Marketing Co.
Brown can no longer "pose as the
vestal virgin in the temple of campaign
reform," Alioto declared.
Alioto said the contribution from
Perta — which markets Indonesian oil
in this country — was covered up
because it came at a time when "one
of the issues is whether we make
ourselves independent of foreign oil."
According to the mayor, 31 percent
of Perta is owned by Brown's father,
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr.
Alioto questioned why Brown Sr.
"became a conduit for Indonesian oil
in California," and jokingly suggested
that perhaps he "is a cousin of
Suharto's."
The oil contribution issue was first
raised in public last week by
Claremont attorney Herb Hafif,
another Democratic contender. But
Alioto indicated Friday that he would
continue to press the issue as well.
"Nobody has heard the end of the
Perta Oil Marketing Co., and the
reasons for the concealment will
become clear," he said.
Alioto also announced that he had
asked Town Hall of Southern
California to arrange a debate between
Brown and himself for April 23 in Los
Angeles under a format selected by the
nonpartisan organization.
He discounted Brown's proposal of
a debate between all 18 Democratic
gubernatorial candidates as "a method
of evasion" and "a travelling road
show. The only question would be
whether we'd hold it in Chavez Ravine
or the Coliseum."
Despite his harsh criticism of
Brown, Alioto said he would support
Brown if the latter received the
Democratic nomination in the June 4
primary because Brown would be a
better governor than either of the two
Republican hopefuls, Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke or state Controller Houston
I. Flournoy.
Although polls still show Reinecke
leading Flournoy, Alioto said he

expects Flournoy to be the eventual
nominee because he has been
"annointed" by "the big Republican
corporate money men" — presumably
including Palo Alto electronics
magnate and former Stanford trustee
David Packard.
Alioto also disagreed with polls in
his own party which show Brown still
the frontrunner. Alioto said a poll
taken for another candidate by former
McGovern pollster Pat Caddell showed
him running virtually even with
Brown.
The mayor said he expects to spend
about $1 million — "too damn much"
— on the primary campaign, and at
least that much again in the general
election if he wins the nomination.
