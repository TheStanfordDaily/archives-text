# The
						Pentagon And Industrialists

The Wall Street Journal reports that
Congress is in the "mood" to pass the record
military budget proposed by President Nixon
with little opposition. This is hardly news,
but rather a consistent trend on military
spending which is virtually unbroken over the
past 20 years. Nevertheless, the Pentagon is
taking no chances. Led by Defense Secretary
James Schlesinger and Pentagon stooge
Joseph Alsop, a massive campaign in favor of
the new budget is underway.
The most obscene remark thus far comes
from Schlesinger, who is a former Director of
the CIA as well as an arms strategist with the
Rand Corporation. This came when
Schlesinger stated we must increase our
armaments in order to have disarmament.
While this remark surely warmed the
hearts of the arms industrialists, it amounted
to the same degenerate double-talk that had
this country waging a war in Indochina for
peace, destroying Vietnamese cities in order
to save them, and conducting a criminal
bombing policy for national honor.
Great Budget Tragedy
The great tragedy with the new $86
billion budget is that it will not only
continue to drain the wealth and spirit of this
country dry, but is basically designed to pay
for massive new genocidal weapon systems.
This includes the Trident submarine missile
system and the B-l Bomber which, together,
would cost over $100 billion before
completion.
The Trident submarines, costing $1.3
billion each, are scheduled to replace
the Polaris/Poseidon submarine system. The
Polaris/Poseidon system, due for completion
next year, has 656 ballistic missiles equipped
with multiple warheads capable of hitting
5120 separate targets with nuclear bombs
several times more powerful than the one
which laid waste Hiroshima.
With the rest of our nuclear forces, which

include 1000 land-based Minuteman missiles
equipped with multiple warheads, 54 large
Titan missiles, and 440 long-range bombers
(B-52), this comprises a vast overkill force
capable of annihilating any number of
countries within a few hours. The Trident,
which simply increases the number of
deliverable warheads per submarine, will not
add to our national security as additional
overkill is meaningless. It will, however, add
to the profit margins of the arms
industrialists and their private investors, as
well as insuring continuing contracts for
Lockheed (the prime contractor for the
Trident missile) and similar companies.
B-l Story Same
It is the same story with the B-l Bomber.
The Pentagon only recently completed a
multi-billion dollar modification of the B-52
bomber. But now they want it replaced with
241 B-l bombers capable of carrying 40 tons
of weapons, and costing over $60 million
each.
Through an annual budget which exceeds
that of a great many countries, the Pentagon
and its industrial arm have achieved a near
total domination over 'our society. The
Pentagon estimated the value of its real and
personal property as $214 billion in 1970. It
is, in fact the largest business in the world,
operating over 2000 military bases
throughout the globe and entering into over
20,000 industrial contracts each year.
In terms of outright sales of armaments,
the military/industrial complex accounted
for $11 billion worth from 1962 through
1968 alone, with projections of $2 billion
annual sales through 1975. It is estimated
that over the'past 25 years, the United States
is responsible for scattering some $50 billion
worth of armaments around the world.
'Merchants Of Death'
A few decades ago the arms manufacturers
were labeled the 'merchants of death'. With

the development of technology they have
evolved to 'architects of genocide'. The
economics of death which has become the
basis of the military/industrial complex must
be stopped; the stranglehold of the military
and its industrial arm over our society ended.
It is now imperative that we direct our
vast wealth and working toil toward solving
our human and environmental problems. This
includes rebuilding our cities, providing
adequate medical care and a decent standard
of living for all Americans, building new
transportation systems, developing new
energy sources, and so many other programs
vital to our future.
Such a drastic change of priorities will not
come easily; it must be pursued at all levels,
from direct appeal to Congress to organized
opposition similar in tactics to the
anti-Vietnam war movement. Corporations
much be exposed for the huge profits they
derive from military contracts, and this
includes the practice of planned weapons
obsolescence to insure that contracts keep
coming in without paust.
Nationalize Armaments
An eventual goal should be the
nationalization of all armament industries.
This would end the odious policy of private
investors making a profit from war and
armament, something which no truly
civilized society could tolerate, and it would
more easily facilitate major reconversion
programs without producing economic chaos.
A major escalation of the arms race is
underway behind the SALT conference and
the smiles of Henry Kissinger. The very
future of this nation, and that of humanity,
is directly related to ending this insanity
before it is forever too late.
