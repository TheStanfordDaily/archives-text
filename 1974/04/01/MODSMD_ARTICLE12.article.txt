# Bergman Case--A 'Trial Balloon?
## 
### 
Robert Bradford

Periodically a case appears in
the lower courts which might be
considered as a "trial balloon" of
the legal industry to see how the
public might react to new
interpretations of our
Constitution. If little notice is
taken, then this becomes
precedent for later decisions
which may profoundly affect the
future of our Republic.
I seriously believe the recent
case of Josephine E. Bergman, the
cancer victim whom Stanford
Hospital denied injections of a
vitamin prescribed by her
physician, was such a "trial
balloon" of importance.
Our Constitution preserves for
the people all rights not
specifically delegated. It is up to
government to show
constitutionally that it may enter
into any phase of your life. This it
does in several ways, such as
constitutional amendments or
simply by trying to establish an
interpretation with sufficient legal
precedent to show that it has
always had this right.
It appears to me that the
Bergman case is a conscious
attempt to establish the "right" of
the bureaucracy to intercede in
the patient-doctor relationship
just as numerous attempts have
been made to intercede in the
client-lawyer relationship by
wiretapping, etc.
Imminent Danger
The groundwork for such an
attempt has been being built for
years and has been seen most
recently in the FDA regulations
which unilaterally decreed the
control of various vitamin and
mineral supplements. From
restricting your personal free

choice in the marketplace it is but
a very short step to restricting the
choice that you and your licensed
physician might make together in
that same marketplace.
Should this succeed, then the
bureaucrats will find themselves in
virtual control over life itself with
the ability to permit or deny any
treatment to any person for any
reason.
Up until now it was clear that
if you and your physician agreed
on a course of action which you
both had reason to believe would
be beneficial, then the court could
not intercede unless it could be
shown that you were mentally
imcompetent, the doctor was
trying to bilk you, or the
treatment was clearly worthless.
In this case there was no question
as to the competence of the
patient or the ethics of the
doctor.
The judge admitted that the
medical profession was divided on
the question of Laetrile but a
telephoned deposition was read
into the court record from Dr.
Kanematsu Sigiura of
Sloan-Kettering Institute, who
said that in two out of three series
of tests he achieved 4/5 regression
in malignant mammary tumors,
with the "no effect" test having
used defectiVv naterial.
Over-l >d Argument
How, then, could the judge
make a decision which was so
contrary to precedent? In his
decision he used the same
argument which has helped
establish and justify tyrants
throughout history, the "Greater
Good."
To quote directly from the
concluding paragraph of his

written decision in the case of
James H. Bergman and Josephine
E. Bergman vs. Stanford
University Medical Center as
rendered this last week:
"Individual rights are of supreme
importance in this country, but
even individual rights must
sometime yield to the greater
good."
Setting aside the most obvious
question of who did he help and
for the "Greater Good"of whom,
Judge John S. Mclnery's decision
would erode the basic foundation
of any free society. The
Constitution set up our court
system to preserve the rights of
the minority, the individual
against the will or whim of the
majority, and this Judge would
use our very court system to
destroy the Constitution itself.
This is the very rationale which
was used to try and justify slavery
in the South, to enslave for the
"Greater Good." This is the very
rationale which the SLA uses
today to violate the rights of
Patricia Hearst for the "Greater
Good." This is the very rationale
used for killing the Jews in
Germany; to purify the race for
the "Greater Good."
Vague Goal
Collateral with this is the
doctrine of "the end justifies the
means" and the judge's willingness
to sacrifice Josephine Bergman to
some undefined "Greater Good"
which might accrue to some
unknown recipients. This doctrine
certainly appears to be an attempt
to justify an otherwise
unjustifiable "means" by a
completely undefined "end."

Early in the history of our
country the founding fathers
recognized that any branch of
government might encroach upon
our liberty and for this reason
made the statement "The price of
liberty is eternal vigilance."
This is the time and place for
each of us to be vigilant, because
today the bell tolls for Josephine
Bergman, but tomorrow for
whom will the bell toll? It may be
too late for Bergman, but God
save us if we cannot recognize this
simple truthâ€”that without
individual rights there is no
"Greater Good."
