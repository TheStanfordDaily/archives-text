# Brazil's Last Decade
## 
### 
Felstiner et 01.

Since the ousting of the last
freely elected president on March
31, 1964, Brazil has been
governed by the iron hand of the
military. The inauguration of the
fourth general-president two
weeks ago indicated that the
future will not be bright for the
democratic forces in the country.
Summary arrests, torture, the
suspension of constitutional
guarantees such as habeas corpus
and the right of free assembly,
censorship of all kinds of mass
communication such as the press,
popular music and TV programs,
the purge of dissenting professors
and students in the universities,
and the denial of the right to
strike will continue.
Ten years ago the temporary
character of the take-over was
stressed by the military and its
allies. President Johnson
welcomed the new regime even
before the ousted president had
left the country. Two weeks ago,
Mrs. Nixon attended the
inauguration of the new
general-president, Ernesto Geisel.
These are only symbols of a
strong continuing support of the
Brazilian junta by the U.S. We are
asked to believe that this support
— like that of other military
juntas in Latin America — is part
of the defense of the "free"
world. If the defense of the free
world leads us to support the
military dictatorships of the Third
World, what kind of freedom are
we talking about?
Economic Propoganda
The main line of propoganda of
the Brazilian government rests
upon an impressive rate of
economic growth in the last five
years. However, the social costs of
that growth have been much less
publicized. An increasing
concentration of income in the
hands of the rich has taken place.
In the ten year period
minimum wages declined 30
percent in real value. Infant
mortality has increased, even in
Sao Paulo, the most developed
city of the country. The
Northeast—the poorest
region—has an average diet far
below the UN established
minimum requirements and this
situation has deteriorated
throughout the times of economic
boom.
Of course, the production of
cars and color TVs has increased
substantially. Admittedly, these
are only examples. But they reveal
the kind of economic growth
which is occuring in Brazil. Is this
the picture that development
based on foreign investment and
support has to offer?
U.S. Corporate Interest
The combination of very low
labor costs, the discipline of the
workers through government
control of the labor unions and
the prohibition of strikes, and the
tax incentives to the corporations
explain substantially the interest
that the U.S. corporations have
maintained in Brazil. Is this the
climate conducive to investments
which American foreign policy
aims to create?
The realities of the oppression
to which the Brazilian people is
subjected are clear. As with Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy,
someday the true nature of the
repressive government in
"modernizing" Brazil will be
known by the American and
Brazilian peoples. But we do not
have to wait until then to
understand the extent of the
disservice that the Brazilian
military junta, with the economic
and military aid of the U.S.
government and the incentive of
the U.S. corporate interests, has
done to its people through the use
of force and terror. We all share
complicity by our silent
acceptance of this situation.
