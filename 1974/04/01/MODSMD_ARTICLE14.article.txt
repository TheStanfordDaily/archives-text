# Medical Center Shuffles Administrators
## 
### 
Three major administrative changes at the
Medical Center become effective today.
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, former director of
Stanford Hospital, is now medical director of the
Medical Center and associate dean for clinical
affairs of the School of Medicine.
Paul B. Hofmann, former deputy director of the
Hospital, takes over as director of the Stanford
Hospital and Clinics.
The new director of development for the
Medical Center is Dudley C. Kenworthy, former
associate general secretary for the University.
The appointments were announced last month
by Dr. Clayton Rich, vice president for medical
affairs and dean of the School of Medicine.
In his new position, Gonda will supervise the
patient care activities of the medical staff with the
Hospital and Clinics. He will work closely with
community and faculty physicians, as well as
residents, interns and postdoctoral fellows.
Gonda, 52, will also coordinate the development
of the Medical Center's quality assurance and
professional standards review programs.
Hofmann, 32, is one of the youngest university
hospital directors in the country and the youngest
ever at the University. In his new job, he will
assume responsibility for the administration of the
Hospital and Clinics.
Kenworthy becomes head of the Medical
Center's fundraising efforts. During the past five
years, the Center has received an average of $9
million a year from private gift sources.
Previously, Kenworthy directed the University's
major gifts program in Northern California and the

Pacific Northwest. Both his present position and his
past one are related to the current $300 million
Campaign for Stanford, begun two years ago.
The appointments of Gonda and Hofmann were
part of an administrative reorganization in the
Medical Center, which will consolidate the
management of all patient-care functions, Rich
said. The Center's financial operations were merged
last September.
'The revised organization largely is a response to
the increasingly interdependence of the Medical
School, Hospital and Clinics," he said. "The aim is
to achieve a high degree of coordination and
effectiveness to meet the changing needs of the
entire Medical Center."

Another appointment was announced last
month by Rich. Dr. I. Robert Lehman, professor of
biochemistry was named chairman of the
Department of Biochemistry at the School of
Medicine, effective Sept. 1.
He will succeed Dr. Paul Berg, head of the
department since 1970, who is relinquishing his
administrative responsibilities to return to teaching
and research.

In another School of Medicine development,
two scientists were named Macy Faculty Scholars
for 1974-1975.
Dr. Eric Shooter, professor of genetics and
biochemistry, and Dr. Irving Weissman, assistant
professor of pathology, have each been awarded a
scholarship from the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation
of New York to support research during their
sabbatical year.

Another appointment was announced last
month by Rich. Dr. I. Robert Lehman, professor of
biochemistry was named chairman of the
Department of Biochemistry at the School of
Medicine, effective Sept. 1.
He will succeed Dr. Paul Berg, head of the
department since 1970, who is relinquishing his
administrative responsibilities to return to teaching
and research.

In another School of Medicine development,
two scientists were named Macy Faculty Scholars
for 1974-1975.
Dr. Eric Shooter, professor of genetics and
biochemistry, and Dr. Irving Weissman, assistant
professor of pathology, have each been awarded a
scholarship from the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation
of New York to support research during their
sabbatical year.
Three major administrative changes at the
Medical Center become effective today.
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, former director of
Stanford Hospital, is now medical director of the
Medical Center and associate dean for clinical
affairs of the School of Medicine.
Paul B. Hofmann, former deputy director of the
Hospital, takes over as director of the Stanford
Hospital and Clinics.
The new director of development for the
Medical Center is Dudley C. Kenworthy, former
associate general secretary for the University.
The appointments were announced last month
by Dr. Clayton Rich, vice president for medical
affairs and dean of the School of Medicine.
In his new position, Gonda will supervise the
patient care activities of the medical staff with the
Hospital and Clinics. He will work closely with
community and faculty physicians, as well as
residents, interns and postdoctoral fellows.
Gonda, 52, will also coordinate the development
of the Medical Center's quality assurance and
professional standards review programs.
Hofmann, 32, is one of the youngest university
hospital directors in the country and the youngest
ever at the University. In his new job, he will
assume responsibility for the administration of the
Hospital and Clinics.
Kenworthy becomes head of the Medical
Center's fundraising efforts. During the past five
years, the Center has received an average of $9
million a year from private gift sources.
Previously, Kenworthy directed the University's
major gifts program in Northern California and the

Pacific Northwest. Both his present position and his
past one are related to the current $300 million
Campaign for Stanford, begun two years ago.
The appointments of Gonda and Hofmann were
part of an administrative reorganization in the
Medical Center, which will consolidate the
management of all patient-care functions, Rich
said. The Center's financial operations were merged
last September.
'The revised organization largely is a response to
the increasingly interdependence of the Medical
School, Hospital and Clinics," he said. "The aim is
to achieve a high degree of coordination and
effectiveness to meet the changing needs of the
entire Medical Center."
