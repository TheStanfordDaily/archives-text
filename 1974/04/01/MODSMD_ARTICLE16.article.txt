# Law Students Aid Seniors With Free Legal Advice
## 
### LAURIE LUCAS 
Mike Gilfix, a recent Stanford
Law graduate, thinks some of
life's exigencies should be free. As
a result of his beliefs, he helped
establish a free senior citizens'
legal services center in the Forest
Ave. Library in downtown Palo
Alto.
'The idea has always been
there," said Gilfix, recalling the
original impetus for the center's
creation. According to Gilfix,
"Values in a Technological
Society," a Stanford law course
which dealt with contemporary
issues including the problems of
old age, restimulated his interest
in the needs of the elderly.
Another law student, Bob
Lane, tried to get the service
started last year, Gilfix added, but
could not find enough interested
attorneys.
Working closely with Diana
Steeples, coordinator of senior
citizen services, Gilfix began in
November with a volunteer,
unpaid corps of 10 law students.
However, the staff has dwindled
to a group of four law students,
who take turns interviewing and
counseling elderly clients between
1 and 5 p.m. each Friday.
Although Gilfix has since
found employment with a Palo
Alto law firm (Danaher, Gunn and
Klynn), he still directs the
program.
Gilfix said the legal aid service
is oriented primarily to older
persons with lower incomes or
limited budgets. However, he

emphasized that no "economic
guidelines" are used to determine
who is eligible.
"We don't toss anyone out,"
he said, indicating that age is the
only criteria for selection: anyone
65 and over is welcome.
"Our concern is preserving
everyone's dignity and
self-respect," Gilfix commented,
stressing that the organization is
intended to provide a service, not
a charity. "Yet many senior
citizens don't come to the legal
aid office," he continued, citing
"lack of mobility" and "intense
pride" as deterrents.
Since the students began
working, about 10 patrons a
month, most of whom are
women, have used the service,
Gilfix estimated. He said some
senior citizens have arrived
carrying a copy of the Nov. 7 Palo
Alto Times, induced by early
coverage of the free legal aid
service. Others received
information from senior citizens'
news literature circulated by
Diana Steeples. "We see ourselves
as an extension of her (Steeple's)
office," Gilfix said.
Assessing the issues
confronting his staff, Gilfix noted
that most of the elderly who
come have "simple problems,"
concerning changes in social
security regulations including
supplemental federal security
income for the aged, blind and
disabled, consumer complaints
and landlord-tenant relationships.

Diana Steeples. "We see ourselves
as an extension of her (Steeple's)
office," Gilfix said.
Assessing the issues
confronting his staff, Gilfix noted
that most of the elderly who
come have "simple problems,"
concerning changes in social
security regulations including
supplemental federal security
income for the aged, blind and
disabled, consumer complaints
and landlord-tenant relationships.
Mike Gilfix, a recent Stanford
Law graduate, thinks some of
life's exigencies should be free. As
a result of his beliefs, he helped
establish a free senior citizens'
legal services center in the Forest
Ave. Library in downtown Palo
Alto.
'The idea has always been
there," said Gilfix, recalling the
original impetus for the center's
creation. According to Gilfix,
"Values in a Technological
Society," a Stanford law course
which dealt with contemporary
issues including the problems of
old age, restimulated his interest
in the needs of the elderly.
Another law student, Bob
Lane, tried to get the service
started last year, Gilfix added, but
could not find enough interested
attorneys.
Working closely with Diana
Steeples, coordinator of senior
citizen services, Gilfix began in
November with a volunteer,
unpaid corps of 10 law students.
However, the staff has dwindled
to a group of four law students,
who take turns interviewing and
counseling elderly clients between
1 and 5 p.m. each Friday.
Although Gilfix has since
found employment with a Palo
Alto law firm (Danaher, Gunn and
Klynn), he still directs the
program.
Gilfix said the legal aid service
is oriented primarily to older
persons with lower incomes or
limited budgets. However, he

emphasized that no "economic
guidelines" are used to determine
who is eligible.
"We don't toss anyone out,"
he said, indicating that age is the
only criteria for selection: anyone
65 and over is welcome.
"Our concern is preserving
everyone's dignity and
self-respect," Gilfix commented,
stressing that the organization is
intended to provide a service, not
a charity. "Yet many senior
citizens don't come to the legal
aid office," he continued, citing
"lack of mobility" and "intense
pride" as deterrents.
Since the students began
working, about 10 patrons a
month, most of whom are
women, have used the service,
Gilfix estimated. He said some
senior citizens have arrived
carrying a copy of the Nov. 7 Palo
Alto Times, induced by early
coverage of the free legal aid
service. Others received
information from senior citizens'
news literature circulated by
Diana Steeples. "We see ourselves
