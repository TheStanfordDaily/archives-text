# Cardinals Reach Riverside Finals, Then Bow To Vengeful Sun Devils
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Spring vacation, a time of rest
and relaxation and a time of
preparation, mentally and
physically, for the upcoming
spring quarter, was very rewarding
for Stanford's baseball team.
The Cardinals, 5-11 going into
the Riverside Intercollegiate
Baseball Tournament, surprisingly
won the Gold Division with a 5-2
record. However, Stanford, which
had beaten Arizona State 12-10
Friday, lost to the Sun Devils 6-3
Saturday night in the
championship game to finish
second in the eight-team field.
Stanford plays host to
Washington State in a
non-conference game at 2:30 p.m.
tomorrow in Sunken Diamond.
Card sophomore catcher Dave
Baker took home the tourney's
Most Valuable Player award with
a .461 batting average for the
week. He belted his first home run
of the year Wednesday in
Stanford's 6-4 win over UCLA.
Baker, the team's leading hitter at
.327 going into the tournament,
collected 12 hits in 26 at bats
through Friday's games, helping
the Cards clinch a berth in the
championship game.
"Every year this tournament
seems to relax us," said Stanford
head coach Ray Young. "It is a
very conducive atmosphere for us
to play well. It's a relief for the
players to get away from school
and finals and just have a week of
baseball to think about."
Stanford 14, Tulane 2
With just baseball to think
about, Stanford opened the
tournament with a 14-2 rout of
Tulane, the seventh-ranked team
in the country, Monday. Then the
Cards blanked Wisconsin 11-0.
Stanford's A 1 Arthur and Dave
Frost each pitched complete
games to gain the victories. For
Arthur the win was most
satisfying since it was his first win
in five decisions.

"This was an important game
for Al," said Young. "It gave him
a big boost mentally. He had been
pitching well but was wondering if
he was ever going to get a win."
The Stanford bat support was
devastating. Mark Lucich ripped
his third home run of the season
— a 400-foot shot over the center

Robinson, Lucich, Bob Hampton,
and Pitchford broke open a
slugfest in the fifth inning as the
Cards went ahead 11-6 and
eventually won 15-9 over Oregon.

transfer from Bakersfield, gained
his first win of the year.
Stanford 12, ASU 10
Hampton's record-tying six
runs batted in from an
inside-the-park three-run homer
and a single, spearheaded the
Cards barrage.
Hampton's feat tied John Lung
of UCLA, Lloyd Guffis of Dlinois
and Dave Kingman of USC.
Freshman John Yandle, who
was knocked out of the box
against Oregon Thursday, came
back with no rest to pick up the
win for Stanford.

Riverside 6, Stanford 3

caught looking past the
tournament hosts. Arthur
dropped his fifth game of the

Cards could not score enough runs
to win.
ASU 6, Stanford 3
A disastrous second inning,
when the Sun Devils tallied five
times proved fatal to the Cards.

SPRAY HITTER — Gary Bei, a sophomore second baseman on the
Stanford baseball team, attempts a bunt against University of San
Francisco early in the season. Bei was 7 for 23 in the first six games of
, the Riverside Intercollegiate Baseball Tournament last week.
Spring vacation, a time of rest
and relaxation and a time of
preparation, mentally and
physically, for the upcoming
spring quarter, was very rewarding
for Stanford's baseball team.
The Cardinals, 5-11 going into
the Riverside Intercollegiate
Baseball Tournament, surprisingly
won the Gold Division with a 5-2
record. However, Stanford, which
had beaten Arizona State 12-10
Friday, lost to the Sun Devils 6-3
Saturday night in the
championship game to finish
second in the eight-team field.
Stanford plays host to
Washington State in a
non-conference game at 2:30 p.m.

Baker, the team's leading hitter at
.327 going into the tournament,
collected 12 hits in 26 at bats
through Friday's games, helping
the Cards clinch a berth in the
championship game.
"Every year this tournament
seems to relax us," said Stanford
head coach Ray Young. "It is a
very conducive atmosphere for us
to play well. It's a relief for the
players to get away from school
and finals and just have a week of
baseball to think about."

SPRAY HITTER — Gary Bei, a sophomore second baseman on the
Stanford baseball team, attempts a bunt against University of San
Francisco early in the season. Bei was 7 for 23 in the first six games of
, the Riverside Intercollegiate Baseball Tournament last week.
Spring vacation, a time of rest
and relaxation and a time of
preparation, mentally and
physically, for the upcoming
spring quarter, was very rewarding
for Stanford's baseball team.
The Cardinals, 5-11 going into
the Riverside Intercollegiate
Baseball Tournament, surprisingly
won the Gold Division with a 5-2
record. However, Stanford, which
had beaten Arizona State 12-10
Friday, lost to the Sun Devils 6-3
Saturday night in the
championship game to finish
second in the eight-team field.
Stanford plays host to
Washington State in a
non-conference game at 2:30 p.m.

Card sophomore catcher Dave
Baker took home the tourney's
Most Valuable Player award with
a .461 batting average for the
week. He belted his first home run
of the year Wednesday in
Stanford's 6-4 win over UCLA.
Baker, the team's leading hitter at
.327 going into the tournament,
collected 12 hits in 26 at bats
through Friday's games, helping
the Cards clinch a berth in the
championship game.
"Every year this tournament
seems to relax us," said Stanford
head coach Ray Young. "It is a
very conducive atmosphere for us
to play well. It's a relief for the
players to get away from school
and finals and just have a week of
baseball to think about."
Stanford 14, Tulane 2
With just baseball to think
about, Stanford opened the
tournament with a 14-2 rout of
Tulane, the seventh-ranked team
in the country, Monday. Then the
Cards blanked Wisconsin 11-0.
Stanford's A 1 Arthur and Dave
Frost each pitched complete
games to gain the victories. For
Arthur the win was most
satisfying since it was his first win
in five decisions.

"This was an important game

a big boost mentally. He had been

devastating. Mark Lucich ripped
his third home run of the season

SPRAY HITTER — Gary Bei, a sophomore second baseman on the
Stanford baseball team, attempts a bunt against University of San
Francisco early in the season. Bei was 7 for 23 in the first six games of
, the Riverside Intercollegiate Baseball Tournament last week.
Spring vacation, a time of rest
and relaxation and a time of
preparation, mentally and
physically, for the upcoming
spring quarter, was very rewarding
for Stanford's baseball team.
The Cardinals, 5-11 going into
the Riverside Intercollegiate
Baseball Tournament, surprisingly
won the Gold Division with a 5-2
record. However, Stanford, which
had beaten Arizona State 12-10
Friday, lost to the Sun Devils 6-3
Saturday night in the
championship game to finish
second in the eight-team field.
Stanford plays host to
Washington State in a
non-conference game at 2:30 p.m.
tomorrow in Sunken Diamond.
Card sophomore catcher Dave
Baker took home the tourney's
Most Valuable Player award with
a .461 batting average for the
week. He belted his first home run
of the year Wednesday in
Stanford's 6-4 win over UCLA.
Baker, the team's leading hitter at
.327 going into the tournament,
collected 12 hits in 26 at bats
through Friday's games, helping
the Cards clinch a berth in the
championship game.
"Every year this tournament
seems to relax us," said Stanford
head coach Ray Young. "It is a
very conducive atmosphere for us
to play well. It's a relief for the
players to get away from school
and finals and just have a week of
baseball to think about."
Stanford 14, Tulane 2
With just baseball to think
about, Stanford opened the
tournament with a 14-2 rout of
Tulane, the seventh-ranked team
in the country, Monday. Then the
Cards blanked Wisconsin 11-0.
Stanford's A 1 Arthur and Dave
Frost each pitched complete
games to gain the victories. For
Arthur the win was most
satisfying since it was his first win
in five decisions.

"This was an important game
for Al," said Young. "It gave him
a big boost mentally. He had been
pitching well but was wondering if
he was ever going to get a win."
The Stanford bat support was
devastating. Mark Lucich ripped
his third home run of the season

SPRAY HITTER — Gary Bei, a sophomore second baseman on the
Stanford baseball team, attempts a bunt against University of San
Francisco early in the season. Bei was 7 for 23 in the first six games of
, the Riverside Intercollegiate Baseball Tournament last week.
Spring vacation, a time of rest
and relaxation and a time of
preparation, mentally and
physically, for the upcoming
spring quarter, was very rewarding
for Stanford's baseball team.
The Cardinals, 5-11 going into
the Riverside Intercollegiate
Baseball Tournament, surprisingly
won the Gold Division with a 5-2
record. However, Stanford, which
had beaten Arizona State 12-10
Friday, lost to the Sun Devils 6-3
Saturday night in the
championship game to finish
second in the eight-team field.
Stanford plays host to
Washington State in a
non-conference game at 2:30 p.m.
tomorrow in Sunken Diamond.
Card sophomore catcher Dave
Baker took home the tourney's
Most Valuable Player award with
a .461 batting average for the
week. He belted his first home run
of the year Wednesday in
Stanford's 6-4 win over UCLA.
Baker, the team's leading hitter at
.327 going into the tournament,
collected 12 hits in 26 at bats
through Friday's games, helping
the Cards clinch a berth in the
championship game.
"Every year this tournament
seems to relax us," said Stanford
head coach Ray Young. "It is a
very conducive atmosphere for us
to play well. It's a relief for the
players to get away from school
and finals and just have a week of
baseball to think about."
Stanford 14, Tulane 2
With just baseball to think
about, Stanford opened the
tournament with a 14-2 rout of
Tulane, the seventh-ranked team
in the country, Monday. Then the
Cards blanked Wisconsin 11-0.
Stanford's A 1 Arthur and Dave
Frost each pitched complete
games to gain the victories. For
Arthur the win was most
satisfying since it was his first win
in five decisions.

"This was an important game
for Al," said Young. "It gave him
a big boost mentally. He had been
pitching well but was wondering if
he was ever going to get a win."
The Stanford bat support was
devastating. Mark Lucich ripped
his third home run of the season
— a 400-foot shot over the center
field fence. And freshman Gary
Pitchford, in his first game for the

his first time to the plate 350-feet

win for the Cards Wednesday
against UCLA. Ken Egusa's two
run single had tied the game for
Stanford 3-3 in the third and

ahead 4-3 in the fifth.
Bernie Hittner, with relief help
from Max Goldstein, evened his
record at 1-1 with the win.
Brigham Young 8, Stanford 6
Mike Williamson was pitching a
fine game, retiring 11 men in a
row, before he was shelled for two
home runs in the sixth inning in
an 8-6 loss to Brigham Young.
Doug Coons and Reed Pew
homered for the Cougars in the
'ixth. Pew added another
round-tripper in the seventh
inning to put the game away for
BYU.
"We had enough chances to
win," said Young. "We couldn't
get a hit when we needed it."
Stanford 15, Oregon 9
Consecutive doubles by Bruce
Robinson, Lucich, Bob Hampton,
and Pitchford broke open a
slugfest in the fifth inning as the
Cards went ahead 11-6 and
eventually won 15-9 over Oregon.
Kent Caldwell, a junior college
transfer from Bakersfield, gained
his first win of the year.
Stanford 12, ASU 10
Hampton's record-tying six
runs batted in from an
inside-the-park three-run homer
and a single, spearheaded the
Cards barrage.
Hampton's feat tied John Lung
of UCLA, Lloyd Guffis of Dlinois
and Dave Kingman of USC.
Freshman John Yandle, who
was knocked out of the box
against Oregon Thursday, came
back with no rest to pick up the
win for Stanford.

Riverside 6, Stanford 3
With the championship game
berth clinched the Cardinals were
caught looking past the
tournament hosts. Arthur
dropped his fifth game of the
year. Despite amassing 13 hits the
Cards could not score enough runs
to win.
ASU 6, Stanford 3
A disastrous second inning,
when the Sun Devils tallied five
times proved fatal to the Cards.
Frost took the brunt of the
shellacking for his third loss of the

year in six decisions.

for the winners.
