# Shoppers' Hunt For Bargains Nets $111,000 For Art Museum
## 
### BONITA B. RODDEN 
Bridles, ice skates, silver
candleholders and a Renaissance chest
priced at $4500 — bargain hunters
found them all at the fourth biennial
Treasure Market held in the women's
gym March 28, 29 and 30.
The bazaar, sponsored by the
Committee for Art at Stanford, is the
major fund raising event for the
University's Museum of Art. The
proceeds go to the museum's
acquisition fund and educational
curators program.
Market '74 was a definite success,
according to Jane Miller, chairman of
the Committee for Art. "It was super.
It was so organized All these people
working their heads off. .she
exclaimed as one of the over 40
volunteers scurried past her
brandishing a red "sold" - tagged
painting. "It was so much fun," she
added.
Articles valued at hundreds of
dollars sold as quickly as five-cent
paperbacks. By Saturday afternoon
everything had been bought or
donated to the museum except for a
small cardboard box filled with goods.
$111,000 Gross
The sale grossed $111,000 this
year, $31,000 more than Market '72.
The committee made $42,000 in sales
during the first four hours of the sale
alone at the opening night party. The
most expensive item sold was a $3000
painting.
Rolls Royces lined Santa Teresa

Street Thursday night as over 1200
people paid $7.50 to attend the gala
affair. The elegantly attired crowd
were the first to choose from the
grand display of donations. Those not
interested in shopping danced to a
mariachi band and sipped sangria in
the gym decorated with early
California flourishes.
Perhaps the most spectacular
decoration at the party was a set of
eight drapes hanging in the west wing
of the gym. Eight members of the
committee spent 50 hours on each of
the drapes, hand-painting black Aztec
designs from stencils onto the 12 by
24 feet pieces of white burlap. The
drapes are being saved for Treasure
Market '76.
Free Admission
On Friday and Saturday admission
was free and hundreds of browsers
strolled in the east wing among the
tables piled high with linens,
handicrafts and china.
Those more interested in art objects
wandered away from the flea market
to the west wing. There, connoisseurs
of the jDrient admired expensive rugs
and art dealers scrutinized an alleged
Renaissance bureau for its
authenticity.
All donations came from "Stanford
people — friends of the University"
according to Lorraine Daly,
vice-chairman of Market '74.
High Prices
Carol Murdock, a browser eyeing a

low Oriental table marked at $1500,
commented, "I think they have some
lovely pieces here. Many of them are
high quality but, unfortunately, the
prices are high quality too. I wish I
had been here the first night."
One of the most exciting aspects or
the Treasure Market was the sealed
bidding Saturday. When certain
valuable items didn't sell, those
interested bid secretly on them, the
item going to the highest bidder.
Awaiting the lottery results,
anxious customers clustered around
the bidding table. A tense woman
hovered behind the auctioneer opening
an envelope for a 1780 grandfather
clock. Her taut mouth converted to a
joyful smile as the solumn auctioneer
turned to her: "The clock is yours."
