# Swimmers Sixth In NCAA's
## Hencken Wins 200 Breast 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If you could stand
commentator Mark Spitz enough
to watch it on TV, you remember
this year's NCAA swimming
championship as the one where
Indiana almost had to try in order
to lose the crown to USC, 339 to
338.
Stanford's luck wasn't much
better than that of the Hoosiers,
as the Cards, with Brian Roux and
John Hencken fighting illness,
could do no better than a distant
sixth. But there was one moment
that may have made it all
worthwhile . ..
Hencken had the flu before the
NCAA's and came down to Long
Beach, site of the meet, a day
later than the rest of the team.
Friday, competing in his specialty,
the 100 yard breaststroke, he
wasn't in good enough condition
to beat England's David Wilkie of
the University of Miami, and
finished second.
It didn't look good for
Hencken in the 200 breaststroke
Saturday, as Wilkie holds the
world record in that event and has
been beating Hencken
consistently in it.
Successful Plan
But swim coach Jim Gaughran
and Hencken came up with a plan.
Wilkie's usual strategy is to hold
back on the first 100 and pass his
foes early in the second half of
the race. To counteract this,
Hencken swam the first 100 even
slower than Wilkie, recording a
58.5.
Then Hencken sprinted, and, in
what Gaughran called "a fantastic
comeback", passed Wilkie to win
the 200 in a time of 2:01.74,
setting a new American record for
the event.
That was the highlight for the
Cardinals. But Hencken was by no
means the only star.
One Reason
Freshman Dave Fairban!
placed third in the 50 freestyle
clocking a 20.54, and fourth in
the 100 free. Because of the latter

race, Fairbank will be able to tell
his friends back on campus that
he was responsible for USC's
stopping Indiana's string of six
consecutive titles.
Fairbank swam the 100 free in
45.762. An Indiana swimmer was
fifth, a blink back at 45.899. Had
Fairbank not held on to fourth,
Indiana would have won the team
title...
Of course, that's only one of

1001 reasons the Hoosiers lost.
The major catastrophe was that
Indiana's 400 medley relay team
was disqualified in the qualifying
round, as two swimmers jumped
early. With a win in that relay,
Indiana would have picked up 32
points.
Could Have Won
Of course, had all been just,
Indiana might not have picked up
all 32 points. Stanford finished
third in that relay, and Gaughran
insists that had either Hencken or
Roux been healthy, the team,
which also included Fairbank and

Rick Gebers, would have picked
up more than the seven-tenths of
one second needed to beat
Tennessee, which won that event.
The Cards also finished fourth
in the 400 free relay, Fairbank,
Martin Pedley, Bruce Goodwin
and Dean Anderson clocking a
3:04.40.
Other good performances were
scored by Steve Strong, who set a
new Stanford record in the 1650
free with a 15:57, and Randy
Whitchurch, who finished an
unlucky 13th (12 men reach the
finals) in both the 100 and 200
backstroke.
Local Star
One local athlete was the
outstanding performer of the
meet and the main reason USC
was able to take advantage of
Indiana's woes. ,
Freshman John Naber, who
ranks with Rich Kelley as the best
athlete to come out of Woodside
High recently, won three events,
the 100 and 200 backstroke and
the 500 free, setting American
records in the backstroke events,
to score the key points for the
Trojans.
As far as Stanford is
concerned, Naber is the one that
got away .. .
Look To Future
But Gaughran still looks
forward to next season. "All our
team's young. We've got a lot to
look forward to."
The NCAA result underscored
the highlights of the 1974 season,
the last-race dual wins over
Washington and UCLA.
Washington finished fourth with
214 points, (Tennessee was third
with 250) and UCLA was fifth
with 190 points. Stanford scored
only 101 points in finishing sixth,
24 points ahead of North
Carolina.
Even with good health, the
Cards still probably didn't have
enough talent to overtake either
of the teams they beat in dual
competition. So those dual wins
stand as testament to what ali-out
effort and strategic coaching can
do for an outmanned team.

NCAA CHAMP—Sophomore John Hencken continued his battle with
Miami's David Wilkie at the NCAA swimming championships at Long
Beach last week. Wilkie beat Hencken in the 100 breaststroke, which
Hencken won last year. Hencken avenged the defeat by topping the
Brittish Olympian in his own speciality, the 200 breast.
