# Hays Leads Card Women To 11th Place Swim Finish
## 
### 
Freshman Vicki Hays, winning
the 50 yard breaststroke and
finishing second in two other
events, led Stanford's women's
swimming team to an 11th place
finish at the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) championships.
Arizona State won the team
title at the meet, held March
14-16 at Penn State University.
Miami finished second,
Washington third, New Mexico
fourth and UCLA fifth among the

91 schools entered.
Hays set an AIAW record in
the 50 breaststroke, winning in a
time of 30.90. She finished
second in the 100 breast, her
1:07.58 losing only to Cathy Carr
of New Mexico, who set an AIAW
of 1:06.36. She also took second
in the 100 individual medley, her
time of 1:01.12 being less than
half a second slower than that of
the winner, Princeton's Cathy
Corcione, who also set the
association record.
In addition to her individual
efforts, Hays, a native of
Fullerton, also swam the second
leg of the 200 and 400 medley
relay teams, which finished fifth
and eighth, respectively. Her
teammates on the 200 team were
junior Mei Ong, senior Sue Trupin
and freshman Nan Leuschel. Ong,
Hays, Trupin and sophomore
Kathi Heinze made up the 400
team.
Heinze tallied the only other
point scored by Stanford,
finishing 12th in the 100 butterfly
in a time of 1:01.41.
While these performances
earned all of the Cardinals' 73

points, several other swimmers
improved their previous season
bests. Ong completed the 100 and
200 backstroke in 30.98 and
1:06.80. Leuschel swam the 50
free in 26.10, while the 400 free
relay team of Hays, Leuschel,
sophomore Jackie Brink and
Heinze recorded a 3:50.7 mark.
As only Trupin graduates,
these performances point to an
even better finish next season.

91 schools entered.
Hays set an AIAW record in
the 50 breaststroke, winning in a
time of 30.90. She finished
second in the 100 breast, her
1:07.58 losing only to Cathy Carr
of New Mexico, who set an AIAW
of 1:06.36. She also took second
in the 100 individual medley, her
time of 1:01.12 being less than
half a second slower than that of
the winner, Princeton's Cathy
Corcione, who also set the
association record.
In addition to her individual
efforts, Hays, a native of
Fullerton, also swam the second
leg of the 200 and 400 medley
relay teams, which finished fifth
and eighth, respectively. Her
teammates on the 200 team were
junior Mei Ong, senior Sue Trupin
and freshman Nan Leuschel. Ong,
Hays, Trupin and sophomore
Kathi Heinze made up the 400
team.
Heinze tallied the only other
point scored by Stanford,
finishing 12th in the 100 butterfly
in a time of 1:01.41.
While these performances
earned all of the Cardinals' 73

points, several other swimmers
improved their previous season
bests. Ong completed the 100 and
200 backstroke in 30.98 and
1:06.80. Leuschel swam the 50
free in 26.10, while the 400 free
relay team of Hays, Leuschel,
sophomore Jackie Brink and
Heinze recorded a 3:50.7 mark.
As only Trupin graduates,
these performances point to an
even better finish next season.
