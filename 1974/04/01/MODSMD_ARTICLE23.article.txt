# Crew Teams Outdistance St. Mary's
## 
### 
Cold, windy weather and
choppy water didn't stop
Stanford's crew teams from
sweeping a meet with St. Mary's,
held at the Oakland Aquatic Park
Saturday.
The Cardinals' two freshman
boats both defeated St. Mary's by
about 2 1/2 lengths as did
Stanford's junior varsity team. In
the varsity event, it wasn't even
close, as Stanford dominated the
race from the beginning to win by
an almost-embarrassing 6-7
lengths over the 2,000 meter
course.
Stanford gets somewhat
tougher competition this coming
Saturday, as the Cards compete
against Oregon St., USC and Santa
Clara for the Con Findlay Cup.
The race will be held at Stanford's
practice grounds, the Port of
Redwood City.
