# Card Golfers Third At Goleta Tourney
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A strange ruling by officials of
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate golf
tournament may have been the
only thing that separated Stanford
from winning that tournament,
held at the Sand Piper Golf
Course in Goleta Thursday and
Friday.
Going into the second round,
Stanford was tied for first place
with San Diego State, two strokes
ahead of USC. Then, because of
the soggy condition of the course,
officials decided to move the tees
up and allow golfers to move the
ball up to one club length from
any position on the course — even
the rough.
USC took better advantage of
the rule than did anyone else, and
when the round was over, the
Trojans had picked up 10 strokes
on Stanford, according to
Cardinal coach Bud Finger.
Normal rules prevailed in the
third round, but by that time it
was all over. The Trojans won
with a score of 892 with U.S.
International second at 900.
Stanford was a shot back at 901,
one shot ahead of fourth place
San Diego State (902).
In all, 17 schools participated,
fewer than expected. Finger
speculated that the energy
shortage might have held down
the field.
Stanford's low scorer,

somewhat surprisingly, was
freshman Brent Murray. Murray
finished sixth at 223, just two
shots behind the medalist, Kevin
Bench of Air Force, who shot
221.
Murray had a chance to win
until the ninth hole, when Bench
hit a 75-foot putt for a birdie and
Murray pulled his second shot to
the left and had to settle for a
bogey.
Still, the freshman from
Portland, Ore., could have lifted
himself into a tie for second had
he sunk a putt that rimmed the
cup on the 18th hole. Jerry Wisz
of UC-Irvine won a four-way
playoff for second, with Craig
Stadler and Mark Pfeil of USC
third and fourth and Mike Barr of
San Diego State fifth. Murray won
a playoff against Rod Meltzer of
U.S. International for sixth place.
"He's our most improved
player," Finger said. "His scores
have just been going down and
down and down since the
beginning of the season and I
hope they haven't stopped going
down yet."
On the whole, Finger was
satisfied with his team's
performance, considering the
conditions, but noted "we have to
work harder around the greens.
We can stay even on our drives
but we need work on our shorter
shots."
Murray shot 75-74-74 for his
223. Aly Trompas was one shot
behind at 224 (77-72-75) to tie
for ninth place. Dave Baskins shot
226 (75-73-78), and Conrad
Nilmeier was the fourth Stanford
scorer with a 228 (81-74-73).
Other Stanford entrants were
Glenn Goethals, who shot 229,
and George Pettinger at 231.

one shot ahead of fourth place
San Diego State (902).
In all, 17 schools participated,
fewer than expected. Finger
speculated that the energy
shortage might have held down
the field.
Stanford's low scorer,

somewhat surprisingly, was
freshman Brent Murray. Murray
finished sixth at 223, just two
shots behind the medalist, Kevin
Bench of Air Force, who shot
221.
Murray had a chance to win
until the ninth hole, when Bench
hit a 75-foot putt for a birdie and
Murray pulled his second shot to
the left and had to settle for a
bogey.
Still, the freshman from
Portland, Ore., could have lifted
himself into a tie for second had
he sunk a putt that rimmed the
cup on the 18th hole. Jerry Wisz
of UC-Irvine won a four-way
playoff for second, with Craig
Stadler and Mark Pfeil of USC
third and fourth and Mike Barr of
San Diego State fifth. Murray won
a playoff against Rod Meltzer of
U.S. International for sixth place.
"He's our most improved
player," Finger said. "His scores
have just been going down and
down and down since the
beginning of the season and I
hope they haven't stopped going
down yet."
On the whole, Finger was
satisfied with his team's
performance, considering the
conditions, but noted "we have to
work harder around the greens.
We can stay even on our drives
but we need work on our shorter
shots."
Murray shot 75-74-74 for his
223. Aly Trompas was one shot
behind at 224 (77-72-75) to tie
for ninth place. Dave Baskins shot
226 (75-73-78), and Conrad
Nilmeier was the fourth Stanford
scorer with a 228 (81-74-73).
Other Stanford entrants were
Glenn Goethals, who shot 229,
and George Pettinger at 231.
A strange ruling by officials of
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate golf
tournament may have been the
only thing that separated Stanford
from winning that tournament,
held at the Sand Piper Golf
Course in Goleta Thursday and
Friday.
Going into the second round,
Stanford was tied for first place
with San Diego State, two strokes
ahead of USC. Then, because of
the soggy condition of the course,
officials decided to move the tees
up and allow golfers to move the
ball up to one club length from
any position on the course — even
the rough.
USC took better advantage of
the rule than did anyone else, and
when the round was over, the
Trojans had picked up 10 strokes
on Stanford, according to
Cardinal coach Bud Finger.
Normal rules prevailed in the
third round, but by that time it
was all over. The Trojans won
with a score of 892 with U.S.
International second at 900.
Stanford was a shot back at 901,
one shot ahead of fourth place
San Diego State (902).
