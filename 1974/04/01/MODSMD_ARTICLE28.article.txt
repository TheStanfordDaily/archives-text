# Ruggers Fifth At Monterey
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
MONTEREY - Oh spring
vacation! What better way to
spend the first few days off from
the grind of the Farm, then on a
polo field on Monterey Peninsula
sipping beer, watching the
beautiful girls and playing rugby.
Rugby? Well 3500 people and 32
teams including the Stanford
ruggers made the trek to Colins
Polo Field in Pebble Beach for the
16th Annual Monterey National
Rugby Tournament, March 23-24.
There was everything from
streakers to rugger huggers in
Pebble Beach. What the hell is a
rugger hugger? Well, rugby seems
to be the only sport in which the
groupies wear shirts identifying
themselves. The Cards had a
dozen or so huggers in Pebble
Beach to cheer them on to a fifth
place finish.
Stanford won four and lost one
to place fifth. New South Wales
won the tournament. The Cards
played a total of 204 minutes of
rugby in 28 hours. While the fifth
place finish will not hold a place
of honor in the Stanford rugby
hall of fame (the Cards have won
the tourney eight times), Stanford

coach Pete Kmetovic was pleased
with the Cards.
"I'm happy to finish fifth. We
were seeded in the top bracket, so
if we wanted to finish higher we
would have had to beat last year's
champion, the Santa Monica
Rugby Club. Finishing fifth will
probably give us a better seeding
next year," Kmetovic said.
The Cards beat the University
of Montana Rugby Club in the
first round, 6-0. The win gave the
Cards the opportunity to advance
to the next round to meet the
previously unbeaten Cal
State-Long Beach ruggers. The
49ers gave the Cards a scare as
they took a 6-0 halftime lead, but
Stanford shut them out the rest of
the game. Eric Test scored a 30
yard try and Larry Lieberman
converted to tie the score at 6-all
midway through the second half.
John Snieder gave the Cards the
win when he scored a 15 yard
unconverted try with three
minutes remaining.
Stanford met Santa Monica in
the featured game of the third
round, losing to the defending
champs 10-0. 'This was the key

game," said Kmetovic.
The Cards met Peninsula rivals
San Jose State in a grudge match
in the final game of the first day.
The Spartans were unable to gain
revenge over the Cards for the
12-6 last minute win that
Stanford handed the Spartans in
San Jose last February as the
Cardsbeat SJS 6-0.
Stanford now had a chance to
avenge a grudge of its own as the
ruggers met USC on Sunday. The
Trojans had managed to tie the
Cards 10-10 four weeks ago, but
this time Stanford wanted no part
of a tie. "They wanted to prove
that they were the better team."
The Cards did just that, limiting
the Trojans to just a penalty kick
as they beat USC 12-3.

GOODBYE OLD SCRUM — Stanford finished this year's rugby season with a fifth place finish at the
Monterey National Tournament March 24-25. Hie Card ruggers finished the year 9-4-1, won the "Big
Scrum Axe" from Cal and, in their final match, avenged a tie with archrival USC. In addition, the season
brought a tremendous increase in the popularity of the sport at Stanford, a trend expected to continue as
more and more "rugger huggers" and other fans learn the joys of violent, but friendly, sport.
