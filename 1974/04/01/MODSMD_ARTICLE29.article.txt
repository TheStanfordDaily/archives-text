# Occidental Outlasts Stanford Trackmen
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Plagued by injuries, lack of
depth and illness, Stanford's track
team dropped a close contest in
its final non-league dual meet
Saturday, losing to underdog
Occidental 80-65 in Los Angeles.
The Cardinals' spotty
performance was foreshadowed a
week before when Stanford
finished a weak fifth in the Easter
Relays held in Santa Barbara.
Stanford's 1-2 dual meet record
will probably endure more
tarnishing since the Cards are
scheduled to meet a strong Cal
team and nationally ranked USC
and UCLA squads in the next four
weeks.
Following the loss to
Occidental last weekend, coach
Payton Jordan showed the same
stoic resolve that he has displayed
all season. "Over Spring Break we
wanted to maximize the personal
performances and get in as much
work as possible. We wanted to
maintain continuity in our
training, but coming off of finals
week and with the injuries, we
couldn't get that."
Quartermilers Scott Wingo and
John Kessel were afflicted by flu
and tonsilitis, while reliable discus
man Jim Royer lost 17 pounds in
Cowell Center battling
pneumonia. "All I can say is that
we were victimized a little by
injuries, but that given the healthy
men we had, they [Occidental]
took it to us. Our performance
was less than scintillating, and
Occidental earned our respect
with their desire to win. However,
with our total team healthy, we
could have beat them," Jordan
said.
Stanford was also hurt by the
freak sprained ankle Matt Hogsett
incurred while jogging in Long

Beach. Hogsett, who has run
excellently of late, was confined
to running a leg on the 440 relay
while Occidental won the events
he usually competes in, the
intermediate hurdles and the mile
relay. While the difference in
points may not have given the
Cards victory, Hogsett's presence
would have made the meet much
closer.
Tony Sandoval continued his
winning ways with victories in the
mile (4:09.3) and two-mile
(9:02.2). "Sandy was the
outstanding competitor in the
meet," said Jordan. "This will be
the last time we run him in two
races on the same day."
Dave Bagshaw won the high
hurdles and placed second behind
Oxy's Doug Odell in the
intermediates, while steady Steve
Hopkins won the javelin at 223-9.
Tom Banducpi established a
personal best in the shot in
winning at 49-2V& and Mike Hall
took first and second in the triple
and long-jumps, respectively.
But in the end, Occidental
took 11 of the 17 first places, and
as Jordan put it, Stanford "just
didn't have enough men to catch
up."
In the Easter relays Southern
Cal's strength in the sprints and
jumping events gave the Trojans
an easy team title. The Stanford
quartet of Ken Kring, Hogsett,
Kessel and Wingo clocked a
speedy 3:13.9 mile relay that was
good for second behind the
Trojan's 3:11.1. "I think we could
get into the 3:lo's if we all get
hot on the same day," said
freshman speedster Wingo.
The Cards also took third in
the 880 relay and in the distance
medley.

said.
Stanford was also hurt by the
freak sprained ankle Matt Hogsett
incurred while jogging in Long

Beach. Hogsett, who has run
excellently of late, was confined
to running a leg on the 440 relay
while Occidental won the events
he usually competes in, the
intermediate hurdles and the mile
relay. While the difference in
points may not have given the
Cards victory, Hogsett's presence
would have made the meet much
closer.
Tony Sandoval continued his
winning ways with victories in the
mile (4:09.3) and two-mile
(9:02.2). "Sandy was the
outstanding competitor in the
meet," said Jordan. "This will be
the last time we run him in two
races on the same day."
Dave Bagshaw won the high
hurdles and placed second behind
Oxy's Doug Odell in the
intermediates, while steady Steve
Hopkins won the javelin at 223-9.
Tom Banducpi established a
personal best in the shot in
winning at 49-2V& and Mike Hall
took first and second in the triple
and long-jumps, respectively.
But in the end, Occidental
took 11 of the 17 first places, and
as Jordan put it, Stanford "just
didn't have enough men to catch
up."
In the Easter relays Southern
Cal's strength in the sprints and
jumping events gave the Trojans
an easy team title. The Stanford
quartet of Ken Kring, Hogsett,
Kessel and Wingo clocked a
speedy 3:13.9 mile relay that was
good for second behind the
Trojan's 3:11.1. "I think we could
get into the 3:lo's if we all get
hot on the same day," said
freshman speedster Wingo.
The Cards also took third in
the 880 relay and in the distance
medley.
Plagued by injuries, lack of
depth and illness, Stanford's track
team dropped a close contest in
its final non-league dual meet
Saturday, losing to underdog
Occidental 80-65 in Los Angeles.
The Cardinals' spotty
performance was foreshadowed a
week before when Stanford
finished a weak fifth in the Easter
Relays held in Santa Barbara.
Stanford's 1-2 dual meet record
will probably endure more
tarnishing since the Cards are
scheduled to meet a strong Cal
team and nationally ranked USC
and UCLA squads in the next four
weeks.
Following the loss to
Occidental last weekend, coach
Payton Jordan showed the same
stoic resolve that he has displayed
all season. "Over Spring Break we
wanted to maximize the personal
performances and get in as much
work as possible. We wanted to
maintain continuity in our
training, but coming off of finals
week and with the injuries, we
couldn't get that."
Quartermilers Scott Wingo and
John Kessel were afflicted by flu
and tonsilitis, while reliable discus
man Jim Royer lost 17 pounds in
Cowell Center battling
pneumonia. "All I can say is that
we were victimized a little by
injuries, but that given the healthy
men we had, they [Occidental]
took it to us. Our performance
was less than scintillating, and
Occidental earned our respect
with their desire to win. However,
with our total team healthy, we
could have beat them," Jordan
said.
