# Nader Localizes Crusade

(Editor's note: Ralph Nader was in
the Bay Area for speaking
engagements last Thursday. He granted
the Daily an interview during a car trip
between San Francisco and Fremont.)
By BRUCE KADDEN
Ralph Nader, the nation's leading
consumer advocate, slammed the car's
front door and quickly extended his
elbow toward the lock which had
already been pushed down by an alert
reporter.
Nader's next reaction was to reach
for the seat belt, and secure it around
his waist. These actions were not a bit
surprising to anyone who had read his
book Unsafe at Any Speed in which he
attacks the American automobile
industry for designed dangers and for
its unwillingless to adopt crucial safety
devices.
Nader does not own a car. He said
that his ownership of an automobile
would be misconstrued by many
people as an endorsement, " and no
car deserves that."
Auto Industry Criticism
Two areas of the auto industry that
Nader criticized were exhaust
emissions and poorly constructed
bumpers. "Pollution damage costs
billions of dollars worth of product
damage" which creates the need for
more products, he said.
"Bumper damage generates more
business," especially a demand for
spare parts supplied by the same
people who sell the cars, he charged.
"The gross national product is
increasing in proportion to the amount
of waste and misery in society," Nader
asserted.
By his theory of accountability, he
finds General Motors, which he calls
"generous motors," Ford and Chrysler
"primarily responsible for pollution
that comes out of our automobiles."
Energy Crisis
"The energy shortage never existed,
in terms of availability of oil," Nader
claimed. He described the Arab
embargo as a psychological cover, and
claimed that oil companies imported
less than available supplies.
Nader pointed out that the

government was using the energy
situation to promote the construction
of nuclear power plants, reinstate
off-shore drilling and to relax
pollution control standards for
automobiles.
Nader could not resist commenting
on the Watergate Scandal: "Never has
a nation been so tolerant of such
criminal behavior.
"If you're going to be a fugitive
from justice, there's no better place
than the White House," Nader said He
believes the prospects for a
Presidential impeachment or
resignation are good, and that if Nixon
is not out of office by the November
election, the people could elect a
veto-proof Congress.
People's Responsibility
Nader not only attacked the
institutions of society, but also the
people who pay little attention to
these institutions. People work about
three months of every year to pay
state, local and federal taxes, but only
spend about one day per year making
sure it is spent right, he said.
Nader offers a solution to this
inequity in his recent book, Action for
a Change, a student manual for public
interest organizing. The book outlines
the forming of Public Interest
Research Groups (PIRGs) on college
campuses.
Because it is student—directed,
PIRG concentrates on the social
problems which interest students such
as consumer protection, and advocacy,
environmental protection,
landlord-tenant problems, and tax
reform.
"PIRG [for the first time] brings
annually renewable funding base" for
a consumer action program, Nader
said. On most campuses, with such
groups students assess themselves $3 a
year. This money is pooled and used
to hire professional staff who oversee
the work and provide continuity
during vacation periods.
Campus PIRG
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady and
junior Jack Handy are currently
setting up a Stanford chapter, which

will be a part of Nor-Cal PIRG.
Nader is quite optimistic about the
future of PIRG. In three years of
operation, the groups have acquired a
half million student members and have
become firmly established in 18 states.
Nader said that in five years PIRG
could be the "most powerful research
and policy group in the country." He
forsees as many as 500 staff positions
if the funding is available.
Nader pointed out that the failure
to get PIRGs initiated at various
campuses has "never been a failure of
students". Rather, it has been the
regents of the Board of Trustees that
have opposed the organization, he
claimed.

state, local and federal taxes, but only
spend about one day per year making
sure it is spent right, he said.
Nader offers a solution to this
inequity in his recent book, Action for
a Change, a student manual for public
interest organizing. The book outlines
the forming of Public Interest
Research Groups (PIRGs) on college
campuses.
Because it is student—directed,
PIRG concentrates on the social
problems which interest students such
as consumer protection, and advocacy,
environmental protection,
landlord-tenant problems, and tax
reform.
"PIRG [for the first time] brings
annually renewable funding base" for
a consumer action program, Nader
said. On most campuses, with such
groups students assess themselves $3 a
year. This money is pooled and used
to hire professional staff who oversee
the work and provide continuity
during vacation periods.
Campus PIRG
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady and
junior Jack Handy are currently
setting up a Stanford chapter, which

will be a part of Nor-Cal PIRG.
Nader is quite optimistic about the
future of PIRG. In three years of
operation, the groups have acquired a
half million student members and have
become firmly established in 18 states.
Nader said that in five years PIRG
could be the "most powerful research
and policy group in the country." He
forsees as many as 500 staff positions
if the funding is available.
Nader pointed out that the failure
to get PIRGs initiated at various
campuses has "never been a failure of
students". Rather, it has been the
regents of the Board of Trustees that
have opposed the organization, he
claimed.

By BRUCE KADDEN
Ralph Nader, the nation's leading
consumer advocate, slammed the car's
front door and quickly extended his
elbow toward the lock which had
already been pushed down by an alert
reporter.
Nader's next reaction was to reach
for the seat belt, and secure it around
his waist. These actions were not a bit
surprising to anyone who had read his
book Unsafe at Any Speed in which he
attacks the American automobile
industry for designed dangers and for
its unwillingless to adopt crucial safety
devices.
Nader does not own a car. He said
that his ownership of an automobile
would be misconstrued by many
people as an endorsement, " and no
car deserves that."
Auto Industry Criticism
Two areas of the auto industry that
Nader criticized were exhaust
emissions and poorly constructed
bumpers. "Pollution damage costs
billions of dollars worth of product
damage" which creates the need for
more products, he said.
"Bumper damage generates more
business," especially a demand for
spare parts supplied by the same
people who sell the cars, he charged.
"The gross national product is
increasing in proportion to the amount
of waste and misery in society," Nader
asserted.
By his theory of accountability, he
finds General Motors, which he calls
"generous motors," Ford and Chrysler
"primarily responsible for pollution
that comes out of our automobiles."
Energy Crisis
"The energy shortage never existed,
in terms of availability of oil," Nader
claimed. He described the Arab
embargo as a psychological cover, and
claimed that oil companies imported
less than available supplies.
Nader pointed out that the

government was using the energy
situation to promote the construction
of nuclear power plants, reinstate
off-shore drilling and to relax
pollution control standards for
automobiles.
Nader could not resist commenting
on the Watergate Scandal: "Never has
a nation been so tolerant of such
criminal behavior.
"If you're going to be a fugitive
from justice, there's no better place
than the White House," Nader said He
believes the prospects for a
Presidential impeachment or
resignation are good, and that if Nixon
is not out of office by the November
election, the people could elect a
veto-proof Congress.
People's Responsibility
Nader not only attacked the
institutions of society, but also the
people who pay little attention to
these institutions. People work about
three months of every year to pay
state, local and federal taxes, but only
spend about one day per year making
sure it is spent right, he said.

inequity in his recent book, Action for
