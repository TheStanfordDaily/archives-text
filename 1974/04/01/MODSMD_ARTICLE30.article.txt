# Faculty Athletic Representative
## Harbaugh Confronts Maze Of Rules 
### CHRISTA BATTELLE 
The uninformed will swear it's
22-man pandemonium. The
Stanford football fan, basking in
the Saturday afternoon sunshine,
will explain that the last play was
a triple option pass right and
reach for another beer. Geology
Prof. John W. Harbaugh is in the
second category.
But as Stanford's faculty
representative to the Pacific Eight
athletic conference, he views this
football game a little differently
than most fans. Harbaugh sees it
as the end product of a complex
joining of Pac-8 regulations and
NCAA rules.
Since 1969, when he was
appointed by President Kenneth

Pitzer, Harbaugh has shared with
the athletic director the one vote
allotted Stanford at Pac-8
meetings.
Admittedly a "not very good"
two-miler on the University of
Kansas' track team in the 1940'5,
Harbaugh and other faculty
representatives now face problems
much more complex than those of
the 1880's, when faculty control
of athletics began. At that time,
students complained of the
excessive brutality of student-run
football programs that relied on
the "friendly" flying wedge.
Extensive View
His spacious office high in the
Mitchell Building affords an
extensive view of the University.

It's analogous to the view of the
future Pac-8 and NCAA must
have.
Individual schools are realizing
that they must deal with such
major issues as athletic funding
problems, alienation of sports
from the education process and
excesses in recruiting practices.
Equality for women in college
athletics, graduate student
participation and connections
between collegiate and
professional sports are other
major issues that the NCAA must
deal with.
After pulling out thick manuals
of NCAA and Pac-8 regulations,
Harbaugh explained his job.
Besides attending Pac-8 and
NCAA conferences, Harbaugh's
duties include "enforcing and
interpreting these [NCAA and
Pac-8] rules as they pertain to
quotas and aids and certifying
eligibility to compete in
intercollegiate sports."
New Rules
His job will be made even more
complicated by new rulings
adopted by the NCAA at its 1974
convention, especially those
pertaining to "changes in
maximum quota awards."

The quota of awards for
football is 105, for basketball, 18.
Until the new ruling, athletes who
received regular academic
scholarships were not counted as
athletes receiving athletic financial
aid.
Now, such student-athletes as
the son of a faculty member (who
thus receives free tuition) will be
counted as part of the total quota.
In fact, any athlete who has been
recruited may count as part of the
quota.
"Bookkeeping will be
troublesome," Harbaugh said.
"We'll be sorry in some ways that
we instituted these quota rulings."
Harbaugh pointed out that this
rule will restrict the number of
athletes who can participate in
certain sports. The student who is
receiving athletically-related aid
will have an advantage over other
students on scholarships, as only a
limited number of athletes are
allowed under the quotas.
Another problem, according to
Harbaugh, is that coaches will
have to avoid contact with
potential Stanford athletes of less
than "blue-chip quality", so that
no claims of "recruitment" can be
made later.

Harbaugh defined recruitment
as "overtures made by any
member of the athletic staff or
interest," the latter term including
alumni. Telephone contacts count
as recruiting attempts. If a coach
initiates correspondence with a
prospective athlete, it counts as
recruiting.
However, if the athlete writes
first, no claim of recruitment can
be made, as long as a coach does
not later attempt to get him to
come to Stanford for athletic
purposes, according to Harbaugh.
Other changes in NCAA
regulations affect the athletic
professional. He or she is now
allowed to compete as a collegiate
amateur in another sport.
However, the athlete's name
cannot be used commercially and
he or she can receive financial aid
only if not under contract to a
professional sports organization,
Harbaugh said.
Recruiting Problems
Recruiting excesses are
becoming more and more of a
problem at some "football
schools". As college sports such as
football attract big TV contracts
and produce athletes who ask for
