Nixon Faces Major Expenses
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has a final
mortgage payment of nearly $250,000 coming due
this summer for his San Clemente, Calif, estate, and
may be facing other major personal expenses as a
result of possible income tax and impeachment
proceedings.
Although he was nearly a millionaire on paper as
of last May 31, a rapid series of six-figure debts
could deplete Nixon's savings and perhaps lead him
to take out new loans.
A final payment of $226,660, plus $17,000
interest, is due July 15 to the family from whom he
purchased the oceanside San Clemente property five
years ago.
The bulk of Nixon's $988,522 in net worth as of
May 31 was in real estate.
The two major obligations other than the
mortgage payments are only possibilities at this
point.
The White House won't speculate on Nixon's
finances, although the President himself recently
mentioned the possibility of taking a loan.
A joint congressional committee has been
reviewing Nixon's 1969-72 tax returns at the
President's request. It is expected to say shortly
whether it believes Nixon should pay back taxes
which, if all his controversial deductions are
disallowed, could amount to more than $300,000.
Nixon has said he will abide by the committee
findings.
Major points at issue are his deductions for
donations of pre-presidential papers to the
government, his business use of his San Clemente,
Calif, estate, and the tax handling of the sale of two
pieces of real estate.
The other possible major expense could be legal
fees in connection with the Watergate affair.
Atty. Gen. William Saxbe suggested recently that
at some point in any impeachment procedure,
Nixon might have to start paying for his own legal
defense.
As of Jan. 9, the government had spent $290,418
for the President's legal defense.
Mercury Moon Possibly Found
PASADENA, Calif. — Mariner 10's television
cameras swept the heavens near Mercury on Sunday
in search of a mysterious moving object which
scientists said may be a tiny moon.
If confirmed, it would scrap the long-held theory
that Mercury has no satellites.
The first hint of the phantom object came from
the space probe's ultraviolet spectrometers, which
detect radiation invisible to ordinary telescopes or
cameras.
Mariner project officials ordered the moon search
to proceed despite a short circuit that was draining
power from the 1000-pound space explorer.
Scientists have long thought it would be difficult
for a satellite to survive around Mercury because it
would be wrestled about in "a tug-of-war between
the sun and Mercury, eventually falling and crashing
into Mercury."
A preliminary report on what the space probe
has found, included:
— Mercury's surface, pocked by the impact of
meteorites, is strikingly similar to the moon. But its
interior, which probably contains large amounts of

iron, is more like the earth's core.
— The planet is surrounded by a definite
magnetic field, but where the magnetism originates
is still a mystery.
— The surface is evidently a light, porous
material much like the surface of the moon.
Veteran Affairs Probe Ordered
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — President Nixon said
yesterday he has ordered a crack management team
to investigate snarls in the delivery of benefit checks
and services to veterans.
"We owe it to our veterans to be absolutely sure
that we're doing the best job possible for them,"
Nixon said in a national radio address one year and
two days after the last American soldier left
Vietnam.
In recent months, complaints have been
widespread about delayed or misdirected monthly
checks for Vietnam veterans now attending college
under the GI bill. There also has been criticism of
other services for veterans.
Nixon said after these complaints were raised at a
White House news conference, he asked the
Veterans Administration for answers.
The VA took steps to improve its operations, the
President said, but "to make still further
improvements" he has directed VA Administrator
Donald Johnson and Director Roy Ash of the Office
of Management and Budget "to set up a crack
management team which will take a hard look at the
services provided by the VA."
Kissinger Honeymoons
ACAPULCO, Mexico — U.S. Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger honeymooned yesterday with
his bride, the former Nancy Maginnes, in a
magnificent villa perched on a cliff overlooking
Acapulco Bay and the Pacific.
The couple arrived in the international resort on
Saturday by private jet after a small wedding in
Arlington, Va. Kissinger is 50, his bride 39.
The secretary of state and his bride were
expected to be in Acapulco about 10 days. Officials
said two special telephones had been installed in the
villa so Kissinger could remain in close touch with
Washington. He had conferred with Israeli Defense
Minister Moshe Dayan only hours before the
wedding.
Although rumored for months, the timing of the
marriage was a closely guarded secret until the
couple was en route to Acapulco.
Solzhenitsyn Plans No U.S. Visit
ZURICH, Switzerland — Banished Russian
author Alexander Solzhenitsyn said yesterday he
has no plans at the moment to visit the United
States and is concerned that Americans do not
understand his vision for Russia's future.
But in his first interview since his family joined
him in exile here two days ago, Solzhenitsyn told
The Associated Press that "contact between the
peoples of our two huge countries is absolutely
essential."
Seated in the living room of his rented,
seven-room house, Solzhenitsyn said he and his
wife, Natalya, had not completed their inspection of
his vital archives she brought with her from
Moscow.

The Nobel laureate, exiled from Russia on Feb.
13, indicated his principal aim in granting the
interview was to correct "primitive and even
mistaken interpretations" in America of his recent
"Letter to the Soviet Leaders."
In his 15,000-word essay sent to the Kremlin last
fall, Solzhenitsyn exorted the leaders to give up the
Soviet Union's world role, disband the Soviet Union
and concentrate instead on internal development in
Russia proper.
Solzhenitsyn claimed U.S. commentators
described his views as "nationalism," "utopianism,"
and "a call to return to the past."
He said "in this way the press is capable of
introducing incomprehension between distant parts
of the planet rather than mutual understanding."
Impeachment Plans Underway
WASHINGTON — Quiet preparations are under
way in several Senate offices for the possible
impeachment trial of President Nixon later this
year, informed sources say.
With any House action probably more than two
months away, no one will admit it publicly.
Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield has said
several times he has not started any study of how
the Senate would proceed, since rules are set forth
in the Senate Manual and he doesn't want to
anticipate House action.
However, some work is understood to be in
progress in at least two Senate offices, with other
studies being made by individual senators.
Until recently, few senators have been willing to
say they expect the House to return articles of
impeachment against the President.
Last week, however, Mansfield said he has been
told by House members "the votes are there" for
impeachment.
Some estimates are that the issue may reach the
full House in early June. If the House musters the
majority needed for impeachment, that could bring
it to the Senate by early July.
Mansfield says he would expect the Senate trial
to begin within one or two weeks after that.
Dolphins Lose Stars To WFL
TORONTO — Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and Paul
Warfield of the Super Bowl champion Miami
Dolphins grabbed at the chance for financial
security yesterday by jumping from the National
Football League to the World Football League's
Toronto Northmen.
The move is effective at the start of the 1975
season — after the three play out the 1974 option
on their NFL contracts — for a $3 million-plus,
three-year package.
"I think the general consensus of opinion in the
American public was that the World Football
League wasn't a serious contender. We, however,
felt differently and, after coming up here and
listening to what they had to say, decided that the
financial benefits are considerable," Csonka said.
Today's Weather
Rain likely today. Partly cloudy tonight then fair
and warmer Tuesday. Low mid 40s to low 50s. High
today upper 50s to mid 60s and Tuesday in 60s.
Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph shifting to northwest
tonight. Chance of rain 60 percent today.
