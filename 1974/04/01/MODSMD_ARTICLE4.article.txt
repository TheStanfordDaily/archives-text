# Judge Modifies Ruling Restricting Prof In Suit
## 
### DON COX 
Following oral arguments on March
15 and 21, U.S. District Court Judge
Robert Schnacke redefined a court
order on Law Prof. William Gould
restricting communication concerning
the $50 million class action he has
brought against trucking firms and the
Teamsters.
The new order eases previous
restrictions and opens some new
avenues of communication, but is still
unconstitutional Gould said.
The order was imposed following
complaints by the defendants'
attorneys that Gould was engaged in
the unethical solicitation of clients.
Gould has maintained that he was
only trying to collect necessary
evidence for the trial of the firms and
the unions. Gould's suit, brought on
behalf of eight minority truck drivers,
charges the defendants have engaged in
discriminatory hiring practices.
New Order
Under the new order, Gould must
tell the court who in a "specific class"
he is communicating with or he must
sav in what context he contacted

members of the class.
"Presumably [the class] refers to
applicants and employees of the
trucking companies," Gould said.
Gould said they had "no present
plans" to appeal the order, but that
they would if "it becomes necessary."
Will Obey Order
Gould said that the order was
"confusing" but that he would obey
it.
"We have been communicating in
accordance with the order and wfll do
so in the future," he said.
"We will never take any avenue,
however, in which we would turn over
the names of those we are contacting,"
in efforts to obtain evidence of
discriminatory practioes, Gould said.
To do so would expose witnesses to
"retaliation" by the firms or unions
besides being unconstitutional, he said.
Gould's Charges
Gould charged that the defendants'
attorneys were trying to "slow down"
and "destroy the proceedings" but
that their strategy would "misfire and
only increase the liability of their
clients."
Gould said he was "moving ahead"
in his efforts to obtain evidence but
that "very few parties are providing
much in the way of responses"
because of the court order.
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam has
been arguing against the order
restricting communication on Gould's
behalf.
A hearing is scheduled April 12 to
present further arguments against the
order.
Settlement Blasted
Gould also blasted a settlement the
Justice Department had reached with
major trucking firms, some of which
are also defendants in Gould's suit.
The Justice Department had
brought suit against the truckers and
the Teamsters, charging discriminatory
practices.
Gould said the settlement was "less
than an arm's length deal. It was
clearly a deal between the Nixon
administration's Justice Department
and two of the administration's major
supporters in the 1972 election."
Inadequate Agreement
It was "one of the most inadequate
civil rights agreements ever reached"
by the government, said Gould. While
the truckers have agreed to hire more
minority workers as a part of the
settlement, the provisions for back pay
were inadequate and there were no
punitive damages imposed, he said.
Gould felt that "our litigation had
something to do with these minimal
concessions." He said the truckers
would probably bring the settlement
before Schnacke and assert that it
disposes of Gould's suit.
While the truckers admitted no
guilt in making the settlement, Gould
said that "they wouldn't have done it
unless there was something rotten in
Denmark."
