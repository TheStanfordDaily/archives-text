### DON COX 
Following oral arguments on March
15 and 21, U.S. District Court Judge
Robert Schnacke redefined a court
order on Law Prof. William Gould
restricting communication concerning
the $50 million class action he has
brought against trucking firms and the
Teamsters.
The new order eases previous
restrictions and opens some new
avenues of communication, but is still

The order was imposed following
complaints by the defendants'
attorneys that Gould was engaged in
the unethical solicitation of clients.
Gould has maintained that he was
only trying to collect necessary

behalf of eight minority truck drivers,
charges the defendants have engaged in
discriminatory hiring practices.

tell the court who in a "specific class"
he is communicating with or he must
sav in what context he contacted

members of the class.
"Presumably [the class] refers to
applicants and employees of the
trucking companies," Gould said.
Gould said they had "no present
plans" to appeal the order, but that
they would if "it becomes necessary."
Will Obey Order
Gould said that the order was
"confusing" but that he would obey
it.
"We have been communicating in
accordance with the order and wfll do
so in the future," he said.
"We will never take any avenue,
however, in which we would turn over
the names of those we are contacting,"
in efforts to obtain evidence of
discriminatory practioes, Gould said.
To do so would expose witnesses to
"retaliation" by the firms or unions
besides being unconstitutional, he said.
Gould's Charges
Gould charged that the defendants'
attorneys were trying to "slow down"
and "destroy the proceedings" but
that their strategy would "misfire and
only increase the liability of their
