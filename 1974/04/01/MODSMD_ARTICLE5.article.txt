# Law Officials Continue Taylor Murder Probe
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
San Mateo County sheriffs officers
are still investigating the March 24
murder of Janet Ann Taylor, 21, who
was strangled after leaving the
Stanford campus.
Taylor, daughter of former Athletic
Director Charles A. (Chuck) Taylor,
was apparently hitchhiking back to her
La Honda home after visiting friends
on the campus Sunday night.
She was last seen arount 7 p.m. at
the intersection of Mayfield Avenue
and Junipero Serra Boulevard. Her
body was discovered early next
morning in a roadside ditch on Sand
Hill Road near Manzanita Way, about
three miles from the campus.

A team of Explorer Scouts was to
have combed the area Saturday
searching for clues to the slaying.
However, San Mateo County Sheriffs
Inspector Rudy Siemssen, who is
heading the investigation, could not be
reached for comment yesterday about
whether the search had turned up any
new information.
Sunday Visit
Taylor had been on the campus
Sunday to visit Debbie Adams,
daughter of Dwight Adams, the
University's recently retired director
of facilities planning.
Authorities believe that after
leaving the Adams home at 524
Gerona Rd., Taylor walked up Gerona
to Junipero Serra, and down Serra to
Mayfield, where she was last seen at
7:05 p.m. A witness who saw her then
said she was gone by 7:35 p.m.
Investigators were reportedly
exploring several possible leads in the
case, including a report that a witness
saw a nervous man standing next to a
white 1964 Pontiac Catalina at about
12:15 a.m. not far from the spot
where the body was later found.
The witness reportedly stopped and
asked if the man had any problems
with his car. The man said he did not,
and the witness drove off.
Perlov Murder Link?
The Taylor murder sparked
renewed interest in the still-unsolved
Feb. 13, 1973 slaying of Leslie Marie
Perlov, 21, whose body was discovered
Feb. 16 at the site of the Old Quarry
near the intersection of Stanford
Avenue and the Foothill
Expressway—less than a mile from the
spot where Taylor was last seen
hitchhiking.
Perlov, a Stanford graduate who
lived in Los Altos and worked at the
North County Law Library in Palo

Alto, was discovered by mounted
searchers after authorities found her
abandoned auto parked at the quarry
gate.
Both women were
strangled—Taylor by hand and Perlov
with a scarf —and neither had been
sexually molested. Both were barefoot
when their bodies were found, and
both had been wearing raincoats. Both
women had been carrying purses,
which were not found with the bodies.
San Mateo County and Santa Clara
County investigators have conferred
on a possible link between the two
murders, but so far no such
connection has been made public.
'No Motive'
"We really don't know who we're
looking for," Siemssen told the Palo
Alto Times last week. "We have no
motive. She apparently had no money
in her purse, although you could
speculate that robbery was a motive.
It's a rough one."
Siemssen has asked anyone who
might have seen Taylor Sunday
evening to contact him at the San
Mateo County Sheriffs Office in
Redwood City, 364-1811.
Taylor had been a student at
Canada College in Redwood City until
she left school in January. She began
work two weeks ago at Oceanside,
Inc., a Palo Alto maritime information
firm.
Taylor's parents live in Atherton.
Her father was an Ail-American
football player in the early 1940s who
served as head football coach here
from 1951 to 1957, as assistant
athletic director from 1957 to 1963,
and athletic director from 1963 to
1972.
Besides her parents, the victim is
survived by a brother and a sister.
