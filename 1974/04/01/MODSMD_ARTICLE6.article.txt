# Former Dean Of Admissions
## Snyder: A True University Man 
### BOB LOWE 
Do institutions exist for men or do
men exist for institutions?
Occasionally — as with Assoc. History
Prof. Rixford K. Snyder and Stanford
University — the two are so
intertwined that they appear to exist
for each other.
When Snyder retires in June, he will
have devoted 36 of his 65 years to the
University as an instructor, dean of
admissions and director of continuing
education for the Alumni Association.
If his undergraduate and graduate
years here are included, the total
comes to 42 years.
During his long tenure, Snyder has
assumed a variety of roles. He's made
transitions from teacher to
administrator and from student
oriented jobs to an alumni-centered
post. And, as the University had
changed, he's had to change with it.
The common thread connecting the
different worlds he has moved through
is his fierce dedication to Stanford.
History Prof. Wayne Vucinich,
Snyder's former colleague and long
time friend said, "If you punctured
him, Stanford red would flow."
Sitting behind his desk at the
Bowman Alumni House, Snyder looks
less like associate professor of history
than his title indicates and more like a
businessman. He wears a colorfully

patterned shirt and tie, and enjoys a
picture-window view of the attractive
garden outside his spacious office.
Looks Young
He looks younger than 65.
Although he is balding and has
developed a bit of a double chin,
Snyder walks with the light step and
speaks with the energy of a younger
man. His deep, strong voice is assertive
and he gestures emphatically with
both hands to illustrate a point.
The long and happy
Stanford-Snyder relationship began
when he entered the University as a
freshman in 1926.
With interruptions for work (during
the Depression) and a world war,
Snyder received his Ph.D. in history in
1940 and became an assistant
professor in 1946.
Popular Teacher
He was a popular instructor.
According to Vucinich, inquisitive
students frequently "mobbed him
after his lectures." Snyder said that he
attempted to help students gain more
from his classes than just preparation

for the future, and geared them
toward "teaching how to live and not
how to make a living."
While he was in the history
department, Snyder edited a book
with History Professor George Knoles
entitled Readings in Western
Civilization which is still a textbook at
some colleges.
In 1950 Snyder abandoned the
world of teaching and a career as a
historian to assume the position of
Director of Admissions (renamed Dean
of Admissions in 1965), created only
two years earlier. He held that post for
19 years of its 26-year existence,
admitting 20 freshmen classes and
some 30,000 students to the
University.
One Million Ants
Snyder leans back in his chair,
laughs deeply, and tells about the high
school applicant who had collected
and counted one million ants for a
laboratory project. "He did this by
organizing fellow students who
gathered 10,000 ants each." Snyder
