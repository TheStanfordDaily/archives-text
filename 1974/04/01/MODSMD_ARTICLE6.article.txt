# Former Dean Of Admissions
## Snyder: A True University Man 
### BOB LOWE 
Do institutions exist for men or do
men exist for institutions?
Occasionally — as with Assoc. History
Prof. Rixford K. Snyder and Stanford
University — the two are so
intertwined that they appear to exist
for each other.
When Snyder retires in June, he will
have devoted 36 of his 65 years to the
University as an instructor, dean of
admissions and director of continuing
education for the Alumni Association.
If his undergraduate and graduate
years here are included, the total
comes to 42 years.
During his long tenure, Snyder has
assumed a variety of roles. He's made
transitions from teacher to
administrator and from student
oriented jobs to an alumni-centered
post. And, as the University had
changed, he's had to change with it.
The common thread connecting the
different worlds he has moved through
is his fierce dedication to Stanford.
History Prof. Wayne Vucinich,
Snyder's former colleague and long
time friend said, "If you punctured
him, Stanford red would flow."
Sitting behind his desk at the
Bowman Alumni House, Snyder looks
less like associate professor of history
than his title indicates and more like a
businessman. He wears a colorfully

patterned shirt and tie, and enjoys a
picture-window view of the attractive
garden outside his spacious office.
Looks Young
He looks younger than 65.
Although he is balding and has
developed a bit of a double chin,
Snyder walks with the light step and
speaks with the energy of a younger
man. His deep, strong voice is assertive
and he gestures emphatically with
both hands to illustrate a point.
The long and happy
Stanford-Snyder relationship began
when he entered the University as a
freshman in 1926.
With interruptions for work (during
the Depression) and a world war,
Snyder received his Ph.D. in history in
1940 and became an assistant
professor in 1946.
Popular Teacher
He was a popular instructor.
According to Vucinich, inquisitive
students frequently "mobbed him
after his lectures." Snyder said that he
attempted to help students gain more
from his classes than just preparation

for the future, and geared them
toward "teaching how to live and not
how to make a living."
While he was in the history
department, Snyder edited a book
with History Professor George Knoles
entitled Readings in Western
Civilization which is still a textbook at
some colleges.
In 1950 Snyder abandoned the
world of teaching and a career as a
historian to assume the position of
Director of Admissions (renamed Dean
of Admissions in 1965), created only
two years earlier. He held that post for
19 years of its 26-year existence,
admitting 20 freshmen classes and
some 30,000 students to the
University.
One Million Ants
Snyder leans back in his chair,
laughs deeply, and tells about the high
school applicant who had collected
and counted one million ants for a
laboratory project. "He did this by
organizing fellow students who
gathered 10,000 ants each." Snyder

HARVESTING NEW CROP—Former Admissions Dean Rixford Snyder, who for
19 years culled a new freshman class from those who applied, has announced his
retirement in June from the University.
says, "We thought this showed an
intense, organizational ability." The
applicant was accepted.
Every year, after acceptance and
rejection notices were sent to
candidates, angry phone calls poured
in from disgruntled parents and
alumni. Snyder labels this time the
"rejection period." It was then that "I
would have liked to quit," he said.
Snyder described the job of
Director of Admissions as very
"tense." This was especially true
during the middle and late sixties,
when students who were "placid and
unconcerned" were replaced by those
who were "much more part of the
action."
Pressures To Change
As the campus changed, some
admissions practices, such as minority
policies, were pressured to change also.
Snyder admits that it was difficult to
adjust to all the new ideas.
"My training was for a different
era," he said. "A younger man might
have made the adjustment better."
In 1969 Snyder decided to leave the
Admissions office and moved to his
present post with the Alumni
Association. Getting out of the
"pressure cooker" was a welcome
change, he said.
Alumni College Abroad
Snyder organized Alumni College
Abroad, a program designed to give
Alumni the opportunity to travel to
selected areas ail over the world. The
"colleges" are short excursions —
usually lasting two weeks — with one
or more professors who lecture on
different aspects of the region.
While he misses the interaction he
had with students as Director of
Admissions, Snyder finds that his
present job is natural for him because
he loves to travel and has established
connections with thousands of alumni
over the years he's been here.
Leads Groups
He leads groups on three different
trips every year to regions ranging
from Thailand to the Danube River.
Last January he led one "college" to
various locations in Egypt and sailed
up the Nile River to the Aswan Dam.
After retirement, Snyder wants to
stay busy and continue leading the
program as a consultant to the
University. He is already planning trips
on the Amazon River and in the Black
Sea area for 1975.
"Retirement isn't going to be a
milestone," Snyder said. But, he does
hope to have more time to write
historical articles and contribute more
in his position as trustee of Menlo
College.
Home Life
Snyder lives on campus with his
wife, Elliott, in an attractive

high-ceiling house, located in a
residential area behind the women's
gym. They built the house 25 years
ago. Today, it is a veritable museum,
filled with momentos and handicraft
from all over the world.
The Snyders lead an active life.
They frequently attend Stanford
sporting and music events and set aside
an hour every day for walks in the hills
behind Stanford. Snyder enjoys
working in his backyard garden where
he has a collection of rose bushes,
tulips, gladiolas, daffodils and other
flowers.
Wherever he is, Snyder won't be
too far away from Stanford. Just as
the University has become what it is,
partially due to him, Stanford is a part
of Rixford Snyder.
