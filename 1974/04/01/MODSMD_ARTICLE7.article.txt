# USE Proposal
## 
### 
Julio Harvey

The University administration,
through its spokesman, Dougla. l
Barton, objects to Unitec
Stanford Employees' proposal to
limit people outside the
bargaining unit from regularly
performing work done by
employees in the bargaining unit.
He cites, as an example, that a
professor may be prohibited from
doing work routinely assigned to a
technician. I submit that he need
not be concerned, for the
professor seldom has the time to
devote to acquire the skills
performed better by the
technician.
There is little danger that the
professor or other higher paid
employees outside the bargaining
unit will take over the technicians'
job for the technicians do highly
skilled work but get less wages
than unskilled labor in the
community. The danger lies rather
in the technician of lower salary
replacing the higher paid
employee such as research
assistant, as currently manipulated
in the Medical School.
Protect Workers' Jobs
USE's restrictive proposal is
made to protect workers'
jobs including those employees
outside the bargaining unit.
Barton's example is a red herring
having nothing to do with the
issue.
Barton further objects to
USE's proposal because he claims
that it would prevent students
from getting jobs. Of course, we
cannot allow jobs to be taken
away from workers and given to
students. Administrators may very
well wish to do so — for
professedly humane reasons. But
could the real reason be that
student labor is cheap labor?
The Union cannot allow cheap
labor for it would undermine and
keep down the wages of all
workers. However, the student
who does the same work as a
worker is a worker. If the
University would agree to abide

by the principle of "equal pay for
equal work" a solution can be
worked out that would be of
benefit to the student and the
worker.
Shop Agreement Refused
In the name of protecting
those workers who did not vote
for the Union, the University
refuses to consider a union
security or agency shop
agreement. Instead it proposes a
"maintenance of membership"
provision. This means that only
those workers who are now
members (70 percent of the
bargaining unit) must retain union
membership.
Very clever! Every anti-union
employer will settle for this clause
when confronted with union
organization. Why? New
employees and others not now in
the union will benefit from the
work done by the Union without
joining it. Employers hope these
workers will not join. With
usual employment turnover, the
"maintenance of membership"
provision is designed to dissolve
the union organization in time.
Administration Innocent
I would not accuse our
paternalistic administration or its
liberal representatives of
harboring such ulterior motives
for I know that they seek only to
protect non-union workers. But
judging from Barton's
background, he is fully aware that
USE cannot agree to contribute to
its own dissolution and leave the
workers helpless and defenseless.
Only by refusing to accept this
or any other provision that would
weaken our bargaining power in
the future can U.S.E. build a
strong unified organization. Only
thus will we have the might tc
overcome the overwhelmin|
economic power of the University
and guarantee the achievement of
our goals.

"maintenance of membership"
provision is designed to dissolve
the union organization in time.
Administration Innocent
I would not accuse our
paternalistic administration or its
liberal representatives of
harboring such ulterior motives
for I know that they seek only to
protect non-union workers. But
judging from Barton's
background, he is fully aware that
USE cannot agree to contribute to
its own dissolution and leave the
workers helpless and defenseless.
Only by refusing to accept this
or any other provision that would
weaken our bargaining power in
the future can U.S.E. build a
strong unified organization. Only
thus will we have the might tc
overcome the overwhelmin|
economic power of the University
and guarantee the achievement of
our goals.

The University administration,
through its spokesman, Dougla. l
Barton, objects to Unitec
Stanford Employees' proposal to
limit people outside the
bargaining unit from regularly
performing work done by
employees in the bargaining unit.
He cites, as an example, that a
professor may be prohibited from
doing work routinely assigned to a
technician. I submit that he need
not be concerned, for the
professor seldom has the time to
devote to acquire the skills
performed better by the
technician.
There is little danger that the
professor or other higher paid
employees outside the bargaining
unit will take over the technicians'
job for the technicians do highly
skilled work but get less wages
than unskilled labor in the
community. The danger lies rather
in the technician of lower salary
replacing the higher paid
employee such as research
assistant, as currently manipulated
in the Medical School.
Protect Workers' Jobs
USE's restrictive proposal is
made to protect workers'
jobs including those employees
outside the bargaining unit.
Barton's example is a red herring
having nothing to do with the
issue.
Barton further objects to
USE's proposal because he claims
that it would prevent students
from getting jobs. Of course, we
cannot allow jobs to be taken
away from workers and given to
students. Administrators may very
well wish to do so — for
professedly humane reasons. But
could the real reason be that
student labor is cheap labor?
The Union cannot allow cheap
labor for it would undermine and
keep down the wages of all
workers. However, the student
who does the same work as a
worker is a worker. If the
University would agree to abide

by the principle of "equal pay for
equal work" a solution can be
worked out that would be of
benefit to the student and the
worker.
Shop Agreement Refused
In the name of protecting
those workers who did not vote
for the Union, the University
refuses to consider a union
security or agency shop
agreement. Instead it proposes a
"maintenance of membership"
provision. This means that only
those workers who are now
members (70 percent of the
bargaining unit) must retain union
membership.
Very clever! Every anti-union
employer will settle for this clause
when confronted with union
organization. Why? New
employees and others not now in
the union will benefit from the
work done by the Union without
joining it. Employers hope these
workers will not join. With
usual employment turnover, the
"maintenance of membership"
provision is designed to dissolve
the union organization in time.
