Corporate Reports
Editor:
Many corporations hold their
annual meetings in the spring of
the year. May I suggest to your
readership that they open up
those annual reports and read
them carefully. Find out if there
are any women on the Board of
Directors (probably the
answer is no), or in top
management positions.
If you are interested in equal
rights and opportunities for
women, consider writing to those
corporations of which you are an
owner, and inquiring how many
women are in top, middle, lower
management positions, how many
women are employed by the
company, and the total number of
employees in the corporation. Ask
questions and seek complete
answers.
If the owners of companies fail
to ask management these
questions and fail to indicate their
concerns to management, then the
owners tacitly accept the status
quo, i.e., unequal access to
employment opportunities which
may be occurring in the
companies they support by
owning shares.
I encourage this paper tc
participate in raising these
questions by investigating the
prevailing practices of the
corporations in the area. I think
all of us will find the experience
revealing, and it may result in
encouraging companies to
re-examine their corporate
policies concerning the status of
women.

'One More Year'?
Editor:
After reading Dave Robinson's
Ziegler-esque column ("Shuffling
the Cards," Daily, March 14), I
feel compelled to amend my
previous letter (Daily, March 6).
Not only should Howie
Dallmar do the University a favor
and resign, Robinson should
hasten to follow suit.
The last thing any newspaper
needs is a columnist who serves as
an apologist for ineptitude - even
ineptitude under the guise of
"maturity." it is just this sort of
writing which has helped
perpetuate twenty years of small
crowds, disheartened players, and
atrocious basketball at Stanford.
There is no hope of relief so long
as Robinson continues to lead
cheers of "One more year."
I would rather read what Milt
Kahn has to say.

This letter is written pursuant
to a formal resolution of the
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation
(CAPER), commending the Daily
for its excellent sports coverage so
far this academic year.
The Committee is unanimous
in its praise for the Daily's efforts
in covering so-called minor sports
and for giving appropriate,
increased attention to women's
sports.
We certainly hope that this
type of coverage will be continued
in the future.

far this academic year.
The Committee is unanimous
in its praise for the Daily's efforts
in covering so-called minor sports
and for giving appropriate,
increased attention to women's
sports.
We certainly hope that this
type of coverage will be continued
in the future.

Corporate Reports
Editor:
Many corporations hold their
annual meetings in the spring of
the year. May I suggest to your
readership that they open up
those annual reports and read
them carefully. Find out if there
are any women on the Board of
Directors (probably the
answer is no), or in top
management positions.
If you are interested in equal
rights and opportunities for
women, consider writing to those
corporations of which you are an
owner, and inquiring how many
women are in top, middle, lower
management positions, how many
women are employed by the
company, and the total number of
employees in the corporation. Ask
questions and seek complete
answers.
If the owners of companies fail
to ask management these
questions and fail to indicate their
concerns to management, then the
owners tacitly accept the status
quo, i.e., unequal access to
employment opportunities which
may be occurring in the
companies they support by
owning shares.
I encourage this paper tc
participate in raising these
questions by investigating the
prevailing practices of the
corporations in the area. I think
all of us will find the experience
revealing, and it may result in
encouraging companies to
re-examine their corporate
policies concerning the status of
women.

'One More Year'?
Editor:
After reading Dave Robinson's
Ziegler-esque column ("Shuffling
the Cards," Daily, March 14), I
feel compelled to amend my
previous letter (Daily, March 6).
Not only should Howie
Dallmar do the University a favor
and resign, Robinson should
hasten to follow suit.
The last thing any newspaper
needs is a columnist who serves as
an apologist for ineptitude - even
ineptitude under the guise of
"maturity." it is just this sort of
writing which has helped
perpetuate twenty years of small
crowds, disheartened players, and
atrocious basketball at Stanford.
There is no hope of relief so long
as Robinson continues to lead
cheers of "One more year."
I would rather read what Milt
Kahn has to say.
