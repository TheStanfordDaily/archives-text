# Six Slates, Amendments Confront ASSU Voters
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Students will elect a new ASSU
Council of Presidents and vote on
ASSU constitutional changes and fee
assessments during the second and
third weeks of this month.
Six slates of candidates have
collected the necessary signatures to
place themselves on the primary ballot
April 10 and 11. In the order they'll
appear on the ballot, the slates are:
—800 Bacon, member of the ASSU
Committee on Public Events, editor of
the Real News and ASSU Senate
alternate; Chris Baron, director of the
Prison Information Center and
chairman of the SWOPSI board; Maria
Echaveste, ASSU senator and
co-chairman of MECHA; and Jack
Handy, chairman of the Stanford
chapter of the Northern California
Public Interest Research Group
(Nor-Cal PIRG) and former ASSU
assistant elections commissioner.
—Chris Murray, founder of the

Associated Stanford Students for
Action, a group designed to improve
student government; Chip Underwood,
ASSU senator; Paul Voger, sophomore
in economics; and Marion Chung,
junior in human biology.
—Bruce Smyth, ASSU senator; Liz
Kincannon, biology; Ed Delßeccarro,
undeclared; and Rick Chavez,
psychology.
—Jim Aleveras, junior in
psychology; Caroline Fouts,
sophomore in physics; Jason Chang,
junior in mathematics; and Ed
Anderson, junior in economics and
political science.
—Mike Herman, two-year ASSU
senator and member of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies and former
member of the ASSU Nominations
Committee; Ann Carter, financial
manager of the ASSU Course Review
and Senate alternate; Len Mackey,
second year law student serving as a
senator; and Quinn Mayer, ASSU

senator, member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids and of the
subcommittee of the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement.
—Leo Ramek, junior in human
biology, and John Artell, sophomore
with an undeclared major.
Also put to vote on April 10 and 11
will be the ASSU Program Fee
Assessment. This $1 fee will be used to
support various campus groups and
publications. A breakdown of this
assessment is available in the ASSU
office, according to ASSU Financial
Manager, Dave Martin.
Petitions for the individual fee
assessments have not yet been turned
in, Martin said. These $1 fees will be
voted upon April 17 and 18. So far,
incumbent ASSU President Kevin
O'Grady has said he will propose
assessments to support the ASSU
Legal Counseling Office and the
Stanford chapter of the Nor-Cal PIRG.
ASSU officials were uncertain
about which week the constitutional
changes would be voted upon. In
effect, these changes will change the
Senate elections from fall to spring
quarter. They will also create a better
way to remove negligent members of
the ASSU Committee on Nominations.
Senate Chairman Reggie Turner
explained that, if the elections change
is approved, the Senate elections will
still be held in the fall and spring next
year. After that, he explained, the
election would occur in the spring the
same date as the presidential election.
