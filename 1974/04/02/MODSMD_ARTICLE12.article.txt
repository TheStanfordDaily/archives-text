# Walk For Mankind On Saturday
## 
### 
Steve Brinn

Maira Sandrez is a 7'/2-year-old girl from
San Pedro Sula, Honduras, whose neck and
chest were welded together three years ago
by burns of an unknown cause. She never
had surgical attention simply because of
poverty. Maira's parents do not have the
money it takes to employ the services of the
country's few doctors who live in the cities.
When she came to Project Concern Maira
had lived half her life looking at the ground
or straining to look up like normal people.
She could see all right. She knew when it was
a bright day or when it was a dark one. But
she could not see the blue skies or even the
clouds.
Worse than that, Maira could not play all
the games children her age should. And it did
not escape Maira's friends at school that she
was different. "How funny," they thought,
"that she always looks at the ground."
Walk For Mankind
The Walk for Mankind is something
Stanford students can do the first week of
their spring quarter for Maira, and for others
like her. By walking they can help bring a life
into focus. The money raised by the Palo
Alto Walk for Mankind the past three years
has made possible reconstructive surgery for
more than 500 patients bearing the mark of
gross burns or deformity.
It is noteworthy that Stanford students
are patently absent from the Walk's
supporters, even though it has been directed
by Stanford students the past three years, the
surgeries are the work of Stanford surgeons,
and the Walk annually begins and ends on the
Stanford campus.
Is it oelow their level of intellectual
pretension? On a campus regrettably vacant

of social concerns, one wonders why an
upper-class, leisure-oriented student
population won't take the first Saturday of
Spring quarter and walk twenty miles with
the area high schoolers and senior citizens to
pay for Maira's surgeries. I think it is a sorry
commentary on the social irresponsibility or
this country's "elite."
Fifty Victims
Fifty victims of congenital deformity and
burns could be restored to meaningful social
life this year if the Walk raises its projected
$20,000. The patients are flown to Stanford
hospital free of charge by a California airline.
They are received into volunteer homes in
the area, where they stay during treatment
and convalescence. All surgeons' fees are
waived. In short, the one necessary expense is
the rental fee for operating and
post-operative rooms in the Stanford
Hospital. The Walk for Mankind pays it.
If there is a Stanford student who would
like to help, the Walk for Mankind this year
will cover a course of twenty miles, passing
through Stanford, Los Altos Hills, Los Altos,
Mountain View, Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Walkers can begin at Maples Pavilion on the
Stanford University campus any time after
8:30 a.m. and before noon on Saturday,
April 6.
There is no minimum walking distance; a
walker may quit anywhere along the route.
Food and drink will be provided at several
points on the course, and Power Sound
Service of Palo Alto is volunteering an
acoustical guitar and rock music concert
afterwards, starting at 3 p.m.
Walk Is Unique
The Palo Alto Walk for Mankind is unique

in that the entire sum of its proceeds support
a project operating in this area. Stanford
students raise money in support of relief
work being done by Stanford people.
Before the Walk the walker must find
persons to sponsor him for each mile he
walks. A dime or a nickel will do. Anything.
After the Walk the walker will visit these
people again, collect his pledges from them
and mail the sum in the form of a check
payable to Project Concern's Walk for
Mankind, Box 5350, Stanford, Ca. 94305.
Cash may also be delivered to the
Department of Plastic Surgery, Stanford
Hospital.
Project Concern asks Stanford students
once again to take some steps for another
human being. In this case your ability to
think is worth less than nothing without an
equal willingness to do. Try it for a change.
Give Project Concern a call at 321-1200 Ext.
6491. Maira needs you, and you may just
discover that you need her.

quarter.)

the area, where they stay during treatment
and convalescence. All surgeons' fees are
waived. In short, the one necessary expense is
the rental fee for operating and
post-operative rooms in the Stanford
Hospital. The Walk for Mankind pays it.
If there is a Stanford student who would
like to help, the Walk for Mankind this year
will cover a course of twenty miles, passing
through Stanford, Los Altos Hills, Los Altos,
Mountain View, Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Walkers can begin at Maples Pavilion on the
Stanford University campus any time after
8:30 a.m. and before noon on Saturday,
April 6.
There is no minimum walking distance; a
walker may quit anywhere along the route.
Food and drink will be provided at several
points on the course, and Power Sound
Service of Palo Alto is volunteering an
acoustical guitar and rock music concert
afterwards, starting at 3 p.m.
Walk Is Unique
The Palo Alto Walk for Mankind is unique

in that the entire sum of its proceeds support
a project operating in this area. Stanford
students raise money in support of relief
work being done by Stanford people.
Before the Walk the walker must find
persons to sponsor him for each mile he
walks. A dime or a nickel will do. Anything.
After the Walk the walker will visit these
people again, collect his pledges from them
and mail the sum in the form of a check
payable to Project Concern's Walk for
Mankind, Box 5350, Stanford, Ca. 94305.
Cash may also be delivered to the
Department of Plastic Surgery, Stanford
Hospital.
Project Concern asks Stanford students
once again to take some steps for another
human being. In this case your ability to
think is worth less than nothing without an
equal willingness to do. Try it for a change.

discover that you need her.
(Steve Brinn graduated from Stanford last
quarter.)
Steve Brinn

Maira Sandrez is a 7'/2-year-old girl from
San Pedro Sula, Honduras, whose neck and
chest were welded together three years ago
by burns of an unknown cause. She never
had surgical attention simply because of
poverty. Maira's parents do not have the
money it takes to employ the services of the
country's few doctors who live in the cities.
When she came to Project Concern Maira
had lived half her life looking at the ground
or straining to look up like normal people.
She could see all right. She knew when it was
a bright day or when it was a dark one. But
she could not see the blue skies or even the
clouds.
Worse than that, Maira could not play all
the games children her age should. And it did
not escape Maira's friends at school that she
was different. "How funny," they thought,
"that she always looks at the ground."
Walk For Mankind
The Walk for Mankind is something
Stanford students can do the first week of
their spring quarter for Maira, and for others
like her. By walking they can help bring a life
into focus. The money raised by the Palo
Alto Walk for Mankind the past three years
has made possible reconstructive surgery for
more than 500 patients bearing the mark of
gross burns or deformity.
It is noteworthy that Stanford students
are patently absent from the Walk's
supporters, even though it has been directed
by Stanford students the past three years, the
surgeries are the work of Stanford surgeons,
and the Walk annually begins and ends on the
Stanford campus.
Is it oelow their level of intellectual
pretension? On a campus regrettably vacant

of social concerns, one wonders why an
upper-class, leisure-oriented student
population won't take the first Saturday of
Spring quarter and walk twenty miles with
the area high schoolers and senior citizens to
pay for Maira's surgeries. I think it is a sorry
commentary on the social irresponsibility or
this country's "elite."
Fifty Victims
Fifty victims of congenital deformity and
burns could be restored to meaningful social
life this year if the Walk raises its projected
$20,000. The patients are flown to Stanford
hospital free of charge by a California airline.
They are received into volunteer homes in
the area, where they stay during treatment
and convalescence. All surgeons' fees are
waived. In short, the one necessary expense is
the rental fee for operating and
