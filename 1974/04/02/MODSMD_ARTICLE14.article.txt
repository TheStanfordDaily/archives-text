# Life, Learning And Human Ecology

Since I've been reading recent
issues of the Daily, my thoughts
have taken many avenues in
realizing the meaning of what is
happening with correction
(confinement) of offenders
(prisoners) in today's society.
The diseases of today's society
have stemmed from a viral
infection that has been with us
since the beginning of time, when
the first caveman stole food from
a rival. Today it's the Hearst
kidnaping, previously it was the
Boston Strangler, the tower
assassin of Texas, and on and on.
We spend billions on new
mechanisms to destroy whole
nations, spend millions
maintaining a government that
steals and lies to us. And we praise
a suicidal system which still works
on the premise of punishment
rather than seeking a true means
of prevention.
Human Resources
Essentially what I'm into is
human ecology — men and
women in prison as a resource
desperately needing to be
recycled, if for no other reason
than that they're human. Society
spends about $110 million to
maintain a system to confine most
of its criminal offenders. But
upon release 75 percent fail and
return to prison.
Why? I wonder myself, having
personally failed several times.
We become what we learn, and
people who go to prison learn to
do "wrong" things — just as
others learn to live their lives the
other way. We don't necessarily
enjoy being the outcasts of
today's world, but it's easiest to

continue doing what you know
best.
Sitting in a cell, I have often
wondered just how difficult it
would be to put a little money
into saving men and women in
prison, just as we save those with
serious mental or physical
problems.
Equality Necessary
Are we any less valuable as
people? We feel just as everyone
else does. They ask us to donate

our blood in national emergencies,
some of us give our lives fighting
fires that we didn't start, and
there are many of us who would
gladly put our lives on the line in
the interest of medical
advancement.
When is our turn? Who will say
"I'll help," and then do
something, rather than talk?
We can't vote, we have no
control over who is guiding our
lives in that big castle in Sacto. It

is a sad state of affairs when we
see ignorance dictating to the
masses, who don't know any
better than to wonder at all this. I
guess politicians learned from
people too, and they just go on
doing what they know best. ...
I get this feeling that I'm
wasting a stamp, but I hope not.
Maybe someone will hear
something of what's here.
