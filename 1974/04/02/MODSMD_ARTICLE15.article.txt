their own profits.
The police have joined in the act, refusing even
to attempt to capture the unclad lawbreakers. I
urge the Stanford community not to be duped by
this silent conspiracy, and instead to put public
pressure on city and University officials to enforce,
to the letter, anti-streaking laws (such as public
indecency, pornography, disturbing the peace,
mayhem, public gathering prohibitions and many
more).
Hopefully, new specific anti-streaking provisions
will be passed to meet this crisis. We should work
for their furtherance. The only streak I can see is
the blind streak in the legislature's vision which has
prevented them from acting promptly.
Be frigidly contemptuous when confronted; and
work for full enforcement of present-day laws and
passage of new, specific anti-streaking laws, and
we'll defeat this flu which has invaded the nation's
system.
(Rand Burnett is a resident of Palo Alto.)

I would like to urge the members of the
Stanford community not to "streak," and indeed,
not to encourage "streakers" in any way, form,
shape or manner, i.e., by staring, laughing, giggling
or reacting in any way at all. "Streaking" should be
encountered by the utmost of silent contempt.
It should be noted that "streaking" has
undoubtedly been instigated by a conspiracy, at
home and abroad, to undermine the morals and
morale of this country. What sort of twisted,
distorted view of the world will a four-year old
little girl obtain if she, by another's supposed
"prankstering," gets a shocking surprise about the
true disgusting nature of the world around us?
What will be the reaction of an eager 15-year old
girl? As for the male members of the populace, do
they not risk irreparable damage? By
over-publicizing and thereby helping to spread and
encourage this sick fad, the Eastern Establishment
press and electronics news media have tried to
divert the country's attention from the oil
companies' manipulation of our government for
Rand Burnett i
