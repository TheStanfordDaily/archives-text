# Sterling And Libraries

The record of Stanford's
growth and achievements under
the administration of President
Sterling, as depicted by Jim
Wascher (Daily, March 14), is
incomplete without some note of
what happened to the University
Libraries during that period.
Having arrived on the campus just
in time for Sterling's inauguration,
and thus having been associated
with the University Libraries
during his entire tenure, I feel the
omission with special keenness.
When President Sterling
entered upon his duties, the
library staff throughout the
University shared fully the
generally low morale mentioned
by Dr. Terman. Insupportably low
salaries, book funds tragically
deficient, standards of service that
had been deteriorating
progressively for two decades
before the appointment of Dr.
R.C. Swank as Director in 1948,
inadequate building maintenance,
antiquated and worn-out
equipment (at one time over half
the typewriters in the Catalog
Division were over twenty years
old) — all these and other equally
distressing factors hampered the
work and depressed the spirits of
the library staff.
It is impossible to detail here
all the accomplishments of
Sterling's nineteen year
administration. But some idea of
them may be gleaned from a few
statistics showing increases in
important aspects of library
activity.
Annual Report
The Annual Report of the
Director of Libraries provides the
following figures, the first as of
Aug. 31, 1949, the second as of
Aug. 31, 1968, at the end of the
Sterling era. They are for all the
libraries of the University.
Volumes in libraries: 1,556,903 to
3,071,372; volumes added during
the year: 43,912 to 163,111;
professional staff: 46 to 139; total
staff: 132 to 426; expenditures on
books and journals: $175,398 to
$1,271,840; total expenditures:
$515,053 to $4,706,001.
Among the libraries newly
built, independently or as part of
larger building complexes, the
Lane Medical Library, the Meyer
Memorial Library, the Jackson
Library of Business, the Lou
Henry Hoover Building of the
Hoover Institution, the Branner
Earth Sciences, Falconer Biology,
Physics, and Computer Science
Libraries are especially notable.
Enlarged and refurnished library
quarters were included in the
remodeled school or
departmental buildings for
Chemistry, Philosophy,
Mathematical Sciences and
Political Science.
The University Archives and
the Archive of Recorded Sound
were established. In the internal
organization of the library system
innumerable changes occurred,
many of which required new
funding. The Main Library stacks
were completed, adding two full
levels of book space and 200 new
study spaces, and many old
libraries were repaired,
redecorated, and newly equipped.
Physical Aspects
These physical aspects of the
library system are the most
evident, but not necessarily the
most important signs of progress.
The immensely strengthened
collections in older disciplines, has
enabled the University to support
new programs — linguistics,
religious studies, a greatly
expanded Art Department,
including a library now among the
best in the nation, and a large
array of interdepartmental and
area programs of high reputation.
These have been made possible by
library support constantly
strengthened under President
Sterling's administration, with his
active encouragement and the
sympathetic understanding of his
colleagues and aides.
There can be no great
university without a great library;
as Stanford is recognized to be a
university of the first rank, the
library shares this distinction; as
President Sterling dedicated
himself to revitalizing and
rebuilding the University, he
performed the same office for its
libraries. Let it never be forgotten
by librarians, or by those who use
and benefit from Stanford's
libraries.
