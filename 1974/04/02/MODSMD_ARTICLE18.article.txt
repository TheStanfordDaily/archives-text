# Powerful Computers Survey SLAC Data
##

University News Service
The largest outpouring of
experimental data in the history
of physics will be gathered,
analyzed and monitored by a new
triplex system of high-powered
computers as it comes from
high-energy experiments at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), according to
scientists who look forward to
using the facilities.
Together the three computers
represent an investment of
approximately $18 million. They
are run seven days a week, 24
hours a day, by an operations
staff of 30 people.
With the addition of two new
IBM 370/168's to an existing
360/91, the system now has
memory banks totaling eight
million "bytes" or characters, said
Lyle B. Smith, assistant director
of the Stanford Center for
Information Processing (SCIP),
who oversees SLAC computing
services. SLAC consumes more
computer power than all other
groups at Stanford combined, he
added.

The new triplex system will
usher in a new era of high-speed
electronic physics at SLAC. The
physicists involved look forward
to being freed of much drudgery
of collecting data themselves and
personally feeding it into the
computer.
Increased computer power
became necessary to
accommodate such devices as
LASS (Large Aperture Solenoidal
Spectrometer) which will produce
up to 200,000 bytes per second.
LASS can track particles created
in experiments electronically,
then instantly transfer this
three-dimensional information to
the computers.
The computers partially
analyze the incoming data
simultaneously, so that physicists
can make changes in experiments
even while they are observing
them.
Another experimental facility
that recently began to generate
huge amounts of data is SLAC's
electron-positron storage ring
(SPEAR), and additional
developments are due in the near
future. In the meantime the
360/91, installed in 1968, had
become "saturated," and
installation of the new triplex
system was essential to keep up
with the expanding volume of
data.
