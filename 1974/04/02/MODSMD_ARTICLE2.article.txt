# Flores Will Appeal Denial Of Tenure
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Marxist Juan Flores, assistant
professor of German studies, will
appeal a recent decision denying him
tenure to Vice President and Provost
William F. Miller. Unless the decision
is reversed, he will probably not be
rehired at the end of the 1974-75
school year.
In late February the Appointments
and Promotions Committee
recommended that tenure be denied.
Flores then received a letter from
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden which stated that his
work "does not indicate that he will
be a scholar of the level we expect for
a tenured member of the school's
faculty."
Flores believes, however, that the
real reason for the denial is "political
prejudice." He indicated that his
Marxist, revolutionary beliefs resulted
in Royden's decision, in spite of the
German Studies Department's
recommendation that tenure be
granted.
Eleven graduate students in German
Studies have sent a letter to the Dean's
office protesting the action. The letter
states that Royden's reasons for
denying tenure were "unsatisfactory"
and demands "an explanation of the
true reasons."
"Best Teacher"
One of the students, James
Coleman, described Flores as "the best
teacher I've had at Stanford." He
added that he "questioned the ability
of the committee to accurately
analyze his (Flores') work."
Although Flores wasn't completely
surprised by the Dean's action, he said
that he was "outraged" that "they

chose scholarship as the reason."
Flores has been an assistant
professor here for six years. During
that time he published a 350-page
book entitled Poetry in East Germany.
According to German professor Kurt
Mueller-Vollmer, this book "has
commanded the respect of the
national community of scholars."
Flores also published a review and
analysis of a prodigious Marxist work.
Apparently, the Appointment and
Promotions Committee and Royden
did not feel this was sufficient. Flores
said that Royden, in a private
discussion with him, said that his book
was based too heavilv on his
dissertation and that his article had
been received "ambiguously."
Not An Exception
Royden, who is staying at
Princeton University on sabbatical
during spring quarter, was not
available for comment. Acting Dean
Lawrence V. Ryan said that Flores
wasn't an exception and that many
other professors are denied tenure
after they have been recommended by
their departments.
He indicated that if the University
stops expanding, "your economics are
that you have fewer openings."
Flores is the only Marxist professor
in German Studies Department. He is
recognized as the only Stanford
professor specializing in East German
literature.
Woody Williams, a German Studies
graduate student, said that this
specialty makes Flores important to
the department. "It would be a shame
if Stanford forgot that East Germany
existed," he said.
