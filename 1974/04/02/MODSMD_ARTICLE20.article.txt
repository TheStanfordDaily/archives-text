# 'Maine' Can't Escape 'I Love Lucy'
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Mame and The Great Gatsby
have been selected by public and
promoters alike as the two early
entries in 1974's heavily
promoted movies with equally
heavy audience expectations.
The publicity makers for Mame
decided early in the game to let
the magic name of Lucy carry the
burden of the film's profitability,
or the onus for its losses. Lucille
Ball does try mightily, but she just
can't measure up to the previous
movie Mame, Rosalind Russell.
For those not familiar with the
best-selling book, the 1958 movie,
or the long-running Broadway
play based on zany, loveable
Mame â€” she is the only relative of
small, loveable Patrick Dennis.
Auntie Mame gets to bring the
boy up in a madcap world of the
1920s and 30s, freaky friends and
frivilous, fabulous parties.
Angela Lansbury had the
Mame role on Broadway, but
early in the movie production
discussions, it was decided that
the Lansbury name just wasn't

strong enough to entice the public
to see the movie version.
So, why not Lucille Ball, who
has been loved and re-loved as
Lucy by uncountable millions,
who is a successful
businesswoman, artful
comedienne, and who had been
known to sing and dance in her
earlier films.
Fortunately, most of the
remaining Broadway musical cast
was retained, for although Lucy
makes an acceptable Mame,
there's more Lucy in Mame than
vice versa.
Two bits in particular seem
right out of "I Love Lucy." In
the first, best friend, actress Vera
Charles, magnificently played by
Bea ("Maude") Arthur, obtains a
small role in a mediocre stage play
for Mame. Cast as the new moon,
all Mame/Lucy needs is husband
Ricky standing in the wings, when
she's through charming the
audience with her clowning.
Another Lucy-ish bit has Mame
selling shoes in a department store
(during the Depression years). She

accidentally meets and falls in
love with handsome and filthy
rich Beauregard Buenside as she
tries to sell him roller skates.
Mame tries them on for him, gets
fired by the floor manager, and
skates off in a huff, looking every
inch Lucy Ricardo.
But Mame eventually marries
Beauregard (Robert Preston),
meets his stiff-backed Georgia
relatives, and charms them right
out of their straight-laced ways.
This gives director Gene Saks a
chance to stage one of the most
over-blown numbers this side of
Barbara Streisand in Hello Dolly,
as a cast of hundreds, all dressed
in fox-hunting outfits, do a loony
dance in front of the Burnside
mansion and sing "Mame." The
best song in the musical ends up
looking like a 40-pound
overcooked turkey, dry and
devoide of any juice or pizzaz.
But another, less ambitiously
staged number between Vera and
Mame, "Bosom Buddies," is done
with wit and flair, as two
formidable talents (Ball and

Arthur) play against one another
to perfection.
It's this odd combination of
flatulence and fun that plagues
the movie throughout. Dirprtor
Saks, who has made a name for
himself translating Broadway
plays into movies (Barefoot in the
Park, The Odd Couple), seemed
confounded by the episodic
nature of the script, the presence
of Ms. Ball, and the money he was
given to make the film.
What comes out is at times
entertaining, but just as often,
disgustingly silly caricature.
There's too little attention paid to
Patrick's nurse, the funny, frumpy
Agnes Gooch, or Mame's bosom
buddy, Vera, or any number of
secondary characters. It's as if
Mame had been defined as the
center of the production by fiat,
rather than her certain unique
traits, and the emphasis on Mame
for Mame's sake, rather than for
the film's, is the most disturbing
flaw in the entire production.
From the ads in the papers and
on television, Mame is Lucy,

implying that the same sort of
relationship exists between the
two as James Bond/Sean Connery
or Amanda Blake/Miss Kitty. It
takes more than saying it to make
it so, however, and to tens of
millions, Lucille Ball is much
more Lucy Ricardo than Mame.
There's much more to Mame
than an elegantly coiffed and
dressed Lucy, which is all this
version gives the audience.
Without the burden of Mame's
financial success on her shoulders,
Ms. Ball might have done more
with Mame by doing less with
Lucy.
