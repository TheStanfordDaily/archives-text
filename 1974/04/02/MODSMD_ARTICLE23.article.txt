# Jazz Virtuoso At Keystone
## Turrentine Displays Bold Sax Style 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - Jazz
saxophonist Stanley Turrentine's
quartet appeared at Keystone
Korner for a week-long
engagement beginning March 19.
Turrentine, who got his
musical start as a cellist and later a
vibist, is currently enjoying more
notoriety than ever, as one of the
best tenor saxophonists working.
Although he has been playing
and recording steadily for over 20
years, his popularity is now at its
peak, as a result of his recent LPs

Sugar, Cherry, Salt Song and Don't
Mess With Mr. T. all on CTI.
On Wednesday, March 20,
Turrentine included several
selections from these LPs, the
most impressive being from Don't
Mess With Mr. T\ a slow ballad
entitled "I Could Never Repay
Your Love," and the title song, a
brooding, almost church-like
number, written by Marvin Gaye.
While in Lowell Fulson's blues
band in the early 50s, at the age
of 17, Turrentine was very
impressed with the group's
pianist, Ray Charles. That
influence is still in evidence today,
in Turrentine's bending of notes
and gospel-type harmonies.
Many of Turrentine's tunes
employed changes in tempo and
mode, like "Gibraltor" (from Salt

Song) and"The Way You Look
Tonight."
By request, Turrentine played
the Latin-ish "Pieces of Dreams"
twice.
Turrentine was backed by
pianist John Miller, bassist Teruo
Nakamura, and drummer Eddie
Moore.
Miller's fast, choppy scales
were featured on "Dereck's
Dance," minus Turrentine.
Moore's exuberant drumming
added greatly to every number.
Not content with just keeping
time, Moore added different
touches to practically every bar,
succeeding in doing what a good
drummer should do — making the

other musicians sound better.
Nakamura seemed competent
enough, but was hampered by a
too loud amplifier and an
out-of-tune instrument.
As for "Mr. T," this jazz fan
can't remember when he has been
as impressed by any saxophonist.
Turrentine's bold style seems
simple enough; clear, full tone,
economy in notes, and, most
importantly, no bullshit.
Having recorded for many
years with Blue Note and CTI,
Turrentine has just recently signed
with the Berkeley-based
Fantasy-Prestige label. This will
hopefully mean that the Bay Area
will be hearing more of Stanley
Turrentine.

Mess With Mr. T\ a slow ballad
entitled "I Could Never Repay
Your Love," and the title song, a
brooding, almost church-like
number, written by Marvin Gaye.
While in Lowell Fulson's blues
band in the early 50s, at the age
of 17, Turrentine was very
impressed with the group's
pianist, Ray Charles. That
influence is still in evidence today,
in Turrentine's bending of notes
and gospel-type harmonies.
Many of Turrentine's tunes
employed changes in tempo and
mode, like "Gibraltor" (from Salt

Song) and"The Way You Look
Tonight."
By request, Turrentine played
the Latin-ish "Pieces of Dreams"
twice.
Turrentine was backed by
pianist John Miller, bassist Teruo
Nakamura, and drummer Eddie
Moore.
Miller's fast, choppy scales
were featured on "Dereck's
Dance," minus Turrentine.
Moore's exuberant drumming
added greatly to every number.
Not content with just keeping
time, Moore added different
touches to practically every bar,
succeeding in doing what a good
drummer should do — making the

other musicians sound better.
Nakamura seemed competent
enough, but was hampered by a
too loud amplifier and an
out-of-tune instrument.
As for "Mr. T," this jazz fan
can't remember when he has been
as impressed by any saxophonist.
Turrentine's bold style seems
simple enough; clear, full tone,
economy in notes, and, most
importantly, no bullshit.
Having recorded for many
years with Blue Note and CTI,
Turrentine has just recently signed
with the Berkeley-based
Fantasy-Prestige label. This will
hopefully mean that the Bay Area
will be hearing more of Stanley
Turrentine.
SAN FRANCISCO - Jazz
saxophonist Stanley Turrentine's
quartet appeared at Keystone
Korner for a week-long
engagement beginning March 19.
Turrentine, who got his
musical start as a cellist and later a
vibist, is currently enjoying more
notoriety than ever, as one of the
best tenor saxophonists working.
Although he has been playing
and recording steadily for over 20
years, his popularity is now at its
peak, as a result of his recent LPs

Sugar, Cherry, Salt Song and Don't
Mess With Mr. T. all on CTI.
On Wednesday, March 20,
Turrentine included several
selections from these LPs, the
most impressive being from Don't
Mess With Mr. T\ a slow ballad
entitled "I Could Never Repay
Your Love," and the title song, a
brooding, almost church-like
number, written by Marvin Gaye.
