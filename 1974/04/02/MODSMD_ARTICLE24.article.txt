# Boston Ballet Lacks Professionalism
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
The critic Walter Sorell once
said that every age gets the art it
deserves. If this is the case then,
judging by the Boston Ballet
Chamber Company's March 15
performance in Memorial
Auditorium, ours is in a sorry
state.
Lately the trend in many of
the lesser known dance
companies, like the Boston Ballet,
is apparently to encompass as
broad a range of choreographic
styles as possible. In the hopes of
pleasing every member of the
audience, companies run the
gamut from a token "avant-garde"
piece like "Speed Zone," to the
classic staples like Pepita's "Don
Quixote," with a mild romantic
ballet like "The Dolly Suite"
thrown in for good measure.
This kind of potpourri
performance is usually less than
satisfying; one is left with the
sense that neither the dancers nor
the audience have had time to
digest or even discover the
subtleties of each piece.
Superficial Opening
Friday night's opening ballet,
"The Dolly Suite" (1971),
provided a good example of this
kind of superficial approach to
movement. "The Dolly Suite" was
a pleasant but not exciting piece,
choreographed for the Boston
Ballet by John Taras, ballet
master and choreographer for the
New York City Ballet.
Taras approaches classical
choreography with a simplicity
and directness that demands
perfection on the part of the
dancers if it is to succeed.
Unfortunately the dancers were
not equal to the task. The spacing
and timing were sloppy, and the

speed and lightness of certain
passages was completely missing.
In some sections when the leg
work was clear and precise, the
arms were languid and the wrists
limp, giving an uneven and almost
careless overall effect.
Midway through the evening,
what had begun as simple
carelessness in "The Dolly Suite"
quickly escalated into full scale
blunders by the time "Baroque
Concerto" began. Choreographed
by Norman Walker, the former
artistic director of Israel's
Batsheva Dance Company,

"Baroque Concerto" was built
upon abstract modern movements
taken from the basic Graham
vocabulary.
Lost Pretense
Any pretense at unison
movement had by this point
vanished. The self-assured grins in
"The Dolly Suite" disappeared,
replaced instead by the frantic
glances of dancers struggling
desperately to pull together the
group movement sequences. At
last one dancer became so
exasperated with his futile efforts
to keep up with the others that he
was heard to mutter "shit!". And
by that time most of the audience
could not help but agree with
him.
At several points the dance
held promise of interesting spatial
arrangements; duets alternated

with lyric quartets giving a sense
of a complexity and richness
underlying the surface
movements. However the
potential of the piece was never
realized; it instead degenerated
into a comedy of errors.
The third dance was the
Grande Pas De Deux from Pepita's
"Don Quixote." This was
disappointingly danced by Edra
Toth and Woytek Lowski, two of
the Boston Ballet's most
acclaimed principals.
No Virtuosity
Pepita's pas de deux is

frequently used as a vehicle for
displaying the virtuosity and
brilliant technique of the ballerina
and her partner. Yet neither Toth
nor her partner Lowski were
capable of virtuosity Friday night.
Throughout the ballet Toth
seemed plagued with a chronic
inability to balance. The simple
clarity and elegance of line in
Pepita's choreography was
completely lost. What should have
been a climactic arabesque or a
series of dazzling turns became
instead a futile balancing act.
"Speed Zone," the final dance
of the evening, was created by the

Boston Ballet's resident
choreographer, Samuel Kurkjian,
to Kammermusik No. 1 by
Hindemith. Perhaps it was because
this was the only piece by their
resident choreographer, but the
company looked more reassured
and comfortable than they had all
evening.
Hackneyed Technique
The piece had a powerful
beginning, as a group of dancers
progressed along the downstage
diagonal with a series of staccato
runs. The side wings of the stage
were removed, revealing the
waiting dancers 'offstage.' This
technique is by now rather
hackneyed, and it has been done
elsewhere with much more
imagination and success.
Despite a good start,
somewhere around the middle of
the piece the dancers lost the
powerful expressive quality of
Hindemith's score. The movement
became frenzied and disjointed as
the dancers struggled vainly to
maintain some sort of relationship
with the music.
At a master class given earlier
in the week by Tony Catanzaro,
one of the company's male
principals, Catanzaro had
cautioned those taking the class
that one would never be able to
dance onstage if he did not work
to make the movement more than
just a superficial gesture. How
unfortunate that at Friday night's
performance the Boston Ballet
failed to heed their own advice.

by Norman Walker, the former
artistic director of Israel's
Batsheva Dance Company,

"Baroque Concerto" was built
upon abstract modern movements
taken from the basic Graham
vocabulary.
Lost Pretense
Any pretense at unison
movement had by this point
vanished. The self-assured grins in
"The Dolly Suite" disappeared,
replaced instead by the frantic
glances of dancers struggling
desperately to pull together the
group movement sequences. At
last one dancer became so
exasperated with his futile efforts
to keep up with the others that he
was heard to mutter "shit!". And
by that time most of the audience
could not help but agree with
him.
At several points the dance
held promise of interesting spatial
arrangements; duets alternated

with lyric quartets giving a sense
of a complexity and richness
underlying the surface
movements. However the
potential of the piece was never
realized; it instead degenerated
into a comedy of errors.
The third dance was the
Grande Pas De Deux from Pepita's
"Don Quixote." This was
disappointingly danced by Edra
Toth and Woytek Lowski, two of
the Boston Ballet's most
acclaimed principals.
No Virtuosity
Pepita's pas de deux is

frequently used as a vehicle for
displaying the virtuosity and
brilliant technique of the ballerina
and her partner. Yet neither Toth
nor her partner Lowski were
capable of virtuosity Friday night.
Throughout the ballet Toth
seemed plagued with a chronic
inability to balance. The simple
clarity and elegance of line in
Pepita's choreography was
completely lost. What should have
been a climactic arabesque or a
series of dazzling turns became
instead a futile balancing act.
"Speed Zone," the final dance
of the evening, was created by the

Boston Ballet's resident
choreographer, Samuel Kurkjian,
to Kammermusik No. 1 by
Hindemith. Perhaps it was because
this was the only piece by their
resident choreographer, but the
company looked more reassured
and comfortable than they had all
evening.
Hackneyed Technique
The piece had a powerful
beginning, as a group of dancers
progressed along the downstage
diagonal with a series of staccato
runs. The side wings of the stage
were removed, revealing the
waiting dancers 'offstage.' This
technique is by now rather
hackneyed, and it has been done
elsewhere with much more
imagination and success.
Despite a good start,
somewhere around the middle of
the piece the dancers lost the
powerful expressive quality of
Hindemith's score. The movement
became frenzied and disjointed as
the dancers struggled vainly to
maintain some sort of relationship
with the music.
At a master class given earlier
in the week by Tony Catanzaro,
one of the company's male
principals, Catanzaro had
cautioned those taking the class
that one would never be able to
dance onstage if he did not work
to make the movement more than
just a superficial gesture. How
unfortunate that at Friday night's
performance the Boston Ballet
failed to heed their own advice.

Entertainment
The critic Walter Sorell once
said that every age gets the art it
deserves. If this is the case then,
judging by the Boston Ballet
Chamber Company's March 15
performance in Memorial
Auditorium, ours is in a sorry
state.
Lately the trend in many of
the lesser known dance
companies, like the Boston Ballet,
is apparently to encompass as
broad a range of choreographic
styles as possible. In the hopes of
pleasing every member of the
audience, companies run the
gamut from a token "avant-garde"
piece like "Speed Zone," to the
classic staples like Pepita's "Don
Quixote," with a mild romantic
ballet like "The Dolly Suite"
thrown in for good measure.
This kind of potpourri
performance is usually less than
satisfying; one is left with the
sense that neither the dancers nor
the audience have had time to
digest or even discover the
subtleties of each piece.
Superficial Opening
Friday night's opening ballet,
"The Dolly Suite" (1971),
provided a good example of this
kind of superficial approach to
movement. "The Dolly Suite" was
a pleasant but not exciting piece,
choreographed for the Boston
Ballet by John Taras, ballet
master and choreographer for the
New York City Ballet.
Taras approaches classical
choreography with a simplicity
and directness that demands
perfection on the part of the
dancers if it is to succeed.
Unfortunately the dancers were
not equal to the task. The spacing
and timing were sloppy, and the

speed and lightness of certain
passages was completely missing.
In some sections when the leg
work was clear and precise, the
arms were languid and the wrists
limp, giving an uneven and almost
careless overall effect.
Midway through the evening,
what had begun as simple
carelessness in "The Dolly Suite"
quickly escalated into full scale
blunders by the time "Baroque
Concerto" began. Choreographed

artistic director of Israel's

this was the only piece by their
resident choreographer, but the
company looked more reassured
and comfortable than they had all
evening.
Hackneyed Technique
The piece had a powerful
beginning, as a group of dancers
progressed along the downstage
diagonal with a series of staccato
runs. The side wings of the stage
were removed, revealing the
waiting dancers 'offstage.' This
technique is by now rather
hackneyed, and it has been done
elsewhere with much more
imagination and success.
Despite a good start,
somewhere around the middle of
the piece the dancers lost the
powerful expressive quality of
Hindemith's score. The movement
became frenzied and disjointed as
the dancers struggled vainly to
maintain some sort of relationship
with the music.
At a master class given earlier
in the week by Tony Catanzaro,
one of the company's male
principals, Catanzaro had
cautioned those taking the class
that one would never be able to
dance onstage if he did not work
to make the movement more than
just a superficial gesture. How
unfortunate that at Friday night's
performance the Boston Ballet
failed to heed their own advice.

The critic Walter Sorell once
said that every age gets the art it
deserves. If this is the case then,
judging by the Boston Ballet
Chamber Company's March 15
performance in Memorial
Auditorium, ours is in a sorry
state.
Lately the trend in many of
the lesser known dance
companies, like the Boston Ballet,
is apparently to encompass as
broad a range of choreographic
styles as possible. In the hopes of
pleasing every member of the
audience, companies run the
gamut from a token "avant-garde"
piece like "Speed Zone," to the
classic staples like Pepita's "Don
Quixote," with a mild romantic
ballet like "The Dolly Suite"
thrown in for good measure.
This kind of potpourri
performance is usually less than
satisfying; one is left with the
sense that neither the dancers nor
the audience have had time to
digest or even discover the
subtleties of each piece.
Superficial Opening
Friday night's opening ballet,
"The Dolly Suite" (1971),
provided a good example of this
kind of superficial approach to
movement. "The Dolly Suite" was
a pleasant but not exciting piece,
choreographed for the Boston
Ballet by John Taras, ballet
master and choreographer for the
New York City Ballet.
Taras approaches classical
choreography with a simplicity
and directness that demands
perfection on the part of the
dancers if it is to succeed.
Unfortunately the dancers were
not equal to the task. The spacing
and timing were sloppy, and the

speed and lightness of certain
passages was completely missing.
In some sections when the leg
work was clear and precise, the
arms were languid and the wrists
limp, giving an uneven and almost
careless overall effect.
Midway through the evening,
what had begun as simple
carelessness in "The Dolly Suite"
quickly escalated into full scale
blunders by the time "Baroque
Concerto" began. Choreographed
by Norman Walker, the former
artistic director of Israel's
Batsheva Dance Company,

"Baroque Concerto" was built
upon abstract modern movements
taken from the basic Graham
vocabulary.
Lost Pretense
Any pretense at unison
movement had by this point
vanished. The self-assured grins in
"The Dolly Suite" disappeared,
replaced instead by the frantic
glances of dancers struggling
desperately to pull together the
group movement sequences. At
last one dancer became so
exasperated with his futile efforts
to keep up with the others that he
was heard to mutter "shit!". And
by that time most of the audience
could not help but agree with
him.
At several points the dance
held promise of interesting spatial
arrangements; duets alternated

with lyric quartets giving a sense
of a complexity and richness
underlying the surface
movements. However the
potential of the piece was never
realized; it instead degenerated
into a comedy of errors.
The third dance was the
Grande Pas De Deux from Pepita's
"Don Quixote." This was
disappointingly danced by Edra
Toth and Woytek Lowski, two of
the Boston Ballet's most
acclaimed principals.
No Virtuosity
Pepita's pas de deux is

frequently used as a vehicle for
displaying the virtuosity and
brilliant technique of the ballerina
and her partner. Yet neither Toth
nor her partner Lowski were
capable of virtuosity Friday night.
Throughout the ballet Toth
seemed plagued with a chronic
inability to balance. The simple
clarity and elegance of line in
Pepita's choreography was
completely lost. What should have
been a climactic arabesque or a
series of dazzling turns became
instead a futile balancing act.
"Speed Zone," the final dance
of the evening, was created by the

Boston Ballet's resident
choreographer, Samuel Kurkjian,
to Kammermusik No. 1 by
Hindemith. Perhaps it was because
this was the only piece by their
resident choreographer, but the
company looked more reassured
and comfortable than they had all
evening.
