# Mose Has Much To Say

### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - Mose
Allison, one of the most
influential pianist-vocalists in
modern jazz, appeared at El
Matador for two weeks, beginning
March 12.
When Mose first hit the New
York bebop scene in the mid-50s,
from Mississippi, his major
influences ranged from the vocal
style of Sonny Boy Williamson to
the highly rhythmic piano work
of Erroll Garner.
During this time, Mose was
primarily an instrumentalist,
playing with people like Stan
Getz and Gerry Muligan, until
forming his own trio, when he
introduced his trumpet playing
and his voice.
Soon his voice dominated, with
the trumpet being left out
completely, and his instrumental
nurfibers becoming less and less
frequent.
It was Mose's cynical,
sometimes biting, lyrics, sung in
his characteristic down-home,
highly syncopated style that really
turned people's heads.
Saturday, March 16, after a
medley of three instrumental,
Mose broke quickly into "Jus'
Like Livin' " which serves to more
or less set the tone for any Mose
Allison performances.
"I've been doin' some thin kin 1
I Bout the future of the human
race.
If people don't stop killin' people,
It's gonna be a hopeless case."
Mose's percussive piano style is

largely built around very fast
scales and a lot of wide open
chords, often octaves, sometimes
opposing octaves. The overall
effect is, in a word, overwhelming.
Dissonance was used to great
effect in Mose's piano solos, as
well as his singing, which is loaded
with "blue notes."
His beautiful, super-slow
version of "You Are My
Sunshine" displayed how Mose
uses his voice like an instrument â€”
hard accents, slurs, fades, tempo
variations.
On "Do Nothing 'Til You Hear
From Me," written by Duke
Ellington, it was apparent that
Mose was adhearing to the melody
more than he normally would on
his own compositions.
Mose has a great knack for
choosing material from other
sources that fits in with his own
repertoire.
Perhaps the best example of
this is Nat Cole's "Meet Me At No
Special Place (And I'll Be There
At No Particular Time):"
"/'m all fed up on your advice.
Missing you will be paradise."
While on stage, Mose is
seemingly oblivious to his
audience, but in reality he is quite
concerned with the images that
reach his listeners.
"When I play a set, it's an
attempt to convey my whole
musical thing, in that set, or at
least to give a pretty good idea of
the scope of it."
Complying with requests from
the audience, Mose sang several of

his early hits, including
"Parchman Farm," from 1958,
which is one of the best insights
into prison life ever written.
"/'m gonna be here for the rest of
my life,
And all I did was shoot my wife."
The other two thirds of Mose's
trio consists of Lee Charlton
(drums) and Jack Hannah (bass).
Neither were exceptional
soloists, but both handled the
ominous task of following Mose's
constantly changing
improvisations quite well.
Mose is one jazzman who
definitely has a lot to say. One of
his more biting compositions is
"Everybody Cryin'Mercy:"
"People runnin' 'round in circles
Don't know what they're headed
for.
Everybody cryin' 'Peace on earth,
Just as soon as we win this war.' "
His messages are always clear; his
point is always made.
