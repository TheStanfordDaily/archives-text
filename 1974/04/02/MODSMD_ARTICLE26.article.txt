Russia Ships Gasoline To UJS.
NEW YORK — The Russians were shipping quantities of
their own petroleum products to the United States at the
same time they were publicly encouraging the Arab oil
boycott against this country.
U.S. Customs records here show that since the first of
the year, four tankers have docked in New York and New
Jersey ports carrying Sovet petroleum supplies, including
millions of gallons of gasoline.
In Washington, federal officials said yesterday they were
not surprised to learn of the Russian imports. One State
Department official said the imports began long before the
Arab boycott and there never was any indication the Soviet
Union intended to join the Arab action.
"In fact," the State Department official said, "I dorf t
think the Arabs ever asked the other OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) members to join the
boycott."
In the case of some of the imports, he added, "the same
ships that took over our wheat brought back their oil."
U.N. Observers Kidnaped In Israel
JERUSALEM — Fighting raged on the Golan Heights
front for the 21st straight day yesterday and the Israeli
radio said Syrian army units had kidnaped two United
Nations observers, apparently mistaking them for Israeli
soldiers.
It said the two were abducted from their outposts
between Israeli and Syrian forces late Friday and were in a
Damascus hospital last night.
The radio said the observers were led back to Syrian
lines barefoot before the mistake was discovered.
The observers are stationed between Syrian and Israeli
forces on the 40-mile front to report violations of the truce.
The observers include American and Soviet contingents.
Killer Says Boyle Gave Orders
MEDIA — One of the gunmen convicted of killing
United Mine Workers (UMW) insurgent Joseph "Jock"
Yablonski testified yesterday he had been told the
assassination orders came from W.A. "Tony" Boyle.
Boyle, the 72-vear-old former UMW president, is on trial
charged with plotting the murders of Yablonski, his wife
and their daughter at their Clarksville, Pa., home on Dec.
31, 1969.
In opening arguments, special prosecutor Richard
Sprague said Boyle "plotted and paid for the murders" with
$20,000 appropriated from union funds.
Chief defense lawyer Charles T. Moses said: "The
ultimate issue is simply whether Mr. Boyle was responsible
for these deaths. The answer is no."
Paul Gilly, 40, a Cleveland house painter, testified for
the prosecution, saying he had been hired to commit the
murders bv his father-in-law, Silous Huddleston, a former
UMW official.
"Did he mention who had given him the orders?"
Sprague asked.

Gilly replied: "He mentioned Mr. Prater's name. He
mentioned Mr. Pasi> s name. He mentioned Mr. Boyle's
name."
Jury Chosen For Chapin Trial
WASHINGTON — A jury of seven men and five women
was chosen yesterday to try Dwight L. Chapin, President
Nixon's former appointments secretary, on four charges
that he lied under oath to a grand jury.
Four of the women and one of the men on the jury are
white. The rest are black.
Chapin's lawyers argued in pretrial motions that a
predominantly black jury might be prejudiced against their
client. The judge rejected their motion to move the case
elsewhere.
The jury was selected in less than four hours, and the
judge said the taking of testimony would begin this
morning.
He disclosed that Chapin's attorney several days ago
filed a motion objecting to certain "dirty tricks"
documents being presented at the trial. He said he would
not rule on the point immediately.
Chapin is accused of making false statements about the
political activities of Donald H. Segretti in the 1972 Florida
primary. The four counts against Chapin carry maximum
penalties of five years in prison and $10,000 each.
He is the first staff member of Nixon's inner circle at the
White House to go on trial. Two former Cabinet members,
John N. Mitchell and Maurice Stans, are currently being
tried by a federal jury in New York in a campaign
contributions case.
Patty Hearst's Sisters Write
HILLSBOROUGH — Two sisters of kidnaped newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst are writing her letters in response to
a request she made for more news from her family, the
Hearsts announced yesterday.
Their father's newspaper, The San Francisco Examiner,
will publish a letter from 17-year-old Victoria today and
one from 18-year-old Ann on Wednesday, said family
spokesman John Lester.
He quoted the girls' father, Randolph A. Hearst, as
saying: "I didn't want to attract attention to the other
children and I didn't want to put them on television." But
he said Hearst thought the letters were a good idea.
The Hearsts have spoken to their daughter through the
news media several times, and she asked in a tape
communication March 9 to hear from others in the family
as well.
Hearst is expected to complete selection shortly of
trustees for a $4 million Hearst Corp. trust fund to provide
food for the poor after Patricia's safe release.
Today's Weather

not surprised to learn of the Russian imports. One State
Department official said the imports began long before the
Arab boycott and there never was any indication the Soviet
Union intended to join the Arab action.
"In fact," the State Department official said, "I dorf t
think the Arabs ever asked the other OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) members to join the
boycott."
In the case of some of the imports, he added, "the same
ships that took over our wheat brought back their oil."
U.N. Observers Kidnaped In Israel
JERUSALEM — Fighting raged on the Golan Heights
front for the 21st straight day yesterday and the Israeli
radio said Syrian army units had kidnaped two United
Nations observers, apparently mistaking them for Israeli
soldiers.
It said the two were abducted from their outposts
between Israeli and Syrian forces late Friday and were in a
Damascus hospital last night.
The radio said the observers were led back to Syrian
lines barefoot before the mistake was discovered.
The observers are stationed between Syrian and Israeli
forces on the 40-mile front to report violations of the truce.
The observers include American and Soviet contingents.
Killer Says Boyle Gave Orders
MEDIA — One of the gunmen convicted of killing
United Mine Workers (UMW) insurgent Joseph "Jock"
Yablonski testified yesterday he had been told the
assassination orders came from W.A. "Tony" Boyle.
Boyle, the 72-vear-old former UMW president, is on trial
charged with plotting the murders of Yablonski, his wife
and their daughter at their Clarksville, Pa., home on Dec.
31, 1969.
In opening arguments, special prosecutor Richard
Sprague said Boyle "plotted and paid for the murders" with
$20,000 appropriated from union funds.
Chief defense lawyer Charles T. Moses said: "The
ultimate issue is simply whether Mr. Boyle was responsible
for these deaths. The answer is no."
Paul Gilly, 40, a Cleveland house painter, testified for
the prosecution, saying he had been hired to commit the
murders bv his father-in-law, Silous Huddleston, a former
UMW official.
"Did he mention who had given him the orders?"
Sprague asked.

Gilly replied: "He mentioned Mr. Prater's name. He
mentioned Mr. Pasi> s name. He mentioned Mr. Boyle's
name."
Jury Chosen For Chapin Trial
WASHINGTON — A jury of seven men and five women
was chosen yesterday to try Dwight L. Chapin, President
Nixon's former appointments secretary, on four charges
that he lied under oath to a grand jury.
Four of the women and one of the men on the jury are
white. The rest are black.
Chapin's lawyers argued in pretrial motions that a
predominantly black jury might be prejudiced against their
client. The judge rejected their motion to move the case
elsewhere.
The jury was selected in less than four hours, and the
judge said the taking of testimony would begin this
morning.
He disclosed that Chapin's attorney several days ago
filed a motion objecting to certain "dirty tricks"
documents being presented at the trial. He said he would
not rule on the point immediately.
Chapin is accused of making false statements about the
political activities of Donald H. Segretti in the 1972 Florida
primary. The four counts against Chapin carry maximum
penalties of five years in prison and $10,000 each.
He is the first staff member of Nixon's inner circle at the
White House to go on trial. Two former Cabinet members,
John N. Mitchell and Maurice Stans, are currently being
tried by a federal jury in New York in a campaign
contributions case.
Patty Hearst's Sisters Write
HILLSBOROUGH — Two sisters of kidnaped newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst are writing her letters in response to
a request she made for more news from her family, the
Hearsts announced yesterday.
Their father's newspaper, The San Francisco Examiner,
will publish a letter from 17-year-old Victoria today and
one from 18-year-old Ann on Wednesday, said family
spokesman John Lester.
He quoted the girls' father, Randolph A. Hearst, as
saying: "I didn't want to attract attention to the other
children and I didn't want to put them on television." But
he said Hearst thought the letters were a good idea.
The Hearsts have spoken to their daughter through the
news media several times, and she asked in a tape
communication March 9 to hear from others in the family
as well.
Hearst is expected to complete selection shortly of
trustees for a $4 million Hearst Corp. trust fund to provide
food for the poor after Patricia's safe release.

ships that took over our wheat brought back their oil."
U.N. Observers Kidnaped In Israel
JERUSALEM — Fighting raged on the Golan Heights
front for the 21st straight day yesterday and the Israeli
radio said Syrian army units had kidnaped two United
Nations observers, apparently mistaking them for Israeli
soldiers.
It said the two were abducted from their outposts
between Israeli and Syrian forces late Friday and were in a
Damascus hospital last night.
The radio said the observers were led back to Syrian
lines barefoot before the mistake was discovered.
The observers are stationed between Syrian and Israeli
forces on the 40-mile front to report violations of the truce.
The observers include American and Soviet contingents.
Killer Says Boyle Gave Orders
MEDIA — One of the gunmen convicted of killing
United Mine Workers (UMW) insurgent Joseph "Jock"
Yablonski testified yesterday he had been told the
assassination orders came from W.A. "Tony" Boyle.
Boyle, the 72-vear-old former UMW president, is on trial
charged with plotting the murders of Yablonski, his wife
and their daughter at their Clarksville, Pa., home on Dec.
31, 1969.
In opening arguments, special prosecutor Richard
Sprague said Boyle "plotted and paid for the murders" with
$20,000 appropriated from union funds.
Chief defense lawyer Charles T. Moses said: "The
ultimate issue is simply whether Mr. Boyle was responsible
for these deaths. The answer is no."
Paul Gilly, 40, a Cleveland house painter, testified for
the prosecution, saying he had been hired to commit the
murders bv his father-in-law, Silous Huddleston, a former
UMW official.
"Did he mention who had given him the orders?"
Sprague asked.

Gilly replied: "He mentioned Mr. Prater's name. He
mentioned Mr. Pasi> s name. He mentioned Mr. Boyle's
name."
Jury Chosen For Chapin Trial
WASHINGTON — A jury of seven men and five women
was chosen yesterday to try Dwight L. Chapin, President
Nixon's former appointments secretary, on four charges
that he lied under oath to a grand jury.
Four of the women and one of the men on the jury are
white. The rest are black.
Chapin's lawyers argued in pretrial motions that a
predominantly black jury might be prejudiced against their
client. The judge rejected their motion to move the case
elsewhere.
The jury was selected in less than four hours, and the
judge said the taking of testimony would begin this
morning.
He disclosed that Chapin's attorney several days ago
filed a motion objecting to certain "dirty tricks"
documents being presented at the trial. He said he would
not rule on the point immediately.
Chapin is accused of making false statements about the
political activities of Donald H. Segretti in the 1972 Florida
primary. The four counts against Chapin carry maximum
penalties of five years in prison and $10,000 each.
He is the first staff member of Nixon's inner circle at the
White House to go on trial. Two former Cabinet members,
John N. Mitchell and Maurice Stans, are currently being
tried by a federal jury in New York in a campaign
contributions case.
Patty Hearst's Sisters Write
HILLSBOROUGH — Two sisters of kidnaped newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst are writing her letters in response to
a request she made for more news from her family, the
Hearsts announced yesterday.
Their father's newspaper, The San Francisco Examiner,
will publish a letter from 17-year-old Victoria today and
one from 18-year-old Ann on Wednesday, said family
spokesman John Lester.
He quoted the girls' father, Randolph A. Hearst, as
saying: "I didn't want to attract attention to the other
children and I didn't want to put them on television." But
he said Hearst thought the letters were a good idea.
The Hearsts have spoken to their daughter through the
news media several times, and she asked in a tape
communication March 9 to hear from others in the family
as well.
Hearst is expected to complete selection shortly of
trustees for a $4 million Hearst Corp. trust fund to provide
food for the poor after Patricia's safe release.

Russia Ships Gasoline To UJS.
NEW YORK — The Russians were shipping quantities of
their own petroleum products to the United States at the
same time they were publicly encouraging the Arab oil
boycott against this country.
U.S. Customs records here show that since the first of
the year, four tankers have docked in New York and New
Jersey ports carrying Sovet petroleum supplies, including
millions of gallons of gasoline.
In Washington, federal officials said yesterday they were
not surprised to learn of the Russian imports. One State
Department official said the imports began long before the
Arab boycott and there never was any indication the Soviet
Union intended to join the Arab action.
"In fact," the State Department official said, "I dorf t
think the Arabs ever asked the other OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) members to join the
boycott."
In the case of some of the imports, he added, "the same
ships that took over our wheat brought back their oil."
