# Arnett Proposes Death Definition
## 
### 
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R-Redwood City, yesterday
introduced legislation permitting
doctors to pronounce a person dead
when his brain stops functioning, even
if his heart continues beating.
The bill, AB 3560, is aimed at
removing the legal cloud over heart,
kidney and eye transplants, which has
apparently deterred doctors from
performing the operations.
The legislation does not define
brain death, but instead amends the
California Anatomical Gift Act by
stating: "A person may be pronounced
dead if, based on usual and customary
standards of medical practice, it is
determined that the person has
suffered an irreversible cessation of
brain function."
Currently, the California state code
concerning transplants says that a
physician must declare a potential
donor dead, but the code does not
establish the criteria to be used.
Arnett said that statistics his staff
collected showed that the number of
transplants is dropping off. "There
were 400 people in California last year
that needed kidney transplants and
didn't get them."
He added that the only reason to
try to expand the legal definition of
Defective Fireplace
Caused Lounge Fire
A fire which resulted in $1500
damage to Junipero lounge March 25
was apparently caused by a defective
fireplace which did not meet fire code
standards, Stanford Fire Chief Frank
Jurian said yesterday.
The fire, which moved from the
fireplace to a wooden mantle above it
and then burned an interior wall,
probably spread because not enough
grout separated the wooden mantle
from the fire, Jurian said.
The fireplace had been
reconstructed after a fire attributed to
arson destroyed the Junipero lounge
on April 26, 1971. "It appears that the
brick mason did not do a proper job of
rebuilding," Student Housing Manager
Alan Cummings observed.
A University inspector will insure
that a new fireplace presently under
construction in the lounge will meet
fire code specifications, Jurian said.

death was to save lives by removing
the threat of law suits stemming from
transplants.
Chuck Cavalier, Arnett's
administrative assistant, earlier had
said that two court cases prompted the
research that led to the bill.
Both cases involve Stanford heart
surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway, who
performed heart transplants after the
donors had been pronounced dead,
using brain-death criteria.
In the Santa Rosa case, Municipal
Court Judge John Passalacqua
originally dismissed manslaughter
charges against Frank Flores, driver of
a car in which Colenda Ward was one

of ten persons injured in an accident.
However, Sonoma County Superior
Court Judge Kenneth Eymann ruled
that Flores must stand trial on
manslaughter charges.
In an earlier Oakland case, Andrew
Lyons is charged in the murder of
Samuel M. Moore. John Cruikshank,
Lyons' attorney, has argued that
Moore's heart was beating when the
transplant was performed and
therefore was killed by the operation,
not the bullet. However, Oakland
Municipal Court Judge Stafford
Buckley ruled that Lyons must stand
trial for murder.

using brain-death criteria.
In the Santa Rosa case, Municipal
Court Judge John Passalacqua
originally dismissed manslaughter
charges against Frank Flores, driver of
a car in which Colenda Ward was one

of ten persons injured in an accident.
However, Sonoma County Superior
Court Judge Kenneth Eymann ruled
that Flores must stand trial on
manslaughter charges.
In an earlier Oakland case, Andrew
Lyons is charged in the murder of
Samuel M. Moore. John Cruikshank,
Lyons' attorney, has argued that
Moore's heart was beating when the
transplant was performed and
therefore was killed by the operation,
not the bullet. However, Oakland
Municipal Court Judge Stafford
Buckley ruled that Lyons must stand
trial for murder.
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R-Redwood City, yesterday
introduced legislation permitting
doctors to pronounce a person dead
when his brain stops functioning, even
if his heart continues beating.
The bill, AB 3560, is aimed at
removing the legal cloud over heart,
kidney and eye transplants, which has
apparently deterred doctors from
performing the operations.
The legislation does not define
brain death, but instead amends the
California Anatomical Gift Act by
stating: "A person may be pronounced
dead if, based on usual and customary
standards of medical practice, it is
determined that the person has
suffered an irreversible cessation of
brain function."
Currently, the California state code
concerning transplants says that a
physician must declare a potential
donor dead, but the code does not
establish the criteria to be used.
Arnett said that statistics his staff
collected showed that the number of
transplants is dropping off. "There
were 400 people in California last year
that needed kidney transplants and
didn't get them."
He added that the only reason to
try to expand the legal definition of
Defective Fireplace
Caused Lounge Fire
A fire which resulted in $1500
damage to Junipero lounge March 25
was apparently caused by a defective
fireplace which did not meet fire code
standards, Stanford Fire Chief Frank
Jurian said yesterday.
The fire, which moved from the
fireplace to a wooden mantle above it
and then burned an interior wall,
probably spread because not enough
grout separated the wooden mantle
from the fire, Jurian said.
The fireplace had been
reconstructed after a fire attributed to
arson destroyed the Junipero lounge
on April 26, 1971. "It appears that the
brick mason did not do a proper job of
rebuilding," Student Housing Manager
Alan Cummings observed.
A University inspector will insure
that a new fireplace presently under
construction in the lounge will meet
fire code specifications, Jurian said.

death was to save lives by removing
the threat of law suits stemming from
transplants.
Chuck Cavalier, Arnett's
administrative assistant, earlier had
said that two court cases prompted the
research that led to the bill.
Both cases involve Stanford heart
surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway, who
performed heart transplants after the
donors had been pronounced dead,
using brain-death criteria.
