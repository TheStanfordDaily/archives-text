# De Young Leads Energy Conservation Drive
## 
### TERRY ANZUP First of Three Parts 
Move over, William Simon.
After Plant Services Director Dan
DeYoung appeared on KZSU's
Campus Conference last Nov. 6 to
announce the beginning of a concerted
effort to cut back campus energy use,
his secretary pasted a bright orange
star on his office door and jokingly
referred to him as Stanford's own
"energy czar."
If DeYoung is a target for the
good-natured kidding of Plant Services
employees, it's because his increasingly
visible role as an energy conservation
policy-maker has also made him a
campus newsmaker. But he doesn't
mind. In fact, he welcomes the
publicity.
"To get community support for
energy conservation, you've got to
have public relations," he admits.
But Stanford's energy czar doesn't
rely on campus media coverage alone
to communicate with consumers. He
has launched a publicity effort of his
own.
Reminders Posted
Fluorescent orange stickers
plastered on exit doors, light switches,
electrical equipment, and maintenance
vehicle bumpers remind potential
energy-wasters all over the campus to
"Kill a Watt," or "Off it—and Save
Energy." An "Energy Bulletin" keeps
energy-savers informed of the progress
of their conservation efforts.
Other conservation campaign
measures are "just for fun," DeYoung
acknowledges. One flashy sticker asks
students to "shower in the dark and
save energy." Candlelight dinners in

student residences are a popular fringe
benefit of the effort to trim energy
use.
Although the student who spends
ten minutes in the shower stall
without turning on the 60-watt
overhead lightbulb may feel that he is
an integral part of Stanford's attempts
to squeeze by the energy crunch, his
individual contribution to measurable
energy savings is negligible. By "offing
it"he saves .01 kilowatt-hour (kwhr)
of electrical energy, which would have
slashed a mere .0135 cents from the

University's $82,000 Pacific Gas and
Electric (PG&E) bill for February.
(One kwhr of electrical energy, the
amount used by an average electric
toaster for one hour of continuous
operation, costs the University 1.35
cents.)
Saving Energy, Not Money
Similarly, if the residents of one
row house ate dinner by candlelight
every night for one month, they would
conserve approximately 27 kwhr (36.5
cents-worth) of electricity by burning
seven of the 1200 candles of

University Food Service purchased in a
recent "conservation" move that saved
energy, but not dollars.
DeYoung doesn't mind that the
cost of a particular energy
consciousness-raising program
sometimes overbalances its measurable
contribution to the University-wide
energy use cutback effort.
"The important thing about the
public relations program is that it is
raising people's tolerance for reduction
of energy," he contends.
Because pre-energy shortage
lifestyles have habituated the average
energy consumer to use more heat or
lighting than he or she needs, some
find it difficult to trim energy use
back to essentials. Although the most
organized opposition to energy
conservation moves came from
unmarried residents of Escondido
Village who threatened the University
with a lawsuit when they were asked
to leave their apartments during the
Dec. 15-Jan. 4 University housing
shutdown, others have circumvented
energy-saving efforts by wasting even
more energy.
Secretary Adds Heater
Chilled by a temperature reduction
in the plant services building and
unwarmed by the knowledge that each
degree of reduction cut energy
consumption for the area by 1.5
percent, DeYoung's secretary recently
obtained a portable electric heater for
her desk area. DeYoung, noting that
the unit used three times as much
fossil fuel to generate electric heat as it
takes to produce an equivalent amount

plant, advised her to unplug the
energy-eater and put on a sweater.
The campus energy czar's secretary
isn't the only one who was skeptical of
reducing room temperatures to a
Nixonian 68 degrees. But individual
sacrifices eventually add up to
significant savings.
DeYoung estimates that conscious
consumer action has accounted for
more than one-fifth of the 20 percent
reduction in overall energy use levels
here since Nov. 1. Compared to the
same Nov.-Feb. period in 1972-73,
Plant Services has cut electrical energy
use by 6.5 million kwhr and heating
fuel consumption by 2.5 million
therms, for a savings of $167,000 in
utility costs.
Some Advantages
Since November, many have
discovered what DeYoung calls, "the
health and educational advantages of
less heating." Professors claim that
students are less lethargic when
classrooms are less overheated.
DeYoung has received dozens of
letters in response to the energy
cutback campaign and only two
writers disapproved, he says.
Although few students have
curtailed dead week all-nighters or
developed an appreciation for cold
showers, few campus energy
conservers have experienced more than
a 'ftiild level of discomfort," DeYoung
claims.
Each weekend, heat is shut off in
all unused academic buildings,

including Memorial Auditorium. But
the throngs at the ASSU Flicks don't
report a marked temperature
difference on Sunday night, although
DeYoung frequently supplies the flicks
with "just enough heat to take the
chill off' after a weekend without
heating.
For the individual conserver, saving
energy means turning off unneeded
lights, reducing heat levels, keeping
doors and windows closed to minimize
heat or air conditioning losses, and
halting or reducing use of unnecessary
electrical equipment. "Cutbacks at the
individual level are the first step in the
recognition of the problem," DeYoung
says.

Electric (PG&E) bill for February.
(One kwhr of electrical energy, the
amount used by an average electric
toaster for one hour of continuous
operation, costs the University 1.35

Saving Energy, Not Money

every night for one month, they would

of energy," he contends.

lifestyles have habituated the average
energy consumer to use more heat or

plant, advised her to unplug the
energy-eater and put on a sweater.
The campus energy czar's secretary
isn't the only one who was skeptical of
reducing room temperatures to a
Nixonian 68 degrees. But individual
sacrifices eventually add up to
significant savings.
DeYoung estimates that conscious
consumer action has accounted for
more than one-fifth of the 20 percent
reduction in overall energy use levels
here since Nov. 1. Compared to the
same Nov.-Feb. period in 1972-73,
Plant Services has cut electrical energy
use by 6.5 million kwhr and heating
fuel consumption by 2.5 million
therms, for a savings of $167,000 in
utility costs.
Some Advantages
Since November, many have
discovered what DeYoung calls, "the
health and educational advantages of
less heating." Professors claim that
students are less lethargic when
classrooms are less overheated.
DeYoung has received dozens of
letters in response to the energy
cutback campaign and only two
writers disapproved, he says.
Although few students have
curtailed dead week all-nighters or
developed an appreciation for cold
showers, few campus energy
conservers have experienced more than
a 'ftiild level of discomfort," DeYoung
claims.
Each weekend, heat is shut off in
all unused academic buildings,

including Memorial Auditorium. But
the throngs at the ASSU Flicks don't
report a marked temperature
difference on Sunday night, although
DeYoung frequently supplies the flicks
with "just enough heat to take the
chill off' after a weekend without
heating.
For the individual conserver, saving
energy means turning off unneeded
lights, reducing heat levels, keeping
doors and windows closed to minimize
heat or air conditioning losses, and
halting or reducing use of unnecessary
electrical equipment. "Cutbacks at the
individual level are the first step in the
recognition of the problem," DeYoung
says.
Move over, William Simon.
After Plant Services Director Dan
DeYoung appeared on KZSU's
Campus Conference last Nov. 6 to
announce the beginning of a concerted
effort to cut back campus energy use,
his secretary pasted a bright orange
star on his office door and jokingly
referred to him as Stanford's own
"energy czar."
If DeYoung is a target for the
good-natured kidding of Plant Services
employees, it's because his increasingly
visible role as an energy conservation
policy-maker has also made him a
campus newsmaker. But he doesn't
mind. In fact, he welcomes the
publicity.
"To get community support for
energy conservation, you've got to
have public relations," he admits.

rely on campus media coverage alone
to communicate with consumers. He
has launched a publicity effort of his

support for reduction of energy use.
plant, advised her to unplug the
energy-eater and put on a sweater.
The campus energy czar's secretary
isn't the only one who was skeptical of
reducing room temperatures to a
Nixonian 68 degrees. But individual
sacrifices eventually add up to
significant savings.
DeYoung estimates that conscious
consumer action has accounted for
more than one-fifth of the 20 percent
reduction in overall energy use levels
here since Nov. 1. Compared to the
same Nov.-Feb. period in 1972-73,
Plant Services has cut electrical energy
use by 6.5 million kwhr and heating
fuel consumption by 2.5 million
therms, for a savings of $167,000 in
utility costs.
Some Advantages
Since November, many have
discovered what DeYoung calls, "the
health and educational advantages of
less heating." Professors claim that
students are less lethargic when
classrooms are less overheated.
DeYoung has received dozens of
letters in response to the energy
cutback campaign and only two
writers disapproved, he says.
Although few students have
curtailed dead week all-nighters or
developed an appreciation for cold
showers, few campus energy
conservers have experienced more than
a 'ftiild level of discomfort," DeYoung
claims.
Each weekend, heat is shut off in
all unused academic buildings,

including Memorial Auditorium. But
the throngs at the ASSU Flicks don't
report a marked temperature
difference on Sunday night, although
DeYoung frequently supplies the flicks
with "just enough heat to take the
chill off' after a weekend without
heating.
For the individual conserver, saving
energy means turning off unneeded
lights, reducing heat levels, keeping
doors and windows closed to minimize
heat or air conditioning losses, and
halting or reducing use of unnecessary
electrical equipment. "Cutbacks at the
individual level are the first step in the
recognition of the problem," DeYoung
says.
Move over, William Simon.
After Plant Services Director Dan
DeYoung appeared on KZSU's
Campus Conference last Nov. 6 to
announce the beginning of a concerted
effort to cut back campus energy use,
his secretary pasted a bright orange
star on his office door and jokingly
referred to him as Stanford's own
"energy czar."
If DeYoung is a target for the
good-natured kidding of Plant Services
employees, it's because his increasingly
visible role as an energy conservation
policy-maker has also made him a
campus newsmaker. But he doesn't
mind. In fact, he welcomes the
publicity.
"To get community support for
energy conservation, you've got to
have public relations," he admits.
But Stanford's energy czar doesn't
rely on campus media coverage alone
to communicate with consumers. He
has launched a publicity effort of his
own.
Reminders Posted
Fluorescent orange stickers
plastered on exit doors, light switches,
electrical equipment, and maintenance
vehicle bumpers remind potential
energy-wasters all over the campus to
"Kill a Watt," or "Off it—and Save
Energy." An "Energy Bulletin" keeps
energy-savers informed of the progress
of their conservation efforts.
Other conservation campaign
measures are "just for fun," DeYoung
acknowledges. One flashy sticker asks
students to "shower in the dark and
save energy." Candlelight dinners in

student residences are a popular fringe
benefit of the effort to trim energy
use.
Although the student who spends
ten minutes in the shower stall
without turning on the 60-watt
overhead lightbulb may feel that he is
an integral part of Stanford's attempts
to squeeze by the energy crunch, his
individual contribution to measurable
energy savings is negligible. By "offing
it"he saves .01 kilowatt-hour (kwhr)
of electrical energy, which would have
slashed a mere .0135 cents from the

University's $82,000 Pacific Gas and
Electric (PG&E) bill for February.
(One kwhr of electrical energy, the
amount used by an average electric
toaster for one hour of continuous
operation, costs the University 1.35
cents.)
Saving Energy, Not Money
Similarly, if the residents of one
row house ate dinner by candlelight
every night for one month, they would
conserve approximately 27 kwhr (36.5
cents-worth) of electricity by burning
seven of the 1200 candles of

University Food Service purchased in a
recent "conservation" move that saved
energy, but not dollars.
DeYoung doesn't mind that the
cost of a particular energy
consciousness-raising program
sometimes overbalances its measurable
contribution to the University-wide
energy use cutback effort.
"The important thing about the
public relations program is that it is
raising people's tolerance for reduction
of energy," he contends.
Because pre-energy shortage
lifestyles have habituated the average
energy consumer to use more heat or
lighting than he or she needs, some
find it difficult to trim energy use
back to essentials. Although the most
organized opposition to energy
conservation moves came from
unmarried residents of Escondido
Village who threatened the University
with a lawsuit when they were asked
to leave their apartments during the
