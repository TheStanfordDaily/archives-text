# Skornia Seeks Votes Here For Congressional Contest
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Democratic Congressional
contender Tom Skornia brought his
primary campaign to Stanford
yesterday morning by shaking hands
and distributing flyers outside Maples
Pavilion.
"The Palo Alto-Menlo Park area
will have to be the heart of my
campaign," Skornia told the Daily. "If
I don't win this area, then I won't win
anywhere."
A 39-year-old Palo Alto attorney
who has been active in liberal
Democratic politics since the early

1960'5, Skornia is one of four
candidates for the Democratic
nomination in the newly-formed 12th
Congressional District. He expects his
toughest opposition from Santa Clara
Mayor Gary Gillmor.
'Gillmor Would Win Today'
"If the primary were held today,
I'm sure Gillmor would win, just
because his name is so well-known to
the voters," said Skornia. "He's going
to be difficult to beat in places like
Santa Clara and Mountain View."
Skornia said he plans to stress
official integrity, the economy,

women's rights, and campaign
spending as the major issues in his
campaign.
"I support a return to the
government economic policies of the
Kennedy administration, policies
which proved very sucessful," Skornia
stated. He called women's rights the
"hidden issue" of the campaign,
noting that "any issue that vitally
affects 53 percent of the voters cannot
be overlooked."
Public Campaign Funds
Skornia advocated public financing
of all candidates in both primary and
general elections. "My program would
call for partial government financing,
say three dollars of public money to
every dollar of private contributions,"
he said. "To discourage hopeless
candidates from using public money,
the government would supply a certain
amount of funding for every signature
or small contribution received."
Skornia noted that incumbents,
who have much more widespread
exposure than their challengers, might
be granted less money from the
government. "These days, though,
being an incumbent can be a very great
detriment, too," he added.
Both Gillmor and Rep. Paul
McCloskey, R.-Menlo Park, have
supported spending ceilings for the
June primary elections. Gillmor has
proposed a limit of $15,000 for each
candidate; the spending would be
regulated by a non-partisan board of
review. McCloskey has advocated a
much more liberal $75,000 limit in his
primary battle with conservative J.
Gordon Knapp.

Skornia noted that incumbents,
who have much more widespread
exposure than their challengers, might
be granted less money from the
government. "These days, though,
being an incumbent can be a very great
detriment, too," he added.
Both Gillmor and Rep. Paul
McCloskey, R.-Menlo Park, have
supported spending ceilings for the
June primary elections. Gillmor has
proposed a limit of $15,000 for each
candidate; the spending would be
regulated by a non-partisan board of
review. McCloskey has advocated a
much more liberal $75,000 limit in his
primary battle with conservative J.
Gordon Knapp.

SORE HANDS???—Tom Skornia leaf letted and shook the hands of rain-spattered students at Maples Pavillion during
registration yesterday. Skornia is running for the new 12th Congressional District.
Democratic Congressional
contender Tom Skornia brought his
primary campaign to Stanford
yesterday morning by shaking hands
and distributing flyers outside Maples
Pavilion.
"The Palo Alto-Menlo Park area
will have to be the heart of my
campaign," Skornia told the Daily. "If
I don't win this area, then I won't win
anywhere."
A 39-year-old Palo Alto attorney
who has been active in liberal
Democratic politics since the early

1960'5, Skornia is one of four
candidates for the Democratic
nomination in the newly-formed 12th
Congressional District. He expects his
toughest opposition from Santa Clara
Mayor Gary Gillmor.
'Gillmor Would Win Today'
"If the primary were held today,
I'm sure Gillmor would win, just
because his name is so well-known to
the voters," said Skornia. "He's going
to be difficult to beat in places like
Santa Clara and Mountain View."
Skornia said he plans to stress
official integrity, the economy,

women's rights, and campaign
spending as the major issues in his
campaign.
"I support a return to the
government economic policies of the
Kennedy administration, policies
which proved very sucessful," Skornia
stated. He called women's rights the
"hidden issue" of the campaign,
noting that "any issue that vitally
affects 53 percent of the voters cannot
be overlooked."
Public Campaign Funds
Skornia advocated public financing
of all candidates in both primary and
general elections. "My program would
call for partial government financing,
say three dollars of public money to
every dollar of private contributions,"
he said. "To discourage hopeless
candidates from using public money,
the government would supply a certain
amount of funding for every signature
or small contribution received."
Skornia noted that incumbents,
who have much more widespread
exposure than their challengers, might
be granted less money from the
government. "These days, though,
being an incumbent can be a very great
detriment, too," he added.
