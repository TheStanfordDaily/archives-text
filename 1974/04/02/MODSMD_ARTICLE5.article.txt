# Slim Lead In Taylor Case
## 
### 
San Mateo County sheriffs officers
continue to check out leads in the
March 21 murder of Janet Ann Taylor,
21, who was strangled after leaving the
campus.
But Inspector Rudy Siemssen said
yesterday there has been no further
progress in the investigation, and there
are still no suspects in the case.
Explorer Scouts searching the area
near Sand Hill Road and Manzanita
Way—where Taylor's body was
discovered early last Monday, March
22—failed Saturday to locate Taylor's
purse. According to Siemssen, Taylor's
shoes and raincoat-belt were also
missing from the body, but were
discovered nearby last week.
Taylor, daughter of former
Stanford Athletic Director Charles A.
(Chuck) Taylor, was last seen
hitchhiking at the intersection of
Mayfield Avenue and Junipero Serra
Boulevard Sunday evening after
visiting friends on the Stanford
campus.
Siemssen told the Daily that
investigators have found no direct link
between the Taylor murder and the
Feb. 13, 1973 strangulation of Leslie
Marie Perlov of Los Altos, whose body
was found on Stanford land less than a
mile from the spot where Taylor was
last seen.
"There are some circumstantial
similarities [between the two
murders] and some dissimilarities,"
Siemssen said yesterday. "At this
point, you can just about draw any
conclusions you want."
Siemssen said investigators were
still checking a report from a witness
who saw a nervous man standing next
to a white auto at about 12:15 a.m.
last Monday near the entrance to
Searsville Lake, not far from the place
Taylor's body was later found.
"For now, it's still just what it
seems: a nervous man and a car. We're
still checking that one out."
