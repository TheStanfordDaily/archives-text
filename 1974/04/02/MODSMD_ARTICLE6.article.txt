# City Manager Addresses Council
## Sipel Outlines City's Priorities 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Palo Alto's main concern in the
future should be the maintenance of
its quality environment, City Manager
George Sipel told the Palo Alto City
Council last night.
In his State of the City speech —
the first of its kind ever delivered in
Palo Alto — Sipel noted that the city
"must continue to provide and protect
the positive aspects of the city that
have attracted so many of our
residents."
Sipel cited programs for the
protection of the environment, quality
homes, the park system, and cultural
and recreational facilities as examples
of the quality of life that the city must
maintain.
Environmental Concern
Palo Alto was one of the first cities
in the nation to hire an environmental
specialist, Sipel noted. He pointed out
that the city also has set up an
Architectural Review Board and
pioneered the undergrounding of
electrical lines.

But if the city is to continue to
provide its quality environment for its
residents, it must balance its programs
with financial realities, Sipel
emphasized.
In planning the 1974-75 budget —
which will be reviewed by the Council
this month — the city staff attempted
to maximize the efficiency of resource
allocation, Sipel said.
Low Cost, High Quality
"We must do everything we can to
insure that the costs of service remain
as low as possible without sacrificing
quality," he said.
The years of growth in the city in
terms of assessed valuation and
commercial and industrial square
footage are over, Sipel noted. But he
added that the city still enjoys a
favorable financial situation.
In addition to the usual services
provided for in the budget, a number
of emerging needs require special
attention, Sipel said. Accordingly,
Sipel pointed out the five areas that he
believes should be given the most

attention by the Council.
The major concern of the City
Council should be the setting of
priorities, Sipel said. The Council
should hasten to complete its
Comprehensive Plan, in order to
determine the direction of the city's
growth.
Transportation Important
Transportation should be the
second priority of the Council, Sipel
said. "The issues range from
determining the most efficient,
effective and economical form of
transit to protecting residential areas
from the incursion of through traffic,"
Sipel stated. "The City Council and
staff should allocate sufficient
resources to play an active role in
regional and sub-regional
decision-making on transportation."
Sipel urged that the Council make
housing its third major concern. "The
Council should consider ways of
producing new low/moderate income
units without Federal subsidies and
should determine the level of housing
conservation efforts desirable for the
community,' Sipel declared.
It is also important that the Council
expand, streamline and coordinate
community social services, Sipel said.
"In essence, the whole social service
area needs evaluation and the City's
role in it needs to be more clearly
defined," Sipel said.
"A final area of concern is
intergovernmental cooperation, Sipel
stated. 'The time has passed when
communities like Palo Alto can afford
to act like islands oblivious to
neighboring communities, Sipel said.
"Too many issues require regional and
sub-regional efforts in order to reach
acceptable solutions.
"The trend toward a regional
agency with authority and the
heightening of region-wide problems
such as growth management, pollution
control, and transportation point to
the need for local governments to
develop a philosophy of
intergovernmental relations."

allocation, Sipel said.
Low Cost, High Quality
"We must do everything we can to
insure that the costs of service remain
as low as possible without sacrificing
quality," he said.
The years of growth in the city in
terms of assessed valuation and
commercial and industrial square
footage are over, Sipel noted. But he
added that the city still enjoys a
favorable financial situation.
In addition to the usual services
provided for in the budget, a number
of emerging needs require special
attention, Sipel said. Accordingly,
Sipel pointed out the five areas that he
believes should be given the most

attention by the Council.
The major concern of the City
Council should be the setting of
priorities, Sipel said. The Council
should hasten to complete its
Comprehensive Plan, in order to
determine the direction of the city's
growth.
Transportation Important
Transportation should be the
second priority of the Council, Sipel
said. "The issues range from
determining the most efficient,
effective and economical form of
transit to protecting residential areas
from the incursion of through traffic,"
Sipel stated. "The City Council and
staff should allocate sufficient
resources to play an active role in
regional and sub-regional
decision-making on transportation."
Sipel urged that the Council make
housing its third major concern. "The
Council should consider ways of
producing new low/moderate income
units without Federal subsidies and
should determine the level of housing
conservation efforts desirable for the
community,' Sipel declared.
It is also important that the Council
expand, streamline and coordinate
community social services, Sipel said.
"In essence, the whole social service
area needs evaluation and the City's
role in it needs to be more clearly
defined," Sipel said.
"A final area of concern is
intergovernmental cooperation, Sipel
stated. 'The time has passed when
communities like Palo Alto can afford
to act like islands oblivious to
neighboring communities, Sipel said.
"Too many issues require regional and
sub-regional efforts in order to reach
acceptable solutions.
"The trend toward a regional
agency with authority and the
heightening of region-wide problems
such as growth management, pollution
control, and transportation point to
the need for local governments to
develop a philosophy of
intergovernmental relations."
Palo Alto's main concern in the
future should be the maintenance of
its quality environment, City Manager
George Sipel told the Palo Alto City
Council last night.
In his State of the City speech —
the first of its kind ever delivered in
Palo Alto — Sipel noted that the city
"must continue to provide and protect
the positive aspects of the city that
have attracted so many of our
residents."
Sipel cited programs for the
protection of the environment, quality
homes, the park system, and cultural
and recreational facilities as examples
of the quality of life that the city must
maintain.
Environmental Concern
Palo Alto was one of the first cities
in the nation to hire an environmental
specialist, Sipel noted. He pointed out
that the city also has set up an
Architectural Review Board and
pioneered the undergrounding of
electrical lines.

But if the city is to continue to
provide its quality environment for its
residents, it must balance its programs
with financial realities, Sipel
emphasized.
In planning the 1974-75 budget —
which will be reviewed by the Council
this month — the city staff attempted
to maximize the efficiency of resource
allocation, Sipel said.
