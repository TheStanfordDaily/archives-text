## Sterling's 25th 
### 
Twenty-five years ago this Friday, J.E. Wallace Sterling
succeeded the late Donald B. Tresidder as President of the
University. The change was more than ceremonial, as it was
Sterling, more than any other man, who is responsible for
the character of Stanford today.
During Sterling's term of office, which lasted until he
stepped down to become chancellor in 1968, Stanford grew
from a respected regional institution to an academic
institution renowned throughout the world. Sterling, and his
provost, Frederick E. Terman, were largely responsible for
upgrading the quality of the University's faculty.
Another accomplishment of Sterling's administration for
which students today can be grateful was the Stanford
Study of Undergraduate Education, which he launched in
1954. This complete review of the curriculum, an original
idea of Sterling's, began a trend toward less rigid
requirements for undergraduates.
The list of Sterling's accomplishments goes on and on. He
was largely responsible for changing the Stanford Medical
School from an antiquated institution located in San
Francisco to a new facility staffed by one of the finest
faculties in the world.
The expansion of Stanford did cause major problems. In
recent years, the growing dependence of the University on
federal funds and the need for an elaborate bureaucracy to
handle this expansion have been assailed by many.
However, the faults of the University resulting from
Sterling's programs were perhaps inevitable. There is no
doubt that the Stanford community has benefitted greatly
from the farsighted vision of J.E. Wallace Sterling.
