# On Alienation
## 
### 
Ann Roecker

Ours is an age of technological
devices designed to make life
simpler. Yet modern man finds
himself increasingly alienated
from what he really wants:
meaning in life and deep
happiness.
The hectic pace of life dictates
a succession of momentary
relationships. There is no time to
sit quietly and think meaningfully
about life. Our friendships are
fragmentary, our world is polluted
and life seems to slip through our
fingers at an ever increasing pace
without our ever getting a hold on
it.
When we escape the
psychiatrist's couch, we find
ourselves wondering when we can
rest. In fact, it is tempting to
consider some avenue of escape.
But what? Drugs? Alcohol?
Suicide?
Even if escape is possible,
where does it lead? Is there any
meaning to life, and if so, how can
we find it? Who has the answer?
Somehow we must find a way to
slow down and learn the answers
to the questions of our existence.
Biblical Claims
The Bible claims that man was
created as an integrated
personality, but at a definite point
in time and space man chose to
disobey his creator, thus
alienating himself from God. In
addition, man fell out of harmony
with himself, with other
individuals, and with the natural
world. Ever since that time, man
has found himself facing a
dilemma.
How can man be in harmony
with other men or with nature if
he does not experience harmony
in his own being? How can man
be in harmony with himself unless
he has freedom from guilt and can

come before God without fear?
And how can he experience peace
with God? This is the key.
Many have chosen to ignore
these questions, while others have
made their attempts to find
harmony with themselves and the
world. But in all the annals of
history we find only one man who
has lived such a life and exhibited
the power and authority needed
to help others find this life.
Jesus' Life Perfect
This man is Jesus of Nazareth,
who, after living a perfect life,
voluntarily gave up His life on a
Roman cross to prove His
credentials. He claimed to be the
Son of God and to have come to
earth so that men could
experience life in all its fullness.
Jesus Christ said His purpose
was to heal this division within
the very nature of man: "Come to
Me and I will give you rest â€” all of
you who work so hard ... let me
teach you; for I am gentle and
humble, and you shall find rest
for your souls (Matthew 11:28)."
'Good News' Spread
Paul of Tarsus, a brilliant
scholar who devoted his life to
spreading this good news, wrote,
"When someone becomes a
Christian he becomes a brand new
person inside. He is not the same
any more. A new life has begun!
(II Corinthians 5:17)."
Have you ever felt alientated
from other individulas? From the
world? Perhaps sometimes from
life itself? If so, why not
investigate the claims of the Bible
for yourself? See if Christ really
can make you a whole person at
peace with yourself, with God and
with the world.
