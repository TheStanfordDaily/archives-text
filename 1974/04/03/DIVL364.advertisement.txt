Nineteen students
unselfishly spent their
vacation in Europe so
you could have this
guide book.
Nineteen students from Harvard and Radcliffe scoured
Europe, Israel, Turkey, Morocco and the U.S.S.R. where they
made careful notes on all the places of interest, the places
where students can find help, and the places where you won't
have to spend a fortune to enjoy yourself.
Playboy Magazine says, "By far the best guide book for
the under-30 generation..!'
$3.95. As important as your passport and toothbrush.
On sale at your local book store.
