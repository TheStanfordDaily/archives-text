Second Revelation

the second revelation in two weeks
chat the president was too ill to carry
out his duties. Medical sources said
two weeks ago that his condition was
complicated by hemorrhoids.
In some of his public appearances
he has appeared tired and bloated.
Recently he traveled to the Soviet

scheduled spring trip to Japan and put
off a planned trip to Bonn to confer
with the West German chancellor,
Willy Brandt.
Weekend In The Country
Pompidou returned Monday from a
weekend at his country house near
Paris.
There had been speculation about
possible new presidential elections
during past months. Some potential
candidates mentioned were former
Premier Jacques Chaban-Delmas,
Finance Minister Valery Giscard
d'Estaing and the Socialist party
secretary general, Francois Mitterand.
Despite his intelligence and ability

as an administrator, Pompidou
throughout his public life was never an
easy man to know and found little
popularity among the French masses.
During a visit to the United States
in February 1970, Pompidou was
booed by thousands of demonstrators
who were protesting France's decision
to sell 110 jet fighter planes to Libya
and end arms sales to Israel. Extremely
angered, he called the demonstrators
"a stain on the face of America"and
President Nixon felt compelled to fly
to New York and apologize in person.
Although troubled by ill health,
Pompidou imposed his own distinctive
style on French politics and enjoyed
having his personal hand in French
foreign policy. He also did not hesitate
to change a number of policies of his
predecessor.

and end arms sales to Israel. Extremely
angered, he called the demonstrators
"a stain on the face of America"and
President Nixon felt compelled to fly
to New York and apologize in person.
Although troubled by ill health,
Pompidou imposed his own distinctive
style on French politics and enjoyed
having his personal hand in French
foreign policy. He also did not hesitate
to change a number of policies of his
predecessor.
PARIS (AP) — Georges Pompidou,
wno in his first and only election
campaign succeeded to the strong
French presidency built by Charles de
Gaulle, died yesterday of an
undisclosed illness. He was 62.

?')out his possible resignation.
The brief announcement from the
presidential palace said Pompidou died
at 9 p.m. — 4 p.m. EDT.
A few hours earlier, the president's
office said Pompidou was canceling all
appointments because of an unstated
illness.
The cause of death was not
immediately disclosed, but there had
been reports of various ailments,
including leukemia or some other form
of cancer.
Became President In 1969

France on June 15, 1969, defeating
Alain Poher, who had become acting

Second Revelation
The announcement earlier
yesterday of Pompidou's illness was
the second revelation in two weeks
chat the president was too ill to carry
out his duties. Medical sources said
two weeks ago that his condition was
complicated by hemorrhoids.
In some of his public appearances
he has appeared tired and bloated.
Recently he traveled to the Soviet
Union to confer with Communist
party leader Leonid Brezhnev, but in
the last few days he canceled a
scheduled spring trip to Japan and put
off a planned trip to Bonn to confer
with the West German chancellor,
Willy Brandt.
Weekend In The Country
Pompidou returned Monday from a
weekend at his country house near
Paris.
There had been speculation about
possible new presidential elections
during past months. Some potential
candidates mentioned were former
Premier Jacques Chaban-Delmas,
Finance Minister Valery Giscard
d'Estaing and the Socialist party
secretary general, Francois Mitterand.
Despite his intelligence and ability

as an administrator, Pompidou
throughout his public life was never an
easy man to know and found little
popularity among the French masses.
During a visit to the United States
in February 1970, Pompidou was
booed by thousands of demonstrators
who were protesting France's decision
to sell 110 jet fighter planes to Libya
and end arms sales to Israel. Extremely
angered, he called the demonstrators
"a stain on the face of America"and
President Nixon felt compelled to fly
to New York and apologize in person.
