# Crisis Vetoed?
## 
### 
Modison Grose

Those energy-conscious
Cassandras, who, like myself, were
unfortunate enough to have
traveled our nation's interstate
highway system recently,
undoubtedly realize that the silent
majority has vetoed the energy
crisis.
Receiving the "cue" from our
President (who has re-labeled the
"crisis" a mere "problem"), and
from the benevolent dictate of the
Arab nations, Americans are once
again racing station wagons and
luxury sedans to pots-of-gold at
rainbows' end.
Recently, I had occasion to
contemplate the grill of a speeding
semi-truck, which was
approaching the rear window of
my Fiat.
Gazing thereon, I paid silent
tribute to the citizens of Montana
and Wyoming. At the behest of
certain special interests they will
be encouraged to evacuate their
states (temporarily, of course)
during the next several decades,
while we strip-mine coal. In
flagrant disregard of our needs,
Mother Nature put that coal
several feet under the topsoils of
Wyoming and Montana, and
50... .

If no news is good news, surely
the AEC's blithe hopes for
one-thousand nuclear power
plants to grace our nation's shores
by the year 2000 should quiet the
perpetual worrywart.
Noticing America's headfirst
plunge into the second Nuclear
Age, that of numerous lightwater
reactors and the new fast breeder,
one might pray that the AEC does
not follow the way of most
governmental flesh and become a
self-perpetuating behemoth,
suppressing compromising safety
and efficiency statistics.
Finally, I was run completely
off the road. (There are, after all,
only so many lanes further to the
right on any freeway.) But I
appreciated the courtesy of my
fellow citizens.
So with a wave and a tear, I,
from a parked car, made a wish:
that we might pause from our
procreating activities long enough
to enlighten our egoism, and
consider the outcome, when men
do not conserve what is only
contingently theirs.
