# Kent Indictments--Justice Too Late?

The indictment of eight Ohio National
Guardsmen in the 1970 shooting deaths of
four Kent State University students raises
more questions than it answers.
And it may be too little, too late.
A federal grand jury in Cleveland Friday
charged the eight enlisted men with violating
the civil rights of the four dead and nine
wounded students. It is the first federal
indictment, and the first indictment against
Guardsmen, in the case.
The Guard gunfire on May 4, 1970, came
at the end of a weekend of often-ugly
confrontation between anti-war
demonstrators and law enforcement officers.
Sporadic Probes
Official and unofficial probes into the
shootings have been sporadic ever since. The
parents of the deceased students have had
little success in bringing the Guard to
account for the deaths.
Friday's indictment is their biggest victory
to date, but it undoubtedly will not mark the
end of their quest.
Eight enlisted men were indicted; the
grand jury named none of the Guard officers
or state officials who were in command at
Kent.
Furthermore, the indictment charges
"deprivation of rights under color of law,"
not the more serious charge of conspiracy to
violate civil rights.
Maximum Penalty
Maximum penalty under the indictment is
a $1000 fine and one year in jail unless an
individual defendant is linked to one or more
of the deaths, in which case he could receive
life in prison.
The federal investigation was reopened
last August by Elliot Richardson during his
brief tenure as Attorney General. There was
concern that the probe might cease when
William Saxbe became Attorney General,
since Saxbe, although not involved in the
events at Kent, was a Colonel in the Ohio
Guard when the shootings took place.

Sax be has, however, removed himself
from any participation in the case.
Early Investigations Ended
The first federal investigation ended in
August 1971 without the convening of a
grand jury. Then-Attorney General John
Mitchell declared that he was persuaded there
was no conspiracy among the Guardsmen,
and that prosecution of any of them would
not be successful.
The same evidence persuaded many
people otherwise, and pressure continued on
the Justice Department to reopen the case.
Leading the campaign were the parents of the
slain students, some of those who had been
wounded, and the United Methodist Church's
Board of Church and Society.
Their efforts on other legal fronts also
have been for the most part unavailing.
The Scranton Commission on Campus
Unrest called the Guard's gunfire
"unnecessary, unwarranted, and
inexcusable," concluding that while many
demonstrators had behaved improperly,
non-lethal methods could have restored civil
peace. But the Scranton Commission had no
prosecutorial authority.
State Jury Report
A special state grand jury investigated the
tragedy in the fall of 1970. Its report
absolved the National Guard, and indicted 24
students and a faculty member on rioting
charges.
The report went on to roundly criticize
large numbers of students, faculty, and
administrators at Kent as being responsible
for the deaths. A federal court ordered these
portions of the report expunged from the
public record, but refused to dismiss the
indictments.
Two of the 25 pleaded guilty, one was
acquitted, and one was convicted on minor
charges. The state then dropped the other 21
prosecutions "for lack of evidence."
Parents Sued Guard
The parents of Allison Krause, Jeffrey

Miller, Sandra Scheuer, and William
Schroeder sued the state, then-Gov. James
Rhodes, and commanding officers of the
Guard for damages for the death of the
students.
To date, state and federal courts have held
that the state's sovereign immunity and the
individuals' executive immunity prevent
them from being held liable. The question is
now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
No investigation has yet answered the
questions, "What precipitated the shooting?"
and "Who shot first?" The role of undercover
police agents in the Kent disorders also raises
curious, unsettling, and unanswered
questions.
Lawyers for the accused Guardsmen will
claim that the four-year delay has denied
them the right to a speedy trial.
Justice Denied?
Justice delayed is indeed justice denied.
Friday's indictments may be too late. The
time lag is put in perspective by considering
that since the shootings, the undergraduate
population of Kent and every other campus
has undergone a 100 percent turnover.
No investigation, no matter how vigorous,
can revive the dead or make the wounded
whole. What it can do is prevent future
tragedies. It can insure that those who
enforce the law are required to obey it. It can
make clear that two wrongs do not make a
right.
Nearly fifty years ago, Justice Louis
Brandeis wrote, that "Crime is contagious. If
the government becomes a lawbreaker, it
breeds contempt for law; it invites every man
to become a law unto himself; it invites
anarchy."
How much Friday's indictments mean
depends on whether they are the last step or
only the first step in bringing to justice those
responsibe for the Kent State tragedy.
