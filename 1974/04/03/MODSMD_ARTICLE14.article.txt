# Transplants And Legal Problems

The legislation proposed
Monday by Assemblyman Dixon
Arnett, Râ€”Redwood City, goes a
long way toward establishing
criteria which help to define legal
death. If passed, the bill will allow
surgeons to perform transplants
without the threat of a
malpractice suit or being charged
with murder.
Currently, California law
regarding transplants states that a
doctor must declare a potential
donor dead, but does not establish
any criteria to be used. The
proposed legislation does not
actually define brain death, but
states that a person may be
pronounced dead if he has
suffered an irreversible cessation
of brain function, even though his
heart may still be beating.
The brain-death criteria,
currently used by many
physicians, was drafted at the
Harvard University Medical
School. It defines brain-death as:
no brain activity recorded by
electroencephalograms made 24
hours apart; inability to breathe
spontaneously; and lack of
response to stimulation.
Passage Holds Key
The passage of this bill may
hold the key to the progress in

organ transplants. According to
Dr. Thomas Beme, director of the
transplant unit at Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center, 237
persons in California received
kidney transplants out of 574
who needed them in 1972. In
1973, he added, only 175 out of
642 received kidneys.
The same trend appears to be
true in heart transplants, with
many surgeons appearing to be
unwilling to perform the
operation. Dr. Norman Shumway
of the Stanford Medical Center
has performed two transplants
within the last year in which a
beating heart was removed from a
"dead" donor. One donor had
been assaulted and the other had
been in an automobile accident.
In the ensuing court cases, the
defense attorneys charged that the
donors died because their hearts
were removed, rather than as a
result of their clients' actions.
Case Dismissed
Interestingly, a municipal court
judge in Santa Rosa dismissed the
case against a defendant standing
trial for manslaughter, implying
that the doctors were responsible
for the death. That decision was
later reversed by a superior court
judge, and the defendant is

currently on trial.
In the other case involving a
Shumway transplant, an Oakland
municipal court judge ruled that
the defendant must stand trial on
murder charges, despite his
attorney's argument that since the
heart was beating when removed,
the operation rather than the
bullet killed the donor.
Malpractice Suit?
If either of the defendants is
not convicted, the physicians,
including Shumway, could find
themselves named in a malpractice
suit. In a previous case in Virginia

in which a $100,000 lawsuit was
filed against four doctors the jury
ruled that brain-death was
sufficient for organ removal and
the suit was denied.
Although it may seem
far-fetched, the situation could
arise where a defendant was
acquitted of the donor's death,
and the doctors also were not held
responsible. That would leave a
dead victim and nobody legally
responsible for the death'. Arnett's
bill would assure that nothing like
this could happen.
