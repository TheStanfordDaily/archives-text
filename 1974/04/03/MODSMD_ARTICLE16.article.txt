# What Do We Get Here?

Lately there has been a rash of
articles and reports concernir ;
both student awareness (or lack of
it) and what we are all getting (or
supposed to be getting) out of our
Stanford experience. But it seems
to me that any valid point is often
lost in the incredible amount of
verbiage through which we are
forced to sift.
I have a theory myself, just like
a lot of other persons who like to
see their names on page two of
the Daily. It is simply this:
Stanford builds machines, not
men. The result is that Stanford
graduates may well be prepared
for their jobs (e.g., engineers) c...
for grad school (e.g., pre-meds)
but in too many cases for little
else.
The Stanford experience
propagandized in Approaching
Stanford has come for too many
of us to be built on GPA, whether
we admit it or not. Probably the
scariest thing is that it is not
merely our stereotyped,
grade-grabbing pre-Meds who are
zeroing in on GPA like kamikaze
pilots.
It's also a lot of psychology
and economics majors too. Th*
curious thing about many of these
people is that they often hide
behind the mask of calling others
"red hots" and then run for the
nearest nook or cranny to study
their gazoombas off, hiding away
like a twelve year-old who is
paranoid of being caugh.
masturbating by his mother.
Other Considerations
Of course we all want to do
well. However, there are a lot of
good things in life besides GPA.
How about the symphony? or
Mickey's Big Mouths? Or the
farmworkers boycott?
The assertion here is not that
no one cares about anything any
more. Except for a few tutors, not
many people are involved.
This does not necessarily mean
I advocate throwing rocks and
taking to the streets again simply
because we still have to deal with
the likes of Richard Nixon
(though it wouldn't be a bad
idea). But things like valentines
painted on the wall around Mem
Claw and streaking are distressing
signs of the times.
I'd have to say it makes one
wonder what effect being in too
sterile an academic environment
has had on many members of our
pre-professionally oriented
community.
Nixon Jokes
Instead of arguing further, I
submit for your reading pleasure
the following letter (unedited) I
recently received from my eleven
year-old sister.
"Dear Tim,
"I'm writing you because I
want to tell you three jokes.
"1. Nixon and Pat were going
somewhere in his plane when
Nixon said, 'I think I'll throw 50,
50 dollar bills out the window and
make 50 people happy.' Then Pat
said, 'Why don't you throw 100,
100 dollar bills out the window
and make 100 people happy?'
Then the pilot walked down the
aisle and said (to Dick), 'Why
don't I just throw you out the
window and make everyone
happy?'
"2. Draw three lines to make a
crooked man in a crooked house.

"3. Nixon was getting worried,
real worried, so he told Pat he was
going out for a walk. So he
walked and walked until he finally
found himself in front of the
Lincoln Memorial. So he said,
'Abe, what am I going to do?'
And Abe looks up and then says,
'Dick, how about a night at the
theatre?'
"Goodbye and hope you
enjoyed the jokes.
Your friend,
Marybeth Peterson"
On the back of the envelope
she had written in big letters:
"IMPEACH NIXON!"
The point of this whole thing is
that I think my little sister is more
politically aware than a high
percentage of Stanford students.
You may laugh, but if there is a
morsel of truth here, I think we're
in big trouble.
For those who do not
understand the reasoning here,
don't worry. Like so many others,
four or so years at Stanford will
surely have prepared you to do
your job, too, if nothing else.
