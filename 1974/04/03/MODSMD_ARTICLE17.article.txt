# Campus 'Energy Czar' Explains Cut-Back Efforts
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Second of Three Parts
Between Nov. 1 and Jan. 20,
Stanford reduced its electricity
consumption by 6.5 million
kilowatt hours (kwhr) and cut
heating fuel use by 2.5 million
therms, a 20 percent reduction
from 1072-73 levels. Stanford's
"energy czar," plant services
director Dan DeYoung, estimates
that personal conservation efforts
of campus consumers have
accounted for about one-fifth of
the total reduction.
Actually, the energy
consciousness of individuals is an
even smaller part of the long-range
solution to the University's energy
woes. The energy problems of a
sprawling, contemporary campus
are rooted in the pervasive
pre-energy crisis values that
punctuated the design philosophy
under which most of its buildings
were designed or renovated, and
which provided energy-foolish
guidelines the University could
afford to follow — until recently.
Even the so-called energy crisis
of the 70s has not prompted a
return to the strictly enforced
policies that prevailed when both
Stanford and modern energy
technology were in their infancies.
In 1911, undergraduate C.O.
Dingle found out what happened
to those who got caught violating
the rules when he received a letter
signed by then-President John C.
Branner. The letter informed
Dingle that he would face
disciplinary action unless he
removed an unauthorized
"student lamp" from his Encina
Hall dorm room.
Warm Old Buildings
The earliest Stanford buildings
were constructed with thick walls
and small windows for maximum
insulation. During recent heating
shutdowns, DeYoung found that
old, unrenovated buildings were
better heat retainers than
remodeled or recently constructed
structures. As the University
expands, it uses more and more
energy less and less wisely.
The newest buildings — the
Graduate School of Business, the
Earth Sciences Building, Meyer
Library, and the Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching — are the most
gluttonous energy-eaters,
DeYoung says. Meyer Library, for
example, requires five times as
much energy per square foot than
does the old Main Library.
Enormous quantities of energy
are needed to operate modern air
circulation systems, and what heat

or air-conditioning doesn't get
pushed out by the blowers leaks
out through huge glass windows.
Modern structures waste
electricity as well as the fuel that
produces steam to heat or cool
them. "In the old days,"
DeYoung explains, "they placed
lamps where people wanted to use
them." Today, banks of
everburning fluorescent lights line
the ceilings, allowing maximum
room use flexibility but requiring
maximum energy use.
"The old argument for always
leaving the lights on took into
consideration the cost of
replacement bulbs and
maintenance manpower,"
DeYoung says. "Energy use was
never a consideration. Now we see
the finite limits on energy and pay
less attention to the cost of men
and bulbs."
DeYoung Worksln Daylight
DeYoung rarely turns on the
lights in his own office during the
daytime. He works at his desk
using ample available light that
streams in through the office
window.
But the largest energy savings
result when plant services
eliminates lighting and other
equipment that was never really
needed in the first place. Not only
does the campus energy czar ask
the consumer to flick the switch
less often; there is also less energy
used when he does.
Most buildings are overiit,
DeYoung observes, pointing out
that the people who set lighting
standards are usually the same
people who manufacture lighting
equipment. One-third of the
lightbulbs were removed from the
president's office in Bldg. 10.
Plant services took out nearly half
the lightbulbs in the Earth
Sciences library, and all but a few
lights were removed from the
unused second-floor entrance area
in UGLY.
Bulb Removal Negligible
In no case have lightbulb
removals caused lighting levels to
fall below even overinflated
standards, DeYoung adds. And he
is concerned with campus security
as well as health and safety.
High intensity security lights,
installed several years ago as a
deterrent to rock-throwing
student protesters, still burn every
night. Necessary exterior lighting
is now turned off by timing
devices during daylight hours —
formerly it was allowed to burn
continuously. Decorative outdoor
lighting has been reduced a
minimum.

Diffusion panels for modern
indoor lighting often prevent
much of a lightbulb's power from
reaching the user. New panels
block up to 30 percent, while
some that have yellowed with age
and dirt block over 60 percent. In
the past, planners have purposely
squandered energy by using
thicker diffusion materials.
When users of the Skilling
building complained several years
ago that bright lights there made
reading difficult, designers
discovered that lighting levels
exceeded the recommended 70
foot-candles by 30-50
foot-candles. They added an
additional layer of plastic
light-block material to reduce
lighting to required levels.
Recently, plant services did
what the energy-foolish designers
should have done then. They
removed the extra diffusion
material and achieved a
comfortable reading light level by
removing a sufficient number of
bulbs.
