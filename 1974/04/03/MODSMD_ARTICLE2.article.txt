# Six Fee Assessments On Ballot
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Six fee assessments will be voted on
the upcoming April 17 and 18
election. Students collected enough
signatures to put four fee assessments
on the ballot; the ASSU Senate voted
last night to add another two.
The assessments put on the ballot
by petition are:
—$1 for the Stanford chapter of the
Northern California Public Interest
Research Group, an organization
created to do research concerning
social and political issues.
Guest Professorship
—$1 for the ASSU guest
professorship program intended to
bring important political and social
figures to teach on campus at the
ASSU's invitation. ASSU President
Kevin O'Grady said this program ha;
existed in the past when general ASSU
funds supported it. He said the
program needs funds from the student
body now, because the funding
formerly given by the University no
longer exists.
—$1 for the Stanford Band.
—$2 for KZSU, $1 for autumn and
$1 for spring quarter. KZSU workers
staged a last minute rush, collecting
enough signatures to ensure their fee
assessment would be on the ballot
whether or not the Senate passed it.
Assessments
The assessments the ASSU Senate
voted to put on the ballot are:
—$1 for the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, an organization to bring
important political and social figures
to speak here.
—$2 for the ASSU Legal Counseling
Office, $1 for next autumn and $1 for
spring quarter. Glenn Schofield, an
attorney who works in the office,
delivered a report to the Senate on
client load, types of service, and next
year's budget
O'Grady also reported enough
signatures have been collected to put
on the ballot a resolution to invite
imprisoned South Vietnamese
journalist Nguyen Huu Thai as ASSU
guest professor. O'Grady said this
resolution is an attempt to create
publicity which would pressure the

regime of South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu to release Thai.
On April 10 and 11, students will
choose between six slates of
candidates running for ASSU Council
of Presidents. If no slate receives a
majority of the votes cast, a runoff
will be held April 17 and 18 between
the two slates with the most votes.
The new slate will succeed the
current ASSU Council of Presidents —
Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree and Jim Friend —

immediately after a winner is
determined. The O'Grady slate won
last year after a slate headed by former
ASSU Vice President Peter Van Petten
decided to drop out of the runoff. The
O'Grady slate had received just under
50 percent of the primary vote.
The Senate also passed a resolution
urging dormitories to donate 10
percent of their house dues to a
church relief agency distributing aid to
several African countries suffering
from a long drought.
