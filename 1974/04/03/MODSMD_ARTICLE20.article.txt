# Horse Racing Fans Watch Horses... And Other Fans
## 
### BOB LOWE 
The room is huge and coldly
institutional. Big pillars support
the gray, concrete ceiling and
scraps of paper litter the floor.
A few men stand around,
leaning on cigarette machines or
against the pillars. Their shoulders
are slouched and heads are bent
forward as each studies a thin,
blue-covered booklet.
It's chilly and the odor of
cigars hangs in the air. Overhead,
florescent lights glare harshly, and
blue and white signs reading
"Cashiers" and "Sellers" hang
from the ceiling.
It's Thursday night at Bay
Meadows Race Track in San
Mateo.
Although Bay Meadows is only
25 minutes from Stanford by car,
few students have been there. To
most it is just a sign and an
expanse of bright lights between
here and San Francisco.
Races usually run on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday nights, and
Sunday and Monday afternoons,
except during the summer. From
January through early March,
harness races are the attraction.

After that they are replaced by
quarter horse races.
Although the races themselves
are entertaining, the reason most
people come, especially on a
Thursday, is for the betting.
Two Stanford students, Doug
Farenstock and Maggie Kern, have
been to Bay Meadows twice. "We
enjoy light betting," Kern says.
"But, if it were only that, we'd go
to any races — like the dog races.
It's exciting watching the horses
run,too."
Betting Action
Two dollars admits one
customer to outside grandstands
and the large room underneath
where betting windows are
located. At times there is more
action in the room under the
stands than out on the track.
A trumpet flourish blares out
over the loud speaker system. It is
15 minutes to post time and
people file out of the stands and
down to the room.
Most of the people are older
men — many are Bay Meadows
regulars. But, younger men and
women sprinkle the crowd and a
few children trail behind parents.

Everyone is absorbed in his
blue-covered racing program, busy
planning bets for the next race.
Six minutes to post time. As if
on cue, everyone surges toward a
row of betting windows. Lines
form in front of windows which
display signs like "$2 Win" and
"$5 Place and Show."
The room is warm with people
and hazy with cigar smoke. Ticket
machines clatter like machine
guns as hundreds of bettors place
their bets.
A rotund, red-faced woman
steps up to a $2 Win" window.
Wearing a red and white cap,
bright green coat, and red shoes,
she shoves her stomach up against
the window.
"One, three, six and seven,"
she says, thrusting a ten dollar bill
at the seller inside the window.
She walks away clutching four
white tickets and a pair of one
dollar bills.
Post Time
"It's now post time," a voice
barks out over the speakers.
People scurry frantically to place
last minute bets. Everyone takes a
final glance at the numbers on the
odds board to see how well their
bets will pay.
"Heeere they come!" the loud
speaker shouts. A wave of people
move toward the outside
grandstands and the room empties
quickly.
Outside on the track, eight
brown horses trot behind a white
car which carries a movable
starting gate: a huge ladder-like
contraption extending from the
car like wings from an airplane.
A sulky is attached behind
each horse. Each one looks like a
seat perched on top of two wheels
and two, thin poles extending in
front are strapped to the horse's
harness. Jockies, garbed in
colorful silk shirts, caps, and
white pants sit atop the sulkies.
As the car and horses pass the
start-finish pole, the car speeds up
«nd pulls ahead and off the track.
The horses merge in a confusing
mass and then spread apart as
they find their positions close to
the rail.
"Andy's Clarice is in front!"
the announcer shouts. "Bethany
Bay is second! Fleeting Glimpse —

third! And, Johnny's Love is
moving up on the outside."
A minute later and the horses
are on the far side of the track.
They are a moving blob of brown,
slowly changing shape as they
change position.
They round the last turn and
being the final, home stretch. As
they draw close to the finish and
the grandstands, everyone is on
his feet. A low rumble begins in
the stands and progresses into a
roar.
In a blur of white taped hoofs,
spinning wheels and colorful
shirts, the horses speed by the
crowd and across the finish.
The stands are silent. Many
people dejectedly drop their
tickets. Others jump out of their
seats, hurrying down to the
betting room and holding their
winning tickets tightly.
The room is quiet as small lines
form before the cashiers'
windows. A man in dark glasses
and black business suit walks by,
muttering to himself. "Son of a
bitch. Waited all ing day to
come up."
The Winners Collect
In front of "$2 Win," the
winners wait in line to collect on
their bets. They stand silently,
already planning their next

wagers.
In front of "$lO Win," a tall,
young man in a light blue business
suit waits in line. A Benson and
Hedges cigarette hangs out of his
mouth.
It is his turn at the window.
Wearing a self-satisfied smile, he
hands his ticket to the cashier and
receives a handful of bills.
Thumbing through his money,
he begins to walk away, but stops.
He turns back toward the window
and then discovers an additional
five dollar bill stuck behind
another.
Chuckling at himself — or at
his luck — he turns and swaggers
away, stuffing the wad of bills
into his pocket.

expanse of bright lights between
here and San Francisco.
Races usually run on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday nights, and
Sunday and Monday afternoons,
except during the summer. From
January through early March,
harness races are the attraction.

After that they are replaced by
quarter horse races.
Although the races themselves
are entertaining, the reason most
people come, especially on a
Thursday, is for the betting.
Two Stanford students, Doug
Farenstock and Maggie Kern, have
been to Bay Meadows twice. "We
enjoy light betting," Kern says.
"But, if it were only that, we'd go
to any races — like the dog races.
It's exciting watching the horses
run,too."
Betting Action
Two dollars admits one
customer to outside grandstands
and the large room underneath
where betting windows are
located. At times there is more
action in the room under the
stands than out on the track.
A trumpet flourish blares out
over the loud speaker system. It is
15 minutes to post time and
people file out of the stands and
down to the room.
Most of the people are older
men — many are Bay Meadows
regulars. But, younger men and
women sprinkle the crowd and a
few children trail behind parents.

Everyone is absorbed in his
blue-covered racing program, busy
planning bets for the next race.
Six minutes to post time. As if
on cue, everyone surges toward a
row of betting windows. Lines
form in front of windows which
display signs like "$2 Win" and
"$5 Place and Show."
The room is warm with people
and hazy with cigar smoke. Ticket
machines clatter like machine
guns as hundreds of bettors place
their bets.
A rotund, red-faced woman
steps up to a $2 Win" window.
Wearing a red and white cap,
bright green coat, and red shoes,
she shoves her stomach up against
the window.
"One, three, six and seven,"
she says, thrusting a ten dollar bill
at the seller inside the window.
She walks away clutching four
white tickets and a pair of one
dollar bills.
Post Time
"It's now post time," a voice
barks out over the speakers.
People scurry frantically to place
last minute bets. Everyone takes a
final glance at the numbers on the
odds board to see how well their
bets will pay.
"Heeere they come!" the loud
speaker shouts. A wave of people
move toward the outside
grandstands and the room empties
quickly.
Outside on the track, eight
brown horses trot behind a white
car which carries a movable
starting gate: a huge ladder-like
contraption extending from the
car like wings from an airplane.
A sulky is attached behind
each horse. Each one looks like a
seat perched on top of two wheels
and two, thin poles extending in
front are strapped to the horse's
harness. Jockies, garbed in
colorful silk shirts, caps, and
white pants sit atop the sulkies.
As the car and horses pass the
start-finish pole, the car speeds up
«nd pulls ahead and off the track.
The horses merge in a confusing
mass and then spread apart as
they find their positions close to
the rail.
"Andy's Clarice is in front!"
the announcer shouts. "Bethany
Bay is second! Fleeting Glimpse —

third! And, Johnny's Love is
moving up on the outside."
A minute later and the horses
are on the far side of the track.
They are a moving blob of brown,
slowly changing shape as they
change position.
They round the last turn and
being the final, home stretch. As
they draw close to the finish and
the grandstands, everyone is on
his feet. A low rumble begins in
the stands and progresses into a
roar.
In a blur of white taped hoofs,
spinning wheels and colorful
shirts, the horses speed by the
crowd and across the finish.
The stands are silent. Many
people dejectedly drop their
tickets. Others jump out of their
seats, hurrying down to the
betting room and holding their
winning tickets tightly.
The room is quiet as small lines
form before the cashiers'
windows. A man in dark glasses
and black business suit walks by,
muttering to himself. "Son of a
bitch. Waited all ing day to
come up."
The Winners Collect
In front of "$2 Win," the
winners wait in line to collect on
their bets. They stand silently,
already planning their next

wagers.
In front of "$lO Win," a tall,
young man in a light blue business
suit waits in line. A Benson and
Hedges cigarette hangs out of his
mouth.
It is his turn at the window.
Wearing a self-satisfied smile, he
hands his ticket to the cashier and
receives a handful of bills.
Thumbing through his money,
he begins to walk away, but stops.
He turns back toward the window
and then discovers an additional
five dollar bill stuck behind
another.
Chuckling at himself — or at
his luck — he turns and swaggers
away, stuffing the wad of bills
into his pocket.

customer to outside grandstands
and the large room underneath
where betting windows are
located. At times there is more
action in the room under the
stands than out on the track.
A trumpet flourish blares out
over the loud speaker system. It is
15 minutes to post time and
people file out of the stands and
down to the room.
Most of the people are older
men — many are Bay Meadows
regulars. But, younger men and
women sprinkle the crowd and a
few children trail behind parents.

Everyone is absorbed in his
blue-covered racing program, busy
planning bets for the next race.
Six minutes to post time. As if
on cue, everyone surges toward a
row of betting windows. Lines
form in front of windows which
display signs like "$2 Win" and
"$5 Place and Show."
The room is warm with people
and hazy with cigar smoke. Ticket
machines clatter like machine
guns as hundreds of bettors place
their bets.
A rotund, red-faced woman
steps up to a $2 Win" window.
Wearing a red and white cap,
bright green coat, and red shoes,
she shoves her stomach up against
the window.
"One, three, six and seven,"
she says, thrusting a ten dollar bill
at the seller inside the window.
She walks away clutching four
white tickets and a pair of one
dollar bills.
Post Time
"It's now post time," a voice
barks out over the speakers.
People scurry frantically to place
last minute bets. Everyone takes a
final glance at the numbers on the
odds board to see how well their
bets will pay.
"Heeere they come!" the loud
speaker shouts. A wave of people
move toward the outside
grandstands and the room empties
quickly.
Outside on the track, eight
brown horses trot behind a white
car which carries a movable
starting gate: a huge ladder-like
contraption extending from the
car like wings from an airplane.
A sulky is attached behind
each horse. Each one looks like a
seat perched on top of two wheels
and two, thin poles extending in
front are strapped to the horse's
harness. Jockies, garbed in
colorful silk shirts, caps, and
white pants sit atop the sulkies.
As the car and horses pass the
start-finish pole, the car speeds up
«nd pulls ahead and off the track.
The horses merge in a confusing
mass and then spread apart as
they find their positions close to
the rail.
"Andy's Clarice is in front!"
the announcer shouts. "Bethany
Bay is second! Fleeting Glimpse —

third! And, Johnny's Love is
moving up on the outside."
A minute later and the horses
are on the far side of the track.
They are a moving blob of brown,
slowly changing shape as they
change position.
They round the last turn and
being the final, home stretch. As
they draw close to the finish and
the grandstands, everyone is on
his feet. A low rumble begins in
the stands and progresses into a
roar.
In a blur of white taped hoofs,
spinning wheels and colorful
shirts, the horses speed by the
crowd and across the finish.
The stands are silent. Many
people dejectedly drop their
tickets. Others jump out of their
seats, hurrying down to the
betting room and holding their
winning tickets tightly.
The room is quiet as small lines
form before the cashiers'
windows. A man in dark glasses
and black business suit walks by,
muttering to himself. "Son of a
bitch. Waited all ing day to
come up."
The Winners Collect
In front of "$2 Win," the
winners wait in line to collect on
their bets. They stand silently,
already planning their next

wagers.
In front of "$lO Win," a tall,
young man in a light blue business
suit waits in line. A Benson and
Hedges cigarette hangs out of his
mouth.
It is his turn at the window.
Wearing a self-satisfied smile, he
hands his ticket to the cashier and
receives a handful of bills.
Thumbing through his money,
he begins to walk away, but stops.
He turns back toward the window
and then discovers an additional
five dollar bill stuck behind
another.
Chuckling at himself — or at
his luck — he turns and swaggers
away, stuffing the wad of bills
into his pocket.

HORSE AND BUGGY—It's a return to the days before the
automobile. Harness racing at Bay Meadows is another attraction
available to students here.

A SURE BET — Race fans from all walks of life come to Bay
Meadows to try their luck on the horses.
The room is huge and coldly
institutional. Big pillars support
the gray, concrete ceiling and
scraps of paper litter the floor.
A few men stand around,
leaning on cigarette machines or
against the pillars. Their shoulders
are slouched and heads are bent
forward as each studies a thin,
blue-covered booklet.
It's chilly and the odor of
cigars hangs in the air. Overhead,
florescent lights glare harshly, and
blue and white signs reading
"Cashiers" and "Sellers" hang
from the ceiling.
It's Thursday night at Bay
Meadows Race Track in San
Mateo.
Although Bay Meadows is only
25 minutes from Stanford by car,
few students have been there. To
most it is just a sign and an
expanse of bright lights between
here and San Francisco.
Races usually run on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday nights, and
Sunday and Monday afternoons,
except during the summer. From
January through early March,
harness races are the attraction.

After that they are replaced by
quarter horse races.
Although the races themselves
are entertaining, the reason most
people come, especially on a
Thursday, is for the betting.
Two Stanford students, Doug
Farenstock and Maggie Kern, have
been to Bay Meadows twice. "We
enjoy light betting," Kern says.
"But, if it were only that, we'd go
to any races — like the dog races.
It's exciting watching the horses
run,too."
