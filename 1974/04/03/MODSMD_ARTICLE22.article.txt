# Course To Analyze Biomedical Ethics
## 
### 
Medical Center News Service
"The lag between the advanced
state of technology and our
ability to handle it at the human
level indicates a pressing need for
ethical guidelines in biology and
medicine."
So says Dr. Ernie Young,
acting chaplain of the University
Hospital. He is teaching the
School of Medicine's first course
on biomedical ethics, this spring
quarter.
Young, who is also visiting
assistant dean of Stanford
Memorial Church, has been
associated with Hospitals in
Dallas, Tex. and in his native
Johannesburg, South Africa. It
was his suggestion to offer such a
course for Stanford medical
students.
The course, which meets
Wednesday evenings, includes
theory as well as specific
applications. "There seems to be a
need for an ethical framework
within which scientists and
physicians may base their
actions," explains Young. "The
theoretical portion will provide a
background that will help them in
making concrete decisions."
Ethical issues at all stages of
life will be examined. These
include genetic manipulation,
abortion, human experimentation
and euthanasia.
Although the course is
intended primarily for medical
students. Young welcomes
interaction with physicians, nurses
and other Medical Center staff on
the issues. He explains that
because the field of biomedical
ethics is still in the pioneering
stages, everyone has much to
learn.
Young belongs to a group of
West Coast medical ethics teachers
who meet periodically to share
resources. Their diverse
backgrounds — political, social,
philosophical as well as
theological — provide a rich pool
of ideas.
He also expects to benefit from
his own course. "I hope to open
up the questions rather than
provide the answers," the acting
chaplain says, "for there are no
simple solutions in this area. At
most, one can hope for a
thorough ventilation."
Medical students are
enthusiastic about the course.

"There seems to be a deficit of
discussion on certain aspects of
life throughout medical school
training," says fifth year student
Bill Hurlbut. "For instance,
students should be able to sit and
talk with others about death," he
said.
Young's course is a valuable
addition to the curriculum,
according to Dr. Count Gibson,
chairman of the Department of
Family, Community and
Preventive Medicine, which
sponsors the course. "At a time
when technological growth raises
more ethical problems than
solutions," Gibson notes, "it is
important that the life scientists
and ethicists collaborate to insure
human welfare."
He adds that Young's
willingness to develop a course on
biomedical ethics is particularly
welcome in view of his
background. A Methodist minister
in Johannesburg since 1956,
Young went to Southern
Methodist University in Dallas in
1967 to earn his Ph.D. in social
and political ethics.
"I hoped to acquire some new
means of entering into dialogue
with the Dutch Tteformed
Church, which supports the South
African government's policies of
racial segregation (apartheid)," he
says. However, when he returned
to his country four years later,
after receiving his degree, he
found that no meaningful
dialogue was possible. He left
again in 1973 for "reasons of
conscience."
He explains: "I cannot accept
the situation in South Africa
because it is incompatible with
the Christian ethic of love; nor as
a white English speaking person
can I change it (the blacks
themselves will have to). Under
the circumstances, I feel it would
be immoral to continue to benefit
from the privileges which a white
skin affords every South African."
Similar principles of conscience
and humanity are involved in
dealing with patients. "A patient
must be treated as a whole
person," Young says. "There are
dimensions of personality that
don't fit into the test tube or
conform to laboratory values, and
these spiritual aspects are as
important as the physical ones."

making concrete decisions."
Ethical issues at all stages of
life will be examined. These
include genetic manipulation,
abortion, human experimentation
and euthanasia.
Although the course is
intended primarily for medical
students. Young welcomes
interaction with physicians, nurses
and other Medical Center staff on
the issues. He explains that
because the field of biomedical
ethics is still in the pioneering
stages, everyone has much to
learn.
Young belongs to a group of
West Coast medical ethics teachers
who meet periodically to share
resources. Their diverse
backgrounds — political, social,
philosophical as well as
theological — provide a rich pool
of ideas.
He also expects to benefit from
his own course. "I hope to open
up the questions rather than
provide the answers," the acting
chaplain says, "for there are no
simple solutions in this area. At
most, one can hope for a
thorough ventilation."
Medical students are
enthusiastic about the course.

"There seems to be a deficit of
discussion on certain aspects of
life throughout medical school
training," says fifth year student
Bill Hurlbut. "For instance,
students should be able to sit and
talk with others about death," he
said.
Young's course is a valuable
addition to the curriculum,
according to Dr. Count Gibson,
chairman of the Department of
Family, Community and
Preventive Medicine, which
sponsors the course. "At a time
when technological growth raises
more ethical problems than
solutions," Gibson notes, "it is
important that the life scientists
and ethicists collaborate to insure
human welfare."
He adds that Young's
willingness to develop a course on
biomedical ethics is particularly
welcome in view of his
background. A Methodist minister
in Johannesburg since 1956,
Young went to Southern
Methodist University in Dallas in
1967 to earn his Ph.D. in social
and political ethics.
"I hoped to acquire some new
means of entering into dialogue
with the Dutch Tteformed
Church, which supports the South
African government's policies of
racial segregation (apartheid)," he
says. However, when he returned
to his country four years later,
after receiving his degree, he
found that no meaningful
dialogue was possible. He left
again in 1973 for "reasons of
conscience."
He explains: "I cannot accept
the situation in South Africa
because it is incompatible with
the Christian ethic of love; nor as
a white English speaking person
can I change it (the blacks
themselves will have to). Under
the circumstances, I feel it would
be immoral to continue to benefit
from the privileges which a white
skin affords every South African."
Similar principles of conscience
and humanity are involved in
dealing with patients. "A patient
must be treated as a whole
person," Young says. "There are
dimensions of personality that
don't fit into the test tube or
conform to laboratory values, and
these spiritual aspects are as
important as the physical ones."

"The lag between the advanced
state of technology and our
ability to handle it at the human
level indicates a pressing need for
ethical guidelines in biology and
medicine."
So says Dr. Ernie Young,
acting chaplain of the University
Hospital. He is teaching the
School of Medicine's first course
on biomedical ethics, this spring
quarter.
Young, who is also visiting
assistant dean of Stanford
Memorial Church, has been
associated with Hospitals in
Dallas, Tex. and in his native
Johannesburg, South Africa. It
was his suggestion to offer such a
course for Stanford medical
students.
The course, which meets
Wednesday evenings, includes
theory as well as specific
applications. "There seems to be a
need for an ethical framework
within which scientists and
physicians may base their
actions," explains Young. "The
theoretical portion will provide a
background that will help them in
making concrete decisions."
