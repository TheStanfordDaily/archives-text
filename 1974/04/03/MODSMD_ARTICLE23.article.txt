# Law, Med Programs Find Jobs
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
Members of Stanford-in-Law
and Stanford-in-Medicine, two
student-run organizations aimed
at providing students with legal
and medical experience, say
they're filling a neglected need in
the Stanford community. The
programs will lobby for jobs and
establish channels, although - the
individual student must still
contact and convince the
employer of his qualifications.
Both organizations, which are
located in the Old Firehouse,
share many of the same goals and
methods. Basically, they are
striving to offer the student
practical experience in law or
medicine in the form of
temporary full-time and part-time
employment, volunteer
experience or credit. They also
intend to educate and inform the
students as to what opportunities
and possibilities exist in each
field.
To apply, all a student need do
is fill out a form. An application
not only entitles one to potential
employment, but also to a place
in the program. After contacts
have been made, the student then
must persuade the employer he is
right for the job. Through both
programs, the student has the
advantage of being "approved" by
the University, since he is going
through University channels.
Placement And Counseling
John Bradley, director of
Stanford-in-Law, sums up the
program's purpose as placement
and counseling on campus, with
emphasis on exposing
undergraduates to different
aspects of legal careers and the
variety of careers available. He
plans to seek job opportunities in
the legal offices of large
corporations, with public
defenders, and maybe even within
the University. Bradley feels that
students already headed for a
career in law will seek out the
help of Stanford-in-Law, but he
hopes to reach those who haven't
made a career decision yet. He
stated that "first and second year

law students .. . and even some of
the others are going to want ...
to find a job in just a regular firm
that pays, but we are also going to
find the type of job that you may
not hear about in the context of
the legal profession."
To educate students, Bradley
plans to publicize relevant
courses, speakers, and information
to arouse interest in the field of
law. He foresees eventually
establishing a newsletter to
accomplish this.
Bradley said that first and
second year law students would
make up the greater part of the
Stanford-in-Law applicants ("Jobs
by their nature will be only
attractive to a handfull") but that
undergraduates who might be
interested in different aspects of
the legal profession as well as
alumni who might want to return
to school might apply.
Stanford-in-Medicine
Stanford-in-Law is more of a
pioneer in its efforts than
Stanford-in-Medicine, whose
objectives may be supported and
assisted by the Academic
Information Center and the
Pre-Med Society. Stanford-in-
Medicine is seeking to coordinate
its activities with these services for
improved intercommunication
and mutual support. Its main goal
is to make people aware of the
careers and opportunities
available, as well as to provide
first-hand experience.
Miguel Martinez, director of
Stanford-in-Medicine, feels that
with the growing competition in
the medical profession definite
goals (made through decisions
aided by working in the field) and
experience beyond education will
be advantageous to students
aiming for medical and
para-medical careers.
Martinez said that minority
students and medical students
would receive top priority in
efforts to secure positions. Besides
offering counseling for minorities,
he hopes to consolidate such

groups as the chicano pre-med
group and the black pre-med
group, "not to overlap but to
supplement them."
Leaders Optimistic
Leaders of both programs feel
optimistic and foresee great
progress. "I think there's a market
for it; we're not just creating
something," said John Wales, one
of the directors of
Stanford-in-Medicine.
The programs began last spring
when Pam Evans of the Placement
Center noticed an increase in

inquiries about and interest shown
in the medical and legal careers.
The programs were modeled after
Stanford-in-Government
(formerly Stanford-in-
Washington) and the existing
Business program. The idea was
presented to the Academic
Center, the Law Placement
Center, and the Dean of Student
Affairs Office for consultation. It
was then proposed to a group of
interested students, who have
steered and developed the
programs since.

programs, the student has the
advantage of being "approved" by
the University, since he is going
through University channels.
Placement And Counseling
John Bradley, director of
Stanford-in-Law, sums up the
program's purpose as placement
and counseling on campus, with
emphasis on exposing
undergraduates to different
aspects of legal careers and the
variety of careers available. He
plans to seek job opportunities in
the legal offices of large
corporations, with public
defenders, and maybe even within
the University. Bradley feels that
students already headed for a
career in law will seek out the
help of Stanford-in-Law, but he
hopes to reach those who haven't
made a career decision yet. He
stated that "first and second year

law students .. . and even some of
the others are going to want ...
to find a job in just a regular firm
that pays, but we are also going to
find the type of job that you may
not hear about in the context of
the legal profession."
To educate students, Bradley
plans to publicize relevant
courses, speakers, and information
to arouse interest in the field of
law. He foresees eventually
establishing a newsletter to
accomplish this.
Bradley said that first and
second year law students would
make up the greater part of the
Stanford-in-Law applicants ("Jobs
by their nature will be only
attractive to a handfull") but that
undergraduates who might be
interested in different aspects of
the legal profession as well as
alumni who might want to return
to school might apply.
Stanford-in-Medicine
Stanford-in-Law is more of a
pioneer in its efforts than
Stanford-in-Medicine, whose
objectives may be supported and
assisted by the Academic
Information Center and the
Pre-Med Society. Stanford-in-
Medicine is seeking to coordinate
its activities with these services for
improved intercommunication
and mutual support. Its main goal
is to make people aware of the
careers and opportunities
available, as well as to provide
first-hand experience.
Miguel Martinez, director of
Stanford-in-Medicine, feels that
with the growing competition in
the medical profession definite
goals (made through decisions
aided by working in the field) and
experience beyond education will
be advantageous to students
aiming for medical and
para-medical careers.
Martinez said that minority
students and medical students
would receive top priority in
efforts to secure positions. Besides
offering counseling for minorities,
he hopes to consolidate such

groups as the chicano pre-med
group and the black pre-med
group, "not to overlap but to
supplement them."
Leaders Optimistic
Leaders of both programs feel
optimistic and foresee great
progress. "I think there's a market
for it; we're not just creating
something," said John Wales, one
of the directors of
Stanford-in-Medicine.
The programs began last spring
when Pam Evans of the Placement
Center noticed an increase in

inquiries about and interest shown
in the medical and legal careers.
The programs were modeled after
Stanford-in-Government
(formerly Stanford-in-
Washington) and the existing
Business program. The idea was
presented to the Academic
Center, the Law Placement
Center, and the Dean of Student
Affairs Office for consultation. It
was then proposed to a group of
interested students, who have
steered and developed the
programs since.
Members of Stanford-in-Law
and Stanford-in-Medicine, two
student-run organizations aimed
at providing students with legal
and medical experience, say
they're filling a neglected need in
the Stanford community. The
programs will lobby for jobs and
establish channels, although - the
individual student must still
contact and convince the
employer of his qualifications.
Both organizations, which are
located in the Old Firehouse,
share many of the same goals and
methods. Basically, they are
striving to offer the student
practical experience in law or
medicine in the form of
temporary full-time and part-time
employment, volunteer
experience or credit. They also
intend to educate and inform the
students as to what opportunities
and possibilities exist in each
field.
To apply, all a student need do
is fill out a form. An application
not only entitles one to potential
employment, but also to a place
in the program. After contacts
have been made, the student then
must persuade the employer he is
right for the job. Through both
programs, the student has the
advantage of being "approved" by
the University, since he is going
