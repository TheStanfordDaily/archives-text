# Commercialism Deters Exhibits At Expo '74
## 
### 
SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -
Expo '74, billed as the World's
Environmental Fair, lacks a single
exhibit by a national conservation
group.
Some ecologists say the cost
would be prohibitive. Others cite
environmental reasons or
co mplain about its
commercialism.
Expo opens on May 4 with 11
nations, three states, two
Canadian provinces, eight
industries and the United States
Bureau of Reclamation among the
43 exhibitors.
Expo Theme
Exhibits will be built around
the theme: "Toward tomorrow's
fresh new environment." The fair,
sanctioned by the Bureau of
International Expositions, will be
held on a 100-acre site along the
Spokane River.

Spokesmen for Friends of the
Earth say they can't afford the
$75,000 Expo officials told them
an exhibit would cost. Space
alone, without interior work,
costs $20 a square foot, Expo
officials say.
"No environmental group can
come up with that kind of
money," said Friends' official
Natalie Roberts in San Francisco.
"There's a good reason why
the Sierra Club isn't exhibiting at
Expo," said Dr. Thatcher
Hubbard of the Spokane chapter.
"Most of the environmental
groups are opposed to Expo. We
call it ecophoney.
'Trade Fair'
"This is a trade fair put on by a
bunch of merchants to increase
profits. It's a commercial
enterprise and we abhor it,"he
said.
Expo General Manager Petr
Spurney said environmental
groups were welcome to exhibit,
"but we can't subsidize them."
