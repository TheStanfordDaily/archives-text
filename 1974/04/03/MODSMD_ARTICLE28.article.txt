# WSU Topples Cards, 8-0
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Stanford's bats, booming last
week at the Riverside Baseball
Tournament, were silenced
yesterday as Mark Beem pitched a
two-hitter in Washington State
University's 8-0 victory over the
Cardinals in Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinals were playing for
the first time since placing second
at Riverside. During that week
Stanford's hitters reached double
figures in nearly every game in the
hitting category and scored 14,11,
15 and 12 runs in four of the
games, recording a 5-3 tourney
mark.
However, the situation was
quite different yesterday. Dave
Baker and Kevin Sullivan were the
only Cards to hit safely. Sullivan
singled in the third and Baker
reached first in the fourth. From
then on Beem held the Cards in
check.
Washington State's scoring was
the result of a five-hit barrage in
the second inning that accounted
for seven runs off losing pitcher
Mike Williamson. Cougar first
baseman Marv Chamberlain
sparked the inning with a
360-foot grand slam home run to
left field. Chamberlain eventually
collected three hits for the game.
Chamberlain would never have
come to the plate in the fateful
inning if the Cards had executed a
force play successfully. But that
was not the case when the score
was 1-0 in favor of WSU and there
were two out Joe Lamoure
fielded a ground ball cleanly and
flipped to shortstop Steve Davis at
second base, however, the ball was

dropped, bringing up
Chamberlain.
With the seven-run cushion
Beem and WSU, favored to win
the Pacific Eight Northern
Division, seemed almost invincible
against Stanford. Beem's
performance is almost incredible
considering the fact that he was ill
Monday with a 104-degree
temperature.
The game originally scheduled
to begin at 2 p.m., did not begin
until 3 p.m. because of the
wetness of the field from rain.
After the gime.WSU (18-4) rushed
over to Santa Clara University for
a 7:30 p.m. game.
Stanford's leading hitter is
Baker, the MVP at the Riverside
tournament, with a .372 mark, 32

for 86.
Gary Bei leads the Cards in
runs with 19, while Bob Hampton
tops the runs batted in category
with 24. Mark Lucich and
Hampton are tied for the doubles
lead with five each. Joe Lamoure
has three triples and Lucich has
belted three home runs.
The Cards (10-15) play host to
defending Pac-8 champion
University of Southern California
in a three game series this
weekend. The first game is
scheduled for Friday at 2:30 p.m.
in Sunken Diamond. Saturday's
doubleheader is slated for 12
noon. USC leads the Southern
Division with a 3-0 mark after
sweeping a weekend series against
California.
