## Aaron's Burden 
### Don Tollefson 
In some ways I wish the start of the baseball season was one big
April Fool's joke. The prospect of seven long months and 162 games
isn't particularly appealing, especially when the NBA and NHL
playoffs are just beginning.
American society has raced by baseball in recent years and what
was once America's most popular sport has now become perhaps its
most senile. Increasing criticism has been met with innovations that
are about as useful as treating a terminally ill cancer patient with
Geritol.
One of the major issues of discussion in spring camps this year has
been the new balk lines on the pitching mound. Some baseball figures
make it sound like this is a revolutionary change which will bring
baseball out of the Dark Ages. The lines may be a good idea, but
they'll add about as muchexcitementas offering two kinds of mustard
with every hot dog.
The 1974 season doesn't open until tomorrow in Cincinnati, but it
looks as if the baseball community has already blown a golden
opportunity to reverse the trend towards steadily waning public
interest. It is understandable that such stupidity would happen in a
sport that has long since passed its prime, but nevertheless it is
unfortunate.
Tomorrow when the Atlanta Braves open the season in Cincinnati's
Riverfront Stadium, Henry Aaron will be only two home runs away
from achieving athletic immortality. It is disgraceful that the baseball
world has subjected this most deserving and modest man to an
extremely absurd series of events.
The moment Atlanta's season ended last October, Hank Aaron
began an off-season filled with incredible pressure. One need not be a
psychiatrist to realize the pressure inherent in being only two home
runs away from breaking the most famous sports record of all time.
Racist Attacks
It is hard to feel that we have made much progress in this society
when one considers the steady stream of hate mail Aaron repeatedly
has received ever since he began to close in on Babe Ruth's record of
714 career home runs. The cruelty of some of these racist attacks is
despicable and in this era of political terrorism, I am somewhat
surprised that Aaron was not victimized by some psychotic madman.
Given this unprecedented pressure Aaron has found himself under
for so many months, I find it absolutely incredible that the baseball
world to which he has contributed so much would make him an
innocent pawn in a senseless power struggle that was as unnecessary as
it was unfair to Aaron.
Even a non-sports fan could see the logic of having Atlanta open its
season with a home stand so that Aaron could break the record in
front of the Braves' fans. The logic becomes even more compelling
when one realizes what a number of full houses in Atlanta Stadium
could mean to the financially troubled Braves.
But logic appears to be irrelevant to baseball's hierarchy. So the
Braves are scheduled to play the Reds three times in Cincinnati
before they open at home and one didn't need to be a seer to predict
how the Atlanta management would react to this proclamation.
The Braves countered by announcing that Aaron would sit out the
Cincinnati series. Then the infamous Bowie Kuhn entered the scene.
After straddling the fence ad museum, Kuhn finally ordered the
Braves to play Aaron in the Cincinnati series.
Kuhn Criticized
We will not know whether the Braves will defy Kuhn's order until
tomorrow, but if they do, don't be surprised at anything Kuhn might
do in retaliation. Forcing Aaron to bat with a 22" bat or with his eyes
closed would not be out of character for an imbecile like Kuhn.
It is somehow fitting that the archaic world of baseball would
subject a black man to such unnecessary and unfair additional
pressure. Many blacks have gained a lot from baseball, but many more
never got the chance.
And even today, over 25 years after Jackie Robinson broke
through the barrier of hatred and racism, the color line remains in the
managerial area. There are still no black managers today although
ex-players including Maury Wills, Frank Robinson and Bill White are
certainly more qualified than many current major league managers.

But all the racism in the world
won't stop Hank Aaron from
becoming the greatest home run
hitter in baseball history. For
Aaron's sake, I hope No. 715
comes quickly and when it does, I
for one will be feeling incredible
respect for a black man who
overcame all the obstacles he
faced. And at that moment, those
owners who have unjustly
prevented blacks from becoming
major league managers, will
hopefully feel some guilt.
It's about time they did.
