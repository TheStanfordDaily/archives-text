# Lyman: Frenchman's Terrace In Jeopardy

President Lyman said last night that
the Frenchman's Terrace housing
project "is in real jeopardy" in light of
the suit filed Monday by the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP).
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said he viewed the
suit "with considerable dismay" and
couldn't understand "what would
motivate an approach like this at such
a late date."
The NAACP has said that the
project is a luxury housing project and
not the low to moderate income
residence that it is supposed to be.
Lyman said the project "was always
intended to be a moderate income
development" and that it was
"nonsense to say this project is failing
to help low income people."
"It seemed a venturesome and
constructive approach for a problem
that is widespread . . . and was viewed
with enthusiasm by the Housing and
Urban Development," he said.
Criticism
"We've been working on it for six
long years. This thing's been shot at,
attacked, criticized and adversely
affected by a variety of different
groups representing various

viewpoints. It is a classic case in how
difficult it is to get something done in
solution (to a social problem),"
Lyman said with some irritation.
"I do think the project is in some
jeopardy. I don't know many more
attacks this project can undergo
without disappearing.
Lyman added, "I think it needs
support and it has had precious little
support from people who in other
circumstances can profess to be very
interested in solving social problems."
Lyman said the suit was "a bolt
from the blue" and that no course of
action had yet been formulated.
"I can't see where there is much
legal basis to this (suit) but that
doesn't mean (it will be easy to deal
with)," he said.
Black Theme Houses
In response to another question,
Lyman said that the Dean of Student
Affairs was looking into the
establishment of two 50 percent black
theme houses in Lagunita and that the
issue was "still under intense
discussion."
The move of the theme house from
Roble to Lagunita came under
consideration after students had come
to the administration with a proposal

project is "in jeopardy" because of an NAACP lawsuit.
for a new theme house.
Speaking about theme houses in
general, Lyman said that the
experience with them has been
"mixed."
Lyman said caution must be used
to that a theme house "doesn't
become a completely separate enclave.
The group can't have everything its
own way,. . . and this is where friction
comes up."
Professoriate Report
Lyman also said that the Report on
the Professoriate recently submitted to
the Faculty Senate was "a very
constructive effort" and that their
recommendations against establishing
a rolling tenure policy "makes a great
deal of sense."
Lyman expressed some uncertainty
as to the value of student evaluations
in the tenure decision process. "There
are some aspects (of a professor's
ability) that can't be adequately
judged by students," he said.
Commenting on other subjects,
Lyman said he thought the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union was
being unreasonable in their
negotiations and that he could not
understand why the union suspended
negotiations.
With regard to a possible strike,
Lyman said "It's premature to get in
any swivet"
