# Fencers 30th At NCAA's
## 
### 
Two senior fencers, Phil
Michael and Ethan Merritt,
represented Stanford last week at
the NCAA Fencing
Championships at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland,
Ohio.
Both Michael in epee and
Merritt in foil finished sixth in
their preliminary pools Thursday,
and had to fence in a special
round to qualify to the finals.
Michael survived and made the
finals, but Merritt was eliminated.
According to Coach Jean
Helliwell, "with one more touch
in one bout he would have gone
up."
In the epee final, held Friday
and Saturday, Michael finished
19th among 24 fencers, with a
record of 8-15.
Michael's showing in the finals
and Merritt's wins in the
preliminaries gave Stanford 30th
place in the team competition,
without benefit of an entry in the
sabre event.
