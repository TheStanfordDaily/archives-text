# Murphy To Direct Shrine Game
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Sports Information Director
Bob Murphy, a part-time radio
and television announcer when he
isn't promoting Stanford sports,
has accepted yet another
responsibility for at least the next
three years.
Murphy has been appointed
Executive Director of the East vs.
West Shrine Game, it was
announced last week by Thomas
J. Lawson, Potentate of Islam
Temple.
"This is probably the most
flattering thing that has ever
happened to me," said Murphy.
"For the next three years I will be
dedicated toward the absolute and
total success of every Shrine
game, and I hope that everyone in
the Bay Area will take pride in
this great classic, plan to attend,
and in that way to further one of
the most rewarding traditions in
our local heritage."
Since 1925 the Shrine game
has raised more than $7 million
for the Shriner's Hospital for
crippled children, and over 2,000
college football players and
almost a hundred coaches have
participated. But in recent years
the game has failed to attract large
crowds, due in part, Murphy feels,
to the "competitive market" of
Bay Area sports.
Marked Contrast
Murphy pointed out the
"marked contrast" between the
San Francisco 49ers, who attract
sellout crowds game after game,
and the Shrine Classic, which is

usually played before only
half-capacity audiences.
In 1969 the East-West game
was played at Stanford, and the
crowd of 70,000 was the largest in
the history of the contest. "I've
been very close to the game," said
Murphy, who worked as a water
boy at the game as a teenager.
In 1970 and 1971 he teamed
with Tom Harmon and Duffy
Daugherty, among others, to
broadcast the Shrine classic.
"There is more competition
than ever before for the sports
dollar," Lawson explained, "and
we feel that someone with Bob's
capability will assist us in
developing even more net income

than in previous years, so that we,
in turn, can do more to heal and
rehabilitate crippled children. We
are asking a professional to give us
some administrative direction, and
certainly this young man is one of
the more popular sports
personalities in the Bay Area."
New Ideas
Murphy has several new ideas
for next year's game, and
"believes that better exposure for
the players" is important. He
plans to keep the teams in the city
and "closer to the media," and
will encourage public attendance
at the all stars' practices. Practice
sessions will be held at different

locations to further exposure and
public interest. In addition, clinics
for children will be held.
Murphy feels that his position
as Executive Director will
"complement my other duties"
rather than interfere with his
responsibilities as Sports
Information Director.
A former pitcher for the
Stanford baseball team and the
Oakland Oaks, Murphy came to
Stanford in 1964 as Manager of
Athletic relations under Chuck
Taylor. In that time, season ticket
sales have more than doubled.
Murphy will assume his
responsibilities immediately.

flattering thing that has ever
happened to me," said Murphy.
"For the next three years I will be
dedicated toward the absolute and
total success of every Shrine
game, and I hope that everyone in
the Bay Area will take pride in
this great classic, plan to attend,
and in that way to further one of
the most rewarding traditions in
our local heritage."
Since 1925 the Shrine game
has raised more than $7 million
for the Shriner's Hospital for
crippled children, and over 2,000
college football players and
almost a hundred coaches have
participated. But in recent years
the game has failed to attract large
crowds, due in part, Murphy feels,
to the "competitive market" of
Bay Area sports.
Marked Contrast
Murphy pointed out the
"marked contrast" between the
San Francisco 49ers, who attract
sellout crowds game after game,
and the Shrine Classic, which is

usually played before only
half-capacity audiences.
In 1969 the East-West game
was played at Stanford, and the
crowd of 70,000 was the largest in
the history of the contest. "I've
been very close to the game," said
Murphy, who worked as a water
boy at the game as a teenager.
In 1970 and 1971 he teamed
with Tom Harmon and Duffy
Daugherty, among others, to
broadcast the Shrine classic.
"There is more competition
than ever before for the sports
dollar," Lawson explained, "and
we feel that someone with Bob's
capability will assist us in
developing even more net income

than in previous years, so that we,
in turn, can do more to heal and
rehabilitate crippled children. We
are asking a professional to give us
some administrative direction, and
certainly this young man is one of
the more popular sports
personalities in the Bay Area."
New Ideas
Murphy has several new ideas
for next year's game, and
"believes that better exposure for
the players" is important. He
plans to keep the teams in the city
and "closer to the media," and
will encourage public attendance
at the all stars' practices. Practice
sessions will be held at different

locations to further exposure and
public interest. In addition, clinics
for children will be held.
Murphy feels that his position
as Executive Director will
"complement my other duties"
rather than interfere with his
responsibilities as Sports
Information Director.
A former pitcher for the
Stanford baseball team and the
Oakland Oaks, Murphy came to
Stanford in 1964 as Manager of
Athletic relations under Chuck
Taylor. In that time, season ticket
sales have more than doubled.
Murphy will assume his
responsibilities immediately.
Sports Information Director
Bob Murphy, a part-time radio
and television announcer when he
isn't promoting Stanford sports,
has accepted yet another
responsibility for at least the next
three years.
Murphy has been appointed
Executive Director of the East vs.
West Shrine Game, it was
announced last week by Thomas
J. Lawson, Potentate of Islam
Temple.
"This is probably the most
flattering thing that has ever
happened to me," said Murphy.
"For the next three years I will be
dedicated toward the absolute and
