# Gymnasts Enter NCAA's, Hug Tries For Third Title
## 
### 
Five members of the Stanford
gymnastics team, who are
probably most quickly identified
as Steve Hug and the four
pre-meds, will participate in the
NCAA championships tomorrow
through Saturday at Penn State
University.
For Hug, a photography major,
it'll be a chance to cap a brilliant

career with the Cards. He has won
the NCAA all-around for the past
two years (tying for first last
year), and & third victory in this,
his senior season, will only
solidify the two-time Olympians'
position as one of the best men's
gymnasts in the country.
For the other members of
Coach Sadao Hamada's squad, the

NCAA's will offer a chance to
carve niches of their own in
individual events.
Sophomore Ted Marcy is
hoping to improve last year's
fourth place finish in the
sidehorse. A two-time Pacific
Eight champion in the event,
Marcy has recorded the best
individual mark of any Stanford
gymnast this year, with a 9.65
score.
Senior Howard Bessen, a
specialist on the rings, will try to
close his career by improving on
last year's sixth place NCAA
finish. Bessen has spent the last
several weeks working on an
entirely new routine for the
optionals.
Like Bessen, senior vaulter
Shawn Skerrett hopes to close his
college career with something
new. He's been working on a IV2
twist vault he hopes will catapult
him well beyond his 15th place
finish at last year's national meet.
Junior Bob Anderson, along
with Bessen and Skerrett, finished
second in his sepcialty — floor
exercise — at last month's Pac-B's.
He didn't participate in last year's
NCAA meet, but has a fine season
best of 9.3.
Stanford finished the 1974
regular season with a
disappointing 1-4 mark, largely
due to tough competition and
lack of strength at the two events
in which the team didn't place a
man in the NCAA's — the parallel
bars and high bar.
However, the Cards recovered
successfully enough to place third,
behind California and Oregon, at
the Pac-8 meet at Eugene, and
Hamada hopes the improvement
shown by all members of the
squad this year will continue at
the NCAA's.
