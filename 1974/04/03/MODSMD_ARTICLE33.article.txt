# Tennis Team Ready For First Tests
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The recent deluges have
miraculously escaped the Stanford
tennis team, and it appears it'll be
ready to play when it goes down
to Los Angeles to face UCLA and
USC this Friday and Saturday.
With the exception of
registration day, the Cardinals
have practiced every day
outdoors. However, showers last
Wednesday and Thursday gave the
team members their first chance
to play on Stanford's Sport Face
carpet in Maples Pavilion.
The carpet was laid down for
testing prior to the April 19-20
matches against USC and UCLA,
when it'll get its official debut in
evening matches at Maples.
"The carpet's worked out
really well. It fits into Maples
perfectly, the lights there are
good, the bounces are good,
though it's not like playing
outdoors," coach Dick Gould
said.

So, the team members have
been preparing for the L.A.
matches by playing what may be
the toughest competition of the
season â€” challenge matches for
spots on the Stanford ladder.
Gould isn't ready to announce
his lineup for the weekend,
pending final matches which are
being played yesterday and today.
But it's reasonably certain that
the top three slots will be filled by
Sandy Mayer, Jim Delaney and
John Whitlinger, in that order.
Gould's tradition is to let the
players decide, through matches,
the order for the first set of
matches against UCLA and USC
matches. The coach then makes
switches as he sees fit before the
second set of matches.
Only three Stanford players
participated in outside
tournaments during spring break.
Mayer finished his successful tour
on the United States Lawn Tennis
Federation winter circuit with an

early-round loss in Tempe,
Arizona. Despite this, Mayer
finished second behind only
Jimmy Connors in the USLTA
tour's point standings. He's just
returned to campus for his final
quarter.
Nick Saviano and Tim Noonan
both played in the Modesto Open,
one of the most important of the
Northern California series of
tourneys. Saviano reached the

semis before bowing to former
USC star Mike Machette, while
Noonan reached the finals before
losing to Machette.
The team will be in reasonably
good health entering the Los
Angeles matches. However, Chip
Fisher has been bothered by a
sprained ankle while Mark
Mitchell had problems with his
knees in a challenge loss to
Saviano.
