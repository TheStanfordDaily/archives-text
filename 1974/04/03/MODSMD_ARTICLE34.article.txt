# Shuffling The Cards
## Basketball Writers' Elitism 
### Dave Robinson 
Just when North Carolina State ended one era of
college basketball elitism — UCLA's eight-year reign
as NCAA champions — a couple of sportswriters
decided to exhibit some literary elitism of their
own.
"Marquette," wrote Los Angeles Times
syndicated columnist Jim Murray, "is this kind of
team: It fights with the coach, it makes up plays on
its own, it takes the flashy low percentage shot
when the spirit moves it. They wear their shirts
outside their pants, they shave only if they feel like
it. You half-expected them to come on the court
smoking. They manage to look on the floor as if
they were hanging around a pool hall.
"Their coach is an ex-bartender who rules his
brood by shouting and threatening. It's not a team,
it's a revolution. It's a wonder they wear the same
color uniform.
"A 1 McGuire is a coach who never knows if his
first string center will drop off the team bus on the
way to a game to join the Seattle Super-sonics — or
the Navy. The discipline is roughly that of a street
gang "
Positive Revolution
It's true that Marquette's players will never be
mistaken for a group of altar boys. The Warriors are
indeed flashy, but the "revolution" is hardly
negative. A 1 McGuire, one of the most outspoken,
wittiest and energetic coaches on the college
basketball scene, apparently is guilty of an
inexcusable coaching crime — allowing his players
to be individuals.
Murray's colorfully worded criticisms can't hide
the fact that McGuire's tactics have been successful.
Marquette has won at least 20 games 10 years in a
row. The 1974 Warriors — the same team chastised
by Murray as a "street gang" — were certainly one
of the top five squads in the nation. Marquette
looked a bit disorganized in the title game only
because it was up against a brilliant opponent in
North Carolina State.
But Murray decided that the reason for the
Wolfpack's superiority wasn't wondrous David
Thompson, or functional giant Tom Burleson, or
feisty Monte Towe, or underrated contributors Tim
Stoddard and Moe Rivers.
Instead, he praised State as "a team in an old
mold. The coach is one of those worried-looking,
lip-biting types who wants a parade-ground type of
efficiency.

Pine Tree Origins
"Norman Sloan never wiped a bar or slept in a
fire escape, and his team comes from pine trees, not
playgrounds. They all got their hair cut and they
wear the school colors on trips and say 'Sir' and call
the coach 'Coach' and never 'Al' or something
worse."
Sloan's background is certainly honorable, but
McGuire shouldn't be permanently condemned for
tending bar. And in case Murray's memory is
faulty, he should be reminded that playgrounds
produce considerably more basketball talent than
pine trees. Remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Connie Hawkins, Walt Frazier and Spencer
Haywood, to name a few? And in my view at least,
the only NCAA participants deserving the title
"Sir" were Thompson and Bill Walton.
Meanwhile, the North American Newspaper
Alliance was guilty of similar elitist logic. "The best
way to examine Thompson," the news service said
in a syndicated article, "is to place him beside
Walton. They are as different as the color of their
skin. They are players who became the symbols of
their teams."
'Impeach The President'
The article went on to chastise Walton for
answering this phone with the words "Impeach the
President," wearing faded blue jeans to an awards
banquet and being arrested in an anti-war
demonstration. Thompson, meanwhile, pursues
causes "less generalized . . . Instead of meditation,
Thompson leans toward old-time religion. Instead
of refusing to participate on teams representing the
United States, Thompson says the chance to play in
the World Games 'still makes me proud.' "
The article also criticized Walton for refusing to
talk to a group of wide-eyed and annoying
reporters after the game. "His image remained
intact until the end. He was UCLA's arrogance of
power while Thompson was State's gracious
champion."
More accurately, both are intense individuals
who have contributed immeasurably to college
basketball. Both are champions. The North
American Newspaper Alliance failed in its obvious
attempt to appear liberal by praising a black player
while criticizing a white.
North Carolina State's impressive championship
signalled a new competitive era of college
basketball. Hopefully, the words of Murray and the
Newspaper Alliance won't halt the game's progress.

the Navy. The discipline is roughly that of a street
gang "
Positive Revolution
It's true that Marquette's players will never be
mistaken for a group of altar boys. The Warriors are
indeed flashy, but the "revolution" is hardly
negative. A 1 McGuire, one of the most outspoken,
wittiest and energetic coaches on the college
basketball scene, apparently is guilty of an
inexcusable coaching crime — allowing his players
to be individuals.
Murray's colorfully worded criticisms can't hide
the fact that McGuire's tactics have been successful.
Marquette has won at least 20 games 10 years in a
row. The 1974 Warriors — the same team chastised
by Murray as a "street gang" — were certainly one
of the top five squads in the nation. Marquette
looked a bit disorganized in the title game only
because it was up against a brilliant opponent in
North Carolina State.
But Murray decided that the reason for the
Wolfpack's superiority wasn't wondrous David
Thompson, or functional giant Tom Burleson, or
feisty Monte Towe, or underrated contributors Tim
Stoddard and Moe Rivers.
Instead, he praised State as "a team in an old
mold. The coach is one of those worried-looking,
lip-biting types who wants a parade-ground type of
efficiency.

Pine Tree Origins
"Norman Sloan never wiped a bar or slept in a
fire escape, and his team comes from pine trees, not
playgrounds. They all got their hair cut and they
wear the school colors on trips and say 'Sir' and call
the coach 'Coach' and never 'Al' or something
worse."
Sloan's background is certainly honorable, but
McGuire shouldn't be permanently condemned for
tending bar. And in case Murray's memory is
faulty, he should be reminded that playgrounds
produce considerably more basketball talent than
pine trees. Remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Connie Hawkins, Walt Frazier and Spencer
Haywood, to name a few? And in my view at least,
the only NCAA participants deserving the title
"Sir" were Thompson and Bill Walton.
Meanwhile, the North American Newspaper
Alliance was guilty of similar elitist logic. "The best
way to examine Thompson," the news service said
in a syndicated article, "is to place him beside
Walton. They are as different as the color of their
skin. They are players who became the symbols of
their teams."
'Impeach The President'
The article went on to chastise Walton for
answering this phone with the words "Impeach the
President," wearing faded blue jeans to an awards
banquet and being arrested in an anti-war
demonstration. Thompson, meanwhile, pursues
causes "less generalized . . . Instead of meditation,
Thompson leans toward old-time religion. Instead
of refusing to participate on teams representing the
United States, Thompson says the chance to play in
the World Games 'still makes me proud.' "
The article also criticized Walton for refusing to
talk to a group of wide-eyed and annoying
reporters after the game. "His image remained
intact until the end. He was UCLA's arrogance of
power while Thompson was State's gracious
champion."
More accurately, both are intense individuals
who have contributed immeasurably to college
basketball. Both are champions. The North
American Newspaper Alliance failed in its obvious
attempt to appear liberal by praising a black player
while criticizing a white.
North Carolina State's impressive championship
signalled a new competitive era of college
basketball. Hopefully, the words of Murray and the
Newspaper Alliance won't halt the game's progress.
Just when North Carolina State ended one era of
college basketball elitism — UCLA's eight-year reign
as NCAA champions — a couple of sportswriters
decided to exhibit some literary elitism of their
own.
"Marquette," wrote Los Angeles Times
syndicated columnist Jim Murray, "is this kind of
team: It fights with the coach, it makes up plays on
its own, it takes the flashy low percentage shot
when the spirit moves it. They wear their shirts
outside their pants, they shave only if they feel like
it. You half-expected them to come on the court
smoking. They manage to look on the floor as if
they were hanging around a pool hall.
"Their coach is an ex-bartender who rules his
brood by shouting and threatening. It's not a team,
it's a revolution. It's a wonder they wear the same
color uniform.

first string center will drop off the team bus on the
way to a game to join the Seattle Super-sonics — or
