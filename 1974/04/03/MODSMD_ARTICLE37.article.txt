Chapin Trial Begins
WASHINGTON — Dwight L. Chapin was kept
informed about fake political literature that Donald H.
Segretti distributed, witnesses testified yesterday.
Segretti, the opening witness in Chapin's perjury trial,
said he sent samples of his phony news releases,
embarrassing questionnaires, and wrongly credited posters
to Chapin at his home.
Herbert W. Kalmbach, once President Nixon's personal
lawyer, testified he told Chapin about the meeting where he
and Segretti agreed on a salary of $16,000 a year plus
expenses "either that day or a day or two later."
The money came from 1968 Nixon election campaign
funds held by Kalmbach.
Their testimony went to the heart of the government's
charges against Chapin — that he lied to a federal grand jury
that he didn't know Segretti distributed any campaign
literature and didn't know what Segretti was paid.
Chapin, once President Nixon's appointments secretary,
also is charged with lying under oath that he advised
Segretti to talk with the FBI and thpt he never told the
young California lawyer which Democratic candidates
should be his target.
Donald Nixon Denies Veseo Tie-In
NEW YORK — Donald Nixon testified yesterday
that he rebuffed an effort by a Robert L. Vesco aide to get
a message to his brother, President Nixon, but did suggest
that "John Mitchell might be the man to talk to."
"I said there was no way I could do this," the tall, portly
Nixon said. "It has been my policy ever since my brother
has been in politics. I have never taken anything directly to
him. For anyone I ever worked for.
"John Mitchell was the man designated — I never talked
to my brother on any matter and John Mitchell was the
man I was designated to talk to," Nixon testified at another
point.
President Nixon once said he had Donald Nixon's
telephone tapped for security reasons — to protect his
brother from people who might try to use him because of
his relationship to the President.
Donald Nixon testified for the government at the
criminal conspiracy trial of Mitchell, the one time attorney
general, and former Commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans.
Laos Forms Coalition Government
VIENTIANE, Laos — Premier Prince Souvanna
Phouma and the Communist led Pathet Lao agreed
yesterday to form a coalition government. It came 12 years
after the last such regime in Laos collapsed in bitter
fighting.
Pathet Lao secretary-general Phoumi Vongvichit
announced the agreement following a 70-minute meeting
with Souvanna Phouma. The two had been conferring
almost daily since Phoumi arrived in Vientiane a week ago
for the final negotiations on a coalition.

Phoumi said the Pathet Lao leader, Prince
Souphanouvong, who is a half-brother of Souvanna
Phouma, will arrive in Vientiane today. The two princes
were scheduled to travel together tomorrow 200 miles to
the north to the royal capital at Luang Prabang where their
coalition government was to be ritually endorsed by the
king.
Souphanouvong was reportedly to serve as one of two
deputy premiers under Souvanna Phouma, just as he did in
the last joint government.
The coalition will be the third for Laos since the country
gained its freedom from France. The first, in 1957, lasted
five months.
Agnew Fights Disbarment
ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Attorneys for Spiro T. Agnew told
the Maryland Court of Appeals yesterday that the former
vice president's high position and "public outcry" should
not affect a decision on whether Agnew should be
disbarred.
The attorneys said Agnew, who resigned the vice
presidency and pleaded no contest last year to evading
about $13,500 in federal taxes in 1967 when he was
governor of Maryland, should only be suspended from
practicing law and not disbarred.
Agnew is appealing a unanimous recommendation of a
three-judge Circuit Court panel that he be disbarred.
Disbarment proceedings were brought against Agnew by
the Maryland Bar Association last year after he was
convicted of income tax evasion in United States District
Court in Baltimore. He was fined $10,000 and placed on
three years' probation.
