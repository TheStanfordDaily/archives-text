# Office Of Admissions Accepts Class Of '78
## 
### 
The Admissions Office mailed
acceptances to prospective freshmen
15 days earlier than usualâ€” April
Fool's Day.
And the letters were no joke,
according to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, who intentionally avoided
dating the letters April 1.
Acceptances were mailed early for
the convenience of applicants, who
must reply to the University's
invitation by May 1. By gentleman's
agreement, most universities require
responses by that date.
The assumption on the part of the
Admissions Office is that many
students admitted here will also be

accepted elsewhere. "They'll have to
make a tough choice," said Robert
Hamrdla, assistant dean of
undergraduate studies.
In the past, students haven't had
enough time "to develop a rationale
for their choice," Hargadon said. Due
to postal delays, especially for letters
destined for abroad, many students
have had "only a couple of days to
make up their minds," he said.
Hargadon denied that the school
from which a student receives his first
acceptance will be the one he
eventually attends.
Some students who are told early
that they ave been admitted here
may wish to visit the campus during
their spring vacation. Over 400
students visited the campus last year,
Hargadon estimated, and the number
seems to increase each year.
This year the Office of Admissions
included a time schedule of classes
with each letter of acceptance in case
the student plans to visit the campus.
The early mailing did not strain the
staff of the Admissions Office
inordinately. "It just meant more
nights for us earlier in the year,"
Hargadon said. "We've got as good a
group as they come," he ventured,
"although this is purely impressionistic
and based on my intuition." The hard
date on the class of 1978 will come
later, he promised.
