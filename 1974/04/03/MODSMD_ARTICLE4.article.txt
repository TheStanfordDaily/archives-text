# Frenchman's Terrace
## NAACP Files Housing Suit 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A suit filed Monday in federal court
challenging the legality of the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project charges that the
complex would be too expensive to
benefit the poor people it is designed
to help.
The action, filed by the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP), terms the
project a "luxury housing project,"
according to Nathaniel Colley, western
regional counsel for the NAACP.
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225 unit project for low and moderate
income residents of the Palo Alto area,
would be built on Stanford land, but
would be financed with federal funds,
and managed by the Urban Coalition.
Named as defendants in the
NAACP suit were Stanford University,
U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) James T. Lynn,
HUD area director James H. Price, and
the Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition.
Federal Funds
Colley claimed that the project
would violate the national Housing
Act, which provides that federal funds
should be used only for low income
housing developments.
Only 20 percent of the units in
Frenchman's Terrace would be
earmarked for low income people, he

pointed out. Forty percent would be
set aside for people of moderate
incomes whose rents and mortgages
would be subsidized and 40 percent
would be reserved for people who
could pay the full market price for
their housing.
Colley said hundreds of projects
that would benefit the poor have been
denied funds by the federal
government, notably the proposed
Hunter's Point project in San
Francisco.
Trustee Disagrees
"Frenchman's Terrace would take
money away from projects that should
be helping the poor," Colley said.
"Federal subsidies were never intended
for programs such as Frenchman's
Terrace."
Ira Hall, executive director of the
Midpeninsula Urban Coalition and
Stanford trustee, disagreed with Colley,
asserting that the project would help
large numbers of poor people. Some
units would cost a single person as
little as $37 a month, he said. A family
of four could obtain a unit for $68 a
month.
Colley claimed that it is important
to test the legality of Frenchman's
Terrace.
Legal Issue
"It would be a dereliction of duty
not to challenge the project," he said.
"Stanford should be glad that the

legality of the project will have a
chance to be tested in court. If it is
illegal then the University will be
spared from breaking the law, and if it
is proven to be legal, then Stanford has
nothing to fear anyway."
Hall insisted however that the
project is legal, and that lengthy court
proceedings would delay the
construction of what he termed a
socially worthwhile project. Such a
delay would only serve to increase the
cost of the complex, Hall explained,
causing rents to be higher than they
would be if Frenchman's Terrace were
built today.
James Siena, University counsel,
agreed with Hall that there is no
question the Frenchman's Terrace
project is legal. He pointed out that
the federal government provided funds
(or the project only after careful
investigation of its legality.
'At A Loss'
Hall said that if the NAACP had
investigated the legal facts concerning
Frenchman's Terrace it might have
decided not to file the suit.
"I am simply at a total loss to
understand why this suit was filed. A
simple telephone call to my office by
the officials of the NAACP might well
have prevented the lawsuit."
Alan Maremont, executive director
of the Midpeninsula Housing
Corporation of the Urban Coalition,
said the action of the NAACP
dismayed him. "We don't understand
why "the NAACP would oppose
Frenchman's Terrace," he said.
Both Hall and Maremont agreed
that there is considerable need for low
income housing and expressed
displeasure with the scarcity of
government funds for projects to help
the disadvantaged. But they stated the
solution to the problem cannot lie in
depriving one project of funds to aid
another project.
Hall said that William White,
director of the Palo Alto and Stanford
branch of the NAACP, does not agree
with the decision to file the suit. He
added that numerous other branches
of the NAACP oppose the suit.
Hall and Maremont pointed out
that the Urban Coalition and HUD
have often worked harmoniously with
the NAACP in the past to eliminate
housing discrimination. This fact
makes the current dispute especially
unfortunate, they noted.

TERRACE PROBLEMS—Ira Hall, executive director of the Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, listens to speakers at the Oct 24, 1972 Palo Alto City Council open
hearing on the Frenchman's Terrace project.
A suit filed Monday in federal court
challenging the legality of the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project charges that the
complex would be too expensive to
benefit the poor people it is designed
to help.
The action, filed by the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP), terms the
project a "luxury housing project,"
according to Nathaniel Colley, western
regional counsel for the NAACP.
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225 unit project for low and moderate
income residents of the Palo Alto area,
would be built on Stanford land, but
would be financed with federal funds,
and managed by the Urban Coalition.
Named as defendants in the
NAACP suit were Stanford University,
U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) James T. Lynn,
HUD area director James H. Price, and
the Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition.
Federal Funds
Colley claimed that the project
would violate the national Housing
Act, which provides that federal funds
should be used only for low income
housing developments.
Only 20 percent of the units in
Frenchman's Terrace would be
earmarked for low income people, he

pointed out. Forty percent would be
set aside for people of moderate
incomes whose rents and mortgages
would be subsidized and 40 percent
would be reserved for people who
could pay the full market price for
their housing.
Colley said hundreds of projects
that would benefit the poor have been
denied funds by the federal
government, notably the proposed
Hunter's Point project in San
Francisco.
Trustee Disagrees
"Frenchman's Terrace would take
money away from projects that should
be helping the poor," Colley said.
"Federal subsidies were never intended
for programs such as Frenchman's
Terrace."
Ira Hall, executive director of the
Midpeninsula Urban Coalition and
Stanford trustee, disagreed with Colley,
asserting that the project would help
large numbers of poor people. Some
units would cost a single person as
little as $37 a month, he said. A family
of four could obtain a unit for $68 a
month.
Colley claimed that it is important
to test the legality of Frenchman's
Terrace.
Legal Issue
"It would be a dereliction of duty
not to challenge the project," he said.
"Stanford should be glad that the

legality of the project will have a
chance to be tested in court. If it is
illegal then the University will be
spared from breaking the law, and if it
is proven to be legal, then Stanford has
nothing to fear anyway."
Hall insisted however that the
project is legal, and that lengthy court
proceedings would delay the
construction of what he termed a
socially worthwhile project. Such a
delay would only serve to increase the
cost of the complex, Hall explained,
causing rents to be higher than they
would be if Frenchman's Terrace were
built today.
James Siena, University counsel,
agreed with Hall that there is no
question the Frenchman's Terrace
project is legal. He pointed out that
the federal government provided funds
(or the project only after careful
investigation of its legality.
'At A Loss'
Hall said that if the NAACP had
investigated the legal facts concerning
Frenchman's Terrace it might have
decided not to file the suit.
"I am simply at a total loss to
understand why this suit was filed. A
simple telephone call to my office by
the officials of the NAACP might well
have prevented the lawsuit."
Alan Maremont, executive director
of the Midpeninsula Housing
Corporation of the Urban Coalition,
said the action of the NAACP
dismayed him. "We don't understand
why "the NAACP would oppose
Frenchman's Terrace," he said.
Both Hall and Maremont agreed
that there is considerable need for low
income housing and expressed
displeasure with the scarcity of
government funds for projects to help
the disadvantaged. But they stated the
solution to the problem cannot lie in
depriving one project of funds to aid
another project.
Hall said that William White,
director of the Palo Alto and Stanford
branch of the NAACP, does not agree
with the decision to file the suit. He
added that numerous other branches
of the NAACP oppose the suit.
Hall and Maremont pointed out
that the Urban Coalition and HUD
have often worked harmoniously with
the NAACP in the past to eliminate
housing discrimination. This fact
makes the current dispute especially
unfortunate, they noted.

with the decision to file the suit. He

the NAACP in the past to eliminate
housing discrimination. This fact
makes the current dispute especially
unfortunate, they noted.
