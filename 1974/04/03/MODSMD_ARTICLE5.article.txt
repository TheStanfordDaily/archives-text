# Word Due Soon On Hearst Release
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
exact time and place of Patricia
Hearst's release will be disclosed
within 72 hours, a communique
bearing the signature of the
Syinbionese Liberation Army said
yesterday.
The communique contained half of
a driver's license with the signature
"Patricia Hearst." The state
Department of Motor Vehicles said in
Sacramento that details on the portion
match details on its records of Miss
Hearst's license-including the initials of
the clerk who processed and issued the
license.
The communique, wrapped in a
dozen long-stemmed red roses, was
delivered to the bi-weekly
underground newspaper, the Phoenix,
yesterday by a florist. It arrived 17
hours late because the florist's car
broke down.
The florist said a smartly dressed
young woman who ordered the dozen
red roses "asked me to deliver it as
soon as possible. I said I would deliver
it by six o'clock and she said okay."
"She gave me a gib white envelope
and asked me to put it inside," the
florist said. The envelope contained
"Communique No. 7" from the
Symbionese Liberation Army, which
kidnaped Miss Hearst Feb. 4.
Car Wouldn't Start
But the florist said her car wouldn't
start. So she waited until the next
morning and had a flower delivery
company take the roses to the
underground Phoenix newspaper.
The florist said her mysterious
customer paid $2.99 for the roses and
$1.50 delivery charge in cash.
The florist said the apparent SLA
courier "looked to me like medium
height, not too tall, not too short. She
wore a short dress and jacket, a
two-piece thing, dark color."
The communique does not make
clear when the 72 hour countdown
began.
Father's Response
"If it's true we're delighted," said a
statement released by Randolph A.
Hearst, Miss Hearst's father. "It sounds
like their SLA communique. I wish to

believe it."
There was no way to confirm that
the communique was authentic, but it
followed the pattern and style of
previous communications which
authorities have accepted as coming
from the SLA.
The communique concluded:
"Further communications regarding
subject will follow in the following 72
hours, communications will state the
state, city and time of release of the
prisoner."
"Codes Of War"
It demanded that the "Codes of
War" of the SLA, which were
enclosed, be printed by the news
media.
The communique was addressed to
Phoenix editor John Bryan and was
signed, "1.1. Unit 4, Gen. Field Marshal
Cin. SLA."
The drive* s license enclosed in the
communique was cut diagonally in
half. Part of Miss Hearst's signature
and part of her photograph were
visible. A Hearst family spokesman
said he had been told by the Phoenix
that the underground newspaper's
attorney had confirmed the
authenticity of the driver's license.
Food For Poor
Earlier yesterday, the Hearst Corp.
said its $4-million offer of free food
for the poor will be withdrawn if Miss
Hearst is not released within one
month. The corporation said it had
placed the money in escrow yesterday,
and that it would be released for a
food giveaway if Miss Hearst were
released unharmed before May 3.
"This is not a threat, simply a term
of the escrow," said
Hearst, the girl's father. "We could
have made it 60 days, but we want our
daughter back sooner. This gives the
SLA 30 days to make up its mind. All
they have to say is yes or no."
The kidnapers said in the
communique that they had sent the
latest communication to the Phoenix
with the understanding "that you
must not cooperate with the FBI by
turning over this communication or by
providing them with any
information."
