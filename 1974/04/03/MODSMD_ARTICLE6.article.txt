The black students' theme house
will be changed from Roble Hall to
Olivo - Magnolia in Lagunita Court
next year, Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs for residential
education, told an overflow crowd at
the Olivo-Magnolia lounge last night.
Horton told a group of more than
100 students that the black-initiated
move from Roble Hall will take place,
and said that present Olivo-Magnolia
residents will go through a special
procedure for the upcoming spring
housing draw.
"You [present residents] would
have gotten a priority for
Olivo-Magnolia We will give you a
priority for any house, and you will
get into there if your number qualified
you to get into University housing,"
Horton explained.
Residential Education office
staffers worked under deadline
pressure to tie up loose ends prior to
distribution of spring draw booklets
today. All housing decisions had to be
made before the booklet went out.

Meanwhile the Committee on
Student Services has rejected four
proposals for new theme houses. One
concerned a black cultural center;
another suggested establishing a "co-ed
fraternity." Students also suggested
setting up a Jewish cultural center and
a Russian theme house, according to
Horton.
"The Alpha Sigma Phi proposal
[for a co-ed fraternity] was rejected
on the grounds that the committee
felt, unanimously, that to exempt that
house from the draw would create a
precedent and an exception that was
not warranted by the circumstances,"
Horton stated.
