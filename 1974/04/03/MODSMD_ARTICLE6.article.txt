# Black Theme House Changed To Lagunita
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The black students' theme house
will be changed from Roble Hall to
Olivo - Magnolia in Lagunita Court
next year, Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs for residential
education, told an overflow crowd at
the Olivo-Magnolia lounge last night.
Horton told a group of more than
100 students that the black-initiated
move from Roble Hall will take place,
and said that present Olivo-Magnolia
residents will go through a special
procedure for the upcoming spring
housing draw.
"You [present residents] would
have gotten a priority for
Olivo-Magnolia We will give you a
priority for any house, and you will
get into there if your number qualified
you to get into University housing,"
Horton explained.
Residential Education office
staffers worked under deadline
pressure to tie up loose ends prior to
distribution of spring draw booklets
today. All housing decisions had to be
made before the booklet went out.

Meanwhile the Committee on
Student Services has rejected four
proposals for new theme houses. One
concerned a black cultural center;
another suggested establishing a "co-ed
fraternity." Students also suggested
setting up a Jewish cultural center and
a Russian theme house, according to
Horton.
"The Alpha Sigma Phi proposal
[for a co-ed fraternity] was rejected
on the grounds that the committee
felt, unanimously, that to exempt that
house from the draw would create a
precedent and an exception that was
not warranted by the circumstances,"
Horton stated.
"The committee recommended that
an advisory committee be set up to
advise the dean on the equity of
housing, since men have options open
to them that women do not have," he
elaborated.
Horton had stated earlier it would
be "difficult to defend" rejection of
the proposal solely on a basis of sex.
Horton noted that the black and
Jewish cultural centers were rejected
for identical reasons.
"The Jewish proposal and the black
students' cultural center were denied
on the grounds that there was a high

probability that both houses
eventually would be wholly or almost
entirely inhabited by one racial or
ethnic minority," said Horton.
"Stanford is not in the business of
balkanizing student residences."
Finally the committee felt that the
program for the Russian theme house
was inadequate, he added.
Horton explained that the house
currently located at 584 Mayfield Ave.
will be part of the upcoming draw. He
noted that the addition is part of a
continuing administrative policy to
convert houses to the draw system
when they become available.

Horton explained that the house
currently located at 584 Mayfield Ave.
will be part of the upcoming draw. He
noted that the addition is part of a
continuing administrative policy to
convert houses to the draw system
when they become available.
The black students' theme house
will be changed from Roble Hall to
Olivo - Magnolia in Lagunita Court
next year, Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs for residential
education, told an overflow crowd at
the Olivo-Magnolia lounge last night.
Horton told a group of more than
100 students that the black-initiated
move from Roble Hall will take place,
and said that present Olivo-Magnolia
residents will go through a special
procedure for the upcoming spring
housing draw.
"You [present residents] would
have gotten a priority for
Olivo-Magnolia We will give you a
priority for any house, and you will
get into there if your number qualified
you to get into University housing,"
Horton explained.
Residential Education office
staffers worked under deadline
pressure to tie up loose ends prior to
distribution of spring draw booklets
today. All housing decisions had to be
made before the booklet went out.

Meanwhile the Committee on
Student Services has rejected four
proposals for new theme houses. One
concerned a black cultural center;
another suggested establishing a "co-ed
fraternity." Students also suggested
setting up a Jewish cultural center and
a Russian theme house, according to
Horton.
"The Alpha Sigma Phi proposal
[for a co-ed fraternity] was rejected
on the grounds that the committee
felt, unanimously, that to exempt that
house from the draw would create a
precedent and an exception that was
not warranted by the circumstances,"
Horton stated.
"The committee recommended that
an advisory committee be set up to
advise the dean on the equity of
housing, since men have options open
to them that women do not have," he
elaborated.
Horton had stated earlier it would
be "difficult to defend" rejection of
the proposal solely on a basis of sex.
Horton noted that the black and
Jewish cultural centers were rejected
for identical reasons.
"The Jewish proposal and the black
students' cultural center were denied
on the grounds that there was a high

probability that both houses
eventually would be wholly or almost
entirely inhabited by one racial or
ethnic minority," said Horton.
"Stanford is not in the business of
balkanizing student residences."
Finally the committee felt that the
program for the Russian theme house
was inadequate, he added.
Horton explained that the house
currently located at 584 Mayfield Ave.
will be part of the upcoming draw. He
noted that the addition is part of a
continuing administrative policy to
convert houses to the draw system
when they become available.
