# Computer Fouls Up Grades
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Students in 18 winter quarter
classes received the wrong grade due to
computer keypunch errors. Over 1,000
students, enrolled in classes in 11
different disciplines, were affected by
the mistakes.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she
first was made aware of the incorrect
grade' slips Monday morning when
professors and students began calling
to point out mistakes.
At first there was no way to
determine the extent of error. But by
3 p.m. Mahoney said, "There was
finally a pattern." Later the list of
classes in which errors had occurred
was narrowed down.
Corrected grade reports and
permanent record labels for the
studenfe transcripts will be made. The
new grade reports will be available
Thursday morning at the information
section of the Registrar's Office in the
Old Union.
Names Omitted
The problem began when the
records of four students were
keypunched, with the names omitted.
In each class in which one of the
students was enrolled, the blank-name
floated to the top of the class list and
received the grade intended for the
student first in alphabetical order.
The first student received the real
grade of the second and so on, down
to the place in the alphbetical order
where the blank-name student should
have been. Students following that
point received the correct grades.
Mahoney said that this is the first
time that a mistake other than "an
occasional error that someone calls to
our attention," has occurred in the
grading process.
New Safeguards
She added that the Registrars
Office and the staff at the Stanford
Center for Information Processing will
investigate new safeguards against
similar mistakes. The classes affected

Students in 18 winter quarter
classes received the wrong grade due to
computer keypunch errors. Over 1,000
students, enrolled in classes in 11
different disciplines, were affected by
the mistakes.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she
first was made aware of the incorrect
grade' slips Monday morning when
professors and students began calling
to point out mistakes.
At first there was no way to
determine the extent of error. But by
3 p.m. Mahoney said, "There was
finally a pattern." Later the list of
classes in which errors had occurred
was narrowed down.
Corrected grade reports and
permanent record labels for the
studenfe transcripts will be made. The
new grade reports will be available
Thursday morning at the information
section of the Registrar's Office in the
Old Union.
Names Omitted
The problem began when the
records of four students were
keypunched, with the names omitted.
In each class in which one of the
students was enrolled, the blank-name
floated to the top of the class list and
received the grade intended for the
student first in alphabetical order.
The first student received the real
grade of the second and so on, down
to the place in the alphbetical order
where the blank-name student should
have been. Students following that
point received the correct grades.
Mahoney said that this is the first
time that a mistake other than "an
occasional error that someone calls to
our attention," has occurred in the
grading process.
New Safeguards
She added that the Registrars
Office and the staff at the Stanford
Center for Information Processing will
investigate new safeguards against
similar mistakes. The classes affected
are as follows:
