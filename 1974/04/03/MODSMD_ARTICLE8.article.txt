## Taylor Murder 
### 
As law enforcement officials search for clues in the tragic
slaying of Janet Ann Taylor, members of the University
community should take time to reflect on this latest
incident of violence.
This murder represents the third unsolved homicide that
has taken place in the University community within the span
of little over a year.
Taylor was last seen hitchhiking on a well traveled road in
the evening. But while we aren't condemning hitchhiking as
a form of transportation, we are saying that caution must be
used.
Don't hitchhike alone and certainly tell friends where
you are going. Use caution when hitchhiking at night. Young
women or anyone for that matter should not hitchhike
alone.
Roads should be picked with care. Choose a relatively
well-traveled road and if you are hitchhiking at night use a
well-lighted road.
Caution should also be used in accepting rides.
These suggestions have been repeated many times. But in
light of this most recent tragedy they merit attention.
Caution isn't that hard to use, especially when it can
mean the difference between life and death.
