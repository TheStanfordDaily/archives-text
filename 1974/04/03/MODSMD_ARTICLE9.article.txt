On March 11, a Daily article
reported renewed demands by the
Union for Radical Political
Economics (URPE) on the
Economics Dept. for a
commitment to teaching Marxian
economics. Statements by
department chairman Moses
Abramovitz quoted in that article
constitute a clear attempt on his
part to obscure and distort the
issues
Abramovitz cited "the
Marxian economics workshop that
is now a regular departmental
seminar, a graduate theory course
on Marx, Don Harris' courses, and
the recently approved field of
study in 'alternative approaches to
economic analysis.'"
His list sounds impressive until
you look more closely. Harris'
courses will end this spring when
his contract expires; departmental
failure to consider a tenure offer
to Harris was one reason we
drafted our recent statement.
The seminar is now sponsored
by Gurley and Harris; Harris will
be gone next year, and Gurley will
be on leave Autumn quarter. The
graduate theory course is Jack
Gurley's. It's a good course, but a
single course can but scratch the
surface of a topic as vast as
Marxian economics.
And the new field, which is not

Marxian economics, is an empty
shell until someone is hired to
teach it. The relevant search
committee has just begun
soliciting names, and, given its late
start, may find itself unable to
find anyone qualified who is
available for next year.
This last fact makes
particularly ironic Abramovitz's
chiding us for "showing no
patience" and trying to "needle
the faculty." But had we kept
silent, no action would have been
taken by the faculty to provide
for any graduate offerings in
Marxian economics next year. In
fact, nothing was done until we
circulated a petition which made
clear extensive student support for
a Marxian economics program.
Last December, I and others
sent Abramovitz a letter in which
we noted that nothing had been
done by the department to find
out what Marxians were in the job
market.
We noted that such a
preliminary search would
"preclude the suggestion that the
department enters this discussion
having already determined a
negative response." Abramovitz
never responded to this, yet he
wonders that we are "impatient."

a Marxian economics program.
Last December, I and others
sent Abramovitz a letter in which
we noted that nothing had been
done by the department to find
out what Marxians were in the job
market.
We noted that such a
preliminary search would
"preclude the suggestion that the
department enters this discussion
having already determined a
negative response." Abramovitz
never responded to this, yet he
wonders that we are "impatient."
