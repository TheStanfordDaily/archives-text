# Patricia Hearst Informs Parents She Has Joined Ranks Of SLA

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Patricia
Hearst, the newspaper heiress who was
dragged screaming from her apartment
two months ago, renounced her family
yesterday and declared she was joining
her terrorist kidnapers as a
revolutionary.
"I have changed — grown. I've
become conscious and can never go
back to the life we led before," said
the tape-recorded voice identified by
her parents as that of the 20-year-old
Patricia, whose life had been held

against demands for millions of dollars
of free food for the poor.
The sudden declaration, one day
after a sign that her release by the
mysterious Symbionese Liberation
Army appeared imminent, left
Patricia's parents stunned and
disbelieving.
Father's Skepticism
"Personally, I don't believe it,"
newspaper executive Randolph A.
Hearst said after hearing the tape.
"We've had her 20 years, they've had

her 60 days, and I don't believe she's
going to change her philosophy that
quickly or that radically."
"If it is her choice to become a
member of an organization like this,
we still love her," he added.
Hearst's wife, Catherine, agreed,
telling newsmen outside the family's
home near here: "1 know my daughter
very well ... I know my girl. She
would never join any organization like
that without being coerced."
Unresponsive
The couple, whose life for the past
eight weeks had shifted from
desperation to often-expressed hope,
spoke only those words, answering no
questions from the cluster of newsmen
gathered in front of their home. Their
brief statements were carried live by
local television stations.
Patricia's fiance, Steven Weed, on
the verge of tears, later told newsmen
it seemed "incredibly cynical on the
part of the SLA" to think that "I can
believe Patty has refused her freedom
and even more that she has refused to
talk to me or explain to me what's
been on her mind for the past several
weeks."
'Stay And Fight'
On the tape, which also carried
death threats by the SLA against three
so-called "enemies of the people,"
Patricia said she was speaking her own
mind and had chosen to "stay and
fight." Her freedom, therefore,
became no longer a matter of
negotiation, according to an SLA
leader who also spoke on the recording
and said she could leave at any time
she wanted.
The SLA voice indicated as well
that the abduction of Patricia would
be the group's last kidnaping. .. In
the future no prisoners of the ruling
class or its executive agents will be
taken prisoner," he said. "The Court
of the People this date issues the

following order: All corporate enemies
of the people will be shot on sight at
any time and at any place."
The revelations of the 20-minute
tape recording left authorities
perplexed.
Official's Reaction
"If she now is saying she was never
taken against her will, then you don't
have a crime," U.S. Atty. James L.
Browning Jr. said.
"Partially out of fairness to the
victim, I suppose, and partially if you
have a victim unwilling to prosecute,
you may not be able to convince
anybody that anybody's guilty,"
Browning said.
But the FBI agent in charge of the
case, Charles Bates, said: "As far as
we're concerned, we still have
violations of the law and are
investigating." Bates said he did not
know whether Patricia was staying
with the SLA of her own free will. "I
don't feel it makes any difference in
our investigation," he said.
The taped message was delivered to
a San Francisco radio station one day
after another "communique" that
promised details of Patricia's release
