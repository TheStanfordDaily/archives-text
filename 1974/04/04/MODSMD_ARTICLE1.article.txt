# Patricia Hearst Informs Parents She Has Joined Ranks Of SLA

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Patricia
Hearst, the newspaper heiress who was
dragged screaming from her apartment
two months ago, renounced her family
yesterday and declared she was joining
her terrorist kidnapers as a
revolutionary.
"I have changed — grown. I've
become conscious and can never go
back to the life we led before," said
the tape-recorded voice identified by
her parents as that of the 20-year-old
Patricia, whose life had been held

against demands for millions of dollars
of free food for the poor.
The sudden declaration, one day
after a sign that her release by the
mysterious Symbionese Liberation
Army appeared imminent, left
Patricia's parents stunned and
disbelieving.
Father's Skepticism
"Personally, I don't believe it,"
newspaper executive Randolph A.
Hearst said after hearing the tape.
"We've had her 20 years, they've had

her 60 days, and I don't believe she's
going to change her philosophy that
quickly or that radically."
"If it is her choice to become a
member of an organization like this,
we still love her," he added.
Hearst's wife, Catherine, agreed,
telling newsmen outside the family's
home near here: "1 know my daughter
very well ... I know my girl. She
would never join any organization like
that without being coerced."
Unresponsive
The couple, whose life for the past
eight weeks had shifted from
desperation to often-expressed hope,
spoke only those words, answering no
questions from the cluster of newsmen
gathered in front of their home. Their
brief statements were carried live by
local television stations.
Patricia's fiance, Steven Weed, on
the verge of tears, later told newsmen
it seemed "incredibly cynical on the
part of the SLA" to think that "I can
believe Patty has refused her freedom
and even more that she has refused to
talk to me or explain to me what's
been on her mind for the past several
weeks."
'Stay And Fight'
On the tape, which also carried
death threats by the SLA against three
so-called "enemies of the people,"
Patricia said she was speaking her own
mind and had chosen to "stay and
fight." Her freedom, therefore,
became no longer a matter of
negotiation, according to an SLA
leader who also spoke on the recording
and said she could leave at any time
she wanted.
The SLA voice indicated as well
that the abduction of Patricia would
be the group's last kidnaping. .. In
the future no prisoners of the ruling
class or its executive agents will be
taken prisoner," he said. "The Court
of the People this date issues the

following order: All corporate enemies
of the people will be shot on sight at
any time and at any place."
The revelations of the 20-minute
tape recording left authorities
perplexed.
Official's Reaction
"If she now is saying she was never
taken against her will, then you don't
have a crime," U.S. Atty. James L.
Browning Jr. said.
"Partially out of fairness to the
victim, I suppose, and partially if you
have a victim unwilling to prosecute,
you may not be able to convince
anybody that anybody's guilty,"
Browning said.
But the FBI agent in charge of the
case, Charles Bates, said: "As far as
we're concerned, we still have
violations of the law and are
investigating." Bates said he did not
know whether Patricia was staying
with the SLA of her own free will. "I
don't feel it makes any difference in
our investigation," he said.
The taped message was delivered to
a San Francisco radio station one day
after another "communique" that
promised details of Patricia's release

PUBLISHER RANDOLPH HEARST — The father of Patricia Hearst spoke to
the press yesterday to question the validity of his daughter's taped statement.
would be provided within 72 hours.
That message had signaled an apparent
end to the two-month Hearst family
ordeal during which $2 million in free
food was given away and another $4
million pledged to secure the young
woman's release.
Sister's Response
Patricia's 18-year-old sister Ann
arrived at the family home in suburban
Hillsborough moments after the tape
was delivered."I know Patty far too
well to think she'd come around like
that. She only hears one side of the
story ... I don't believe it. She's too
bull-headed."
But on the tape, the latest in a
series of suddenly delivered
communications from the terrorist
group, Patricia said: "I have learned
how vicious the pig really is, and our
comrades are teaching me to attack
with even greater viciousness . .."
Thomas O'Hare, program director
of KSAN, the station to which the
message was sent, said the envelope

contained the tape, a typed transcript,
a color photograph and a thin slip of
paper which said the other half of
Patricia's driver's license was included.
But the document, the other half of
which was received Tuesday, was not
included.
Holds Rifle
The photograph showed Patricia
holding an automatic rifle and
standing in front of a banner bearing
the seven-headed cobra symbol of the
SLA.
The man who identified himself as
Cinque, SLA General Field Marshal,
said in the tape recording: "There is
no further need to discuss the release
of the prisoner, since she is now a
comrade and has been accepted into
the ranks of the peoples' army as a
comrade and fighter. And there is no
further basis for negotiations since the
subject may leave whenever she feels
that she wishes to do so, and she is
armed and perfectly willing and able
to defend herself."
