# Frenchman's Terrace Controversy

William Ross

The University's proposed Frenchman's
Terrace project, a 225 unit complex designed
for people with modest incomes, has been
heavily attacked by numerous groups during
the past three years. However, indications
now are that the present opposition will
delay, but not destroy the best plans for
construction of the project.
Frenchman's Terrace was originally
proposed in the late 1960s when Stanford's
Wright and Moulton Committees identified
the need for low income housing for
University employees. In 1970, the Board of
Trustees approved construction of the
project at Page Mill and Peter Coutts Roads.
But it soon came under intense criticism
from the residents of the area.
The College Terrace Resident's
Association and the Palo Alto Tenants Union
insisted the University decided to construct
the project as a token gesture to improve its
public image and appease low income groups.
Venceremos, the now disbanded Bay Area
Maoist organization, expressed the same
criticism, albeit in stronger language.
Conservative Opposition
The project was attacked not only by the
left, but also by many conservatives in the
region of Palo Alto and the University, who
objected to the influx of low income people
the project would bring into the area. At the
present time, many of the lower income
Stanford employees live a considerable
distance from the University.
Opposition to the project mounted in
1972, but became unnecessary in January
1973, when a federal moratorium on funds
for projects such as Frenchman's Terrace
was promulgated.
In October, the freeze on funds was lifted
enough to renew support for the project. The
attacks on the plan resumed almost
immediately.
The San Francisco Chronicle ran an article
stating that far from benefitting the poor, the
project would be a "luxurious housing
development" designed primarily for people

with substantial incomes.
The Chronicle pointed out that only 20
percent of the units in Frenchman's Terrace
would be allocated to people with low
incomes. Forty percent would be devoted to
people with moderate incomes who would
receive federal subsidies in the renting and
purchasing of their homes. Another forty
percent would be sold at market price.
Occupancy Restrictions
A further criticism of the project has been
that it would be built with occupancy
restrictions. 50 percent of the units would be
allocated to Stanford employees, 25 percent
to employees of firms located on Stanford
land, and 25 percent to people who work in
the area but who are unrelated to the
University.
In February of this year, James Price, area
director of the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD), announced
he will probably insist the Frenchman's
Terrace project be built without occupancy
restrictions.
At least two members of the Palo Alto
City Council — Vice Mayor Enid Pearson and
Richard Rosenbaum — agreed with Price.
The University has requested that the City
Council annex the land on which the project
would be built, claiming the University is not
prepared to provide municipal services for
Frenchman's Terrace.
Council Pressure
Some members of the Council indicated
that unless occupancy restrictions are
removed, they would oppose annexation of
the land.
A further setback for the project occurred
this week, when the NAACP filed a suit in
federal court to prevent the construction of
the Terrace, echoing the complaint of the
Chronicle that the project would not benefit
the poor.
Despite considerable opposition to the
project, the University still is determined to
go ahead with its construction plans, claiming
Frenchman's Terrace would provide a

valuable service to residents of the area.
Because Stanford is providing the land for
the project — although it would administer it
jointly with the Urban Coalition — the
University has a right to establish occupancy
restrictions to insure that its own employees
would benefit from the project, Stanford
officials claim.
Not Luxury Housing
Not only is the project legal under federal
law, but it would hardly constitute luxury
housing, University officials assert. They say
the units would be of quality construction
and as pleasant for residents as possible, but
designed for people with modest incomes.
The University planned units of varying
incomes in order to prevent the project from
becoming a ghetto for low income people.
The outcome of the NAACP lawsuit and
opposition within HUD and the Palo Alto
City Council are uncertain. But the
University seems to enjoy considerable
support in its struggle to carry through the
Fenchman's Terrace project.
Council Support
Several members of the City Council —
most notably Roy Clay — believe the project
would genuinely benefit the poor people in
the Palo Alto area.
It is obvious that the University is
supported by the federal government;
otherwise funds for the project would never
have been made available in a time of limited
allocation to social service projects.
Furthermore, the Palo Alto-Stanford
chapter of NAACP hasn't supported the
lawsuit against the project.
There is no reason to assume the
University will be defeated in its plans to
construct Frenchman's Terrace. There is
justification for believing the project will
someday be built.
But every attack on the proposed
Frenchman's Terrace complex will further
delay its construction.
