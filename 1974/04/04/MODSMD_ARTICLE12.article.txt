# Contra Federal Campaign Funding

Various proposals to limit campaign
spending and to substitute in whole or in part
money taken from the taxpayers are at
present being debated in the halls of Congress
and in the news media. These proposals are
all direct attacks on the First Amendment
rights of free speech and a free press.
Any limitation on an individual's right to
contribute infringes upon his right of free
expression. The essence of freedom of speech
is the prohibition of governmental
interference with a man's hiring a hall to say
whatever he wants.
Similarly, the essence of freedom of the
press is the prohibition of governmental
interference with publishing.
If a person is prohibited from spending
money to express his support for a political
candidate, then that person's liberties have
been severely undermined. An election
commission with tyrannical powers would be
presiding over political expression.
Citizen's Rights?
The proposal to have tax-supported
election campaigns not only takes a citizen's
earnings, but puts that money in the pockets
of men the citizen may very well oppose.
Michael Killian of the Chicago Tribune
zeroed in on the issue involved: "Picture
yourself as a South Side Chicago black who
has just turned over a substantial portion of
his income to the IRS and then turns on his
television set to watch part of it being spent
on a TV spot for George Wallace. Or a
Vermont conservative watching a federally
financed George McGovem talking about
how this country needs more taxes."
To add some parallel examples to
Killian's, imagine a New Leftist looking at a
Nixon plug he has paid for, a feminist paying
for an ad for an anti-abortion candidate, or
an anarchist who doesn't like any of the
candidates he is paying to promote.
Anyone who has paid his federal income

tax recently knows that the new "checkoff"
program of federal financing pays only for
the Presidential campaigns of the
Establishment's Republican and Democratic
parties.
Choices Limited
When this program was launched, it was
stated that those who participated could
designate to which party they wished to have
the tax money go. But the tax form does not
allow this.
Supporters of the Peace & Freedom Party,
the American Independent Party, the
Libertarian Party, the Socialist Workers
Party, and other groups are forced to pay for
Republican and Democratic campaigns.
Most of the various campaign spending
bills now in Congress require a
government-sanctioned classification of
groups into major parties and minor parties.
The groups designed as minor are
effectively frozen into a situation in which
uncertain prospects, little money, and
stringent requirements paralyze them.
Status Quo Maintained
At a time when the public is dissatisfied
with the large political parties, they are about
to ensure their own wealthy and perpetual
existence. In September 1973, a Gallup poll
showed that one-third of the American
public identifies with neither the Republicans
nor the Democrats.
At a time when respect for politicians and
trust in the government itself is at a low ebb,
the established politicians are engineering a
successful new raid on the taxpayers'
pocketbook.
At the same time, corporate liberal
business figures (Miles Rubin, Daniel Noyes,
Stanley Steinbaum, and Max Palevsky) are
rallying behind the idea of tax-funded
elections because they hope to re-stabilize a
system shaken by the Watergate revelations.
In the November 10, 1973 issue of

National Journal Reports, Mrs. Susan B.
King, who runs the Center for Public
Financing of Elections, is quoted on the large
support the idea has received from the
wealthy.
Big-Business Support
Business Week for September 15, 1973
reported that many business executives are
strongly in favor of limiting campaign
contributions and says that "many are willing
to consi&er some government subsidy."
These corporate liberal leaders feel
uncomfortable with the local interests who
gain a voice through present-day election
spending. Instead these corporate liberals,
whose own activities are national in scope,
feel comfortable with the politicking of
government-business planning groups like
Nelson Rockefeller's Critical Issues
Commission or the Committee on Economic
Development.
Reforms' Loopholes
Under the proposed campaign reforms, we
can expect simply that payments from large
business and labor groups will no longer be in
money form. Personnel will be donated,
equipment will be loaned, meeting sites will
be made available at no cost.
Campaigns for programs that are linked in
the public's mind with a specific candidate
will be promoted by "public interest"
groupings of the candidate's followers.
In sum, the proposed campaign financing
laws are an assault on free political
expression. As Yale professor Ralph Winter
says, "A law forbidding someone from
spending a certain amount cannot be
distinguished from a law forbidding speeches
of over 10 minutes in public parks." In
addition, the law favors the incumbent
politicians and those who like the American
system as it is.
