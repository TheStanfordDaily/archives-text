# USE To Strike?
## 
### 
Jesse Colvillo h

We—students, workers /
employees, staff, professors and
administrators—as Daily readers
have been somewhat informed
about the present negotiations
involving the administration
(Doug Barton and friends) and
United Stanford Employees
(USE) Local 680.
We should start to take an
interest in this matter and start to
ask ourselves and the University
just how this matter affects us.
One question at the present
time is, what happens when the
negotiations are at a deadlock and
neither side is willing to settle on
a contract?
For one thing USE has been
talking and preparing for a
possible strike. The Service
Employees International (SEIU)
has given USE the sanction to
strike (Employees Organize
March, 1974). This is the same
International that represents the
same Locals that went out on
strike and almost put San
Francisco at a standstill.
Same Results?
So now, we can ask ourselves,
can USE create the same chaotic
situation as in the City, if they go
out on strike? And will students
and other employees have to tap
the bill after a strike is settled?
Presently USE has concluded
its negotiations with the
administration (March 28, 1974)
and on April 11 the membership
(1400 members) will be asked to
vote on the acceptance or
rejection of the contract and also
to take a strike vote.
The University in its counter
proposal refused to meet USE's
financial demands; minimum
wages, cost-of4iving policy and
benefits. These financial demands
in themselves are basically the
ones any employee will ask for
and struggle for as well.
Workers Excluded
Also, the administration
excluded these workers (in the
bargaining unit) from Stanford's
Financial Report. The
administration's reasoning was
that these workers' salaries are not
payed out of Stanford's budget,
but are "funded by grants,
contracts, auxiliaries and service
units, which are self-sustaining
and budgeted separately."
(Stanford Observer—March '74)
Glenda Jones, ex-president of
USE, told me that the University
was out to confuse its readers and
"anyway the University is so
interrelated" that she couldn't see
why these workers weren't
included in the budget.

Deceptive Reports
The reader should not be
fooled and sidetracked by the
administration's propaganda
(Stanford Observer, Campus
Report), that it lacks the reserves
to meet the financial demands of
USE. The Administration does
have the necessary funds.
Their argument to the contrary
can in the future be used to
justify a tuition increase, thus
making students pay for the
necessary and just requests of the
workers. We students should
understand this ploy and be ready
to expose it as a crude attempt to
divide the entire campus
co mmunity—workers and
students.
1 haven't mentioned non-unit
employees (workers who are
outside of the present contract).
Will they also go out on strike so
to be considered for the financial
demands of USE?
USE on March 12, 1974,
informed its non-unit members
that USE can and will represent
them in the present negotiations
under "minority bargaining."
Ambiguous Policy
The Administration has
informed its employees and USE
that employees do have the right
to not cross a picket line, "but"
the Administration at the same
time stated that the University
may and can replace those
employees who do.
In conclusion, the Stanford
community has not been prepared
for the inconveniences of a strike.
And even if they weren't prepared
the main point is that the
University does not want to meet
the financial demands of its
employees.
Students and other workers
will be caught in the middle of a
labor dispute and probably be
asked (in the future) to pay out
more tuition and workers take a
cut in buying power.
If that is the case then we
should pressure the administration
to settle the contract as soon as
possible and pay all workers
adequate wages in these times of
rising inflation.
If the University imposes a
tuition hike — let's hope students
are organized to resist this move
and hope the workers will support
the students in return.

Presently USE has concluded
its negotiations with the
administration (March 28, 1974)
and on April 11 the membership
(1400 members) will be asked to
vote on the acceptance or
rejection of the contract and also
to take a strike vote.
The University in its counter
proposal refused to meet USE's
financial demands; minimum
wages, cost-of4iving policy and
benefits. These financial demands
in themselves are basically the
ones any employee will ask for
and struggle for as well.
Workers Excluded
Also, the administration
excluded these workers (in the
bargaining unit) from Stanford's
Financial Report. The
administration's reasoning was
that these workers' salaries are not
payed out of Stanford's budget,
but are "funded by grants,
contracts, auxiliaries and service
units, which are self-sustaining
and budgeted separately."
(Stanford Observer—March '74)
Glenda Jones, ex-president of
USE, told me that the University
was out to confuse its readers and
"anyway the University is so
interrelated" that she couldn't see
why these workers weren't
included in the budget.

Deceptive Reports
The reader should not be
fooled and sidetracked by the
administration's propaganda
(Stanford Observer, Campus
Report), that it lacks the reserves
to meet the financial demands of
USE. The Administration does
have the necessary funds.
Their argument to the contrary
can in the future be used to
justify a tuition increase, thus
making students pay for the
necessary and just requests of the
workers. We students should
understand this ploy and be ready
to expose it as a crude attempt to
divide the entire campus
co mmunity—workers and
students.
1 haven't mentioned non-unit
employees (workers who are
outside of the present contract).
Will they also go out on strike so
to be considered for the financial
demands of USE?
USE on March 12, 1974,
informed its non-unit members
that USE can and will represent
them in the present negotiations
under "minority bargaining."
Ambiguous Policy
The Administration has
informed its employees and USE
that employees do have the right
to not cross a picket line, "but"
the Administration at the same
time stated that the University
may and can replace those
employees who do.
In conclusion, the Stanford
community has not been prepared
for the inconveniences of a strike.
And even if they weren't prepared
the main point is that the
University does not want to meet
the financial demands of its
employees.
Students and other workers
will be caught in the middle of a
labor dispute and probably be
asked (in the future) to pay out
more tuition and workers take a
cut in buying power.
If that is the case then we
should pressure the administration
to settle the contract as soon as
possible and pay all workers
adequate wages in these times of
rising inflation.
If the University imposes a
tuition hike — let's hope students
are organized to resist this move
and hope the workers will support
the students in return.

We—students, workers /
employees, staff, professors and
administrators—as Daily readers
have been somewhat informed
about the present negotiations
involving the administration
(Doug Barton and friends) and
United Stanford Employees
(USE) Local 680.
We should start to take an
interest in this matter and start to
ask ourselves and the University
just how this matter affects us.
One question at the present
time is, what happens when the
negotiations are at a deadlock and
neither side is willing to settle on
a contract?
For one thing USE has been
talking and preparing for a
possible strike. The Service
Employees International (SEIU)
has given USE the sanction to
strike (Employees Organize
March, 1974). This is the same
International that represents the
same Locals that went out on
strike and almost put San
Francisco at a standstill.
Same Results?
So now, we can ask ourselves,
can USE create the same chaotic
situation as in the City, if they go
out on strike? And will students
and other employees have to tap
the bill after a strike is settled?
Presently USE has concluded
its negotiations with the
administration (March 28, 1974)
