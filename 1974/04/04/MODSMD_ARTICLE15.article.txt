# Talented Journey Outshines Black Oak Gimmickry
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO—When Jo
Jo Gunne failed to arrive at
Saturday night's concert, the bill
at Winterland became the
incarnation of that trite old
phrase about the sublime and the
ridiculous.
Journey, perhaps the best
emerging band to play in the Bay
Area for a long time, was forced
to play warm-up to what is
considered by many to be the
worst rock and roll band of this or
any other time, Black Oak
Arkansas.
The subtleties of Journey's
style are difficult to explain, but
their impact is not. Their speed
and precision hit hard, yet they
never lose the musical depth and
continuity of a piece, and they
never become monotonous.

Drummer Ansley Dunbar has
been added to the group since its
debut on New Year's Eve, and
while this is certainly an
improvement, Dunbar still seems
to be the weak point in the
line-up. However, this isn't
entirely his fault, since by all
reasonable standards Dunbar is
quite competent.
Lead guitarist Neal Schon is
the problem. He's good. He may
be too good. Past a certain level of
ability it becomes useless to
compare guitarists, but Schon is
already playing at a level which
makes it difficult for other
musicians to keep up with him.
Schon can play slow and
tender, then burst into a lead,
then return to the melodic
passage, and throughout the
process show no sign of strain.

While his left hand barely moves,
Schon's slender fingers move
amazingly fast, taking runs so high
up the fretboard that the sound
system refuses to handle them.
Keyboardman Gregg Rolie
doesn't fare much better than
Dunbar when it comes to keeping
up with Schon, and sweat pours
down his face as he launches into
a vocal from behind his
organ-and-synthesizer barricade.
After hearing Journey for the
second time, these few flaws show
through, but nothing mars their
music. Although individual talent
may be lacking in places, the
group as a unit turns out a tight
and musically exciting sound.
"Kohoutek," an amazing
instrumental piece, begins with a
slow, drifting keyboard and guitar
intro which then explodes into a

fast rhythmic pattern.
Again, the tempo speeds up
with a split-second change that
the audience doesn't see coming
until it's all over. Indeed,
Journey's major strength lies in
their smooth and adept transitions
from tempo to tempo and key to
key. This ability contributes to
their solid, sophisticated sound.
With a goodly portion of the
crowd on their feet, Journey was
called back for a well-earned
encore by the glow of flickering
matches in the balcony. Perhaps
Black Oak Arkansas's lead singer
could be compared to Roger
Dal trey in drag, the major
difference being that Daltrey can
sing whereas Black Oak's leader
grunts.
Alice Cooper in drag is a better
likeness. Yet Cooper has a flair for
genuine perversion and existential
drama, while Black Oak's leader
merely pounds his crotch with a
tambourine or commits mock
self-abuse with a washboard.
Musically, Black Oak's four
guitarists solo over each others'

solos, making it difficult to find
any kind of continuity in the
incessantly droning and
exceedingly loud boogie-tempo
pieces. However, to the untrained
ear all of the songs sound identical
so it's difficult to get lost.
Obviously, some types of
people find this kind of music
exciting, or Black Oak Arkansas
wouldn't have gotten four encores
Saturday night. Black Oak does
put out a constant beat, and their
drummer performed an
exceptionally strong solo which
included a portion played with his
bare hands instead of drum sticks.
Overall, however, Black Oak
Arkansas is an incredibly boring
group. The gyrations of the lead
singer are more comical than sexy,
and when two different young
women climbed up on stage to
dance with the singer, he suddenly
seemed more stand-offish. Some
stage hands finally carted the two
girls off the stage, and the lead
singer resumed his pelvic thrusts.
We live in the time of Alice
Cooper, Bette Middler, David

Bowie, and a thousand less known
bands with equally gaudy images.
Gimmickry is as old as Liberace
and older, but it does not
substitute for genuine talent.
Black Oak Arkansas may have
lots of hair, lots of sound, lots of
guitars, and maybe even lots of

fans. But when a different style of
gimmick comes in vogue, the fans
may be gone.
Neal Schon and Journey,
however, have taken but a single,
simple step. As musicians for
whom sound comes before image,
they have many more steps to
take.

through, but nothing mars their
music. Although individual talent
may be lacking in places, the
group as a unit turns out a tight
and musically exciting sound.
"Kohoutek," an amazing
instrumental piece, begins with a
slow, drifting keyboard and guitar
intro which then explodes into a

fast rhythmic pattern.
Again, the tempo speeds up
with a split-second change that
the audience doesn't see coming
until it's all over. Indeed,
Journey's major strength lies in
their smooth and adept transitions
from tempo to tempo and key to
key. This ability contributes to
their solid, sophisticated sound.
With a goodly portion of the
crowd on their feet, Journey was
called back for a well-earned
encore by the glow of flickering
matches in the balcony. Perhaps
Black Oak Arkansas's lead singer
could be compared to Roger
Dal trey in drag, the major
difference being that Daltrey can
sing whereas Black Oak's leader
grunts.
Alice Cooper in drag is a better
likeness. Yet Cooper has a flair for
genuine perversion and existential
drama, while Black Oak's leader
merely pounds his crotch with a
tambourine or commits mock
self-abuse with a washboard.
Musically, Black Oak's four
guitarists solo over each others'

solos, making it difficult to find
any kind of continuity in the
incessantly droning and
exceedingly loud boogie-tempo
pieces. However, to the untrained
ear all of the songs sound identical
so it's difficult to get lost.
Obviously, some types of
people find this kind of music
exciting, or Black Oak Arkansas
wouldn't have gotten four encores
Saturday night. Black Oak does
put out a constant beat, and their
drummer performed an
exceptionally strong solo which
included a portion played with his
bare hands instead of drum sticks.
Overall, however, Black Oak
Arkansas is an incredibly boring
group. The gyrations of the lead
singer are more comical than sexy,
and when two different young
women climbed up on stage to
dance with the singer, he suddenly
seemed more stand-offish. Some
stage hands finally carted the two
girls off the stage, and the lead
singer resumed his pelvic thrusts.
We live in the time of Alice
Cooper, Bette Middler, David

Bowie, and a thousand less known
bands with equally gaudy images.
Gimmickry is as old as Liberace
and older, but it does not
substitute for genuine talent.
Black Oak Arkansas may have
lots of hair, lots of sound, lots of
guitars, and maybe even lots of

fans. But when a different style of
gimmick comes in vogue, the fans
may be gone.
Neal Schon and Journey,
however, have taken but a single,
simple step. As musicians for
whom sound comes before image,
they have many more steps to
take.

JOURNEYMAN—Lead guitarist Neal Schon plays a mellow section
from Journey's fine instrumental, "Kohoutek." Schon made his first
Winterland debut with Santana in 1970 — Schon was still in
highschool at the time.
SAN FRANCISCO—When Jo
Jo Gunne failed to arrive at
Saturday night's concert, the bill
at Winterland became the
incarnation of that trite old
phrase about the sublime and the
ridiculous.
Journey, perhaps the best
emerging band to play in the Bay
Area for a long time, was forced
to play warm-up to what is
considered by many to be the
worst rock and roll band of this or
any other time, Black Oak
Arkansas.
The subtleties of Journey's
style are difficult to explain, but
their impact is not. Their speed
and precision hit hard, yet they
never lose the musical depth and
continuity of a piece, and they
never become monotonous.

Drummer Ansley Dunbar has
been added to the group since its
debut on New Year's Eve, and
while this is certainly an
improvement, Dunbar still seems
to be the weak point in the
line-up. However, this isn't
entirely his fault, since by all
reasonable standards Dunbar is
quite competent.
Lead guitarist Neal Schon is
the problem. He's good. He may
be too good. Past a certain level of
ability it becomes useless to
compare guitarists, but Schon is
already playing at a level which
makes it difficult for other
musicians to keep up with him.
Schon can play slow and
tender, then burst into a lead,
then return to the melodic
passage, and throughout the
process show no sign of strain.

While his left hand barely moves,
Schon's slender fingers move
amazingly fast, taking runs so high
up the fretboard that the sound
system refuses to handle them.
Keyboardman Gregg Rolie
doesn't fare much better than
Dunbar when it comes to keeping
up with Schon, and sweat pours
down his face as he launches into
a vocal from behind his
organ-and-synthesizer barricade.

and when two different young
women climbed up on stage to
dance with the singer, he suddenly
seemed more stand-offish. Some
stage hands finally carted the two
girls off the stage, and the lead
singer resumed his pelvic thrusts.
We live in the time of Alice
Cooper, Bette Middler, David

Bowie, and a thousand less known
bands with equally gaudy images.
Gimmickry is as old as Liberace
and older, but it does not
substitute for genuine talent.
Black Oak Arkansas may have
lots of hair, lots of sound, lots of
guitars, and maybe even lots of

fans. But when a different style of
gimmick comes in vogue, the fans
may be gone.
Neal Schon and Journey,
however, have taken but a single,
simple step. As musicians for
whom sound comes before image,
they have many more steps to
take.

highschool at the time.
SAN FRANCISCO—When Jo
Jo Gunne failed to arrive at
Saturday night's concert, the bill
at Winterland became the
incarnation of that trite old
phrase about the sublime and the
ridiculous.
Journey, perhaps the best
emerging band to play in the Bay
Area for a long time, was forced
to play warm-up to what is
considered by many to be the
worst rock and roll band of this or
any other time, Black Oak
Arkansas.
The subtleties of Journey's
style are difficult to explain, but
their impact is not. Their speed
and precision hit hard, yet they
never lose the musical depth and
continuity of a piece, and they
never become monotonous.

Drummer Ansley Dunbar has
been added to the group since its
debut on New Year's Eve, and
while this is certainly an
improvement, Dunbar still seems
to be the weak point in the
line-up. However, this isn't
entirely his fault, since by all
reasonable standards Dunbar is
quite competent.
Lead guitarist Neal Schon is
the problem. He's good. He may
be too good. Past a certain level of
ability it becomes useless to
compare guitarists, but Schon is
already playing at a level which
makes it difficult for other
musicians to keep up with him.
Schon can play slow and
tender, then burst into a lead,
then return to the melodic
passage, and throughout the
process show no sign of strain.

While his left hand barely moves,
Schon's slender fingers move
amazingly fast, taking runs so high
up the fretboard that the sound
system refuses to handle them.
Keyboardman Gregg Rolie
doesn't fare much better than
Dunbar when it comes to keeping
up with Schon, and sweat pours
down his face as he launches into
a vocal from behind his
organ-and-synthesizer barricade.
After hearing Journey for the
second time, these few flaws show
through, but nothing mars their
music. Although individual talent
may be lacking in places, the
group as a unit turns out a tight
and musically exciting sound.
"Kohoutek," an amazing
instrumental piece, begins with a
slow, drifting keyboard and guitar
intro which then explodes into a

fast rhythmic pattern.
Again, the tempo speeds up
with a split-second change that
the audience doesn't see coming
until it's all over. Indeed,
Journey's major strength lies in
their smooth and adept transitions
from tempo to tempo and key to
key. This ability contributes to
their solid, sophisticated sound.
With a goodly portion of the
crowd on their feet, Journey was
called back for a well-earned
encore by the glow of flickering
matches in the balcony. Perhaps
Black Oak Arkansas's lead singer
could be compared to Roger
Dal trey in drag, the major
difference being that Daltrey can
sing whereas Black Oak's leader
grunts.
Alice Cooper in drag is a better
likeness. Yet Cooper has a flair for
genuine perversion and existential
drama, while Black Oak's leader
merely pounds his crotch with a
tambourine or commits mock
self-abuse with a washboard.
Musically, Black Oak's four
guitarists solo over each others'

solos, making it difficult to find
any kind of continuity in the
incessantly droning and
exceedingly loud boogie-tempo
pieces. However, to the untrained
ear all of the songs sound identical
so it's difficult to get lost.
Obviously, some types of
people find this kind of music
exciting, or Black Oak Arkansas
wouldn't have gotten four encores
Saturday night. Black Oak does
put out a constant beat, and their
drummer performed an
exceptionally strong solo which
included a portion played with his
bare hands instead of drum sticks.
Overall, however, Black Oak
Arkansas is an incredibly boring
group. The gyrations of the lead
singer are more comical than sexy,
and when two different young
women climbed up on stage to
dance with the singer, he suddenly
seemed more stand-offish. Some
stage hands finally carted the two
girls off the stage, and the lead
singer resumed his pelvic thrusts.
