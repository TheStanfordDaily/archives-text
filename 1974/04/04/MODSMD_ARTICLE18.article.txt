# New Alembic System Gives Dead Quiet, Powerful Sound
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
BRISBANE-The Grateful
Dead, who previewed a brand-new
sound system at their concert in
Maples two years ago, picked the
Cow Palace to test their newest
version March 23.
Why, one might ask, did they
need another system the
"old" model had served so well,
everywhere from Winterland to
Watkins Glen? The answer is the
continuing search by the Dead
and Alembic, their sound
contractors, for perfect fidelity in
live sound projection.
The Dead-Alembic approach
involves a sophisticated array of
powerful amps, spectrum
equalizers and sensitive speakers
which produce loud but clear,
undistorted sound. This is
achieved partly by having a huge
capacity which is never pushed to
its limits.
The newest version, heard in
February at Winterland and this
time at the Cow Palace, has one
important quality in which it
differs from its predecessors: it is
quieter. Through some sort of
acoustic-electronic wizardry,
Alembic has figured out how to
fill a large hall with
well-proportioned sound without
inflicting bodily damage on those
in the front of the audience.
In the middle of the floor, one
could hear quite well, yet talking
over the music was not only
possible, but fairly easy. Only the
vocals tended to be overpowering,
but reports from other areas of
the hall said this was not a
problem elsewhere.
In order to test their new
system, the Dead chose a fairly
standard concert program, from
new tunes to real oldies like
"Morning Dew." Typically, the
first hour or so was fairly relaxed;
after all, if you're going to do a
five-hour show, it's best to pace
yourself.
They began with a new song,
then "Promised Land,"
"Brown-Eved Women," "Mexicali
Blues," "Tennessee Jed," and
"Black Throated Wind." A couple
more new tunes followed, and a
very mellow "El Paso," then "The
Wheel," "Cassidy," "China Cat
Sunflower," "I Know You Rider"
and the "Weather Report Suite"
rounded out the set.
The energy level, though not
the volume, definitely picked up
in the second set, which began
with a 45-minute song-within-a
song-within-a-song. They went
from "Playing in the Band" to
"Uncle John's Band" to "Morning
Dew" and back again, with spacey
and spacious interstitial jams
between guitarists Jerry Garcia

and Bob Weir, bassist Phil Lesh
and pianist Keith Godchaux.
One of the most welcome
features of the new system is that
for the first time Godchaux's
piano is clearly audible, and really
a part of the whole sound. He
easily earned his night's pay with
his country-flavored solo work on
"Big River" and "Ramble On
Rose."
Weir's guitar was also more
noticeable with the present setup,
which is as much a sign of
continued evolution of what goes
into the speakers as what comes
out. And, of course, Garcia's
guitar cut as clearly as ever
through the smoky air of the Cow
Palace.
The second set continued with
"Me and My Uncle," "Bertha,"

Chuck Berry's "Around and
Around," "Wharf Rat" and
"Sugar Magnolia." The closer was
the perennial crowd pleaser,
"Casey Jones," but this time it
was a fairly restrained,
slow-simmering version. The
announcer called them for an
encore, as well as a hand for the
"madmen who built this
incredible system." The Dead
returned with "Saturday Night."
The way things used to be, a
five-hour Dead concert would
leave the audience nearly
exhausted. This time, however, it
was different, largely because of
the lowered volume. As a friend
remarked on the way out, "I'm
coming out of this concert with
more energy than I brought in."
That's the way it should be.

BRISBANE-The Grateful
Dead, who previewed a brand-new
sound system at their concert in
Maples two years ago, picked the
Cow Palace to test their newest
version March 23.
Why, one might ask, did they
need another system the
"old" model had served so well,
everywhere from Winterland to
Watkins Glen? The answer is the
continuing search by the Dead
and Alembic, their sound
contractors, for perfect fidelity in
live sound projection.
The Dead-Alembic approach
involves a sophisticated array of
powerful amps, spectrum
equalizers and sensitive speakers
which produce loud but clear,
undistorted sound. This is
achieved partly by having a huge
capacity which is never pushed to
its limits.
The newest version, heard in
February at Winterland and this
time at the Cow Palace, has one
important quality in which it
differs from its predecessors: it is
quieter. Through some sort of
acoustic-electronic wizardry,
Alembic has figured out how to
fill a large hall with
well-proportioned sound without
inflicting bodily damage on those
in the front of the audience.
In the middle of the floor, one
could hear quite well, yet talking
over the music was not only
possible, but fairly easy. Only the
vocals tended to be overpowering,
but reports from other areas of
the hall said this was not a
problem elsewhere.
In order to test their new
system, the Dead chose a fairly
standard concert program, from
new tunes to real oldies like
"Morning Dew." Typically, the
first hour or so was fairly relaxed;
after all, if you're going to do a
five-hour show, it's best to pace
yourself.
They began with a new song,
then "Promised Land,"
"Brown-Eved Women," "Mexicali
Blues," "Tennessee Jed," and
"Black Throated Wind." A couple
more new tunes followed, and a
very mellow "El Paso," then "The
Wheel," "Cassidy," "China Cat
Sunflower," "I Know You Rider"
and the "Weather Report Suite"
rounded out the set.
The energy level, though not
the volume, definitely picked up
in the second set, which began
with a 45-minute song-within-a
song-within-a-song. They went
from "Playing in the Band" to
"Uncle John's Band" to "Morning
Dew" and back again, with spacey
and spacious interstitial jams
between guitarists Jerry Garcia

and Bob Weir, bassist Phil Lesh
and pianist Keith Godchaux.
One of the most welcome
features of the new system is that
for the first time Godchaux's
piano is clearly audible, and really
a part of the whole sound. He
easily earned his night's pay with
his country-flavored solo work on
"Big River" and "Ramble On
Rose."
Weir's guitar was also more
noticeable with the present setup,
which is as much a sign of
continued evolution of what goes
into the speakers as what comes
out. And, of course, Garcia's
guitar cut as clearly as ever
through the smoky air of the Cow
Palace.
The second set continued with
"Me and My Uncle," "Bertha,"

Chuck Berry's "Around and
Around," "Wharf Rat" and
"Sugar Magnolia." The closer was
the perennial crowd pleaser,
"Casey Jones," but this time it
was a fairly restrained,
slow-simmering version. The
announcer called them for an
encore, as well as a hand for the
"madmen who built this
incredible system." The Dead
returned with "Saturday Night."
The way things used to be, a
five-hour Dead concert would
leave the audience nearly
exhausted. This time, however, it
was different, largely because of
the lowered volume. As a friend
remarked on the way out, "I'm
coming out of this concert with
more energy than I brought in."
