Midwest Tornadoes Kill 100
Tornadoes struck nine states in the Midwest and South
last night, then swirled into Canada. More than 170 people
were killed.
Hundreds of injuries also were reported as the twisters
ravaged parts of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Alabama, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina and
Canada's Ontario Province. Damage was in the millions.
Half the town of Xenia, Ohio, a community of 25,000,
was destroyed, according to the county sheriff.
Authorities counted 173 deaths and gave this
breakdown: Kentucky, 56; Indiana, 35; Ohio, 29; Illinois,
2; Alabama, 19; Tennessee, 7; Georgia, 12; Michigan, 2;
North Carolina, 3; and Windsor, Ontario, 8.
Eight persons were killed and more than 20 injured in
Windsor, Ontario, where a tornado ripped off the roof of
the local curling rink.
A moderate earthquake hit portions of the Midwest
about the same time the area was being raked by the
tornadoes. There were no reports of injuries or major
property damage from the quake which was centered in
Springfield, 111.
Prosecution Rests In Stans Case
NEW YORK — The government rested its criminal case
against John N. Mitchell and Maurice H. Stans yesterday
and the defense charged that the case against the former
Cabinet officers was a spinoff from the Watergate scandal.
Mitchell, the former attorney general, and Stans,
onetime commerce secretary, are charged with conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and perjury. They are accused of
impeding a massive Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud investigation of financier Robert L. Vesco in return
for the latter's secret $200,000 cash contribution to
President Nixon's 1972 campaign.
In midtrial motions for dismissal of the criminal
conspiracy charges against Mitchell and Stans, the defense
said it had received voluminous transcripts of grand jury
testimony by prosecution trial witnesses that it had not had
access to before.
In reference to this material, the defense claimed:
"The clear implication and thrust of the questioning was
that Vesco's contribution was requested in cash in order to
finance the Watergate break-in and other recently disclosed
political activity.
"Indeed, it is not too much to say from a review of these
various transcripts that the prosecutors in New York were

attempting to prove that very fact."
The implication was that after failing to link the Vesco
cash directly to Watergate, the government settled for its
current case against Mitchell and Stans.
Police Link Recent Slayings
SAN FRANCISCO — Police said yesterday they believe
the killer of a Salvation Army cadet also may have been
responsible for 11 other apparently motiveless street
slayings here in the past six months.
"Indications are from our investigative reports that it is
connected to the earlier slayings," a police spokesman said.
He said all 12 slayings appeared to be random,
unprovoked and without a robbery demand. A .32-caliber
weapon was used in each case. All the victims were white
and the assailant in each case was black.
However, ballistics tests showed a different .32-caliber
weapon was used in the latest slaying than in earlier killings,
including the killings of four persons and the wounding of a
fifth in January.
Chapin Denies Lying To Jury
WASHINGTON — Dwight L. Chapin, denying anew that
he lied to a federal grand jury, told his perjury trial
yesterday,"I had no reason to withhold any answers."
Chapin, the last of three defense witnesses, testified,
however, he tried to keep from the grand jury the fact that
H.R. Haldeman, the former White House chief of staff, had
approved the activities of political prankster Donald H.
Segretti.
The 33-year-old former appointments secretary to
President Nixon is charged in three counts with making
false statements when he testified last April before the
grand jury.
A fourth count — that he lied in saying he didn't know
how much Segretti was paid — was dismissed by U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell after the prosecution
rested its case.
The defense rested in late afternoon, but only after
prosecutors had won from Chapin an admission that he had
misstated facts to the FBI in two interviews.
French To Vote In Late April
PARIS — The French people will vote for a new
president to succeed Georges Pompidou on April 28 or May
5, but diplomatic analysts regard any change in basic
French positions to be unlikely.
The possible candidates to succeed Pompidou, who died
Tuesday, will wait until after the president's burial today
before making any political statements. But analysts said
they could foresee no substantial movement away from the
stance that has driven a wedge between France and the
United States and created major problems within the
European Common Market.
The French Cabinet is to meet tomorrow to decide the
election date which must come at least 20 days and not
more than 35 days after the presidency becomes vacant. If
no candidate receives an absolute majority in the first
balloting, a runoff election must be held two Sundays later.
These would fall on May 12 or 19.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with variable high
cloudiness. A little warmer days. Low tonight in low to mid
40s. Highs today in the 60s and tomorrow in the 60s and
low 70s. Light variable winds.
