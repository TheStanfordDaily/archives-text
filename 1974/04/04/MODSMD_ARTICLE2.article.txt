# Could Owe $465,000
## Nixon To Pay Taxes 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon has agreed to pay back income
taxes of $432,787.13 plus interest that
could push the total to $465,000, the
White House announced last night.
The announcement said the
Internal Revenue Service had ruled
Nixon owed the taxes on income
during his White House years, and that
the President ordered full payment
with interest.
Word of that decision came hours
after the staff of a joint congressional
committee recommended that Nixon
pay $476,431 in back taxes and
interest for the years 1969 through
1972.
A White House source said the IRS
had told Nixon there was no
suggestion of fraud, civil or criminal,
in the assessment for back taxes.
Rep. Wilbur R. Mills, D-Ark., vice
chairman of the committee,
emphasized to newsmen that the joint
committee had not passed on the
merits of the report.
Challenge Every Item
Officials said that on virtually every
challenged tax item, the IRS findings

and those of the staff of the Joint
Committee on Internal Revenue
Taxation were in agreement.
They said the different tax amounts
stemmed from differences in
calculations.
The White House said Nixon
believed his lawyers could have made a
very strong case against major
conclusions of the staff report.
Requested Examination
"However, at the time the President
voluntarily requested the committee
to conduct its examination of his tax
returns, he stated that he would abide
by the committee's judgment," the
statement said. "In view of the fact
that the staff report indicates that the
proper amount to be paid must be
determined by the Internal Revenue
Service, he has today instructed
payment of the $432,787.13 set forth
by the Internal Revenue Service, plus
interest."
A White House official said Nixon's
payment of the back tax bill would
wipe out much of his personal wealth.
The President's net worth as of Mav
31, 1973, was $988,522, according to
figures made public by the White
House in December.
IRS Audit
The IRS had announced it was
auditing Nixon's taxes, while the joint
committee had them under study at
the request of the President.
A major item at issue had been
Nixon's tax deductions for the
donation of his vice presidential
papers, appraised at $576,000, to the
government. He had deducted
$482,018 of that sum. Both the
committee and the IRS agreed that he
was not entitled to the deductions.
California Probe
Meanwhile, a California Assembly
committee launched its probe into
President Nixon's state income tax
status yesterday by ordering the state
tax board to turn over all its
information on the case.
Members of the Revenue and
Taxation Committee voted 12-0 to
authorize committee chairman Joe
Gonsalves to obtain the data from the
state Franchise Tax Board.
Three Republicans joined nine
Democrats in the request. A board
spokesman said tax officials would
comply with the order.
No State Income Taxes
The White House created a furor
Dec. 8 when it acknowledged Nixon
had paid no state income taxes since
taking office in 1969.
But state tax officials ruled in
February that the President could not
be considered a California resident for
tax purposes, despite the fact he lists
his San Clemente estate as his voting
address.

Committee on Internal Revenue
Taxation were in agreement.
They said the different tax amounts
stemmed from differences in
calculations.
The White House said Nixon
believed his lawyers could have made a
very strong case against major
conclusions of the staff report.
Requested Examination
"However, at the time the President
voluntarily requested the committee
to conduct its examination of his tax
returns, he stated that he would abide
by the committee's judgment," the
statement said. "In view of the fact
that the staff report indicates that the
proper amount to be paid must be
determined by the Internal Revenue
Service, he has today instructed
payment of the $432,787.13 set forth
by the Internal Revenue Service, plus
interest."
A White House official said Nixon's
payment of the back tax bill would
wipe out much of his personal wealth.
The President's net worth as of Mav
31, 1973, was $988,522, according to
figures made public by the White
House in December.
IRS Audit
The IRS had announced it was
auditing Nixon's taxes, while the joint
committee had them under study at
the request of the President.
A major item at issue had been
Nixon's tax deductions for the
donation of his vice presidential
papers, appraised at $576,000, to the
government. He had deducted
$482,018 of that sum. Both the
committee and the IRS agreed that he
was not entitled to the deductions.
California Probe
Meanwhile, a California Assembly
committee launched its probe into
President Nixon's state income tax
status yesterday by ordering the state
tax board to turn over all its
information on the case.
Members of the Revenue and
Taxation Committee voted 12-0 to
authorize committee chairman Joe
Gonsalves to obtain the data from the
state Franchise Tax Board.
Three Republicans joined nine
Democrats in the request. A board
spokesman said tax officials would
comply with the order.
No State Income Taxes
The White House created a furor
Dec. 8 when it acknowledged Nixon
had paid no state income taxes since
taking office in 1969.
But state tax officials ruled in
February that the President could not
be considered a California resident for
tax purposes, despite the fact he lists
his San Clemente estate as his voting
address.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon has agreed to pay back income
taxes of $432,787.13 plus interest that
could push the total to $465,000, the
White House announced last night.
The announcement said the
Internal Revenue Service had ruled
Nixon owed the taxes on income
during his White House years, and that
the President ordered full payment
with interest.
Word of that decision came hours
after the staff of a joint congressional
committee recommended that Nixon
pay $476,431 in back taxes and
interest for the years 1969 through
1972.
A White House source said the IRS
had told Nixon there was no
suggestion of fraud, civil or criminal,
in the assessment for back taxes.
Rep. Wilbur R. Mills, D-Ark., vice
chairman of the committee,
emphasized to newsmen that the joint
committee had not passed on the
merits of the report.
Challenge Every Item
Officials said that on virtually every
challenged tax item, the IRS findings

and those of the staff of the Joint
Committee on Internal Revenue
Taxation were in agreement.
They said the different tax amounts
stemmed from differences in
calculations.
