# Berk Claims USE Strike Near
## 
### DON COX 
Jim Berk, president of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union told
the Daily earlier this week that the
union "is headed for a strike" because
"management is not responsive" to
our demands.
USE's bargaining unit, engaged in
contract negotiations with the
University since December, suspended
negotiations March 28 to allow the
negotiating team to report back to the
unit, said Berk.
The union has scheduled' a meeting
for noon April 11 at Tresidder where
the negotiating team will brief unit
members on the University's offer.
"We're going back to our
constituency and tell them we've done
the best we can to get management's
best offer. We've exhausted any
fruitful [courses of negotiation] and
the major issues are still at stake,"
Berk said.
Berk stated the unit can accept or
reject management's offer. He
"predicted" that the unit would reject

the offer and send the negotiating
team back to the bargaining table
strengthened by the threat of a strike
if the union's demands are not met.

"The [union] organization will
back me up with the threat of a
strike," Berk said. "While the unit is
not anxious for a strike, the present
proposals will provoke one," he added.
Berk said he does not expect any
immediate compromises by the
University when they return to the
table, but the approaching advent of a
strike would force the University to
compromise.
"We're inevitably moving toward a
strike. It all depends on how fast the
University makes compromises. They
may for may not] come soon enough
to prevent an actual [walkout]," he
continued.
Berk said that he saw "no signs of
disunity in the union. It's gotten to
the point where guys who can't afford
to go out on strike will.
[Management's] concessions are

barely a drop in the bucket." The
union has less than $2000, which
would not go far in the way of strike
benefits, he noted.
There are about 300 people in the
union who are not in the bargaining
unit, some of whom are worried about
a strike, added Berk.
Douglas Barton, head of the
University negotiating team, has said
that the union must become more
realistic concerning the overall cost of
the settlement. Barton also
commented that the union has made
no concessions on their economic
proposal during negotiations.
The University has also expressed
the desire to continue negotiating
sessions but Berk said that the union
negotiators needed the time to prepare
for the coming meeting with the unit
members.
Among the main sticking points in
the negotiations have been a cost of
living escalator clause and wage
increases the union has included in
their proposed contract.
