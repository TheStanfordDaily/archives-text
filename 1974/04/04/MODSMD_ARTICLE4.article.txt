# Pakistan's Ambassador Expresses Hope
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
A visit by Sahabzada Yaqub Khan,
Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S.,
highlighted yesterday's "Pakistan
Day" celebration at the University.
Khan spoke both after a dinner at the
International Center and earlier at a
press conference. The event was a
belated celebration of Pakistan's
March 23 national holiday sponsored
by the Stanford Pakistan society.
"Pakistan now is successfully
picking up the pieces after the
disastrous floods and war of 1971,"
said Khan in a Bishop Auditorium
speech last night. "The recent
recognition of Bangla Desh shows that
we are willing to take great steps to
promote good relations with our
neighbors.
"This recognition was a painful
experience for the average Pakistani: it
took great statesmanship and courage
for Prime Minister Bhutto to make
such a move," he noted.
At an afternoon tea and conference
at the Hoover Institution, Khan lauded
the People's Republic of China,
Pakistan's ally. "I can think of no
other country which can treat its allies
with the trust and patience that China
uses. We stood by them when they
were alone and cut off, and today we
have no more understanding ally," he
stated.
"I hope we have ended our long
chapter of conflict with India," said
the ambassador. "We have been hostile
for 700 years, perhaps the longest

continuous conflict in recorded
history. Today the prisoner-of-war
issue from the 1971 war is almost
completely resolved, and some 76
thousand prisoners have returned to
their homes. We hope this settlement
will be the first step toward healthy
relations with India."
Khan emphasized his nation's
feelings of solidarity with the Arab
nations: "Our Islamic faith is more
than a religion: it is a way of life
which gives all Moslem countries a
sense of identity. We supported the
whole Middle-East bloc long before
the oil crisis, and today our relations
with the Arabs are strong."
Discussing the breakaway state of
Bangla Desh, the ambassador stated,
"This small country has a fear, almost
a psychosis, against forming alliances
with large nations. They have been
cool towards India: the feeling is
justified because the Hindus exploited
the Bengalis for a long time before
Pakistan became independent. Their
mistrust of West Pakistan is less
justified."
Khan termed the Indian experience
with democracy and old-line socialism
"a failure." He added, "Pakistan has
now reverted to the democratic
experiment, but we will not repeat
India's mistakes."
Other events on the "Pakistan Day"
program included Pakistani dinner at
the Bechtel International Center, and
Pakistani films and entertainment at
Bishop Auditorium.

Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S.,
highlighted yesterday's "Pakistan
Day" celebration at the University.
Khan spoke both after a dinner at the
International Center and earlier at a
press conference. The event was a
belated celebration of Pakistan's
March 23 national holiday sponsored
by the Stanford Pakistan society.
"Pakistan now is successfully
picking up the pieces after the
disastrous floods and war of 1971,"
said Khan in a Bishop Auditorium
speech last night. "The recent
recognition of Bangla Desh shows that
we are willing to take great steps to
promote good relations with our
neighbors.
"This recognition was a painful
experience for the average Pakistani: it
took great statesmanship and courage
for Prime Minister Bhutto to make
such a move," he noted.
At an afternoon tea and conference
at the Hoover Institution, Khan lauded
the People's Republic of China,
Pakistan's ally. "I can think of no
other country which can treat its allies
with the trust and patience that China
uses. We stood by them when they
were alone and cut off, and today we
have no more understanding ally," he
stated.
"I hope we have ended our long
chapter of conflict with India," said
the ambassador. "We have been hostile
for 700 years, perhaps the longest

continuous conflict in recorded
history. Today the prisoner-of-war
issue from the 1971 war is almost
completely resolved, and some 76
thousand prisoners have returned to
their homes. We hope this settlement
will be the first step toward healthy
relations with India."
Khan emphasized his nation's
feelings of solidarity with the Arab
nations: "Our Islamic faith is more
than a religion: it is a way of life
which gives all Moslem countries a
sense of identity. We supported the
whole Middle-East bloc long before
the oil crisis, and today our relations
with the Arabs are strong."
Discussing the breakaway state of
Bangla Desh, the ambassador stated,
"This small country has a fear, almost
a psychosis, against forming alliances
with large nations. They have been
cool towards India: the feeling is
justified because the Hindus exploited
the Bengalis for a long time before
Pakistan became independent. Their
mistrust of West Pakistan is less
justified."
Khan termed the Indian experience
with democracy and old-line socialism
"a failure." He added, "Pakistan has
now reverted to the democratic
experiment, but we will not repeat
India's mistakes."
Other events on the "Pakistan Day"
program included Pakistani dinner at
the Bechtel International Center, and
Pakistani films and entertainment at
Bishop Auditorium.
