# Lt. Gov. Reinecke Indicted On Three Perjury Counts
## 
### 
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, a GOP
gubernatorial candidate, was indicted
yesterday by a federal grand jury on
three counts of perjury in the
investigation of the International
Telephone and Telegraph case.
Reinecke insists that he will remain
in the race for governor despite the
indictment. "I intend to go forward. I
am innocent," he told a news
conference in Sacramento yesterday.
Reinecke predicted that he will win
the June primary and the November
election.
Reinecke was indicted on three
counts of lying in sworn testimony
April 19, 1972 before the U.S. Senate
Judiciary Committee during hearings
on the nomination of former Atty.
Gen. Richard Kleindienst.
Reinecke was charged with lying to
the Committee about when he first
discussed bringing the 1972
Republican National Convention to
San Diego and lying about when he
discovered that the Sheraton Corp.
had offered the GOP money to hold
the convention in San Diego.
The convention originally was
scheduled for San Diego, but later was
moved to Miami Beach after reports
that ITT and its subsidiary had offered
the Republicans $400,000 to pay
some of the costs of the convention in
return for the settlement of an ITT
antitrust suit.
The suit was settled on July 31,
1971. The questions the Committee
asked Reinecke concentrated on
whether he told then Atty. Gen. John

Mitchell about the ITT offer before or
after the settlement.
Reinecke is quoted as saying he
told Mitchell about the offer during
September 1971 face-to-face meeting.
Reinecke later admitted he told
Mitchell about the pledge in a
telephone conversation in June. He
excused the discrepancy by claiming
that the Committee asked him only
about meetings, not telephone
conversations.
The White House says that the
antitrust settlement and the selection
of San Diego as a convention site were
unrelated. According to the White
House, the cash bid was committed by
the Sheraton Corp. by June 1, 1971,
two months before the settlement
with ITT was agreed upon.

Reinecke was also indicted for
telling the committee that the plan to
attract the GOP to San Diego was not
made until April of 1972.
Each count of perjury carries a
maximum penalty of five years in
prison, or a fine of $2000 or both,
upon conviction.
Reinecke instructed his attorneys
to seek a change of venue so that the
trial will be held in California, claiming
that he couldn't receive a fair trial in
Washington. He asked the trial be held
before the June 4 primary.
Reinecke was appointed to the No.
2 position in the state by Gov. Reagan
in 1969 to replace Robert Finch, who
was named to Nixon's cabinet.
Reinecke won a term in his own right
in the 1970 election.

Reinecke was indicted on three
counts of lying in sworn testimony
April 19, 1972 before the U.S. Senate
Judiciary Committee during hearings
on the nomination of former Atty.
Gen. Richard Kleindienst.
Reinecke was charged with lying to
the Committee about when he first
discussed bringing the 1972
Republican National Convention to
San Diego and lying about when he
discovered that the Sheraton Corp.
had offered the GOP money to hold
the convention in San Diego.
The convention originally was
scheduled for San Diego, but later was
moved to Miami Beach after reports
that ITT and its subsidiary had offered
the Republicans $400,000 to pay
some of the costs of the convention in
return for the settlement of an ITT
antitrust suit.
The suit was settled on July 31,
1971. The questions the Committee
asked Reinecke concentrated on
whether he told then Atty. Gen. John

Mitchell about the ITT offer before or
after the settlement.
Reinecke is quoted as saying he
told Mitchell about the offer during
September 1971 face-to-face meeting.
Reinecke later admitted he told
Mitchell about the pledge in a
telephone conversation in June. He
excused the discrepancy by claiming
that the Committee asked him only
about meetings, not telephone
conversations.
The White House says that the
antitrust settlement and the selection
of San Diego as a convention site were
unrelated. According to the White
House, the cash bid was committed by
the Sheraton Corp. by June 1, 1971,
two months before the settlement
with ITT was agreed upon.

Reinecke was also indicted for
telling the committee that the plan to
attract the GOP to San Diego was not
made until April of 1972.
Each count of perjury carries a
maximum penalty of five years in
prison, or a fine of $2000 or both,
upon conviction.
Reinecke instructed his attorneys
to seek a change of venue so that the
trial will be held in California, claiming
that he couldn't receive a fair trial in
Washington. He asked the trial be held
before the June 4 primary.
Reinecke was appointed to the No.
2 position in the state by Gov. Reagan
in 1969 to replace Robert Finch, who
was named to Nixon's cabinet.
Reinecke won a term in his own right
in the 1970 election.
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, a GOP
gubernatorial candidate, was indicted
yesterday by a federal grand jury on
three counts of perjury in the
investigation of the International
Telephone and Telegraph case.
Reinecke insists that he will remain
in the race for governor despite the
indictment. "I intend to go forward. I
am innocent," he told a news
conference in Sacramento yesterday.
Reinecke predicted that he will win
the June primary and the November
election.
