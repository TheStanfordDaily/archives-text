# Energy Use Down, But Costs Still Rise
## 
### TERRY ANZUR Last of three parts 
During the first four months of a
campus energy conservation effort
that began Nov. 1, Stanford used 20
percent less electricity and fuel than
during the same period of 1972-73 —
and still paid PG&E five percent more
than it did last year.
For the past five years, the
University's energy use level has
increased by nine percent each year.
Conservation moves have stemmed the
yearly consumption rise, but plant
services director Dan DeYoung expects
utility costs to rise 15-20 percent
annually in the near future.
Although the actual amount of fuel
and electricity saved between Nov. 1
and Feb. 20 equals roughly $167,000,
that figure appears insignificant beside
the University's $215 million
operating budget, DeYoung points
out. "We couldn't have sold the
conservation program on the basis of
dollars saved," he says."The selling
point is the saving in resources."
The bulk of Stanford's projected
$2.5 million total energy bill
represents natural gas and electricity
purchased from PG&E. Because
University steam boilers eat up
200,000 cubic feet of natural gas per
day, Stanford is classified as a large
commercial user and required to
contract for interruptible service.
Priorities
The industrial users rank third on
PG&E's priority list; after the needs of
PG&E electricity generators and
homeowners are met, large industrials
may buy what gas is left at a greatly
reduced rate.
Political pressure and increasing
national demand have reduced the
flow of natural gas from PG&E's major
sources in Canada and Texas. Last
summer, in anticipation of winter gas
shortages, PG&E warned large
industrials that there would be days
when gas would be unavailable at any
price.
That's when the energy crisis came
to Stanford.
Forewarning Signs
Eight months ago, DeYoung knew

that under normal weather conditions
Stanford could expect five gasless days
in 1973-74. But it wasn't until he
noticed the old country warning signs
of a particularly harsh winter ahead —
that the caterpillers were growing
more fuzzy and that Stanford squirrels
sported bushier tails — that he
launched Stanford's commitment to
conserve energy in an inevitable
confrontation with the energy crisis.
Realizing that Stanford had
received a 135,000 gallon allocation of
backup oil, sufficient to run the steam
plant for only about five days,
DeYoung began to set up priorities of
his own. Until government regulators
increased the backup allocation to
330,000 gallons, he was prepared, if
necessary, to shut off heat to all
University buildings except the
hospital, the student health center,
and an apartment complex where
families with small children live.
He announced weekend heating
shutdowns for all unnecessary
academic buildings, a move which
reduced weekend energy- consumption
by an average of 20 percent. Students
working in the Storke Publications
Building during Thanksgiving vacation
iearned to type with mittens on, as a
four-day recess shutdown represented
an additional 20 percent cut.
More Cutbacks
Other important conservation
moves were:
— an unprecedented decision to
close, lock, and shut off heat and
electricity in nearly all undergraduate
housing during Christmas recess, Dec.
15-Jan. 4. Fuel use was cut by nearly
one-third during that time;
— rescheduling of night-time
custodial work to daytime hours;
— elimination of all decorative
lighting and shutdowns of decorative
fountain water pumps;
— additional maintenance to keep
utility systems in top shape.
PG&E has actually shut off the
University's gas supply for only two
days so far, one of them during an
academic recess. Because DeYoung
now has enough oil on hand to provide
essential heating services for at least
seven days, the situation, at least
temporarily, is no longer crucial.
No Guarantee
However, the increased oil
allocation is no guarantee that
DeYoung will be able to find an
independent dealer who will sell the
University its full allowance, and the
price of a barrel of oil has nearly
tripled (from 11 cents to 31 cents)
during the past year. "We don't want
to use oil unless we absolutely have
to," DeYoung stresses. "It costs three
times as much to heat with oil rather
than with gas, so economically, gas is
much more efficient."
Based on normal winter weather
conditions PG&E plans to interrupt

Stanford gas service for 21 days in
1974-75 and an estimated 55 days in
1975-76.
Such bleak predictions have
modified the University's attitude
toward energy use. The new Terman
engineering building will be
constructed with thick, windowless
concrete walls on one or more sides,
and possibly incorporate solar energy
technology.
New Possibilities
A University committee has
investigated the possibility that
Stanford might become a "total
energy" utility in its own right in the
distant future. DeYoung is certain that
any new campus fuel use proposals
will involve fossil fuels rather than
nuclear power or other new energy
technologies.
However, the cost of "total energy"
is prohibitive; researchers estimated
that the cost of such a system for
Harvard and neighboring schools at
more than $27 million. Even if
Stanford could afford such a capital
outlay, "total energy" would not
guarantee energy self-sufficiency — the
University would still have to purchase
fossil fuels from an outside source.
Alternately, the University could
increase energy supplies by
maximizing the efficiency of existing
steam plant facilities. But a
modification to increase the efficiency
of the steam plant by five percent for

natural gas requires a capital outlay of
$300,000. As natural gas supplies
dwindle and the University plant
produces more steam from oil, new
technologies for increasing its
efficiency for oil use will gain
significance.
Plant services received only
12,000 gallons of tax-free gasoline
after requesting 15,000 gallons to fuel
police cars, fire engines, and utility
vehicles during the month of March.
When that runs out, campus policemen
will be joining Stanford students at
crowded gas stations along El
Camino, DeYoung says, noting that
emergency vehicles have immediate
priority over passenger cars.
In another recent transportation
energy-saving move, the University has
backed a RIDES for Bay Area
Commuters effort to organize
Stanford employees into carpools.
'Snap Decisions'
In the meantime, Stanford's
"energy czar" will determine
University energy use policies "by
making snap decisions," DeYoung
says.
And Stanford energy conservers can
rest easy in the knowledge that in four
months, they have helped save an
amount of energy equivalent to
one-400th of the nation's daily oil
consumption, or enough "juice" to
keep an exceptional 60-watt lightbulb
burning for at least 60,000 years.

However, the increased oil
allocation is no guarantee that
DeYoung will be able to find an
independent dealer who will sell the
University its full allowance, and the
price of a barrel of oil has nearly
tripled (from 11 cents to 31 cents)
during the past year. "We don't want
to use oil unless we absolutely have
to," DeYoung stresses. "It costs three
times as much to heat with oil rather
than with gas, so economically, gas is
much more efficient."
Based on normal winter weather
conditions PG&E plans to interrupt

Stanford gas service for 21 days in
1974-75 and an estimated 55 days in
1975-76.
Such bleak predictions have
modified the University's attitude
toward energy use. The new Terman
engineering building will be
constructed with thick, windowless
concrete walls on one or more sides,
and possibly incorporate solar energy
technology.
New Possibilities
A University committee has
investigated the possibility that
Stanford might become a "total
energy" utility in its own right in the
distant future. DeYoung is certain that
any new campus fuel use proposals
will involve fossil fuels rather than
nuclear power or other new energy
technologies.
However, the cost of "total energy"
is prohibitive; researchers estimated
that the cost of such a system for
Harvard and neighboring schools at
more than $27 million. Even if
Stanford could afford such a capital
outlay, "total energy" would not
guarantee energy self-sufficiency — the
University would still have to purchase
fossil fuels from an outside source.
Alternately, the University could
increase energy supplies by
maximizing the efficiency of existing
steam plant facilities. But a
modification to increase the efficiency
of the steam plant by five percent for

natural gas requires a capital outlay of
$300,000. As natural gas supplies
dwindle and the University plant
produces more steam from oil, new
technologies for increasing its
efficiency for oil use will gain
significance.
Plant services received only
12,000 gallons of tax-free gasoline
after requesting 15,000 gallons to fuel
police cars, fire engines, and utility
vehicles during the month of March.
When that runs out, campus policemen
will be joining Stanford students at
crowded gas stations along El
Camino, DeYoung says, noting that
emergency vehicles have immediate
priority over passenger cars.
In another recent transportation
energy-saving move, the University has
backed a RIDES for Bay Area
Commuters effort to organize
Stanford employees into carpools.
'Snap Decisions'
In the meantime, Stanford's
"energy czar" will determine
University energy use policies "by
making snap decisions," DeYoung
says.
And Stanford energy conservers can
rest easy in the knowledge that in four
months, they have helped save an
amount of energy equivalent to
one-400th of the nation's daily oil
consumption, or enough "juice" to
keep an exceptional 60-watt lightbulb
burning for at least 60,000 years.
During the first four months of a
campus energy conservation effort
that began Nov. 1, Stanford used 20
percent less electricity and fuel than
during the same period of 1972-73 —
and still paid PG&E five percent more
than it did last year.
For the past five years, the
University's energy use level has
increased by nine percent each year.
Conservation moves have stemmed the
yearly consumption rise, but plant
services director Dan DeYoung expects
utility costs to rise 15-20 percent
annually in the near future.
Although the actual amount of fuel
and electricity saved between Nov. 1
and Feb. 20 equals roughly $167,000,
that figure appears insignificant beside
the University's $215 million
operating budget, DeYoung points
out. "We couldn't have sold the
conservation program on the basis of
dollars saved," he says."The selling
point is the saving in resources."
The bulk of Stanford's projected
$2.5 million total energy bill
represents natural gas and electricity
purchased from PG&E. Because
University steam boilers eat up
200,000 cubic feet of natural gas per
day, Stanford is classified as a large
commercial user and required to
contract for interruptible service.
Priorities
The industrial users rank third on
PG&E's priority list; after the needs of
PG&E electricity generators and
homeowners are met, large industrials
may buy what gas is left at a greatly
reduced rate.
Political pressure and increasing
national demand have reduced the
flow of natural gas from PG&E's major
sources in Canada and Texas. Last
summer, in anticipation of winter gas
shortages, PG&E warned large
industrials that there would be days
when gas would be unavailable at any
price.
That's when the energy crisis came
to Stanford.
Forewarning Signs
Eight months ago, DeYoung knew

that under normal weather conditions
Stanford could expect five gasless days
in 1973-74. But it wasn't until he
noticed the old country warning signs
of a particularly harsh winter ahead —
that the caterpillers were growing
more fuzzy and that Stanford squirrels
sported bushier tails — that he
launched Stanford's commitment to
conserve energy in an inevitable
confrontation with the energy crisis.
Realizing that Stanford had
received a 135,000 gallon allocation of
backup oil, sufficient to run the steam
plant for only about five days,
DeYoung began to set up priorities of
his own. Until government regulators
increased the backup allocation to
330,000 gallons, he was prepared, if
necessary, to shut off heat to all
University buildings except the
hospital, the student health center,
and an apartment complex where
families with small children live.
He announced weekend heating
shutdowns for all unnecessary
academic buildings, a move which
reduced weekend energy- consumption
by an average of 20 percent. Students
working in the Storke Publications
Building during Thanksgiving vacation
iearned to type with mittens on, as a
four-day recess shutdown represented
an additional 20 percent cut.
More Cutbacks
Other important conservation
moves were:
— an unprecedented decision to
close, lock, and shut off heat and
electricity in nearly all undergraduate
housing during Christmas recess, Dec.
15-Jan. 4. Fuel use was cut by nearly
one-third during that time;
— rescheduling of night-time
custodial work to daytime hours;
— elimination of all decorative
lighting and shutdowns of decorative
fountain water pumps;
— additional maintenance to keep
utility systems in top shape.
PG&E has actually shut off the
University's gas supply for only two
days so far, one of them during an
academic recess. Because DeYoung
now has enough oil on hand to provide
essential heating services for at least
seven days, the situation, at least
temporarily, is no longer crucial.

However, the increased oil
allocation is no guarantee that
DeYoung will be able to find an

point is the saving in resources."
The bulk of Stanford's projected
$2.5 million total energy bill
represents natural gas and electricity
purchased from PG&E. Because
University steam boilers eat up
200,000 cubic feet of natural gas per
day, Stanford is classified as a large
commercial user and required to
contract for interruptible service.
Priorities
The industrial users rank third on
PG&E's priority list; after the needs of
PG&E electricity generators and
homeowners are met, large industrials
may buy what gas is left at a greatly
reduced rate.
Political pressure and increasing
national demand have reduced the
flow of natural gas from PG&E's major
sources in Canada and Texas. Last
summer, in anticipation of winter gas
shortages, PG&E warned large
industrials that there would be days
when gas would be unavailable at any
price.
That's when the energy crisis came
to Stanford.
Forewarning Signs
Eight months ago, DeYoung knew

that under normal weather conditions
Stanford could expect five gasless days
in 1973-74. But it wasn't until he
noticed the old country warning signs
of a particularly harsh winter ahead —
that the caterpillers were growing
more fuzzy and that Stanford squirrels
sported bushier tails — that he
launched Stanford's commitment to
conserve energy in an inevitable
confrontation with the energy crisis.
Realizing that Stanford had
received a 135,000 gallon allocation of
backup oil, sufficient to run the steam
plant for only about five days,
DeYoung began to set up priorities of
his own. Until government regulators
increased the backup allocation to
330,000 gallons, he was prepared, if
necessary, to shut off heat to all
University buildings except the
hospital, the student health center,
and an apartment complex where
families with small children live.
He announced weekend heating
shutdowns for all unnecessary
academic buildings, a move which
reduced weekend energy- consumption
by an average of 20 percent. Students
working in the Storke Publications
Building during Thanksgiving vacation
iearned to type with mittens on, as a
four-day recess shutdown represented
an additional 20 percent cut.
More Cutbacks
Other important conservation
moves were:
— an unprecedented decision to
close, lock, and shut off heat and
electricity in nearly all undergraduate
housing during Christmas recess, Dec.
15-Jan. 4. Fuel use was cut by nearly
one-third during that time;
— rescheduling of night-time
custodial work to daytime hours;
— elimination of all decorative
lighting and shutdowns of decorative
fountain water pumps;
— additional maintenance to keep
utility systems in top shape.
PG&E has actually shut off the
University's gas supply for only two
days so far, one of them during an
academic recess. Because DeYoung
now has enough oil on hand to provide
essential heating services for at least
seven days, the situation, at least
temporarily, is no longer crucial.
No Guarantee
However, the increased oil
allocation is no guarantee that
DeYoung will be able to find an
independent dealer who will sell the
University its full allowance, and the
price of a barrel of oil has nearly
tripled (from 11 cents to 31 cents)
during the past year. "We don't want
to use oil unless we absolutely have
to," DeYoung stresses. "It costs three
times as much to heat with oil rather
than with gas, so economically, gas is
much more efficient."
Based on normal winter weather
conditions PG&E plans to interrupt

Stanford gas service for 21 days in
1974-75 and an estimated 55 days in
1975-76.
Such bleak predictions have
modified the University's attitude
toward energy use. The new Terman
engineering building will be
constructed with thick, windowless
concrete walls on one or more sides,
and possibly incorporate solar energy
technology.
New Possibilities
A University committee has
investigated the possibility that
Stanford might become a "total
energy" utility in its own right in the
distant future. DeYoung is certain that
any new campus fuel use proposals
will involve fossil fuels rather than
nuclear power or other new energy
technologies.
However, the cost of "total energy"
is prohibitive; researchers estimated
that the cost of such a system for
Harvard and neighboring schools at
more than $27 million. Even if
Stanford could afford such a capital
outlay, "total energy" would not
guarantee energy self-sufficiency — the
University would still have to purchase
fossil fuels from an outside source.
Alternately, the University could
increase energy supplies by
maximizing the efficiency of existing
steam plant facilities. But a
modification to increase the efficiency
of the steam plant by five percent for

natural gas requires a capital outlay of
$300,000. As natural gas supplies
dwindle and the University plant
produces more steam from oil, new
technologies for increasing its
efficiency for oil use will gain
significance.
Plant services received only
12,000 gallons of tax-free gasoline
after requesting 15,000 gallons to fuel
police cars, fire engines, and utility
vehicles during the month of March.
When that runs out, campus policemen
will be joining Stanford students at
crowded gas stations along El
Camino, DeYoung says, noting that
emergency vehicles have immediate
priority over passenger cars.
In another recent transportation
energy-saving move, the University has
backed a RIDES for Bay Area
Commuters effort to organize
Stanford employees into carpools.
'Snap Decisions'
In the meantime, Stanford's
"energy czar" will determine
University energy use policies "by
making snap decisions," DeYoung
says.
And Stanford energy conservers can
rest easy in the knowledge that in four
months, they have helped save an
amount of energy equivalent to
one-400th of the nation's daily oil
consumption, or enough "juice" to
keep an exceptional 60-watt lightbulb
burning for at least 60,000 years.
During the first four months of a
campus energy conservation effort
that began Nov. 1, Stanford used 20
percent less electricity and fuel than
during the same period of 1972-73 —
and still paid PG&E five percent more
than it did last year.
For the past five years, the
University's energy use level has
increased by nine percent each year.
Conservation moves have stemmed the
yearly consumption rise, but plant
services director Dan DeYoung expects
utility costs to rise 15-20 percent
annually in the near future.
Although the actual amount of fuel
and electricity saved between Nov. 1
and Feb. 20 equals roughly $167,000,
that figure appears insignificant beside
the University's $215 million
operating budget, DeYoung points
out. "We couldn't have sold the
conservation program on the basis of
dollars saved," he says."The selling
point is the saving in resources."

New Possibilities
A University committee has
investigated the possibility that
Stanford might become a "total
energy" utility in its own right in the
distant future. DeYoung is certain that
any new campus fuel use proposals
will involve fossil fuels rather than
nuclear power or other new energy
technologies.
However, the cost of "total energy"
is prohibitive; researchers estimated
that the cost of such a system for
Harvard and neighboring schools at
more than $27 million. Even if
Stanford could afford such a capital
outlay, "total energy" would not
guarantee energy self-sufficiency — the
University would still have to purchase
fossil fuels from an outside source.
Alternately, the University could
increase energy supplies by
maximizing the efficiency of existing
steam plant facilities. But a
modification to increase the efficiency
of the steam plant by five percent for

natural gas requires a capital outlay of
$300,000. As natural gas supplies
dwindle and the University plant
produces more steam from oil, new
technologies for increasing its
efficiency for oil use will gain
significance.
Plant services received only
12,000 gallons of tax-free gasoline
after requesting 15,000 gallons to fuel
police cars, fire engines, and utility
vehicles during the month of March.
When that runs out, campus policemen
will be joining Stanford students at
crowded gas stations along El
Camino, DeYoung says, noting that
emergency vehicles have immediate
priority over passenger cars.
In another recent transportation
energy-saving move, the University has
backed a RIDES for Bay Area
Commuters effort to organize
Stanford employees into carpools.
'Snap Decisions'
In the meantime, Stanford's
"energy czar" will determine
University energy use policies "by
making snap decisions," DeYoung
says.
And Stanford energy conservers can
rest easy in the knowledge that in four
months, they have helped save an
amount of energy equivalent to
one-400th of the nation's daily oil
consumption, or enough "juice" to
keep an exceptional 60-watt lightbulb
burning for at least 60,000 years.
