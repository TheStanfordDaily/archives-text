# Checks On Gov't

Paul McCloskey

March 14 was a big day for the
House, and I think for those
interested in freedom of
information as well.
That morning the Government
Operations Committee reported
out, by a vote of 25-16, a bill
which effectively ends executive
privilege.
You will recall that only a year
ago Attorney General Kleindienst
stated that despite the Freedom
of Information Act, the Executive
had an absolute privilege of
withholding information from the
Congress and that the only
congressional remedy was that of
impeachment.
The key language of H.R.
12462, which is enclosed, is found
on page four where the claim of
executive privilege is made subject
to judicial resoltuion, with an
absolute obligation for delivery of
information to the Congress, save
when the court finds a
"compelling national interest"
favoring non-disclosure.
Also on March 14 the House
passed overwhelmingly (by a vote
of 338 to 8) H.R. 12471,
materially strengthening the
Freedom of Information Act,
requiring disclosure of
information by governmental
agencies.
Perhaps the key provision is

one which I added in the
subcommittee hearings, granting
attorneys' fees against a
governmental agency which
wrongfully withholds information
from a member of the public.
This language is found on page
three of the bill at lines 21-25. It
should materially assist newsmen
in obtaining release of
information from local agencies
and bureaus which have often
been reluctant to embarrass their
superiors in Washington.
My subcommittee on
Government Information has been
working on both of these bills for
over three years. In my judgment,
they represent a major step
forward in re-establishing a proper
check and balance relationship
between Congress, the Executive
Branch and the public.
We have a considerable way to
go in getting the Executive
Privilege bill through the Rules"
Committee and then the full
House (it was opposed by
Chairman Holifield and 16 of the
22 Democrats who voted,
including Leo Ryan), but I am
hopeful that we will be successful
in getting the bill enacted into law
before the end of this session.
