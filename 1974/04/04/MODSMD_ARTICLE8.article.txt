KZSU Power
Editor:
We at KFJC thought you might
be interested in the reasons why
we filed an objection with the
FCC against KZSU's proposed
power increase.
In January ol' last year, KFJC
representatives visited and
telephoned KZSU's studios to
discuss KZSU's proposal for
stereo and an amplified signal.
(This was simply to provide KFJC
with information; the possibility
of an objection had never been
raised at KFJC.)
They discussed the matter first
with a few of KZSU's engineers.
Cordiality seemed to prevail
during that first meeting.
However, the matter was then
discussed with Mr. Mark
Lawrence, Chief Engineer, and
Mr. Lloyd Snook, Station
Manager, KZSU. The combined
attitudes of Messrs. Snook and
Lawrence was one of
presumptious and rude arrogance.
Showing what we would
characterize as an appalling lack
of diplomacy, they made
statements to the effect that if
KFJC attempted to obstruct the
application process, they (KFJC)
would be "stepped on."
There were essentially three
factors taken into consideration:
(1) the adverse effects of KZSU's
proposed amplified signal on
KFJC's coverage; (2) the survival
of KFJC as a licensee, inasmuch as
a fifty percent (50%) budget cut
by the Foothill District Governing
Board appeared imminent at the
time; and (3) the attitudes of
KZSU station officials regarding
their general policy toward KFJC.
Needless to say, a decision was
reached to file the objection. And
it is clear, in retrospect, that the
attitudes of KZSU's management
was the deciding factor.
At this date, it is not our
contention that KZSU will never
be permitted to amplify its signal.
We are, in fact, looking at possible
roads of negotiation, keeping in
mind: (1) the actual effects of the
amplified signal, and (2) past and
present relationships with KZSU's
management. However, we refuse

to deal with the likes of Messrs.
Lawrence and Snook.
Further, we believe that an
amplification of KZSU's signal at
a time when a top-forty-request
format is in effect would
constitute a disservice to the
educational-FM radio audience.
In consideration of these
prerequisites to negotiation, we
look forward to reaching an
amicable agreement.

• On March 14, a story appeared
in the Daily on the end of
identification cards with the
student's photograph on them.
The story quoted Registrar Sally
Mahoney as saying that the
picture IDs were instituted four
years ago to facilitate student
identification by libraries, the
athletic department, the campus
bank, bookstore, and food
services.
In fact in 1970 there was no
bank on campus and the food
services had their own separate
photo IDs. The real reason for the
switch to photo IDs in 1970 was
to facilitate the clear classification
of students and non-students
during night-time anti-war
protests.
In the spring of 1970, riot
police would stop those out at
night and "card" them (i.e.,
demand identification). The
University identification card for
students at that time was a
stamped piece of cardboard with
the student's signature on it. It
could easily be loaned to someone
else.
During the summer of 1970,
Engineering Prof. Peter Z.
Bulkley, then dean of students,
thought up several measures to aid
the police. One was student photo
IDs with a never-implemented
separate file of the photographs to
be kept for identification of
suspects by the police.

Needless to say, a decision was
reached to file the objection. And
it is clear, in retrospect, that the
attitudes of KZSU's management
was the deciding factor.
At this date, it is not our
contention that KZSU will never
be permitted to amplify its signal.
We are, in fact, looking at possible
roads of negotiation, keeping in
mind: (1) the actual effects of the
amplified signal, and (2) past and
present relationships with KZSU's
management. However, we refuse

to deal with the likes of Messrs.
Lawrence and Snook.
Further, we believe that an
amplification of KZSU's signal at
a time when a top-forty-request
format is in effect would
constitute a disservice to the
educational-FM radio audience.
In consideration of these
prerequisites to negotiation, we
look forward to reaching an
amicable agreement.

• On March 14, a story appeared
in the Daily on the end of
identification cards with the
student's photograph on them.
The story quoted Registrar Sally
Mahoney as saying that the
picture IDs were instituted four
years ago to facilitate student
identification by libraries, the
athletic department, the campus
bank, bookstore, and food
services.
In fact in 1970 there was no
bank on campus and the food
services had their own separate
photo IDs. The real reason for the
switch to photo IDs in 1970 was
to facilitate the clear classification
of students and non-students
during night-time anti-war
protests.
In the spring of 1970, riot
police would stop those out at
night and "card" them (i.e.,
demand identification). The
University identification card for
students at that time was a
stamped piece of cardboard with
the student's signature on it. It
could easily be loaned to someone
else.
During the summer of 1970,
Engineering Prof. Peter Z.
Bulkley, then dean of students,
thought up several measures to aid
the police. One was student photo
IDs with a never-implemented
separate file of the photographs to
be kept for identification of
suspects by the police.

We at KFJC thought you might
be interested in the reasons why
we filed an objection with the
FCC against KZSU's proposed
power increase.
In January ol' last year, KFJC
representatives visited and
telephoned KZSU's studios to
discuss KZSU's proposal for
stereo and an amplified signal.
(This was simply to provide KFJC
with information; the possibility
of an objection had never been
raised at KFJC.)
They discussed the matter first
with a few of KZSU's engineers.
Cordiality seemed to prevail
during that first meeting.
However, the matter was then
discussed with Mr. Mark
Lawrence, Chief Engineer, and
Mr. Lloyd Snook, Station
Manager, KZSU. The combined
attitudes of Messrs. Snook and
Lawrence was one of
presumptious and rude arrogance.
Showing what we would
characterize as an appalling lack
of diplomacy, they made
statements to the effect that if
KFJC attempted to obstruct the
application process, they (KFJC)
would be "stepped on."
There were essentially three
factors taken into consideration:
(1) the adverse effects of KZSU's
proposed amplified signal on
KFJC's coverage; (2) the survival
of KFJC as a licensee, inasmuch as
a fifty percent (50%) budget cut
by the Foothill District Governing
Board appeared imminent at the
time; and (3) the attitudes of
KZSU station officials regarding
their general policy toward KFJC.
Needless to say, a decision was
reached to file the objection. And
it is clear, in retrospect, that the
attitudes of KZSU's management
was the deciding factor.
At this date, it is not our
contention that KZSU will never
