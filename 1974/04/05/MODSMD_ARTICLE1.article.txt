# Senate Discusses Academic Freedom
## 
### DON COX 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
began debate on a new Statement on
Academic Freedom that stresses the
internal resolution of faculty
members' grievances rather than
recourse to the courts.
"It is our conviction that the
University should be the foremost
guardian of the freedoms that sustain
it," concluded a faculty committee
chaired by Math Prof. Paul Berg which
refined the statement and delineated
procedures for its enforcement.
The statement recognized the need
for the expression of diversified
viewpoints by faculty members, "free
from institutional orthodoxy and from
internal or external coercion."
Members' constitutional rights were
also guaranteed.
Debate centered around provisions
that qualified the assertion that key
admintrative and academic decisions
would be made "without regard to a
person's political, social or other
views" and to "the conduct of a
person holding an appointment at
Stanford."
These views and conduct would be
irrelevant, "unless [they] are directly
related to academic values or to the
assumption of academic
responsibilities," the statement said.
'Incomprehensible'
The language of the section
including these provisions and also
ones regarding discipline and
affirmative action policies in faculty
search procedures, "is

incomprehensible," said Assoc.
Medical Microbiology Prof. Leon
Rosen be rg.
Rosenberg advocated the adoption
of an amended statementsubmitted by
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Bernard
Roth which said decisions should be
made without regard to views or
conduct "related to expression of First
Amendment values."
This amended version was qualified
only by the recognition that decisions
"based on judgements of professional
competence or the performance of
specific and clearly defined academic
duties" should not be prevented.
In offering the amended statement,
Rosenberg said "the assertion of
[faculty] rights takes primacy" and
that the committee's document
incorrectly centered on faculty
discipline and related faculty rights to
disciplinary procedures.
President Lyman and other senate
members questioned the deletion in
the amended statement of the
provision immunizing the University's

application of affirmative action
policies in its faculty search
procedures.
Shouldn't Affect Hiring
Rosenberg asserted that "no
conduct" a person has committed
prior to reaching Stanford as a faculty
member should affect the hiring
decision.
Disagreement also arose over a
clause that certain provisions "do not
create contractural rights subject to
review by agencies outside the
University."
Roth construed this to mean that
faculty members with grievances
would be prevented from going to
court with their case.
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a
member of the committee presenting
the statement, assured Roth that the
clause "won't prevent anyone from
going to court and it won't get the
case thrown out immediately."
'Can't Be Saved'
Assoc. Education Prof. David
Tyack, another committee member,
said that the University should not
rely on the courts to resolve faculty
grievances..
"If the University can't protect its
own integrity, then sooner or later we
won't be saved by the courts," he said.
Following a vote to resolve into the
Committee of the Whole, the senate
continued discussion on the Report on
the Professoriate.
