# Lyman's Challenge To Government
## 
### 
Tim Ferguson

Quoting the words of World War I French
Marshal Foch, Stanford President Richard
Lyman recently offered this description of
the plight of private higher education, and an
escape therefrom: "My center is giving way,
my right is pushed back — excellent! 11l
attack!"
His audience was the annual conference of
the National Association of Independent
Schools. Although, after paraphrasing
Edmund Burke, Lyman lamented that the
cause of the Association lacked any
champion with the eloquence of Burke, the
President's speech on behalf of the integrity
and purpose of private education was sterling
and most heartening.
Encouraging was the fact that here, at
long last, was an academician of Lyman's
standing challenging the monolithy of
government education, and doing so with
such a fine definition of the purpose of
independent schooling.
Manifest Defense
Lyman's defense of the private sector is
manifest: it strengthens the individual's
"capacity to stand up against the otherwise
overwhelming force of modern government."
Destruction of its institutions, foundations
and churches through regulation of
oppressive taxation " leaves the individual,
defenseless and alone, confronted by the
power of an all-encompassing state."

But the private sector is in trouble, Lyman
finds. "We are swimming against very
powerful tides..., he notes. "They are
running against the private sector in
American life generally. The watchwords are
equality and cost-effectiveness."
The pursuit of egalitarianism is at the
forefront of these destructive attitudinal
inroads. Lyman points to the British Labour
Party's moves against English private schools
under the "notion that one student's progress
necessarily implies another's failure."
Equality of opportunity is not enough,
Lyman says. What must be guaranteed, in the
egalitarian view, is equality of result.
'Reverse Discrimination'
"Reverse discrimination" against
independent schools, such as Stanford, that
hav;* ihaintained unusually high standards of
achievement is a possible outcome of
over-reaction to the pitfalls of privilege,
according to Lyman.
The independent schools must counter
such prejudices, Lyman says, by stressing the
right of every person to realize his or her full
potential. "Excellence and individuality ...
| must be] the guiding principles of our
institutional lives."
The diverse yet occasionally-overlapping
labyrinth of the private institutions sets
cost-conscious bureaucratic mouths watering,
Lyman says. The disorder "whets the

ever-present appetite for controlling, in the
guise of coordinating." How true—yet
cost-ignorant academia often brings coercion
upon itself with a reliacne upon federal
funds. In such a way is Lyman's Stanford in
chains up to its ears.
Surrender 'Pluralism'?
But the President is not about to
surrender the "pluralism" of American
society to an omnipresent government. He
recommends that private institutions impress
upon their students the uniqueness and
importance to British and American culture
of what Burke called the "little platoons":
the intermediate corporate bodies and
parochial loyalties that [stand] between the
individual and the state."
A concomitant demonstration of high
standards by the private sector will help
secure its place in the future, Lyman believes.
But he is not at all optimistic: the tides are
such as to drown the unfit swimmer.
Lyman fears that H.L. Mencken spoke
fatefully in saying, "The last sound to issue
from a human gullet will be three cheers
from the last optimist."
The day of that final gasp will be delayed,
if not pre-empted, one might suspect, by
subsequent forays in the defense of
independence such as that of the eloquent
Lyman.

Quoting the words of World War I French
Marshal Foch, Stanford President Richard
Lyman recently offered this description of
the plight of private higher education, and an
escape therefrom: "My center is giving way,
my right is pushed back — excellent! 11l
attack!"
His audience was the annual conference of
the National Association of Independent
Schools. Although, after paraphrasing
Edmund Burke, Lyman lamented that the
cause of the Association lacked any
champion with the eloquence of Burke, the
President's speech on behalf of the integrity
and purpose of private education was sterling
and most heartening.
Encouraging was the fact that here, at
long last, was an academician of Lyman's
standing challenging the monolithy of
government education, and doing so with
such a fine definition of the purpose of
independent schooling.
Manifest Defense
Lyman's defense of the private sector is
manifest: it strengthens the individual's
"capacity to stand up against the otherwise
overwhelming force of modern government."
Destruction of its institutions, foundations
and churches through regulation of
oppressive taxation " leaves the individual,
defenseless and alone, confronted by the
power of an all-encompassing state."

But the private sector is in trouble, Lyman
finds. "We are swimming against very
powerful tides..., he notes. "They are
running against the private sector in
American life generally. The watchwords are
equality and cost-effectiveness."
The pursuit of egalitarianism is at the
forefront of these destructive attitudinal
inroads. Lyman points to the British Labour
Party's moves against English private schools
under the "notion that one student's progress
necessarily implies another's failure."
Equality of opportunity is not enough,
Lyman says. What must be guaranteed, in the
egalitarian view, is equality of result.
'Reverse Discrimination'
"Reverse discrimination" against
independent schools, such as Stanford, that
hav;* ihaintained unusually high standards of
achievement is a possible outcome of
over-reaction to the pitfalls of privilege,
according to Lyman.
The independent schools must counter
such prejudices, Lyman says, by stressing the
right of every person to realize his or her full
potential. "Excellence and individuality ...
| must be] the guiding principles of our
institutional lives."
The diverse yet occasionally-overlapping
labyrinth of the private institutions sets
cost-conscious bureaucratic mouths watering,
Lyman says. The disorder "whets the

ever-present appetite for controlling, in the
guise of coordinating." How true—yet
cost-ignorant academia often brings coercion
upon itself with a reliacne upon federal
funds. In such a way is Lyman's Stanford in
chains up to its ears.
Surrender 'Pluralism'?
But the President is not about to
surrender the "pluralism" of American
society to an omnipresent government. He
recommends that private institutions impress
upon their students the uniqueness and
importance to British and American culture
of what Burke called the "little platoons":
the intermediate corporate bodies and
parochial loyalties that [stand] between the
individual and the state."
A concomitant demonstration of high
standards by the private sector will help
secure its place in the future, Lyman believes.
But he is not at all optimistic: the tides are
such as to drown the unfit swimmer.
Lyman fears that H.L. Mencken spoke
fatefully in saying, "The last sound to issue
from a human gullet will be three cheers
from the last optimist."
The day of that final gasp will be delayed,
if not pre-empted, one might suspect, by
subsequent forays in the defense of
independence such as that of the eloquent
Lyman.
