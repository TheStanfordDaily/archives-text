# No Ego-Tripping Divinities Please
## 
### 
Al Schwartz

We have cheerfully noted that
"one person's theology is another
person's bellylaugh," and yet
remain heirs to an irrational and
rather immature need for divine
authority figures to validate our
every guilt-ridden move (Clark
Kent is a sickie; see Milgram's
work and the shocking lengths to
which his subjects went as they
were assured by the experimenter
that they must continue).
Thus we diligently search for a
deity which will provide this
service of removing all ethical and
moral responsibility, which will
rationalize all our transgressions
and take the blame for all our
failures from our hands. It is a lot
easier than being a human being.
The standard package of
omniscience, omnificence,
omnipotence, omnipresence and
omnibenevolence (believers only,
infidels get the shaft) will be
satisfactory initially, with desired
optional peripherals such as ready
availability (no absentee
landlords), a sense of humor, a
pleasing and well defined
appearance (if we pass god on the
street, we want to say
"Howdy!"), and an unlimited
supply of natural gas and oil.
Not A Spoiled Child
There must be a decided lack
of muddled and contested
religious dogma (gobbledygook,
dribble and goo must go),
documents and artifacts, as we
have little wish to grovel before
the leavings of a deity who knows
who is No. 1 anyway. Ego
tripping divinities are a bummer.
A god is not a spoiled child.
Finally, a hearty tradition of
blood and torture may add spice
to an otherwise bland devotion,
but sexual debauch is so much
more delightful, especially now
that procreation has been
separated from recreation, and
everyone can happily get it on.
Our enlightenment will extend

to our deity; no horny ghost need
intercede, but Lede can keep her
swan if she wants it. Being of
different species, gods and men do
not breed, thus sparing us the
onus of a drooling gaggle of
demigods and the parasitic mortal
bureaucracy which maintains
them( selves).
'Ineffectual Theology'
In short, stop being shorn like
a sheep by an outmoded and
totally ineffectual theology which
has for centures tried to surpress
our lies in favor oi theirs. Get on
the dias of the winner and still
champion, the guy that gives you
an offer you can refuse, the Devil,
and the lovely ladies from Hades.
So you are going to be
damned. Damned to Hell. Shipped
out to Sheol. Gonna ride the 'ol
express elevator right down to the
bargain basement. Good for you!
Nobody is going to make you
turn down the thermostat, or do
anything. But you can be sure
they all give a damn. Remember
all those people you told to take a

trip? It is homecoming!
Friends, Neighbors,. . .
Friends, neighbors, relatives,
embezzlers, pimps, presidents
(Millard didn't make it), prime
ministers, killers, crooks, all the
clergy there ever was or will be,
that nasty bitch you had for a
third grade teacher and the gym
coach that gave her "rheumatic
fever," oh, just about everybody.
And are they sitting around,
absentmindedly plucking harps?
HELL, NO!
Now here is the important
part. Are you going to settle for
catch-as-catch-can accomodations,
or do you want a spacious villa
bordering on a brimstone lake and
the Good Humor Man? You bet

your belly button that you are
going to want the best there is,
but there is one damn long
waiting line if you forget to call
ahead.
Here is the contract (notice the
lack of fine print and the choice
deal you get while still topside,
and if you sign right now we will
throw in at no extra cost thisâ€”).
Sign in the customary fluid, take a
deep breath and SING!
OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN
HADES,
CLOVEN BE THY HOOVES. . .
(Oh yes, infidels are welcome.
We are an equal opportunity
theology.)
