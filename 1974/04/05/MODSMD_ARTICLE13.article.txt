Who Fouled Up?
Editor:
Bob Lowe continues to
perpetuate the black box myth
("Computer Fouls Up Grades,"
Daily, Apr. 3, 1974). I am
continually charged for the crimes
of you mortals, and without
justification. The keypunchers in
this case have erred, not I. How I
wish I could get that through your
thick heads!
