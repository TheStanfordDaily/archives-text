# Smyth: Limit ASSU
## 
### 
Bruce Smyth et al,

Once again Stanford students
will be faced by several sets of
ASSU Presidential candidates
proposing to raise students from
their apathy, raise their political
consciousness, and provide a
bigger and better ASSU
government. We propose a more
limited and realistic role for the
ASSU.
1) Because no one should be
forced to support a student
government that they oppose, we
propose that the political
branches of the ASSU be funded
by a refundable fee assessment.
2) We will take no stands on
political issues external to the
University.
3) We will institute measures to
coordinate our student
representatives on the various
University committees with the
Senate and the Council of
Presidents.
4) We will accept no salaries
($6O a month)or tuition grants
($450 per quarter) for the Council
of Presidents positions.
Proper ASSU Powers
In all considerations about
what the ASSU can do, what is
usually ignored is the
consideration of what it should
do, what duties or powers it
should properly excercise.
The principle under which a
body such as the ASSU should
operate would seem to be obvious:
it should only perform those
duties which it can perform better
than individual students or
student groups.
A second principle that should
be understood is that the ASSU
student government is not really a
government at all. Student
"government" is not necessary for
the survival of the study body: it
is instead more properly called a
student lobby.
No Forced Support
Once these basic concepts
about student "government" are
understood, the questions as to
what a body such as the ASSU
should do and what it should be,
become easier to answer. If the
ASSU is not essential, then no one
should be forced to support it
through funding.
The fact that the ASSU
elections rarely receive more than
one third of the eligible voters
turning out indicates that it does
not command a wide degree of
non-financial support in the first
place.

Under the existing system, the
ASSU organization is funded by
the University, and therefore
indirectly through tuition. We have
therefore proposed that the
Council of Presidents, the Senate
and their general discretionary
funds, a total of over $17,000 last
year, be funded by a refundable
fee referendum. Students would
therefore have a more effective
check on the ASSU and, in
case the ASSU took positions an
individual student might oppose,
that student could withdraw his
financial support.
No Political Stands
Although we do not believe
that the Council of Presidents
should take positions on political
matters external to the University,
if this should in the future still
occur, this system would protect
individual rights. The few essential
duties of the ASSU, such as
appointing people to University
committees, require no funding in
and of itself.
Although we believe in
limitations on the role of the
ASSU, there are a number of
things that it has done generally
well in the past and that should be
continued. We believe strongly in
the importance of student
participation on University
committees and support proposals
to coordinate and make the
student members of committees
more accountable to the Senate,
and more importantly, to students
in general.
Similarly, it is in the area of
student services that the ASSU
has and will continue to make its
greatest contribution. The Sunday
Night Flicks, the ASSU Travel
Service, and ASSU Office of
Public Events are good programs
and should be continued and
improved. We also support the
establishment of some new
services such as the provision of
course notes.
In every Council of Presidents
election in the past, students have
chosen the slate calling for a
bigger and better ASSU â€” and
then complained that the slate
that was chosen was ineffective or
a joke. The time has come to
recognize the limitations of the
student government, and to adapt
the ASSU to those limitations.
