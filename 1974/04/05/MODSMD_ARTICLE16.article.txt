# Bacon: New Goals
## 
### 
800 Bacon eta/.

In an examination of the ideal
ASSU, the concept of the ASSU
as an organization that directs
itself towards serving the needs of
students clearly emerges.
The ASSU should provide the
resources necessary to affect the
changes and meet the goals,
desired by the student body. This
is best accomplished bychannelling
and organizing student energies
towards these ends. Sometimes,
this will take the form of placing
qualified students on University
committees to insure student
input into the decisions that
affect them.
Or, when the need exists, it can
take the form of helping students
create programs that are relevant
to their interests. Such programs
as SWOPSI, CROW, and SCIRE
are instances of the ASSU
assisting in translating student
ideas into concrete realities.
The ASSU has its limitations —
but it can be effective in moving
on the areas of student concern.
Council Must Serve
The Council of Presidents main
responsibility is to serve, and not
to become involved or start
crusades that divert its energies
away from its duties. For
example, the Stanford student
body has shown an interest in
education that relates to this
country's social realities.
Over 1000 students
participated in SWOPSI this year,
demonstrating a clear demand for
courses not offered by regular
departments.
We feel that the COP can be
instrumental in organizing viable
student input to urge departments
to incorporate many of the
established SWOPSI course into
their program offerings. This
would free SWOPSI to
concentrate on meeting new
student needs and innovations.
New Student Services
The ASSU should also provide

student services that are lacking
elsewhere. We propose to establish
a Guide For Off-Campus Living to
provide information to assist the
several thousand students who live
off-campus in the problems they
face.
Information to be included
would be in such areas as leases,
tenants' rights, and how to
establish a food conspiracy — just
to name a few.
For students who are
interested in applying their
knowledge to socially worthwhile
goals, we will work to see that
Public Interest Research Group
(PIRG) reaches its full potential at
Stanford. PIRG is a research
opportunity which will allow
students to research important
public issues with the support of a
professional staff.
Consumers And Environment
The results of this research will
lay the foundation of litigation
and lobbying in such areas as
consumer protection, and a clean
environment.
An organization that attempts
to handle such a variety of tasks,
clearly needs experienced and
innovative personnel. Our slate is
composed of individuals who have
served in a variety of leadership
positions in organizations
(SWOPSI, PIRG, MECHA, the
REAL NEWS) that attempt to
make positive contributions to the
Stanford Community.
Between us, we possess a wide
range of interests, and a depth of
background. We are unified by
our desire to meet the needs of
the student body, by being
sensitive to its members desires. It
will take dedication, coupled with
administrative experience in order
to have an effective ASSU.

Echaveste and Jack Handy are
candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)

range of interests, and a depth of
background. We are unified by
our desire to meet the needs of
the student body, by being
sensitive to its members desires. It
will take dedication, coupled with
administrative experience in order
to have an effective ASSU.

In an examination of the ideal
ASSU, the concept of the ASSU
as an organization that directs
itself towards serving the needs of
students clearly emerges.
The ASSU should provide the
resources necessary to affect the
changes and meet the goals,
desired by the student body. This
is best accomplished bychannelling
and organizing student energies
towards these ends. Sometimes,
this will take the form of placing
qualified students on University
committees to insure student
input into the decisions that
affect them.
Or, when the need exists, it can
take the form of helping students
create programs that are relevant
to their interests. Such programs
as SWOPSI, CROW, and SCIRE
are instances of the ASSU
assisting in translating student
ideas into concrete realities.
The ASSU has its limitations —
but it can be effective in moving
on the areas of student concern.
Council Must Serve
The Council of Presidents main
responsibility is to serve, and not
to become involved or start
crusades that divert its energies
away from its duties. For
example, the Stanford student
body has shown an interest in
education that relates to this
country's social realities.
Over 1000 students
participated in SWOPSI this year,
demonstrating a clear demand for
courses not offered by regular
departments.
We feel that the COP can be
instrumental in organizing viable
student input to urge departments
to incorporate many of the
established SWOPSI course into
their program offerings. This
would free SWOPSI to
concentrate on meeting new
student needs and innovations.
New Student Services
The ASSU should also provide

student services that are lacking
elsewhere. We propose to establish
a Guide For Off-Campus Living to
provide information to assist the
several thousand students who live
off-campus in the problems they
face.
Information to be included
would be in such areas as leases,
tenants' rights, and how to
establish a food conspiracy — just
to name a few.
For students who are
interested in applying their
knowledge to socially worthwhile
goals, we will work to see that
Public Interest Research Group
(PIRG) reaches its full potential at
Stanford. PIRG is a research
opportunity which will allow
students to research important
public issues with the support of a
professional staff.
Consumers And Environment
The results of this research will
lay the foundation of litigation
and lobbying in such areas as
consumer protection, and a clean
environment.
An organization that attempts
to handle such a variety of tasks,
clearly needs experienced and
innovative personnel. Our slate is
composed of individuals who have
served in a variety of leadership
positions in organizations
(SWOPSI, PIRG, MECHA, the
REAL NEWS) that attempt to
make positive contributions to the
Stanford Community.
Between us, we possess a wide
range of interests, and a depth of
background. We are unified by
our desire to meet the needs of
the student body, by being
sensitive to its members desires. It
will take dedication, coupled with
administrative experience in order
to have an effective ASSU.
