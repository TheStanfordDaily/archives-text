# Ramek-Axtell
## 
### 
Leo Ramek, John Axtell

As a result of an unfortunate
and highly embarrassing mishap,
our names have inadvertently
been placed on the ASSU ballot.
Nonetheless, after a careful
examination of the situation, we
find our qualifications
unmatched.
To condense our political
philosophies into printable
material for a fishwrapper
publication is not an easy task.
However, we herein present a
compendium of our more
pertinent thoughts for your
delectation and for our
opponents' edification.
Not being beset by the mental
constipation characteristic of our
opponents, we offer these ideas as
mere afterthoughts. But first, we
must address ourselves to the
slanderous barrages that have been
waged against us.
It is not true that we are
unresponsive to the plight of
women. We feel that Women's Lip
speaks for itself. As a corollary,
neither do we side with the
right-to-lifers or the Catatonic
Church in the stand against
aberration. We feel that any
woman should be able to have an
aberration upon demand after
consultation with a licentious
physician.
We refuse to concern ourselves
with any of the inane issues that
preoccupy our desperate

opponents. You may ask, then,
what do we represent? None of
your bloody business.
Actually, we do have
qualifications, and they don't
merely state how many times
we've been on a PIRG, or a CJP,
or an EM 80. Our platform
doesn't simply concern itself with
women's rights, minorities, more
concerts, or streakers or other
people with improper toilet
training.
We are concerned with
questions asking why the Stanford
community is not a democracy;
why its funds are controlled by a
self-perpetuating Board of
Trustees rather than by a political
body elected by the community
(including the students).
We wonder why there are so
many tenured lecturers that the
students can't stand. We wonder
about a lot of the piddlycrap the
other slates are concerned with,
but we realize that you didn't
even vote in the last election.
So if you're tired of the
quasi-psychotic behavior of past
presidents, if you're disgusted
with the human debris that has in
the past made a mockery of
student government, do your bit
for democracy and elect
Ramek-Axtell.
(Leo Ramek and John Axtcll are
candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)

Leo Ramek, John Axtell

As a result of an unfortunate
and highly embarrassing mishap,
our names have inadvertently
been placed on the ASSU ballot.
Nonetheless, after a careful
examination of the situation, we
find our qualifications
unmatched.
To condense our political
philosophies into printable
material for a fishwrapper
publication is not an easy task.
However, we herein present a
compendium of our more
pertinent thoughts for your
delectation and for our
opponents' edification.
Not being beset by the mental
constipation characteristic of our
opponents, we offer these ideas as
mere afterthoughts. But first, we
must address ourselves to the
slanderous barrages that have been
waged against us.
It is not true that we are
unresponsive to the plight of
women. We feel that Women's Lip
speaks for itself. As a corollary,
neither do we side with the
right-to-lifers or the Catatonic
Church in the stand against
aberration. We feel that any
woman should be able to have an
aberration upon demand after
consultation with a licentious
physician.
We refuse to concern ourselves
with any of the inane issues that
preoccupy our desperate

opponents. You may ask, then,
what do we represent? None of
your bloody business.
Actually, we do have
qualifications, and they don't
merely state how many times
we've been on a PIRG, or a CJP,
or an EM 80. Our platform
doesn't simply concern itself with
women's rights, minorities, more
concerts, or streakers or other
people with improper toilet
training.
We are concerned with
questions asking why the Stanford
community is not a democracy;
why its funds are controlled by a
self-perpetuating Board of
Trustees rather than by a political
body elected by the community
(including the students).
We wonder why there are so
many tenured lecturers that the
students can't stand. We wonder
about a lot of the piddlycrap the
other slates are concerned with,
but we realize that you didn't
even vote in the last election.
So if you're tired of the
quasi-psychotic behavior of past
presidents, if you're disgusted
with the human debris that has in
the past made a mockery of
student government, do your bit
for democracy and elect
Ramek-Axtell.
