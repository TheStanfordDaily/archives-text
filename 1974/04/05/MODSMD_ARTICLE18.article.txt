Mr. Ray Olszewski complains
(Daily, April 3) that the
economics faculty is being unduly
slow in implementing its
resolutions of Feb. 8 regarding
staff and curriculum in Marxian
and other "alternative
approaches" to economics. May I
reply briefly?
Since Feb. 8, we have taken
the following steps:
(1) A search committee,
headed by John Gurley, was
established to make
recommendations for a regular
faculty appointment in this field.
The committee has agreed on the
general terms of reference for the
new position. It has approved and
mailed letters of inquiry to a large
list of references asking for
nominations and appraisals of
candidates, and it now awaits
their replies.
(2) On the recommendation of
the search committee, Or. Josef
Steindl of Vienna has been invited
by the Department to serve as
Visiting Professor for 1974-75,
and he has indicated his
acceptance. Subject to
administrative approval both in
Vienna and in Stanford, Dr.
Steindl will be here for the entire
academic year.
leading Austrian Economist
Dr. Steindl, a leading Austrian
economist, is a senior member of

the Institute for Economic
Research in Vienna. He was a
collaborator and close student of
the famous Polish economist,
Michael Kalecki. He is the author
of many books: among his books
in English are Maturity and
Stagnation in the American
Economy, Random Processes and
the Growth of Firms and Small
and Big Business. Dr. Steindl
proposes to offer the following
courses (in addition to
participating in Economics 395):
—Marx and His Influence in
Economics
— Income Distribution:
Classical, Neo-classical and
Marxist Theories
—Kalecki's Analysis of the
Capitalist Economy
(3) A committee to consider
revision of the Department's
undergraduate curriculum was
established. This committee met
during the past quarter and
discussed its own program of
work. It has put itself in touch
with possible student members
and proposes to work actively
together with student members
during the present quarter.
I believe these actions
represent effective steps to
implement the faculty's
resolutions.
