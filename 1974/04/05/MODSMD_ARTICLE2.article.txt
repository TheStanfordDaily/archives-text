# Boys Town Funds Youth Study Center
## 
### 
Boys Town, the famed Lincoln,
Neb. organization, announced
yesterday that it will fund a Center for
the Study of Youth Development here
to the tune of $450,000 a year for the
next 25 years.
President Richard Lyman and
Archbishop Daniel E. Sheehan,
president of the Boys Town board of
directors, made the announcement in
San Francisco.
Boys Town will also give up to $1.5
million for physical facilities to house
the center, which will be located in
renovated space on the Main Quad.
The program will become the
University's largest privately funded
research project, according to a
University statement. The purpose of
the project is to conduct "basic
research on the effects of deprivation
and neglect on the life chances of
children and the opportunities open to
them in adulthood, and to teach and
to train qualified persons to teach or
practice" in these areas, according to
the statement.
Emeritus Psychology Prof. Robert
Sears will serve as acting director of
the center. Between eight and 12
Stanford faculty members will serve
up to half-time at the center while
remaining in their regular academic
departments.
The center's director will report to
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
but will also work closely with the
dean of the School of Education. Sears
himself is a former Humanities and
Sciences dean.
Boys Town is funding a similar
center at Catholic University of

America in Washington, D.C. The
Catholic center was announced in
January.
Boys Town has named Ronald A.
Feldman, acting dean of social work at
Washington University in St. Louis, to
coordinate research at the facilities.
Boys Town is frequently associated
in the public mind with images of
Spencer Tracy in the movie of the
same name. In fact, however, the
organization has an endowment that
makes it one of the wealthiest
educational institutions in the
country, as a Pulitzer Prize-winning
series of articles in the Sun newspapers
of Omaha disclosed two years ago.
