# 'Challenge '74'
## 
### 
Chris Murray et al.

"Challenge '74" is a
representative slate. We are not
bound by any special interest
group. We pledge to represent
both the general and specific
interests of all students.
We view the challenge in '74 as
the opportunity to further reform
the ASSU. This reform requires
taking existing ideas and putting
them into effect.
Our reform efforts would begin
with the continuation and
reorganization of the valuable
innovations initiated by both the
Scott Burke and Kevin O'Grady
administrations.
Our primary objective will be
to facilitate the innovations of
previous administrations.
"Challenge '74" pledges to
increase the flow of information
between the student body and
their government.
With this type of
representation, the former power
of a few, will truly incorporate
the power of a whole association.
This will serve to effectively
achieve the goals and will of that
complete association.
More Student Housing
Each year the housing draw
leaves many students without a
place to live. One of the objectives
of "Challenge '74" is to assure
that by the end of 1974 there will
be a definite commitment to
construct additional student
housing.
This can be accomplished by
the encouragement of
widespread student concern. Jim
Friend has initiated a drive to
publicize the student housing
problem. We believe it is
imperative that further action be
continued throughout the term of
the next Council of Presidents.
We support the fee assessment
for the Speakers Bureau.
Moreover, we wish to enhance the
Guest-in-Residence program by
lengthening the visits of guest
lecturers.
Involve Freshmen
"Challenge '74" will initiate a
program designed to involve

freshmen in student government.
This will be a multi dimensional
project which will create an Office
of Freshman Services (OFS). We
will seek to encourage active
participation by involving
freshmen in the workings of the
ASSU.
This office will serve as a
counseling and guidance service
for the many problems facing new
students. It will also focus on
campus orientation, advertising
services and programs of the
ASSU, and introducing a periodic
rap session with the Council of
Presidents.
"Challenge '74" will attempt
to negotiate an end to the five
year judicial dispute between the
ASSU and the administration.
However, we continue to hold: 1)
a non-revokable student majority
is desirable on the SJC in cases
involving students; 2) that the SJC
be approved by the students, as is
required in Article IV, Section 2,
of the ASSU Constitution; and 3)
that the students have a voice in
determining membership on the
panel.
Legal Office Facilities
We will establish permanent
office facilities for the Legal
Counseling Office (LCO) in order
to insure the continuation of the
free legal services offered to all
students.
We are confident that our
platform will benefit the entire
Student Body. As a slate, two of
us have been working with
student government. The other
two of us are interested students
who seek to relate the ASSU to
services of a non-political nature.
This balance will enable us to
create a student oriented ASSU.
We urge every student to help
us begin our program of increased
ASSU participation by voting on
April 10 and 11 for the challenge
confronting you in 1974.
(Chris Murray, Chip Underwood,
Marion Chung and Paul Vogen are
candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)
