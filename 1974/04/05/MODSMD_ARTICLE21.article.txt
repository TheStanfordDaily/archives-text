# Herman: Don't Waste Time
## 
### 
Mite Herman et al.

ASSU elections can be unpleasant for the
students because they find themselves confronted by
a host of promises, gimmicks, and rhetoric. Past
disillusionment and disappointment, coupled with
general disinterest in the functions of the ASSU,
make these campaigns frustrating and distasteful
for nearly everyone concerned.
Given these circumstances, it would be an insult
to the student body to run anything less than a
serious campaign, addressing ourselves to the real
issues and offering realistic proposals to benefit the
Stanford community.
Our ticket presents a blend of experience in the
ASSU, particularly in the University Committee
structure with the freshness of views held outside
student government. The latter allows us to
approach issues with a new perspective, while the
former gives us a feel for how students are most
able to be effective within the University structure.
We believe that the ASSU can be most effective
in pressing for change and improvements within the
University. Involvement in issues which do not
directly concern Stanford students is a waste of
precious time and effort. While such activities boost
the ego of ASSU officers, they divert them from
taking action in the arena wherein they can have
the greatest effect.
Precise Proposals
We have composed a lengthy booklet detailing
our platform, setting out precisely what we intend
to try to do if elected. Among our proposals are:
The Record Bazaar — Because we are interested
in student services at Stanford, we would like to
establish a cooperative student discount store on
campus. This is our ultimate goal. However, as a
realistic first step, we envision the Stanford Record
Bazaar starting on a small scale with record sales,
much in the manner in which "Leopold's" of
Berkeley began.
Lecture Notes — We propose to establish an
organization of students who would take notes in
major lecture courses throughout the school, print
them, and distribute them to subscribing members
of the selected classes. Providing dittoed outlines
has been a goal often articulated during elections,
but action has yet to be taken on it. The use of
paid student notetakers and a well-structured

organization headed by a board of directors will
bring that concept to fulfillment.
'The Bulletin' Proposed
The Bulletin — Because information about
events on campus is often incomplete or
unavailable, we propose to establish a weekly
bulletin listing the time and place of departmental
speakers, club speakers, movies, special activities,
dorm speakers, and athletic events. This bulletin
would be a single source of information that could
easily be consulted and would cover all events at
Stanford.
The Residential College — We will push for the
establishment of a residential college at Stanford,
first recommended in the Study of Education at
Stanford. The concept of bringing an Ivy
League-type theme college to Stanford requires
negotiating with the Dean of Students and the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, an area in which
being acquainted with the administration would be
most helpful. We believe the establishemnt of such
an innovative program would be highly beneficial
to the students.
The Intellectual Union — In order to combine
the advantages of formal presentations and smaller,
more relaxed exchanges between students and
figures of the intellectual community, we propose
to form an Intellectual Union that would
consolidate many of the independent, less effective
attempts to attract guests the student body would
like to meet and hear. The Union itself would
closely resemble a club in structure, with regular
membership and elected officers.
These are explicit, practical proposals that will
offer concrete benefits to Stanford students. The
structure of the ASSU exists to serve its
constitutents, the students, and its primary purpose
is to improve the conditions of student life.
Through our basic s/uctenf-affairs-oriented
approach to issues and the experience we bring into
meeting those issues, we feel best-qualified to serve
as your next Council of Presidents. We hope to earn
your vote on April 10 and 11.
(Mike Herman, Ann Carter, Len Mackey and Quinn
Mayer are candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)

of the selected classes. Providing dittoed outlines
has been a goal often articulated during elections,

organization headed by a board of directors will
bring that concept to fulfillment.
'The Bulletin' Proposed
The Bulletin — Because information about
events on campus is often incomplete or
unavailable, we propose to establish a weekly
bulletin listing the time and place of departmental
speakers, club speakers, movies, special activities,
dorm speakers, and athletic events. This bulletin
would be a single source of information that could
easily be consulted and would cover all events at
Stanford.
The Residential College — We will push for the
establishment of a residential college at Stanford,
first recommended in the Study of Education at
Stanford. The concept of bringing an Ivy
League-type theme college to Stanford requires
negotiating with the Dean of Students and the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, an area in which
being acquainted with the administration would be
most helpful. We believe the establishemnt of such
an innovative program would be highly beneficial
to the students.
The Intellectual Union — In order to combine
the advantages of formal presentations and smaller,
more relaxed exchanges between students and
figures of the intellectual community, we propose
to form an Intellectual Union that would
consolidate many of the independent, less effective
attempts to attract guests the student body would
like to meet and hear. The Union itself would
closely resemble a club in structure, with regular
membership and elected officers.
These are explicit, practical proposals that will
offer concrete benefits to Stanford students. The
structure of the ASSU exists to serve its
constitutents, the students, and its primary purpose
is to improve the conditions of student life.
Through our basic s/uctenf-affairs-oriented
approach to issues and the experience we bring into
meeting those issues, we feel best-qualified to serve
as your next Council of Presidents. We hope to earn
your vote on April 10 and 11.
(Mike Herman, Ann Carter, Len Mackey and Quinn
Mayer are candidates for ASSU Council of
Presidents.)

ASSU elections can be unpleasant for the
students because they find themselves confronted by
a host of promises, gimmicks, and rhetoric. Past
disillusionment and disappointment, coupled with
general disinterest in the functions of the ASSU,
make these campaigns frustrating and distasteful
for nearly everyone concerned.
Given these circumstances, it would be an insult
to the student body to run anything less than a
serious campaign, addressing ourselves to the real
issues and offering realistic proposals to benefit the
Stanford community.
Our ticket presents a blend of experience in the
ASSU, particularly in the University Committee
structure with the freshness of views held outside
student government. The latter allows us to
approach issues with a new perspective, while the
former gives us a feel for how students are most
able to be effective within the University structure.
We believe that the ASSU can be most effective
in pressing for change and improvements within the
University. Involvement in issues which do not
directly concern Stanford students is a waste of
precious time and effort. While such activities boost
the ego of ASSU officers, they divert them from
taking action in the arena wherein they can have
the greatest effect.
Precise Proposals
We have composed a lengthy booklet detailing
our platform, setting out precisely what we intend
to try to do if elected. Among our proposals are:
The Record Bazaar — Because we are interested
in student services at Stanford, we would like to
establish a cooperative student discount store on
campus. This is our ultimate goal. However, as a
realistic first step, we envision the Stanford Record
Bazaar starting on a small scale with record sales,
much in the manner in which "Leopold's" of
Berkeley began.
Lecture Notes — We propose to establish an
organization of students who would take notes in
major lecture courses throughout the school, print
them, and distribute them to subscribing members
of the selected classes. Providing dittoed outlines
has been a goal often articulated during elections,
but action has yet to be taken on it. The use of
paid student notetakers and a well-structured

organization headed by a board of directors will
