# Aleveras: Ordinary People
## 
### 
Jim Aleveras et 01.

This year there are six tickets
running for ASSU Council of
Presidents. We are one of those
tickets. By one criterion we have
no qualifications at all for the
offices we are seeking. Most of the
other candidates are ASSU
senators, or have been active in
student government or outside
politics. None of us has ever run
for anything here before.
Year after year, more or less
the same sort of people are
elected to the Presidency. They're
professionals who know and use
all the vote-getting gimmicks.
We are just four ordinary
individuals who are fed up with
the razzle-dazzle professional
politicos whose promises have
rarely been delivered. And this is
our chief qualification. Since we
are not members of a political
clique, we can better represent the
interests of the vast majority of
Stanford students.
Our platform is simple. First,
we want to expand the tangible
services the ASSU offers students.
On Special Events
In the past, ASSU Special
Events has presented a few large
performances. In addition to big
events by well known artists, we
want to expand the program to
include smaller scale presentations

appealing to diverse interests.
The Speakers Program that was
highly touted during the last
campaign has not realized its
potential. It could be coordinated
with the various academic
departments to provide a wide
range of personal appearances by
authorities from every field from
political to academic.
Among the many unfulfilled
promises of the past is a plan to
provide (for a small charge) copies
of lecture notes for large classes.
Although there are administrative
and financial obstacles, this idea
has worked in a number of
universities. It enables students to
get more out of lectures, and also
blunts the effects of a day's
absence.
The Pub
For two years "Little Leland's
Pub" or variations thereof have
been major campaign promises.
Maybe an on-campus pub is
impossible — but maybe those
who promised it were too busy
with special interests. We'd like to

find out.
Although wo are mainly
concerned with expanding services
to students, we do not deny the
role of the ASSU (particularly the
Senate) as a forum for political
and social issues. We aren't
activists, but we feel that the
Council of Presidents should be a
resource center for anyone with
ideas for social or political change.
Since we are not committed to
any political faction, perhaps all
groups can get a fairer hearing.
We think the con game of
student politics has gone on long
enough. We do not have to
promise reform because we were
never corrupt in the first place.
Our platform is not
earthshaking, but it is honest and
attainable. If you're ready for an
alternative to the sham of
Stanford student politics, we're
on your side.

Jason Chang and Ed Anderson are

concerned with expanding services
to students, we do not deny the
role of the ASSU (particularly the
Senate) as a forum for political
and social issues. We aren't
activists, but we feel that the
Council of Presidents should be a
resource center for anyone with
ideas for social or political change.
Since we are not committed to
any political faction, perhaps all
groups can get a fairer hearing.
We think the con game of
student politics has gone on long
enough. We do not have to
promise reform because we were
never corrupt in the first place.
Our platform is not
earthshaking, but it is honest and
attainable. If you're ready for an
alternative to the sham of
Stanford student politics, we're
on your side.

Jason Chang and Ed Anderson are
candidates for ASSU Council of

This year there are six tickets
running for ASSU Council of
Presidents. We are one of those
tickets. By one criterion we have
no qualifications at all for the
offices we are seeking. Most of the
other candidates are ASSU
senators, or have been active in
student government or outside
politics. None of us has ever run
for anything here before.
Year after year, more or less
the same sort of people are
elected to the Presidency. They're
professionals who know and use
all the vote-getting gimmicks.
We are just four ordinary
individuals who are fed up with
the razzle-dazzle professional
politicos whose promises have
rarely been delivered. And this is
our chief qualification. Since we
are not members of a political
clique, we can better represent the
interests of the vast majority of
Stanford students.
Our platform is simple. First,
we want to expand the tangible
services the ASSU offers students.
On Special Events
In the past, ASSU Special
Events has presented a few large
performances. In addition to big
events by well known artists, we
want to expand the program to
include smaller scale presentations

appealing to diverse interests.
The Speakers Program that was
highly touted during the last
campaign has not realized its
potential. It could be coordinated
with the various academic
departments to provide a wide
range of personal appearances by
authorities from every field from
political to academic.
Among the many unfulfilled
promises of the past is a plan to
provide (for a small charge) copies
of lecture notes for large classes.
Although there are administrative
and financial obstacles, this idea
has worked in a number of
universities. It enables students to
get more out of lectures, and also
blunts the effects of a day's
absence.
The Pub
For two years "Little Leland's
Pub" or variations thereof have
been major campaign promises.
Maybe an on-campus pub is
impossible — but maybe those
who promised it were too busy
with special interests. We'd like to

find out.
