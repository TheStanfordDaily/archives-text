# German Dept. Offers Individuality
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
"The vast majority of the students in our
beginning language classes have no interest in
German literature ... some just want to clear the
hurdle of a requirement, some are taking German
because they have a grandfather who was born in
the Black Forest, (and) some want to learn German
in order to do field work in anthropology."
In making these remarks to a December meeting
of the Association of Departments of Foreign
Languages held in Chicago, German Studies
department chairman Walter F.W. Lohnes
elaborated upon many of the changes and
innovations which have swept the department in
the last decade. The American Council of
Education report of 1970 named it fourth in the
nation.
The primary change has been a change in focus
— away from the traditional emphasis upon "that
crowning achievement and ultimate aim of all
foreign language study: the Ph.D. in a national
literature.
"If we start with 600 students per year, and if
only one or two of those end up with a Ph.D. in
German eight or ten years later, are we then not
obliged to provide for the remaining 99 percent as
well and .. . with as much zeal and dedication as
we do our Ph.D.s?" Lohnes asked.
One innovation has been the "P" series of
individually programmed first year German.
Designed for students who have heavy course loads
or scheduling conflicts, the program allows the
student to pace himself.
Self-Paced Program
It does not involve the use of computers, but
simply the standard text and study guide
co-authored by Lohnes and F.W. Strothmann. The
student learns each unit at his own pace and takes
unit tests when he feels he is ready. The tests must
be passed with a score of at least 80 percent in
order to move on, but they may be retaken as
many times as the student wishes.
The course may be taken pass/fail or for a grade.
The number of units depends upon the number of
unit exams completed such that if all unit and final
exams are taken the same 15 units are granted as
for the standard first year course.
According to Gertrude Mahrholz, the professor
in charge of the program, "We require that the
student pass with at least an 80 percent because we
feel that if he is doing it on his own, without class
reinforcement, he needs to have it cold.
Group Meetings
"There is a false premise in that language always
requires two people" she said. For this reason, the
students meet as a group for conversation at
arranged times twice a week.

Many students who have a proficiency in
languages use it to speed up the course and may
complete a year's work in two quarters. There are
approximately 40 students enrolled this quarter.
To reflect the department's broadening of scope,
its name was changed three years ago from
"German'' to "German Studies."
Overseas Program
One of the first signs leading to this change had
been the creation of the Overseas Program and the
opening of the first German campus in 1958.
The program was started by Strothmann,
chairman of the Department of Modern European
Languages, the largest department in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
It created an opportunity for students to study
in Europe not only "as foreign language majors, but
as general students who would become engineers or
mathematicians as well as historians or Germanists"
Lohnes said.
In 1961, the department constructed an
additional special program for advanced
undergraduates and first year graduate students at
the University of Hamburg. It is now located at the
University of Bonn and is open to students in
History and other majors besides German Studies.
Major Programs
For its undergraduate majors, the department
offers four tracks: language, literature, thought,
and a new core in German Studies. The first three
require 45 departmental units beyond the second
year level. The latter program is now in its third
year and requires only 25 units within the
department and 25 units in courses dealing with
Central Europe.
Lohnes noted that approximately 50 percent of
the department's majors have chosen the new
program, which was initiated at the same time as a
translation and interpretation program.
The department is currently studying the
possibility of a fifth teaching track which would
combine a B.A. in German Studies with a California
State Teaching Credential.
Next year two new full professors will be added
to the faculty—Katharina Mommsen, one of the
world's leading Goethe experts, and Gerald
Gillespie, who will teach German and comparative
literature courses.
Both have expressed an interest in teaching
undergraduates, and Gillespie will offer a Literature
1 course for incoming freshmen which is
comparable to History 1.
In addition, the department attempts to teach at
least one university-wide course each quarter with
all reading and lectures in English.
"A few of these courses have attracted as many
as 300 students," Lohnes said.

the University of Hamburg. It is now located at the
University of Bonn and is open to students in
History and other majors besides German Studies.
Major Programs
For its undergraduate majors, the department
offers four tracks: language, literature, thought,
and a new core in German Studies. The first three
require 45 departmental units beyond the second
year level. The latter program is now in its third
year and requires only 25 units within the
department and 25 units in courses dealing with
Central Europe.
Lohnes noted that approximately 50 percent of
the department's majors have chosen the new
program, which was initiated at the same time as a
translation and interpretation program.
The department is currently studying the
possibility of a fifth teaching track which would
combine a B.A. in German Studies with a California
State Teaching Credential.
Next year two new full professors will be added
to the faculty—Katharina Mommsen, one of the
world's leading Goethe experts, and Gerald
Gillespie, who will teach German and comparative
literature courses.
Both have expressed an interest in teaching
undergraduates, and Gillespie will offer a Literature
1 course for incoming freshmen which is
comparable to History 1.
In addition, the department attempts to teach at
least one university-wide course each quarter with
all reading and lectures in English.
"A few of these courses have attracted as many
as 300 students," Lohnes said.
"The vast majority of the students in our
beginning language classes have no interest in
German literature ... some just want to clear the
hurdle of a requirement, some are taking German
because they have a grandfather who was born in
the Black Forest, (and) some want to learn German
in order to do field work in anthropology."
In making these remarks to a December meeting
of the Association of Departments of Foreign
Languages held in Chicago, German Studies
department chairman Walter F.W. Lohnes
elaborated upon many of the changes and
innovations which have swept the department in
the last decade. The American Council of
Education report of 1970 named it fourth in the
nation.
The primary change has been a change in focus
— away from the traditional emphasis upon "that
crowning achievement and ultimate aim of all
foreign language study: the Ph.D. in a national
literature.
"If we start with 600 students per year, and if
only one or two of those end up with a Ph.D. in
German eight or ten years later, are we then not
obliged to provide for the remaining 99 percent as
well and .. . with as much zeal and dedication as
we do our Ph.D.s?" Lohnes asked.
One innovation has been the "P" series of
individually programmed first year German.
Designed for students who have heavy course loads
or scheduling conflicts, the program allows the
student to pace himself.
Self-Paced Program
It does not involve the use of computers, but
simply the standard text and study guide
co-authored by Lohnes and F.W. Strothmann. The
student learns each unit at his own pace and takes
unit tests when he feels he is ready. The tests must
be passed with a score of at least 80 percent in
order to move on, but they may be retaken as
many times as the student wishes.
The course may be taken pass/fail or for a grade.
The number of units depends upon the number of
unit exams completed such that if all unit and final
exams are taken the same 15 units are granted as
for the standard first year course.
According to Gertrude Mahrholz, the professor
in charge of the program, "We require that the
student pass with at least an 80 percent because we
feel that if he is doing it on his own, without class
reinforcement, he needs to have it cold.
Group Meetings
"There is a false premise in that language always
requires two people" she said. For this reason, the
students meet as a group for conversation at
arranged times twice a week.

Many students who have a proficiency in
languages use it to speed up the course and may
complete a year's work in two quarters. There are
approximately 40 students enrolled this quarter.
To reflect the department's broadening of scope,
its name was changed three years ago from
"German'' to "German Studies."
Overseas Program
One of the first signs leading to this change had
been the creation of the Overseas Program and the
opening of the first German campus in 1958.
The program was started by Strothmann,
chairman of the Department of Modern European
Languages, the largest department in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
It created an opportunity for students to study
in Europe not only "as foreign language majors, but
as general students who would become engineers or
mathematicians as well as historians or Germanists"
Lohnes said.

According to Gertrude Mahrholz, the professor
in charge of the program, "We require that the
student pass with at least an 80 percent because we
feel that if he is doing it on his own, without class
reinforcement, he needs to have it cold.
Group Meetings
"There is a false premise in that language always
requires two people" she said. For this reason, the
students meet as a group for conversation at
arranged times twice a week.

Many students who have a proficiency in
languages use it to speed up the course and may
complete a year's work in two quarters. There are
approximately 40 students enrolled this quarter.
To reflect the department's broadening of scope,
its name was changed three years ago from
"German'' to "German Studies."
Overseas Program
One of the first signs leading to this change had
been the creation of the Overseas Program and the
opening of the first German campus in 1958.
The program was started by Strothmann,
chairman of the Department of Modern European
Languages, the largest department in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
It created an opportunity for students to study
in Europe not only "as foreign language majors, but
as general students who would become engineers or
mathematicians as well as historians or Germanists"
Lohnes said.
In 1961, the department constructed an
additional special program for advanced
undergraduates and first year graduate students at
the University of Hamburg. It is now located at the
University of Bonn and is open to students in
History and other majors besides German Studies.
Major Programs
For its undergraduate majors, the department
offers four tracks: language, literature, thought,
and a new core in German Studies. The first three
require 45 departmental units beyond the second
year level. The latter program is now in its third
year and requires only 25 units within the
department and 25 units in courses dealing with
Central Europe.
Lohnes noted that approximately 50 percent of
the department's majors have chosen the new
program, which was initiated at the same time as a
translation and interpretation program.
The department is currently studying the
possibility of a fifth teaching track which would
combine a B.A. in German Studies with a California
State Teaching Credential.
Next year two new full professors will be added
to the faculty—Katharina Mommsen, one of the
world's leading Goethe experts, and Gerald
Gillespie, who will teach German and comparative
literature courses.
Both have expressed an interest in teaching
undergraduates, and Gillespie will offer a Literature
1 course for incoming freshmen which is
comparable to History 1.
In addition, the department attempts to teach at
least one university-wide course each quarter with
all reading and lectures in English.
"A few of these courses have attracted as many
as 300 students," Lohnes said.
