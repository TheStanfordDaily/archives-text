# Jesse Colin Young Performs Monday
## 
### 

On Monday, April 8, ASSU Special Events will present Jesse
Colin Young in Memorial Auditorium.
Young is best known as former guitarist-bassist-vocalist of the
now-defunct Youngbloods, which received national recognition in
1968 with "Get Together."
The Youngbloods disbanded in 1972, and Young soon formed
a second band, with himself as headliner, and released the
successful album Together.
With a smooth, mellow voice, Young handles a wide range of
styles, including rock, folk, blues, country, and jazz.
Also appearing on the bill, on short notice, is the
Bloomfield-Naftalin band, who played at Maples Pavilion just last
December.
This blues-rock band, made up of an offshoot of the famous
Paul Butterfield Blues Band, included Mike Bloomfield (guitar),
Mark Naftalin (keyboards), Roger "Jelly Roll" Troy (bass), and
George Rains (drums).
This will be Bloomfield's last appearance with this lineup, in
all likelihood, before he reorganizes The Electric Flag.
Naftalin will be returning to Stanford on April 18 for a solo
piano recital at Tresidder's Large Lounge.
Tickets for Jesse Colin Young are $3.50, on sale at Tresidder
Box Office. Starting times are 7:30 and 10.
