# England's YES Satisfies At Winterland
## 
### KEITH COPELAND Beware—The Ides of March 
The antithesis of this statement
would have been true for the
hundreds-thousands by late
afternoon-of fans who waited
patiently, some for as long as 24
hours, to see England's YES.
Those who came early in the
day were treated to a brief
glimpse of the group members as
their limosines arrived at the stage
entrance. On Friday, vocalist Jon
Anderson endeared fans by
coming out and visiting briefly.
Fans were amused on Saturday
as Steve Howe, guitar case in
hand, arrived in an old Fairlane.
He had apparently hitchhiked!
Both nights saw Winterland
filled to capacity a full hour
before the show.
The audience was restless after
Charlie Starr, the warmup act,
finished. To be perfectly honest,
the audience was getting restless
throughout his act.
Through the system was heard
"Firebird Suite." The audience
knew it was showtime.
Multi-colored lights began to flash
in a large tunnel on the left side of
the stage. YES emerged from the
tunnel and took their places and
began "Siberian Khatru."
It was obvious that YES excel's
every prominent rock group
today. Their technically perfect,
rapidly driving, passion
exhilirating melodies, produce
reverance in all who come to
understand them.
Slowing the pace, YES began
"And You And I" from the album
Close to the Edge. Jon Anderson's

voice proved to be especially
pleasant in his tale of the search.
Steve Howe showed amazing
adaptability as he played two
guitars throughout the piece. The
second guitar was one of three,
including a steel guitar, attached
to a rotating stand, allowing Howe
to play both almost
simultaneously.
YES showcased the concert
with "Tales From Topographic
Oceans," their latest work.
Anderson and Howe conceived of
the idea while on tour in Tokyo.
Based on Shastric scriptures,
four-movement "Oceans"
attempts to trace man's path from
God through evolution to his
return to the Sun.
YES began the first movement,
"Shrutis, The Revealing Science
of God," relating the search for
God — how the quest for oneness
with our creator is a piecemeal
process of constant endurance.
The music conveyed this message
in such a way as to make one feel
its truth. Of special interest was
Anderson's playing of the acoustic
guitar.
Unfortunately, YES deleted
the second movement, "Suritis,
The Remembering." Whatever
their reasons, this reporter was
disappointed that "Suritis," the
movement most featuring Rick
Wakeman was not a part of the
show.
Next YES performed the third
movement, "Puranas, The
Ancient," which attempts to
reflect the vast stores of
knowledge of lost civilizations.
Steve Howe's acoustic guitar was

instrumental in reflecting the
treasures lost to us from the
civilizations of India, China,
Central America, and Atlantis.
Chris Squire added an extra touch
on acoustic bass.
The last movement, "Tantras,
The Ritual," attempted to show
how the ritual of life is a fight

between the sources of evil and
pure love. Bassist Squire and
percussionist Alan White were
featured as they presented the
struggle which brings a positive
source: our return to the sun. The
movement's subtitle, "Nous
Sommes Du Soleil" means 'we are
of the sun.'

The climax of the concert
occured near the end as Howe,
Anderson, Squire, and White
played drums simultaneously.
The audience had to have
more, and after a prolonged
ovation YES returned for encores
including "Roundabout" and
"Starship Trooper."

Charlie Starr, the warmup act,
finished. To be perfectly honest,
the audience was getting restless
throughout his act.
Through the system was heard
"Firebird Suite." The audience
knew it was showtime.
Multi-colored lights began to flash
in a large tunnel on the left side of
the stage. YES emerged from the
tunnel and took their places and
began "Siberian Khatru."
It was obvious that YES excel's
every prominent rock group
today. Their technically perfect,
rapidly driving, passion
exhilirating melodies, produce
reverance in all who come to
understand them.
Slowing the pace, YES began
"And You And I" from the album
Close to the Edge. Jon Anderson's

voice proved to be especially
pleasant in his tale of the search.
Steve Howe showed amazing
adaptability as he played two
guitars throughout the piece. The
second guitar was one of three,
including a steel guitar, attached
to a rotating stand, allowing Howe
to play both almost
simultaneously.
YES showcased the concert
with "Tales From Topographic
Oceans," their latest work.
Anderson and Howe conceived of
the idea while on tour in Tokyo.
Based on Shastric scriptures,
four-movement "Oceans"
attempts to trace man's path from
God through evolution to his
return to the Sun.
YES began the first movement,
"Shrutis, The Revealing Science
of God," relating the search for
God — how the quest for oneness
with our creator is a piecemeal
process of constant endurance.
The music conveyed this message
in such a way as to make one feel
its truth. Of special interest was
Anderson's playing of the acoustic
guitar.
Unfortunately, YES deleted
the second movement, "Suritis,
The Remembering." Whatever
their reasons, this reporter was
disappointed that "Suritis," the
movement most featuring Rick
Wakeman was not a part of the
show.
Next YES performed the third
movement, "Puranas, The
Ancient," which attempts to
reflect the vast stores of
knowledge of lost civilizations.
Steve Howe's acoustic guitar was

instrumental in reflecting the
treasures lost to us from the
civilizations of India, China,
Central America, and Atlantis.
Chris Squire added an extra touch
on acoustic bass.
The last movement, "Tantras,
The Ritual," attempted to show
how the ritual of life is a fight

between the sources of evil and
pure love. Bassist Squire and
percussionist Alan White were
featured as they presented the
struggle which brings a positive
source: our return to the sun. The
movement's subtitle, "Nous
Sommes Du Soleil" means 'we are
of the sun.'

The climax of the concert
occured near the end as Howe,
Anderson, Squire, and White
played drums simultaneously.
The audience had to have
more, and after a prolonged
ovation YES returned for encores
including "Roundabout" and
"Starship Trooper."

YES SUlTE—England's rock quintet YES performed "Tales From Topographic Oceans," a
four-movement suite at Winterland recently. Unfortunately, the group chose to nrpsentonly three of the
four movements, among some of its more familiar hits.
The antithesis of this statement
would have been true for the
hundreds-thousands by late
afternoon-of fans who waited
patiently, some for as long as 24
hours, to see England's YES.
Those who came early in the
day were treated to a brief
glimpse of the group members as
their limosines arrived at the stage
entrance. On Friday, vocalist Jon
Anderson endeared fans by
coming out and visiting briefly.
Fans were amused on Saturday
as Steve Howe, guitar case in
hand, arrived in an old Fairlane.
He had apparently hitchhiked!
Both nights saw Winterland
filled to capacity a full hour
before the show.
The audience was restless after
Charlie Starr, the warmup act,
