# 'Great Gatsby' Boasts Fine Screenplay, Acting
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI DAN FORTE 
It is always difficult to create a
successful film from a successful
novel and maintain any degree of
consistency between the two. In
the case of a novel like The Great
Gatsby, one would expect the
achievement of the novel to
overshadow any cinematic
attempts at a recreation of
Fitzgerald's art. Produced by
David Merrick and directed by
Jack Clayton, the film version of
The Great Gatsby is at worst
successful and at best incisively
pure.
Although a fairly long film
(almost 2Vi hours), extensive
editing and rearranging of the
novel is evident in Francis Ford
Coppola's screenplay. Much to his
credit, Coppola manages to
sustain Fitzgerald's prose tone of
the 1920s in a framework that is
largely constructed from the
dialogue of the novel.
The film literally begins, for
example, on page one of the novel
with the narrative voice of Nick
Carraway (Sam Waterston): "In
my younger and more vulnerable
years my father gave me some
advice that I've been turning over
in my mind ever since...
Like the novel, Merrick's film
is laced with counterpoint. The
film unfolds as almost a continual
sigh counterpointed by the lilting
voice of Daisy Buchanon (Mia
Farrow) which is described by
Fitzgerald as being "the kind of
voice that the ear follows up and

down, as if each speech is an
arrangement of notes that will
never be played again."
Similarly, the two most
lingering attitudes in the film
(boredom and restlessness) focus
on the heat and the wealth of a
fashionable Long Island summer
among the elite East Egg
community.
The apathy and uneasiness of
the rich are counterpointed
visually and thematically by the
valley of ashes and the eyes of Dr.
T.J. Eckleburg, which are,
according to Fitzgerald, "blue and
gigantic — their retinas are one
yard high. They look out of no
face, but instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which
pass over a non-existent nose."
In a much larger context, the
eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are
representative of caring — a kind
of empty moral surveilance absent
from wealthy East Egg. At one
point in the film George Wilson
(Scott Wilson), while looking at
the billboard advertisement that
houses Eckleburg's eyes, tells his
wife that "you can't fool God."
As in T.S. Eliot's "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
many of Fitzgerald's images and
metaphors in The Great Gatsby
are undercut by a pervading sense
of decay aid negligence. In the
several lavish party scenes, for
example, there is a steady current
of destruction and carelessness
manifested in food wasted, vases
broken, and liquor spilled on
expensive rugs.

Like the parties of Gatsby
(Robert Redford), events merge in
the film from a passive
background, shine momentarily,
and fade into memory. In one
scene, a dining room filled with
late-luncheon patrons is disrupted
by Daisy as she runs out of the
room and toward the door. Faces
turn to watch her, the sounds of
clinking glasses and silverware
cease, the conversation halts. But
only for a moment. The
interruption is all but negated as
soon as Daisy is beyond vision and
the event becomes a memory.
The heat and wealth of
summer on East Egg combine in
the film to produce a kind of
social paralysis. Life in general is
seen as almost too much of an
effort. As Daisy puts it at one
point, "What shall we do with
ourselves this afternoon, and the
day after that, and the next thirty
years?"
Throughout the film, the
voices of Jordan Baker (Lois
Chiles) and Daisy, as much as
what they say, exemplify the
social class to which they belong
— the artificial, thoughtless, and
secure position of the upper class
in 1920. As Gatsby says of Daisy,
"her voice is full of money."
As in a good cartoon or tall
tale, the film version of The Great
Gatsby is presented with one foot
in realism and the other in dream.
True to the novel's thematic
intent, Merrick's film sustains the
tragic blend of realism and fantasy
which is the cornerstone of

Gatsby's character — in
Fitzgerald's words, "a satisfactory
hint of the unreality of reality, a
promise that the rock of the
world was founded securely on a
fairy's wing."
To underscore this sort of
unreality, Merrick makes use of
slightly blurred closeups and
warm, rich colors giving the film a
dreamy, romantic quality.
Some scenes were shot with
the focus on objects instead of the
people — cars, gas pumps, flowers.
The individual performances in
the film are outstanding, almost
to a man. For the most part, they
adhere closely to the mental
pictures one gets from the novel.
The role of Tom Buchanon
represents a huge ascension for
actor Bruce Dern, having starred
in numerous low-budget horror
and motorcycle films.
Fitzgerald thought Tom to be
the strongest character in the
novel. From his intial appearance,
Dern fits the description
perfectly.
"Two shining arrogant eyes
had established dominance over
his face and gave him the
appearance of always leaning
aggressively forward. Not even the
effeminate swank of his riding
clothes could hide the enormous
power of that body — he seemed
to fill those glistening boots until
he strained the top lacing, and
you could see a great pack of
muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was
a body capable of enormous
leverage—a cruel body."
Dern manages to maintain this
tension throughout the entire
film.
One cannot talk about the
acting without making special
mention of the uncanny casting,
by Marion Dougherty Associates.

One such example is Mia Farrow
as Daisy Buchanon.
Farrow's main advantage in
this part is the way she looks —
wide-eyed and fragile — making
the little rich girl come across
quite clearly. Farrow's sing-songy
voice is also very convincing.
The title role brings Robert
Redford his most serious part in
recent appearances. Redford has a
knack for getting a lot said
without words, by using a small,
but effective, set of gestures and
expressions which he has by now
nearly perfected.
This immediately comes to
light in his first appearance, a half
hour into the film, when he meets
Nick, rather uncomfortably. His
facial expressions are even
stronger in later scenes with
Daisy, especially in their first
encounter when he appears from
behind her as a reflection in a
mirror.
Karen Black, of Five Easy
Pieces, marks the only significant
change in character, as Myrtle
Wilson, Tom's mistress. Black
sophisticates the part to a degree,
smoothing over the roughness of
the garage owner's wife.
"There was an immediately
perceptible vitality about her as if
the nerves of her body were
continually smouldering." This
vitality is toned down a bit in the
film.
Scott Wilson, as Myrtle's
husband, seems well suited for the
pitiful character, who is always
seen sweating, shivering, and
greasy — constantly being
humbled by Buchanon and his
money.
Daisy's cousin Nick, the story's
narrator, is played by Sam
Waterston. Waterston brings the
character off as being very likable
and somewhat innocent,
especially in the scenes where he

too is a bit humbled by all the
wealth and status, as in his first
encounter with Gatsby.
Lois Chiles, of The Way We
Were, is cast as Jordan Baker,
probably on the basis of her voice
which couldn't sound more
lethargic, apathetic, and, most of
all, rich.
Overall, there was not a single
instance of overacting, a claim too
few films can boast.
The Great Gctsby has become
possibly the most publicized film
since The Godfather, more than

paying its $6,000,000 budget in
advance sales alone. Because of this
many viewers will no doubt be
expecting the world and be
disappointed. But, how much a
film is publicized should not hold
any weight as far as the film's own
merits.
The Great Gatsby is more than
just an ambitious attempt; it is a
very successful interpretation of a
great work. As co-star Bruce Dem
said in a recent interview, "It's a
good film, but not a great
film—not a classic."

power of that body — he seemed
to fill those glistening boots until
he strained the top lacing, and
you could see a great pack of
muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was
a body capable of enormous
leverage—a cruel body."
Dern manages to maintain this
tension throughout the entire
film.
One cannot talk about the
acting without making special
mention of the uncanny casting,
by Marion Dougherty Associates.

One such example is Mia Farrow
as Daisy Buchanon.
Farrow's main advantage in
this part is the way she looks —
wide-eyed and fragile — making
the little rich girl come across
quite clearly. Farrow's sing-songy
voice is also very convincing.
The title role brings Robert
Redford his most serious part in
recent appearances. Redford has a
knack for getting a lot said
without words, by using a small,
but effective, set of gestures and
expressions which he has by now
nearly perfected.
This immediately comes to
light in his first appearance, a half
hour into the film, when he meets
Nick, rather uncomfortably. His
facial expressions are even
stronger in later scenes with
Daisy, especially in their first
encounter when he appears from
behind her as a reflection in a
mirror.
Karen Black, of Five Easy
Pieces, marks the only significant
change in character, as Myrtle
Wilson, Tom's mistress. Black
sophisticates the part to a degree,
smoothing over the roughness of
the garage owner's wife.
"There was an immediately
perceptible vitality about her as if
the nerves of her body were
continually smouldering." This
vitality is toned down a bit in the
film.
Scott Wilson, as Myrtle's
husband, seems well suited for the
pitiful character, who is always
seen sweating, shivering, and
greasy — constantly being
humbled by Buchanon and his
money.
Daisy's cousin Nick, the story's
narrator, is played by Sam
Waterston. Waterston brings the
character off as being very likable
and somewhat innocent,
especially in the scenes where he

too is a bit humbled by all the
wealth and status, as in his first
encounter with Gatsby.
Lois Chiles, of The Way We
Were, is cast as Jordan Baker,
probably on the basis of her voice
which couldn't sound more
lethargic, apathetic, and, most of
all, rich.
Overall, there was not a single
instance of overacting, a claim too
few films can boast.
The Great Gctsby has become
possibly the most publicized film
since The Godfather, more than

paying its $6,000,000 budget in
advance sales alone. Because of this
many viewers will no doubt be
expecting the world and be
disappointed. But, how much a
film is publicized should not hold
any weight as far as the film's own
merits.
The Great Gatsby is more than
just an ambitious attempt; it is a
very successful interpretation of a
great work. As co-star Bruce Dem
said in a recent interview, "It's a
good film, but not a great
film—not a classic."

GATSBY RECREATED — Robert Redford and Mia Farrow co-stars as Jay
Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan in the film version of F. Scott
Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. The film, produced by David Merrick
and directed by Jack Clayton, costars Bruce Dern as Tom.
It is always difficult to create a
successful film from a successful
novel and maintain any degree of
consistency between the two. In
the case of a novel like The Great
Gatsby, one would expect the
achievement of the novel to
overshadow any cinematic
attempts at a recreation of
Fitzgerald's art. Produced by
David Merrick and directed by
Jack Clayton, the film version of
The Great Gatsby is at worst
successful and at best incisively
pure.
Although a fairly long film
(almost 2Vi hours), extensive
editing and rearranging of the
novel is evident in Francis Ford
Coppola's screenplay. Much to his
credit, Coppola manages to
sustain Fitzgerald's prose tone of
the 1920s in a framework that is
largely constructed from the
dialogue of the novel.
The film literally begins, for
example, on page one of the novel
with the narrative voice of Nick
Carraway (Sam Waterston): "In
my younger and more vulnerable
years my father gave me some
advice that I've been turning over
in my mind ever since...
Like the novel, Merrick's film
is laced with counterpoint. The
film unfolds as almost a continual
sigh counterpointed by the lilting
voice of Daisy Buchanon (Mia
Farrow) which is described by
Fitzgerald as being "the kind of
voice that the ear follows up and

down, as if each speech is an
arrangement of notes that will
never be played again."
Similarly, the two most
lingering attitudes in the film
(boredom and restlessness) focus
on the heat and the wealth of a
fashionable Long Island summer
among the elite East Egg
community.
The apathy and uneasiness of
the rich are counterpointed
visually and thematically by the
valley of ashes and the eyes of Dr.
T.J. Eckleburg, which are,
according to Fitzgerald, "blue and
gigantic — their retinas are one
yard high. They look out of no
face, but instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which
pass over a non-existent nose."
In a much larger context, the
eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are
representative of caring — a kind
of empty moral surveilance absent
from wealthy East Egg. At one
point in the film George Wilson
(Scott Wilson), while looking at
the billboard advertisement that
houses Eckleburg's eyes, tells his
wife that "you can't fool God."
As in T.S. Eliot's "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
many of Fitzgerald's images and
metaphors in The Great Gatsby
are undercut by a pervading sense
of decay aid negligence. In the
several lavish party scenes, for
example, there is a steady current
of destruction and carelessness
manifested in food wasted, vases
broken, and liquor spilled on
expensive rugs.

Like the parties of Gatsby
(Robert Redford), events merge in
the film from a passive
background, shine momentarily,
and fade into memory. In one
scene, a dining room filled with
late-luncheon patrons is disrupted
by Daisy as she runs out of the
room and toward the door. Faces
turn to watch her, the sounds of
clinking glasses and silverware
cease, the conversation halts. But
only for a moment. The
interruption is all but negated as
soon as Daisy is beyond vision and
the event becomes a memory.
The heat and wealth of
summer on East Egg combine in
the film to produce a kind of
social paralysis. Life in general is
seen as almost too much of an
effort. As Daisy puts it at one
point, "What shall we do with
ourselves this afternoon, and the
day after that, and the next thirty
years?"
Throughout the film, the
voices of Jordan Baker (Lois
Chiles) and Daisy, as much as
what they say, exemplify the
social class to which they belong
— the artificial, thoughtless, and
secure position of the upper class
in 1920. As Gatsby says of Daisy,
"her voice is full of money."
As in a good cartoon or tall
tale, the film version of The Great
Gatsby is presented with one foot
in realism and the other in dream.
True to the novel's thematic
intent, Merrick's film sustains the
tragic blend of realism and fantasy
which is the cornerstone of

Gatsby's character — in
Fitzgerald's words, "a satisfactory
hint of the unreality of reality, a
promise that the rock of the
world was founded securely on a
fairy's wing."
To underscore this sort of
unreality, Merrick makes use of
slightly blurred closeups and
warm, rich colors giving the film a
dreamy, romantic quality.
Some scenes were shot with
the focus on objects instead of the
people — cars, gas pumps, flowers.
The individual performances in
the film are outstanding, almost
to a man. For the most part, they
adhere closely to the mental
pictures one gets from the novel.
The role of Tom Buchanon
represents a huge ascension for
actor Bruce Dern, having starred
in numerous low-budget horror
and motorcycle films.
Fitzgerald thought Tom to be
the strongest character in the
novel. From his intial appearance,
Dern fits the description
perfectly.
"Two shining arrogant eyes
had established dominance over
his face and gave him the
appearance of always leaning
aggressively forward. Not even the
effeminate swank of his riding
clothes could hide the enormous
power of that body — he seemed
to fill those glistening boots until
he strained the top lacing, and
you could see a great pack of
muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was
a body capable of enormous
leverage—a cruel body."
Dern manages to maintain this
tension throughout the entire
film.
One cannot talk about the
acting without making special
mention of the uncanny casting,
by Marion Dougherty Associates.

as Daisy Buchanon.
Farrow's main advantage in

pass over a non-existent nose."
In a much larger context, the
eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are
representative of caring — a kind
of empty moral surveilance absent
from wealthy East Egg. At one
point in the film George Wilson
(Scott Wilson), while looking at
the billboard advertisement that
houses Eckleburg's eyes, tells his
wife that "you can't fool God."
As in T.S. Eliot's "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
many of Fitzgerald's images and
metaphors in The Great Gatsby
are undercut by a pervading sense
of decay aid negligence. In the
several lavish party scenes, for
example, there is a steady current
of destruction and carelessness
manifested in food wasted, vases
broken, and liquor spilled on
expensive rugs.

Like the parties of Gatsby
(Robert Redford), events merge in
the film from a passive
background, shine momentarily,
and fade into memory. In one
scene, a dining room filled with
late-luncheon patrons is disrupted
by Daisy as she runs out of the
room and toward the door. Faces
turn to watch her, the sounds of
clinking glasses and silverware
cease, the conversation halts. But
only for a moment. The
interruption is all but negated as
soon as Daisy is beyond vision and
the event becomes a memory.
The heat and wealth of
summer on East Egg combine in
the film to produce a kind of
social paralysis. Life in general is
seen as almost too much of an
effort. As Daisy puts it at one
point, "What shall we do with
ourselves this afternoon, and the
day after that, and the next thirty
years?"
Throughout the film, the
voices of Jordan Baker (Lois
Chiles) and Daisy, as much as
what they say, exemplify the
social class to which they belong
— the artificial, thoughtless, and
secure position of the upper class
in 1920. As Gatsby says of Daisy,
"her voice is full of money."
As in a good cartoon or tall
tale, the film version of The Great
Gatsby is presented with one foot
in realism and the other in dream.
True to the novel's thematic
intent, Merrick's film sustains the
tragic blend of realism and fantasy
which is the cornerstone of

Gatsby's character — in
Fitzgerald's words, "a satisfactory
hint of the unreality of reality, a
promise that the rock of the
world was founded securely on a
fairy's wing."
To underscore this sort of
unreality, Merrick makes use of
slightly blurred closeups and
warm, rich colors giving the film a
dreamy, romantic quality.
Some scenes were shot with
the focus on objects instead of the
people — cars, gas pumps, flowers.
The individual performances in
the film are outstanding, almost
to a man. For the most part, they
adhere closely to the mental
pictures one gets from the novel.
The role of Tom Buchanon
represents a huge ascension for
actor Bruce Dern, having starred
in numerous low-budget horror
and motorcycle films.
Fitzgerald thought Tom to be
the strongest character in the
novel. From his intial appearance,
Dern fits the description
perfectly.
"Two shining arrogant eyes
had established dominance over
his face and gave him the
appearance of always leaning
aggressively forward. Not even the
effeminate swank of his riding
clothes could hide the enormous
power of that body — he seemed
to fill those glistening boots until
he strained the top lacing, and
you could see a great pack of
muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was
a body capable of enormous
leverage—a cruel body."
Dern manages to maintain this
tension throughout the entire
film.
One cannot talk about the
acting without making special
mention of the uncanny casting,
by Marion Dougherty Associates.

One such example is Mia Farrow
as Daisy Buchanon.
Farrow's main advantage in
this part is the way she looks —
wide-eyed and fragile — making
the little rich girl come across
quite clearly. Farrow's sing-songy
voice is also very convincing.
The title role brings Robert
Redford his most serious part in
recent appearances. Redford has a
knack for getting a lot said
without words, by using a small,
but effective, set of gestures and
expressions which he has by now
nearly perfected.
This immediately comes to
light in his first appearance, a half
hour into the film, when he meets
Nick, rather uncomfortably. His
facial expressions are even
stronger in later scenes with
Daisy, especially in their first
encounter when he appears from
behind her as a reflection in a
mirror.
Karen Black, of Five Easy
Pieces, marks the only significant
change in character, as Myrtle
Wilson, Tom's mistress. Black
sophisticates the part to a degree,
smoothing over the roughness of
the garage owner's wife.
"There was an immediately
perceptible vitality about her as if
the nerves of her body were
continually smouldering." This
vitality is toned down a bit in the
film.
Scott Wilson, as Myrtle's
husband, seems well suited for the
pitiful character, who is always
seen sweating, shivering, and
greasy — constantly being
humbled by Buchanon and his
money.
Daisy's cousin Nick, the story's
narrator, is played by Sam
Waterston. Waterston brings the
character off as being very likable
and somewhat innocent,
especially in the scenes where he

too is a bit humbled by all the
wealth and status, as in his first
encounter with Gatsby.
Lois Chiles, of The Way We
Were, is cast as Jordan Baker,
probably on the basis of her voice
which couldn't sound more
lethargic, apathetic, and, most of
all, rich.
Overall, there was not a single
instance of overacting, a claim too
few films can boast.
The Great Gctsby has become
possibly the most publicized film
since The Godfather, more than

paying its $6,000,000 budget in
advance sales alone. Because of this
many viewers will no doubt be
expecting the world and be
disappointed. But, how much a
film is publicized should not hold
any weight as far as the film's own
merits.
The Great Gatsby is more than
just an ambitious attempt; it is a
very successful interpretation of a
great work. As co-star Bruce Dem
said in a recent interview, "It's a
good film, but not a great
film—not a classic."

GATSBY RECREATED — Robert Redford and Mia Farrow co-stars as Jay
Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan in the film version of F. Scott
Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. The film, produced by David Merrick
and directed by Jack Clayton, costars Bruce Dern as Tom.
It is always difficult to create a
successful film from a successful
novel and maintain any degree of
consistency between the two. In
the case of a novel like The Great
Gatsby, one would expect the
achievement of the novel to
overshadow any cinematic
attempts at a recreation of
Fitzgerald's art. Produced by
David Merrick and directed by
Jack Clayton, the film version of
The Great Gatsby is at worst
successful and at best incisively
pure.
Although a fairly long film
(almost 2Vi hours), extensive
editing and rearranging of the
novel is evident in Francis Ford
Coppola's screenplay. Much to his
credit, Coppola manages to
sustain Fitzgerald's prose tone of
the 1920s in a framework that is
largely constructed from the
dialogue of the novel.
The film literally begins, for
example, on page one of the novel
with the narrative voice of Nick
Carraway (Sam Waterston): "In
my younger and more vulnerable
years my father gave me some
advice that I've been turning over
in my mind ever since...
Like the novel, Merrick's film
is laced with counterpoint. The
film unfolds as almost a continual
sigh counterpointed by the lilting
voice of Daisy Buchanon (Mia
Farrow) which is described by
Fitzgerald as being "the kind of
voice that the ear follows up and

down, as if each speech is an
arrangement of notes that will
never be played again."
Similarly, the two most
lingering attitudes in the film
(boredom and restlessness) focus
on the heat and the wealth of a
fashionable Long Island summer
among the elite East Egg
community.
The apathy and uneasiness of
the rich are counterpointed
visually and thematically by the
valley of ashes and the eyes of Dr.
T.J. Eckleburg, which are,
according to Fitzgerald, "blue and
gigantic — their retinas are one
yard high. They look out of no
face, but instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which
pass over a non-existent nose."
In a much larger context, the
eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are
representative of caring — a kind
of empty moral surveilance absent
from wealthy East Egg. At one

(Scott Wilson), while looking at

and somewhat innocent,
especially in the scenes where he

too is a bit humbled by all the
wealth and status, as in his first
encounter with Gatsby.
Lois Chiles, of The Way We
Were, is cast as Jordan Baker,
probably on the basis of her voice
which couldn't sound more
lethargic, apathetic, and, most of
all, rich.
Overall, there was not a single
instance of overacting, a claim too
few films can boast.
The Great Gctsby has become
possibly the most publicized film
since The Godfather, more than

paying its $6,000,000 budget in
advance sales alone. Because of this
many viewers will no doubt be
expecting the world and be
disappointed. But, how much a
film is publicized should not hold
any weight as far as the film's own
merits.
The Great Gatsby is more than
just an ambitious attempt; it is a
very successful interpretation of a
great work. As co-star Bruce Dem
said in a recent interview, "It's a
good film, but not a great
film—not a classic."

GATSBY RECREATED — Robert Redford and Mia Farrow co-stars as Jay
Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan in the film version of F. Scott
Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. The film, produced by David Merrick
and directed by Jack Clayton, costars Bruce Dern as Tom.
It is always difficult to create a
successful film from a successful
novel and maintain any degree of
consistency between the two. In
the case of a novel like The Great
Gatsby, one would expect the
achievement of the novel to
overshadow any cinematic
attempts at a recreation of
Fitzgerald's art. Produced by
David Merrick and directed by
Jack Clayton, the film version of
The Great Gatsby is at worst
successful and at best incisively
pure.
Although a fairly long film
(almost 2Vi hours), extensive
editing and rearranging of the
novel is evident in Francis Ford
Coppola's screenplay. Much to his
credit, Coppola manages to
sustain Fitzgerald's prose tone of
the 1920s in a framework that is
largely constructed from the
dialogue of the novel.
The film literally begins, for
example, on page one of the novel
with the narrative voice of Nick
Carraway (Sam Waterston): "In
my younger and more vulnerable
years my father gave me some
advice that I've been turning over
in my mind ever since...
Like the novel, Merrick's film
is laced with counterpoint. The
film unfolds as almost a continual
sigh counterpointed by the lilting
voice of Daisy Buchanon (Mia
Farrow) which is described by
Fitzgerald as being "the kind of
voice that the ear follows up and

down, as if each speech is an
arrangement of notes that will
never be played again."
Similarly, the two most
lingering attitudes in the film
(boredom and restlessness) focus
on the heat and the wealth of a
fashionable Long Island summer
among the elite East Egg
community.
The apathy and uneasiness of
the rich are counterpointed
visually and thematically by the
valley of ashes and the eyes of Dr.
T.J. Eckleburg, which are,
according to Fitzgerald, "blue and
gigantic — their retinas are one
yard high. They look out of no
face, but instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which
pass over a non-existent nose."
In a much larger context, the
eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are
representative of caring — a kind
of empty moral surveilance absent
from wealthy East Egg. At one
point in the film George Wilson
(Scott Wilson), while looking at
the billboard advertisement that
houses Eckleburg's eyes, tells his
wife that "you can't fool God."
As in T.S. Eliot's "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
many of Fitzgerald's images and
metaphors in The Great Gatsby
are undercut by a pervading sense
of decay aid negligence. In the
several lavish party scenes, for
example, there is a steady current
of destruction and carelessness
manifested in food wasted, vases
broken, and liquor spilled on
expensive rugs.

Like the parties of Gatsby
(Robert Redford), events merge in
the film from a passive
background, shine momentarily,
and fade into memory. In one
scene, a dining room filled with
late-luncheon patrons is disrupted
by Daisy as she runs out of the
room and toward the door. Faces
turn to watch her, the sounds of
clinking glasses and silverware
cease, the conversation halts. But
only for a moment. The
interruption is all but negated as
soon as Daisy is beyond vision and
the event becomes a memory.
The heat and wealth of
summer on East Egg combine in
the film to produce a kind of
social paralysis. Life in general is
seen as almost too much of an
effort. As Daisy puts it at one
point, "What shall we do with
ourselves this afternoon, and the
day after that, and the next thirty
years?"
Throughout the film, the
voices of Jordan Baker (Lois
Chiles) and Daisy, as much as
what they say, exemplify the
social class to which they belong
— the artificial, thoughtless, and
secure position of the upper class
in 1920. As Gatsby says of Daisy,
"her voice is full of money."
As in a good cartoon or tall
tale, the film version of The Great
Gatsby is presented with one foot
in realism and the other in dream.
True to the novel's thematic
intent, Merrick's film sustains the
tragic blend of realism and fantasy
which is the cornerstone of

Gatsby's character — in
Fitzgerald's words, "a satisfactory
hint of the unreality of reality, a
promise that the rock of the
world was founded securely on a
fairy's wing."
To underscore this sort of
unreality, Merrick makes use of
slightly blurred closeups and
warm, rich colors giving the film a
dreamy, romantic quality.
Some scenes were shot with
the focus on objects instead of the
people — cars, gas pumps, flowers.
The individual performances in
the film are outstanding, almost
to a man. For the most part, they
adhere closely to the mental
pictures one gets from the novel.
The role of Tom Buchanon
represents a huge ascension for
actor Bruce Dern, having starred
in numerous low-budget horror
and motorcycle films.
Fitzgerald thought Tom to be
the strongest character in the
novel. From his intial appearance,
Dern fits the description
perfectly.
"Two shining arrogant eyes
had established dominance over
his face and gave him the
appearance of always leaning
aggressively forward. Not even the
effeminate swank of his riding
clothes could hide the enormous
power of that body — he seemed
to fill those glistening boots until
he strained the top lacing, and
you could see a great pack of
muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was
a body capable of enormous
leverage—a cruel body."
Dern manages to maintain this
tension throughout the entire
film.
One cannot talk about the
acting without making special
mention of the uncanny casting,
by Marion Dougherty Associates.

One such example is Mia Farrow
as Daisy Buchanon.
Farrow's main advantage in
this part is the way she looks —
wide-eyed and fragile — making
the little rich girl come across
quite clearly. Farrow's sing-songy
voice is also very convincing.
The title role brings Robert
Redford his most serious part in
recent appearances. Redford has a
knack for getting a lot said
without words, by using a small,
but effective, set of gestures and
expressions which he has by now
nearly perfected.
This immediately comes to
light in his first appearance, a half
hour into the film, when he meets
Nick, rather uncomfortably. His
facial expressions are even
stronger in later scenes with
Daisy, especially in their first
encounter when he appears from
behind her as a reflection in a
mirror.
Karen Black, of Five Easy
Pieces, marks the only significant
change in character, as Myrtle
Wilson, Tom's mistress. Black
sophisticates the part to a degree,
smoothing over the roughness of
the garage owner's wife.
"There was an immediately
perceptible vitality about her as if
the nerves of her body were
continually smouldering." This
vitality is toned down a bit in the
film.
Scott Wilson, as Myrtle's
husband, seems well suited for the
pitiful character, who is always
seen sweating, shivering, and
greasy — constantly being
humbled by Buchanon and his
money.
Daisy's cousin Nick, the story's
narrator, is played by Sam
Waterston. Waterston brings the
character off as being very likable
and somewhat innocent,
especially in the scenes where he

too is a bit humbled by all the
wealth and status, as in his first
encounter with Gatsby.
Lois Chiles, of The Way We

probably on the basis of her voice
which couldn't sound more
