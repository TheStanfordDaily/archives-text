# Aqua-Follies To Help Optacon Fund
## 
### 
A spring tradition will return
to Lake Lagunita on Easter
Sunday as the Aqua-Follies are
held to raise funds for the
purchase of several Optacons by
the Stanford Libraries for use by
blind students and researchers.
Student living groups will
compete in log rolling, greased
watermelon races, canoe racing
and jousting, tug of war, and relay
swimming. The $15 to $25 entry
fee per group will go into the
Optacon fund and be one major
source of donations.
In addition, professional
waterskiers will donate a show
featuring ski kiting, barefoot
skiing, clown acts, pyramid skiing
and racing to be held late in the
afternoon.
According to organizer Ed
McKinley, the Aqua-Follies, aside
from providing funds for the
Optacons, will offer students the
"only opportunity to see
fraternities all together." All of
the Lagunita fraternities are
organizing around the follies as a
rush activity.
The Optacon is a device
developed by Prof. John Linvill
which allows blind readers to feel
the shape of letters on a regular
printed page. The device is
particularly useful to the blind as
a method of reading newspapers

and other materials which may
not be printed in Braille.
The devices are marketed by
Telesensory Systems of Palo Alto,
and cost $4000 each. Training a
student to use the Optacon costs
another $500.
After the Aqua-Follies are
held, the organizers plan to raise
matching funds by seeking
donations from sources in the
community.
So that members of the
Stanford community may see the
Optacon in use, a demonstration
will be held in Tresidder Room
270 at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday,
April 9. The half hour
demonstration will be given by
representatives of Telesensory
Systems and a blind Stanford
student.
Living groups wishing to enter
the Aqua-Follies should contact
Keith Schirmer (327-6011) or
Rob Witt (328-9629) by
Wednesday so that events may be
scheduled. Intramural points will
be awarded for the canoe events.
Additional funds will be raised
through the selling of concessions
provided by campus living groups.
Co-ops are especially being urged
to donate home-made food for
the event, and groups wishing to
make food should contact Tom
Snider at 328-6330.

THE OPTACON — Blind student Bob Sweetman demonstrates the Optacon, a device which allows blind
readers to feel the shapes of letters on a regular printed page. The Aqua-Follies will raise funds for the
purchase of several of the devices by the Stanford Libraries. The Optacon was invented by Prof. John
Linvill whose blind daughter Candy is a student here. The device will be demonstrated in a half-hour

presentation to be held Tuesday
night at 9:30 in Tresidder 270.
The presentation will be given by
a blind Stanford student and
