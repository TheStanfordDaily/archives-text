# Still Sees Patty As Kidnap Victim
## FBI To Continue Hearst Probe 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The FBI said
yesterday it still considers Patricia Hearst to be a
kidnap victim and is making an "all-out intensive
effort" to arrest her abductors.
In a tape recorded message received Wednesday,
a voice identified as Miss Hearst's said she had
joined her terrorist captors.
FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley said in
Washington:"The FBI will use all available
resources and take all necessary actions to carry out
responsibility to pursue this case to a successful
conclusion.
"The investigation instituted by the FBI
following the Feb. 4, 1974 abduction of Patricia
Hearst is continuing. The welfare and safety of Miss
Hearst will remain primary concerns of all FBI
personnel as they have been from the outset."
And Charles Bates, FBI agent in charge of the
case, said in San Francisco: "She hasn't been
released. She hasn't come out. As far as we're
concerned, we still have a kidnaping case."

He said the FBI has been making "an all-out
effort and intensive investigation" since Miss Hearst
was taken from her Berkeley apartment. "And our
all-out intensive effort is continuing."
Patricia's mother, Catherine Hearst, expressed
again the family's stunned disbelief at her statement
that she has become a revolutionary and taken the
name of Tania, a fellower of guerrilla leader the
Guevara.
"Only Patty, in person, can convince me that the
terrible, weary words that she uttered came from
her heart and were delivered by her own free will," ,
she said in a written statement issued at her
Hillsborough home.
U.S. Attorney James L. Browning agreed
yesterday that the announcement wouldn't have a
major effect on the investigation. "In my view it
does very little," he said.
Browning explained that a prosecutor would
have to take into consideration a victim's
unwillingness to testify. But he added: "I think if

you want my best guess, there will be prosecutions
in this case, but I don't know of what crime."
Bates said the FBI doesn't believe everything on
a taped message received yesterday from Miss
Hearst's Symbionese Liberation Army abductors.
"There's nothing in the tapes that has changed our
investigation at this point," he said.
On the tape delivered to San Francisco radio
station KSAN, the 20-year-old newspaper heiress
renounced her family and her way of life, called her
father a "corporate liar" and said: "I have chosen to
stay and fight."
Attorney Vincent Hallinan, a trustee for the $4
million escrow fund for free food to be given on
Miss Hearst's safe release, said: "I do have serious
concern that the girl is dead and that Wednesday's
communication may have been a coverup."
Browning said there are no warrants for Miss
Hearst's arrest but if it turns out she cooperated
with her kidnapers from the beginning she could
face prosecution.
