# Oscar-Nominated 'Pedestrian' Explores Guilt In German Society 30 Years After War's End
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
The Pedestrian, a German film
nominated for the Best Foreign
Film Oscar, is a poignant,
beautifully effected study of
death in a humanistic vortex.
Built around the story of a
leading German industrialist
politico's involvement in a My
Lai-type massacre in Greece
during World War 11, it is also a
study of the German conscience,
its torment and development since
Hitler.
A daily newspaper, for political
reasons, questions the guilt of
factory owner Heinz Geise in an
incident with which he was
connected nearly 30 years earlier
while in the German army.
The expose could ruin his
career, and nearly does, but the
upshoot of it all is a kind of
national catharsis concerning
"collective guilt." This is affected
through a televised debate on the
matter, conducted by Geise's
attorney and a representative of
the newspaper, with the accused
and his family sitting in the dock.
It turns out that all Germans
share in the guilt for such
incidents, Geise only slightly more
than all those others who
complied in such war crimes,
having been a bit close to the
scene.
The spokesman for the
newspaper finally admits that
there is no hard evidence
concerning Geise's involvement

beyond his presence at the
massacre, and must also
acknowledge that during the war
his own activities were advancing
Hitler's cause and failing to
expose his criminal acts.
Just before the expose, Geise's
older son who was just taking over
the reins of the family business,
has in effect committed suicide by
grabbing the steering wheel while
his father was driving, causing the
car to smash into the rear of a
truck.
Geise, wanting to protect his
son's name, keeps the details of
the accident and takes the blame,
losing his driver's license and
having to attend safe driving
classes — hence the film's title.
This leads to speculation that the
father may have purposely caused
the accident when his son found
out his complcity in the massacre.
After his public exoneration
over television, Geise still needs
the exoneration of his younger
son, an artsy-hippy type who has
his own apartment in the family
mansion. The younger son replies
that at first he was embarrassed
by the story, but it's none of his
business anyway, and besides, he
knows his father was always too
weak to be involved in such
horrors.
What he hates, the son says, is
the whole business of being a
"bloody German." That he most
wants to escape. In other words,
by adopting another mode of life

than his father's, he wants to
distance himself from the older
generation's sins.
This is the heart of the story:
the older generations sins and the
price they must pay to achieve
atonement. Heinz Geise concludes
that the only adequate price is to
die naturally — in other words,
hope that death will take you in
due course, after you've borne the
horror of your sins in your
conscience as long as fate requires.
Geise's religion is summarized
in a bedtime story he tells his
small grandson:
"A little boy set out to find his
fortune. He met a factory worker
and asked if he knew where he

could find his fortune.
" 'No,' was the reply. Then he
met Death, and asked the same
question.
" 'Yes,' Death said. 'Come
along with me and I will show you
your fortune.'
"Now go to sleep!"
The point is dearly drawn. In a
world without a personal god who
cares enough to provide
atonement for our personal sins,
there is no hope but death — in
other words, no hope.
Narrowly, it applies to
Germans who complied with
Hitler's policies during World War
11. Broadly, as the film makes
clear, it extends to Americans
who complied with Vietnam — all

those too sinful to cast the first
stone at America, and even the
younger generation who long for
freedom from the curse of being
bloody Germans.
In short, it applies to the whole
"bloody" race.
The Pedestrian is, as the
description would indicate, quite
philosophical, quoting several
existentialist philosophers
theologians and poets in its
course. As is the wont of
existentialism, it finds sufficiency
in examining the dilemma of
mankind with sensitivity and
sadness, but little more.
After all, as the Bible says, if it
all ends in the grave anyway, what
more is there?

politico's involvement in a My
Lai-type massacre in Greece
during World War 11, it is also a
study of the German conscience,
its torment and development since
Hitler.
A daily newspaper, for political
reasons, questions the guilt of
factory owner Heinz Geise in an
incident with which he was
connected nearly 30 years earlier
while in the German army.
The expose could ruin his
career, and nearly does, but the
upshoot of it all is a kind of
national catharsis concerning
"collective guilt." This is affected
through a televised debate on the
matter, conducted by Geise's
attorney and a representative of
the newspaper, with the accused
and his family sitting in the dock.
It turns out that all Germans
share in the guilt for such
incidents, Geise only slightly more
than all those others who
complied in such war crimes,
having been a bit close to the
scene.
The spokesman for the
newspaper finally admits that
there is no hard evidence
concerning Geise's involvement

beyond his presence at the
massacre, and must also
acknowledge that during the war
his own activities were advancing
Hitler's cause and failing to
expose his criminal acts.
Just before the expose, Geise's
older son who was just taking over
the reins of the family business,
has in effect committed suicide by
grabbing the steering wheel while
his father was driving, causing the
car to smash into the rear of a
truck.
Geise, wanting to protect his
son's name, keeps the details of
the accident and takes the blame,
losing his driver's license and
having to attend safe driving
classes — hence the film's title.
This leads to speculation that the
father may have purposely caused
the accident when his son found
out his complcity in the massacre.
After his public exoneration
over television, Geise still needs
the exoneration of his younger
son, an artsy-hippy type who has
his own apartment in the family
mansion. The younger son replies
that at first he was embarrassed
by the story, but it's none of his
business anyway, and besides, he
knows his father was always too
weak to be involved in such
horrors.
What he hates, the son says, is
the whole business of being a
"bloody German." That he most
wants to escape. In other words,
by adopting another mode of life

than his father's, he wants to
distance himself from the older
generation's sins.
This is the heart of the story:
the older generations sins and the
price they must pay to achieve
atonement. Heinz Geise concludes
that the only adequate price is to
die naturally — in other words,
hope that death will take you in
due course, after you've borne the
horror of your sins in your
conscience as long as fate requires.
Geise's religion is summarized
in a bedtime story he tells his
small grandson:
"A little boy set out to find his
fortune. He met a factory worker
and asked if he knew where he

could find his fortune.
" 'No,' was the reply. Then he
met Death, and asked the same
question.
" 'Yes,' Death said. 'Come
along with me and I will show you
your fortune.'
"Now go to sleep!"
The point is dearly drawn. In a
world without a personal god who
cares enough to provide
atonement for our personal sins,
there is no hope but death — in
other words, no hope.
Narrowly, it applies to
Germans who complied with
Hitler's policies during World War
11. Broadly, as the film makes
clear, it extends to Americans
who complied with Vietnam — all

those too sinful to cast the first
stone at America, and even the
younger generation who long for
freedom from the curse of being
bloody Germans.
In short, it applies to the whole
"bloody" race.
The Pedestrian is, as the
description would indicate, quite
philosophical, quoting several
existentialist philosophers
theologians and poets in its
course. As is the wont of
existentialism, it finds sufficiency
in examining the dilemma of
mankind with sensitivity and
sadness, but little more.
After all, as the Bible says, if it
all ends in the grave anyway, what
more is there?
The Pedestrian, a German film
nominated for the Best Foreign
Film Oscar, is a poignant,
beautifully effected study of
death in a humanistic vortex.
Built around the story of a
leading German industrialist
politico's involvement in a My
Lai-type massacre in Greece
during World War 11, it is also a
