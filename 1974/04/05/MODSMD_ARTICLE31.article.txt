# One-Putting Murray Silences Golf Foes
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
"Everyone wants to be known
as a great striker of the ball,"
Gary Player once said. "Nobody
wants to be called a lucky,
one-putting 5.0.b., and nobody
thinks he is."
Stanford freshman Brent
Murray, a rare exception to
Player's truism, is a lucky,
one-putting s.o.b. who doesn't
mind honestly discussing his
strengths and weaknesses. "I don't
think I hit it too straight off the
tee and I don't hit my irons that
close," Murray admits, "but I putt
pretty good and just get it up and
down."
Murray, a pleasant surprise on
a team that was supposed to be
dominated by juniors, "got it up
and down" well enough last week
to finish sixth in a prestigious
102-man field at the Pacific Coast
Invitational. He shot 75-74-74 for
a 223 total, just two shots behind
champion Kevin Bench of Air
Force.
Today and tomorrow, Murray
will be one of Stanford's key
performers in the 54-hole Fresno
State Classic at Fort Washington
Golf Course.
"Brent thinks well," says
Stanford coach Bud Finger. "He
doesn't waste shots and he's
getting better all the time."
Teammate Dave Baskins
concurred: "Brent has a very
mature attitude on the course —
he thinks really well and rarely
makes mistakes."
Unemotional
Murray's mature golfing
attitude is the result of his
unusually unemotional nature.
"I'm pretty passive all around,"
he says."I don't get excited too
often — I never get mad."
Well, almost never. In a
tournament four years ago, Brent
hit a wayward tee shot and
slammed his driver against a tree.
The tree wasn't damaged, but the
driver was. "I was really mad at
myself," Murray recalls. "It cost
me a lot of money and I decided I
wouldn't blow up again."
Now, Brent's cool, quiet nature
continually amazes his coach and
teammates. Murray is so
soft-spoken, in fact, that Finger
carried on a 20-minute
conversation with him while
driving back from the Pacific
Coast tourney before realizing
that Brent was asleep in the back
seat.

Before the season started,
Murray didn't figure too
prominently in Finger's plans. He
played poorly in early fall
qualifying, and stumbled again in
the early winter test that
determined the starting lineup.
Kept Working
But Murray, the 1973 Oregon
high school champion, wasn't
discouraged. He continued to
practice, and worked his way into
the top six after the team's
opening loss to Cal. Since then
he's been a fixture in the starting
lineup, currently sporting the
fourth best competitive average
on the team (76.07).
Brent credits his improvement
to three factors: a minor swing
adjustment, more practice and
confidence. "Coach told me to
change the position of my hands
at the top of my swing," he said.
"I opened 'em up a little, which
has helped my consistency off the
tee. I'm also hitting more practice
balls than I ever have. But other
than that it's just more confidence
from playing more."
Still, Murray remains
unsatisfied with his current
golfing prowess. He grinned and
shrugged aside a question about a
possible professional career. "I'm
not good enough. If my game
improved a whole lot I might
consider it," but the probable
economics major from Portland
indicated that he has a long way
to go before even thinking about
the pro tour. "I'm just nowhere
near that calibre yet."
Nevertheless, Murray figures to
be a major factor in Stanford's
quest for national golf
prominence — both this year and
in his remaining three seasons at
the Farm. "If he keeps improving
at this rate," laughs Finger, "he'll
be shooting in the 50's by the
time he graduates."

UP AND DOWN—Freshman Brent Murray likes to think of himself as
an up-and-down golfer, meaning not that he's inconsistent, but that
one putt after his ball is up on the green, it's down in the hole. Murray
led the Stanford team last week at the Pacific Coast Invitational at
the Sand Piper Golf Course in Goleta.
