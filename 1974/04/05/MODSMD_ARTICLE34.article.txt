# Crew Team Favored To Win Cup
## 
### 
Stanford's crew teams will
participate against USC, Oregon
St., and Santa Clara tomorrow
morning at the Port of Redwood
City for the Con Findlay Cup.
Three races decide which
school will win the cup (OSU is
the defending champion).
Stanford coach Len Sherr is
optimistic about his team's
prospects to win this year's cup,
named for a former Olympic
rowing gold medalist who used to
coach Stanford.
The cup races are the freshman
eights, which begin at 8 a.m., the
junior varsity eights, 10, and the
varsity eights (10:30). Other races
are the freshman fours, (7:45),
and the varsity fours (8:30).
The Port of Redwood City is
located just off Harvard
Boulevard, which can be reached
by going north on the Bayshore
Freeway.
The favored Stanford varsity
consists of stroke Sam Francis,
Martin Cooney, Tim Odell, DAve
Glossbrenner, John Allured, Hank
Koerner, Rami Courtney and Kim
Nordstog, as well as coxswain
Corey Hayden.
