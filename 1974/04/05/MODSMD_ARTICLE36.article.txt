# Powerful USC Favored Over Stanford Spikers
## 
### MARK WHITE 
When Stanford's track team
shows up at the double-dual track
meet in Westwood tomorrow, the
Cardinals will be competing
against a team that very well
could nab the Pac-8 championship
and could be a threat to take the
1974 national crown.
Will the undermanned
Cardinals be taking on the UCLA
track Bruins, who, imitating their
basketball siblings, have
established a mini-dynasty in the
track universe? No. The Cards
will be tackling the USC Trojans,
who should be considered potential
usurpers in the Pac-8 scramble,
and who, if one looks at the
record books, have their own
dynasty to perpetuate.
Since their inclusion in the
Pac-8 in 1926, the Trojans have
won an unmatchable 25 league
championships, have finished
worse than second only four
times, and, during that 48-year
period, have won the national title
22 times. No other school has
come close to duplicating this
domination in track, nor in any
other collegiate sport.
Indeed, no team is more aware
of this historical Trojan
domination than Stanford's. In 37
straight meets, dating back to
1933, the Cardinals have bowed
to the Trojans in their annual
meetings, and, unfortunately,
tomorrow should yield the 38th
straight Cardinal loss to an
improved, multi-talented squad.
Last year's meet was the
closest the Cards came to breaking
the string. The Card's 73-80 loss
was the narrowest margin of
defeat since 1963, when Troy
prevailed 73-72.
"In last year's meet we were
the overwhelming underdog," said
coach Pay ton Jordan, "and they
[USC] may have been somewhat
complacent towards us. They
made some adjustments in their
personnel, running men where
they normally wouldn't have, and
we went after them event by
event.... To have any chance of
coming that close again, that is
the way we'll have to go after
them.
"USC is no longer the second
team in Los Angeles," Jordan

said. "When you have an Olympic
champion long jumper [Randy
Williams] taking second place on
the team [ to Gerald Hardeman ], a
triple jumper [Ed Washington]
who ranks among the nation's
best, three high hurdlers who do
13.9 or better and three or four
sprinters who consistently run
9.5, you've got to be good."
This season Williams, a gold
medalist in Munich and college LJ
record holder at 27-414, has been
jumping a half foot behind the
freshman Hardeman, who recently
jumped 26-1 l A and leads the list of
Pac-8 jumpers. Card Ken Kring
will be lucky to place behind this
talented duo, as the 23-11 l A
posted by Trojan Toddy
Hammond may portend an
impressive USC sweep.
Mike Hall, the only Card

ranked in the top eight Pac-8
triple jumpers, will have to be
aided by a small hurricane to
outdistance Washington, who has
gone 53-9. Dave Bagshaw will
need a lifetime best to assure
victory against Washington, Mike
Johnson, and Ogie Williams, each
of whom has run 13.9 in the 120
highs.
Three of the top four century
aces will also be racing tomorrow,
but unfortunately each will be
wearing maroon. Guy Abrahams,
Mike Shavers and David Thomas
maintain USC's traditional
excellence in the sprints, each
having run under 9.6 early this
season. Quartermiler Scott Wingo
will join the now healthy Otto
Rossner and Marvin Holmes in an
attempt to prevent a Trojan
Spring sweep.
Taking Wingo's place in the
440 will be Ken Curl, racing in the
quarter for the first time in several
seasons. John Kessel, who has
recently recovered from tonsillitis,
will join Curl in the battle against
USC's contingent of
quartermilers, all of whom have
been timed in under 48 seconds.
The Trojan quartet of Claude
Brown (47.7), Trevor Campbell
(46.8), Greg Jones (47.3) and
hurdler Andrews lead the Pac-8
mile relays with a 3:07.5 clocking,
13th on the alltime Pac-8 list.
Southern Cal's weaknesses lie
in the weight events and the
distances, and since Stanford is
also weak in the weights, the best
Cardinal opportunities for
victories are in the longer runs.
Tony Sandoval, voted
outstanding track athlete of the
week by sportwriters for his
double victory in the mile and
two-mile against Occidental last
Saturday, will run only the mile
against USC. If Sandy can
duplicate his early season times
(4:09.3), he should win the four
lapper.
Mark McConnell, ranked sixth
in the Pac-8 at 8:58.6, will give
SC's Steve Brown (8:55.0) a tussle
for first in the two-mile.

M ULTIPLE THREAT—Decathalon specialist Ken Kring will be
entered in at least two of his many specialties this Saturday against
USC at UCLA. Hell be in the long jump (top lifetime mark, 23-4 3/4)
and pole vault (lb-VA).
