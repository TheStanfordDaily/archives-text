# Cards Flawless On Film
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Through the magic of film-editing, the worst
player in Stanford's 1973 football highlights
movie was judged the nation's top performer
last fall.
While Stanford's players haul in passes, make
excruciating tackles, recover fumbles and bask
in the glorious Stanford Stadium sunshine
throughout the 30-minute film, John
Cappelletti's brief appearances are
embarrassing—at least for a Heisman Trophy
winner.
Bay Area sportswriters treated to a premier
showing of the movie yesterday watched
Cappelletti fumble, stumble and cringe—the
constant victim of Roger Stillwell's jarring
tackles. It seemed wondrous that Cappelletti
gained any yardage against the Cards last
September. It seemed miraculous that the
Nittany Lions triumphed, 20-6.
Of course the purpose of highlight films is to
accentuate the positive, and this effort by
sports information director Bob Murphy
certainly succeeds. Although Murphy admits
that it's "not the most professional film in the

world," countless Rotary Clubs, Little Leagues
and youth groups should enjoy the half hour of
highlights.
They'll see Craig Zaltosky weave his way
around and through San Jose State's porous
punt coverage for a 69-yard touchdown—a play
that narrator Murphy says not only turned
around the game, but also the season. They'll
see two electrifying kickoff returns by Ron Inge
against Oregon State, and Eric Test's pass to
Bill Singler on a flanker reverse against
Washington State.
They'll see Rod Garcia's record-breaking
59-yard field goal soar comfortably over the
Los Angeles Coliseum cross bar with at least 10
yards to spare. They'll see Singler snatch the
ball out of Oregon defender Steve Donnelly's
hands in the end zone. They'll see countless
Mike Boryla passes and Scott Laidlaw runs.
They'll be introduced to "the inimitable Forrie
Martin" — first on a motorcycle and then in the
middle of an opposing backfield.
And those fans interested in the total
Stanford football perspective will even see
famed heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway
applauding a Cardinal play on the sidelines. •
