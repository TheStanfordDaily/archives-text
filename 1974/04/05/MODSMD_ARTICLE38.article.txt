CINCINNATI (AP) â€” Relentless Hank
Aaron ascended into baseball's throne room
Thursday by whacking his 714 th career home
run to join Babe Ruth as the most prolific
slugger in history.
But the Cincinnati Reds erased a 6-1 deficit
and nipped the Atlanta Braves 7-5 in 11
innings.
The game was less than five minutes old
when the 40-year-old Aaron, a native of Mobile,
Ala., crashed his historic homer before a
sun-splashed crowd of 52,154, largest opening
day turnout in the 106-year history of
baseball's oldest team.
Aaron's 380-foot blast pulled him abreast of
a record once considered unattainable. The
record-tying feat came 30 years after Ruth
retired from the game he popularized.
An llth-hour addition to the lineup,
Aaron's historic homer came after considerable
dispute and drama. The question of his
availability spawned a feud with baseball
Commissioner Bow Kuhn and Braves' brass.
The team announced earlier this spring that
Aaron would be withheld until Atlanta's
home-opening series Monday.
The homer was his 96th off his favorite
victim and his first season-opening

round-tripper and came at 11:10 p.m., PDT.
A rousing ovation greeted Aaron in his initial
at-bat. Relief pitcher Jack Billingham, a
19-game winner last year, had started shakily,
walking Ralph Garr and yielding a single to
Mike Lum.
The 31-year-old right-hander ran the count
to 3-1. Aaron sent the next pitch over the
left-field fence near the 375-foot mark. He
jogged around the bases and was mobbed by his
teammates as he crossed the plate.
The ball was retrieved in a runway by a
Cincinnati policeman, Clarence Williams, and
presented to Aaron in a six-minute ceremony
near home plate.
Aaron certified the momentous feat by
going to the edge of the stands to kiss his wife,
Billye, his bride of five months,. Sitting with
her were Aaron's father and brother.
Aaron later grounded out to third base in
the third inning and walked in the fifth, later
scoring on an error. It was his 2,062 nd career
run scored, tying him for third place on that
all-time list with Willie Mays.
Aaron then lined out to center field in the
seventh inning and was removed from the game
in the bottom of the seventh with the Braves
leading 6-2.
