# USC Aluminum Drives Foes Batty
## Cards Meet Awesome Trojans Today 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
With five very successful
business concerns to direct one
would expect Rod Dedeaux to
spend his spare time playing golf
with his cronies or just relaxing by
the side of a pool. But Rod
Dedeaux isn't your ordinary
executive, he's the head baseball
coach at University of Southern
California. And, his contribution
to the USC program is so priceless
that his salary can be considered a
token. He is paid $1.00 per year
for his services.
Dedeaux brings his Trojans,
NCAA and Pacific-Eight champs
for the past-four years, to Sunken
Diamond this afternoon for a
2:30 game which opens a
three-game conference series. A
doubleheader is scheduled to
begin at noon tomorrow.
At the age of 59, after 32 years
of coaching at USC, one would
think that he would get tired

of collegiate baseball. However,
the case is quite the contrary.
"Golly, they don't give me time
to coach," says Dedeaux. "At
times I feel tired but at other
times 1 feel young again."
Dedeaux Field
In addition to his duties on the
field, Dedeaux handles recruiting
and fund-raising for his program.
One result of his efforts, other
than excellence in competition, is
the new baseball diamond, named,
appropriately, Dedeaux Field,
that will be inaugurated formally
May 10.
So far this season the Trojans
are 22-5, compared to Stanford's
10-15. USC is actually 22-3
against collegiate competition but
have lost to the California Angels
twice. USC's other losses were
against Arizona State 12-10,
UC-Irvine 9-3 and Santa Clara
10-2.
"We're struggling, though,"

said Dedeaux. "We're not a great
ball club. We lost four boys | to
the pros] we had anticipated to
play this year."
"We're more inexperienced
than in the past," said Dedeaux.
Today's lineup will be power
packed, six of the nine starters are
hitting over .300 and one of those
is over .400.
.455 Hitter
USC's leading hitter is senior
all-conference third baseman Rich
Dauer, currently at .455 (45 for
99). He leads the team in doubles
with 12, runs batted in with 45,
33 runs, scored and hasalsobelted
six home runs.
All-conference catcher Ed
Putman leads the team in home

runs with eight.
USC's lineup will be Creighton
Tevlin (.341), left field; Steve
Kemp (.395), designated hitter;
Dauer, third base; Ken Huizenga
(.244), center field; Putman
(.305), catcher; Marvin Cobb
(.376), shortstop; Anthony Davis
(.243) or Clif Holland, right field;
Tom Bhagwat (.359), first base
and Rob Adloph (.244), second
base.
Davis, a star running back on
the football team, is a doubtful
starter because of a hand injury,
according to Dedeaux.
Pitching Rotations
Russ McQueen, who threw a
no-hitter against Cal last Saturday,
is slated to pitch this afternoon

against Stanford's Dave Frost
(3-3). McQueen is 5-0 for the
year. "McQueen knows how to
pitch," said Dedeaux. "His biggest
asset is his control, he can move
the bail around."
Tomorrow's pitchers for USC
are Pete Redfern, a sophomore
right hander, and lefthander Jeff
Reinke.
Stanford's pitchers scheduled
for Saturday are AJ Arthur (1-5)
and Mike Williamson (2-2),
according to Stanford Head coach
Ray Young.
In sizing up the opposition
Young thinks that the Trojans
have good power but are not "a
great defensive club." Dedeaux
admits the defensive weakness
pointing out the inexperience in
the infield saying that "we're not
up to par."
"I can't understand the high
averages they have," said Young.
'The pitching must be awful this
year. That's ail I can conclude."
Dedeaux considers this year's
team not to be as strong as last
year's but cites this year's use of
aluminum bats as an equalizer.
"They [aluminum bats] make the
pitchers look bad. I don't think
that they should be used on the
college level."
Dedeaux isn't taking the Card
ballclub lightly saying, "They
certainly have to be one of the
toughest teams in the country.
Out here in the Pac-8 we play one
of the toughest schedules and the
best baseball in the nation.
Young's hopes rest on the
consistency of his players. "We
certianly have to be considered
the underdogs. We're very
inconsistent."

will be Andrew Willard and Rich
Domich.
With five very successful
business concerns to direct one
would expect Rod Dedeaux to
spend his spare time playing golf
with his cronies or just relaxing by
the side of a pool. But Rod
Dedeaux isn't your ordinary
executive, he's the head baseball
coach at University of Southern
California. And, his contribution
to the USC program is so priceless
that his salary can be considered a
token. He is paid $1.00 per year
for his services.
Dedeaux brings his Trojans,
NCAA and Pacific-Eight champs
for the past-four years, to Sunken
Diamond this afternoon for a
2:30 game which opens a
three-game conference series. A
doubleheader is scheduled to
begin at noon tomorrow.
At the age of 59, after 32 years
of coaching at USC, one would
think that he would get tired

of collegiate baseball. However,
the case is quite the contrary.
"Golly, they don't give me time
to coach," says Dedeaux. "At
times I feel tired but at other
times 1 feel young again."
Dedeaux Field
In addition to his duties on the
field, Dedeaux handles recruiting
and fund-raising for his program.
One result of his efforts, other
than excellence in competition, is
the new baseball diamond, named,
appropriately, Dedeaux Field,
that will be inaugurated formally
May 10.
So far this season the Trojans
are 22-5, compared to Stanford's
10-15. USC is actually 22-3
against collegiate competition but
have lost to the California Angels
twice. USC's other losses were
against Arizona State 12-10,
UC-Irvine 9-3 and Santa Clara
10-2.
"We're struggling, though,"

said Dedeaux. "We're not a great
ball club. We lost four boys | to
the pros] we had anticipated to
play this year."
"We're more inexperienced
than in the past," said Dedeaux.
Today's lineup will be power
packed, six of the nine starters are
hitting over .300 and one of those
is over .400.
.455 Hitter
USC's leading hitter is senior
all-conference third baseman Rich
Dauer, currently at .455 (45 for
99). He leads the team in doubles
with 12, runs batted in with 45,
33 runs, scored and hasalsobelted
six home runs.
All-conference catcher Ed
Putman leads the team in home

runs with eight.
USC's lineup will be Creighton
Tevlin (.341), left field; Steve
Kemp (.395), designated hitter;
Dauer, third base; Ken Huizenga
(.244), center field; Putman
(.305), catcher; Marvin Cobb
(.376), shortstop; Anthony Davis
(.243) or Clif Holland, right field;
Tom Bhagwat (.359), first base
and Rob Adloph (.244), second
base.
Davis, a star running back on
the football team, is a doubtful
starter because of a hand injury,
according to Dedeaux.
Pitching Rotations
Russ McQueen, who threw a
no-hitter against Cal last Saturday,
is slated to pitch this afternoon

against Stanford's Dave Frost
(3-3). McQueen is 5-0 for the
year. "McQueen knows how to
pitch," said Dedeaux. "His biggest
asset is his control, he can move
the bail around."
Tomorrow's pitchers for USC
are Pete Redfern, a sophomore
right hander, and lefthander Jeff
Reinke.
Stanford's pitchers scheduled
for Saturday are AJ Arthur (1-5)
and Mike Williamson (2-2),
according to Stanford Head coach
Ray Young.
In sizing up the opposition
Young thinks that the Trojans
have good power but are not "a
great defensive club." Dedeaux
admits the defensive weakness
pointing out the inexperience in
the infield saying that "we're not
up to par."
"I can't understand the high
averages they have," said Young.
'The pitching must be awful this
year. That's ail I can conclude."
Dedeaux considers this year's
team not to be as strong as last
year's but cites this year's use of
aluminum bats as an equalizer.
"They [aluminum bats] make the
pitchers look bad. I don't think
that they should be used on the
college level."
Dedeaux isn't taking the Card
ballclub lightly saying, "They
certainly have to be one of the
toughest teams in the country.
Out here in the Pac-8 we play one
of the toughest schedules and the
best baseball in the nation.
Young's hopes rest on the
consistency of his players. "We
certianly have to be considered
the underdogs. We're very
inconsistent."

will be Andrew Willard and Rich
Domich.
With five very successful
business concerns to direct one
would expect Rod Dedeaux to
spend his spare time playing golf
with his cronies or just relaxing by
the side of a pool. But Rod
Dedeaux isn't your ordinary
executive, he's the head baseball
coach at University of Southern
California. And, his contribution
to the USC program is so priceless
that his salary can be considered a
token. He is paid $1.00 per year
for his services.
Dedeaux brings his Trojans,
NCAA and Pacific-Eight champs
for the past-four years, to Sunken
Diamond this afternoon for a
2:30 game which opens a
three-game conference series. A
doubleheader is scheduled to
begin at noon tomorrow.
At the age of 59, after 32 years
of coaching at USC, one would
think that he would get tired

of collegiate baseball. However,
the case is quite the contrary.
"Golly, they don't give me time
to coach," says Dedeaux. "At
times I feel tired but at other
times 1 feel young again."
Dedeaux Field
In addition to his duties on the
field, Dedeaux handles recruiting
and fund-raising for his program.
One result of his efforts, other
than excellence in competition, is
the new baseball diamond, named,
appropriately, Dedeaux Field,
that will be inaugurated formally
May 10.
So far this season the Trojans
are 22-5, compared to Stanford's
10-15. USC is actually 22-3
against collegiate competition but
have lost to the California Angels
twice. USC's other losses were
against Arizona State 12-10,
UC-Irvine 9-3 and Santa Clara
10-2.
"We're struggling, though,"

said Dedeaux. "We're not a great
ball club. We lost four boys | to
the pros] we had anticipated to
play this year."
"We're more inexperienced
than in the past," said Dedeaux.
Today's lineup will be power
packed, six of the nine starters are
hitting over .300 and one of those
is over .400.
.455 Hitter
USC's leading hitter is senior
all-conference third baseman Rich
Dauer, currently at .455 (45 for
99). He leads the team in doubles
with 12, runs batted in with 45,
33 runs, scored and hasalsobelted
six home runs.
All-conference catcher Ed
Putman leads the team in home

runs with eight.
USC's lineup will be Creighton
Tevlin (.341), left field; Steve
Kemp (.395), designated hitter;
Dauer, third base; Ken Huizenga
(.244), center field; Putman
(.305), catcher; Marvin Cobb
(.376), shortstop; Anthony Davis
(.243) or Clif Holland, right field;
Tom Bhagwat (.359), first base
and Rob Adloph (.244), second
base.
Davis, a star running back on
the football team, is a doubtful
starter because of a hand injury,
according to Dedeaux.
Pitching Rotations
Russ McQueen, who threw a
no-hitter against Cal last Saturday,
is slated to pitch this afternoon

against Stanford's Dave Frost
(3-3). McQueen is 5-0 for the
year. "McQueen knows how to
pitch," said Dedeaux. "His biggest
asset is his control, he can move
the bail around."
Tomorrow's pitchers for USC
are Pete Redfern, a sophomore
right hander, and lefthander Jeff
Reinke.
Stanford's pitchers scheduled
for Saturday are AJ Arthur (1-5)
and Mike Williamson (2-2),
according to Stanford Head coach
Ray Young.
In sizing up the opposition
Young thinks that the Trojans
have good power but are not "a
great defensive club." Dedeaux
admits the defensive weakness
pointing out the inexperience in
the infield saying that "we're not
up to par."
"I can't understand the high
averages they have," said Young.
'The pitching must be awful this
year. That's ail I can conclude."
Dedeaux considers this year's
team not to be as strong as last
year's but cites this year's use of
aluminum bats as an equalizer.
"They [aluminum bats] make the
pitchers look bad. I don't think
that they should be used on the
college level."
Dedeaux isn't taking the Card
ballclub lightly saying, "They
certainly have to be one of the
toughest teams in the country.
Out here in the Pac-8 we play one
of the toughest schedules and the
best baseball in the nation.
Young's hopes rest on the
consistency of his players. "We
certianly have to be considered
the underdogs. We're very
inconsistent."
