# Profs: Attitude Change Possible
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Faculty in the Department of
Psychology here can only speculate on
whether Patricia Hearst's declaration
Wednesday that she would "stay and
fight" with the SLA resulted from an
actual attitude conversion, or from
coercion. But four professors told the
Daily yesterday that a conversion was
indeed possible given the
circumstances.
Prof. Philip Zimbardo observed that
"given the extent of contact she's had
with their thinking during the last 60
days, it's possible she could undergo a
change." Noting that the SLA has
maintained "total control over her
environment," Zimbardo suggested
that an attitude change on her part
might be no more dramatic than one
undergone by a newly-converted
"Jesus freak." Jesus fifcaks have often
converted in much less time and under
much less control, he added.
In Zimbardo's celebrated 1971
prison experiment, some normal
college students, divided arbitrarily "
into "prisoners" and "guards" in an
experimental prison, evidenced
considerable attitude change in less
than a week.
"If people who were normal and
stable underwent changes in six days,
why couldn't she [Hearst] in 60
days?" Zimbardo said.
Fear A Factor?
Zimbardo doubted that the possible
conversion in Patricia's attitudes could
be attributed to an identification with
her kidnapers out of fear. Some Jews
in Nazi concentration camps in World
War II reportedly exhibited such
identification, adopting the behavior
of their German guards in such things
as style of walking.
Zimbardo speculated that an
identification with the
"romantic . . . Robin Hood
movement" aspects of the SLA —
taking from the rich and giving to the
poor — might have moved Patricia
toward the SLA cause.

He emphasized that Patricia's
declaration that she would fight for
the SLA "may not be a question of
switching from one side do another.
Before [the kidnaping], she may not
have stood for anything. She might be
changing from a non-position to a
position."
Asst. Prof. Cedric (X) Clark added
that Patricia may have been
"predisposed toward a sympathetic
stance toward the SLA," suggesting
that her declaration may be "not so
much an attitude change as a
realization of her true self."
False Assumptions
"The Hearsts have led us to believe
her beliefs were antithetical to the
SLA cuase," Clark said. But on the
basis of Patricia's previous behavior,
her statements Wednesday "might not
represent such a radical shift."
Asst. Prof. Lee Ross cautioned
against the assumption that "if one
adopts the radical perspective, it might
be tnrough brainwashing.
* "Lots of young people with similar
socioeconomic and political
backgrounds [to Patricia Hearst] have
made that conversion without any of
the subtle and devious" methods that
some have attributed to the SLA, Ross
said.
Assoc. Prof. Daryl Bern, known for
his work in social psychology, delved
further into Patricia's previous
behavior, noting that "she has a
history of doing things that agitate her
parents." He noted that Patricia had
lived with her fiance, Steven Weed,
and that she "wouldn't come out as a
debutante" as her mother desired.
'Soft Sell'
Bern hypothesized that if Patricia
was actually ideologically converted to
the SLA, it was more likely by a "soft
sell" technique in which her kidnapers
allowed her to believe she spoke by
her own free will, without feeling she
was coerced.
The SLA could use coercion to
force Patricia to behave as they

wanted, but not to believe what they
wanted her to, Bern said.
Consistent with his self-perception
theory, which states that a person
won't believe what an "extraneous
reason" such as coercion forces him to
say, Bern suggested that to evoke
"maximum attitude change, the SLA
probably did not tell her what to say"
and "gave her as much latitude as
possible."
Bern noted that "it would be
politically more effective for the SLA
if she would be released and say all
those things she's been saying, in a
press conference. But if she was
coerced into her statements, she would
not do that."
But, had she undergone an attitude
change, the consideration that Patricia
"would never get back to the SLA"
once she was located might have
influenced her decision not to leave,
Bern added.

much less control, he added.
In Zimbardo's celebrated 1971
prison experiment, some normal
college students, divided arbitrarily "
into "prisoners" and "guards" in an
experimental prison, evidenced
considerable attitude change in less
than a week.
"If people who were normal and
stable underwent changes in six days,
why couldn't she [Hearst] in 60
days?" Zimbardo said.
Fear A Factor?
Zimbardo doubted that the possible
conversion in Patricia's attitudes could
be attributed to an identification with
her kidnapers out of fear. Some Jews
in Nazi concentration camps in World
War II reportedly exhibited such
identification, adopting the behavior
of their German guards in such things
as style of walking.
Zimbardo speculated that an
identification with the
"romantic . . . Robin Hood
movement" aspects of the SLA —
taking from the rich and giving to the
poor — might have moved Patricia
toward the SLA cause.

He emphasized that Patricia's
declaration that she would fight for
the SLA "may not be a question of
switching from one side do another.
Before [the kidnaping], she may not
have stood for anything. She might be
changing from a non-position to a
position."
Asst. Prof. Cedric (X) Clark added
that Patricia may have been
"predisposed toward a sympathetic
stance toward the SLA," suggesting
that her declaration may be "not so
much an attitude change as a
realization of her true self."
False Assumptions
"The Hearsts have led us to believe
her beliefs were antithetical to the
SLA cuase," Clark said. But on the
basis of Patricia's previous behavior,
her statements Wednesday "might not
represent such a radical shift."
Asst. Prof. Lee Ross cautioned
against the assumption that "if one
adopts the radical perspective, it might
be tnrough brainwashing.
* "Lots of young people with similar
socioeconomic and political
backgrounds [to Patricia Hearst] have
made that conversion without any of
the subtle and devious" methods that
some have attributed to the SLA, Ross
said.
Assoc. Prof. Daryl Bern, known for
his work in social psychology, delved
further into Patricia's previous
behavior, noting that "she has a
history of doing things that agitate her
parents." He noted that Patricia had
lived with her fiance, Steven Weed,
and that she "wouldn't come out as a
debutante" as her mother desired.
'Soft Sell'
Bern hypothesized that if Patricia
was actually ideologically converted to
the SLA, it was more likely by a "soft
sell" technique in which her kidnapers
allowed her to believe she spoke by
her own free will, without feeling she
was coerced.
The SLA could use coercion to
force Patricia to behave as they

wanted, but not to believe what they
wanted her to, Bern said.
Consistent with his self-perception
theory, which states that a person
won't believe what an "extraneous
reason" such as coercion forces him to
say, Bern suggested that to evoke
"maximum attitude change, the SLA
probably did not tell her what to say"
and "gave her as much latitude as
possible."
Bern noted that "it would be
politically more effective for the SLA
if she would be released and say all
those things she's been saying, in a
press conference. But if she was
coerced into her statements, she would
not do that."
But, had she undergone an attitude
change, the consideration that Patricia
"would never get back to the SLA"
once she was located might have
influenced her decision not to leave,
Bern added.

Faculty in the Department of
Psychology here can only speculate on
whether Patricia Hearst's declaration
Wednesday that she would "stay and
fight" with the SLA resulted from an
actual attitude conversion, or from
coercion. But four professors told the
Daily yesterday that a conversion was
indeed possible given the
circumstances.
Prof. Philip Zimbardo observed that
"given the extent of contact she's had
with their thinking during the last 60
days, it's possible she could undergo a
change." Noting that the SLA has
maintained "total control over her
environment," Zimbardo suggested
that an attitude change on her part
might be no more dramatic than one
undergone by a newly-converted
"Jesus freak." Jesus fifcaks have often
converted in much less time and under
much less control, he added.
