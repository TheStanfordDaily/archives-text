# Card JV's Respond To Young, Take Two
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's junior varsity
baseball team has had all the
stability of a floating crap game.
The JV's have been without a
head coach since last quarter, with
varsity coaches playing a game of
musical chairs in rotating the
managerial duties. Wednesday it
was varsity head man Ray
Young's assignment to coach the
JV's in a doubleheader against St.
Mary's on the Stanford JV
Diamond.
The Cards responded to
Young's appearance by winning
both contests, the first 4-0,
behind the two-hit pitching of Jim
Scharffenberger. They erupted for
nine runs in the first inning of the
nightcap to defeat the Gaels 12-1.
In the first inning
Scharffenberger appeared to be in
hot water or at least heading for
the hot water of the showers as he
gave up two hits and had runners
on first and second with no outs.
Scharffenberger toughened up,

allowing the Gaels no more hits
the rest of the day and the
industrious Cards loaded the
bases in the second inning on two
walks and a single to come up
with a 3-0 lead for him.
St. Mary's silenced the Cards
until the sixth inning when
Stanford capped the victory by
scoring another run on a walk to
John Mendez, who stole second
and scored on two wild pitches, to
give Stanford a 4-0 win.
The Cards sent ten batters to
the plate and came away with
nine runs on eight hits in the first
inning. With a 9-0 cushion, Bruce
Davis easily pitched his way
through four strong innings before
allowing the Gaels their only run
of the contest.
But the Cards weren't
through. Kevin Sullivan hit a two
run homer in the fifth inning to
ice the 12-1 victory.
The win gives the Cards a 10-7
overall mark and a 6-3 mark in the
Bay Area Collegiate League.
