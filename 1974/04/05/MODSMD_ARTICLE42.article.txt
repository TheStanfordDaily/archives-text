# Cardinal Netters Fear Upset In Matches At USC, UCLA
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's tennis team,
universally acclaimed as one of
the greatest menageries of talent
ever collected by a college, will
see today and tomorrow whether
it is only a paper tiger.
On paper, Stanford is the best,
no ifs, buts, or maybes. Going
down the lineup, there is no way
either UCLA or USC can match
the Cardinals when the teams
square off in Los Angeles today
and tomorrow.
But strange things have a way
of happening in L.A. Last year,
Stanford lost to both schools on
the road, bowing to UCLA
(today's opponent) 5-4 and USC
6-3. In fact, the Cards haven't
netted wins over both schools on
the same trip since 1942.
Of course, both schools are
weaker than last season. SC
doesn't have cool Raul Ramirez to

placidly zonk Stanford's finest
(he's turned pro), nor his doubles
partner, Mike Machette. UCLA
lost gutty Bob Kreiss and talented
Jeff Austin and Steve Krulevitz
through graduation.
Great Lineup
And so, without these chief
nemeses, how could either team
beat Stanford? Just look at the
Cards lineup.
One. Sandy Mayer. Period.
Then comes Jim Delaney,
National Amateur Grass Courts
champion. Third is the immensely
improved John Whitlinger. Some
measure of Stanford's depth is
shown by the fact that Pat DuPre,
National Amateur Clay Courts
champion, is playing fourth
singles.
Chico Hagey, a freshman
all-America selection who sat out
last year due to injury, has come
back into the fifth position.

Freshman Nick Saviano currently
holds the sixth spot, after having
been as low as ninth earlier in the
year.
To give you some idea of
Stanford's depth, last year "Sav"
beat USC's top player, John
Andrews.
New Bruin Look
So the Cards should be favored
to win both days. Today at
Westwood, UCLA will try to beat
the Cards with a much different
lineup than last year.
Sophomore Brain Teacher
should play first singles, barring
some fancy coaching trick.
Teacher last year extended Mayer
to 7-5 in the third set in the
NCAA's, the closest Mayer came
to being beat in the tourney. He
and Steve Mott form a proven
doubles team which could surprise
Mayer-Delaney, the NCAA
champs who haven't played
together since last June.
Freshman Ferdi Taygan, a high
school senior by age, will make his
debut against Stanford this
weekend. Taygan, national junior
clay court champion, is a top
prospect. He, Teacher and Mott
(who beat Andrews) all reached
the semis of last week's Southern
California Intercollegiates.
After those three, the lineup
includes Tom Kreiss, the third
brother who has starred for the

Bruins, Spencer Segura, son of pro
star Pancho, and freshman David
Parker, the reigning National
In terse ho I as tic champion.
This lineup is a potentially
great one, but no matter how
Coach Glenn Bassett juggles it, he
can't hind the fact that it's
probably Loo inexperienced to
beat Stanford if the Cards play as
well as they can.
International Flair
USC's lineup, despite the loss
of Mexico's Ramirez, has not lost
its distinctly international flavor
that makes it hard to predict how
well the team will do. Indian
Davis Cupper Sashi Menon will
probably play second singles, with
England's Mike Wevman and
Chile's Hans Gildermeister also in
the lineup.
The domestic part of the team
isn't bad, either, Andrews may
have lost to such players as Mott
and Saviano, but last year, he beat
Mayer at Ojai. The senior from
Fullerton moves up to the top slot
this year.
The other entrants include
freshman Butch Walts,
highest-ranked senior in the
country last year, and John
Holladay, a former high school
teammate of Hagey's who could
be matched against him
tomorrow.

CHICO'S BACK—Chico Hagey, an all-America selection as a freshman,
returns to the Stanford lineup today for his first big collegiate match
since the 1972 season. Hagey has made a very slow, but complete,
recovery from a broken ankle suffered at Forest Hills in 1972.
