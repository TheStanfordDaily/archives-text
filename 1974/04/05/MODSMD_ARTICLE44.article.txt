Tornadoes Sweep 13 Slates
DAYTON, Ohio — Rescue workers counted the dead
yesterday and tried to help the living rebuild after the
nation's worst tornado disaster in 49 years left more than
320 dead and thousands injured or homeless. Five states
were declared federal disaster areas; damage reached into
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The death toll in 11 states and Canada stood at 323.
"The destruction, the devastation is unbelievable," said
Vice President GeraJd R. Ford after flying over damaged
areas of Ohio. "You can see where the houses were reduced
to matches."
Hospitals overflowed. In Dayton, Ohio, near hard-hit
Xenia, ambulances arrived at Miami Valley Hospital at the
rate of one a minute in the hours just after the tornado.
Minor cases were treated in the hospital cafeteria. "We're
unable to do anything out of Xeniz," said radiologist
Shirley Kitchberg, returning to Dayton. "There's only one
portable x-ray. The rest of the power's out."
The tornadoes and related storms that struck late
Wednesday and early yesterday hit 13 Southern and
Midwestern states and Ontario, Canada. Whole communities
were turned into piles of rubble; more than 30 buildings at
the Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala., were
destroyed or damaged; a pastor died as he led prayers.
Whole communities in several states were without power
from the estimated 100 tornadoes which touched down
Wednesday afternoon and night. Two twisters hit a West
Virginia community yesterday.
Judiciary Committee Sets Deadline
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee,
declaring it has been patient long enough, has set a deadline
of next Tuesday for the White House to reply to its request
for tapes of 42 presidential conversations.
"We will supoena them if we must," said chairman Peter
Rodino, D-N.J., speaking for an apparently united
committee yesterday in the dispute over evidence the
committee wants for its impeachment inquiry.
Rodino's stemly worded message, delivered at the outset
of a committee meeting on the investigation, was fully
endorsed by Rep. Edward Hutchinson, R-Mich., the ranking
Republican on the committee, and other GOP members.
"We're not after irrelevant material," said Hutchinson.
"We're not after state secrets. We are merely after
information to help bring this matter to a conclusion."
The committee has been waiting since Feb. 25 for a
reply to its request for the recorded conversations between
President Nixon and his top aides last spring when the
Watergate cover-up was being exposed.

"We have been respectively patient," said Rodino. "The
House has been patient. The people have been patient for a
long, long time. The patience of this committee is now
wearing thin."
Convict Admits To Bugging Offer
SAN FRANCISCO — Convicted murderer Ronald Beaty
told a federal court that he volunteered to have an
electronic "bug" planted under his skin so he could secretly
gather evidence for the FBI against former Stanford Assoc.
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
Beaty testified Wednesday he made the offer to FBI
agents on Dec. 14, 1972—three days after his recapture
following an escape from Chino Prison. The FBI rejected
the offer.
Beaty, who is serving a life term for killing a guard
during his escape in October, 1972, is the prosecution's star
witness in the trial of Morton Newman, 31, of Mountain
View. Both are accused of harboring Beaty after his escape.
Franklin was arrested with Newman and Hobson, and an
FBI complaint alleged that Franklin masterminded Beaty's
escape. However, the complaint was dismissed in 1973 for
insufficient trial evidence.
Beaty was cross-examined Wednesday by Newman's
lawyer, William Osterhoudt, who attempted to depict Beaty
as a liar who tried to ingratiate himself with the FBI in
exchange for lenient treatment.
Beaty admitted he lied when he told agents that after his
escape, he was taken blindfolded to a cabin on orders by
Franklin.
Nixon Tax Decision Commended
WASHINGTON — A Senate-House investigating
committee closed its books on President Nixon's tax case
yesterday with a formal commendation for Nixon's
decision to pay some $465,000 in back taxes and interest.
Any further congressional action thus was left to the
House Judiciary Committee considering possible ground for
impeachment.
The Internal Revenue Service said in a statement late
yesterday that it did not feel civil fraud penalties against
the President were warranted, and it said that its audit of
the President's tax returns for 1969-72 was closed.
It is unusual for the IRS to issue any statements on an
individual's tax returns, but it said it was commenting
because of questions being received about the President's
returns.
The detailed report of the Joint Committee on Internal
Revenue Taxation, concluding that Nixon was deficient
$476,431 in back taxes and interest, will be considered
along with all other evidence in its inquiry, the Judiciary
Committee said.
Simon To Be Treasury Secretary?
WASHINGTON — Federal energy chief William E.
Simon will be nominated soon as the next secretary of the
Treasury, sources said yesterday, but will not be given the
full economic authority of his predecessor, George P.
Shultz.
Some of the authority that Shultz has had at the White
House — and much of his influence with the President — is
expected to fall to Budget Director Roy L. Ash, at least at
the beginning.
Well placed sources say dividing the authority between
Simon and Ash is sure to set off a power struggle for
authority over economic policy that could have an adverse
impact on the administration's ability to solve the nation's
economic problems.
President Nixon is expected to announce the Simon
nomination early next week, sources say. Simon would be
the fourth Treasury secretary in the Nixon administration.
