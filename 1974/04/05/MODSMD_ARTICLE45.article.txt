# C-15 ADJOURNS
## 
### 
The Committee of 15 (C-15), which is charged with
the responsibility of developing a new student judicial
system, last night voted to adjourn for the year,
according to a student C-15 member.
The 8-5 tally represented three administrators and
five faculty members voting for adjournment and five
students voting against. The C-15 could reconvene this
year only if a majority of the members agree to meet
again.
Last night's meeting was the second of the year.
There will be more information in Monday's
Daily.
