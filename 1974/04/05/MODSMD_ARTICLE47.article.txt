# Frenchman's Terrace Lawsuit Brings Varied Council Reactions
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Palo Alto City Council members
have expressed varying reactions to the
suit against Stanford over
Frenchman's Terrace filed Monday
by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
The NAACP has charged that the
proposed 225-unit Frenchman's
Terrace project designed to provide
housing for people of modest incomes
represents an illegal use of federal
money because extremely poor people
would not benefit from it.
"I am surprised that the suit was
filed," Councilman Alan Henderson
said. "No one indicated that the
Frenchman's Terrace project was out
of the ordinary."
Henderson said he has seen no
indication that the Frenchman's
Terrace project is a departure from
usual government policy regarding
federally funded projects.
Vice Mayor Enid Pearson agreed
that the suit was surprising, although
she noted that this is not the first time
that objections to the project have
been raised.
Doesn't Benefit Poor
"The question of whether or not
Frenchman's Terrace is a legally
justifiable project is an issue that has

bothered me terribly," Pearson said.
"Officials of HUD [Department of
Housing and Urban Development]
have claimed that certain provisions of
the project may not be proper, while
the University and the Urban Coalition
have assured us that the project is
legal."
Pearson said she generally agrees
with the assertion of the NAACP that
the project is not a real benefit to the
poor.
"Frenchman's Terrace is not a
project that addresses itself to the real
needs of the poor," she said, pointing
out that 40 percent of the units in the
proposed complex are offered at
market prices.
But Councilman John Berwald
disagreed with the NAACP, stating
that if market-priced housing weren't
included in the project, Frenchman's
Terrace would become a ghetto.
"If all of the units were designed
for low income occupants, the project
would be abandoned in five years,
reduced to a ghetto," he said.
Berwald praised the intentions of
the University in planning
Frenchman's Terrace.
University Land For Housing
"The University has chosen to use
its own land to provide housing for its
own employees and for low income

members of the general community,"
BerwaJd noted. "That is a step in the
right direction."
Berwald said that while the NAACP
is a "responsible organization," the
tactic of bringing the matter of
Frenchman's Terrace to court is a
"divisive and delaying approach" that
will hurt the poor people of the Palo
Alto area.
None of the City Council members
contacted by the Daily stated that
they believed that the lawsuit would
influence the Council in its decision
regarding whether or not to annex the
land on which the project would be
built. The University has asked the
Council to annex the land in order
that the University wouldn't have to
bear the burden of providing
municipal services to the project.
Ira Hall, executive director of the
Mid-peninsula Urban Coalition, said
yesterday that he hopes to confer with
representatives of the NAACP to
discover its objectives.
"The motivation of the NAACP is
unclear," Hall said. "We have been
working on the Frenchman's Terrace
project for years, and have
disseminated information on its
organization. We are surprised that the
NAACP didn't protest the plan at an
earlier time."

Alto area.
None of the City Council members
contacted by the Daily stated that
they believed that the lawsuit would
influence the Council in its decision
regarding whether or not to annex the
land on which the project would be
built. The University has asked the
Council to annex the land in order
that the University wouldn't have to
bear the burden of providing
municipal services to the project.
Ira Hall, executive director of the
Mid-peninsula Urban Coalition, said
yesterday that he hopes to confer with
representatives of the NAACP to
discover its objectives.
"The motivation of the NAACP is
unclear," Hall said. "We have been
working on the Frenchman's Terrace
project for years, and have
disseminated information on its
organization. We are surprised that the
NAACP didn't protest the plan at an
earlier time."
Palo Alto City Council members
have expressed varying reactions to the
suit against Stanford over
Frenchman's Terrace filed Monday
by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
The NAACP has charged that the
proposed 225-unit Frenchman's
Terrace project designed to provide
housing for people of modest incomes
represents an illegal use of federal
money because extremely poor people
would not benefit from it.
"I am surprised that the suit was
filed," Councilman Alan Henderson
said. "No one indicated that the
Frenchman's Terrace project was out
of the ordinary."
Henderson said he has seen no
indication that the Frenchman's
Terrace project is a departure from
usual government policy regarding
federally funded projects.
Vice Mayor Enid Pearson agreed
that the suit was surprising, although
she noted that this is not the first time
that objections to the project have
been raised.
Doesn't Benefit Poor
"The question of whether or not
Frenchman's Terrace is a legally
justifiable project is an issue that has

bothered me terribly," Pearson said.
"Officials of HUD [Department of
Housing and Urban Development]
have claimed that certain provisions of
the project may not be proper, while
the University and the Urban Coalition
have assured us that the project is
legal."
Pearson said she generally agrees
with the assertion of the NAACP that
the project is not a real benefit to the
poor.
"Frenchman's Terrace is not a
project that addresses itself to the real
needs of the poor," she said, pointing
out that 40 percent of the units in the
proposed complex are offered at
market prices.
But Councilman John Berwald
disagreed with the NAACP, stating
that if market-priced housing weren't
included in the project, Frenchman's
Terrace would become a ghetto.
"If all of the units were designed
for low income occupants, the project
would be abandoned in five years,
reduced to a ghetto," he said.
Berwald praised the intentions of
the University in planning
Frenchman's Terrace.
University Land For Housing
"The University has chosen to use
its own land to provide housing for its
own employees and for low income

members of the general community,"
BerwaJd noted. "That is a step in the
right direction."
Berwald said that while the NAACP
is a "responsible organization," the
tactic of bringing the matter of
Frenchman's Terrace to court is a
"divisive and delaying approach" that
will hurt the poor people of the Palo
Alto area.
