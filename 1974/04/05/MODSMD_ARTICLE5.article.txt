# Draw Preliminaries Begin Tuesday
## Housing Priorities Altered 
### JOHN FREED 
Premiminaries to the April 16-19 round one
housing draw begin Tuesday with open houses
at residences on the west end of campus.
Changes in the draw include relocation of the
black and native American programs, as well as
new methods of obtaining housing priorities and
the addition of a house to the draw.
The new house, located at 584 Mayfield
Ave., will become one of the Grove houses,
according to Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs.
"The house used to be the old Theta Delta
Chi house. For the past eight-10 years, it's been
used as a research institute. I believe it will be
one of the nicest houses on campus this
autumn," Horton stated. The house will
undergo renovation this summer, becoming a
permanent addition to the student-residence
system. Delt House will leave the system, going
to the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Responsibility for notifying the University of
housing priorities will no longer rest with house
managers in this year's draw. Individual
undergraduates will receive computerized
priority cards and will be expected to turn them
in when drawing a random number, trying to
obtain a spot in the University housing system.
'Draw Booklet'
. Details of the draw system and new priority
procedures appear in "Stanford Residences:
1974-75," the so-called "draw booklet", which
was distributed yesterday. Additional copies are
available at the housing office in Old Union.
Two of the four minority students' living
programs will operate out of new locations next
year. The native American program house will
be at Gavilan in Florence Moore, moving from
Soto in Wilbur. The black program house will

shift from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia at Lagunita.
That move was announced Tuesday.
Associate Dean Horton explained why
residents of Olivo-Magnolia were not informed
that their house was being considered for the
move.
"Lagunita was not seriously considered [as a
location for the black students' program] until
Thursday of finals week. The final decision was
not made until 9 a.m. Tuesday. There was a
possibility it could be at Eucalypto-Granada [in
Lagunita] until Tuesday morning," he said.
Carefully Thought Out
Although the decision-making process
spanned only two weeks, Horton claimed the
alternatives and the final decision were carefully
thought out.
"It was a thoroughly considered decision. We
spent as much time during the two weeks as we
would have in two months had we had more
time to consider the decision," Horton said.
"I cannot avoid the responsibility for saying
'yes' or 'no' on matters like this," he added.
Blacks had priorities for 40 percent of the
spaces at Roble, though only about
three-fourths of these were filled at the end of
winter quarter. Fully 50 percent of spaces at
Olivo-Magnolia will have priorities for blacks,
however. Horton explained the effect this may
have.
Size A Key Factor
"The dynamics of a place like Roble, with
270 students in 11 corridors in three big wings
with two dining rooms—well, the size is just a
key factor. I think, both in social interaction
and the political situation, things should be
better |at Olivo-Magnolia]Horton elaborated.
He asserted that the program will be a success
at Olivo-Magnolia only if all of the residents are

satisfied.
"The program will not be a success if half
(the residents] are satisfied and half are not,"
Horton concluded He hinted that intra-house
conflicts between white and black students
contributed to shifting the location of the
blacks' program.
Roble Unsatisfactory
"We have been aware for some time that the
situation in Roble is pretty unsatisfactory. White
tL.re have been no ugly overt incidents, there
has been tension over such issues as 'what kind
of band do you hire for parties?'
"Black students came to the Dean [Lyons]
to voice their complaints. White students,
members of the residence staff, and the resident
fellow also all came to me and said roughly the
same thing, so I think we have a pretty clear
picture of what the situation really is," Horton
contended. He contrasted this with some
persons' reactions at Olivo-Magnolia.
"I was gratified at the number of people
Tuesday night who spoke in favor of the move.
Some [Olivo-Magnolians] are anxious now
because they don't know what's going to be.
They will not be anxious afterwards," he
assured.
The total number of blacks involved in the
program house will decline next year, according
to Horton, because priorities will be granted for
just half of the 118 spaces available.
"There will clearly be black students who
will not get into Olivo-Magnolia next year,
assuming that all the students now in the
program request priorities," Horton said.
Total number of spaces available in the entire
undergraduate housing draw will remain about
the same, according to Keith Kintigh of the
Housing Office.

Size A Key Factor
"The dynamics of a place like Roble, with
270 students in 11 corridors in three big wings
with two dining rooms—well, the size is just a
key factor. I think, both in social interaction
and the political situation, things should be
better |at Olivo-Magnolia]Horton elaborated.
He asserted that the program will be a success
at Olivo-Magnolia only if all of the residents are

satisfied.
"The program will not be a success if half
(the residents] are satisfied and half are not,"
Horton concluded He hinted that intra-house
conflicts between white and black students
contributed to shifting the location of the
blacks' program.
Roble Unsatisfactory
"We have been aware for some time that the
situation in Roble is pretty unsatisfactory. White
tL.re have been no ugly overt incidents, there
has been tension over such issues as 'what kind
of band do you hire for parties?'
"Black students came to the Dean [Lyons]
to voice their complaints. White students,
members of the residence staff, and the resident
fellow also all came to me and said roughly the
same thing, so I think we have a pretty clear
picture of what the situation really is," Horton
contended. He contrasted this with some
persons' reactions at Olivo-Magnolia.
"I was gratified at the number of people
Tuesday night who spoke in favor of the move.
Some [Olivo-Magnolians] are anxious now
because they don't know what's going to be.
They will not be anxious afterwards," he
assured.
The total number of blacks involved in the
program house will decline next year, according
to Horton, because priorities will be granted for
just half of the 118 spaces available.
"There will clearly be black students who
will not get into Olivo-Magnolia next year,
assuming that all the students now in the
program request priorities," Horton said.
Total number of spaces available in the entire
undergraduate housing draw will remain about
the same, according to Keith Kintigh of the
Housing Office.
Premiminaries to the April 16-19 round one
housing draw begin Tuesday with open houses
at residences on the west end of campus.
Changes in the draw include relocation of the
black and native American programs, as well as
new methods of obtaining housing priorities and
the addition of a house to the draw.
The new house, located at 584 Mayfield
Ave., will become one of the Grove houses,
according to Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs.
"The house used to be the old Theta Delta
Chi house. For the past eight-10 years, it's been
used as a research institute. I believe it will be
one of the nicest houses on campus this
autumn," Horton stated. The house will
undergo renovation this summer, becoming a
permanent addition to the student-residence
system. Delt House will leave the system, going
to the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Responsibility for notifying the University of
housing priorities will no longer rest with house
managers in this year's draw. Individual
undergraduates will receive computerized
priority cards and will be expected to turn them
in when drawing a random number, trying to
obtain a spot in the University housing system.
'Draw Booklet'
. Details of the draw system and new priority
procedures appear in "Stanford Residences:
1974-75," the so-called "draw booklet", which
was distributed yesterday. Additional copies are
available at the housing office in Old Union.
Two of the four minority students' living
programs will operate out of new locations next
year. The native American program house will
be at Gavilan in Florence Moore, moving from
Soto in Wilbur. The black program house will

shift from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia at Lagunita.
That move was announced Tuesday.
Associate Dean Horton explained why
residents of Olivo-Magnolia were not informed
that their house was being considered for the
move.
"Lagunita was not seriously considered [as a
location for the black students' program] until
Thursday of finals week. The final decision was
not made until 9 a.m. Tuesday. There was a
possibility it could be at Eucalypto-Granada [in
Lagunita] until Tuesday morning," he said.
Carefully Thought Out
Although the decision-making process
spanned only two weeks, Horton claimed the
alternatives and the final decision were carefully
thought out.
"It was a thoroughly considered decision. We
spent as much time during the two weeks as we
would have in two months had we had more
time to consider the decision," Horton said.
"I cannot avoid the responsibility for saying
'yes' or 'no' on matters like this," he added.
Blacks had priorities for 40 percent of the
spaces at Roble, though only about
three-fourths of these were filled at the end of
winter quarter. Fully 50 percent of spaces at
Olivo-Magnolia will have priorities for blacks,
however. Horton explained the effect this may
have.

Responsibility for notifying the University of
housing priorities will no longer rest with house
managers in this year's draw. Individual
undergraduates will receive computerized
priority cards and will be expected to turn them
in when drawing a random number, trying to
obtain a spot in the University housing system.
'Draw Booklet'
. Details of the draw system and new priority
procedures appear in "Stanford Residences:
1974-75," the so-called "draw booklet", which
was distributed yesterday. Additional copies are
available at the housing office in Old Union.
Two of the four minority students' living
programs will operate out of new locations next
year. The native American program house will
be at Gavilan in Florence Moore, moving from
Soto in Wilbur. The black program house will

shift from Roble to Olivo-Magnolia at Lagunita.
That move was announced Tuesday.
Associate Dean Horton explained why
residents of Olivo-Magnolia were not informed
that their house was being considered for the
move.
"Lagunita was not seriously considered [as a
location for the black students' program] until
Thursday of finals week. The final decision was
not made until 9 a.m. Tuesday. There was a
possibility it could be at Eucalypto-Granada [in
Lagunita] until Tuesday morning," he said.
Carefully Thought Out
Although the decision-making process
spanned only two weeks, Horton claimed the
alternatives and the final decision were carefully
thought out.
"It was a thoroughly considered decision. We
spent as much time during the two weeks as we
would have in two months had we had more
time to consider the decision," Horton said.
"I cannot avoid the responsibility for saying
'yes' or 'no' on matters like this," he added.
Blacks had priorities for 40 percent of the
spaces at Roble, though only about
three-fourths of these were filled at the end of
winter quarter. Fully 50 percent of spaces at
Olivo-Magnolia will have priorities for blacks,
however. Horton explained the effect this may
have.
Size A Key Factor
"The dynamics of a place like Roble, with
270 students in 11 corridors in three big wings
with two dining rooms—well, the size is just a
key factor. I think, both in social interaction
and the political situation, things should be
better |at Olivo-Magnolia]Horton elaborated.
He asserted that the program will be a success
at Olivo-Magnolia only if all of the residents are

satisfied.
"The program will not be a success if half
(the residents] are satisfied and half are not,"
Horton concluded He hinted that intra-house
conflicts between white and black students
contributed to shifting the location of the
blacks' program.
Roble Unsatisfactory
"We have been aware for some time that the
situation in Roble is pretty unsatisfactory. White
tL.re have been no ugly overt incidents, there
has been tension over such issues as 'what kind
of band do you hire for parties?'
"Black students came to the Dean [Lyons]
to voice their complaints. White students,
members of the residence staff, and the resident
fellow also all came to me and said roughly the
same thing, so I think we have a pretty clear
picture of what the situation really is," Horton
contended. He contrasted this with some
persons' reactions at Olivo-Magnolia.
"I was gratified at the number of people
Tuesday night who spoke in favor of the move.
Some [Olivo-Magnolians] are anxious now
because they don't know what's going to be.
They will not be anxious afterwards," he
assured.
The total number of blacks involved in the
program house will decline next year, according
to Horton, because priorities will be granted for
just half of the 118 spaces available.
"There will clearly be black students who
will not get into Olivo-Magnolia next year,
assuming that all the students now in the
program request priorities," Horton said.
Total number of spaces available in the entire
undergraduate housing draw will remain about
the same, according to Keith Kintigh of the
Housing Office.
