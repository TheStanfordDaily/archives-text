# Conservative Debates Methods Of Change

### GEORGE TIBBITS 
Social revolutions are doomed to
failure, conservative spokesman Will
Herberg said last night, because "they
attempt to do the impossibleâ€” remake
man in a new social vision."
Speaking before approximately 200
people in Bishop Auditorium on
"Social Change, Revolution and the
Policy of Benign Neglect," Herberg, a
philosophy professor at Drew
University and the Religion Editor of
National Review, contrasted the
conservative approach to social change
to those of liberal and radical
viewpoints.
Pointing out that social change is
"an inescapable aspect of every human
society," Herberg said that the real
question was whether this change is

accomplished according to law and
custom or according to abstract
principles.
Social revolution, which he defined
as a "power-enforced sudden
transformation of the total structure
of society," always fails, he said,
because it is based on the false logic
that man and society can be remade
into a Utopian vision through the
organized use of force.
'Social Radicalism'
He defined liberalism as "a
mitigated form of social radicalism"
which also involves a program of social
revolution, but one based on a
government-enforced, bureaucratic
program of gradual social reform
according to an ideological scheme.
But this bureaucratic state, he said,
generates backlash.
He cited the backlash to busing
children to achieve racial balances in
schools as an example.
In contrast, he said conservatism
relies on the inner forces of history
and society to improve conditions and
bring about change. He advocated a
policy of "benign neglect," allowing
forces such as the "impersonal
mechanism of the market" and the
"invisible operation of custom and
social tradition" to improve situations,
with the help of small-scale, short-term
social reforms.
Advocates Caution
For the prudent social conservative,
Herberg said, the best line of action
was expressed by Kingsley
Amis: "Do the best you can to keep
things going and make whatever
improvements are possible. If you try
to go too fast and too far, you will get
nowhere."
A panel of three Stanford
professors, Alex Inkeles, David
Kennedy and Sidney Hook, offered
rebuttal to Herberg's talk. Inkeles
disagreed that revolutions are always
associated with utopianism and that
liberalism always involves uprooting
social traditions.
Kennedy objected to the notions
that "at least in abstract, all custom
and tradition is good," and that
liberalism solely represents change
according to an ideological scheme.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he said,
wanted change in the Soviet system,
but not because he was a Utopian.
Hook said that he "found nothing I
would really agree with" in Herberg's
position. "If what we heard was an
exposition of conservatism, I think it
is a bankrupt philosophy," he said. "It
gives no guide to the problems we face
today."
