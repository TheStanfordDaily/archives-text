## ASSU Deadlock 
### 
The Daily Editorial Board finds itself deadlocked on the
matter of endorsing a slate of candidates for the ASSU
Presidency.
Half the Editorial Board endorses the slate of Mike
Herman, Ann Carter, Leonard Mackey and Quinn Mayer;
half endorses the slate of 800 Bacon, Chris Baron, Jack
Handy and Maria Echaveste. The entire Board found none of
the other four slates acceptable.
Those favoring the slate headed by Bacon believe its
members show a record of solid accomplishments in
University affairs - inside the ASSU, but more often
without.
Handy, who is especially capable, has taken a leading role
in the establishment here of Ralph Nader's suggested Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG). Baron's direction of the
Prison Information Center has revealed that she is a person
of great organizational ability, and her work on the SWOPSI
Policy Board has been especially valuable in keeping that
important program vigorous.
Perhaps most important, their platform reveals a welcome
understanding of the limited capabilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
In marked contrast, they believe, is the massive program
of the Herman slate: wide-ranging, pretty-sounding, but
almost surely impossible to implement. Moreover, they
believe the Herman slate has no record of solid
accomplishments — beyond amassing empty ASSU titles.
Those favoring the slate headed by Herman think this
industrious group presents various concrete proposals which
would benefit all students — not just special interest groups.
Their suggestions were set forth in a lucid 44-page
statement, backed up with facts and figures. Apparently, the
Herman slate knows how to go about implementing as well
as generating ideas.
Among the plans supported by the Herman group are
those to begin a Stanford Student Store (a discount outfit
along the lines of the Harvard Coop) and to establish a
lecture note service. These ideas have been offered before,
but the Herman slate presents what seems to be viable ways
of organizing and financing the programs.
It has been said that any group, given sufficient time and
energy, could produce 44 pages of well thought out
proposals, given the chance. In fact, all slates have been
given the chance, but only the Herman slate has produced.
What's more, their statement is evidence of a solid team
effort.
It is the contention of this half of the editorial board that
the Bacon slate would not be able to work as well as a team.
The group is composed of a black, chicana, white male and
white female, and could easily fragment, as did this year's
O'Grady Council. The members of this slate may spend their
time crusading in favor of political and social issues rather
than on working to benefit all students.
