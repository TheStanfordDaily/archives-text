The U.S. Senate recently
passed a bill, SIB6B, that could
have a significant effect on future
relationships between the United
States and the courageous peoples
seeking self determination in
Southern Africa.
Bill SlB6B was submitted by
Sen. McGee, Dâ€”Wyo., in an
effort to repeal the controversial
Byrd Amendment. The Byrd
Amendment was one of a series of
bills passed during the Nixon
administration that has severely
strained the relationship between
the United States and many
African nations.
The Byrd Amendment allowed
the illegal importation of chrome
ore into the U.S. from Rhodesia.
The Byrd Amendment clearly
violated international sanctions of
the United Nations which strictly
prohibited all member states from
engaging in economic, political or
military transactions with the
illegal lan Smith regime. In
addition, it is in violation of the
United Nations Participation Act
of 1945.
Minority Regime
Rhodesia is presently
controlled by a white minority
regime, led by lan Smith, which
illegally declared itself
independent from Britain on Nov.
11, 1965. The regime has
persistently violated the rights of
the African majority. (Population
statistics indicate that the 5.5
million Africans are ruled by less
than 260,000 white Rhodesians.)
The regime has done this
through its racist policies and by
not allowing the African majority
to express its will through "one
man, one vote" elections.

In addition, the regime has
detained many of the popularly
recognized African leaders,
particularly Joshua Nkomo and
Noabagingi Sithole, respective
leaders of the Zimbabwe African
People's Union (ZAPU) and the
Zimbabwe African National
Union (ZANU).
Regime Not Recognized
The significance of these events
with respect to the U.S. is that the
Smith regime is not recognized as
the legitimate heir to power by
any member state of the United
Nations. Through the Byrd
Amendment the U.S. is
encouraging the existence of the
illegal regime by providing the
financial resources necessary to
maintain it's economic and
political stability.
Furthermore, it is an
acknowledged fact that the U.S.
stockpile of chrome ore is capable
of meeting the needs of the
government and that there is no
need to rely on the illegal regime
for chrome ore.
Our efforts in this matter could
lead to the repeal of the Byrd
Amendment. The U.S. House of
Representatives will be voting on
Bill HR 8005 shortly. It is
important that we immediately
write, call, or send a telegram to
our respective representatives
encouraging them to pass Bill
HR 8005 and repeal the Byrd
Amendment without delay. Such
efforts would be a sound starting
ground in improving the
international credibility of the
United States.

vice-president.)
