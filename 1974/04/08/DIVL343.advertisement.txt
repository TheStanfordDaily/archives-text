HOUSING DRAW PETITIONS
Students not currently living in University housing must petition to
participate in next week's Undergraduate Housing Draw by Friday,
April 12. Petitions are available at the Single Student Housing
Office, 3rd floor Old Union.

The Summary Table in the 1974 Draw Book fails to mention that Jordan House
is a cooperative requiring a special sign-up procedure in order to obtain a
priority card to draw into the House. The description of Jordan House on page
13 of the Draw Book is correct.
