# Patricia's Parents Leave For Mexico
## 
### 
HILLSBOROUGH (AP) - The
weary parents of Patricia Hearst left
here yesterday for a visit to Mexico.
Their exact destination and the
purpose of the trip were not known,
but a friend said the Hearsts were not
heading for a rendezvous with their
daughter's kidnapers.
Ira Walsh, a family friend, said he
drove Randolph and Catherine Hearst
to San Francisco International Airport
before dawn yesterday.
Asked whether the Hearsts were
going to a meeting with the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA),
which claims to have kidnaped Patricia
on Feb. 4, Walsh replied: "I know
there's nothing."
Walsh said he expected the Hearsts
to return to their Hillsborough home
within 10 days. He said they might
meet their daughter Virginia, 24, and
son-in-law Jay Bosworth at an
undisclosed spot in Mexico.
The Hearst family holdings
reportedly include property in
northern Mexico near Monterrey and in
southern Mexico near Mazatlan.
Hearst Regroups
"Randy said to me he's gone to
regroup and kind of get it together and
try to find out where he can go from
here," said nephew William Randolph
Hearst 111.
"He doesn't really want to be in
this house and he doesn't know what
to do so he is going somewhere where
he can think about it a little more,"
said Hearst.
He said they would return
immediately if there was any new
word about Patricia.
New York Trip
Two weeks ago the Hearsts flew to
New York for a board meeting of the
Hearst Corp., which has pledged $4
million for a second free food
giveaway if his daughter is freed
unharmed by May 3.
That had been their only excursion
outside the San Francisco area, where
they have maintained an exhausting
und fruitless vigil since Patricia was
kidnaped.

In an interview Saturday, Hearst
said he believes his 20-year-old
daughter has been brainwashed by her
SLA kidnapers — whom he labeled
"cruel people."
"I don't think she's been put in
tiger cages or anything like that," he
said. "I just think that after 60 days
you can change people's opinion. And
if that's brainwashing, I would say
yes."
Renounces Family
In a taped message broadcast last
Wednesday, Patricia renounced her
family and said she was joining her
SLA captors as an armed comrade.
The previous day, the SLA had said it
would be announcing the time and
place of her release within 72 hours.
Hearst said Saturday: "To put out a
tape one day saying they're going to
release her and then a day later put
out one saying she's joined them is —
you know — just plain cruel.
"I think they're just cruel people
and I think that they fundamentally
hate this society so much that they
think anything's fair," he said.

weary parents of Patricia Hearst left
here yesterday for a visit to Mexico.
Their exact destination and the
purpose of the trip were not known,
but a friend said the Hearsts were not
heading for a rendezvous with their
daughter's kidnapers.
Ira Walsh, a family friend, said he
drove Randolph and Catherine Hearst
to San Francisco International Airport
before dawn yesterday.
Asked whether the Hearsts were
going to a meeting with the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA),
which claims to have kidnaped Patricia
on Feb. 4, Walsh replied: "I know
there's nothing."
Walsh said he expected the Hearsts
to return to their Hillsborough home
within 10 days. He said they might
meet their daughter Virginia, 24, and
son-in-law Jay Bosworth at an
undisclosed spot in Mexico.
The Hearst family holdings
reportedly include property in
northern Mexico near Monterrey and in
southern Mexico near Mazatlan.
Hearst Regroups
"Randy said to me he's gone to
regroup and kind of get it together and
try to find out where he can go from
here," said nephew William Randolph
Hearst 111.
"He doesn't really want to be in
this house and he doesn't know what
to do so he is going somewhere where
he can think about it a little more,"
said Hearst.
He said they would return
immediately if there was any new
word about Patricia.
New York Trip
Two weeks ago the Hearsts flew to
New York for a board meeting of the
Hearst Corp., which has pledged $4
million for a second free food
giveaway if his daughter is freed
unharmed by May 3.
That had been their only excursion
outside the San Francisco area, where
they have maintained an exhausting
und fruitless vigil since Patricia was
kidnaped.

In an interview Saturday, Hearst
said he believes his 20-year-old
daughter has been brainwashed by her
SLA kidnapers — whom he labeled
"cruel people."
"I don't think she's been put in
tiger cages or anything like that," he
said. "I just think that after 60 days
you can change people's opinion. And
if that's brainwashing, I would say
yes."
Renounces Family
In a taped message broadcast last
Wednesday, Patricia renounced her
family and said she was joining her
SLA captors as an armed comrade.
The previous day, the SLA had said it
would be announcing the time and
place of her release within 72 hours.
Hearst said Saturday: "To put out a
tape one day saying they're going to
release her and then a day later put
out one saying she's joined them is —
you know — just plain cruel.
"I think they're just cruel people
and I think that they fundamentally
hate this society so much that they
think anything's fair," he said.
