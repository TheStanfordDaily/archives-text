# Herman Slate--Feasible Proposals
## 
### 
Dorsey, Garvin, Kauser

As students interested in the potential
effectiveness of a dedicated and organized
ASSU government, we are writing to
encourage support of the
Herman-Carter-Mackey-Mayer slate.
While there are surely sincere, competent
individuals on other slates, we think that the
Herman group clearly offers the best
combination of experience in University
affairs and concrete, feasible ideas for the
future.
We question the assertion by some
members of the Daily editorial board that the
Herman slate has simply amassed "empty
ASSU titles." That charge could be leveled at
most of the students campaigning in this
election if one believed service on University
committees and ASSU projects amounted to
nothing, but then there would be little
purpose in having either elections or an
ASSU.
It is unfortunate that expense limitations
preclude campus-wide distribution of the
complete set of proposals of the Herman
slate.
Thorough Detail
The proposals are presented in adequately
thorough detail to reveal the feasibility of the
ideas, while they are still flexible enough to
be fine-tuned to change with developments in
student needs. The student store, the weekly
bulletin, and lectures notes have all been
covered in posters around campus. We think

some of the other ideas should be
emphasized.
The Herman slate has analyzed the recent
Student Senate Committee on Committees'
study of the process by which students are
nominated to University committees. While
supporting most of the reforms designed to
facilitate selection of student members, and
the establishment of a Committee Staff
Assistant position, the slate has, we think
wisely, rejected the proposal to move Senate
elections to the spring quarter.
They cite as disadvantages of the proposal
(1) disenfranchisement of the freshman class,
(2) confusion caused by the profusion of
candidates and campaign materials, and (3) as
an effect on the Nominations Committee,
excessive domination by and association with
the Council of Presidents.
New Recommendations
To compensate for the annual turnover in
student membership on most committees and
the need of most students for more
information about their committees and
student priorities, the Herman slate has made
the following recommendations: (1) the COP
will establish a file containing a conciseanalysis
of the major issues facing the University and
each committee; (2) from information
obtained from outgoing committee members,
Senators, task forces, and other student
groups the COP will publicize issues of
highest priorities to students; and (3) they

will prepare this information for committee
applicants.
In the area of undergraduate studies the
slate encourages inter-disciplinary general
education through expansion of a document
like The Stanford Compendium of Topical
Studies, and recognizes the importance of the
recent establishment by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies of ad hoc advisory
groups to review distribution requirements.
Investigation Proposed
As a long-range goal they propose
investigation of a residential college
operation. They also pledge active support of
SCIRE and SWOPSI to maintain the
maximum amount of opportunity for
individual initiative in education at Stanford.
Because of the intelligence and
thoroughness with which these proposals
have been prepared, because of the slate's
ability to work as a team, and because of the
members' collective record of dependability
and dedication in the Senate, on the Course
Review, on the Nominations Committee, and
on Committees on Undergraduate Studies
and Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid, we think they have earned the students'
support in the election Wednesday and
Thursday.
