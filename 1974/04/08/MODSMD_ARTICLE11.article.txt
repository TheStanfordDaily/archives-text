Message to President Lyman:
According to the April 3 Daily,
you do not understand "why the
union suspended negotiations."
Although our reasons were
explained to University
negotiators, they did not seem to
get the point, so your confusion is
perhaps understandable.
While you evidently feel USE
(United Stanford Employees) is
also being "unreasonable" in
negotiations, the representatives
of the union feel on the contrary
that the University is the
unreasonable party.
Some of my reasons for this
are indicated below. Both sides
might be criticized for postures
taken temporarily in the politics
and heat of negotiations, but it is
clear some real differences remain.
Under these circumstances, we
must return for instructions and a
show of strength from our
constituency. This procedure
takes time, like all democratic
processes, time which union
leaders must take in addition to
working hours and without pay,
unlike University negotiators, who
also have a smaller constituency.
Contract Vote Needed
We fully intend to return to
negotiations, but only after
gaining a vote from our
membership on the
minimally-acceptable contract,
since our original demands are
obviously not going to be met.
We also intend to finish
negotiations well before June,
because people in the unit have
been waiting for raises since
September and we quite frankly
have no faith in the spontaneous
goodwill of the University.
Regarding the issues of
negotiation, I have two major
comments. (Excuse me for using
the collective "you" in the
following for Stanford's
bargaining position.)
First, the University is
ridiculously paranoid. Restrictions
denying individuals (in or out of
the union even!) the right to
picket and outlawing "political"
notices on union bulletin boards

(what else is a union about?) are
absurd.
Publicly you call for trust, but
in negotiations you show no trust
in workers, calling always for
decisions "at the sole discretion of
the University." Trust might
come, but only if there is decent
accountability, access to
information and input in decisions
affecting the workers.
Unfair Position
Secondly, the University
position in money matters is
unfair. University policy
recognizes the need to keep the
endowment up with inflation, but

you have termed a union
cost-of-living escalator "not a
useful concept." Are the columns
of figures more important than
the workers?
We know your plan was to
balance the budget this year, but
we say you forgot something â€”
our wages. Workers need to keep
up with inflation as much as the
University, indeed more so, for
they do not have $700 million in
total assets.
This problem is particularly
acute for those on the bottom of
the pay scale,nows4l6 per month
before taxes. In 1969 a minimum
wage of $400 was set. Inflation

since then has been at least 25
percent, so that $500 represents
the same real wage as the 1969
"minimum wage." We are asking
$600. You staunchly claim $400
is still enough!
Could you support a family on
that kind of money? How much
are you paid to deny this money
to others? It is a sad comment on
this university that some Stanford
workers are eligible to receive
food stamps from the state of
California to supplement their low
salaries.
