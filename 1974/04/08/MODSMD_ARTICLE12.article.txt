# On ASSU Amendments

There will be three constitutional amendments
on the ballot this Wednesday and Thursday. The
one that will have the greatest impact on the ASSU
is the first.
This amendment would shift the election of the
Senate from the fall to the spring. It would also
shift the composition of the Nominations
Committee from three members elected in January
and April, to two members elected in January and
four elected in April by the new Senate.
Thus the Senate would elect a majority of the
members at that time. Both the Senate and the
Council of Presidents would be elected at the same
time and would therefore represent the same
constituency, and more critically, the same
viewpoint.
Also, the Nominations Committee would be
coordinated so that it would reflect the current
views of its constituency. Thus all three groups
would be elected in a space of two weeks.
Disagreement Diminished
It would save money by causing fewer elections
and would cut down on the fighting and mistiming
between the various groups. The Nominations
Committee is often split along old-new COP lines.
The Senate elected in the fall often represents no
concerted group, and thus the Council of Presidents
can more easily control it. This amendment offers a
chance to solve the problem.
In changing the election, the only problem is
that incoming freshmen will have to wait until
April to vote. Some think that this is

disenfranchisement. I simply ask how many
freshmen have the slightest idea of what or who
they are voting for when they go to the polls in the
third week of fall quarter? It would seem almost
better to have the freshmen wait and cast an
informed vote in the spring.
Amendment One will not necessarily cure the
constant division problems within the ASSU, but it
will at least make an effort to solve this persistent
split.
New Provisions
Amendment Two would create a way in which
to get rid of a Nominations Committee member
who was not doing his job. At present there is no
way of doing this. If a member never shows up
there is nothing that can be dorte, except hope that
he or she will resign.
Amendment Three would change the
presidential elections from the second and third
week of April to the third and fourth. It would also
allow constitutional amendments which are
submitted by petition to be put off an extra six
days if they are submitted at the end of one
quarter.
This change would be necessitated by the change
in the presidential election. If petitions were
submitted at the end of winter quarter a special
election would have to be held in the second week
of spring, just before the proposed presidential
election would be held.
