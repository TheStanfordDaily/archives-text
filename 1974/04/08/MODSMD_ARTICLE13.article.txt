Over the past few years, black
students have made a number of
appeals to administrators on
college campuses. These appeals
cover a diverse spectrum of areas.
These demands reflect a growing
awareness on the part of black
people.
This social consciousness
clearly points to the inability of
institutions of higher learning to
fulfill their commitments as
expressed during the period of
rebellion that followed the
assassination of the late Reverend
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Stanford University is one
among a long list of institutions
that felt it necessary to revaluate
its existing relations with minority
communities.
Among the demands submitted
by black students were 1) an
increase in the number of black
students to a minimum level that
reflects the national percentage of
black people in the United States,
2) an increase in the number of
black faculty, staff and
administrators, and 3) relief for
the psychological frustrations and
social isolation that black students
face in the residence system. The
latter point provided the impetus
for the Black Student Cultural
Center proposal.
Roble Failed
It is of paramount importance
that a theme house accurately
reflect the black experience. The
so-called "Roble Theme House"
has failed to meet the needs of
black students. As a result, we
submitted a proposal for the
establishment of a Black Student
Cultural Center.
The proposal was designed
specifically to meet those needs
and to alleviate the present
problems characteristic of Roble.
The Black Theme House is no
more than a concentration of
black students living in conflict
with a 70 percent white majority.
It is filled with white students
who have little or no interest in
black culture and were merely
placed there by the housing draw.
Our suggested alternative
would alleviate the problems
inherent in Roble in that
uninterested students would not
be compelled or forced to live in
such facilities. This alternative
called for an independent
four-class house of approximately
60 students (which is
approximately 10 percent of the
black population at Stanford)
with independent food service,
space for cultural displays, and
accommodations for large
meetings or small conferences.
Accurate Reflection
These requirements, in
conjunction with other house
programs, would accurately
reflect the black experience.
This proposal, rejected by the
University on the grounds of
probable defacto segregation and
the policy of not "Balkanizing"
the Stanford residence system,
caused black students to seek yet
another alternative.
Terra House, one of five in the
Cowell cluster, as well as one
Wilbur house as an v extension of
the Cultural Center, was the
suggested alternative. The Wilbur
house was necessary due to the
University's policy that freshmen
must reside in a facility associated
with a residence staff. This second
alternative was rejected on the
same grounds as was the first.
New Cultural Center
Olivo-Magnolia, a part of
Lagunita Court, has been
designated by the University as
the Black Student Cultural Center
for 1974-75. This arrangement
was not totally acceptable to
black students, but becuase of the
University's manner in presenting
this arrangement, black students
had no other alternative.
The University gave the option
of either accepting Olivo-Magnolia
with 50 percent of the spaces
reserved for black students, and
the faculty resident that the
University appointed, or accepting
the complete elimination of a
black residential program here at
Stanford.
Black students reluctantly
accepted this arrangement
primarily because of the concern
for the fate of incoming black
freshmen, of upper classmen faced
with the proposition of moving
off campus, and the ultimate
future of black programs at
Stanford. It must be understood
that this arrangement was
accepted because no other
acceptable arrangement was
offered by the University.
Many black students are still
very much dissatisfied with the
situation at Stanford. The
University should have a greater
commitment to the concerns set
forth by black students during the
period of rebellion following the
assassination of the late Reverend
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
