## Students Examine Contraceptive Use 
### DENIS CUFF 
The movement for equality
between the sexes is emerging in
discussion of contraceptives.
A student task force in a
winter quarter human biology
class, "Biosocial Aspects of Birth
Control," examined ways to
rreate "an equal responsibility
v:onsciousness" for contraceptive
use.
The group of seven students
urged changes to make better use
of existing contraceptive methods
and to aid development of new
ones.
Most notably, they favored
development of a male oral
contraceptive or "pill."
Women should have more say
in the decision whether they or
their partners use contraceptives,
asserted group member Betsy
Shelton. She said part of the
Problem stems from the situation
that not enough male
contraceptive methods exist. She
added that male contraceptive use
involves an "all or nothing
decision": men either have to use
condoms or have vasectomies.
For practical purposes, you
an't consider vasectomies
reversible, Shelton explained.
Approximately three-fourths of
reversible vasectomy operations
are unsuccessful, she said. Besides,
she added, the cost and several
days involved in such an operation
makes it prohibitive.
On the other hand, condoms
are not effective enough, Shelton
said. She explained the condom's
failure in preventing pregnancies is
largely due to misuse. But, she
asserted, it's hard to expect
people, especially inexperienced
teenagers, to more effectively use
the condom when they're dealing
with the psychological and social
pressures of the sexual act.
Reduce Pressure
Shelton said that if an effective
male "pill" existed, it would
reduce pressure on women to
issume full contraceptive
responsibilities.
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi,
who first synthesized the
compound for the female pill, has
estimated it would take several
million dollars and 12 to 20 years
to develop a pill for males. He also
said that unless changes occur in
the status of research in this area,
it could take much longer.
Recognizing this problem, task
force member Marlene Durand
examined the factors contributing
to the failure of researchers to
develop a male pill comparable to

the female one.
Durand pointed out basic
knowledge of the woman's
reproductive system is greater
than that of the man's. Part of
this situation results from the
historical demand for
contraceptives coming chiefly
from women.
She explained that there are far
more links (14) in the female
reproductive system than in the
male system (4). This number of
links gives researchers more "areas
of attack" in the female than in
the male.
'All Or Nothing'
Durand also pointed out the
need for an "all or nothing" effect
of any chemical contraceptive
agent for males. Its effect must be
complete on the number of sperm
cells (millions) in each ejaculation.
Even low-count sperm ejaculates
can produce pregnancies, she said.
Moreover, Durand added, the
effect on individual cells must be
complete. A partially affected cell
could produce genetically
damaged sperm that could
produce mutant babies, she
explained. "This would be
disastrous."
Another problem in research,
she continued, is collecting
evidence to test the effectiveness
of a male pill. "Mating samples are
required as well as ejaculatory
samples," she explained.
Although the decreasing social
stigma about masturbation has
made it easier to collect
ejaculatory samples, she said,
there still remains the problem of
getting a sufficient number of
couples for mating samples.
None of these problems are
insurmountable to more research,
Durand contended. She said that
if enough interest and financial
backing existed, couples could be
paid to participate.
Djerassi Disagrees
Djerassi, however, disagreed
with the group's estimation of the
economic feasibility of developing
such an agent.
You have to convince the
pharmaceutical companies that if
they spend millions of dollars and
years on research, it's going to pay
off for them, he said. They're the
ones who largely bear the cost of
research for new drugs, he said.
Higher costs of research and
stricter Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulations
make it increasingly difficult for
pharmaceutical companies to
develop any chemical
contraceptives, he said. There's

not enough research being done
into male or female
contraceptives, he added.
Several members of the group
think a "large demand" for a male
pill presently exists and that it
will continue to grow.
More Vasectomies
Shelton pointed to the
increasing number of vasectomies
being performed today. She said
officials at the San Mateo Planned
Parenthood Center told her even
teenagers are indicating interest in
vasectomies for when they get
older. Even though vasectomies
mainly concern men over 35,
Shelton said the increased interest
is an example of men's changing
attitudes toward sharing
contraceptives.
Shelton also cited the group's
survey of 150 Stanford males in
which 80 percent said they
thought there should be more
research into male contraceptives.
This number dropped when the
survey asked if they'd consider
using a male pill with side effects
comparable to those of the female
pill.
However, it rose back to 80
percent again when the survey
question asked if the males would
consider using such a pill if their
partner couldn't use the pill or
intra uterine device.
Shelton stressed that this
survey shouldn't be "heavily
credited" when looking at the
nation as a whole. But, she
claimed, the survey can't be
dismissed when considered in light
of changing societal values.
New Demand
She said that increasing
numbers of couples seeking
egalitarian relationships will help
create a demand for a male pill.
She added that the women's
liberation and zero population
growth movements contribute to
a new awareness about
contraceptive responsibility.
Shelton said there should be a
new contraceptive agent "whether
or not 95 percent of the men in
the country use it." Certain FDA
restrictions should be relaxed and
companies should be subsidized
for research on contraceptives, she
said.
Djerassi has urged these
changes for several years. In 1970,
he wrote that during the long
period a new contraceptive agent
is tested for toxicity, it would be
"only reasonable that the public
[taxpayers] should bear part of
its development cost."
In the same article, Djerassi

criticized the FDA because its role
in contraceptive research "seems
to have moved from that of
protector to that of the
guarantor... No drug can be
totally effective and completely
safe, and no agency of
government can guarantee that it
will be."
Changing Regulations
Djerassi said that pressure for
changing FDA regulations should
not come chiefly from FDA
officials, but from the press and
"informed citizens." He cited the
"irresponsible" coverage of the
pill. He charged a
"sensationalistic" press
overplayed the positive effects of
the pill when it was first
developed and later overplayed its
negative side effects.
If you didn't know about a
new drug and someone told you it
sometimes had the side effects of
nausea and internal bleeding, and
overuse could cause death, you
probably wouldn't buy it, Djerassi
said. "Yet those are side effects of
aspirin."
People are going to have to
face the fact that chemical
contraceptives have side effects,
he added.
The task force also examined
legal aspects of increasing equal
responsibility consciousness. They
suggested that if the legal
responsibilities of unwed fathers
were better known, men might be
more concerned with
contraceptives.
Stanford Survey
In their survey of Stanford
students, they fould that the
majority of both men and women
questioned had a poor idea of
what these laws are, if any idea at
all.
According to Mike Reynard,
the California law states that if a
man is identified as a child's
father, he is "criminally liable" to
pay support until the child is 21
years old.
However, Reynard said, unwed
mothers may not have the
knowledge, money or motivation
to bring suit against the father.
Once the matter gets to court,
there still exists the problem of
identifying the father, he said.
The only widely used
identification test, a blood test,
can tell who the father is not, but
not who he is, Reynard explained.
He said that Associate Law Prof.
Michael Wald told him that
sometimes lawyers will hold up a
baby before the jury and ask,
"Doesn't this look like the child's

father?"
Reynard said that for practical
reasons legislation concerning sex
education or contraception
distribution should be associated
with venereal disease prevention.
That's the only way to get
legislation passed, he said.
He cited Governor Reagan's
opposition to many sex education
proposals, and his veto of a bill to
legalize the sale of condoms in
vending machines fa law already
passed in Colorado and Oregon].
Reagan opposed these measures
on the grounds they contribute to
promiscuity, Reynard said.
Development of better
condoms is an area where the U.S.
trails other countries, most
notably Japan, Reynard said.
Thinner condoms have played a
major part in Japan's birth control
programs, he explained.
Finally, the group contended
that change in social and
economic conditions will
contribute to new awareness
about contraceptives.
"If more employment is
opened up to women, less often
will some women have children
out of a lack of alternatives,"
Reynard said.
Shelton claimed that if more
men shared responsibility for
child care, it would increase their
awareness about contraceptives
and the full-time responsibility
which child rearing requires.
