# 'Save OEO' Organizes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
diverse band of supporters has
formed to try to save the
controversial government child,
the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO), from death
at age 10.
President Nixon left OEO out
of his new federal budget, which
means an end to the office as such
by June 30, unless Congress does
something about it.
The administration wants to
dismantle the agency and transfer
its work to other existing agencies
and departments.
The lineup for keeping OEO
includes the Congressional Black
Caucus, Alabama Gov. George
Wallace, Republican Mayor
Richard Lugar of Indianapolis,
Democratic Mayor Richard Daley
of Chicago, and some 35
governors.
Basically, House supporters of
OEO are working to extend the
agency and its programs for
another three years at their 1972
spending total of $1.4 billion.
Funded would be the OEO's
Community Action Program
(CAP) which includes Head Start
for pre-schoolers, Follow Through
for elementary school children,
and a range of other programs
from day care to services for the
aged in rural as well as urban
areas.
There are some 900 CAP
programs across the country
which employ 185,000 persons, a
good number of them ex-welfare
recipients.
