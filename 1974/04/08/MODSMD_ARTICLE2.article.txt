# Youth Development Center To Provide interdepartmental Research Approach
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The Boys Town Center for Youth
Development will provide a more
inter-departmental approach to
practical research on deprived and
disturbed children, according to
Emeritus Psychology Prof. Robert
Sears, acting director of the project.
Since forms and effects of
deprivation are complex, the center
will include faculty from several
departments, including psychology,
education, sociology, law, economics,
and medicine, Sears said.
"Research related to a number of
these concerns is already in progress,"
he explained. "Many of the various
research projects exist in at least
partial isolation from each other,
because of natural departmental and
school boundaries.
"The development of somewhat
more integrated research efforts by
faculty members of great individual
distinction makes the Center, bringing
together many of these efforts, an
exciting prospect," he said.
Director A Psychologist
Sears said that the first full-time
director, to be appointed within a few

months, will be a psychologist hired
from outside the University.
In order to maintain an open flow
of ideas, the center will draw its
faculty from professors with
continuing appointments in related
fields. Similarly, students working in
the center will be those admitted
through existing departments. Faculty
appointments to the project will be no
more than half-time, except for the
program director.
Sears indicated that he expects a
number of new course offerings to
grow from the project. The center will
also be expected to provide internship
opportunities for students who want
professional training in working with
disadvantaged children.
Another Project
Boys Town is funding another new
research institution at the Catholic
University of America in Washington,
D.C. These two projects will maintain
close contact with the center at Boys
Town in Omaha, Neb.
Since the facilities will be working
with Boys Town in Nebraska, Stanford
faculty and students will have
opportunities to participate in

conferences, internship programs, and
possibly research practicums there.
Currently, about 200
undergraduates are involved in various
paraprofessional programs working
with problem children. The new
research center will be specifically
designed to study child development,
and will provide these children with
more guidance and encouragement,
according to the project proposal.
Boys Town will provide $450,000
annually for operating costs for the
next 25 years.
Center In Quad
The center will probably be located
in the Quad, in what is now the
physiology building. The building will
be renovated with an additional $1.5
million grant.
The center will not be involved in
actual treatment, but will concentrate
on research.
Father Robert P. Hupp, executive
director of Boys Town, said, "It is our
hope that research will produce results
which can be applied not only to our
own programs at Boys Town, but
which will be available nationally to
youth workers."

program director.
Sears indicated that he expects a
number of new course offerings to
grow from the project. The center will
also be expected to provide internship
opportunities for students who want
professional training in working with
disadvantaged children.
Another Project
Boys Town is funding another new
research institution at the Catholic
University of America in Washington,
D.C. These two projects will maintain
close contact with the center at Boys
Town in Omaha, Neb.
Since the facilities will be working
with Boys Town in Nebraska, Stanford
faculty and students will have
opportunities to participate in

conferences, internship programs, and
possibly research practicums there.
Currently, about 200
undergraduates are involved in various
paraprofessional programs working
with problem children. The new
research center will be specifically
designed to study child development,
and will provide these children with
more guidance and encouragement,
according to the project proposal.
Boys Town will provide $450,000
annually for operating costs for the
next 25 years.
Center In Quad
The center will probably be located
in the Quad, in what is now the
physiology building. The building will
be renovated with an additional $1.5
million grant.
The center will not be involved in
actual treatment, but will concentrate
on research.
Father Robert P. Hupp, executive
director of Boys Town, said, "It is our
hope that research will produce results
which can be applied not only to our
own programs at Boys Town, but
which will be available nationally to
youth workers."
The Boys Town Center for Youth
Development will provide a more
inter-departmental approach to
practical research on deprived and
disturbed children, according to
Emeritus Psychology Prof. Robert
Sears, acting director of the project.
Since forms and effects of
deprivation are complex, the center
will include faculty from several
departments, including psychology,
education, sociology, law, economics,
and medicine, Sears said.
"Research related to a number of
these concerns is already in progress,"
he explained. "Many of the various
research projects exist in at least
partial isolation from each other,
because of natural departmental and
school boundaries.
"The development of somewhat
more integrated research efforts by
faculty members of great individual
distinction makes the Center, bringing
together many of these efforts, an
exciting prospect," he said.
Director A Psychologist
Sears said that the first full-time
director, to be appointed within a few

months, will be a psychologist hired
from outside the University.
In order to maintain an open flow
of ideas, the center will draw its
faculty from professors with
continuing appointments in related
fields. Similarly, students working in
the center will be those admitted
through existing departments. Faculty
appointments to the project will be no
more than half-time, except for the
program director.

also be expected to provide internship
opportunities for students who want
