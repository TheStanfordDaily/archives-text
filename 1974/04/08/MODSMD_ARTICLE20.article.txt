# Hugh Sloan Watergate Source

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Two
Washington Post reporters who
pieced together major Watergate
stories say that Hugh W. Sloan Jr.,
one time treasurer of President
Nixon's re-election committee,
was a major source of information
for them.
Sloan's role and that of a
highly placed administration
source, whom the reporters call
"Deep Throat," are described by
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward
in their forthcoming book, All the
President's Men. Excerpts appear
in the May and June issues of
Playboy magazine.
The Washington Post won a
Pulitzer prize in 1973 for its
investigation of Watergate, almost
all of which was done by
Bernstein and Woodward.
Many of the Post's stories were
developed by perserving on leads
by-passed by government
investigators and other newsmen,

the articles say, but crucial
confirmation often came from a
handful of sources including
Sloan.
In a parenthetical aside, the
authors note that Slaon was never
identified as a source in Post
stories, but that he has now
agreed to allow the disclosure of
his name. Sloan declined on
Sunday to comment on the
Playboy excerpts, although he had
read the article.
The book will be published by
Simon & Schuster on June 18. A
spokeswoman for Playboy said
the magazine paid $30,000 for the
right to excerpt 25,000 words, or
about a quarter of the total.
It was from Sloan, former
treasurer of the Finance
Committee to Re-elect the
President, that Woodward and
Bernstein said they first learned
the names of several key
controllers of a secret GOP fund
for financing campaign activities
against the Democrats.
Summing up the Watergate
affair, "Deep Throat" was quoted
by Bernstein and Woodward as
saying it began in 1969 with "the
first targets of aggressive
wiretapping .. . the reporters and
those in the administration who
were suspected of disloyalty.
