# Industries Cut Back Investment
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Many U.S. industries have cut
back their 1974 investment plans
because of the energy shortage,
although the total investment
outlook remains about the same,
the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
The department said a big 7.3
percent increase in investment in
the petroleum industry nearly
offset declines in most other
industries.
Total 1974 investment by all
industry is estimated at $112.7
billion, only $60 million less than
was planned before the energy
shortage became serious,
in a Commerce Department survey

The survey appeared to show
some concern, but no great alarm,
on the part of business over the
long-range effect of the shortage
on the economy.
About 20 percent of the firms
said they had changed their
spending plans, the department
said.
Most of these had cut back on
their investments, led by the
airlines industry where spending
was down 3 percent, or $60
million, from earlier plans.
Other declines were in
the primary metals industry, where
the spending outlook was down
seven-tenths of 1 percent and in
motor vehicles, where spending
plans were off 1.2 percent and by
commercial firms, by 1.7 percent.
On the plus side, the spending
outlook by the petroleum
industry was up 7.3 percent, or
$520 million, to a total $7.2
billion in 1974 investment.
Also increasing were railroad
investment and steel investment.
