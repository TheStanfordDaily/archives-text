# Cards Take Two Of Three From USC
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Historical Note: The last time Stanford's baseball team
won the Pacific Eight Conference championship was in
1967, when the Indians went all the way to the NCAA
championships, the College World Series in Omaha,
Nebraska.
Since then. University of Southern California has
dominated the Pac-8 and the renamed Cardinals. For some
reason the rivalry between the two schools has been vicious
and closely contested. Last weekend's series was no
different.
However, it has always been USC on top. USC winning
the football game (in the last three seconds this year), USC
winning the basketball game (three points in the final
minute) and USC taking the baseball championships (the
last four straight). Saturday there was an exception, the
winner was not USC, it was Stanford.
The Cardinals opened the Pac-8 schedule Friday by
upsetting USC in a come from behind 3-2 victory,
highlighted by Bob Hampton's dramatic three-run homer in
the ninth inning.
Then the Cardinals took the series by winning the
nightcap of Saturday's doubleheader 6-5 after losing the
controversial first game 7-5. (See accompanying story
below.)
Typical Series
"I think it's very typical of every series we've played
against USC," said Stanford head coach Ray Young. "Every
game is usually decided by one or two runs. Every year the
conference is a battle between us and them. We're about
the only team in the conference that can compete with
them."
Before the series began, USC had taken three games
from Cal, who Stanford plays in a non-conference game
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. in Sunken Diamond. The USC
record for the year was an impressive 22-3 compared to
Stanford's inconsistent 10-15. But now Stanford's
challenging Troy's domination, with a 2-1 league mark. The
Trojans are 4-2.
Trojan Coach Rod Dedeaux packed up his squad with a
frown and marched his club out of the park late Saturday
afternoon after what can be termed by USC fans as the
biggest baseball embarrassment they've suffered in the past
few years.
Last Game
"I thought the kids battled real well," said Young after
the final game. "[John] Yandle just did an outstanding job
pitching."
The third game of the series was pitched by a pair from
Lake Oswego, Ore., junior righthander A 1 Arthur and
freshman lefthander Yandle, facing against his second
national power in a week. At Riverside last week, Yandle
got the win in Stanford's 12-10 victory over Arizona State,
ranked fifth in the country. Saturday Yandle added
third-ranked USC to his belt to even his record at 2-2.
Yandle's stint, was a clutch performance that had
everyone in the park pinching themselves wondering
whether what they were witnessing was true, an
inexperienced freshman, barely out of swaddling clothes
was setting down the mighty awesome Trojans, four-time
national champs.
"Yandle had all the guts of a cat burglar," said Card
pitching coach Tom Dunton. If you've heard that phrase
before, you won't be too far wrong if you say that's the
way Dick Williams, then the manager of the Oakland A's,
described Jim (Catfish) Hunter's victory over the New York
Mets last October.

That's mighty high company Dunton is placing his
freshman pitcher in. Oh, well it's not too often that you
beat Arizona State and USC in successive outings.
Pitching Switch
After Arthur, 1-5 for the season, became ineffective in
the fourtn inning, giving up two runs, Dunton decided to go
to Yandle with the bases loaded and one out. The
phenomenal youngster got the second out on a ground ball
back to him which he threw home for a force. Then he
struck out the designated hitter on a called third strike,
snuffing out the Trojan rally.
In all, Yandle allowed two runs on a double by Anthony
Davis, and a triple by Creighton Tevlin in the sixth inning
and a single run in the eighth on a single by Denny
Martindale, a double by Tom Bhagwat and a sacrifice fly by
Davis.
However, the Davis double in the sixth is very
questionable. It was a ground ball down the third base line
that could have been picked up by the third base coach in
foul territory. Instead, umpire Roy Roth called the ball fair
as Davis looked back while running to first base, a sort of
begging look to see if the ball was called fair.
The Stanford coaches were upset at the call, storming the
umpire immediately. It was like many of the crucial
decisions that this tremendous rivalry naturally breeds.
Stanford catcher Dave Baker threw his mask against the
wall nearly catching two or three spectators in the stands in
disgust.
Top-Notch Pitching
Other than that miscue, Yandle pitched magnificently
retiring the side in order in the fifth, seventh and ninth
innings. The final out of the game was a called third strike,
an appropriate finish to an outstanding series and, of
course, it added to the sting of defeat for USC.
Stanford jumped out in front early in that third game
with Mark Lucich sparking the attack. The senior first
baseman smashed a monumental 420-foot drive to dead
center field to lead off the second inning.
The Cards added another run when Bob Hampton scored
on a sacrifice fly by Gary Pitchford, another freshman who
played designated hitter. Pitchford has hit a home run, two
doubles and batted in six runs in his brief varsity experience
which began two weeks ago.
The Cards tallied four more times in the third on four
successive singles off of starter John Racanelli, a native of
Palo Alto, knocking him out of the box. Singles by Kevin
Sullivan, Joe Lamoure, Bruce Robinson, Baker and a walk
to Lucich, set the stage for a two-run double by Steve
Davis, who along with "Bake," collected two hits in the
game.
Opening Loss
In Saturday's first game, USC jumped on Stanford
starting pitcher Mike Williamson for three runs in the first
inning. The Trojans loaded the bases and scored two runs
before an out was recorded.
Creighton Tevlin opened the game with a bloop single to
right field, Kemp was hit in the right leg, and Rich Dauer,
USC's top hitter who came into the series batting .455 but
went out hitting considerably less, lined a single to left field
filling the sacks. Ken Huizenga's line drive to right field
drove in two runs and a deep fly ball by Cobb to centerfield
chased home the third run.
Gary Bei scored Stanford's first run in the bottom of the
first by walking, advancing to third on a bunt and scoring
on a ground ball by Baker. Then came the controversial
double by Lucich which held up the game for
approximately 10 minutes while coaches from both sides

pleaded their cases to no avail.
USC opened up a 7-1 lead by scoring single runs in the
second, third, fourth and fifth innings, Huizenga added his
third RBI of the game in the third inning by clobbering a
Williamson fastball 360 feet to dead left, almost clearing
the old green fence which is no longer used.
Stanford closed the margin in the fifth by scoring two
runs and came two more on a two-run homer by Hampton,
his second of the series, but could not catch the Trojans.
Friday's Thriller
Friday's game had all the makings of a Stanley Kubrick
film or a Sherlock Holmes mystery. The unexpected
happened at the end when Hampton socked an exciting
three-run homer to win the game.
That comeback ninth began when Mark Lucich singled,
advanced to second on a ground ball by Steve Davis to
shortstop Marvin Cobb, who flipped to second baseman
Rob Adolph for an apparent force out. However, Adolph,
who hadn't made a play all day, dropped the ball. Hampton
hit the next pitch out of the park in left field.
"I was just keyed to hit," said Hampton, who ripped a
waist high fast ball that was turned over by pitcher Rus
McQueen, USC's ace, fresh from throwing a no-hitter
against Cal the Saturday before.
"I've been swinging the bat erratically," said Hampton.
"But McQueen didn't pitch too intelligently to me."
Hampton had almost parked one in the fourth inning but it
was caught at the fence in center field.
Dave Frost pitched eight fine innings for the Cards, but
Bernie Hittner received credit for the win.
USC's Runs
USC scored both runs in the third inning when after
Tevlin singled, Kemp hit a sinking liner to left field which
was misjudged by Kevin Sullivan and dropped in for a
double, scoring Tevlin. Dauer drove in Kemp with a single.
"Frost had the best command of hisoffspeed curve ball
this season," said Dunton. "His bad back still restricts him
somewhat."
Dedeaux wasn't pleased with his team's performance
Friday, saying that "it was one of those things when we
dropped that damn ball at second. That double play
[turned over by BeiJ killed us in the ninth."
Young summed up his team's attitude which
characterized the play of the Cards, "the win Friday took
away the immortality of the Trojans. It showed that we
could do more than just stand around looking at them in
awe."

COACH DEDEAUX


SLIDE FOR THIRD — Gary Bei slides into third on a bunt in the first inning of Saturday's first game of a doubleheader
between Stanford and USC at Sunken Diamond. Bei was stealing on the pitch and kept on going when third baseman Rich
Dauer (24) threw to first after fielding Bruce Robinson's bunt. The third base coach is Mark Marquess, shortstop Marvin
Cobb waits for the throw and catcher Ed Putman hustles over to cover the bag . ..

... AND THEN — Bei collided with Dauer on the tag knocking both players unconscious for a few moments. Both
remained in the game. Bei eventually scored on Dave Baker's ground ball to shortstop. USC won the game 7-5 but lost the
nightcap 6-5 to give the Cards two wins in the three game series.
