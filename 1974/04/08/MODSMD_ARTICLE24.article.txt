# Fun, Sun, Beer, Catcalls
## Doubleheader Becomes Great Picnic 
### ALEX HULANICKI 
Saturday afternoon's doubleheader against USC
had all the makings of a great picnic — there was
plenty of sun, plenty of beer and plenty of people,
about 2100. There was so much diversity that it can
be assumed that one of the aims of Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon, to bring individuals to
the campus, was fulfilled.
It was a great afternoon of bench jockeying,
name calling and generally getting drunk. And, it
sounded as if the participants — the fans, players,
coaches and umpires — were going to sit down and
play a long game of "Hate Your Neighbor."
All this happened in Sunken Diamond, the stage
for many close, hotly contested games that have
ended in one- or two-run decisions or even in the
stalemate — a 3-3 tie called because of darkness in
1967, for example. That game ended in argument,
and rhubarbs and brouhahas have characterized many
of the others. Saturday's first game found
Stanford's coaches a little on the hot side.
Controversial Play
After USC, that institute of higher learning that
has produced top government leaders, such as John
Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, had jumped out
to a 3-0 lead. Stanford came back to score one run
and apparently had it cut to one on an inside-the
park home run by Mark Lucich that was taken away
by home plate umpire Ernie Golding.
The chronological order of the controversial
ruling is very much in doubt to this moment. But
here goes one version:
Lucich slashed the 2 0 pitch down the left field
line. Left fielder Creighton Tevlin, having trouble

judging the fly ball, leaped for it right on the chalk
mark, touching it, making the drive fair, according
to the umpire. Then Tevlin fell over the short fence
to the bullpen, with the ball caroming off his glove
to the top of the fence and back into play.
Live Ball?
Technically the ball was still "live" and
accordingly Lucich sprinted around the bases. While
Lucich was circling, shortstop Marvin Cobb ran out
to left field and retrieved the ball but no one
noticed where he picked the ball up — either out of
play (over the fence, after Tevlin flipped to Cobb)
or from next to the fence.
The umpire's view saw the play as a ground rule
double. The base umpire didn't see it, so Golding
made the ruling, calling "two bases" immediately.
So Dedeaux rushed out to protest, claiming that
the ball was actually foul. A five-minute
conversation, to put it mildly, followed. However,
the umpire stood firm. It was two bases.
Another Protest
If you think the umpire was going to get off
easy, you're wrong. As soon as Dedeaux had
finished dressing down the men in blue, Young and
assistants Mark Marquess and Tom Dunton, were
out on the field explaining their side of the play to
the umpires, claiming a home run.
They said the ball was never out of play, so a
ground rule double could not have been called.
What it all boils down to is that the play is a
judgment ruling so the game could not be played
under protest. Both teams had to accept the
umpire's decision.
"I think the umpires don't really know what

happened," said Young. "They couldn't go back
afterwards to change their ruling. He [Golding] put
a time limit on us so he would have booted us out
of there."
Bench Jockeys
From the beginning the USC bench occupied
their time "jockeying" — trying to intimidate the
opposition with insults — the Cards. Their prime
targets were pitcher Mike Williamson, catcher Dave
Baker and Friday's hero, Bob Hampton among
others.
The Stanford students in the stands also got into
the act, hurling insults at the Trojans, particularly,
second baseman Rob Adolph, and the umpires.
Some examples of the barrage directed toward
Adolph were:
"You're a great guy, nine." Then, someone else
half-heartedly stuck up for Adolph, the back-up
quarterback for Pat Haden, with, "Coach, they're
yelling at me."
The stellar second baseman, who played against
Stanford as though he couldn't play back-up to
anyone in the nation, promptly popped up a bunt,
which elicited calls from other Card rooters,
"you've set the game back 20 years," and "are you
the designated fielder?".
One of the taunts hurled by USC's bench at
Baker was "what are you doing looking in our
dugout, looking for your girlfriend? The umpires
warned USC's bench twice to stop name-calling.
The umpires, as always, were the bullseyes of the
fans. Two half-inebriated scholars said, "if you had
one eye, you'd be a cyclops, blue," and "whose
roommate were you, Haldeman's or Ehrlichman's?"
