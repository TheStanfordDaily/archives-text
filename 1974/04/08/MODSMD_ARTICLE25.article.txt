# Card Netmen Split Los Angeles Duals
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
There were no heroes, there
were no goats.
Every one of the seven
Stanford tennis players who went
down to Los Angeles to play in
the team's 5-4 loss to UCLA
Friday and 5-4 win over USC
Saturday won a match. Every one
of the seven lost at least once.
And after it was over, coach
Dick Gould could still laugh "I
guess we gave you something to
write about for our matches
against them up here."
And he could also reflect, "we
have to be a lot better than we
are. As a team, we learned a lot
about ourselves."
There are five pretty good
reasons why UCLA was able to
beat Stanford before what Gould
called a "brutal" Westwood
crowd.
At first singles, defending
NCAA champion Sandy Mayer,
supposedly fresh from a successful
USLTA winter tour, didn't seem
to be ready for outdoor tennis.
UCLA's star sophomore, Brian
Teacher, used an overpowering
serve to beat Mayer 6-3, 6-2.
At third singles, John
Whitlinger lost to Steve Mott, 6-4,
6-4. Gould didn't mince words in
describing Whit's play. "Johnny
couldn't get his first serve in and
Mott was killing the returns. He
played scared Friday."
DuPre Illness
Pat DuPre, playing fourth
singles, actually was playing well,
but DuPre, who has had the flu,
completely gave out in the 85
degree heat and lost to Tom
Kreiss, 7-6, 4-6, 6-2.
DuPre was unable to play
doubles, forcing Gould to team
Whitlinger with Nick Saviano.
"Sav" took the backhand court,
so Whitlinger moved to the
forehand court, an
unaccustomed placing for him,
and the makeshift team lost to
Kreiss-Ferdi Taygan, who were
playing Australian style (two men
on one side) 3-6, 7-6, 6-4.
The other loss against the
Bruins was by Saviano sixth
singles. A freshman, Saviano was
playing under a lot of pressure,
and the crowd, fierce after some
disputed calls, added to this
pressure. He lost to Dave Parker,
3-6, 7-5, 6-4.
Stanford's four wins included a
nice win by Jim Delaney at
second singles over Taygan, 6-2,
6-1, and a tough 6-7, 6-4, 6-2 win
by Chico Hagey over Spencer
Segura.
Mayer-Delaney, playing as a
team for the first time since
June's NCAA's, beat
Mott-Teacher 6-2, 6-1. "Jim's
playing much better doubles than
he has before," Gould said.
Hagey-Fisher, at third doubles,
beat Jim Landes-Horace Reid, 7-5,
6-7, 7-5. Gould was disappointed
by the closeness of this match. "It
should never be that close against
a team like that," he said, though
complimenting the play of the
Stanford entrants.
USC Closeness
Theoretically, the closest a
college win can be is a 5-4 match
win, won 5-4 in a third-set
tiebreaker. And that's what
happened Saturday against USC.
With all other matches
finished, Mayer-Delaney were
locked in a three- setter with SC
stars John Andrews-Sashi Menon.
It went to 4-4 in the
tiebreaker, Andrews serving.
Literally, it was a one point
match. After a long rally, Delaney
hit one off the wood that his foes
couldn't return, winning the
match in very sudden-death.
The other eight matches

generally went the exact opposite
way they went Friday, from
Stanford's point of view. Mayer
rebounded from Friday's loss with
a 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 win over perennial
foe Andrews, who beat Mayer
once last year.
Delaney Excellent
However, Delaney couldn't
quite handle India's Menon,
playing second singles. Menon,
who Gould says is capable of
beating anyone on a given day,
topped Delaney ?-3, 6-4.
Still, Gould complimented the
Stanford star's play, saying "I was
very pleased with Jimmy both
days. He has less fundamental
weaknesses than he had last year
and is on the way to becoming a
competitive tournament player."
Whitlinger rebounded from his
defeat to top John Holladay 7-6,
3-6, 7-5. "He played with more
confidence Saturday," the coach
said. With DuPre held back
because of his physical condition,
Hagey moved into the fourth
position and lost to England's
Mike Weyman, 6-4, 6-3. "Chico
did not play well in either singles
match," Gould said. "I know he
can play much better."
Saviano, playing fifth against
Butch Walts, with whom he split
four matches last year, topped
Walts 5-7, 7-5, 6-2, playing well
and taking advantage of the illness
of his opponent in the final set.
Foreigner's Triumph
At the final singles slot, Chip
Fisher, the only player available
to Gould, lost to Chile's Hans
Gildermeister 3-6, 7-6, 6-4. Thus,
all three of USC's foreign players
won, while their domestic entries
didn't fare so well.
At second doubles, DuPre
returned from his rest to team
with Whit to beat Holladay-Walts
4-6, 6-2, 6-4. Back at third
doubles, Hagey-Fisher lost to
Gildermister-Wayman, 1-6, 6-2,
6-1.

TENNIS TALK: Thisll be a
big week for Stanford's team.
Thursday, the Cards play
vastly-improved Cal at Berkeley.
The Bears lost to UCLA by only
one more match than the Cards,
bowing 6-3.
That match is sandwiched
between two non-conference
tests. Tomorrow, U. of San Diego
comes to Stanford, while
Saturday, Southern Methodist,
fourth in the nation this year, will
be the Cardinals' foes. For this
match, Stanford will play its top
lineup.

MIRACLE MlLER—Stanford's Tony Sandoval ran the mile in Drake
Stadium at UCLA, which is just off Los Angeles' Miracle mile. He was
one of the few Stanford bright spots in Saturday's loss to (JSC.
Sandoval ran a 4:11.5 to finish second.
