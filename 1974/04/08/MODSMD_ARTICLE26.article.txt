# Crew Team Captures Con Findlay Cup
## 
### 
Stanford's crew teams,winning
the freshman and junior varsity
races and finishing second in the
varsity event, recaptured the Con
Findlay cup from Oregon State
Saturday.
Lightning-fast conditions
prevailed at the Port of Redwood
City for the varsity event, won by
OSU in a time of 5:32, with
Stanford just five seconds behind
in second place. USC and Santa
Clara finished third and fourth.
According to captain Dave
Glossbrenner, the fast conditions,
which included a favorable
current and tailwind, hurt the
Cardinal boat. "We race at a lower
stroke than OSU. In a short race,
they don't have to have that much
endurance. We were closing at the
finish and if we had another 40
seconds, which we would have

had in a normal race, we might
have won it."
However, Glossbrenner was
satisfied with the team's
performance, as this year's race
was much closer than last year.
OSU finished third at the Western
Sprints last season, and the
closeness of the Redwood City
race portends good things for the
future.
In the freshman eights,
Stanford topped OSU by seven
seconds, while in the JV event,
the Cardinals finished only a
length ahead of Santa Clara in a
good, tough race, with Southern
Cal a close third. The Trojans also
finished third in the varsity race.
This Saturday, the three teams
travel to Eugene to meet Oregon.
Stanford should be favored, as
OSU had little trouble beating the
Ducks earlier in the year.
