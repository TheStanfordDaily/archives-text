# USC Annihilates Trackmen
## 
### MARK WHITE 
LOS ANGELES - On a
pleasantly warm day here,
Stanford's track team suffered
through one of the most
unpleasant thrashings of recent
memory when the Cardinals were
dominated by USC 122-23
Saturday in a double dual track
meet at Ducky Drake Memorial
Stadium on the UCLA campus.
Officially billed as a combined
meet pitting UCLA against
UC-Berkeley and Stanford vs.
USC, Saturday's affair was viewed
by fans and press members as a
preview to the May 4 showdown
between college's two track
powerhouses, UCLA and USC, at
the L.A. Coliseum.
Although meet organizers
discouraged direct competition
between the schools by running
separate heats, on paper USC
would have won the showdown
74-71, based on the times of the
separate races.
But the margins of victory that
officially counted, 99 points for
UCLA, 40 for USC, were so
one-sided that not every team
member was employed in his
usual event. And the losing
coaches, well aware of the
hopelessness of their position,
took no chances of injuring
athletes by overworking them
Saturday.
"There were times where they
were hitting us pretty hard," said
coach Payton Jordan,"but we
were doing the best that we could.
Mark McConnell ran an excellent
two-mile and Derek Tolliver was
probably the best in the field for
us.
Fallen Chips
"For the most part our
emphasis was on pointing each
athlete toward his individual event
to maximize performance. We've
got to go and run our best and let
the chips fall where they may." ,
The following chips often did
not translate into points Saturday.
But McConnell was a shining star
amid all the darkness. McConnell
and teammate Jack Bellah
maximized performance" in the
two-mile as McConnell won in
8:55.9 and Bellah placed second
at 8:56.2, both times personal
bests.
McConnell and Bellah were
one-two for most of the first
seven laps of a race which
combined runners from all four
squads. McConnell opened a
10-yard lead over the pack en
route to a brisk 2:10 half mile.
Ballah then took over the lead and
posted a 4:25 first mile.
At the bell lap, McConnell and
Bellah were again one-two, but a
charging Cal runner, Brad Duffey
passed the Stanford pair with 220
yards to go, and won in a meet
record time of 8:52.8. UCLA's
Gary Nitty, normally a miler,
placed second at 8:55.0.
Sandoval Outkicked
Sandoval competed in the mile,

as did USC's best two-miler, Fred
Ritcherson (8:52.8). The result
was a come-from-behind Trojan
victory. Sandy took an early lead,
but failed to run away from
Ritcherson, who kicked home the
last quarter to win at 4:07.7.
Sandy was second at 4:11.5 and
Card freshman Steve Crowley
placed third at 4:13.6.
Cardinal frustrations were well
typified in the 120 high hurdles.
Hurdler Dave Bagshaw managed a
second place against the best
squad of high hurdlers in the
country when two USC
contestants crashed on the fifth
hurdle. But meet officials ruled
that the hurdles had been
incorrectly spaced and that the
race would have to be run again.
Subsequently, Ed Washington led
a USC sweep at 13.9, Bagshaw
placing fourth for no points.
Bagshaw had his troubles in the

intermediates also. Bagshaw and
teammate Matt Hogsett, both
usually strong finishers, were well
up in the field on the back
stretch, but faded out of
contention in the last 30 yards.
Trojan Tom Andrews won in 52.3
and Bagshaw was third at 53.3.
Frosh Heroes
Two Stanford freshmen
equalled lifetime bests in
competing against the superior
USC talent. Marvin Holmes placed
third in the 220 at 21.4, while
Bruce Wolfe lunged the last 20
yards for a second place in the
880 at 1:55.7, just nipping
teammate Ben Scheible.
Holmes led in the middle part
of his race, but was surpassed by
the late burst of Mike Shavers
(21.0) and Greg Jones (21.3).
"I really thought I had that
220," said Holmes. "I wasn't
really up for the race, but I knew

I could run pretty good times
here. I know I can get down
lower."
Tolliver came up with a third
place in the triple jump, going
48-1 for a seasonal best. Mike
Royer, recovered from pneumonia
sufficiently, placed third in the
discus at 156-4, while Tom
Banducci and Steve Hopkins took
thirds in the shot and javelin,
respectively. Ken Curl was third in
the 440 at 49.4.
But in the end, USC's depth of
excellence in the field events and
in the sprints demolished
Stanford. The Trojans swept five
events and held Stanford to one
first, that in the two-mile. The
team proved the Trojans are in the
same class as the Bruins, and the
May 4 dual between the schools
will be a classic.

"I really thought I had that
220," said Holmes. "I wasn't
really up for the race, but I knew

I could run pretty good times
here. I know I can get down
lower."
Tolliver came up with a third
place in the triple jump, going
48-1 for a seasonal best. Mike
Royer, recovered from pneumonia
sufficiently, placed third in the
discus at 156-4, while Tom
Banducci and Steve Hopkins took
thirds in the shot and javelin,
respectively. Ken Curl was third in
the 440 at 49.4.
But in the end, USC's depth of
excellence in the field events and
in the sprints demolished
Stanford. The Trojans swept five
events and held Stanford to one
first, that in the two-mile. The
team proved the Trojans are in the
same class as the Bruins, and the
May 4 dual between the schools
will be a classic.
LOS ANGELES - On a
pleasantly warm day here,
Stanford's track team suffered
through one of the most
unpleasant thrashings of recent
memory when the Cardinals were
dominated by USC 122-23
Saturday in a double dual track
meet at Ducky Drake Memorial
Stadium on the UCLA campus.
Officially billed as a combined
meet pitting UCLA against
UC-Berkeley and Stanford vs.
USC, Saturday's affair was viewed
by fans and press members as a
preview to the May 4 showdown
between college's two track
powerhouses, UCLA and USC, at
the L.A. Coliseum.
Although meet organizers
discouraged direct competition
between the schools by running
separate heats, on paper USC
would have won the showdown
74-71, based on the times of the
separate races.
But the margins of victory that
officially counted, 99 points for
UCLA, 40 for USC, were so
one-sided that not every team
member was employed in his
usual event. And the losing
coaches, well aware of the
hopelessness of their position,
took no chances of injuring
athletes by overworking them
Saturday.
"There were times where they
were hitting us pretty hard," said
coach Payton Jordan,"but we
were doing the best that we could.
Mark McConnell ran an excellent
two-mile and Derek Tolliver was
probably the best in the field for
us.
Fallen Chips
"For the most part our
emphasis was on pointing each
athlete toward his individual event
to maximize performance. We've
got to go and run our best and let
the chips fall where they may." ,
The following chips often did
not translate into points Saturday.
But McConnell was a shining star
amid all the darkness. McConnell
and teammate Jack Bellah
maximized performance" in the
two-mile as McConnell won in
8:55.9 and Bellah placed second
at 8:56.2, both times personal
bests.
McConnell and Bellah were
one-two for most of the first
seven laps of a race which
combined runners from all four
squads. McConnell opened a
10-yard lead over the pack en
route to a brisk 2:10 half mile.
Ballah then took over the lead and
posted a 4:25 first mile.
At the bell lap, McConnell and
Bellah were again one-two, but a
charging Cal runner, Brad Duffey
passed the Stanford pair with 220
yards to go, and won in a meet
record time of 8:52.8. UCLA's
Gary Nitty, normally a miler,
placed second at 8:55.0.
Sandoval Outkicked
Sandoval competed in the mile,

as did USC's best two-miler, Fred
Ritcherson (8:52.8). The result
was a come-from-behind Trojan
victory. Sandy took an early lead,
but failed to run away from
Ritcherson, who kicked home the
last quarter to win at 4:07.7.
Sandy was second at 4:11.5 and
Card freshman Steve Crowley
placed third at 4:13.6.
Cardinal frustrations were well
typified in the 120 high hurdles.
Hurdler Dave Bagshaw managed a
second place against the best
squad of high hurdlers in the
country when two USC
contestants crashed on the fifth
hurdle. But meet officials ruled
that the hurdles had been
incorrectly spaced and that the
race would have to be run again.
Subsequently, Ed Washington led
a USC sweep at 13.9, Bagshaw
placing fourth for no points.
Bagshaw had his troubles in the

intermediates also. Bagshaw and
teammate Matt Hogsett, both
usually strong finishers, were well
up in the field on the back
stretch, but faded out of
contention in the last 30 yards.
Trojan Tom Andrews won in 52.3
and Bagshaw was third at 53.3.
Frosh Heroes
Two Stanford freshmen
equalled lifetime bests in
competing against the superior
USC talent. Marvin Holmes placed
third in the 220 at 21.4, while
Bruce Wolfe lunged the last 20
yards for a second place in the
880 at 1:55.7, just nipping
teammate Ben Scheible.
Holmes led in the middle part
of his race, but was surpassed by
the late burst of Mike Shavers
(21.0) and Greg Jones (21.3).
"I really thought I had that
220," said Holmes. "I wasn't

Subsequently, Ed Washington led
a USC sweep at 13.9, Bagshaw
placing fourth for no points.
Bagshaw had his troubles in the

intermediates also. Bagshaw and
teammate Matt Hogsett, both
usually strong finishers, were well
up in the field on the back
stretch, but faded out of
contention in the last 30 yards.
Trojan Tom Andrews won in 52.3
and Bagshaw was third at 53.3.
Frosh Heroes
Two Stanford freshmen
equalled lifetime bests in
competing against the superior
USC talent. Marvin Holmes placed
third in the 220 at 21.4, while
Bruce Wolfe lunged the last 20
yards for a second place in the
880 at 1:55.7, just nipping
teammate Ben Scheible.
Holmes led in the middle part
of his race, but was surpassed by
the late burst of Mike Shavers
(21.0) and Greg Jones (21.3).
"I really thought I had that
220," said Holmes. "I wasn't
really up for the race, but I knew

I could run pretty good times
here. I know I can get down
lower."
Tolliver came up with a third
place in the triple jump, going
48-1 for a seasonal best. Mike
Royer, recovered from pneumonia
sufficiently, placed third in the
discus at 156-4, while Tom
Banducci and Steve Hopkins took
thirds in the shot and javelin,
respectively. Ken Curl was third in
the 440 at 49.4.
But in the end, USC's depth of
excellence in the field events and
in the sprints demolished
Stanford. The Trojans swept five
events and held Stanford to one
first, that in the two-mile. The
team proved the Trojans are in the
same class as the Bruins, and the
May 4 dual between the schools
will be a classic.
LOS ANGELES - On a
pleasantly warm day here,
Stanford's track team suffered
through one of the most
unpleasant thrashings of recent
memory when the Cardinals were
dominated by USC 122-23
Saturday in a double dual track
meet at Ducky Drake Memorial
Stadium on the UCLA campus.
Officially billed as a combined
meet pitting UCLA against
UC-Berkeley and Stanford vs.
USC, Saturday's affair was viewed
by fans and press members as a
preview to the May 4 showdown
between college's two track
powerhouses, UCLA and USC, at
the L.A. Coliseum.
Although meet organizers
discouraged direct competition
between the schools by running
separate heats, on paper USC
would have won the showdown
74-71, based on the times of the
separate races.
But the margins of victory that
officially counted, 99 points for
UCLA, 40 for USC, were so
one-sided that not every team
member was employed in his
usual event. And the losing
coaches, well aware of the
hopelessness of their position,
took no chances of injuring
athletes by overworking them
Saturday.
"There were times where they
were hitting us pretty hard," said
coach Payton Jordan,"but we
were doing the best that we could.
Mark McConnell ran an excellent
two-mile and Derek Tolliver was
probably the best in the field for
us.
Fallen Chips
"For the most part our
emphasis was on pointing each
athlete toward his individual event
to maximize performance. We've
got to go and run our best and let
the chips fall where they may." ,
The following chips often did
not translate into points Saturday.
But McConnell was a shining star
amid all the darkness. McConnell
and teammate Jack Bellah
maximized performance" in the
two-mile as McConnell won in
8:55.9 and Bellah placed second
at 8:56.2, both times personal
bests.
McConnell and Bellah were
one-two for most of the first
seven laps of a race which
combined runners from all four
squads. McConnell opened a
10-yard lead over the pack en
route to a brisk 2:10 half mile.
Ballah then took over the lead and
posted a 4:25 first mile.
At the bell lap, McConnell and
Bellah were again one-two, but a
charging Cal runner, Brad Duffey
passed the Stanford pair with 220
yards to go, and won in a meet
record time of 8:52.8. UCLA's
Gary Nitty, normally a miler,
placed second at 8:55.0.
Sandoval Outkicked
Sandoval competed in the mile,

as did USC's best two-miler, Fred
Ritcherson (8:52.8). The result
was a come-from-behind Trojan
victory. Sandy took an early lead,
but failed to run away from
Ritcherson, who kicked home the
last quarter to win at 4:07.7.
Sandy was second at 4:11.5 and
Card freshman Steve Crowley
placed third at 4:13.6.
Cardinal frustrations were well
typified in the 120 high hurdles.
Hurdler Dave Bagshaw managed a
second place against the best
squad of high hurdlers in the
country when two USC
contestants crashed on the fifth
hurdle. But meet officials ruled
that the hurdles had been
incorrectly spaced and that the
race would have to be run again.
Subsequently, Ed Washington led
a USC sweep at 13.9, Bagshaw
placing fourth for no points.
Bagshaw had his troubles in the

intermediates also. Bagshaw and
teammate Matt Hogsett, both
