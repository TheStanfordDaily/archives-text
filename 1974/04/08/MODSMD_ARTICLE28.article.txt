# Golf Team Fourth At Fresno Classic
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Two encouraging happenings
salvaged an otherwise
disappointing golf weekend as
Stanford finished fourth in the
Fresno State Classic at Fort
Washington Golf Course.
First, the Cards edged USC, the
nation's number-one ranked team.
Second, freshman Brent Murray
continued his amazing hot streak,
finishing third in the individual
competition.
Murry carded rounds of
73-75-72 for a four-over-par 220
total, just two strokes off the pace
set by U.S. Amateur champion
Craig Stadler of USC. Then, he
calmly walked back out on the
course and defeated San Jose
State's Mark Lye in a sudden
death playoff for the third place
trophy.
"The guy is almost
unbelievable," coach Bud Finger
said of his unassuming freshman

star who placed sixth two weeks
ago at the Pacific Coast
Invitational. "You
this guy's a real
player."
Aside from Murray, Conrad
Nilmeier was the Cards' only
individual threat. Nilmeier tied for
sixth at 223 after recovering from
a disastrous 41 on the front nine
in Saturday's final round. He
blistered the back side in 33 for a
74 to go with his earlier rounds of
73-76 on a course Finger said
"plays harder than it looks."
The veteran Stanford coach
was obviously pleased with
Murray's performance and the
Cards' victory over USC, but he
expressed disappointment in
Stanford's overall showing. "We
didn't start that fast or finish that
strong," Finger said. Except for a
moderately successful middle
round, "I think we should have
played better as a team."
Brigham Young ran away with
the team competition, compiling a
three-day, six-man total of 1345.
Arizona State finished second at
1358, followed by host Fresno
State (1368), Stanford (1371),
USC (1372) and San Jose State
(1373).
Dave Baskins, George Pettinger
and Glenn Goethels each shot 231
for the Cards, while Aly Trompas
slumped to a 235 total.

Golf Course in Santa Cruz, the
54-hole tournament, which begins
Wednesday and runs through
Friday, features a top-flight
25-team field, including all but
one of the top teams on the West
Coast. USC is not entered because
Stadler and Pac-8 champion Mark
Pfeil will be competing in the
Masters at Augusta, Ga.
Stanford's current competitive
averages are: Trompas (74.88),
Baskins (75.29), Murray (75.56),
Nimeier (75.88), Pettinger (76.00)
and Goethels (78.57).
Two encouraging happenings
salvaged an otherwise
disappointing golf weekend as
Stanford finished fourth in the
Fresno State Classic at Fort
Washington Golf Course.
First, the Cards edged USC, the
nation's number-one ranked team.
Second, freshman Brent Murray
continued his amazing hot streak,
finishing third in the individual
competition.
Murry carded rounds of
73-75-72 for a four-over-par 220
total, just two strokes off the pace
set by U.S. Amateur champion
Craig Stadler of USC. Then, he
calmly walked back out on the
course and defeated San Jose
State's Mark Lye in a sudden
death playoff for the third place
trophy.
"The guy is almost
unbelievable," coach Bud Finger
said of his unassuming freshman

star who placed sixth two weeks
ago at the Pacific Coast
Invitational. "You
this guy's a real
player."
Aside from Murray, Conrad
Nilmeier was the Cards' only
individual threat. Nilmeier tied for
sixth at 223 after recovering from
a disastrous 41 on the front nine
in Saturday's final round. He
blistered the back side in 33 for a
74 to go with his earlier rounds of
73-76 on a course Finger said
"plays harder than it looks."
The veteran Stanford coach
was obviously pleased with
Murray's performance and the
Cards' victory over USC, but he
expressed disappointment in
Stanford's overall showing. "We
didn't start that fast or finish that
strong," Finger said. Except for a
moderately successful middle
round, "I think we should have
played better as a team."
Brigham Young ran away with
the team competition, compiling a
three-day, six-man total of 1345.
Arizona State finished second at
1358, followed by host Fresno
State (1368), Stanford (1371),
USC (1372) and San Jose State
(1373).
Dave Baskins, George Pettinger
and Glenn Goethels each shot 231
for the Cards, while Aly Trompas
slumped to a 235 total.
