# Three Great Coaches Meet
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
LOS ANGELES â€” It was a beautiful day for
practicing up on the sport of watching UCLA
honeys. The smog factor was negligible and the hot
Southern California sun cooperated to insure that
the coeds wore their skimpiest outfits.
But for those who happened to be present
Saturday at UCLA's Drake Stadium, where four
Pacific Eight track teams were going at each other,
it was a perfect day to watch three of the top track
coaches in the nation.
These gentlemen have won 15 NCAA track
championships between them. UCLA coach Jim
Bush is a newcomer to the group, but he has made
up for his age by winning three NCAA titles in a
row.
Bush has the look of a Hollywood star, with his
stylish mod hair style and clothes which probably
came from some Beverly Hills men's store. If he
were a basketball coach on the Farm he would
probably give Messrs. Jones and Bowling some
serious competition. But some have criticized Bush
for his style, most notably former UCLA high
jumper Dwight Stones who quit the Bruins.
A Phony?
He's just so phony," said Stones. "Why once I
was working hard sweeping up the campus, and
Bush came styling up in his Cadillac and ignored
me.
Saturday as his Bruins were demolishing
California 92-52, Bush walked around Drake
Stadium shouting encouragement to his team and
confering with his team of assistants about each
event as if it were the most important of the
season.
He seemed very accessible, stopping to answer
the questions of the press while the meet was going
on. "I'm usually so wrapped up in a meet, that it
appears as though I'm off in another world," said
Bush.
Bush, however, doesn't seem to worry about
opponents who don't appear to pose any serious
threat to his Bruins. "I won't look at the Stanford
results untill the week we run against them," said
Bush.
USC's Wolfe
"Vern Wolfe is the dean of the track coaches in
America," said a former President of the Track
Writers of America. Wolfe's USC Trojans have
indeed won more NCAA track titles than any other
team, but there are some who have said that he has

lost his touch, since the last time the Trojans won
the NCAA's was way back in 1968.
Wolfe has reacted to this criticism by running
away from it. In last year's meet with UCLA, in
which USC suffered its worst loss to UCLA since he
has been at the helm, he didn't even stay to see the
end of it. Tracking down Wolfe for a quote last
year was about as hard as getting President Nixon
to a news conference.
But things were different Saturday. Wolfe's
Trojans were demolishing the Cards and he even
stuck around Drake Stadium for over an hour
talking with the press.
"It was a shame to see Payton's team so down.
We all love him, but this year his team just doesn't
have it. They're still good competitors though,"
said Wolfe.
Wolfe seemed no different than Bush as he also
walked around Drake with the look of a man
confident that his team will beat its crosstown
MVAL.
Jordan's Problems
Stanford coach Payton Jordan, like his
colleagues in the coaching profession, walked
around shouting encouragement to his team. But
more often than not he was consoling a trackstar
after a loss. Payton didn't have the members of the
Los Angeles media gathered around him after the
meet as did Wolfe and Bush, instead he spent a half
an hour talking to one of the few Stanford boosters
who witnessed the debacle.
Jordan, the coach of the 1968 Olympic team,
looked as though he was ready to walk right into an
Olympic stadium instead of Westwood. He was the
only coach who wore a sport jacket and the white
loafers and pinstriped pants he wore complemented
his outfit.
He was philisophical about yielding one of the
highest winning score that the Trojans have ever
piled up. "We were going out to get individual
bests..We put emphasis on pointing each person
toward his individual event to help his
performance."
While most of the cheers in Drake were for USC
and UCLA Jordan said, "Sometimes it's harder to
run when you're losing than when you're winning.
I've been on both sides of the coin."
USC's Wolfe took out his crystal ball to make a
prediction about Jordan, "He'll be back. He's down
now but Payton's a great guy so he'll bounce
back."
