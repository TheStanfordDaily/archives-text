# Campus 'Community Center'
## Tresidder Seeks New Role 
### CECILE HEROLD 
"Presently Tresidder is looked upon
by many students as just a bank, ticket
office and cafeteria," said Jim
Montoya, Tresidder Union Program
Board member.
Montoya and the other seven board
members, all undergraduates, are
currently attempting to change
Tresidder Union's image to that of a
"community center."
"Dorms basically provide students
with social activities, but what about
the 25 percent who live off-campus or
those who live in dorms but feel
isolated and would like to meet people
from other dorms? Tresidder will
become a community place, a neutral
territory," Montoya said.

The board's function, according to
several board members, is to provide
ideas for new social, recreational,
academic and cultural activities at
Tresidder for on- and off-campus
residents, faculty, and staff.
"A campus union should be a place
where students, faculty, and staff can
come together, relax, and have fun,"
said Roger Thacker, Tresidder
Programs Manager and the Program
Board's advisor.
Lots Of Activities
"The main goal of the board is to
make Tresidder a real community
center with lots of activities for lots of
people," Thacker said. "It will sort of
snowball—once things start happening,
more people will see Tresidder's

potential. It's everybody's place."
"The board has been meeting since
January," said Thacker. "I'm really
pleased at how they've jumped in."
Already the board has proposed at
least eight solid ideas for programs.
The first is an all-campus dance to be
held in the Tresidder cafeteria this
Friday. Others include the
continuation of the Tresidder Film
Series featuring the TV oldies night on
April 13. You Asked For it, The
Honeymooners, and Death Valley
Days will re-appear on the screen along
with Jimmy Durante.
"Never before" programs include a
wine-tasting trip to the Napa Valley,
with the connoisseurs traveling by
chartered bus. scheduled for Saturday,
April 13. The price is $4.50, slightly
higher if you buy a box lunch.
Disneyland Trip
Next, a weekend fling at
Disneyland, transportation again by
chartered bus, is slated for May 3, 4,
and 5. Two nights' hotel lodging,
admission to the park, all ride tickets
and the bus transportation will cost
$34.90.
According to Thacker, "We will be
charging basically the cost of the
excursion and picking up the tab
ourselves for publicity and staff time.
It's a good deal."
Cindy Ellwood, a freshman board
member from Minnesota, said the
off-campus excursions will help people
to know the area, while the travelers
get to know one another.
A white water rafting trip on the
Stanislaus River has not yet been
finalized but will take place as a
weekend camping event sometime in
late May.
Cultural Diversity Fair
During the week of May 20, the
Tresidder Board plans to host a culture
diversity fair throughout the campus
with activities centralized at Tresidder
Union. "This will be a week-long focus
on the cultural diversity of the people
at Stanford with talks, crafts shows,
food, and folk dancing," explained
sophomore board member Rick
Redman.
Among academic events, Mareie
Axelrod, the chairwoman of the
board, has suggested the organization
of an emeritus lecture/discussion
series. Retired University professors
will be invited to Tresidder to give
informal lectures followed by
refreshments and discussion.
"Emeriti professors still feel like a
part of Stanford and want to know
students on a regular basis. These are
interesting people; when they leave we
just can't say good-bye," Thacker said.
The dates for the series are to be
announced.
Thacker emphasized that students
are invited to call him at Tresidder
with any questions or suggestions
regarding board activities.

with social activities, but what about
the 25 percent who live off-campus or
those who live in dorms but feel
isolated and would like to meet people
from other dorms? Tresidder will
become a community place, a neutral
territory," Montoya said.

The board's function, according to
several board members, is to provide
ideas for new social, recreational,
academic and cultural activities at
Tresidder for on- and off-campus
residents, faculty, and staff.
"A campus union should be a place
where students, faculty, and staff can
come together, relax, and have fun,"
said Roger Thacker, Tresidder
Programs Manager and the Program
Board's advisor.
Lots Of Activities
"The main goal of the board is to
make Tresidder a real community
center with lots of activities for lots of
people," Thacker said. "It will sort of
snowball—once things start happening,
more people will see Tresidder's

potential. It's everybody's place."
"The board has been meeting since
January," said Thacker. "I'm really
pleased at how they've jumped in."
Already the board has proposed at
least eight solid ideas for programs.
The first is an all-campus dance to be
held in the Tresidder cafeteria this
Friday. Others include the
continuation of the Tresidder Film
Series featuring the TV oldies night on
April 13. You Asked For it, The
Honeymooners, and Death Valley
Days will re-appear on the screen along
with Jimmy Durante.
"Never before" programs include a
wine-tasting trip to the Napa Valley,
with the connoisseurs traveling by
chartered bus. scheduled for Saturday,
April 13. The price is $4.50, slightly
higher if you buy a box lunch.
Disneyland Trip
Next, a weekend fling at
Disneyland, transportation again by
chartered bus, is slated for May 3, 4,
and 5. Two nights' hotel lodging,
admission to the park, all ride tickets
and the bus transportation will cost
$34.90.
According to Thacker, "We will be
charging basically the cost of the
excursion and picking up the tab
ourselves for publicity and staff time.
It's a good deal."
Cindy Ellwood, a freshman board
member from Minnesota, said the
off-campus excursions will help people
to know the area, while the travelers
get to know one another.
A white water rafting trip on the
Stanislaus River has not yet been
finalized but will take place as a
weekend camping event sometime in
late May.
Cultural Diversity Fair
During the week of May 20, the
Tresidder Board plans to host a culture
diversity fair throughout the campus
with activities centralized at Tresidder
Union. "This will be a week-long focus
on the cultural diversity of the people
at Stanford with talks, crafts shows,
food, and folk dancing," explained
sophomore board member Rick
Redman.
Among academic events, Mareie
Axelrod, the chairwoman of the
board, has suggested the organization
of an emeritus lecture/discussion
series. Retired University professors
will be invited to Tresidder to give
informal lectures followed by
refreshments and discussion.
"Emeriti professors still feel like a
part of Stanford and want to know
students on a regular basis. These are
interesting people; when they leave we
just can't say good-bye," Thacker said.
The dates for the series are to be
announced.
Thacker emphasized that students
are invited to call him at Tresidder
with any questions or suggestions
regarding board activities.
"Presently Tresidder is looked upon
by many students as just a bank, ticket
office and cafeteria," said Jim
Montoya, Tresidder Union Program
Board member.
Montoya and the other seven board
members, all undergraduates, are
currently attempting to change
Tresidder Union's image to that of a
"community center."
