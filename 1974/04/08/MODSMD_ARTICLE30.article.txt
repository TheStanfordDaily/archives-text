# Hug Wins Another All-A round
## 
### 
Steve Hug concluded his
brilliant career as a Stanford
gymnast by winning yet another
NCAA all-around title, his third in
succession. He becomes only the
second person to accomplish this
feat.
Along with his defense of the
all-around title, Hug, a senior
from Northridge, won the parallel
bars competition and placed
second in the horizontal bars. The
triumphs cemented his
already-strong lock on the Nissen
Award, annually given the
nation's outstanding senior
gymnast. He received the award
Saturday night.
In the all-around, which
concluded Friday at the NCAA's
held at Penn State, Hug won with
a score of 108.95, well ahead of
second-place Doug Fitzjarrell of
lowa State, at 108.05, and
third-place Wayne Young of
Brigham Young, with 107.30.
The next day, Hug concluded
his easy triumph in the parallel
bars, his 18.925 score nearly
four-tenths of a point better than
his nearest competitor. He
finished second in the horizontal
bars, only one-tenth of a point
away from the winner, an Indiana
State gymnast.
But Hug wasn't Stanford's only
big story at the three-day event.
Sophomore Ted Marcy scored an
extremely impressive win in the
pommel (side) horse, a big
improvement over his fourth place
finish last season. With Hug
leaving, March should lead coach
Sadao Hamada's team into action
next year.
One other Cardinal gymnast
also placed in the top six, that
being senior Howard Bessen in the
rings, who finished fifth with an
18.625 mark, three-tenths of a
point from first place. Bessen's
new optional routine paced the
way to his finish, one place higher
than in 1972.
Stanford did not qualify a full
team to take part in competition.
However, the school's three firsts
were better than any other school,
including winner lowa State.
Arizona State finished second,
over four points behind the
Cyclones, with California the only
other team to reach the
three-team final event.
During the season, California
supplied two of Stanford's four
losses. The Cards finished with
only one win in dual competition
due to their rough schedule and
lack of depth in the parallel bars
and high bar.
Hamada expressed satisfaction
at the season. "The guys all
improved from last year, so I'm
pretty happy with them," he said.
