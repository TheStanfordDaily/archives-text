UP AND OVER-USC's Dean
Owens (top) broke his own
high jump meet record
Saturday when he clcared
7-1/4 to win the event in
USC's Pac-8 drubbing of
Stanford. Meanwhile,
Stanford's Ken Kring
(bottom) easily glides over
the bar at the 14 foot mark.
The vault was not up to
standard, however, as Kring
didn't place in the event.
